president reagan says his signing of a complex 
antidrug abuse bill gives the nation a new sword and shield in 
the battle against illegal substances 
joined by hundreds of citizens police officers and congressional 
supporters of the measure reagan on friday turned the east room 
bill signing ceremony into a tribute to his wife nancy 
the first lady has made the just say no antidrug campaign 
among youngsters a major activity during her years in the white 
house 
and now in the eleventh hour of this presidency we give a new 
sword and shield to those whose daily business it is to eliminate 
from americas streets and towns the scourge of illicit drugs 
reagan said 
the president praised the measures toughened approach to any and 
all drug abusers from recreational users to drug kingpins 
reagan praised his wife for her eightyear battle to not only 
rid our society of drugs but to banish any lingering tolerance of 
the notion that drugs are cool or hip 
the nation now acknowledges what nancy has been saying for the 
past several years that drugs give a false high he said 
after giving his wife a big hug and kiss on the mouth the 
president presented mrs reagan with the pen he used to sign the 
fourinch thick bill 
the new law aims to attack the use of illegal drugs through 
stricter law enforcement tougher penalties and increased 
treatment rehabilitation and education 
and in a separate area it toughens child pornography laws and 
creates a new federal offense for those engaged in the business 
of distributing obscene materials 
the measure provides about 500 million for spending in the 
nations battle against drugs even though the bills authors had 
estimated it would cost 14 billion in the first year alone to 
finance all provisions of the legislation 
the bill calls for the new president to name a cabinetlevel 
drug czar a position that pays 99500 a year and must be 
confirmed by the senate 
the czar officially known as the national drug policy director 
must outline an overall plan for enforcement and treatment programs 
known as the national drug control strategy 
the law grants the new official virtually unprecedented powers 
particularly in the right to intervene in the budgetmaking process 
of government agencies 
the 30 or so agencies involved in antidrug programs will be 
required to submit their proposed drug budgets to the czar who will 
have the power to revise them if they do not comply with the 
strategy document 
the bipartisan measure was approved on a 34611 vote in the house 
and passed by voice vote in the senate in the waning days of the 
congressional session last month 
the bill contains stiff penalties for drug traffickers and users 
serious drug offenses would carry stiffer minimum prison terms 
the measure also makes it possible for those possessing small 
quantities of drugs intended for personal use to be hit with up to 
10000 in civil fines although they would have the right to court 
review 
beginning next september those convicted of drug offenses could 
face loss of student loans and other federal benefits including 
public housing grants contracts loans mortgage guarantees and 
some forms of veterans aid it would not include social security 
medicare welfare benefits veterans disability and other safety 
net programs 
drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while 
committing drugrelated felonies could themselves be executed under 
a new revitalized federal death penalty however the 
constitutionality of that provision is in doubt and it is certain to 
face court challenges should federal officials attempt to use it 
the new law also makes it a federal felony to dispense anabolic 
steroids without a prescription and establishes a maximum penalty 
of up to three years in prison plus fines 
since it will be up to presidentelect george bush to name the 
new czar speculation has centered on a number of possible nominees 
including associate attorney general francis b keating customs 
commissioner william von raab and drug enforcement administration 
chief jack lawn among others 
reagan also signed legislation friday to 
end the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean by 1992 by closing 
the nations last remaining sludge dumping site about 106 miles off 
the new jersey coast 
provide a 41 percent costofliving increase in the 
compensation paid to the nearly 22 million military veterans with 
serviceconnected disabilities the same percentage increase which 
will become effective dec 1 will also be provided the 
approximately 323000 surviving spouses and dependents of veterans 
whose deaths were serviceconnected

a federal judge on thursday said the us fish and 
wildlife services decision not to designate the northern spotted 
owl as an endangered species was illegal 
us district judge thomas s zilly issued a written decision 
calling the services action arbitrary and capricious expanding 
upon his ruling on nov 9 according to a news release issued by the 
sierra club legal defense club 
zilly ordered the fish and wildlife service to review its 
decision and explain it within 90 days 
the ruling was a victory for environmentalists the spotted owl 
is considered an indicator species meaning it represents other 
creatures that depend upon the same ecosystem the northern spotted 
owl lives in the remnants of the pacific northwests ancient 
oldgrowth forests 
zilly found the fish and wildlife service had no expert analysis 
backing its conclusion that the owl is not endangered 
rather the expert opinion is entirely to the contrary he 
wrote 
the service disregarded all the expert opinion on population 
viability including that of its own expert that the owl is facing 
extinction the service has failed to provide its own or other 
expert analysis supporting its conclusions he said 
a spokesman for the fish and wildlife services portland ore 
office could not be reached for comment 
zilly also said the agency mischaracterized the conclusions of 
mark boyce a timber industry consultant when it concluded boyce 
did not believe the spotted owl faced extinction 
zilly noted boyce wrote to the agency and said he did not 
conclude the owl has a low probability of extinction and that he 
would be very disappointed if efforts to preserve the owl were 
thwarted by a misrepresentation of his work 
more than 25 environmental groups filed the case after the fish 
and wildlife service decided last december not to list the owl as 
endangered or threatened under the federal endangered species act 
spotted owls have been on washington states endangered list 
since january about 600 pairs of the owls remain in the state the 
state wildlife department estimates

democrat bruce g sundlun was ready to 
concede the governors race after picking up only 61 votes on 
republican gov edward diprete during a recount ended thursday 
sundluns campaign manager said 
sundlun is to make the concession speech monday almost two weeks 
after the nov 8 general election said campaign manager kenneth 
haupt 
i dont think there will be a bitter tone to it he was pleased 
with the tone of the campaign and the showing he made haupt said 
i think hes going to make it clear that bruce sundlun is not 
disappearing because hes not 
sundlun a millionaire communications executive was in 
washington on business and unavailable to comment before then haupt 
said 
the unofficial tally before the recount was 202962 for diprete 
and 196188 for sundlun giving diprete a lead of 6774 votes 
frank williams vice chairman of the state elections board said 
it would be about 10 days before the final tallies would be 
certified 
were pretty well completed we just have to recalculate the 
changes on the tabulation sheets he said 
of 1806 machines only about 10 had any changes discovered 
during the recount he said thats par for the course williams 
said 
the recount which was expected to take three days began 
wednesday and went more quickly than expected he said officials 
from both dipretes and sundluns campaigns hovered around elections 
officials as they opened the back of each machine and read the 
meters 
i knew at about 11 oclock on election night that it was 
over haupt said but i saw that bruce wanted to know for 
absolutely sure that he lost so thats why i asked for a recount 
sundlun lost to diprete by a 2to1 margin in 1986 but this year 
sundlun parlayed repeated questions about dipretes ethics into the 
close race 
haupt said the sundlun campaign office would be closed next 
tuesday 
dipretes spokeswoman could not be reached for comment

the government is looking for ways to halt the 
spread of destructive honey bee mites 
although not known to be harmful to other creatures the mites 
varroa jacobsoni were first discovered in the united states in 
september 1987 in a wisconsin apiary and since have spread to 17 
other states 
beekeeping is credited by usda with the pollination of many 
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around 20 
billion those include many fruits vegetables and hay crops 
james w glosser administrator of the agriculture departments 
animal and plant health inspection service said thursday a 
15member department advisory committee will draft regulations to 
prevent further spread of the destructive mites 
the panel will include representatives of state departments of 
agriculture beekeeping organizations and related groups the 
committees first meeting will be held in washington nov 30 through 
dec 2 glosser said 
the usda agency imposed a federal quarantine last april to 
restrict movement of bees and bee equipment from infested states but 
canceled it a month later when the regulations proved too complex 
to administer successfully 
glosser said the committee will employ negotiated rulemaking 
to form federal regulations acceptable to the various parts of the 
bee industry 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood department experts have described the 
female as about onetwentieth of an inch in diameter with the male 
somewhat smaller 
infestations can cause decreased brood numbers deformed bees and 
weakening of the colonys ability to pollinate plants and produce 
honey the mites can infest a colony so gradually that it may be 
unnoticed until serious damage has occurred 
besides wisconsin states where the mites have been found are 
florida georgia illinois indiana maine massachusetts michigan 
minnesota mississippi nebraska new york north dakota ohio 
pennsylvania south carolina south dakota and washington 
glosser said the public can submit written statements at the 
meeting or they can be sent before the meeting to helene wright

the skimpy us soybean harvest this year not 
only has helped boost prices for american farmers but it has helped 
trigger rapid expansion among foreign oilseed competitors says the 
agriculture department 
drought left soybean output at a 12year low of 15 billion 
bushels down 21 percent from the 1987 harvest with corn belt 
producers suffering the brunt of the yield losses 
the usda says soybean prices could average 675 to 875 per 
bushel in the marketing year that began on sept 1 compared with 
615 last season and 478 in 198687 
meanwhile the departments economic research service is also 
keeping an eye on oilseed developments overseas particularly in 
argentina and brazil where planting for next years harvest began 
in september and will continue through next month 
total argentine oilseed area is expected to jump 16 percent to 
just under 9 million hectares of which 77 million hectares are 
soybean and sunflower seed the agency said in a recent outlook 
report 
for the first time the report added argentinas planted area of 
oilseeds is expected to exceed its grain area a hectare the 
metric unit is equal to about 247 acres 
in brazil soybean plantings are forecast to expand more than 9 
percent to 115 million hectares 
the expansion in south america which could be even greater if 
world soybean prices edge higher comes on the heels of record 
soybean harvests this year in both argentina and brazil 
as a result of the larger yield of soybeans and a reduced amount 
used for crushing or processing into oil and meal both countries 
have ample supplies available for export in 198889 the report said 
together argentina and brazil could export around 7 million 
metric tons of soybeans and 15 million tons of soybean meal in the 
coming year up 48 percent and 32 percent respectively from 
198788 
one metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of soybeans 
the united states remains far in front as the worlds leading 
producer of soybeans but the reduced 1988 harvest and short 
supplies have given other producers a big step up into the global 
market 
a recent usda supplyanddemand analysis showed that the world 
output of soybeans in 198889 is expected to be about 94 million 
tons down from nearly 1029 million tons last year 
the united states droughtshrunken harvest will provide more 
than 41 million tons of this seasons world total or about 40 
percent in 198788 the us share was about 523 million tons or 
about 51 percent of the years total output 
with reduced inventories the us export total is expected to 
drop to about 154 million tons in 198889 from 218 million tons 
last year the soybean inventory left over at the end of the current 
marketing year will be drawn down to a barebones of around 34 
million tons by the time the 1989 harvest is ready 
translated the us soybean harvest in 1988 of a little more 
than 15 billion bushels is not enough to meet all domestic and 
export demands those demands are expected to total almost 169 
billion bushels 
as a result the stockpile of beans from previous harvests will 
be tapped to meet the demands leaving only about 125 million 
bushels in reserve when the current soybean marketing year ends in 
next aug 31 down from 302 million bushels this sept 1 
but those and the market price outlook are only current 
projections and usda economists say the situation will depend 
significantly on how new plantings wind up in argentina and brazil 
where spring is under way

the head of americas roman catholic bishops 
declared we are in a most serene time even though they had 
just ended a week that included open dispute with the vatican and 
revival of their sniping at the government 
archbishop john l may of st louis was referring in particular 
on thursday to the us churchs relations with pope john paul ii 
and the vatican 
he pronounced the pope bullish on the church in the united 
states and dismissed public spats with rome as merely signs of a 
church that is essentially open 
in fact he and fellow members of the national conference of 
catholic bishops seemed little troubled by any of the controversy 
that swirled about them during their annual meeting that concluded 
thursday 
during the week the bishops 
took on the soviet union decrying sustained and 
comprehensive religious persecution in eastern europe and 
encouraging the us government to hold out prospects of better 
overall relations as an incentive to win greater religious freedom 
blasted a us immigration law they say leads employers to 
discriminate in hiring and firing hispanics out of ignorance 
concerning potential penalties 
criticized the reagan administration for sending out thousands 
of foreclosure warnings to family farmers a week after the 
presidential election and just before the holiday season 
on their own turf accepted but only grudgingly a vatican 
intervention that kept them from voting on guidelines they had 
prepared for resolving disputes with theologians 
approved rules for lay preachers that either according to which 
bishop you asked made it easier for lay men and women to preach 
during masses or took one more slap at catholic women by reiterating 
that they may not give the main sermon interpreting the gospel 
finally sent back a vatican draft document as unsuitable as a 
basis for discussion thus rejecting both the scholarship of the 
draft and its contention that national bishops conferences have no 
real authority in the church 
may had started the week by congratulating presidentelect george 
bush but then in the next breath assuring him the bishops would 
continue to speak out on public issues and not only in praise and 
appreciation 
we are sometimes criticized for being too concerned about the 
world of pursuing an agenda that in the minds of some critics is 
secular leftist or in some way ideological may said but he 
added that the popes own example showed it is not possible to have 
too much social consciousness 
on wednesday former conference president john roach bishop of 
st paulminneapolis was asked about the arguing that preceded 
passage of the bishops response to the vatican document on 
conference authority and about the relatively high number of no 
votes 59 among the 264 voting 
he acknowledged differences of opinion within the organization 
and suggested some of the negative votes might have included bishops 
getting a secretvote chance to take a shot at the recent past 
presidents who prepared the response 
but in proclaiming the bishops serenity on thursday may said 
there was no big dispute with the vatican and he quoted the pope to 
support his own contention 
the pope is bullish on the church in the united states thats 
what he says may declared 
in recent meetings with us bishops the pope had said you 
are a superpower may told reporters he said the pope merely 
asked the americans to weigh their words with the knowledge that 
the church in the united states has tremendous international 
influence and the people of the world watch what is said there 
there are disagreements from time to time with the vatican 
may said but he added that he didnt see them as a tugofwar or 
an ongoing fight or crisis or any of these words that are used 
he said the pope often uses the term solidarity in regard to 
the church helping build bridges with the people of the world 
including the most vulnerable as well as the powerful 
this years bishops meeting was significant may said partly 
because we tried to demonstrate solidarity across an amazingly 
broad spectrum 
such efforts he suggested indicated the conference was alive 
and well whatever the final draft of the vatican document might say 
as to its theological authority

a consumer group and the attorney general of 
new york filed a petition asking the government to ban some crib 
toys they said could harm infants 
the petition said at least 49 children had been killed or injured 
by crib toys over the past 15 years 
the request was filed thursday with the consumer product safety 
commission by new york attorney general robert abrams and the 
consumer federation of america which is a coalition of more than 
250 consumer advocacy organizations 
the toys in question are crib gyms mobiles activity boxes 
suspended stuffed toys mirrors music boxes and others marketed for 
use in cribs and playpens 
nothing could be more devastating to a parent than the 
knowledge that a toy purchased to amuse an infant child ended up 
causing that childs death abrams said the numbers over the 
past 15 years indicate a clear need for tougher safety standards if 
we hope to prevent additional tragedies 
the petition asks the consumer product safety agency to determine 
that certain crib toys intended for use by children present a 
mechanical hazard and therefore are banned hazardous substances 
mary ellen fise spokeswoman for the consumer federation of 
america said her organization was recommending that people not buy 
these toys for christmas 
in their petition abrams and the federation cited a 1987 
consumer product safety commission report which found that between 
1973 and 1987 30 deaths one case of severe brain damage and 18 
near misses were caused by crib toys 
some children were strangled by pullcords on the toys while 
others got their clothing caught in protrusions and choked 
according to the petition another child got his hand caught in a 
pull ring and in an effort to disengage it rolled over and hanged 
himself 
the petition also seeks labels to warn consumers to use the toys 
with both ends attached to opposite crib sides six incidents 
including one death have occurred where an unattached end of a crib 
gym wrapped around a childs neck they said 
the commission staff has estimated that based on 1984 data there 
are approximately 350000 crib gyms and 800000 crib mobiles in use 
unfortunately this is another case where the cpsc has decided 
to look the other way and ignore their own inhouse study fise 
said 
dave shiflett a spokesman for the safety commission said the 
agency had received the petition thursday and the staff would review 
it 
if the staff determines it meets our requirements it will be 
docketed and then further studied by the commission he said 
docketing could take as little as 30 days but the entire 
procedure leading up to a decision by the commissioners could take 
as long as two or three years said doug noble another commission 
spokesman

the food and drug administration is telling 
aspirin makers to warn women not to take the popular pain killer 
during the last three months of pregnancy lest they risk prolonged 
labor and unnecessary bleeding 
aspirin products already must carry the standard warning as 
with any drug if you are pregnant or nursing a baby seek the advice 
of a health professional before using this product 
this additional wording would be required under the fda proposal 
issued thursday important do not take this product during the 
last three months of pregnancy unless directed by a doctor aspirin 
taken near the time of delivery may cause bleeding problems in both 
mother and child 
a similar warning already is required for ibuprofen the pain 
reliever used in such products as advil and nuprin 
although it could be a year before the fda will be able to impose 
the new labeling requirements formally officials said aspirin 
manufacturers probably will move sooner to comply since there is 
little chance the agency will change its mind 
indeed the proposal stems from the virtually undisputed 
conclusion of an outside advisory panel that aspirin can contribute 
to bleeding problems for both mother and baby and prolong labor and 
should be taken only with utmost caution 
however there is somewhat less consensus on some companion 
proposals contained in what the fda calls an internal analgesic 
monograph published in the federal register that deals with a number 
of issues involving nonprescription pain relievers 
for example it notes that while the outside advisory panel found 
insufficient evidence that caffeine increases the effective action 
of other ingredients in popular pain relievers the drug makers have 
submitted additional data 
as a result the fda said products such as excedrin and anacin 
can continue to include caffeine while the issue is reviewed more 
fully 
an accompanying proposal on nonprescription menstrual products 
would permit use of caffeine in combination with various pain 
relievers to relieve menstrual cramps and discomfort 
the fda has concluded caffeine is useful in these applications as 
a diuretic a substance that inhibits the retention of fluids 
the document also incorporates suggested guidelines for 
physicians in advising their patients on aspirin use to help 
prevent recurrences of transient ischemic attacks sometimes called 
little strokes or heart attack or angina 
and it says the fda eventually will settle on label wording on 
the effect aspirin may have on reducing the risk of initial heart 
attacks 
the agency said it is awaiting more data from a study published 
last winter that suggested a reduction of heart attack risk among 
healthy adult males who took an aspirin every other day

the commander of a marine corps recruit depot 
has been urged to deny clemency to a female corporal convicted of 
homosexual conduct the woman claims she was promised leniency by a 
prosecutor in exchange for her cooperation 
cpl barbara j baum 24 of mishawaka ind was convicted at 
court martial last june and sentenced to a year in prison as part of 
a wideranging investigation of alleged lesbian conduct among 
instructors at the parris island recruit depot 
she is serving her sentence in a brig at the quantico va 
marine base 
this lady has been in prison for five months already for in 
essence engaging in private consensual sexual conduct l 
barrett boss a washington defense attorney said thursday 
she was promised some form of clemency in exchange for 
cooperating with investigators after her sentencing which she 
did he said and now the staff judge advocate lawyer at 
parris island is recommending clemency be denied they certainly 
misled her no question 
the marine corps denies the prosecuting attorney in the case ever 
made a binding promise to the enlisted woman in soliciting her 
cooperation with investigators 
if we had done so we would honor it said maj robert 
mclean a spokesman at parris island 
earlier this month in a memorandum dated nov 8 the top staff 
lawyer at parris island recommended that base commander maj gen 
jarvis d lynch deny baum any clemency 
col gerald w jones the staff judge advocate noted briefly in 
his memo the prosecutor in baums case maj david beck had 
recommended a reduction in sentence because of her posttrial 
cooperation and because of corroboration of claims that she 
had been sexually abused as a child 
nonetheless jones recommended the general approve the sentence 
as adjudged 
the only explanation jones offered was a single sentence stating 
no corrective action based upon trial error or the review 
procedure is appropriate 
mclean said thursday he could not elaborate on jones reasons for 
urging clemency be denied but the spokesman noted it would be up to 
lynch to decide the matter after reviewing everyones input 
i can say categorically that there is not now nor was there 
ever any agreement consummated between the defense and government 
relative to baums case for any kind of clemency reduction or 
relief the spokesman said 
it is true there was no written agreement between them 
responded boss but barbara baum did not spent 14 hours being 
interrogated under oath by investigators for her health 
she had a clear understanding that in exchange for her 
cooperation she would get clemency she never would have consented 
to going through this ordeal if she did not think she was going 
to get some clemency 
baum has testified she was sexually abused by several men while a 
child and now wants to obtain therapy the defense attorney said 
there is no treatment available for cpl baum in the quantico 
brig he said 
boss said he and another civilian defense attorney susan 
masling would file a response to jones memo within a week setting 
the stage for lynch to rule on the matter

democratic state party leaders are doing a 
postmortem on yet another presidential election defeat and 
appealing to paul g kirk jr to serve another term as national 
chairman to avert a potentially divisive contest for his job 
also on the minds of democratic leaders are questions about 
whether the party needs to reexamine its method of nominating 
presidential candidates after its fifth defeat in the last six 
national elections 
i dont think we ought to go leaping off any cliffs said 
kathy vick a former louisiana democratic party chair 
one thing im going to resist and resist as forcefully as i can 
is the overreaction overanalysis overrevisionist theory of 
politics said kirk 
much of the attention at a twoday meeting of the association of 
state democratic chairs beginning today will be on kirk who has 
refused to say whether he would serve another fouryear term his 
term expires in february 
at least five people whod like to succeed kirk planned to attend 
the meeting at a resort outside the arizona capital 
they include rick wiener the michigan democratic party chairman 
who is president of the state chairs association ron brown a 
washington attorney who was a top adviser to jesse jackson in the 
final weeks of his presidential campaign and three former 
congressmen jim jones of oklahoma michael barnes of maryland and 
jim stanton of ohio 
when democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis carried only 
10 states while losing to republican george bush it still was the 
best showing by a democratic nominee since 1976 
the democrats have been on the losing side in five of the last 
six presidential elections but have controlled the house for 33 
years and have been the majority party in the senate for 27 of those 
33 years 
while dukakis was losing the democrats added one senate seat and 
three house seats 
several state party officials who had thought 1988 would be a 
democratic year have been sharply critical of the dukakis campaign 
the worst campaign of this century said bob slagle chairman 
of the texas democratic party 
slagle criticized dukakis for failing to respond quickly and 
strongly enough to attacks by the bush campaign 
we never gave people a reason to vote for us said james 
ruvolo the ohio party chairman 
kirk has said that party leaders who have asked him to stay on 
the job have cited his success at promoting unity among differing 
factions 
im going to listen to the counsel of a number of the leaders 
and elected officials in the party who have said dont say you 
wont stay on until we have an opportunity to chat with you about 
it so thats my plan 
i owe it to them to visit with them and hear what they have to 
say 
kirk ruled out staying on for a partial term 
at the same time kirk dismissed predictions that a fight to fill 
the chairmanship would be divisive 
i dont foresee in any circumstances the socalled 
bloodletting and the division within the party he said 
brown who has served as deputy party chairman and counsel in the 
past is opposed by activists who believe his election would give 
jackson too much power 
brown conceded his chances would depend on reminding party 
officials that i wasnt born in may when he joined the jackson 
campaign and that i did have a life before then 
he said many of the people who are raising the jackson 
connection are the same ones who were telling me how glad they were 
and how wonderful it was that he had agreed to be jacksons 
convention manager 
at the time democratic party officials expressed relief that a 
party establishment figure like brown was going to play a prominent 
role advising jackson

a former high school student and his parents 
have filed a 2 million libel lawsuit over antisemitic slurs and 
sexual innuendos printed beside his picture in the 1986 school 
yearbook 
michael strauss and his parents sheldon and judith strauss 
filed the lawsuit in norfolk superior court against the town of 
westwood westwood high school officials two unnamed students and a 
publishing company 
the strausses say a fictitious 70word biographical sketch that 
appeared beside their sons senior picture describing him as 
superjew and yidmaster was false and defamatory and caused 
him emotional harm the biography also contained sexual innuendoes 
the false biography was substituted for strauss own statement by 
two students and printed in yearbooks distributed to about 250 
students a similar false biography was printed beside the picture 
of a student of lebanese descent 
school officials asked students to return yearbooks after the 
tampering was discovered but the incident was not made public until 
march 1987 months after the yearbooks were distributed 
school committee chairman joseph quinn said school officials did 
not want to go public for fear of a lawsuit and also because they 
wanted to spare the families more embarrassment 
neither school officials nor the strauss family would comment on 
the lawsuit 
calls made by the associated press to the high school and school 
committee offices went unanswered thursday 
a spokeswoman for the jostens yearbook and publishing co in 
minnesota told the newspaper she could not comment on the lawsuit 
but said schools must sign release forms before any yearbooks are 
printed

presidentelect george bush preparing for a 
preinaugural meeting with mexicos incoming president is promising 
to consult with mexican authorities before taking any actions which 
affect that countrys wellbeing 
bush made the pledge thursday in a letter he sent to a panel of 
prominent mexicans and americans who produced a 238page report 
containing a series of recommendations on how to avoid future crises 
in crossborder relations 
the letter also confirmed that bush plans an early meeting with 
mexican presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari who was elected 
in july and will take office on dec 1 they will meet in houston 
next tuesday officials said 
bush said the proximity of the us and mexican presidential 
inaugurations offers tremendous opportunities for the two 
countries to work together 
bushs deputy national security adviser col sam watson 
presented the letter to commission members on receiving a copy of 
the report prepared by the bilateral commission on the future of 
united statesmexican relations 
among other recommendations the report said unilateral measures 
must be avoided on issues affecting the two countries 
bush wrote one hallmark of my administration will be close 
consultations and a bilateral approach to problemsolving your 
report will be of great use in the future the effort was well 
worth it 
mexico has frequently been critical of the united states for 
failing to consult adequately on issues of mutual interest 
commission cochairman hugo b margain a member of the mexican 
senate and a former ambassador to the united states said thursday 
the two countries must abandon reliance on unilateral solutions 
bilateral problems require bilateral solutions he said if 
a problem crosses the border we must search on both sides if we are 
to find a solution that works 
joining margain as commission cochairman was william d rogers 
who held two senior state department posts during the ford 
administration 
before his letter was released by the commission bush seemed 
surprised when asked at a news conference about reports that he 
planned to meet with salinas next week 
since neither side was prepared to announce the meeting bush 
dealt with it only as a hypothetical possibility 
if such a meeting takes place it will symbolize the 
importance of our front yard our neighbors he said adding that 
he has kept in touch with cross border problems in meetings with 
mexican presidents 
the commission report criticized the reagan administrations 
handling of drug problems it said the united states placed 
excessive emphasis on law enforcement to curb drug smuggling and 
that recent increases in funding levels to reduce demand for drugs 
will prove inadequate 
the commission urges the us to give top priority to learning 
how to reduce demand and to allocate sufficient resources to move 
rapidly in attacking this critical problem the report said 
it suggested that the us government subordinated the drug issue 
in its relations with panama and honduras because priority was given 
to security concerns 
such obviously selective application of its international 
narcotics control policy undermines us credibility with other 
countries and with the multilateral institutions pledged to combat 
drug abuse the report said 
the study also covers a number of other contentious issues some 
excerpts 
debt for mexico debt service obligations in the future 
should be designed subject to its capacity to pay under conditions 
of growth without growth adjustment will not be sustained without 
growth resources for debt service will not be available 
trade both countries should continue to agree to generalized 
trade concessions they should move promptly to freetrade 
agreements in all sectors where benefits from free trade may exist 
especially industrial sectors 
migration both governments should undertake to reach a 
bilateral accord on migration which should consider a possible 
increase in the legal quotas of mexican migration to the us and 
an agreement on the flow and treatment of seasonal agricultural 
workers 
foreign policy a first step is to initiate a frank and open 
dialogue on the concept of regional security the commission 
believes that regional security involves not only militarystrategic 
concerns but must also encompass questions of 
socioeconomic development 
other commission members included former world bank president 
robert mcnamara san antonio mayor henry cisneros and colegio de 
mexico president mario ojeda

a japanese soprano yoko watanabe sang the title 
part as the metropolitan opera performed puccinis madama 
butterfly for the first time this season on thursday night 
miss watanabe made her met debut in the same role in 1986 she is 
enormously effective in the part her voice is big but she can make 
it seem small befitting a demure personality she sounded as fresh 
at the end of the opera as at the beginning 
miss watanabes voice isnt emotional or lushly beautiful but she 
delivered the story of love and betrayal by singing the music very 
well she made an affecting madama butterfly the audience responded 
with enthusiastic applause 
myungwhun chung from korea who also made his met debut in 1986 
was conducting this opera for the first time at the met he 
impresses as a sensitive conductor who knows what hes doing 
brenda boozer of atlanta sang suzuki butterflys maid they were 
well cast both slender young women with attractive voices with 
vibrato they blended well sondra kelly who has been singing with 
the connecticut opera made her met debut as kate pinkerton a 
walkon later this season she will sing in die walkuere 
giorgio lamberti has the right kind of focused tenor voice to 
sing us navy lieutenant pinkerton leo nucci of italy sang us 
consul sharpless nuccis voice and deportment seem more impressive 
each time hes heard one paid more attention to sharpless than 
usual as always happens with mediumsize parts when theyre well 
sung fortunately for audiences here nucci is singing in four 
operas at the met this season 
the production dates from 1958 in the old metropolitan opera 
house a couple of makeshift wings which surely could be improved 
on attempt to make it look wide enough for this stage but its 
still two beautiful sets of the garden of butterflys house and the 
interior

lithuanian lawmakers convened to debate a challenge 
to moscows authority and residents of neighboring latvia today 
marked their republics presoviet independence in another 
outpouring of baltic nationalism this week in estonia the third 
soviet baltic republic the parliament declared estonias 
sovereignty in all matters but defense and foreign affairs it 
passed a constitutional amendment requiring estonian approval of any 
new soviet law 
in lithuania hundreds of demonstrators converged thursday on the 
parliament building with banners and flags according to veleya 
terleckiene the demonstrators carried flags of formerly independent 
lithuania and banners supporting lithuanian autonomy said ms 
terleckiene the daughter of anastas terleckas a leader of the 
separatist lithuanian liberty league 
lithuanians watched on live television as their legislators 
convened a session expected to take up a declaration of lithuanian 
as the official language and other laws following estonias example 
alexander gelbaf deputy editor of the official newspaper 
sovietskaya litva said in a telephone interview that the parliament 
took up only budgetary matters thursday he said the constitutional 
questions related to relations with the central government would be 
debated beginning today 
ms terleckiene said the entire republic including members of 
the communist party supported initiatives of the grassroots 
lithuanian peoples front being debated in parliament 
meanwhile in latvia residents planned demonstrations and 
rallies for today the 70th anniversary of the birth of their 
shortlived independent nation 
the three baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia were 
independent countries between the world wars the soviet union 
annexed them in 1940 after a pact with the nazis 
the united states backed the baltic nationalists thursday state 
department spokesman charles redman said in washington the united 
states does not recognize the forcible incorporation of the baltic 
states the people of the baltic states have been denied their 
basic human rights 
it is not yet clear how kremlin authorities will deal with the 
latest outburst of baltic nationalism on thursday they called 
estonian leaders to moscow to discuss wednesdays challenge to 
central control but no date has been set for the meeting 
the kremlin has shown signs of impatience with the baltics 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev believed to be president 
mikhail s gorbachevs closest adviser said in an interview last 
month that the republics will not be allowed to take any major steps 
toward independence 
the estonian parliament made its challenge under the banner of 
the reform effort gorbachev calls perestroika the challenge 
underscores gorbachevs problems with rising ethnic feelings that 
could spread to other areas 
thousands of baltic people have joined grassroots nationalist 
groups some say privately their ultimate goal is secession from the 
soviet union 
baltic nationalists have been angered by amendments to the 
national constitution proposed by gorbachev they say the changes 
would shift the little power they now hold to moscow and eliminate 
their constitutional right to secede

yields on 30year treasury bonds fell in the 
latest auction to the lowest level in nine months 
the average yield thursday was 910 percent down from 917 
percent at the last auction on may 12 
it was the lowest rate since 30year bonds averaged 851 percent 
on feb 4 the bonds will carry a coupon interest rate of 9 percent 
with each 10000 in face value selling for 989700 
a total of 903 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling 
216 billion 
the treasury department normally auctions 30year bonds every 
three months but had to cancel the august sale and postpone the 
november sale for a week because it previously had sold nearly as 
many of the bonds as congress had authorized 
but tax legislation signed by president reagan on nov 11 lifted 
the limits paving the way for thursdays auction

capitol hill lawmakers say john sununu george 
bushs choice as his new chief of staff could be a tough advocate 
for the new president if he listens and learns the ways of 
washington 
house majority whip tony coelho who debated sununu several times 
on television during the campaign found him tough and competent 
firm in his view and he has bushs confidence 
coelho the thirdraking democrat in the house said bushs 
choice nonetheless was a gamble because the guy doesnt know 
washington thats a very important negative 
i think he can do the job he said the key is does he have 
enough personal confidence to surround himself with people who 
know the power centers in washington what makes this city tick 
rep dick cheney of wyoming who is expected to become the house 
republican whip in january said lawmakers understand that sununus 
first job is to do george bushs bidding but he would do well to 
hire a strong experienced liaison with congress 
i think what congress expects more than anything else is 
understanding that we have a legitimate role in the process 
said cheney who served as former president gerald fords chief of 
staff its more a matter of attitude than anything else 
ford before becoming vice president and then president was the 
house republican leader so the staffs congressional experience was 
less important with reagan who had no washington experience 
capitol hill relations rested heavily on aides 
my guess is bush is going to fall somewhere in between said 
cheney noting that bush still has a lot of friends in congress from 
when he served in the house for two terms from 1967 through 1970 
many lawmakers know sununu mostly from his role in the bush 
campaign where the threeterm governor was often leading the 
harshest attacks against the democrats the 49yearold engineer has 
a reputation as a selfassured and somewhat abrasive manager from 
his six years in the new hampshire statehouse 
its a style that could generate friction in the backrubbing 
world of the capitol 
joseph grandmaison the new hampshire democratic party chairman 
said sununu will have to cool down his act 
on a state level he thinks nothing of dressing down 
legislators the first time he tries to do that to a senior member 
of congress hell find his effectiveness tremendously 
impacted grandmaison said 
bush in announcing the appointment on thursday said he was sure 
sununu could build a constructive relationship with congress 
sen j bennett johnston dla who is running for senate 
majority leader said he was like many in congress who will wait and 
see 
he is widely praised outside of washington but brandnew inside 
washington he said 
sen gordon humphrey rnh a sununu ally from his home state 
said he didnt think getting along with congress was the most 
important task for the new chief of staff 
i would advise him to try to transform washington and not be 
conformed to it humphrey said a failing of the reagan 
administration he said was that it was sometimes too obliging 
toward the bureaucracy and the congress 
the appointment of the chief of staff is the presidents it does 
not require the approval of congress if it did sununu certainly 
would take heat over his refusal to join 49 other governors in 
opposing a united nations resolution equating zionism with racism 
because of that stance several jewish organizations have expressed 
concern about sununu whose lebanese father was a boston businessman 
sununu said thursday he felt as governor he should not embroil 
himself in foreign policy issues he added that he took pains to 
make sure the 1988 republican platform included a condemnation of 
the un resolution

a consumer group and the attorney general of 
new york filed a petition asking the government to ban some crib 
toys they said could harm infants 
the petition said at least 49 children had been killed or injured 
by crib toys over the past 15 years 
the request was filed thursday with the consumer product safety 
commission by new york attorney general robert abrams and the 
consumer federation of america which is a coalition of more than 
250 consumer advocacy organizations 
the toys in question are crib gyms mobiles activity boxes 
suspended stuffed toys mirrors music boxes and others marketed for 
use in cribs and playpens 
nothing could be more devastating to a parent than the 
knowledge that a toy purchased to amuse an infant child ended up 
causing that childs death abrams said the numbers over the 
past 15 years indicate a clear need for tougher safety standards if 
we hope to prevent additional tragedies 
the petition asks the consumer product safety agency to determine 
that certain crib toys intended for use by children present a 
mechanical hazard and therefore are banned hazardous substances 
mary ellen fise spokeswoman for the consumer federation of 
america said her organization was recommending that people not buy 
these toys for christmas 
in their petition abrams and the federation cited a 1987 
consumer product safety commission report which found that between 
1973 and 1987 30 deaths one case of severe brain damage and 18 
near misses were caused by crib toys 
some children were strangled by pullcords on the toys while 
others got their clothing caught in protrusions and choked 
according to the petition another child got his hand caught in a 
pull ring and in an effort to disengage it rolled over and hanged 
himself 
the petition also seeks labels to warn consumers to use the toys 
with both ends attached to opposite crib sides six incidents 
including one death have occurred where an unattached end of a crib 
gym wrapped around a childs neck they said 
the commission staff has estimated that based on 1984 data there 
are approximately 350000 crib gyms and 800000 crib mobiles in use 
unfortunately this is another case where the cpsc has decided 
to look the other way and ignore their own inhouse study fise 
said 
dave shiflett a spokesman for the safety commission said the 
agency had received the petition thursday and the staff would review 
it 
if the staff determines it meets our requirements it will be 
docketed and then further studied by the commission he said 
docketing could take as little as 30 days but the entire 
procedure leading up to a decision by the commissioners could take 
as long as two or three years said doug noble another commission 
spokesman

two unions representing the majority of 
organized health care workers in privately owned hospitals and 
nursing homes have agreed to merge 
the 70000 members of the national union of hospital and health 
care employees will be asked in january to approve a plan to merge 
with the 875000member service employees international union both 
unions belong to the aflcio 
theres a need for us to consolidate resources and our ability 
to win strikes too jerome p brown the hospital employees 
unions secretarytreasurer said thursday 
the industry is changing rapidly in terms of chains taking over 
nursing homes and hospitals becoming subsidiaries of holding 
companies in all types of other businesses he said 
with cost containment pressures coming from the government and 
health plan providers the people who are getting it in the neck are 
the workers he said 
seiu president john sweeney said the hospital employees would 
continue as an autonomous national local within his union 
when added to the new bargaining unit rules weve finally pried 
from the nlrb the combined strength we now have means we will have 
the clout to successfully do battle with the giant conglomerates 
gobbling up the hospital industry sweeney said 
the hospital employees with a membership that is more than 50 
percent black or hispanic was the only major union to endorse jesse 
jacksons presidential candidacy this year 
it broke off from the retail wholesale and department store 
union in 1984 and has been seeking a merger partner ever since 
local 1199 of the hospital employees union and its 75000 members 
in new york city voted to remain a part of the retail clerks union 
the merger was announced just seven weeks after the national 
labor relations board issued proposed new regulations that would 
make it much easier for unions to organize hospital workers only 
about 10 percent of the nations health care workers belong to

country music star johnny lee who sang 
looking for love in all the wrong places was looking for 
business in the wrong place when he tried to open a nightclub in 
north alabama a judge ruled 
us district judge william acker of birmingham dismissed a 5 
million lawsuit that lee and a business partner jimmy cornelius of 
guntersville filed against the city of guntersville 
rather than bring this suit plaintiffs perhaps should thank 
the defendants acker said because they kept lee and cornelius 
from spending money to build a nightclub that never could have 
received a liquor license 
lemonade might not have mixed well with hank williams and it is 
doubtful that it would have made the cash register ring acker 
wrote in his decision released this week 
the plaintiffs attorney donald stewart was not immediately 
available for comment thursday on whether he would appeal 
lee who moved to guntersville after singing the hit song from 
the movie urban cowboy wanted to develop a nightclub called 
johnny lee show palace near guntersville liquor sales are legal 
in guntersville but not in the rural parts of marshall county 
in 1986 the guntersville city council annexed land along us 
431 and zoned it to allow businesses to sell liquor for offpremise 
consumption lee and cornelius bought some of the newly annexed 
property and applied for a zoning change that would allow them to 
sell liquor for consumption in a nightclub 
the city council denied the change in april 1987 prompting lees 
attorneys to file suit claiming a loss of property rights 
acker said the alabama supreme court last year ruled long 
lasso annexations such as guntersvilles illegal because of that 
the judge said lee and cornelius never had a property right 
subject to municipal zoning since the property was never legally 
in the city

they were hobos drifting from town to town 
working odd jobs for long hours and low pay before they decided to 
form a union whose goal was to abolish capitalism 
that probably never will happen but after 83 years the 
industrial workers of the world or wobblies continue to tilt at 
windmills and they recently won a victory of sorts here when 
employees of a state peace group voted to organize in a union 
since the continental congress of the working class in 1905 
when the union was founded wobblies have devoted themselves to 
creating one big union for all workers 
despite past government crackdowns and a lack of public sympathy 
that has relegated the union to the status of a labor movement 
curiosity wobblies continue to espouse the virtues of directaction 
such as work stoppages and boycotts 
if everybody absolutely refused to go to work what the hell 
can the government do asked jenny velsek an iww member since 
1921 
the unions national membership is 900 to 1000 a far cry from 
the 100000 members it boasted around world war i but almost double 
the 500 members it had in 1987 said brian myers office manager of 
the unions chicago headquarters and editor of the iww newspaper 
the industrial worker 
we like to say the iww is an organization that has always been 
small but whose influence has far exceeded its numbers said 
myers who is the iwws only paid staffer earning 750 an hour 
the wobblies have organized small pockets of oilfield workers 
loggers printers shipbuilders and grocery clerks in locals from 
toronto to san francisco 
recent iww efforts have focused on the antinuclear movement and 
the unions goal is to organize canvassers nationwide said billy 
don robinson of portland an iww activist in the pacific northwest 
an apt metaphor for the wobblies recent revival is the 
discovery of some of the ashes of joe hill one of the iwws most 
famous leaders 
the ashes were found earlier this year in the national archives 
and will be turned over to the union in a ceremony friday in 
washington dc most of hills ashes were distributed to iww locals 
and scattered on may day 1916 but some were seized in a raid on the 
unions chicago headquarters in 1917 and eventually found their way 
into the archives 
hill immortalized the wobblies in song and poetry before he was 
executed in 1915 the day before he was shot in utah on a charge of 
murdering a grocery owner hill told colleagues dont waste any 
time in mourning organize 
later hills life and death inspired the popular union song that 
begins i dreamed i saw joe hill last night alive as you or me 
national attention first was drawn to the wobblies whose 
nickname was taken from a chinese cook who pronounced iww i wobble 
wobble in 1912 when 25000 textile workers walked off the job 
in lawrence mass 
strikers sent their children to other cities to stay with 
sympathetic families lawrence police tried to block others from 
boarding trains headed out of town 
the ensuing melee in which women and children were injured 
brought such protests from around the country that management gave 
in to the workers demands much of the textile industry followed 
and the iww chalked up what has been called its greatest triumph 
today the unions reputation for activism remains intact with 
just a few members in each city wobblies have been arrested in 
colorado and nevada for protesting nuclear testing and in los 
angeles for demonstrating against arms shipments to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
one of the unions biggest victories recently has come in 
portland where seven canvassers from the antinuclear group oregon 
sane last month voted unanimously to join the iww they have not 
negotiated a contract yet 
the canvassers who raise funds and educate the public about the 
groups goals decided to organize to fight for higher pay and more 
say in the organizations decisionmaking process 
sane workers say they didnt want to join a more mainstream union 
because they didnt feel they would have a large enough say in how 
they would operate the wobblies dues 2 a month also was a 
factor

mulroneys responses to president reagans requests 
yes sir mr president turner replies submissively to each 
point with a crisp salute he charges the prime minister wants to be 
governor of the 51st state 
mulroney resorts to sarcasm as well in his increasingly biting 
attacks describing a potential meeting next year if his rival 
becomes prime minister 
imagine mr turner going to washington to say hey president 
bush i just tore up the freetrade accord and now if you have 15 
minutes well negotiate an acidrain treaty 
you know what the president would say mulroney asks hed 
say exactly what your motherinlaw would say hey this guy cant 
be serious 
canada claims half the acid rain falling in eastern canada 
originates in the united states making it one of the most 
troublesome issues between the two countries 
the free trade agreement has been approved by the us congress 
but needs final canadian parliamentary approval the socialist new 
democratic party led by ed broadbent also opposes the deal so only 
a conservative majority victory ensures the agreement will start 
taking effect jan 1 as scheduled 
the relationship with washington attracted special attention 
thursday because of reagans speech on international trade in 
washington in which he spoke favorably of the canadian agreement 
as far as the united states is concerned the free trade 
agreement is an example of cooperation at its best it is a 
testament to the commitment of our two governments to the principles 
of the open market and to economic cooperation reagan said 
turner immediately described the speech as intervention in 
canadian affairs 
as a canadian and with no antiamerican sentiment at all i 
resent the intervention into our election the liberal leader said 
during a campaign stop in quebec 
turner also said the speech was very similar to language used by 
mulroney adding that such phrases could have been written by mr 
mulroney and perhaps they were 
the conservatives have denied reports they sought any support or 
extra assurances on the agreement from washington to calm down 
canadian opposition to the pact 
broadbent whose party is expected to finish third with a key 
position of influence if the conservatives or liberals fail to win a 
majority said reagans speech could harm mulroneys chances 
it will remind every canadian how close brian mulroney is to 
ronald reagan broadbent said on a campaign stop in edmonton 
alberta it will remind every canadian the americans got virtually 
everything they wanted in this deal 
the canadian press news agency said in its report from washington 
on the speech that reagan offered passing praise for the deal 
keeping his remarks as innocuous as possible in a bid to avoid 
accusations of trying to influence the outcome of mondays canadian 
election 
us officials have not said whether any retaliation is planned 
if canada decides against the agreement the two nations already are 
each others largest trading partner with the 150 billion passing 
between them each year making it the worlds largest trading 
partnership

women can talk more fluently and move their hands 
more skillfully when their sex hormones are at high levels 
according to a study believed to be the first linking human 
performance to sex hormones 
the research on 200 women during their menstrual cycle and 
postmenopausal women on estrogenreplacement therary is by doreen 
kimura of the university of western ontario in london ontario 
it shows women perform significantly better in verbal fluency and 
finemotor muscular control when their estrogen and progesterone 
levels are high 
kimuras study also showed that womens ability to perform 
spatial tasks is enhanced by lower hormone levels 
the researcher said similar patterns probably occur in men whose 
sex hormone testosterone fluctuates daily 
kimura who spoke wednesday at a news briefing during the annual 
meeting of the society for neuroscience compared womens spatial 
cognition and verbal and motor abilities during times of peak and 
low hormone levels 
the levels rise and fall during the course of a womans menstrual 
cycle the peak estrogen phase begins just before ovulation and 
extends until a week to 10 days before menstruation a drop in 
hormone levels occurs during menstruation 
spatial tasks that kimura tested involved identifying a shape in 
a complex pattern tonguetwisters tested verbal skills and 
finemotor tasks included rapid changing of hand postures 
men generally do better on such spatial problems but women on 
average score better on the verbal and finemotor tasks 
in the lowhormone phase it might take a woman three seconds 
longer to repeat a tonguetwister correctly than during her peak 
level the researcher said 
with motortasks women say gosh im really clumsy this 
week said kimura 
she said her study supports the idea that malefemale cognitive 
differences are influenced by sex hormones acting on the brain she 
said she is now studying how mens abilities might vary according to 
the level of testosterone 
its easier to identify these things in women but my guess is 
they can happen also in males said kimura 
she acknowledged that the study suggests there may be optimal 
times for women to perform certain tasks such as taking 
standardized academic examinations 
we really dont know enough yet she said it may be in a 
couple of years well know enough about it to say there are 
significant enough effects that these can be factors in test scores 
and performance 
kimura stressed that abilities vary greatly among individual men 
and women with some women better at tasks in which men generally 
excel 
theres an enormous overlap in the ability patterns between men 
and women she said

a b1b bomber crashed near ellsworth air 
force base in western south dakota the second accident involving 
the longrange strategic jet in two weeks authorities said early 
friday 
the b1b crashed on the runway as it came in for a landing at 
about 130 am est officials said there was no immediate word on 
the extent of injuries to the crew 
from monitoring the ambulance traffic they say they were going 
to ellsworth base hospital with four or five patients we dont know 
if theyre dead or alive said lt fred brown of the rapid city 
police department 
however navy lt cmdr james kudla a spokesman for the defense 
department in washington said right now at least it looks like 
there were no fatalities 
the crash comes two days after officials reported that the air 
force had inspected and cleared more than twothirds of the b1b 
bombers grounded following a crash last week that destroyed one of 
the longrange planes in texas 
brown said the b1b crashed on the runway as it came in for a 
landing at ellsworth which lies on the eastern edge of rapid city 
he said it did not hit any buildings and no one on the ground was 
known to be injured 
witnesses saw four people eject from the airplane before it 
crashed brown said it is possible that it came in too low and 
hit a power pole 
ellsworth has told us it was carrying a sixman crew he 
said adding that the jet normally carried four 
witnesses reported a downed power line and airplane parts 
scattered in the landing area he said power was reported out in 
box elder a town south of the base 
on nov 8 a b1b crashed and burned in a field near dyess air 
force base texas it had been the second accident to claim one of 
the new bombers in 14 months in that crash the crew of four 
managed to eject and survived 
that crash was the third in four years since b1 aircraft began 
flying as the nations first new longrange bomber in more than 25 
years 
strategic air command spokesman lt col george h peck said 
tuesday that 63 of the 85 b1bs located at sac bases had been 
inspected as of tuesday without any problems being detected 
the air force has refused to speculate on the cause of the texas 
crash although a fire had been observed by witnesses around the 
planes left two engines before the crash sacs grounding order 
specified a mandatory inspection of electric fuel and hydraulic 
fluid lines 
in addition to ellsworth and dyess the bombers also have been 
deployed to grand forks afb nd and mcconnell afb kan 
the air force has been criticized over the past two years for its 
handling of the b1b program primarily because of acknowledged 
problems in developing the bombers radarjamming gear however the 
service insists the plane is the best longrange bomber in the world

a study that found seventhday adventists can 
expect to live longer suggests that others who adopt the healthful 
lifestyle of the religious group may also extend their life spans 
the seventhday adventists strict approach to diet exercise 
weight and smoking showed significant association with life 
expectancy said jan w kuzma a professor of vital statistics at 
loma linda university in california 
what we choose to do makes a big difference on how long we 
live kuzma said 
practicing seventhday adventists abstain from smoking and 
drinking alcoholic beverages and many adopt a vegetarian or 
nearvegetarian diet 
this group has unique health practices and since these are so 
highly associated with favorable outcomes it points to the fact 
that what a person chooses to do by not smoking by not overeating 
and by exercising affects life expectancies said kuzma who 
presented his study thursday at the american public health 
associations annual meeting 
kuzma found that a 35yearold male seventhday adventist was 
likely to live to be 82 nine more years than the average california 
white male for females the advantage was 76 years longer 
the study calculated life tables for a group of 27514 
seventhday adventists 9804 males and 17710 females older than 
age 30 who enrolled in a study in 1960 kuzma followed up on that 
study through 1985 by checking california death records 
life expectancies for the seventhday adventists were compared to 
figures for the general california population 
kuzmas findings prompted differing reactions from other 
researchers 
dr leonard hayflick a professor of biogerontology at the 
university of california san francisco said he generally is 
skeptical of claims that lifestyle factors rather than genetics can 
affect longevity 
if you talk to elderly people and look at their lifestyle 
youll find nothing in common one of the few correlations is the 
age of death of their six parents or grandparents that correlates 
pretty good with life expectations he said theres nothing in 
lifestyle that will increase life expectation 
but dr dean ornish also at ucsf who has studied preventive 
medicine and the effect of lifestyle on heart disease said kuzmas 
findings dont appear to conflict with other research 
i think this is an important study because it adds increasing 
evidence that choices that we make as individuals in our lifestyle 
are perhaps the most important and powerful determinant of our 
health and longevity ornish said 
in making comparisons kuzma cautioned that the seventhday 
adventist population was a controlled group that decreased since 
1960 because of deaths while the general california population 
although matched by age and sex was continually changing 
but he said he is confident that the longer life expectancies of 
seventhday adventists can be attributed to their healthy lifestyles 
the seventhday adventist church is a religious denomination 
based on the belief that the second coming of jesus christ is near 
the term seventhday derives from the groups contention that the 
bible requires observing the sabbath on saturday the seventh day of 
the week loma linda university is affiliated with the church

the nuclear regulatory commission says a key 
financial issue has been resolved and should no longer be an 
obstacle to granting a lowpower operating license for the seabrook 
nh nuclear plant 
the commission ordered seabrooks owners in september to 
provide reasonable assurance that adequate funds are 
available to decommission the plant if the nrc issues a 5 percent 
power testing license but eventually refuses to grant a fullpower 
commercial license 
the request came because of unique and unusual circumstances 
surrounding the financial status of seabrook public service company 
of new hampshire the plants lead owner in january became the 
first major electric utility to file for bankruptcy protection since 
the depression 
in a report made available thursday nrc staff counsel gregory 
alan berry said the owners decommissioning plan submitted last 
month was adequate and recommended that the commissioners remove 
that regulatory obstacle one of just two remaining in seabrooks 
quest for a testing license 
the plan provides reasonable assurance that funds would be 
available to decommission seabrook station after lowpower operation 
if a fullpower authorization is not granted berry wrote ample 
funds are available 
the other remaining issue whether the plant is financially 
qualified to run the reactor also is pending

the immigration appeals board has ruled that 
joseph doherty of the irish republican army wanted for the killing 
of a british soldier should be allowed to proceed with legal 
efforts to avoid deportation from the united states 
dohertys attorney mary pike received a copy of the opinion 
thursday the board had made its decision monday 
under the 32 ruling doherty is entitled to a hearing before an 
immigration judge where he could present claims for political asylum 
and withholding of deportation doherty would have to show a 
wellfounded fear of persecution to substantiate an asylum claim 
on june 14 thenattorney general edwin meese iii refused a 
request by doherty to be deported to ireland instead of to britain 
that order was appealed 
the government may appeal the latest ruling to attorney general 
dick thornburgh 
doherty has been held in a federal jail the metropolitan 
correctional center in lower manhattan for five years while courts 
weighed whether the slaying was a political act for which he could 
not be extradited to britain 
doherty was convicted in 1981 of killing a british army captain 
in an ambush on a british convoy in belfast in the closing days of 
his trial mr doherty escaped from a prison in northern ireland and 
fled to the united states where he was arrested in 1983

the summer drought is not over for the nations 
waterways according to government scientists 
a report released thursday showed that nearly 40 percent of 
streams in the lower 48 states had belownormal flow during october 
when will the drought be over i dont know tom ross 
supervisory hydrologist at the us geological survey said in a 
statement 
precipitation was well above average in september in much of the 
country and above average in the east in october ross said 
precipitation through february in mountain areas and through the 
spring in the southeast would determine whether flow moved closer to 
normal 
monitoring stations on 53 percent of western streams reported 
belownormal october flow fortysix percent of great lakes streams 
were below normal but only 28 percent of those in the northeast 
the big three rivers the columbia mississippi and st 
lawrence averaged a combined 324 billion gallons per day 22 
percent below normal but well above the record low of 257 billion

the census bureau says state and local 
government reliance on federal aid last year sank to its lowest 
level in more than 20 years 
from a high of 187 cents per dollar of state and local 
government revenue in 1978 the federal contribution withered to 
136 cents in 1987 it was the lowest since 1966 when lyndon 
johnson was gearing up the great society programs and the federal 
contribution was 135 cents per dollar 
total federal aid actually has risen throughout the period from 
70 billion in 1978 to 113 billion in 1986 to 115 billion in 
1987 but it is increasing at a slower rate than other state and 
local government revenues 
while the federal contribution grew at an average of 57 percent 
a year from 1978 to 1987 the amount raised by state and local taxes 
grew an average of 85 percent a year 
last year state and local taxes grew 86 percent to 4051 
billion while federal aid increased only 17 percent revenue from 
all sources totaled 8426 billion 
henry wulf a census bureau analyst said the federal share 
likely will slip again in future years because state and local 
governments will be increasing spending to upgrade 
infrastructure items such as sewers and roads

attorneys for a landlady suspected of 
killing seven tenants for their social security checks accused the 
media and police of turning the case into a circus 
public defenders peter vlautin and kevin clymo criticized the 
sacramento police department for transporting dorothea montalvo 
puente from los angeles to sacramento in a jet chartered by a 
television station and allowing a reporter to interview her 
its unheard of that a law enforcement agency would team up 
with a news organization to transport a person to jail vlautin 
said 
bill george assignment editor for the station kcratv in 
sacramento said thursday night that the reporter mike boyd was 
only doing a good job 
he was just being an aggressive journalist said george 
no deal was made with police they needed a way to get back to 
sacramento and we offered one 
george added that there were no commercial flights at the time 
puente 59 who vanished early saturday after police unearthed 
the first of seven bodies buried in her yard was arrested in los 
angeles late wednesday she appeared briefly thursday in municipal 
court here but did not enter a plea to a single murder count 
assistant district attorney dan kinter told the judge that 
additional counts and special circumstances would be filed special 
circumstances means the penalty upon conviction could be death or 
life in prison without parole 
puente was ordered held without bail vlautin and clymo were 
appointed to represent her and the case was continued to dec 15 
police have not identified any of the bodies but have a list of 
25 people mostly impoverished elderly people on social security 
who have lived at puentes eightbedroom rooming house and whose 
whereabouts are unknown 
during the television interview puente denied any involvement in 
the deaths 
i have not killed anyone puente said on the plane i told 
you that i have not killed anyone the checks i cashed yes 
the reporter said he didnt ask her about the murders and she 
volunteered her denial she also told him i used to be a very 
good person at one time 
puente has a criminal record dating to a 1948 conviction for 
forging checks she served 2 years in prison in the 1980s for 
drugging and robbing three men she met in a bar and remains on 
parole for a separate federal forgery conviction 
her attorneys said they were infuriated that puente was 
interviewed without a lawyer being present 
puente was put on the jet with detectives and the television crew 
with no opportunity to talk to anybody who had her interests in 
mind said clymo 
our client denies killing anybody the true facts will come out 
in the courtroom said vlautin the sacramento police department 
has enlisted the aid of the media to create a circus atmosphere 
police chief john kearns said at a news conference he did not 
learn about the jet arrangements until thursday morning the plane 
arrived in sacramento just before 5 am 
the matter is being looked into at the present time he said 
kearns said police did not have enough evidence to arrest puente 
after the first body was found but he admitted investigators erred 
in not following her she apparently boarded a bus for los angeles 
kearns said 
she checked into a downtown motel there using the name of donna 
johanson police said at a nearby bar she met charles willgues a 
67yearold pensioner 
willgues said he became suspicious after puente quizzed him about 
his social security benefits willgues who receives social security 
and other disability benefits said puente asked him where he got 
his money and then suggested that they share an apartment 
she seemed nice and sincere i found her very believable he 
said 
but her face seemed familiar and he remembered seeing her on a 
morning newscast on cbs he called the networks bureau and 
eventually went there and identified a photo of puente police were 
notified and puente was arrested at her motel 
kearns said police would attempt to identify the bodies and would 
look at puentes bank accounts at least one of the missing tenants 
had designated puente as payee of his pension checks 
several organizations had sent people to live at puentes home 
over the years which she rented from the owners police went to the 
house a week ago when one social worker complained that she had not 
seen one of the men since august 
that man alvaro montoya a 52yearold mentally disabled person 
is the one puente is accused of killing

residents of this pristine island town 
are luring city dwellers with offers of lowcost land and homes in 
an attempt to stop frenchboro from becoming just another tourist 
spot along maines scenic coast 
sanford lunt his family and their neighbors developed the 
homestead plan after years of watching residents forsake the island 
for the mainland 
the first homesteaders arrived recently and by christmas the 
rest are expected to be living on the island most of which is owned 
by the heirs of nelson rockefeller 
these people are great said steve beote a 27yearold 
electrician who moved from salem mass you dont find people like 
this in massachusetts anymore 
beotes and six other families were chosen from about 300 
applicants to move onto the 2500acre island officially called 
long island across blue hill bay from the mainland 
between 1960 and 1980 frenchboros population dropped from 57 to 
43 as young residents left for the mainland and older residents died 
about the same time vacationers discovered the island with its 
clear accommodating harbor and proximity to the popular resort town 
of bar harbor 25 miles away by boat 
the islands attractiveness concerned residents who prefer a 
relaxed life without distractions from the outside world said lunt 
78 the islands oldest resident 
were getting down in population and if it gets down too far 
it might be all summer people lunt said with bent nails 
protruding from his mouth as he repaired a lobster trap we dont 
want that to happen 
a twiceaweek ferry that takes 40 minutes connects the mainland 
with the island which has no doctors yearround stores public 
telephones or traffic lights 
islanders say life has a special meaning here and as if to prove 
the point they feed plump wild deer by hand and ducks and geese 
outside their doorsteps 
its a good place its quiet and you dont have to worry about 
anyone breaking in on you at night said lunt 
the homesteaders who have already arrived have been helping to 
build their own houses in thick pine woodland about a halfmile 
from the atlantic ocean the rest of the town faces the harbor 
where lobstermen sell their catch to a wholesale lobster pound 
the seven homestead families are renting the newly built homes 
for three years and later will purchase them at belowmarket 
prices the homes are scattered among about 55 acres of land donated 
by wealthy heirs of rockefeller the late vice president the 
construction was paid for with 400000 in federal community 
development money 
walter pietrowski who moved to the island a few months ago said 
frenchboro offers a tranquility he never found amid the hustle and 
bustle of new haven conn where he his wife and three children 
lived 
sometimes you sit and you just dont hear anything said 
pietrowski its strange but i like it 
pietrowski and the other homesteaders were awarded their land and 
homes after a selection and screening process by a panel of 
islanders and state officials 
most of the homesteaders have young families and the men have 
worked in trades as carpentry and and pipe fitting 
kerry hartman hired to educate the islands seven elementary 
schoolchildren in its oneroom schoolhouse said that what attracted 
him to frenchboro among other things was the harbor which is 
littered only with lobster buoys 
its like having arcadia national park in your back yard 
except theres no tourists said hartman a 26yearold bar harbor 
transplant the national park comprises most of the island on which 
bar harbor is located 
much of the credit for saving the island goes to the lunts whose 
ancestors settled here in 1822 the family which makes up half the 
islands population was the impetus behind the homesteading 
project and have made sure all the newcomers are warmly welcomed 
its more a family than it is a town said warren pard 
higgins an island lobsterman everybody helps everybody out 
whenever theres a problem

in japan rice is everything from a staple food to a 
cultural constant a matter of national security a base of 
religious faith besides the paddy dikes help control floods 
but for stephen gabbert president of the us rice millers 
association japans rice policy is a fantastic example of 
economic distortion and it basically stinks 
on thursday he denounced what he called japans mythology of 
rice and said detroit could just as well have raised the 
automobile as a sacrosanct aspect of american society to stop japan 
from selling cars in the united states 
we shouldnt have any sacred or cultural cows in trade 
relationships he said at a news conference with foreign 
journalists these kinds of sensitivities should not be reasons 
for avoiding confronting trade issues 
gabbert accused japans agricultural cooperatives of being an 
evil empire of raising hysteria and shock and of 
misrepresenting his case for a modest opening of the market 
he said japan could start easing some of its social problems 
such as high land housing and food prices by liberalizing its 
heavilycontrolled rice market 
such salvos have a hard time penetrating the wall japan has 
erected around its rice market in september the diet or 
parliament passed a resolution calling rice production a major 
matter of concern for all japanese as the basis of maintaining and 
developing a sound society in our country 
the resolution firmly rejected us calls to rescind the 
countrys ban on rice imports 
the us association proposes that 25 percent of the market be 
opened to imports annually for four years us producers with 25 
percent of their fields now idle could not take more than 10 
percent of japans market he said valuing the us stake at 300 
million a year 
he said the us rice crop was 6 million to 7 million metric tons 
a year japans harvest was 107 million metric tons in 1987 but is 
expected to fall to 991 million metric tons this year because of a 
cool and rainy summer 
if japan opened its market he said urban rice paddies could be 
used for housing alleviating the high price of homes and perhaps 
letting more people live closer to work and reduce the agony of 
commuting 
rice farmers have inordinate political power he said and 
opening the market would give urbanites their rightful strength 
gabbert said japans ricebased system leads to artificially high 
food prices costing consumers 60 billion a year if some of that 
cash could be spent on manufactured imports it would cut japans 
troublesome trade surplus 
international farming statistics show the average price of rice 
here is 175 a pound compared with 45 cents a pound for us 
consumers 
japanese farmers tend to stay with rice because the government 
buys their production at a guaranteed price while other crop prices 
fluctuate with the market 
in their defense the japanese say the government lowered the 
control price 59 percent last year the price differential is 
largely the result of the recent fall of the dollar they say 
on his 20th visit to japan in 15 years gabbert said he was 
examining the options as his association decides when to refile its 
petition accusing japan of an illegal trade barrier 
president reagans administration decided in late october not to 
accept the last petition but warned that japan must be 
accommodating in trade negotiations starting dec 5 in montreal 
otherwise washington may change its mind 
gabbert said his association may advance the issue after the 
inauguration of presidentelect george bush who said during the 
campaign he favored pressing japan to open its rice market 
it would be a tough decision for bush for tokyo has warned there 
will be a very violent reaction in the words of deputy foreign 
minister michihiko kunihiro if washington starts a sort of 
prosecution

millions of americans who suffer from depression 
may benefit from new research linking the mood disorder in 
alzheimers patients to deterioration in certain areas of the brain 
a doctor says 
researchers said thursday that depression in alzheimers 
sufferers may be caused by deterioration in parts of the brain that 
produce chemicals believed to keep people upbeat 
one of the researchers dr george s zubenko director of 
geriatric health services at western psychiatric institute and 
clinic in pittsburgh suggested that the findings could help 
research into depression in general 
our study makes a suggestion of where in the brain 
investigators or researchers may look for more subtle changes that 
are probably associated with typical forms of depression in younger 
patients who arent demented he said 
theories about depression center on the belief it is caused by 
low activity of chemical messengers in the brain called 
neurotransmitters they permit nerve cells to communicate with each 
other and are believed to be key in maintaining normal levels of 
optimism energy appetite sound sleep and interest in pleasurable 
activities 
about 30 percent of alzheimers patients suffer symptoms of 
depression but contrary to popular belief depression is not a 
normal accompaniment to alzheimers said dr jacob h fox 
director of the rush alzheimers disease center in chicago 
still hundreds of thousands of the estimated 25 million people 
with alzheimers must cope with the burden of being depressed in 
addition to their progressive loss of memory judgment and mobility 
to explore what might be causing their depression the 
pennsylvania researchers performed autopsies on the brains of 37 
patients with dementia or loss of mental function most were 
alzheimers victims including 14 who also were diagnosed with major 
depression 
for comparison the researchers studied brain tissue from seven 
nondemented elderly patients 
the depressed subjects showed significantly more evidence of 
deterioration in two areas of the brain stem than the nondepressed 
subjects the researchers found 
these parts of the brain produce two neurotransmitters believed 
to be important in keeping people free of depression one of the 
neurotransmitters is norepinephrine which is involved in mood and 
sleep cycles and the other dopamine which is involved in physical 
movement and in thinking and mood 
the researchers concluded that abnormalities in the 
neurotransmitter system may give rise to the depression in demented 
patients 
alzheimers accounts for about 60 percent of us cases of 
dementia multiple small strokes account for another 10 percent a 
combination of the two another 10 percent and the remaining 20 
percent have a hodgepodge of causes fox said 
he said the pennsylvania findings confirm work done before but 
the newer study represents a large number of patients and 
careful and convincing work the findings were reported in 
the november issue of the archives of neurology a publication of 
the chicagobased american medical association

a group representing millions of jews in north 
america plans to fight the who is a jew amendment proposed in 
israel but will try to prevent the dispute from affecting 
fundraising for jewish causes the groups leaders say 
if in a family mistakes are made we do not punish said 
shoshana s cardin immediate past president of the council of 
jewish federations 
the councils 3000member general assembly meeting here voted 
thursday to adopt a resolution calling on political factions in 
israel to take the question of who is a jew out of political 
bargaining 
the issue with its ideological moral and communal 
implications should not be decided in the context of political 
accommodation of or ensuring the maintenance or downfall of a 
particular government world jewry should not be divided by a 
political approach to the issue of who is a jew said a 
resolution adopted by voice vote one voice dissented 
the council which says it represents 95 percent of the 55 
million to 6 million jews in the united states and canada will send 
a mission to israel to lobby against the proposal encourage member 
federations to do the same and sponsor a petition drive 
but it also will urge people to continue giving to fundraising 
campaigns which spokesman frank strauss said are expected to raise 
850 million this year to support jews in the united states canada 
and overseas 
such support and contributions are for needs of the people of 
israel not any government of the moment and those needs have not 
lessened they have increased said a resolution adopted thursday 
religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in israels 
elections nov 1 and probably will hold the balance of power in a 
coalition government being formed by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
of the rightwind likud bloc 
in exchange for ultraorthodox support shamir promised to back 
legislation under which only orthodox rabbis could approve 
conversions to judaism it would take the form of an amendment to 
the law of return which gives israeli citizenship to any jew who 
seeks it 
current law defines a jew as anyone born to a jewish mother or 
converted to judaism the proposed change would add in accordance 
with halacha or jewish religious law thereby nullifying 
conversions performed by reform and conservative rabbis who dont 
strictly observe such requirements 
that might apply directly to only a few people each year but 
would divide all jews said council leaders 
we are dealing with a perceived disenfranchisement of millions 
of american jews who will feel they have been written out said 
cardin 
american jews for the most part belong to the reform or 
conservative movements of judaism 
she said north american jews have a right to speak out and be 
heard on the question both because of the role jews around the world 
had in israels formation and because they are part of klal 
israel or jewish unity 
as a religious issue she said it shouldnt be before the 
knesset the israeli parliament she said the group also opposed 
extending the authority of rabbinic courts which settle questions 
of marriage and divorce to include the question of who is a jew 
strauss said the mission to israel will leave sunday he said it 
will be made up of representatives of the council of jewish 
federations the united jewish appeal united israel appeal united 
israel appeal of canada and karen hayesod the fundraising 
organization outside the united states

kentucky has the highest rate of smokingrelated 
deaths in the united states and utah the lowest federal researchers 
say 
the us centers for disease control report thursday came on the 
same day as the great american smokeout the american cancer 
societys yearly attempt to persuade smokers to give up the habit 
even if just for a day 
the cdc reported that kentucky had 176 smokingrelated deaths for 
every 100000 residents in 1985 west virginia was next with 172 
utah had 45 such deaths for every 100000 people 
nationwide smokingrelated diseases killed 314574 americans 
that year 
the worst states after kentucky and west virginia were 
arkansas with 164 smokingrelated deaths per 100000 people in 
1985 rhode island 164 and florida 161 
best on the list after utah alaska 54 hawaii 77 new mexico 
85 and colorado 94 
the report is based on computer analysis of statistics from 1985 
the latest cdc data available 
even though the statebystate totals are not adjusted for age 
to compensate for areas with more older or younger people the 
rates provide valid ballpark comparisons said dr thomas 
novotny a specialist in the cdcs office of smoking and health 
for instance it stands to reason that utah with its large 
mormon population that abstains from using tobacco would have a 
lower rate of death from smoking than other states he said 
the report itself gave no possible explanations for the differing 
death rates 
the cdc estimates the smoking deaths through a mathematical 
formula counting deaths from diseases that can be caused by smoking 
and factoring in the prevalence of smoking in that particular state 
although there might be cases not easily pinpointed a 
chainsmoking kentucky coal miner for example the 
tobaccorelated illnesses far outweigh the risk of other 
exposures novotny said these other things are not something 
that we think will complicate the calculations enough to make them 
invalid 
even as smoking prevalence declines in this country the cdc 
said smokingattributable illness will continue to produce an 
enormous disease burden well into the 21st century 
about 27 percent of the nations adults are smokers according to 
the latest national estimate four decades ago it was 41 percent 
we still have a lot of work to do to prevent people from dying 
from smokingrelated illnesses novotny said 
smoking causes lung cancer heart disease and respiratory 
disease the surgeon general has warned of both the potentially 
fatal risks of smoking and the addictive properties of nicotine the 
active drug in cigarettes 
the cdc also examined the effects of smoking in causing premature 
death the agency calculated years of potential life lost or 
how far short of ones life expectancy a smoker dies us life 
expectancy is about 72 years depending on variables such as sex and 
race 
on average smoking deaths resulted in about 72 years of 
potential life not lived among every 100 americans in 1985 
most smoking deaths novotny said occur in people over age 65 
chronic lung disease goes on for a long time he said you may 
be alive for 20 years with it but that doesnt mean youre not 
sick

youngsters were bawling and screaming some 
were fighting pulling away from their elders some had gotten 
potion shot to the back of their throats with syringes where the 
swallowing reflex would bring it home parents and grandparents 
cried hysterically as their children died not quickly and not 
painlessly the doomed convulsed and gagged as the poison took 
effect from tim reitermans book raven the untold story of 
the rev jim jones and his people 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
three charred poles rising from a 
thicket are all that remain of the jungle pavilion where the rev 
jim jones led more than 900 americans to their death in a macabre 
ritual 10 years ago 
the jonestown suicidemassacre still haunts this impoverished 
land of 780000 on the northern coast of south america and its 
image abroad may be permanently tainted by one of historys most 
bizarre disasters 
once you leave the shores of guyana thats the first thing you 
have to face said alice thomas an editor for the independent 
newspaper stabroek news guyana and jonestown go together 
many guyanese regard jones san franciscobased peoples temple as 
an american aberration that had nothing to do with guyana other than 
its location successive governments have disassociated themselves 
from the affair 
its really hard for us to explain what motivated 900 americans 
to take their lives said patrick denny a government spokesman 
if the media didnt show any interest we wouldnt have remembered 
that it was 10 years since the tragedy 
but capt gerry gouviea 32 clearly recalls the carnage wrought 
by jones on nov 18 1978 when the cult leader urged his disciples 
to drink grapeflavored punch laced with potassium cyanide most 
were poisoned some forcibly some were shot by security guards 
in all 913 people including jones died he was found with a 
bullet wound in the head it is is not known whether he was shot or 
committed suicide 
a second lieutenant in guyanas air force at the time gouviea 
went in a few days later to help recover bodies for burial in the 
united states most lay at the roofed pavilion where jones held 
communal meetings and twicemonthly suicide drills known as white 
nights 
the magnitude of the thing was so great that you were hoping it 
was going to just rewind like a video and everybody was going to 
get up and everything was going to be all right gouviea said 
i remember looking at the children and feeling pity and 
wondering who were the adults who did this thing 
the massacre occurred hours after rep leo ryan dcalif three 
newsmen and a temple defector were shot to death in an ambush at 
nearby port kaituma airstrip eleven people including richard 
dwyer a us diplomat in guyana were wounded 
ryan had flown to guyana to investigate reports that jones was 
abusing his followers 
jonestown ranged over 300 acres carved from dense tropical rain 
forest 140 miles from georgetown the capital dozens of cottages 
workshops and dormitories sat in tidy rows 
pursuing the ideals of socialism and racial harmony jones and 
his 950 or so disciples 70 percent of them black 25 percent white 
and the rest mulatto hispanic american indian and asian 
cultivated a citrus grove and vegetable garden raised chickens and 
pigs made their own shoes educated their children and cared for 
the old and sick 
now jonestown has all but vanished stripped by villagers and 
consumed by a fire a few years ago 
the site is littered with artifacts a rusted filing cabinet 
where jones house used to be a small organ a truck crane and 
trailer lime orange and grapefruit trees still bearing fruit 
maj gen norman mclean head of guyanas armed forces said the 
army occupied the former commune in 1981 and tried to keep it going 
as an agriculture cooperative with 200 sheep 
but superstitious villagers refused to work there he said 
just the thought of 900 people out there and everybody dying 
its horrifying the general said that smell lingered for more 
than a year the smell of death 
eventually the army abandoned the site to the jungle 
under pressure from allegations of misconduct jones moved most 
of his peoples temple from san francisco to guyana the only 
englishspeaking country in south america in 1977 the cult leader 
was obsessed with fear of nuclear was and believed guyana would be 
safe 
he also believed he would be safe from what he perceived as media 
and police persecution 
it was convenient for the late socialist president forbes burnham 
to allow the americans to settle in a region claimed by neighboring 
venezuela said the rev andrew morrison editor of guyanas 
catholic standard newspaper 
morrison who has compiled extensive files on the jonestown 
affair said jones gave burnham financial and political support 
they came and joined in may day parades and that sort of 
thing he said 
larry layton the only temple member charged in connection with 
ryans killing was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987 he was 
convicted by a federal court in san francisco of conspiracy aiding 
and abetting in ryans death and attempted murder in the wounding 
of dwyer 
in handing down the sentence chief us district judge robert 
peckham made layton eligible for parole in 1991 saying a just 
sentence requires consideration of the environment in which layton 
and other members were virtually imprisoned 
a guyanese court convicted another temple member chuck beikman 
in 1979 for his role in the throat slashings of cult spokeswoman 
sharon amos and her three children but he was deported after 
serving nine months the same court acquitted layton on a 
technicality

the ptl ministry is on the auction block 
again after a federal bankruptcy judge rejected two offers and 
threatened to liquidate the evangelical empire if a sale is not 
completed by dec 13 
were not losing sight of the promised land said sam 
johnson president of heritage ministries at ptl responding to 
thursdays decision by judge rufus reynolds to reopen bidding on the 
ministrys assets 
thursdays auction was expected to close the books on the 
ministry that jim and tammy bakker built before a sexandmoney 
scandal forced it to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its 
creditors 
reynolds said the offers presented by the only two qualified 
bidders canadian businessmen stephen mernick and peter thomas 
failed to meet the earlier financial conditions he set 
as a result he scheduled another auction dec 12 and said he 
would convene court the following day to hear its results and decide 
on a sale of the 1700 acres satellite television ministry and 
heritage usa theme park at the fort millbased ministry 
reynolds said if negotiations failed he would close the doors 
and sell off the ministry 
its either then or nothing reynolds told a packed federal 
courtroom 
reynolds had set thursday as the deadline for wrapping up a 
sevenmonth effort to arrange a sale of the assets 
but the 115 million bid by mernick a 34yearold rabbi and 
businessman from toronto did not provide adequate assurances that 
the remaining 65 million would be paid after an initial 50 million 
down payment reynolds said 
and thomass 70 million cash bid allowed him to walk away from 
the deal for up to 30 days a violation of reynoldss conditions 
thomas a 50yearold real estate magnate from vancouver makes his 
bids through the samoth capital corp which he controls 
reynolds said hed decided to turn all of them down and to 
start from scratch 
both mernick and thomas were at the courthouse thursday and said 
afterward that they would consider their alternatives before 
deciding whether to continue bidding 
bidding will begin at 50 million to 60 million ptl trustee 
mc red benton said the bidding will follow reynolds 
conditions which forbid contracts allowing buyers to walk away from 
the deal within a specified period of time and require a 5 percent 
down payment among other things 
benton said he expected one to two additional bidders based on 
the interest in the property 
ptl filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in june 1987 
three months after jim bakker stepped aside after admitting having a 
sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn 
under chapter 11 the heritage usa theme park and hotel 
television network and other facilities are allowed to operate 
without the threat of creditors lawsuits until a plan is developed 
to put the finances in order the sale proceeds would be applied to 
the ministrys debts which could reach 130 million

anesthesia has become remarkably safe despite 
bad publicity and big malpractice awards researchers reported today 
the patients age and condition and the difficulty of the 
operation are the determining factors in patient deaths said the 
study in the journal of american medical association 
the study analyzed deaths occurring within seven days of a 
particular operation among some 100000 patients administered 
anesthesia during surgery at the health sciences centre in winnipeg 
canada between 1975 and 1984 
studies 10 years ago showed the mortality rate directly 
associated with anesthesia to be 1 in 10000 cases said dr peter 
g duncan chairman of the department of anesthesia at the 
university of saskatchewan in canada 
the death rate due to anesthesia was 1 in 185000 in a recent 
british study the study at the winnipeg hospital indicated that 
anesthesia was virtually immeasurable as a cause of death 
anesthesia has become remarkably safe and the sensationalized 
major events that one reads about in the newspaper are very much 
the exception rather than the rule said duncan coauthor of the 
study 
errors by anesthesiologists such as failure to maintain 
patients oxygen supply can result in severe brain damage or death 
skyrocketing damage awards and malpractice insurance premiums 
resulting from such cases have hit anesthesiologists hard 
anesthesia doesnt add to the risk over and above that of the 
surgery itself and the extent of the medical problem the patient 
already has said dr marsha cohen of the university of manitobas 
departments of anesthesia and community health sciences coauthor 
of the study

sunni moslem militiamen and plo guerrillas 
searched this port city today for signs of a swiss delegate of the 
international committee of the red cross who was kidnapped a day 
earlier by gunmen 
joint patrols combed the huge ein elhilweh refugee camp and 
nearby orange and banana groves on sidons southern outskirts amid 
heavy donwpours for clues on the whereabouts of peter winkler 
weve contacted everybody all palestinian and lebanese groups 
in sidon and so far there has been no word on winkler said 
winklers red cross collegue gerard bise no group has claimed 
responsibility for the abduction 
however police and the popular nasserite organization that has 
governed sidon since the 1975 outbreak of lebanons civil war said 
they believe he was kidnapped for a tradeoff with hussein hariri a 
lebanese shiite moslem aircraft hijacker held in switzerland since 
last year 
hariri 22 a member of the iranianbacked hezbollah is accused 
of hijacking an air afrique jetliner that was flying from rome to 
paris and forcing it to land at geneva on july 24 1987 he also is 
accused of killing a french passenger before he was overpowered and 
arrested 
no trial date has been set in geneva 
the fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god is an umbrella 
group for proiranian extremist factions holding most of the 14 
foreign hostages including nine americans in lebanon 
the longest held is terry a anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
a police spokesman theorized the fatahrevolutionary council 
faction of palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal kidnapped 
winkler on behalf of hezbollah 
the two groups have long been allied hezbollah is believed to 
have requested abu nidals people to kidnap the swiss for a possible 
exchange for hariri because hezbollah does not maintain any presence 
in the sidon region the spokesman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
about 80000 palestinians reside in the predominantly sunni sidon 
region mainly in ein elhilweh and the nearby mieh mieh refugee 
camp previous attempts to find kidnap victims in south lebanon have 
not always succeeded

lawyers for 15 mariel detainees sought lastminute 
delays today and members of the cuban exile community appealed to 
president reagan to block a justice department plan to send the 
prisoners back to cuba 
in the waning days of the reagan presidency we are making an 
appeal to the president not to leave as one of his legacies the 
commencement of the deportation process of cuban exiles to fidel 
castros hands said rafael penalver head of a task force aimed 
at protecting detainees 
the prisoners have completed their sentences and are being 
deported only because they arrived in the mariel boatlift in 1980 
penalver said 
but george calhoun director of the justice departments mariel 
review program said the 15 prisoners have been convicted in the 
united states of crimes ranging from murder and armed robbery to 
arson and rape and can legally be deported as undesirable aliens 
the detainees were among 125000 people who came to the united 
states in the 1980 boatlift and most have become lawabiding us 
residents many were criminals and mentally ill people released by 
cuban president fidel castro 
the justice department said thursday it would wait at least 72 
hours before deporting the detainees who are being held in strict 
lockdown in a prison in talladega ala they will be flown to cuba 
in the fairly near future calhoun said 
attorneys said they would file a lawsuit today in federal court 
in birmingham ala charging that the deportations would violate 
us guarantees of due process under the law 
the task force organized by miamis roman catholic auxiliary 
bishop agustin roman met to plan further action to stop the 
deportations 
roman and penalver were credited with negotiating an end to the 
federal prison riots a year ago in atlanta and oakdale la the 
rioting began after announcement of a us agreement with fidel 
castro to resume deportations 
the immigration and naturalization service has paroled about 
2400 of 3822 detainees held at that time about 400 others have 
been approved for parole and are awaiting release said ins 
spokesman duke austin those denied parole received a special review 
cary copeland a deputy associate attorney general said the 
department is reviewing the cases of about 500 more federal mariel 
detainees and several hundred more serving sentences in state and

george bushs righthand man for the last four 
years craig fuller said today that john sununus selection as 
presidential chief of staff and not his shows bush wants to 
bring in new people and energize the system 
fuller interviewed on the cbs morning news said hes not 
upset that bush passed him over in favor of sununu the governor of 
new hampshire 
asked if felt any sense of betrayal fuller replied none 
whatsoever and added that bush had chosen a fine man to head his 
staff 
fuller the vice presidents chief of staff for the last four 
years noted that bush had said he wanted to bring a new team into 
washington and added 
the selection of john sununu shows that that commitment starts 
right with the man standing next to him in the white house in the 
chief of staff job i think it is a time to bring new people in and 
energize the system and let some of us who have been there 
particularly for eight years go out and help in other ways and do 
other things 
on thursday fuller the codirector of bushs transition office 
called the associated press before sununus appointment was 
announced to reveal that having been passed over for chief of staff 
he would quit working for bush as of jan 20 
fuller said he informed bush before the election that the only 
post he would accept in the new administration was chief of staff 
this morning fuller said that key jobs in the new administration 
are somehow viewed as contests and thats really not the way 
george bush made this selection 
i talked with the vice president in october during the campaign 
and said that i thought he was going to be elected and if he was 
id really like to return to the private sector fuller said 
i worked hard because i wanted to see george bush elected 
fuller said i got that and im ready to move on to the next 
phase of craig fullers life 
asked at a thursday afternoon news conference whether he would 
try to dissuade fuller from leaving bush said id like to 
because i have such a high regard for him 
for his part sununu said he hopes bush can succeed in twisting 
fullers arm between now and inauguration day and keeping craig in 
a position of responsibility 
fuller 37 who succeeded adm daniel murphy as bushs chief of 
staff in february 1985 said earlier that he had told bush he 
would be eager to the serve bush in the same capacity if bush 
were elected 
on election day fuller said bush indicated to me that he 
wanted sununu and that if my wishes were to return to the private 
sector hed understand i said that i would think about it he 
knew i would be willing to do it serve as chief of staff if he 
wanted me to do it 
fuller said he was not interested in any job other than chief of 
staff and since he did not get it i decided it was a good break 
time after eight years i got what i wanted and that was george 
bush getting elected 
fuller said he was upset with widespread news reports in recent 
days which said he had been jockeying with sununu 49 for the top 
job since he had promised the vice president he would remain quiet 
about bushs decision until sununus appointment was announced 
with thursdays announcement fuller said he no longer felt 
obliged to stay quiet 
fuller said he thought sununu would do a good job and said 
theres not a trace of bitterness at all john sununu is a good 
friend and hes going to get every ounce of support from me 
fuller whose wife karen is a white house secretary said he 
had no plans beyond jan 20 when bush will be sworn in as 
president except to say the couple will take a trip to africa in 
march 
before coming to washington as a member of president reagans 
white house staff in january 1981 fuller had been a vice president 
and corporate secretary of deaver amp hannaford inc a los 
angelesbased public affairs consulting firm

the unsolved slayings of a young family a year 
ago today have left townspeople leery not only of strangers but of 
each other 
its unbelievable that it could be somebody walking the streets 
and you might know him said joan sneed owner of the ina cafe in 
this town of 450 
on nov 18 1987 a sheriffs deputy found the badly beaten 
bodies of ruby elaine dardeen 30 her son peter sean 3 and the 
girl she gave birth to during the attack with a baseball bat in 
their mobile home 
the baby later named casey elaine by her grandparents was born 
alive and killed with blows to the head authorities said mrs 
dardeen had been 7 months pregnant 
the body of russell keith dardeen the 29yearold husband and 
father was found by hunters the next day he had been shot three 
times in the head police said 
townspeople this week said residents no longer are as trusting as 
they were before the slayings previously doors went unlocked at 
night 
despite 822 interviews that have led investigators all over the 
country a 10000 reward from the dardeen family and a stream of 
leads the case remains unsolved 
any closer to a suspect or an arrest no said jefferson 
county sheriffs capt mike anthis who heads the investigation 
we dont see that around the corner 
its one of those situations it could be tomorrow next week 
next month you dont know it may be another year from now its 
kind of like working a 5000piece jigsaw puzzle 
police have no motive said anthis who acknowledged that the 
longer the case goes unsolved the more difficult solution becomes 
rick hobler the attorney for the dardeen estate said relatives 
were frustrated about the lack of a break in the case but remain 
hopeful 
the families are religious families and they both believe that 
their prayers will be answered hobler said theyre convinced 
that something thats right will happen both families chose to 
speak through hobler 
the slayings are no longer the primary topic of conversation at 
the fourtable ina cafe said mrs sneed but its always in the 
back of everybodys mind who did it and why

treasury secretary nicholas brady said today he 
does not believe that concern over the us deficit has caused the 
fall in the value of the dollar or the declines on stock markets 
since george bush was elected president 
brady also said he does not expect interest rates to rise 
markets go up and down brady said on nbctvs today 
show the currency markets which are down in the last six weeks 
are really at the same levels they were in january of last year i 
dont really worry about it very much 
asked if the declines indicate a lack of confidence in bushs 
ability to overcome the deficit brady said i just disagree the 
bush deficitreduction plan which is called a flexible freeze will 
work i think we have to give the vice president a little time to 
put his team together 
im confident that things will work out just fine said 
brady who will continue as treasury secretary when bush takes 
office jan 20 
but new hampshire gov john sununu whom bush has appointed his 
presidential chief of staff said in another interview that there is 
a little bit of nervousness out there 
seeking to reassure the financial community he added i think 
the world can feel comfortable that george bush knows that strong 
leadership in dealing with the deficit is the first priority of this 
administration 
he was interviewed on abctvs good morning america 
intervention by central banks pushed the dollar up early today in 
europe and japan after the dollar closed at a 15year low against 
the japanese yen on thursday us stock markets have fallen more 
than 75 points since bush was elected 10 days ago 
brady said he sees no need for bush to take action before his 
jan 20 inauguration to allay the concerns of financial and currency 
markets 
i dont think the concern is that big a problem he said 
adding that bush would work with congress to combat the deficit 
im confident things will be worked out 
i dont see anything in the figures right now that would 
indicate interest rates are going to rise he said noting low 
unemployment high economic production and continued economic 
expansion 
brady said that although bush has promised not to raise taxes he 
will find ways to cut the deficit 
i think when the vice president gets into office youll 
hear from him very directly what he wants to do he said 
house majority leader thomas foley of washington also 
interviewed by nbc pledged support for the new administration in 
dealing with the economy 
its fair to give the vice president a chance to appoint his 
key financial advisers and budget director before there is any 
discussion with congress he said but he said congress would like 
to see a general outline of bushs plan for approaching the budget 
were not going to initiate any revenues if the vice president 
is going to oppose them foley said there no danger that the 
democratic congress is going to go knocking on president bushs door 
insisting on taxes its going to have to come from him 
sununu said he expects that in the next few days bush will 
communicate directly with the congressional leadership to begin 
the kind of interaction that necessary 
i think congress and the president are going to work 
aggressively and quickly to deal with that issue

picking a takecharge kind of guy as his chief of staff said 
today he intends fill out his economic team and then turn to 
national security posts 
bush here for a private meeting with several governors told 
reporters he planned to flesh out the economic side of the house 
i think and then start working on national security 
asked if that meant he was preparing to name richard darman his 
longtime economic aide as director of the office of management and 
budget bush laughed but said nothing 
after the morning meeting bush was flying back to washington for 
a capitol hill lunch with the speaker of the house jim wright 
as the day began new hampshire gov john sununu publicly picked 
by bush thursday as his next chief of staff told a television 
interviewer that the presidentelect would communicate directly with 
congress to begin the kind of interaction thats necessary to 
address the federal budget deficit 
i think congress and the president are going to work 
aggressively and quickly to deal with that issue sununu said on 
abctvs good morning america 
bush said his meeting with 18 governors and governorselect was 
intended to send an early signal to the governors and the states 
of my interests in working with the governors democrats and 
republicans alike 
he also said he wants to meet with the governors early to discuss 
the environment and education 
there was unusual turmoil in the bush ranks thursday when the 
presientelect announced his selection of sununu as chief of staff 
and endorsed lee atwater his wily campaign manager as the next 
chairman of the republican party 
craig l fuller bushs vice presidential chief of staff for four 
years and codirector of the transition called the associated press 
beforehand to reveal that having been passed over for chief of 
staff he would quit working for bush as of jan 20 
fuller said he informed bush before the election that the only 
post he would accept in the new administration was chief of staff 
he said he harbored no ill will toward sununu 
sources close to bush said fuller had been offered several plums 
including transportation secretary and head of the national 
aeronautics and space administration but had turned them down 
in choosing the conservative bluntspoken sununu and atwater a 
bareknuckled campaign strategist bush may have been indicating to 
democrats who control congress that he is prepared to play political 
hardball 
but he sounded a different note at his news conference saying he 
expects sununu to build a constructive relationship with 
congress he also called sununu a takecharge kind of guy with 
the experience to work with his former colleagues in the statehouses 
bush who previously announced his choice of james a baker iii 
as secretary of state and nicholas f brady as a holdover treasury 
secretary said he expects to announce a director for the office of 
management and budget soon 
transition sources have said that post is likely to go to darman 
while stanford university economist michael j boskin is likely to 
be chairman of the council of economic advisers 
bush has had to contend with a succession of economic bad news 
since his election the stock market has fallen and the dollar has 
declined in value with many analysts questioning bushs ability or 
resolve to cut the nations massive trade and budget deficits 
bush aides hope fast action in naming his economic team will 
bolster confidence in the presidentelect 
brady asked on nbctvs today show if the behavior of stock 
prices and the dollars value indicate a lack of confidence in 
bushs ability to overcome the deficit replied i just disagree 
the bush deficitreduction plan which is called a flexible 
freeze will work i think we have to give the vice president a 
little time to put his team together im confident that things will 
work out just fine 
but sununu in his interview said he feels that there is a 
little bit of nervousness out there 
bush said the omb job is important and i want to get our 
economic team in place most people would agree weve moved very 
fast so far but i will go forward with the economic team 
bush who had a breakfast meeting thursday with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and lunch with president reagan also 
held a private chat with former texas sen john tower who is 
rumored to be a leading candidate for secretary of defense 
bush defended sununu an arabamerican for his refusal to sign a 
proclamation two years ago condemning a 1975 united nations 
resolution that equated zionism with racism sununu was the only 
governor to balk at signing such a proclamation 
bush said sununu was well within his prerogative to not want 
to meddle in foreign policy as a governor everybody knows my 
position on it that i think that un resolution is outrageous 
and should be repealed bush said he also pointed to sununus role 
in drafting the 1988 republican platform which called for a 
rescission of that un resolution 3379 
sununu told reporters i have no problem saying that that 
resolution ought to be repudiated 
sununu 49 is an engineer by training and a former tufts 
university professor with no previous experience in washington 
asked about his reputation for having a short fuse sununu joked 
im a pussycat 
he said his main task will be to serve as an honest broker 
and present bush with as much information as possible about the 
decisions he must make 
sununu said today that if i can blend into the woodwork while 
bush gets the visibility thats the way it should be done 
bush said atwaters job will be winning elections for the gop 
hes no 1 and he knows the party apparatus from top to 
bottom said bush atwater 37 is certain to get the job jan 18 
when the republican national committee meets to choose a successor 
to frank fahrenkopf jr who is stepping down after six years

donna rice the miami model whose association 
with gary hart ended his 1988 presidential campaign canceled an 
appearance before a group of journalists today after spotting 
cameras waiting for her 
ms rice said in a handwritten statement moments before her 
slated appearance that she had expected her meeting with the society 
of professional journalistssigma delta chi to be private and 
offtherecord 
as you are probably aware for the past year and a half i have 
purposely avoided capitalizing on my notoriety and except for three 
specific interviews i have declined all media offers she said in 
the statement 
when the societys invitation was received i felt that today 
might be an opportunity to quietly and candidly share with you some 
of my experiences and observations 
however it was my original understanding that this panel 
discussion was private and essentially off the record but when i 
arrived a few minutes ago and i saw the cameras lights and tape 
recorders i realized this wasnt the forum i anticipated 
james plante national president of spjsdx said he believed 
that ms rice knew her appearance at the albert b sabin cincinnati 
convention center would be on the record 
plante an administrator with nbc news in new york said spjsdx 
general counsel bruce sanford who arranged ms rices appearance 
about three weeks ago had assured plante that the session would be 
on the record 
she was uncomfortable about the cameras said plante who 
spoke with ms rice moments before her decision to avoid the session 
she wanted to share her ideas about whats happened in her life 
with the group privately but she didnt want to do it in front of 
the cameras

claimed the support of a majority of newly elected national assembly 
members and predicted no obstacles in her attempt to become the 
first woman to lead a moslem nation 
ms bhutto 35 told reporters her party commanded a majority 
from wednesdays elections because some new assembly members have 
joined her pakistan peoples party party since then and others have 
pledged their support 
however she refused to say how many new assembly members now 
belonged to her party or to give further details 
her pakistan peoples party captured 92 seats in the 237member

despite our simple majority we are prepared to expand our base 
of cooperation with other parties if they take the initiative she 
told reporters at her walled compound in karachi

form a government and ms bhutto on thursday urged president ghulam 
ishaq khan to give her party the mandate 
when asked by a reporter if she foresaw any problems in becoming 
prime minister she replied i dont see any obstacle

recapturing the post lost by her father zulfikar ali bhutto when 
he was ousted in a coup led by zia in 1977 bhutto was convicted of 
complicity in a political murder plot and hanged in 1979 
zia ruled by martial law for eight years after the coup then 
held national elections in 1985 in which candidates were not allowed 
to be affiliated with political parties 
the general dismissed the government and national assembly in may 
on grounds of corruption incompetence and delay in putting pakistan 
under islamic law zia called wednesdays election before the plane 
crash aug 17 in which he the us ambassador and 28 other people 
were killed a government inquiry blamed the crash on sabotage 
both ms bhutto and the conservative islamic democratic alliance 
have said they would continue pakistans friendship with the united 
states and support of moslem guerrillas fighting the communist 
government of neighboring afghanistan 
ms bhutto also has said she will pursue zias program of 
increasing the influence of islam in the nations life but she 
pledged not to let the religious policy interfere with the rights of 
women and minorities 
in a statement released thursday by her representatives in 
washington she said she looked forward to working with the us 
government to build and further strengthen the special 
relationship that exists the united states has a 402 billion 
sixyear program of military aid for pakistan

refugees who fled their country after the 1979 soviet military 
intervention and is a channel for supplies to the usbacked afghan 
guerrillas

we congratulate the pakistani people and their leaders for this 
impressive and important step in strengthening democracy in 
pakistan

central banks intervened in foreign exchange 
markets today and purchased large amounts of dollars for the second 
straight day in an attempt to stabilize the us currencys sagging 
value 
money brokers said the federal reserve west german bundesbank 
and other central banks of major us trading partners were 
aggressively buying dollars with yen marks and other key currencies 
its the same cast of characters similar to yesterdays 
intervention said robert hatcher a foreign exchange trader at 
the new york branch of britains barclays bank 
for the central banks its a case now of wearing down the 
markets inclination to sell dollars hatcher said the first 
step of course is to get the dollar to stop falling the second step 
is getting people interested in buying dollars thats going to take 
awhile 
others said the dollar may have been helped by treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady who told nbcs today show hes not concerned 
with the currency market gyrations and does not attribute the 
dollars trouble to fear that presidentelect george bush wont 
solve the us trade and budget deficits 
after falling to record or nearrecord levels following bushs 
election last week the dollar was mostly higher thursday on a wave 
of central bank intervention it rose again this morning from 12152 
yen in tokyo to 12215 yen and strengthened further in london and 
new york to the 123yen level 
against the west german mark the dollar was largely unchanged at 
the 17430 level and was slightly lower against the british pound at 
about 181 
gold opened in london at a bid price of 41950 a troy ounce 
down from 422 late thursday gold was also down in zurich and hong 
kong 
despite its relative stability this morning economists said the 
dollar will need much more than centralbank intervention for its 
longterm health and some predicted the foreign exchange markets 
would soon push the dollar lower again 
intervention is the direct buying or selling of currencies by 
central banks if the purchases are large enough they can influence 
prices directly when the fed or the bank of japan or the west 
german bundesbank buys dollars directly that reduces the supply of 
dollars available and sends up the price 
robert a brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities 
co international said traders here and abroad still are concerned 
that bush and the democraticcontrolled congress will be unable to 
work together to narrow the huge gaps in trade and the federal 
budget and if left unchecked both factors could hurt the economy 
each side appears wedded to their own views and they will be 
unable to compromise until theyve substantially ground each other 
up he said 
the dollars rebound lent some support to the stock market 
thursday the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed up 
1405 points at 205263 
but bond prices slipped the treasurys bellwether 30year bond 
finished lower by about 5 per 1000 in face value with its yield 
rising to 915 percent from late wednesdays 911 percent some 
analysts blamed the decline on the treasurys auction of 903 
billion in new 30year bonds on thursday 
the financial markets worry that a weak dollar could drive up 
interest rates and spark higher inflation which in turn depresses 
bond prices because it would raise prices of imports and some 
domestic commodities

a nationwide search for four young adults 
ended with the recovery of bodies from a car in a river but 
questions remain whether the accident was a deadly combination of 
illegal drinking missing safety barriers and a misdirected detour 
sign 
a car containing what authorities believed were the bodies of the 
four young people was found thursday in 15 feet of water on the 
bottom of the murky mill river near new haven harbor 
authorities were awaiting autopsy results to make positive 
identifications but city police lt james sorrentino said it was 
likely the four victims were the missing friends who graduated 
together from east lyme high school in 1987 
the three women and one man were last seen by their parents about 
7 pm saturday when they left their hometown of east lyme for a 
night in new haven 
the four were jill sawyer 19 a student at the university of 
rhode island christy stevens 19 a student at mohegan community 
college in norwich michael gallo 20 a student at southern 
connecticut state university and laura lagrotteria 19 
they were good kids i cant picture them being drunk and 
driving said michelle funaioli a student at southern 
connecticut its horrible its the most horrible thing ive ever 
seen happen 
police have determined the four spent at least part of saturday 
night drinking at a bar near yale university state police detective 
andre trudelle said a bar employee told authorities that the friends 
left together about 3 am sunday the legal drinking age in 
connecticut is 21 
their car apparently traveled down chapel street went over a 
concrete barrier that was in place thursday and plunged into the 
river sorrentino said the street has been a dead end for years 
because the chapel street bridge is out of service 
officials said the bridge pivots open on a center axis to allow 
water traffic to pass and has been in its open position for years 
private investigator francis bud mullen former head of the 
federal drug enforcement administration said he believed the 
barrier was not in place at the time of the accident mullen was 
hired by the youths families to find them after they were reported 
missing the families also put up a 20000 reward for helping to 
locate them 
several news reports quoting unidentified sources also said no 
barriers were in place the night of the accident 
i have no information either way sorrentino said ive 
been led to believe the barriers were always there 
police had decided to drag the citys rivers for the missing 
adults and the area beneath the closed bridge was the first place 
searched sorrentino said 
this was an area that we thought was a likely place for a car 
to go off the road and into the water he said theres no other 
place where there is a bridge out 
with several questions unanswered including whether a sign 
incorrectly directed traffic down the deadend street to the bridge 
new haven mayor biagio dilieto told city officials to complete a 
report on the accident by today 
on thursday two signs leading to the bridge warned of danger 
ahead one was a small green sign restricting the road to local 
traffic only the other was an orange detour sign with an arrow that 
incorrectly directs traffic to the dead end 
the public works department referred calls to city corporation 
counsel brian murphy he was in a meeting thursday evening and 
unavailable for comment his secretary said 
a thursday night prayer service for the victims planned when 
they were still missing turned into a tearful memorial ceremony 
attended by about 200 friends and relatives at a niantic church 
there are no words to take away your pain said assistant 
pastor laurie whinnem etter the only way to respond is to 
celebrate the love and the joy that these friends shared 
edward j jadovich the states acting liquor control 
commissioner said his department planned to investigate at least 
two bars because of reports that the four spent saturday night bar 
hopping he declined to identify the bars

allegations that a cornell university graduate student created a 
virus that jammed a nationwide network of university and 
military computers a prosecutor said 
assistant us attorney andrew baxter on thursday declined to say 
when the panel began hearing evidence or whether anyone has been 
subpoenaed to testify 
i can say this is the only district in which a grand jury 
investigation is pending some evidence has been presented to the 
grand jury baxter said 
cornell student robert t morris jr 23 is suspected of 
unleashing the virus earlier this month disrupting 6000 computers 
nationwide 
morris has told friends he didnt intend any harm 
the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation to determine 
whether statutes on wire fraud malicious mischief or unlawful 
access to stored communications may have been broken no charges 
have been filed 
the fbi has subpoenaed computer tapes and other records at 
cornells computer science department 
baxter declined to say whether anyone other than morris is the 
target of the grand jury investigation in syracuse 
a computer virus works by duplicating itself infecting one 
computer after another as users share floppy disks or link up over 
telephone lines 
the virus this month did its damage by rapidly duplicating 
itself thereby slowing computers processing speed and taking up

lithuanians today raised the flag of the formerly 
independent republic over their parliament building after lawmakers 
declared it the republics new banner and lithuanian the official 
language 
editors of official lithuanian television said debate was under 
way on an amendment to the lithuanian constitution challenging 
moscows authority by requiring the republics approval of any new 
national law 
a russian newspaper accused neighboring estonia of fostering 
ethnic tension by declaring estonian its national language earlier 
this week 
the television editors in a telephone interview from vilnius 
the capital said the red green and yellow flag was raised in a 
ceremony immediately after the vote was taken 
the parliament declared the official government language the 
flag and an old national song as the national hymn said editor 
vitautus makauskas of the official television which provided a live 
broadcast 
it also protested proposed amendments to the soviet constitution 
that residents of the three tiny baltic republics of lithuania 
estonia and latvia say will limit their autonomy he said he could 
not give exact totals but said there were very few dissenting votes 
the meeting in lithuania and demonstrations planned later today 
marking the 70th anniversary of independence in latvia were signs 
of resurgent nationalism in the soviet republics that are using 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms to push for greater 
autonomy 
lithuania estonia and latvia were independent between the world 
wars but were annexed by the soviet union in 1940 following a pact 
between the soviets and the nazis 
residents of the baltics have increasingly pushed for more 
economic and cultural freedom under gorbachevs reform policy 
thousands in the three republics have joined peoples front 
organizations which recently have spread to the slavic republics of 
byelorussia and the ukraine 
the baltics have been angered by amendments to the national 
constitution proposed by gorbachev saying they would shift the 
little power they have to central authorities in moscow and 
eliminate their constitutional right to secede 
the united states backed the baltic nationalists thursday state 
department spokesman charles redman said in washington the united 
states does not recognize the forcible incorporation of the baltic 
states the people of the baltic states have been denied their 
basic human rights 
sovietskaya rossiya the official newspaper of the russian 
republic today cited rising tensions between nationalities in 
estonia picking up a theme sounded by politburo member and former 
kgb secret police chief viktor m chebrikov in a visit to estonia 
last weekend 
on thursday kremlin expressed doubt about the constitutionality 
of the estonian parliaments proclamation on wednesday that it has 
the right to review any new law passed in moscow and its 
declaration of sovereignty in all areas except foreign policy 
and defense 
it called estonian leaders to the soviet capital for a meeting 
with the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys highest 
executive body of which gorbachev is the chairman estonian leaders 
said on a flight late thursday to moscow from tallinn that they 
expected the summons to moscow 
perestroika is a hope and democracy is a hope and every hope 
has a moment of unease the newly elected estonian premier indrek 
toome said 
the dialogue has begun said igor grazin the estonian lawyer 
who wrote the legislation and will defend it before the presidium 
chebrikov sharply criticized estonias communist party for 
fueling nationalism and warned the leadership was causing tension 
between the republics ethnic groups 
establishment of estonian as the official language of the 
republic is on the agenda for a future meeting official statistics 
say 61 percent of estonias 15 million people are ethnic estonians 
about 28 percent are russians 
ethnic lithuanians make up 80 percent of the population of 
lithuanias 37 million people 
sovietskaya rossiya presumably speaking for the ethnic russians 
said the new language legislation was poorly worked out and that 
about 100000 people had attended meetings in estonia protesting the 
establishment of the official language as illegal and 
antidemocratic

the citys christmas decorations have to 
be thrown out because they were contaminated by potentially 
cancercausing asbestos dust but officials today said money has 
been donated for replacements 
wanda bass of the first national community development corp gave 
the city a check for 2500 which will be matched by the city 
officials said 
the decorations were stored with other city parks department 
material in the old navy reserve center 
an inspection of the building this year revealed old insulation 
was releasing asbestos particles into the air asbestos has been 
identified as a potential cancercausing substance when inhaled 
mel priddy head of the parks and recreation department said 
cleaning the lights and other christmas decorations would require 
more labor than they were worth 
several items from the same room as the decorations have been 
removed and cleaned but it would probably be a very complicated 
process to clean the tinsel he said

the soviet union today recognized the proclamation 
of an independent palestinian state but stopped short of extending 
full diplomatic relations 
the soviet action announced at a hastily called news briefing by 
first deputy foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh appeared to be 
a cautious step between soviet support for the palestinian cause and 
its effort to improve relations with israel 
faithful to the fundamental principle of freedom of choice the 
soviet union recognizes the proclamation of the palestinian state 
bessmertnykh said 
he said the soviet union believed a comprehensive settlement of 
the arabisraeli conflict will lead also to the practical 
completion of the historic process of creating this state 
asked whether his announcement amounted to recognition of the 
palestinian state bessmertnykh said in essence it did 
but a foreign ministry spokesman boris savastyanov said later 
in a telephone interview that it did not entail immediate exchange 
of diplomats and full diplomatic relations 
that requires additional work he said adding that he could 
not speculate on when it might occur 
the palestine national council meeting in algiers on tuesday 
declared an independent palestinian state the council is the 
policymaking body of the palestine liberation organization and is 
considered the palestinian parliamentinexile 
cyprus east germany and the christian faction of lebanons 
divided government announced recognition today of the palestinian 
state bringing to at least 28 the number of countries to extend 
diplomatic ties 
in lebanon the recognition came from the christian cabinet of 
army commander gen michel aoun but there was no statement from a 
rival moslem cabinet lebanon has had two governments since 
parliament failed to elect a successor to president amin gemayel 
when his term expired sept 23 
the declaration in algeria did not define the boundaries of the 
palestinian nation saying it would be determined by future 
negotiations but the council accepted un resolution 242 which 
implicitly recognizes israel along with other un resolutions 
including one calling for palestinian selfdetermination 
the soviet unions recognition of the proclamation of the 
palestinian state comes as the soviets continue to pursue a gradual 
thaw in relations with israel 
the soviet union severed diplomatic relations with israel in 1967 
after that years middle east war it has backed the plo under 
yasser arafat and supported arab demands that israel give back 
occupied territory 
but the soviets also have tried under president mikhail s 
gorbachev to improve ties with israel lowlevel delegations have 
exchanged visits and the soviets have loosened some restrictions on 
jewish emigration 
the soviet union praised the realism and responsibility of the 
plo sessions decision to accept un resolution 242 which also 
requires israel to withdraw from territories it occupied in the 1967 
war 
it also is pressing for a middle east peace conference including 
the five permanent members of the un security council such a 
conference presumably would give the soviet union a greater say in 
the middle east 
cyprus became the second nation that has relations with israel to 
recognize the new palestinian state the plo already has a mission 
with diplomatic status in nicosia 
turkey is the only other country that recognizes israel and the 
palestinian homeland the israeli foreign ministry summoned the 
turkish charge daffaires on wednesday to criticize the move 
among the arab countries only syria egypt and its close ally 
oman have stopped short of recognition but egyptian president hosni 
mubarak called his endorsement of the declaration stronger than 
recognition 
states which have recognized the palestinian state are 
afghanistan algeria bahrain bangladesh cyprus east germany 
india indonesia iraq jordan kuwait lebanon libya madagascar 
malaysia mauritania morocco nicaragua north and south yemen 
qatar pakistan saudi arabia sudan tunisia turkey the united 
arab emirates and yugoslavia 
in addition the egyptian daily alahram said that cuba zambia 
and somalia also had recognized the palestinian homeland but cited 
no source for the report palestinian officials said cuba and 
singapore have recognized the state but there has been no 
confirmation from officials in those governments

an agency trying to predict earthquakes 
has developed a system to give warnings of another geological 
hazard landslides which 25 to 50 americans and cause up to 2 
billion in damage each year 
the experimental system so far has been used only in the san 
francisco bay area 
but it is meant to demonstrate the possibility of issuing such 
warnings elsewhere in the nation so people in slideprone hilly 
areas can evacuate if necessary us geological survey geologist 
raymond wilson said thursday 
wilson likened landslides to a runaway freight train going 
through a neighborhood 
its a national problem said david keefer leader of the 
agencys landslide research group total us landslide damages 
are estimated at somewhere between 1 billion and 2 billion a 
year with 25 to 50 americans killed annually 
landslide damages in the united states are larger on an 
annual basis that earthquake damage or volcano damage he added 
they spoke at the geological surveys geohazards 88 symposium 
which drew about 250 scientists and public officials the twoday 
symposium focuses on the hazards posed by earthquakes landslides 
volcanoes and water pollution 
the warning system was tested successfully on feb 14 1986 when 
a severe rainstorm prompted the geological survey and national 
weather service to warn that mudslides were possible during a 
sixhour period for much of the bay area 
similar warnings were issued in marin napa and sonoma counties 
north of the bay for a 60hour period beginning feb 17 1986 
eight of 10 known landslides during that storm occurred during 
the two warning periods the scientists said although they added it 
wasnt possible to know if lives were saved by the alerts 
the weather service transmitted the warnings to newspapers and 
radio and tv stations in its regular forecasts special weather 
statements and flash flood warnings 
the bay area has been relatively dry since 1986 and no warnings 
have been issued since then he added 
the agency depends on 60 bay area rain gauges that automatically 
relay measurements to the geological survey and the weather service 
and on reports from nearly 400 volunteers who have backyard rain 
gauges 
the geological survey developed the warning system after a storm 
in 1982 dropped as much as 24 inches of rain in 34 hours triggering 
18000 landslides in nine bayarea counties said geologist earl 
brabb in all the years before 1982 geologists had mapped 70000 
landslides in the same counties he said

you cant accuse neil simon of shortchanging the 
audience on plot in his latest comedy rumors which opened 
thursday at broadways broadhurst theater 
there are gunshots a car crash several marital spats group 
therapy by telephone and enough household accidents to fill the 
emergency room at bellevue 
with his autobiographical trilogy of brighton beach memoirs 
biloxi blues and broadway bound complete simon has returned 
to the more machinegun style of comedy writing he perfected in 
plays like the odd couple and the sunshine boys 
rumors isnt in that class but it does offer some slambang 
humor particularly in a delirious first act 
the playwright calls rumors a farce and youll know that as 
soon as the curtain goes up on designer tony straiges opulent 
twostory suburban living room there are seven doors three 
upstairs and four down just waiting to be opened and slammed shut 
were at a 10th anniversary party for a couple named charlie and 
myra everybodys done up in tuxedos and evening dresses and the 
food is in the kitchen waiting to be prepared but where are the 
hosts well charlies upstairs in the bedroom after shooting 
himself in the ear myra cant be found although no one seems to 
suspect foul play 
the guests who include charlies lawyer tax accountant 
pyschoanalyst and a wouldbe state senator as well as their wives 
try to pretend that nothing is wrong for much of act 1 their 
pretense is amusing particularly when carried out by such masters 
of desperation as ron leibman the harried accountant done in by 
whiplash from that auto accident and christine baranski the 
lawyers wife who cant quite get over her nicotine habit 
miss baranski is a vision of comic neurosis dressed in a poufy 
pink miniskirt a witty design by joseph g aulisi she frantically 
puffs her way through the play with a conviction that is supremely 
funny 
the weird thing is why these guests are so secretive about 
charlies and myras difficulties and why they want to keep things 
hushhush even from each other their deceptions cause all the 
panic on stage and yet they are not explained convincingly 
still if you ignore the logic you can savor director gene saks 
brilliant job of orchestrating the partygoers maniacal behavior 
there are joyce van pattens contortions as she drops to the floor 
without warning she explains that she has a bad back and never 
knows when spasms might occur 
mark nelson miss baranskis cautious lawyer husband spends much 
of the play misinterpreting conversation he was sitting too close 
when one of those gunshots went off 
andre gregory his fingers bandaged after a particularly nasty 
kitchen burn has a tough time serving drinks with his singed 
digits jessica walter nursing a bruised lip from the battered bmw 
tries to calm her hysterical husband the volatile mr liebman and 
lisa banes smolders sexily as the pentup wife of the politician 
played with the right degree of pomposity by ken howard 
simon certainly keeps his story spinning well into the second

an unconvincing ending thats something that shouldnt happen in a 
farce surely one of the most difficult things to write after all 
that running around the strands of the plot should be tied up 
neatly in rumors they are covered up by the final curtain but 
until that unsatisfactory conclusion there is much to cheer and 
laugh at in rumors 
in other reviews 
frank rich in the new york times wrote maybe ive led a

since the ninth grade mr simon may have been too long away 
from his original calling a lot of his gag machinery is rusty 
in the daily news howard kissel called the play scattershot 
and said it seemed as if it were written by a side of simon that 
turns out comedies with no soul where every other line is 
intended to get a laugh as if to meet some abstract quota 
but clive barnes in the new york post said broadway has 
something to cheer about again totally frivolous this maze of 
mendacity is light frothy and fun it is as significant as a cream

to israels great relief the latest moves by 
the palestine liberation organization were given a tepid reception 
by the reagan and soontobe bush administrations 
the white house detected some positive elements in the latest 
session of the plos quasilegislature and the state department 
found some encouraging signs 
but the reagan administration did not pick up chairman yasser 
arafats invitation to use the policy statement adopted tuesday in 
algiers by the palestine national council as a vehicle for seeking 
concessions from israel 
and from inside the bush camp came the judgment that the plo had 
taken a slight step forward in the right direction under 
pressure from palestinians on the west bank and in gaza 
but an anonymous bush foreign policy aide told the new york 
times theyre still operating on the basis of the lowest common 
denominator to meet them and reward them would send the wrong 
signal 
bush meanwhile said the jury is still out and added 
ambiguously there may be reason to be less fully optimistic about 
it 
israel in the throes of trying to form a new government already 
had dismissed the plo moves as irrelevant so the us reaction must 
have been a welcome relief 
however the soviet union following in the path of some two 
dozen arab and third world countries recognized the plos 
declaration of independence 
that kept the heat on israel at weeks end and it could be 
turned up if the west europeans decide the plo has gone far enough 
to warrant concessions from israel 
william b quandt the national security councils middle east 
specialist under former president jimmy carter says the plo has 
made a significant move inadequate as it may be 
in an interview thursday the brookings scholar said we ought 
to make a statement that invites another move 
he has studied the texts in arabic and compared them to the 
palestine national councils statements last year quandt finds a 
number of differences 
in 1987 for instance the council reinvoked the plo charter that 
calls for dismantling israel as a jewish state not this time 
the council last year rejected un security council resolution 
242 as a basis for a peace conference this time it was endorsed 
last time all un resolutions dealing with israel including 
the one in 1947 that provided for a much smaller piece of palestine 
were cited as a basis for negotiations this time quandt said the 
resolutions were cited to support selfdetermination for the 
palestinians 
they dont deal with recognition the way i would like quandt 
said for instance the council did not say if the palestinians got 
their own state they would be willing to live sidebyside with 
israel 
what they havent quite bit the bullet on is to say were 
ready to negotiate with israel on the basis of 242 instead of going 
to a peace conference on that basis the former us official 
said that would remove some ambiguity 
in any event the council has not met the threepart us test 
for recognition and israelis of varying political stripes did not 
revise their abhorrence of the plo and terrorism 
the councils most significant move was to declare its readiness 
to have peace talks held under un security council resolution 242 
adopted after the arabs were routed by israel in the 1967 sixday 
war it affirms the right of states in the region to live within 
secure borders 
recognition of israel is not specified in the resolution only 
implied 
the two other parts of the us test are that the plo explicitly 
recognize israel and that it renounce terrorism the council did not 
recognize the jewish state and asserted force could be used by 
guerrillas in israel and on the west bank and in gaza 
whatever the plos motives which could range from an 
unwillingness to play all their cards before there is a peace 
conference to unrelenting hostility to israel the failure to meet 
the test keeps the united states from responding to arafats 
challenge 
we feel that the ball is now in the american court he said 
tuesday in algiers 
clearly the reagan and bush administrations dont agree

the navy is recommending that the civilian 
crewmen on the munitions train that maimed an antiwar demonstrator 
last year receive 10day suspensions 
the union representative for the three crewmen james wright of 
the american federation of government employees accused the navy of 
making the crew scapegoats for the incident at the concord naval 
weapons station 
s brian willson lost his lower legs after sitting on the tracks 
in front of a moving train at the base 40 miles east of san 
francisco he was part of a group of demonstrators protesting 
american involvement in central america 
the crewmen were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing but have been 
on disability leave ever since claiming they were traumatized by 
the incident 
they have 30 days to appeal the navys recommendation which was 
signed by capt joseph micelli of the naval sea systems command in 
washington a navy spokeswoman thursday declined to comment on the 
proposed suspension 
brakeman bob mayfield who received his letter wednesday said he 
and the other crew members would fight the suspensions 
a lawyer for willson aj kutchins said the navys action 
certainly gives the lie to statements in the press that these men 
were merely innocent victims of brian willson who had the nerve to 
get himself run over 
willson is suing the crew and navy officials the crew has 
countersued willson and the same navy officials

anna maria chavez head of the yale cheerleading team the letter 
described as a personal apology by academy spokesman jay fromkin 
was not released 
he tried to explain it as a tradition ms chavez said but 
when it got out of hand it obviously wasnt something they 
condoned its over but not to the extent that it should be 
forgotten hopefully all this will prevent it from happening 
again 
academy officials have said the midshipmen meant no harm to the 
young woman and that such captures are a tradition at sporting 
events 
betty trachtenberg dean of student affairs at yale said she 
also had received an apology from academy officials 
that letter was adequate its a closed issue said ms 
trachtenberg who previously called the incident a form of sexual

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
began a threeday visit to india today pledging to maintain warm 
relations with indian despite comments and speculations to the 
contrary 
in an apparent reference to an improvement in both nations ties 
with china gorbachev said the development of relations with third 
countries would not affect sovietindian relations 
gorbachevs remarks were contained in a speech given at a dinner 
attended by prime minister rajiv gandhi on the first day of the 
soviet leaders threeday visit to india 
indian authorities mindful of afghan refugee opposition to 
soviet involvement in afghanistan asked the estimated 7000 afghans 
living in new delhi to stay in their homes while gorbachev is in 
town 
gorbachev did not mention china in his speech a text of which 
was released by the indian foreign ministry 
but it followed concerns expressed by some indian newspapers and 
by some indian officials that warmer relations between the worlds 
two biggest communist powers could affect moscows friendly ties 
with india 
referring to some comments and speculations that are not 
exactly friendly gorbachev said some go as far as saying that 
the soviet union is changing its priorities even becoming cool to 
india 
i shall not dignify with an answer such totally groundless and 
obviously speculative remarks gorbachev said 
gorbachevs visit to india his second in two years comes a 
month before gandhi is to travel to beijing the first trip to china 
by an indian prime minister in 34 years 
india and china have a longstanding border dispute and went to 
war in 1962 
there also are signs of an easing of strains between moscow and 
beijing highlighted by next years scheduled moscow visit by senior 
chinese leader deng xiaoping 
gorbachev and his wife raisa arrived in new delhi to a welcome 
marked by tons of roses decking the highway taken by his motorcade 
it was his first trip abroad since the title of presidency was added 
to his position as party leader nearly two months ago 
after a ceremonial reception gorbachev held the first of at 
least four scheduled talks with gandhi 
an indian foreign ministry spokesman who under briefing rules 
cannot be identified said the two leaders discussed general global 
and regional matters but did not discuss specifics 
schools were closed today in honor of gorbachevs visit more 
than 100000 students and 10000 teachers were asked to stand along 
the soviet motorcade route newspapers reported 
afghan refugees said they have been instructed to stay off the 
streets except to report to their nearest police stations every 
morning while gorbachev is here 
the police want to make sure all heads are accounted for 
said syed mohammad maiwand chairman of the international afghan 
elders association which claims 1300 members in new delhi they 
are treating us as if we were criminals 
india a founding member of the movement of nonaligned nations 
has friendly relations with moscow and washington but the soviets 
are a chief supplier of military equipment including jet fighter 
planes and tanks 
on wednesday the two countries signed a trade agreement for 
imports and exports worth 47 billion in 1989 more than double 
the estimated 19 billion for 1987 
gorbachev is scheduled to return to moscow on sunday

postal inspectors are investigating complaints 
from people who say they thought they had won a 5000 cash prize 
from a cancer research group only to find they received a dime in 
return for a donation 
we are in the factgathering stage at this point tom mcclure 
of the us postal inspection service said today 
watson and hughey co a directmail firm in alexandria va 
sent letters soliciting participation in a fundraising campaign on 
behalf of three cancer research organizations 
the washington post said one state official estimated the 
solicitation went to 48 million households in the country but jerry 
watson a partner in watson and hughey said that number is 
exaggerated 
our company designs maybe a hundred different sweepstakes a 
year he said and together the mailings dont add to that 
number 
watson said his company is only an advertising agency and has all 
copy for sweepstakes including the one involved checked by 
lawyers im not sure what the problem is he said 
the letters state that the recipient has won a cash prize in 
the 5000 sweepstakes and ask for a voluntary contribution of 5 
but closer reading reveals that the total value of the contest is 
5000 with a maximum individual award of 100 and a minimum of 10 
cents 
we have complaints where individuals have sent money in made 
contributions and received back a dime prize mcclure said 
asked whether anyone had received a 100 award mcclure said 
when people get that kind of money back they usually dont 
complain 
he said a dime prize falls into a gray area of the law since it 
is a cash award 
the post said the letters were signed by washington attorney 
robert r stone and sent on behalf of the pacific west cancer fund 
of seattle the knoxville tennbased cancer fund of america and 
the walker cancer research institute of edgewood md 
efforts to reach stone by telephone were unsuccessful his line 
was being checked for trouble according to a recorded announcement 
the post quoted stone as saying the solicitation was a legitimate 
fundraising effort for worthwhile organizations and that he thought 
the letter was clear 
the post said the mailings have prompted calls to consumer and 
legal agencies from people believing they had won 5000 lawsuits 
alleging consumer fraud in missouri and illinois consumer warnings 
in other states and investigations in virginia and by the federal 
government

presidentelect george bush is whittling away 
at the list of vacancies in his new administration but there are 
still so many top openings that the nameguessing game is the 
hottest thing in town 
bush picked john sununu the retiring new hampshire governor as 
his chief of staff on wednesday and chose lee atwater his election 
campaign manager as chairman of the republican national committee 
word of the latest appointments leaked out before they were 
officially announced but many decisions on whos in and whos out 
are tightly held by the inner circle of transition aides 
bush is known to dislike palace infighting and some hopefuls are 
keeping out of the public eye deborah steelman for example 
shes lying low a friend said of steelman 33 one of bushs 
key domestic campaign advisers shes been talked about for a 
highranking job somewhere possibly at the department of housing 
and urban development 
cleveland mayor george voinovich who lost his bid to unseat 
democratic sen howard metzenbaum this month has emerged as a 
leading candidate to head hud 
i am very pleased with all the rumors flying around that im 
being considered for something in washington but the fact of the 
matter is that i have made no contact whatsoever voinovich said 
earlier this week but he said he would listen to any job offers 
made to him by bush 
donald rumsfeld a candidate for defense secretary uttered what 
has come to be a common refrain around town im not in the habit 
of accepting things that havent been offered he said even so 
hes interested in the post he held in the ford administration 
new york rep jack kemp a loser to bush in the gop presidential 
primaries is being pushed by conservatives for a good job in the 
administration 
business groups are touting the former football quarterback for 
labor secretary to replace ann dore mclaughlin or even hud 
secretary replacing samuel pierce 
bush has ordered staffers to keep their mouths shut though hes 
indicated he is considering people for important posts in his 
economic team and soon will turn to national security posts two 
cabinet jobs already have been filled james a baker iii as 
secretary of state and nicholas brady as treasury secretary 
the latest thinking is that former texas sen john towers stock 
is still high to take over the defense department he has good 
relations with congress and he knows the subject matter he used to 
chair the armed services committee and he was a member of the us 
delegation to superpower arms talks in geneva 
other possible pentagon chiefs are paul h oneill chairman of 
the aluminum co of america and retired air force lt gen brent 
scowcroft onetime head of the national security council 
some new names surfaced thursday for transportation secretary 
but theyre viewed as longshots they include john riley head of 
the federal railroad administration and allan mcartor head of the 
federal aviation administration 
still seen as contenders are jim burnett a member and former 
chairman of the national transportation safety board new jersey 
gov thomas kean and rep guy molinari rny who ran bushs 
campaign in new york 
craig fuller codirector of the bush transition office had been 
talked about for the transportation job but he announced on 
wednesday that he will leave government after failing to win the 
white house chief of staff post

four black activists including 
three leaders of the countrys largest antiapartheid group were 
convicted today of treason they and seven codefendants convicted 
of terrorism could be put to death 
the verdicts culminated a threeyear trial on the role of the 
united democratic front a problack rights coalition formed in 
1983 the state alleged the front incited antigovernment violence 
in black townships in 1984 at a time when the coalitions leaders 
said they advocated peaceful protest 
supreme court justice kees van dijkhorst described the front as a 
revolutionary organization which sought to overthrow the 
government 
three of those convicted of treason were senior leaders who had 
spent 40 months in jail without bail popo molefe 36 who was the 
coalitions national secretary terror lekota 40 who was its chief 
spokesman and moses chikane 40 a leader of its transvaal province 
branch 
also convicted of treason was the rev thomas manthatha an 
activist in the vaal triangle area south of johannesburg where the 
first wave of unrest flared in september 1984 sentences are 
scheduled to begin dec 5 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu a coalition supporter said the 
convicted men were gentle rational people who in a democratic 
society would be regarded as civicminded and public spirited 
leaders 
im shattered by the verdict tutu said if any of these 
people are sent to prison i will not rest until i get them out if 
this is treason then i am guilty of treason 
eight of the 19 defendants were acquitted on all charges and 
seven were convicted of terrorism related to unrest in the vaal 
triangle 
a crowd which included us ambassador edward perkins packed 
into the courtroom but was subdued when dijkhorst announced the 
verdicts the judge began reading 1521page trial summary tuesday 
and his preliminary conclusions this week left no doubt the top 
defendants would be convicted 
we havent given up we will always maintain that the udf is a 
nonviolent organization said chikane before he and his 
colleagues gave clenchedfist salutes and were led away 
this is very disappointing said antiapartheid activist 
helen suzman a member of parliament this very much narrows the 
field of protest 
the front banned earlier this year was formed to mobilize 
opposition to a new constitution that entrenched the exclusion of 
the black majority from representation in parliament under 
apartheid blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the defendants had pleaded innocent to charges of treason 
terrorism murder and subversion related to the central allegation 
that the front and its affiliates incited violence in 1984 to make 
south africa ungovernable 
van dijkhorst said the state proved treason because violence was 
an intended facet of the township uprisings he also accepted 
prosecutors allegation that the core of the fronts leadership was 
supported and guided by the african national congress the main 
antigovernment guerrilla movement 
the front has maintained it endorsed the fronts political goals 
such as a oneperson onevote system but did not promote the use 
of violence 
before its banning in february the front had become the largest 
opposition group in south africa encompassing more than 600 
affiliated groups with 2 million members most front leaders are in 
detention in hiding or barred from political activity 
van dijkhorst presided over the nonjury trial since its start in 
1985

moslem worshipers released balloons bearing the 
image of plo chief yasser arafat and waved outlawed palestinian 
flags after weekly prayers today to celebrate the declaration of 
palestinian statehood 
in the gaza strip three palestinian youths were wounded one 
critically in clashes with israeli troops 
throughout the occupied lands troops were deployed near mosques 
to prevent nationalist demonstrations after moslem noon prayers the 
high point of the moslem week and often the scene of antiisraeli 
protests 
this weeks gatherings offered the first opportunity for many 
palestinians to celebrate independence because of widespread curfews 
and travel restrictions imposed by the army earlier this week 
also today palestinians ignored strike orders issued in the name 
of the moslem fundamentalist group hamas to protest the proclamation 
of statehood issued in algeria by the palestine national council 
the parliamentinexile of the palestine liberation organization 
leaders of hamas arabic for zeal claimed leaflets bearing 
the strike order were forged to confuse and divide palestinian 
activists it was not known if this was true or if the strike call 
failed for lack of organization and support hamas a chief rival of 
the plobacked unified national leadership of the uprising opposes 
the declaration of statehood because it implicitly recognizes israel 
at a mosque in gaza citys rimal neighborhood worshipers 
released balloons bearing arafats image after prayers an arab 
reporter said youths also burned tires near the mosque but 
soldiers did not interfere 
at three mosques in khan yunis troops blocked worshipers from 
entering for prayers the witnesses said 
a few dozen women carrying outlawed palestinian flags sang the 
anthem my homeland my homeland after prayers at the al aqsa 
mosque on jerusalems temple mount known in arabic as haram 
assharif 
three palestinian youths were wounded in separate clashes in the 
gaza strip today including a 16yearold who was in critical 
condition with a gunshot wound that fractured his skull doctors at 
gaza citys shifa hospital said army officials said they were 
checking the reports 
foreign minister shimon peres held a briefing for diplomats from 
42 countries today to explain israels rejection of the plo 
independence declaration an aide quoted peres as saying the 
declarations implicit recognition of israel was an attempt to 
mislead public opinion 
east germany cyprus and lebanon today formally recognized the 
independent palestinian state bringing to at least 28 the number of 
nations that have recognized it 
the soviet union today recognized the proclamation of an 
independent palestinian state but stopped short of extending full 
diplomatic relations the soviet action comes at a time when the 
soviets are moving toward closer ties with israel after breaking 
relations in 1967 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel declined to respond 
to the soviet move saying israel had to study and analyze it 
the army imposed widespread curfews and travel restrictions on 
most of the 15 million palestinians in the occupied lands in the 
days preceding and following the proclamation to choke off 
expressions of nationalist fervor 
the restrictions have been eased gradually since thursday and in 
the final move the army lifted curfews on gazas eight refugee camps 
today 
more than 7000 palestinians have been wounded since the uprising 
started dec 8 the death toll in the revolt is 313 palestinians and 
11 israelis

interest points paid to refinance a home 
mortgage may not be deducted fully in the year the loan is obtained 
the us tax court ruled friday 
the courts decision on an 83 vote upheld the position taken 
by the internal revenue service and means that points must be 
written off over the life of a home loan the ruling has no effect 
on points that must be paid to secure a loan that is used directly 
to buy or improve a home 
points essentially are an additional interest charge that some 
lenders impose to get around laws that limit interest rates they 
sometimes are paid by a homebuyer sometimes by a seller 
the tax court case which could be appealed grew out of a 
january 1981 decision by james r and zenith a huntsman to buy a 
home in stillwater minn instead of a more traditional 20year or 
30year mortgage they obtained a 122000 mortgage with a final 
balloon payment three years later before that three years was up 
they took out a second mortgage for a 22000 homeimprovement loan 
less than four months before the first mortgage fell due the 
huntsmans refinanced their home with a 30year loan that was used to 
pay off the first and second mortgages to obtain the new loan they 
had to pay 4440 in points which they deducted on their tax return 
the irs disallowed the full deduction on grounds the new loan was 
not used to buy or improve the huntsmans home the huntsmans were 
told they could deduct only 148 in each of the 30 years 
the law is unclear saying that points are fully deductible in 
the year they were paid only when the loan was used in connection 
with the purchase or improvement of a home 
in a refinancing transaction the funds generated by the loans 
generally are used not to purchase or improve a principal residence 
but to pay off the loan that is already in existence and thereby 
lower the interest costs incurred or achieve some other financial 
goal not connected directly with home ownership judge theodore 
tannenwald jr wrote for the majority of the court 
as a result the court held congress did not mean to allow an 
immediate full deduction for such points 
the key point was precisely what congress meant by the words in 
connection with tannenwald noted that in its own explanation 
ofthe 1975 law congress had stated that immediate deduction would 
not be permitted if a loan was used for purposes other than 
purchasing or improving the taxpayers principal residence 
dissenting judges contended that the ultimate purpose of the 
huntsmans 30year refinancing mortgage was to buy their home 
the hard reality is that the huntsmans were locked into a 
situation which necessitated that they obtain permanent financing 
or at least some type of refinancing within three years of the 
date of the purchase judge robert ruwe wrote for the minority 
when the huntsmans took out their original loan ruwe wrote it 
would have been evident to them and their lenders that the mortgage 
would have to be refinanced the couple with two dependent 
children reported an income of about 71000 in 1983 
from the standpoint of an ordinary person who is purchasing a 
home with the proceeds of a large loan payable three years from the 
date of purchase refinancing would be a foreseeable necessity in 
connection with the purchase the dissenters contended

vietnam war veterans are climbing back 
aboard military helicopters to confront their painful memories as 
part of a program treating them for posttraumatic stress syndrome 
all vietnam veterans seem to have at least several vivid 
memories involving helicopters said dr raymond scurfield 
director of the american lake veterans administration hospitals 
posttraumatic stress treatment clinic 
ten veterans at a time undergo an intense 11week program 
including rides aboard a huey helicopter used in the vietnam war 
about 350 vets have been through the program since it was 
established three years ago with the cooperation of the washington 
state national guard and it now has an 18month waiting list 
scurfield said 
posttraumatic stress syndrome is marked by intrusive imagery 
rage depression grief and feelings of isolation he said 
helicopter therapy was proposed by elke faleafine a licensed 
nurse practitioner at the clinic who noticed that many veterans 
reacted strongly to helicopter sounds during therapy sessions and 
spoke often of hueys 
she suggested giving them a chance to relive that experience 
partly to overcome their fear of choppers but also to help bring to 
the surface many of the memories and feelings they had been trying 
desperately to suppress 
a lot of feelings came up a lot of memories came back she 
said they remember a lot of friends they lost but they also 
remember how strong and together they felt 
on thursday a chopper made four flights at fort lewis carrying 
veterans and clinic staffers in maneuvers similar to those most 
commonly used in the war in one maneuver used to drop off troops 
the helicopter banked at a 35degree angle swept toward a grassy 
landing zone on the base and touched down briefly before racing away 
a few feet above nearby trees 
some veterans held hands during the flight many hugged each 
other when it was over and one was near tears saying the last time 
he flew in a huey was when he was flown from an ambush scene where 
18 of his 35 comrades had died 
helicopters were a sign of death said one of the vets jerry 
carlson and you know theyre part of life today 
carlson said he enrolled in the program after finding himself 
pointing a gun at his head after nearly two decades of recurring 
drug abuse 
the treatment had helped him stay off drugs and reduced his 
anger level he said 
ive got a lot of friends today who have known me since before 
vietnam family members he says they can see a big difference 
and they tell me about it 
loren johnson another veteran looked dazed and drawn after his 
helicopter ride but said it had helped 
this time he said i realized the ship coming in wasnt 
carrying any wounded or dead

whatever the outcome of mondays election it will 
be remembered for the remarkable resurgence of liberal party leader 
john turner and his relentless attack on the free trade agreement 
with the united states 
turner lambasted for increased deficits when he was finance 
minister and hiring goofs during a 79day stint as prime minister 
has struck campaign pay dirt with an attack that portrays canada as 
a us colony if the trade deal passes 
his forceful charge to prime minister brian mulroney during a 
televised debate you sold us out invigorated a flagging 
liberal campaign and set the tone for its final days 
turners nightmare vision of a weakened canada has catapulted the 
liberals into a dead heat with mulroneys progressive conservative 
party according to polls 
on thursday turner told voters the deal would let united states 
overwhelm canada and turn it into a branch plant 
only a conservative majority government now will ensure that the 
trade agreement starts jan 1 as scheduled the agreement is to 
phase out all remaining tariffs between the two countries over a 
10year period 
the socialist new democratic party expected to finish third 
monday also opposes the trade agreement mulroney signed with 
president reagan in january 
the 1988 campaign already stands in sharp contrast to 1984 when 
the conservatives devastated the opposition to win 211 of the house 
of commons 282 seats the liberals with turner at the helm fell 
from the 147 seats they won in 1980 to 40 
in 1984 turner inherited the liberal party leadership from 
pierre trudeau and served as prime minister through the election it 
was the secondshortest term as prime minister ever in canada 
he was depicted as a fumbler for handing out patronage 
appointments at the wrong time a book about turner reign of 
error by ottawa journalist greg weston has been a best seller 
throughout the campaign 
but turner survived three internal challenges since the 1984 
election to stay on at the top of the liberal party 
turner 59 was born in england but came to canada as a child 
his parents were an english journalist and a canadian miners 
daughter 
he first ran for parliament in 1962 and in 1972 was promoted by 
trudeau to finance minister 
his conservative opponents delight in calling him the father of 
the canadian deficit for in three years as finance minister 
government spending soared 80 percent and the deficit quintupled to 
54 billion 
how are you going to pay for it hecklers shout to his 
campaign promises 
the weekly macleans reported that the liberal decision to focus 
on free trade was made in early october when mulroney seemed headed 
for an easy victory 
in campaign stops now turner refers to the pact as the issue 
of the century for our country 
this election is a referendum on canadas future he says 
the liberal leader argues that the free trade agreement can 
affect canadas extensive social and health care programs 
he insists his message is not antiamerican and that relations 
with the united states wont be disrupted if canadians decide 
against proceeding with the trade agreement 
i am saying that the americans are realists they are 
pragmatists he was quoted as saying they are not only our 
largest customer we are their largest customer

president reagan has received a report from the 
pentagon listing options for a military response to the soviet 
unions refusal to destroy a disputed siberian radar facility the 
white house said friday 
no decisions on the matter have been made however and the 
options will not be publicly disclosed added b jay cooper a white 
house spokesman 
the department of defense has submitted a report to the white 
house thats being reviewed now cooper said it was submitted 
on monday 
according to other administration sources who requested 
anonymity options in the report include such things as reversing 
the planned dismantling of three us poseidon missilefiring 
submarines deploying a limited ballistic missile defense and 
speeding up the testing of space weapons 
the washington post reported in friday editions that defense 
secretary frank c carlucci had ordered the report forwarded to 
reagan without endorsing any of the options as desirable primarily 
because of their cost 
the administration has accused the soviets of violating the 
antiballistic missile treaty of 1972 by constructing a radar 
facility near krasnoyarsk siberia that could be used to organize a 
defensive system to protect the soviet union against missile attack 
the theory behind the abm treaty is that if both sides are unable 
to mount a defense they will hesitate to launch an attack 
otherwise their territory and populations will be open to 
devastating retaliation 
the soviets deny violating the treatys terms but have proposed a 
number of plans that they claim will ensure the krasnoyarsk facility 
is used only for peaceful purposes 
the reagan administration continues to insist that the radar be 
torn down the white house requested the military options report 
from the pentagon last summer when the soviets rebuffed that demand 
asked friday if the united states were considering halting 
further negotiations over the matter cooper said the report is 
being reviewed now and those decisions have yet to be made so i 
dont want to speculate i wouldnt speculate on any options

a b1b bomber crashed and burned on a 
runway at ellsworth air force base in the second accident involving 
one of the longrange strategic jets in nine days officials said 
today the crew of four parachuted to safety 
the 280 million bomber apparently clipped utility wires as it 
came in for a landing about 1040 pm thursday said an air force 
official in washington speaking on condition of anonymity 
a witness said an engine was on fire before the crash but 
pentagon sources in washington said investigators were discounting 
such reports 
the crew ejected from the plane officials said one crew member 
may have suffered a minor concussion and another had a possible back 
injury said sgt tony evans a base spokesman the other crew 
members were unharmed he said 
the plane was on a routine training flight the air force said 
the crash came two days after officials reported that the air 
force had inspected and cleared more than twothirds of the 98 b1b 
bombers which were grounded following a crash nov 8 that destroyed 
one of the planes in texas 
air force officials today ruled out any connection between the 
crashes thursday and nov 8 and will not ground the fleet a second 
time pentagon sources said 
it was 25 degrees fog dew point 21 degrees unfortunately it 
looks like they clipped wires a pentagon official said of 
thursdays crash fog may have contributed to the accident but 
the weather was within minimum safety standards the source said 
a witness dale landreth told radio station kota today the 
engine was on fire before it hit the ground while police lt fred 
brown said the plane may have come in too low and hit a utility pole 
the crash thursday was the fourth in the four years since the 
united states began flying b1 aircraft the nations first new 
longrange bomber in more than 25 years 
brig gen robert marquette commander of the 12th air division 
at ellsworth today said statistics will prove that it is a safer 
airplane than previous bombers weve had at this point in the 
maturity process 
maj temple black in washington said a board of officers will 
investigate 
the longrange bomber built by rockwell international is designed 
to fly at high speed and low altitude and deliver nuclear weapons 
asked whether the bomber today was carrying nuclear weapons 
evans said it is air force policy to neither confirm nor deny their 
presence anywhere 
todd heinle a police officer in nearby box elder said that it 
was cloudy at the time of the crash and that he did not notice any 
fog he said he was a halfmile to a mile away and heard the plane 
make a weird noise 
it almost sounded like the plane was trying to increase in 
power he said he said he and a fellow officer saw the wings tilt 
one way and then the other then the lights in the plane went out 
it was just a split second after the lights went out there was an 
explosion and the flames started to come up 
heinle said he could not say whether the explosion occurred while 
the plane was in the air 
harold morgenstern manager of a trailer court said it felt 
like an earthquake morgenstern said he saw about a halfmile of 
flames a couple hundred feet into the air 
last week a b1b crashed and burned in a field near dyess air 
force base in west texas the crew of four ejected and survived 
the air force refused to speculate on the cause of the texas 
crash although witnesses reported a fire around the two left 
engines before the crash sacs grounding order mandated inspection 
of electric fuel and hydraulic lines 
in addition to ellsworth and dyess the bombers are deployed at 
grand forks air force base nd and mcconnell air force base kan 
the air force has been criticized for its handling of the b1b 
program primarily because of acknowledged problems in developing 
its radarjamming gear the service insists the plane is the best 
longrange bomber in the world 
the b1 originally was killed in 1977 by president carter but 
reagan reversed that decision four years later and approved the 
purchase of 100 b1s for a total of 273 billion rockwell has 
built all 100 
reagan said the plane was needed to replace the aging b52s in 
the nations longrange bomber arsenal until the stealth bomber 
becomes available

thierbach by 867 votes after absentee ballots were counted said

objections of orange county republican central committee chairman 
thomas fuentes according to fuentes and pringles campaign manager 
marcia gilchrist

however the guards were hired by the county gop organization

people not legally able to vote 
and fuentes had initially said he took responsibility for the 
polling program which has been condemned by both democratic and 
republican leaders

party chairman john hanna after initially taking some of the 
responsibility hes been shocked at what many of us see is the

democratic party officials trying to avoid a 
leadership fight of their own friday denounced presidentelect 
george bushs choice for republican party chairman as a practitioner 
of a pit bull style of politics 
if lee atwater is going to be the next republican chairman i 
think we know what the next election cycle is going to look like 
said texas democratic party chairman robert slagle 
atwater managed the bush presidential campaign against democrat 
michael dukakis many democrats blame him for the negative tone of 
the republican campaign 
we are ready to take on lee atwater and those who would create 
a pit bull style of politics said rick wiener the michigan 
democratic party chairman 
the choice of atwater gave the democrats a chance to lash out at 
a republican instead of each other as they met for the first time 
after their fifth defeat in the last six presidential elections 
the occasion was a meeting of the association of state democratic 
chairs and the principal order of business was not on the agenda 
it was to convince paul g kirk jr to serve a second fouryear term 
as national party chairman 
keep kirk read big red and white buttons worn by many state 
party officials 
the chairman sounding reluctant to stay on for another term has 
said he would listen to appeals from party officials before making 
his final decision 
at least five party activists including three former 
congressmen intend to run for the job if kirk decides not to stay 
one of them former rep james stanton of ohio wore a keep 
kirk button and told reporters if hes a candidate i support 
him if hes not im a candidate 
stanton was the least wellknown contender in a field that 
included wiener former party official ron brown and former reps 
michael barnes of maryland and jim jones of oklahoma 
brown was convention manager for jesse jackson and much of the 
opposition to him appeared based on his tie to the longtime civil 
rights leader 
following material embargoed for 345 pm est

kirk warned the democrats not to rush to pick up sides and 
divide among ourselves region against region left against right 
constituency against constituency 
despite bushs 40state victory in the presidential election 
kirk said there is no republican majority in americas city halls 
or its legislative bodies there is no republican majority of 
governors 
there is no republican house there is no republican senate 
there is no republican realignment and there is no republican 
mandate 
he urged his party to take prudent stock of the factors that 
might have improved our chances in this election we should not 
oversimplify but we must not overreact 
should we fall into the trap of thinking we must change 
everything weve done in order to win the next presidential 
election i say no

it was funny for a while musclebound 
athletes at the university of central florida gym frightened by 
divebombing bats that everybody said were harmless 
but when one of the bats died tests showed it had rabies 
thirteen people have begun a series of rabies shots because of 
their handling or otherwise coming into contact with the 
sparrowlike 1ounce bats or their droppings the series of five 
shots is administered over 28 days 
several workers said thursday that the gym is still infested with 
bats 
university and orange county health officials are looking for 
anyone else who came in contact with the hundreds of creatures that 
fluttered in and out of the gym building for weeks after being 
displaced in late october from their nests in its ceiling 
officials stressed that chances are remote of contracting rabies 
an infectious disease of the central nervous system characterized by 
choking convulsions and inability to swallow liquids 
just the same we dont take chances with rabies said howard 
schwadron environmental health director for the county health 
department 
the bat that died had been injured and was being cared for by an 
unidentified student 
we havent had these bats attacking people and biting them or 
scratching them said dr john langdon ucf health center 
director these bats arent aggressive at all its peoples own 
recklessness 
because bats lick their skin much the way cats do their fur can 
get wet with rabiesinfected saliva and thats why county officials 
advised the student and maintenance workers who had handled the 
injured creature to get the shots

five years after a surgeon removed a supposedly 
inoperable brain tumor and sent a new york city boy home to a normal 
life the 13yearold has survived another frightening diagnosis and 
a second round of surgery his doctor said friday 
i would describe tom as very courageous said dr george 
dorhmann hes been through more in his 13 years than most people 
go through in their lifetime a very deep dangerously removed 
tumor and hes been through this the scare of a tumor thats 
going to grow and make him paralzyed 
i would say he is someone whos handled all of this as well as 
most people would be able to do 
what doctors first feared was another lifethreatening tumor 
turned out to be a herniated disc in thomas biesiadeckis lower 
back and the boy is on the mend again after a successful operation 
at the university of chicago medical center 
im thankful that god gave him back to me a second time 
barbara biesiadecki thomas mother said shortly before he was sent 
home friday 
no one was more relieved than thomas who after reaching the 
important fiveyear medical milestone had finally stopped fearing 
his brain tumor would reappear his mother said he even had a party 
to celebrate 
but then the pain returned thomas first noticed an ache in his 
stomach while delivering newspapers one day in september doctors in 
new york thought it was a pulled muscle mrs biesiadecki recalled 
and she made him quit his paper route 
but the pain persisted radiating to his back and down his leg 
an xray showed a mass in his lower back mrs biesiadecki said 
doctors fearing another tumor told thomas and his family that 
radiation therapy should be started 
he was very upset mrs biesiadecki said his only thought 
was that it was back again i think the worst part of seeing my 
son sick aside from the pain he was in was seeing how sad and 
empty he was 
but she refused to accept defeat 
the family had consulted doctors first in 1983 when thomas began 
suffering memory lapses and headaches the doctors diagnosed an 
inoperable tumor growing deep inside his brain 
but mrs biesiadecki learned through a newspaper article about a 
doctor in chicago who performed brain surgery with ultrasound a 
procedure using highfrequency sound she contacted the doctor 
dohrmann at the university of chicago and he operated on thomas a 
short time later 
a noncancerous marblesized tumor was removed and the operation 
was declared a success 
followup brain scans showed no recurrence and thomas was 
considered normal except for a related learning disability that has 
put him a couple of grades behind his peers his mother said 
mrs biesiadecki turned once again to dohrman befo2e consen4ing 
to radiation for thomas back problem 
i said with that location theres no question with modern 
techniques we could get just a piece of this tumor dohrmann said 
recalling a phone conversation with the family 
but after looking at the boys xrays dohrmann decided thomas 
didnt have a tumor after all instead he found a disc herniation 
a condition that is not unusual in adults but is rare in children 
he said 
discs are the cushionlike tissue between each vertebra that give 
the back its mobility in thomas case the jellylike material 
inside one of his discs was pushing on sensitive nerves dohrmann 
explained 
he said the problem was unrelated to thomas tumor 
disc fragments were removed in a fairly uncomplicated operation 
nov 9 now thomas prognosis is excellent dohrmann said 
the diagnosis was a miracle to the biesiadecki family 
i just think that something must be very special about thomas 
that this happened to him a second time mrs biesiadecki said 
we cant wait to go home

the national association of broadcasters on 
friday charged that a drunken driving workshop coordinated by the 
surgeon generals office has a builtin bias against beer and wine 
advertising 
the nab in a letter to surgeon general c everett koop said 
many members of the workshop panels are strong opponents of beer and 
wine ads 
the panels are stacked against those groups most affected by 
any recommendations nab said 
the workshop billed as part of the health and human services 
departments initiative against alcoholrelated problems is 
scheduled to take place dec 1416 in washington it is sponsored by 
the departments of health and human services defense education 
justice and transportation 
hhs said the purpose of the workshop was to develop a 
comprehensive plan to bring drunk driving under control and to 
eliminate it as the leading cause of death among young americans 
the nab which opposes a prohibition on beer and wine 
advertising said it was invited to participate in a panel on 
advertising and marketing but nab president edward o fritts 
told koop the group would not participate unless your plans are 
significantly reshaped to include all legitimate points of view 
jim brown a spokesman for koop said the office was preparing a 
formal response to nabs complaints but he said in setting up 
the workshop we tried to involve people from all areas in the 
problem of drunk driving including advertising agencies and sports 
complexes he declined however to list the participants of the 
advertising panel 
nab said however that most of the 10 people it was told would 
be on the advertising panel oppose or have indicated concern about 
beer and wine advertising missing from their list of panel 
participants are major league sports sporting arenas the alcohol 
beverage industry advertising agencies individual broadcast 
stations and the broadcast networks nab said 
nab also said workshop organizers rejected panelists from groups 
that support radio and tv antidrunk driving public service 
campaigns and oppose the outright ban of responsible beer and wine 
advertising 
besides advertising and marketing a draft of the workshop plan 
includes panels on data collection education legal issues 
enforcement alcoholservice policies injury control youth 
treatment and citizen advocacy 
in his letter fritts said that as presently constructed the 
workshop would not contribute to the discussion on drunken driving 
at best this workshop is designed to politicize the emotional 
tragedy of drunk driving at worst it is a total abuse of the 
policysetting process he said

may south africa made agreement on a cuban withdrawal a 
precondition for implementing independence plans for southwest 
africa or namibia a territory pretoria has ruled for 73 years

government in luanda to share power since shortly after angola 
gained independence from portugal in 1975

presidentelect george bush moved friday to 
bolster his relationship with a congress that could prove testy in 
coming months as he also reached out to governors and worked to 
fill jobs on his economic team 
in the face of a volatile economic climate that has seen declines 
in the stock market and a plunge in the dollars value abroad bush 
reiterated friday that he plans to round out his economic 
appointments soon and then move on to name his national security 
team 
after a weekend out of the public eye bush also plans to meet 
monday with former presidents ford and carter said sources close to 
the presidentelect 
anticipating what many observers say will be a short 
honeymoon before congress begins to stand up to the bush white 
house on taxes and other issues bush and his newly named chief of 
staff new hampshire gov john sununu met for lunch friday with 
house speaker jim wright 
afterward wright dtexas sounded a hopeful note for a working 
relationship telling reporters that bush will have closer relations 
with congress than did president reagan 
he said bush is quite earnestly interested in the realities of 
the deficit which is likely to be a bone of contention 
especially given bushs campaign vow not to raise taxes to cut the 
federal budget deficit 
bush on entering the meeting also expressed hopes for good ties 
telling reporters i meant it when i said i want to work closely 
with him and members of the house of representatives no matter 
which side of the aisle they sit on i want to get off to a very 
good start 
sununu said bush would communicate directly with congress to 
address the deficit 
i think congress and the president are going to work 
aggressively and quickly to deal with that issue sununu said on 
abctvs good morning america program 
bushs transition press secretary sheila tate said the speaker 
had telephoned bush for a meeting indicating he would come to the 
vice presidents office 
but according to tate bush offered to go to capitol hill 
instead as a gesture of him being willing to cooperate and work 
with congress 
it showed he was willing to come halfway rather than 
asking me to go down to the white house wright said in 
acknowledging hte symbolism 
in what bush called another symbolic step friday the 
presidentelect met with a group of 18 governors and governorselect 
in charlottesville va 
he said the purpose was to send an early signal to the 
governors and the states of my interests in working with the 
governors democrats and republicans alike 
virginia gov gerald baliles said the discussion ranged over the 
deficit environment wetlands policies education catastrophic 
health coverage and the national economic commission established by 
congress to make recommendations on budget issues 
bush told the group he would name his two appointees to the 
bipartisan commission in early december said iowa gov terry 
branstad 
asked when to expect more decisions on staff and cabinet 
appointments bush told reporters to stay tuned 
bushs announcement on thursday of sununu as chief of staff and 
longtime political strategist lee atwater as his choice for chairman 
of the republican national committee was followed by the selection 
of two of bushs key campaign strategists for sununus staff 
they are ed rogers 29 atwaters righthand man in the bush 
campaign and former deputy political director in the reagan white 
house and andrew card jr former special assistant to the 
president for intergovernmental affairs who served as a senior 
adviser to the bush campaign 
card 41 is widely mentioned as a possible 1990 gubernatorial 
candidate in massachusetts aides to democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis credited him with finding and exploiting some of the 
most politically damaging material that contributed to dukakis loss 
meanwhile former bush campaign press spokesman mark goodin has 
been tapped to serve at the rnc under atwater as director of 
communications 
as for his next staff and cabinet appointments bush said he will 
flesh out the economic side of the house after asking nicholas 
brady to remain as treasury secretary and then start working on 
national security 
it was anticipated bush next week would name former deputy 
treasury secretary richard darman to head the office of management 
and budget 
another possible announcement would be stanford university 
economist michael j boskin as chairman of the council of economic 
advisers 
the economic front is considered important in light of bad news 
in the international financial world since bushs election the 
stock market fell and the dollar dropped in value with many 
analysts questioning whether bush can cut the us trade and budget 
deficits 
brady said on nbctvs today show friday that he does not 
agree that the shaky stock market and dollar show a lack of 
confidence in bushs ability to overcome the deficit 
the bush deficitreduction plan which is called a flexible 
freeze will work im confident that things will work out just 
fine he said

the soviet union on friday recognized the 
proclamation of an independent palestinian state in a careful 
gesture to its arab allies that kept alive recent overtures to 
israel 
faithful to the fundamental principle of freedom of choice the 
soviet union recognizes the proclamation of the palestinian state 
first deputy foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh told a news 
briefing 
he said the soviet union believes a comprehensive settlement of 
the arabisraeli conflict will lead also to the practical 
completion of the historic process of creating this state 
the statement appeared to signal continued soviet support for the 
palestine liberation organization without alienating israel by 
extending full diplomatic relations to the plo 
czechoslovakia issued a similar statement later that also stopped 
short of recognizing the palestinian state while east germanys 
staterun news agency said that communist nation had given 
recognition to the state 
havana radio announced cuban recognition with the statement 
cuba which always supports the just battle of the palestinian 
people for their rights expresses its support for the palestinian 
state 
israeli leaders did not publicly comment on moscows move except 
to say it seemed unclear but senior officials privately expressed 
satisfaction that moscow had stopped short of outright recognition 
the statement was subject to varying interpretations in moscow 
musa mubarak spokesman for the plo office in moscow said the 
statement meant the opening of full diplomatic ties he said the plo 
would be considered like any other government in moscow 
the plo has maintained an office in moscow since 1976 
foreign ministry spokesman boris savastyanov said the statement 
did not entail full diplomatic ties or exchange of diplomats 
that requires additional work he said adding that he could 
not speculate on when such changes would occur 
bessmertnykh asked if the announcement amounted to recognition 
of the palestinian state said in essence it did 
a western diplomat in moscow who specializes in middle east 
affairs said the soviet union was under a lot of pressure from the 
palestinians and their arab allies to recognize the new state 
i think its a way of slipping out of it said the diplomat 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in washington a state department official said privately they 
really havent gone as far as the others on recognition i think the 
soviets traditionally have been rather conservative i think they 
are making a bow to the plo without going as far as the others in 
recognizing the plo they want to appear they are supporting them 
without boxing themselves in 
the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature proclaimed statehood tuesday at its conference in 
algiers algeria 
the move came as the soviet union pursues a gradual thaw in 
relations with israel moscow broke ties with jerusalem in 1967 
after israel captured arab lands in the middle east war it has 
supported the plo and called for israel withdrawal from the occupied 
lands 
under mikhail s gorbachevs leadership moscow and jerusalem 
have exchanged lowlevel delegations and the soviet union has 
loosened some restrictions on jewish emigration 
nevertheless moscows lack of ties with israel freezes the 
soviets out of a more influential role in the middle east like that 
of the united states 
the soviets support arab demands for a unsponsored middle east 
peace conference such a forum also would be a way for the soviets 
to increase their influence in the region 
bessmertnykh praised the palestinians for accepting un 
resolution 242 which implicitly recognizes israel 
the palestinian leadership has displayed a great deal of 
responsibility and realism bessmertnykh said they have 
provided for the creation of their state but at the same time have 
stressed the importance of a middle east settlement 
a situation is shaping where all the sides directly involved in 
the conflict recognize that the path to peace lies through talks 
on the basis of security council resolutions 242 and 338 and that a 
jewish and arab state have equal rights to exist in palestine 
east germanys staterun adn news agency said a foreign ministry 
official delivered a note friday recognizing the palestinian state 
to plos accredited ambassador in east germany isam kamel salem 
the note was delivered by heinzdieter winter deputy minister 
for foreign affairs the agency said 
other nations that have recognized the palestinian state are 
afghanistan algeria bahrain bangladesh cuba cyprus gambia 
india indonesia iraq jordan kuwait lebanon libya madagascar 
malaysia mauritania morocco nicaragua north and south yemen 
qatar pakistan saudi arabia senegal singapore sudan tunisia

since the 5800strong force was deployed in south lebanon in 1978 
israel held onto the 6to10mile deep security zone when it 
withdrew most of its forces from lebanon in june 1985 after a 
threeyear occupation 
israel contends that the enclave which overlaps with unifils 
operating area in south lebanon serves as a buffer against 
crossborder guerrilla attacks into northern israel 
in another development in southern lebanon on friday palestinian 
guerrillas attacked an israeli army post with rockets and automatic 
fire and a security source said one guerrilla was wounded 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said a fierce

rampant inflation fueled by war and 
natural disaster forced nicaragua to issue banknotes and coins of 
higher value friday the government said 
unofficial estimates put the annual inflation rate at 10000 
percent there is no official rate 
the fiscal deficit produced by the war and aggravated by 
hurricane joan and accelerated devaluations have influenced the 
issue of money barricada the official newspaper of the ruling 
sandinista party said thursday 
the new 5000cordoba note issued friday worth 250 is five 
times as large as the biggest bill that was in circulaton barricada 
also said a new 500cordoba coin worth about 25 cents was being 
issued 
when it was first issued in february as part of a massive 
devaluation the 1000cordoba note was worth 100 today it is 
worth 50 cents 
the leftist sandinistas inherited a bankrupt nation when they 
took power in a 1979 revolution dictator anastasio somoza took most 
of the money in the treasury with him when he was ousted 
the economy has been further battered by seven years of war with 
the us backed contra rebels president daniel ortega says the war 
has cost nicaragua 12 billion in direct and indirect costs such as 
lost production and export earnings 
hurricane joan dealt nicaragua another blow when it swept ashore 
oct 22 destroying homes crops ranches bridges and roads and 
leaving tens of thousands homeless ortega has said the storm caused 
828 million in damage 
the political opposition claims many of the economic problems 
stem from sandinista corruption and mismanagemant 
the government issued a series of new bills last year that went 
up to 50000 cordobas which at the time was worth about 2 
the currency was discontinued in february and the cordoba was 
devalued to a rate of 10 to the dollar 
the official rate for the cordoba on thursday was 2000 to the 
dollar the rate used for imports was 500 to the dollar

rusty wallace still hoping to overtake bill 
elliott in the battle for the winston cup title buried the atlanta 
international raceway qualifying record friday as he took the pole 
for the seasonending atlanta journal 500 
wallace drove his pontiac grand prix to a fast lap of 179499 
mph well above the previous track mark of 176623 set in march by 
geoff bodine in qualifying for the motorcraft 500 
that sizzling lap on the newlypaved 1522mile highbanked oval 
also was more than 2 mph faster than the 177125 mph turned in by 
wallaces closest pursuer and close friend dale earnhardt in a 
chevrolet monte carlo 
i should have gone a little faster in turns one and two said 
earnhardt the twotime defending winston cup champion but were 
ready right now the car is good enough to race 
seven driver bettered the old record on friday in nearly perfect 
weather conditions sunny cool and nearly windless 
brett bodine geoffs younger brother was third at 177177 
followed by mike alexander at 177125 ricky rudd at 177068 geoff 
bodine at 176880 and ken schrader at 176794 
fiftyone cars made onelap qualifying efforts on friday with 
the top 20 locking in starting spots for sundays 500mile race the 
rest of the 40car field will be filled in another session of time 
trials on saturday 
one of the drivers still trying to earn a starting position is 
elliott who was a disappointing 22nd on friday at 174452 
the dawsonville ga driver is the defending champion in this 
race and had started no worse than 10th here in 16 races dating back 
to november 1980 
elliott who will clinch his first winston cup championship 
sunday if he finishes 19th or better no matter what wallace does 
said his poor qualifying effort on what he considers his home track 
surprised him 
i dont know what happened but i was only a second off rustys 
time elliott said it could have been worse 
starting in the middle of the pack can be tough because you 
never know whats going to happen back there he added but you 
can have a flat tire at the start of the race and wind up back 
there too thats just something you have to deal with in the 
race 
wallace who knows his only chance to overcome elliotts 79point 
lead going into sundays race is to do well and have the leader 
falter said basically i think were ready to go we tested here 
til we wore everything out last week 
we know weve got to do everything we want to win the pole 
lead every lap win the race and then stand back and see where we 
stand 
also among the drivers failing to qualifying among the top 20 on 
friday were benny parsons and cale yarborough a pair of former 
winston cup champions who have announced their retirement as drivers 
following this event

the government agreed friday to not send 
13 cuban detainees back to their homeland until after their 
attorneys have a chance to study administrative files in washington 
we shouldnt deport anybody until we get the records should 
we asked us district judge uw clemon at an informal hearing 
on a request for a preliminary injunction against the justice 
department 
the request for a restraining order claimed the cubans had been 
denied political asylum without a full or adequate opportunity to 
establish their persecution claims it claimed they were entitled 
to a hearing before an immigration judge 
if deported to cuba they will suffer irreparable harm 
lawyers leo ochoa and robert l boyer of miami said in their request 
assistant us attorney george c batcheler promised that no 
deportation efforts will be made until the records arrive 
clemon postponed the hearing indefinitely 
well wait until we are notified by the us attorney that the 
records have arrived said leo ochoa an attorney for the cubans 
were not in as big a hurry as the government 
the 13 are among 110 deportable cubans at the federal 
correctional institution at talladega about 60 miles east of 
birmingham they were among 125000 people who came to the united 
states from mariel cuba in 1980 in the socalled freedom 
flotilla boatlift many of them had criminal records or mental 
illness 
the government served notice thursday on 15 cubans at talladega 
that they would be deported within 72 hours the 15 have been 
convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to firstdegree murder 
the justice department said in a statement 
ochoa said two of the 15 had not asked him to represent them 
threemember repatriation review panels set up by the jstice 
department have reviewed the cases of 28 cubans and recommended that 
the 15 be returned home the panels were created after last years 
prison riots by cuban detainees at atlanta and oakdale la 
triggered by an agreement with cuban president fidel castro to 
resume sending many of the detainees home 
the review panels will make further reviews of the remaining 13 
of the 28 to determine if they should be deported or released 
at miami meanwhile members of the cuban community appealed to 
president reagan to block the deportation 
rafael penalver who heads a task force aimed at protecting the 
detainees asked the reagan administration to consider the wishes of 
some of its staunchest supporters 
in the waning days of the reagan presidency we are making an 
appeal to the president not to leave as one of his legacies the 
commencement of the deportation process of cuban exiles to fidel 
castros hands penalver said 
penalver said the prisoners have completed their sentences and 
are being unjustly deported only because they arrived on the mariel 
boatlift 
the immigration and naturalization service has released on parole 
about 2400 of 3822 detainees another 400 have been approved for 
parole and are awaiting release said ins spokesman duke austin

the glitter of a bygone era is reemerging from 
the dust and neglect of time as the fox theater reopens saturday 
singers smokey robinson billy eckstein and hall amp oates will be 
featured in a show saturday celebrating the reopening of the theater 
that underwent 81 million in restoration work 
the count basie orchestra magician harry blackstone and 
detroitborn comedian dave coulier also will perform in the 
5100seat theater that was called a temple of amusement when it 
first opened in 1928 
im amazed that weve taken the fox this far said ray 
shepardson a theater consultant it not only looks like 1928 it 
is 1928 
in the theaters early years a childrens dancing school was run 
from the fox and promoter bennie davis ran a talent revue nightly 
from the huge stage 
shows at 2 am were held during world war ii for the nightshift 
workers at war plants and dean martin and jerry lewis performed six 
shows a day during a stint at the fox in 1951 
but in the following years the prestige of the fox began 
slipping and the building began having problems while the fox 
remained structurally sound its roof leaked the carpeting was 
badly worn and electrical systems needed improvement 
all that has been fixed and new owner mike ilitch is putting 
headquarters for his little caesar international pizza company in a 
10story office building next to the fox in downtown detroit the 
theater and office building are expected to key a major 
redevelopment of the area 
inside the theater marblelooking pillars actually are plaster 
gold on sculptures actually is aluminum and the carpet patterns are 
injected rather than woven in 
but that doesnt bother a lot of people 
who cares that the fox is all fake and fraud said audley 
grossman curator of performing arts at the detroit institute of 
arts its truly a palace with a sense of opulence and fun

differences with france and the soviet union 
have upset us plans to begin talks this year between nato and the 
warsaw pact on reducing nonnuclear forces in europe a senior 
reagan aministration official said friday 
the dispute with france concerns whether european governments 
outside the two alliances should play a significant role in troop 
reduction decisions 
france insists on a 35nation review in 1992 which might lead to 
a suspension of negotiations between the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the warsaw pact if governments outside the 
alliances were dissatisfied with the results 
the disagreement with the soviet union is over us conditions 
for a human rights conference the soviets want to hold in moscow 
these include further easing of restrictions on emigration and 
freeing all political prisoners 
despite progress on both fronts the state department does not 
consider the conditions met 
as a result the senior official said almost certainly the 
negotiations over reducing troops tanks and antiaircraft artillery 
in europe will not open this year 
at one point the reagan administration had hoped the 
negotiations would begin by years end not anymore said the 
official who spoke to a reporter on condition of anonymity 
the negotiations were seen as a way around 15 years of 
unproductive talks between nato and the warsaw pact on troop 
reductions in central europe 
the united states and the soviet union also agreed to expand the 
area to stretch from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains in the 
soviet union 
france which participates in natos political decisions but 
remains outside the alliances military command had wanted all 
european nations to play a role in troop reduction decisions but 
france accepted a compromise last year at a north atlantic council 
meeting in reykjavik iceland that the negotiations be held among 
the 23 members of nato and the warsaw pact within the context of the 
35nation european security conference 
but now the us official said france is insisting that the 35 
countries 33 in europe along with the united states and canada 
meet in 1992 to assess progress in the negotiations 
this raises us concerns that the conference could decide to 
suspend the negotiations 
the dispute with the soviets meanwhile is holding up completion 
in vienna of a review of the helsinki agreement concluded by the 35 
nations in 1975 it provided for a freer exchange of people and 
ideas across the eastwest divide while not interfering with the 
postwar boundaries that gave the soviets more authority in eastern 
europe

characterized the conversation as good 
dole is out of the country 
atwater said he plans to launch a program to recruit more blacks

a swarm of microearthquakes and 
discovery of a possible underground pool of molten rock provide 
hints that californias dormant medicine lake volcano might be 
reawakening scientists said friday 
however there is no evidence an eruption is likely us 
geological survey scientists said 
its suspicious enough to put in a new network of seismic 
monitors but not suspicious enough to cause alarm said john r 
evans a seismologist at the agencys western regional headquarters 
if you identify a zone of molten magma beneath a volcano that 
obviously increases the potential for some future activity said 
geologist bob tilling who headed the agencys response to the 1980 
eruptions of mount st helens theres no evidence now for any 
eruption at all the only prudent thing is to keep monitoring it 
the evidence is ambiguous so its premature to suggest it 
represents a reawakening of the volcano said c dan miller a 
geologist with the usgs cascades volcano observatory 
medicine lake volcano is a gently sloped volcano about 20 miles 
in diameter in the southern cascade range about 35 miles northeast 
of mount shasta 60 miles north of lassen peak and roughly 280 miles 
northeast of san francisco medicine lake a recreational lake sits 
at an elevation of 6674 feet on the floor of the volcanos 
fourbysevenmile crater called a caldera 
the nearest town tulelake calif is 25 miles to the northeast 
the volcano last erupted about 850 to 875 years ago forming 
small lava flows and cinder cones around several volcanic vents 
miller said between 1200 and 875 years ago it had several 
explosive eruptions he said 
evans said the recent quakes detection of the possible magma 
chamber and a slight drop in the elevation of the caldera floor in 
recent months may indicate magma is moving inside the mountain but 
miller and evans agreed the quakes also could have been caused by 
nonvolcanic stretching of the earths crust 
the usgs installed six new seismometers after the single previous 
seismometer detected a swarm of about 200 earthquakes sept 29 and 
30 evans said before then only one earthquake in october 1986 
had been detected at the volcano since the agency started monitoring 
in 1981 geologist steve walter said 
the september quakes were shallow and most were microearthquakes 
measuring less than 2 on the richter scale four exceeded magnitude 
3 including one jolt that reached 42 walter said three other 
small quakes occurred oct 26 and nov 11 and 12 he added 
evidence for the small magma chamber just northeast of the lake 
was found by evans and geophysicists h mahadeva iver and phil 
dawson using the shock xwaves of small explosions to make a picture 
of the inside of the volcano 
they found an area in which shock waves moved slowly suggesting 
they had moved through magma evans said however miller said it 
also is possible the waves were slowed by porous rock permeated by 
hot water 
the quakes may have recorded the intrusion of new magma into 
this part of the volcano evans iyer and dawson said in a study 
presented at their agencys geohazards 88 symposium 
the possible magma pool is small measuring only about two cubic 
miles compared with a volume of about 200 cubic miles for the magma 
chamber believed to be beneath the long valley caldera near mammoth 
lakes calif evans said 
walter and evans said usgs scientist dan dzurisin measured the 
elevation of benchmarks on the volcano before the quakes and found 
the mountain had deflated by seven inches since the last 
measurements in 1954 after the september quakes it had fallen an 
additional onethird inch 
such deflation suggests magma may have moved outward into cracks 
in surrounding rocks evans said 
a much higher level of such activity at long valley along with 
much bigger swarms of quakes in the early 1980s failed to result in 
any eruption there miller and tilling said

the lithuanian parliament on friday dropped plans 
to duplicate estonias challenge to moscows authority after a high 
official said estonia was violating the soviet constitution 
official media reported 
the estonian parliament on wednesday passed a declaration of 
sovereignty and a constitutional amendment giving its own parliament 
the right to veto soviet laws 
many people watching the televised session of the lithuanian 
parliament friday believed the lithuanian communist party chief 
algirdas brazauskas said in his speech that moscow had ordered 
estonias parliament to rescind its actions said vitaltas 
kvetkauskas of lithuanian tv in a telephone interview 
but another official vitautas astrauskas appeared on television 
later to say these people had misunderstood the speech kvetkauskas 
continued he declined to speculate whether the deputies also 
misunderstood the speech given by brazauskas a reformer appointed a 
month ago to replace a member of the communist party old guard 
people were scandalized when parliament dropped the 
sovereignty idea without a vote said one activist who had stood on 
the square outside all day listening to the live radio broadcast of 
the parliament meeting 
the man was among those who cheered earlier in the day when 
parliament voted to make lithuanian the official language and the 
flag of independent lithuania the official flag of the soviet 
lithuanian republic 
the people trusted them and then they didnt even vote said 
the activist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said brazauskas returned from moscow the night before the 
meeting and told deputies there was no reason to confront moscow 
when estonia already had lost the battle over sovereignty 
the soviet presidium said thursday that estonias claim of veto 
power over soviet laws conflicted with the soviet constitution and 
that the issue would be discussed with estonian leaders at the next 
meeting of the presidium no date was given 
the three baltic republics of lithuania estonia and latvia were 
independent after the 1917 bolshevik revolution until 1940 they 
then were absorbed by the soviet union under a secret agreement 
between dictators josef stalin of the soviet union and adolf hitler 
of nazi germany that divided eastern europe into spheres of 
influence 
the three republics have been showing signs of resurgent 
nationalism using president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms to push 
for greater autonomy 
estonias president arnold ruutel and premier indrek toome were 
in moscow thursday but said they were attending a longplanned 
meeting on economics 
after brazauskas speech the lithuanian parliament voted 
unanimously to create a commission to rewrite the entire lithuanian

the dollar was a currency just waiting for a 
fall 
when currency traders began a frenzy of greenback selling 
virtually within minutes of george bushs election it appeared they 
suddenly had discovered the presidentelect didnt like taxes and 
may have a tough time shrinking the federal budget deficit 
however strong skepticism about the ability of bush or any 
other politician to address the fundamental causes of the weak 
dollar the federal budget and us trade deficits have been 
present since at least midyear 
the trade imbalance after shrinking dramatically earlier in the 
year appeared to be approaching a new high and there was little 
hope that the next administration whether under bush or democrat 
michael dukakis would offer a realistic plan to reduce the budget 
deficit 
bush in particular appeared to be boxing himself into a corner 
with his read my lips no new taxes pledge 
the real question according to economist michael k evans a 
consultant in washington should be why did the dollar rise for the 
first eight months of this year 
he said the dollar held steady because of traders perception 
rightly or wrongly that the federal reserve and other major central 
banks wouldnt let anything roil the markets and spoil the prospect 
of a republican victory on nov 8 
foreign investors were convinced that up until the election the 
federal reserve would do whatever it takes to keep the dollar 
stable after the election the sentiment among traders was that the 
fed would not intervene heavily so the dollar went down it had 
nothing to do with george bush per se evans said friday 
after the election currency traders began testing to see how 
much of a dollar decline would be tolerated and the initial 
response from central banks and from bush advisers reinforced the 
fall 
the intervention in the market appeared to be rather weak 
traders didnt get what the british call the firm smack of 
policy and suddenly they recognized there wasnt an automatic 
floor under there said robert dederick an economist with 
northern trust co in chicago 
the smack didnt come until the dollar plunged 5 percent 
against the japanese yen and 3 percent against the west german mark 
pulling the us stock and bond markets along with it 
on thursday and continuing friday the federal reserve and 10 
other central banks intervened with heavy and coordinated dollar 
buying the greenback halted its fall on thursday and rose slightly 
friday 
but between the election and thursday confusion reigned 
on the day after the election harvard economist martin 
feldstein a bush adviser restated his often expressed view that 
the dollar must fall 20 percent over the next three years he 
emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not bush but the 
dollar fell after his remarks anyway 
on thursday while commenting on federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspans warning about the ramifications of not cutting the 
budget deficit bush transition press secretary sheila tate said 
economists never agree on anything 
by friday however treasury secretary nicholas f brady was on 
television trying to make calming statements im confident that 
things will work out just fine on the budget deficit he said on 
nbctvs today show 
in milwaukee federal reserve vice chairman manuel h johnson 
speaking at a college conference expressed confidence that the 
dollar did not need to fall in order for the trade deficit to keep 
improving and that central bank intervention was working 
but economists said intervention was a temporary check and they 
listed these other factors in the dollars recent tumble 
dissension on the national economic commission which has been 
charged with adopting a politically acceptable plan to cut the 
budget deficit 
the decline in longterm interest rates from midaugust through 
october lower us interest rates relative to rates in other 
countries make the dollar less attractive 
the point driven home by the election that the us government 
is divided between a democraticallycontrolled congress and a 
republican executive branch making it more difficult to produce a 
deficitreduction plan 
signs of unexpected strength and inflation in economic 
statistics issued over the past two weeks 
according to jerry jordan chief economist of first interstate 
bancorp in los angeles too much economic strength not only 
increases the risk of inflation which makes the dollar a less 
attractive investment it hurts the effort to whittle the trade 
deficit 
a strong economy means more imports and that the trade deficit 
doesnt go down but a weak economy means we can free up some 
resources to produce exports as domestic demand falls off that 
means we get a big drop in the trade deficit and that would 
strengthen the dollar jordan said 
the appointment of new hampshire gov john h sununu as white 
house chief of staff also may be causing concern among currency 
traders sununu was elected governor in 1982 on an antitax 
platform hes said as chief of staff he wont hesitate to offer 
advice to bush on domestic policy 
this guy sununu is going to be important the way he has 
performed suggests hes not going to be very favorable to 
compromising on taxes hell reinforce bushs campaign promises 
jordan said

president reagan on friday signed legislation 
designed to end the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean by 1992 
the bill is aimed at closing the nations last remaining sludge 
dumping site some 106 miles off the new jersey coast 
the only agencies affected by the new legislation are three 
regional sewage authorities in new york including new york city 
and six authorities in northern new jersey 
no other jurisdiction in the nation still dumps its sludge at sea 
under the measure the agencies must end their dumping by dec 
31 1991 or pay stiff penalties amounting potentially to millions 
of dollars 
meanwhile the dumpers will begin next year to pay increased 
fees separate from potential penalties for use of the ocean as a 
dump site 
both the fees and fines if needed will be pooled to help 
develop alternate disposal methods 
reagans signing of the bill without comment climaxes a 10year 
legislative effort to halt the dumping congress voted a first ban 
in 1978 effective in 1981 which was successfully challenged in 
federal court by new york the dumping has continued under court 
authority since 
new york lawmakers and new york mayor edward i koch opposed the 
new measure but ultimately agreed to a compromise in the face of 
mounting congressional pressure 
ocean dumping is one of the most insidious forms of pollution 
ever inflicted on the environment said rep william hughes 
dnj the principal author of the bill after it was signed into 
law 
were taking big strides in our effort to clean up the ocean 
added sen frank lautenberg dnj the chief senate sponsor 
sen john chafee rri said the environmental health of the 
oceans and the economic health of the fishing industry demand that 
we end the dumping

former us rep mario biaggi a hero cop turned 
rogue congressman reasserted his innocence and sought mercy for his 
son friday before he was sentenced to eight years in prison for 
racketeering in the wedtech corruption scandal 
im still of the belief i always have been that i am 
innocent the 10term congressman told us district judge 
constance baker motley before she sentenced him to eight years in 
prison and fined him 242000 
the judge said a prison term was necessary to assure the 
community that the punishment for such crimes upon conviction will 
be certain and substantial 
biaggi 71 in a voice wracked by sobs pleaded with the judge to 
spare his eldest son and codefendant richard from prison 
the worst possible punishment your honor could administer would 
be to put my son in prison said biaggi his eyes brimming with 
tears i appeal to you as a father do what you want with me 
my time is done dont hurt richard 
richard biaggi 39 of fort lee nj took off his glasses 
buried his face in his hands and wept at the defense table during 
his fathers plea 
motley later sentenced the younger biaggi to two years in prison 
and fined him 71000 
the elder biaggi slumped in his chair but showed no emotion while 
motley sentenced him 
prosecutors said afterward that the elder biaggi would be 
eligible for parole after serving 40 months in prison 
despite the emotional turmoil in the courtroom the elder biaggi 
was seen in the hall during a break chatting amiably with relatives 
and even chuckling occasionally 
i think hes upset at the sentence of his son more than 
anything else i think hes upset at whether he himself can fulfill 
his own sentence physically fulfill the sentence said biaggi 
lawyer james larossa 
biaggi a highly decorated city police officer from 1942 to 1965 
was convicted aug 5 of all but one of the 16 counts against him 
including racketeering extortion and mail fraud 
he was accused of turning wedtech corp a defunct south bronx 
defense contractor into a racketeering enterprise that paid out 
millions of dollars in bribes to public officials for help in 
winning nobid contracts 
richard biaggi was acquitted of racketeering charges but was 
found guilty of bribe receiving mail fraud and tax charges 
the elder biaggi left the courtroom without comment after the 
nearly threehour sentencing session he was ordered to surrender to 
authorities on jan 9 
he resigned from office a day after his conviction he already 
has been sentenced to 2 years in prison for obstruction and taking 
an illegal gratuity in an unrelated case 
the most notable recent convictions of members of congress came 
from the abscam investigation which led to the conviction of sen 
harrison a williams of new jersey and six members of the house 
including john m murphy of new york and frank thompson jr of new 
jersey 
biaggi who could have been sentenced to a maximum total sentence 
of 146 years in prison and 7 million in fines was sentenced to 
between two and eight years on numerous counts which motley ordered 
to run concurrently 
the judge said biaggis wedtech sentence would run concurrently 
with the previous one 
but for the defendants age and the state of his health his 
prison term would be substantially longer motley said 
biaggis lawyer noted before sentencing that his client suffers 
from heart problems that require daily medication as well as a 
pronounced limp caused by a leg injury suffered in the line of duty 
as a policeman 
assistant us attorney edward j little told motley that the 
trial evidence showed biaggi is corrupt biaggi took bribes 
and sold out his office for nearly 1 million in fees and 2 million 
in stocks 
in a final plea before sentencing biaggi said the fivemonth 
trial and the month of devastating publicity before his 
indictment were punishment enough 
there wasnt a day i didnt suffer biaggi said i died a 
little bit every day i started to die some time ago 
the judge received some 170 letters urging leniency and 
recounting biaggis many contributions over the years including 37 
from republican and democratic congressmen 
three of the four other people convicted with the biaggis last 
august also were sentenced by motley former bronx borough president 
stanley simon 58 five years and 70000 in fines wedtech founder 
john mariotta 58 eight years 291000 and former small business 
administration official peter neglia 40 three years and 30000 
the sentencing of biaggis former law partner bernard ehrlich 
59 who also was convicted of racketeering was postponed because he 
was previously committed to a hospital after being found incompetent 
to stand trial in a state case a seventh defendant was acquitted on 
all counts

a new vaccine that third world farmers can use 
to save cattle from the infectious disease rinderpest is ready for 
field trials in africa the us agency for international 
development announced friday 
aid administrator alan woods estimated it could prevent losses of 
from 100 million to 250 million a year 
in much of the developing world cattle constitute the 
family savings woods told reporters 
rinderpest is a highly infectious disease that usually kills 
cows buffalo and some other animals in a week or less 
woods said the disease was brought from italy in the late 1930s 
to ethiopia which italian forces then occupied and spread into 
africa and asia it has not been a problem in the united states 
because vaccines already exist 
however use of the vaccines overseas had been restricted because 
the vaccines had to remain refrigerated that often is impossible in 
remote areas of third world countries 
woods said his agency invested less than a million dollars in a 
cooperative venture with the university of california davis to 
produce a vaccine that does not need refrigeration

million sale of its northeast shuttle to real estate magnate donald 
trump 
the motion filed in us district court here by the international 
association of machinists the air line pilots association and local 
553 of the transport workers union had been anticipated for a month 
us district judge barrington parker in october had scheduled a 
hearing on it for dec 2 giving eastern until nov 25 to file a 
response 
the three unions contended in the motion that the sale of the 
bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle violates the railway labor act as 
part of an attempt by easterns parent texas air corp to break 
the unions in the midst of collective bargaining on new contracts 
the sale is yet another attempt by texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo to dismantle eastern airlines said jack bavis head of 
the pilots union at the carrier theyve done nothing but squeeze 
out assets over the last two years the shuttle is one of the 
strongest links in easterns structure 
although the shuttle has been consistently profitable texas air 
contends the sale is necessary to raise cash for preserving the rest 
of eastern which has lost more than 300 million since 1986

lawmakers and insurers clashed friday over a 
voterapproved measure that drastically cuts insurance rates in 
california 
legislators began trying to put down a socalled industry revolt 
while insurance companies defended their decisions to cut back on 
policies they sell 
democratic state sen dan boatwright accused the insurance 
companies of literally screwing the people of the state of 
california following passage of proposition 103 
officials said the insurance companies are not renewing existing 
auto policies refusing new car insurance customers or referring 
them to more expensive subsidiaries 
insurance company representatives said it would be unfair and 
illegal to force them to operate at multimilliondollar losses they 
say they incur under the initiatives rate cuts of at least 20 
percent 
we cannot continue to pay claims deliver service to our 
customers and provide a return to our shareholders under the system 
established by this ballot initiative said ronald foley of the 
travelers corp which is pulling auto home and some commercial 
lines from the market 
the state supreme court is considering the constitutionality of 
proposition 103 and lawmakers summoned industry officials to 
fridays hearing to explain their reaction to the measure 
state senate leader david roberti announced legislation to pay 
for the state insurance commissioners imposition of proposition 103 
and to create an office in the justice department to handle consumer 
complaints about insurers 
sen alan robbins said he planned to introduce legislation dec 5 
to levy multimilliondollar fines against insurers who withdraw from 
the market to avoid complying with the proposition 
robbins said the legislation would require every company to 
retroactively cover all people who held policies on election day and 
would fine insurers between 25 percent and 50 percent of the value 
of every policy not renewed after proposition 103 passed 
boatwright suggested legislation that would forbid companies from 
writing insurance unless they are complying with the measure 
insurance companies filed suit against ratecutting proposition 
103 upon its passage last week claiming that it was 
unconstitutional primarily because it would force them to operate 
at a loss 
the state supreme court temporarily blocked the initiative while 
it considers the challenge for weeks perhaps months 
attorney general john van de kamp earlier this week asked the 
court to lift or at least narrow the ruling so that it blocks only 
the rate rollbacks and allows the balance of the measure that 
includes stiff government regulation of the industry to go into 
effect

security forces two whites and a black were sentenced to death 
friday for the death of a man in a car bomb attack on the african 
national congress 
they were convicted in the death of obert mwanza a jobless 
zambian they recruited to help in the attack mwanza died when the 
explosives were detonated by remote control jan 11 outside a house 
in bulawayo occupied by the anc the main guerrilla group fighting 
white domination in neighboring south africa 
the defendants are kevin woods 35 and michael smith 34 both 
white and phillip conjwayo 54 who is black they were members of 
the security forces in rhodesia a whiteruled british colony that 
in 1980 became zimbabwe with a black majority government 
their sentences will be appealed automatically to the supreme 
court but probably not for a year court officers said 
judge wilson sandura sitting with two civilian assessors in the 
high court said each defendant played a key role in the bombing 
which he said was conducted on behalf of south africa and there no 
extenuating circumstances 
woods belonged to the central intelligence organization security 
police in rhodesia smith was a soldier in the rhodesian light 
infantry and conjwayo served in the rhodesian police special branch 
they pleaded innocent to all charges 
sandura found them guilty of murder under a provision of 
zimbabwes romandutch law allowing guilt through collaboration 
before sentencing woods and smith defended the plot but 
expressed regret that a civilian was killed 
our only motivation was on behalf of the people of south 
africa who suffer mayhem and death nearly on a daily basis at the 
hands of these anc murderers woods said and the countries 
which harbor these murderers must look first to their own 
consciences before pointing the finger at us 
conjwayo said he was framed and tortured by police he admitted 
buying the car where the explosives were placed but said he did not 
know how it would be used 
woods and smith face a further trial on charges along with a 
third man of bombing anc targets in 1986 
after sentencing the defendants were handcuffed to prison

allegations that a cornell university 
graduate student created a virus that jammed a nationwide 
network of computers are being investigated by a federal grand jury 
a prosecutor said 
assistant us attorney andrew baxter confirmed the investigation 
thursday but declined to say when the panel began hearing evidence 
or if anyone had been subpoenaed to testify 
robert t morris jr 23 is suspected of unleashing the virus on 
a computer communication network earlier this month disrupting 
6000 computers nationwide 
morris friends have quoted him as saying he didnt intend any 
harm 
the virus program transmitted copies of itself from computer to 
computer along the internet computer network crashing an estimated 
6000 computers nationwide it also instructed the infected 
computers to make copies of the virus filling memory space and 
keeping the machines busy 
the virus caused at least 97 million in damage because of 
interrupted work on computers that had to be shut down and in the 
work need to resuscitate the computers the director of the computer 
virus industry association said thursday 
our calculations of the damage it caused are very conservative 
the real cost is probably well over 100 million said john 
mcafee computer virus consultant and director of a santa 
clarabased group of 11 companies that markets computer programs to 
fight viral programs 
the analogy there is the cost of conducting a massive search 
for thousands of hidden bombs and then disabling them mcafee said 
just the time that the programmers spent conferring with each 
other either in meetings or over the telephone as they tried to 
share knowledge in combatting the infection was estimated at 
least 12000 hours mcafee said 
no charges have been filed 
the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation to determine if 
statutes on wire fraud malicious mischief or unlawful access to 
stored communications may have been broken the fbi has subpoenaed 
computer tapes and other records at cornells computer science 
department 
baxter declined to say if anyone other than morris is the target 
of the grand jury investigation in syracuse

hundreds of election officials will not 
participate in saturdays balloting in northeastern province because 
they fear attacks by both tamil and sinhalese militants according 
to government sources 
election commissioner chandrananda de silva said the number of 
polling booths had been reduced from 567 to 324 because of the lack 
of staff he said only 300 members of the 2200 people scheduled to 
oversee the voting were available for duty 
he gave no reason why the others would not work but government 
sources speaking with condition of anonymity said violence was 
expected 
the elections are for 35 members of a semiautonomous 
administrative council responsible for governing the tamildominated 
province 
the establishment of such councils was a key part of the 
indiamediated accord signed in july 1987 to end the fiveyearold 
war by tamils demanding their own homeland 
tamils most of whom are hindus accuse the buddhist sinhalese 
majority of discrimination tamils are a majority in northeastern 
sri lanka but comprise only 18 percent of the island countrys 
population of 16 million 
both the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest tamil

a young man accused of strangling his 
bride after a christmas eve argument and leading volunteers on a 
sixday search for her was found guilty friday of seconddegree 
murder 
matthew solomon 22 appeared shaken when the suffolk county jury 
foreman read the verdict he was immediately surrounded by about 20 
court officers 
his father jack stood up and screamed at diane weaver the 
mother of victim lisa solomon you got your pound of flesh 
court officers surrounded him in efforts to calm him but minutes 
later he stormed from the cramped fourrow courtroom yelling 
the lies youve been telling will come out solomons mother 
ruth remained sitting 
but after her son was removed she collapsed in the courtroom 
apparently from an asthmatic attack and was taken by ambulance to 
central suffolk hospital 
outside as mrs solomon was being put into the ambulance the 
defendants father shouted my son is the most decent thing on 
gods earth and now he has been put in a cage 
after the verdict mrs weaver broke into tears and hugged her 
brother and lisas uncle howard klerk 
outside court klerk who has been spokesman for lisas family 
said that despite the verdict we didnt win anything we dont 
have lisa back we lost we dont have our girl 
solomon had been charged with two counts of seconddegree murder 
one intentional and the other showing depraved indifference for 
human life 
the jury found him guilty of the depraved indifference count it 
carries the same maximum sentence as intentional murder 25 years to 
life in prison county court judge harvey sherman set sentencing 
jan 17 
solomon a sheet metal worker has been held without bail since 
his arrest jan 11 
both sides in the case agreed that solomon strangled 22yearold 
lisa his wife of two months during an argument following a 
champagneandlobster dinner in their huntington station apartment 
last christmas eve 
they both agreed that solomon wrapped the body in plastic garbage 
bags dumped her body in a farm field and then led volunteers for 
six days in a search for her 
but the prosecution contended that while solomon did not scheme 
to have his wife murdered he intended to kill her the defense 
claimed solomon accidentally strangled his wife in the heat of an 
argument and that solomons actions afterward were those of a 
panicstricken youth 
the prosecution centered on medical testimony and solomons 
videotaped confession to police 
if matthew solomon had released the choke hold when his wife 
stopped crying or released it when she fell into unconsciousness 
lisa would be alive today prosecutor timothy mazzei told the jury 
mazzei said that solomon lied about his wifes disappearance for 
17 days and only admitted to strangling her when he was confronted 
with evidence linking him to the crime 
solomon had claimed in the confession that he put his wifes neck 
in an armhold to get her to calm down and stop crying during the 
fight he said they were fighting because she wanted to leave and he 
didnt want her to drive because she had been drinking champagne 
defense attorney jeffrey waller tried during the trial to portray 
lisa as a spitfire who had a hot temper especially when she 
drank alcohol 
he referred to them as a immature couple who fell in love got 
married and then had problems which ended in tragedy

prime minister yitzhak shamir said friday he 
seeks a compromise to avoid alienating us jews from israel over 
religious demands that he outlaw nonorthodox conversions to 
judaism a us congressman said 
shamirs remarks to a group of congressmen and american jewish 
fundraisers came after a group representing millions of jews in the 
united states and canada announced at a conference in new orleans 
this week a new offensive against attempts to change the who is a 
jew law in israel 
the group is the council of jewish federations which says it 
represents 95 percent of the 55 million to 6 million jews in north 
america 
all members of the jewish community are considered members of 
the jewish people we do not want to prefer anybody or exclude 
anybody shamir was quoted as saying by rep jim courters rnj 
everyone who considers himself a jew is a jew we are looking 
for a solution a solution that will not give jews in america reason 
to take warning 
courters said shamir did not elaborate 
he said shamir spoke after courters and fundraisers of the 
united jewish appeal told the israeli leader they were concerned 
about the redefinition of who is a jew 
most american jews take exception to it cliff sobel of the 
united jewish appeal delegation told a reporter after the meeting 
harry wall director of the israel office of the antidefamation 
league said he considered shamirs comments a change in shamirs 
earlier assurances to religious parties that the law would be 
changed 
a corner has been turned here toward mitigating this dispute 
this highly emotional issue wall said 
shamir who heads the rightwing likud bloc earlier promised 
four key swing parties of the ultraorthodox bloc that he would 
support their bid to change israels law of return in exchange for 
their support in a governing coalition 
the law of return guarantees citizenship to any jew who 
immigrates the religious parties want the law to disqualify persons 
converted to judaism by nonorthodox rabbis 
most of the american jewish community belongs to nonorthodox 
streams of judaism namely the conservative and reform movements

ask for a recount of votes cast in wyomings tight us senate race 
and conceded the election to incumbent malcolm wallop

approximately 180000 ballots cast

machine problems would be to file a suit with the state against the 
counties and state vinich said i ran for office to serve the 
people of wyoming and not to sue the state 
the issues are more important to wyoming than putting the state 
through that kind of pain

the united states and france disagreed 
friday about frances decision to review nato positions on a new 
forum for conventional arms reduction talks which washington says 
delays progress toward negotiations 
gilles curien of france rejected american and other western 
claims that the french review was blocking progress he leads his 
countrys delegation at the vienna followup conference to the 1975 
helsinki agreements on european security and cooperation 
warren zimmermann chief us delegate said at a news briefing 
we hope the french government is not going to put previous nato 
agreements into question because if there was a question of taking 
another look at those agreements which took us such a long and 
difficult time to reach then i think we would be inevitably forced 
into a long delay at the conference 
in paris president francois mitterrand said france remains 
very open and does not wish to be an obstacle to the immediate 
negotiations it will rather complain of the numerous obstacles 
posed by others so little pressed to discuss these matters 
senior diplomats in east and west had expressed confidence in the 
past week that talks between the 16 north atlantic treaty 
organization and seven warsaw pact countries on a new mandate for 
conventional arms control talks could be concluded this year 
the negotiations are designed to replace the mutual and balanced 
force reduction talks which have dragged on without agreement in 
vienna for nearly 15 years 
current talks involve only seven nato nations and four warsaw 
pact countries and focus on central europe the new talks in 
addition to involving more nations would cover all europe from the 
atlantic to the ural mountains 
informal talks between the 23 member countries of the two 
alliances began in february 1987 as the result of security 
negotiations in the review conference at which the united states 
canada soviet union and all european countries except albania are 
represented 
the vienna meeting is one of several review conferences held to 
review compliance with the helsinki agreements it began in november 
1986 
curien said in a speech to delegates friday that his governments 
decision to review the mandate talks was made because the 
negotiations are a major political preoccupation for europes 
future 
we attach the greatest importance to the fact that military 
affairs should not be separated from other areas of the helsinki 
agreements such as human rights because the whole process 
represents a single and unique idea for europes future he said 
earlier this week a western official told reporters conventional 
arms control is so vital to western security that it should be 
negotiated on its own merits not in relation to other helsinki 
issues 
he said making the talks dependent on future helsinki review 
conferences as france wants could jeopardize the balanced approach 
the west seeks in that forum to the three main issues of security 
human rights and economic cooperation 
curien said the current review in paris grew out of a need for 
clarifications in the conference texts in which certain 
paragraphs are ambiguous or at least they can give rise to various 
interpretations he did not elaborate

women are more likely to become pregnant in 
november than in any other month says a report on fertility 
published friday 
a study of 259 conceptions by artificial insemination at a 
british hospital showed twice as many conceived in november 
december and january as in june or july with the rate peaking in 
november 
results echoed previous findings that natural conceptions peaked 
at about the same time of year said the report published in the 
british medical journal 
seasonal variations in rates of natural conception in women is 
well documented it said the peak lasts from early winter to 
early spring we found that conceptions resulting from artificial 
insemination were similarly distributed 
the study conducted at the jessop hospital for women in 
sheffield northern england looked at the womens conception rates 
in 19741982 
doctors who did the research wrote said in their report that 
seasonal variations in conception had to result from one or more of 
five factors frequency of sexual intercourse rate of ovulation 
quality of semen quality of the egg after ovulation or receptivity 
of the womb lining endometrial receptivity 
frequency of intercourse was irrelevent in this case they said 
because the womens partners were infertile and artificial 
insemination was used the researchers said the ovulation rate was 
unimportant because only confirmed periods of ovulation were 
included in the data 
sperm might have been the key because there was a seasonal 
variation in its quality the authors said but added that the time 
of maximum sperm count and volume was in febuary and march too 
early in the year to produce a november peak in fertility 
by exclusion therefore the report said we suggest there 
is seasonal variation in the quality of the egg or endometrial 
receptivity or both and that the time of highest quality is early 
winter 
it did not say definitively why quality should be higher in early 
winter but suggested it could be linked to the production of extra 
sex hormones which are released in greater quantities in winter 
months 
the doctors who wrote the report said it should speak for 
itself and declined comment they are eftis paraskevaides 
registrar of the gynecology department at north manchester general 
hospital george pennington consultant chemical pathologist at the 
jessop hospital and his assistant sandra naik

blockage affecting the whole east coast 
in addition to affecting phone service several private customers 
using phone line transmissions including the associated press

the disruption in service meant many callers either got a 
recording telling them to dial again or a busy signal said nelson

a threeinch lightguide cable

customers were affected 
the blockage affected people in varying degrees across the 
nation with the effects concentrated on the east coast he said 
the closer you got to the site of the broken cable the more likely 
you were to have trouble completing calls

a federal ban on the food use of livestock 
thyroid glands will take effect dec 15 two years after it was 
officially proposed the agriculture department said friday 
the ban which was proposed on dec 15 1986 also will apply on 
the tissue surrounding the thyroid glands officials said although 
federal regulations still permitted use of the glands and tissue 
federal inspectors had already been instructed to bar their use as 
food 
we have found a connection between consumption of meat 
trimmings containing the thyroid gland and adjacent tissue with 
thyrotoxicosis so we are required to ban its use in food said 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food safety 
and inspection service 
thyrotoxicosis is caused by excessive amounts of thyroid hormones 
in the blood the agency said disease symptoms include 
sleeplessness nervousness increased heart rate shortness of 
breath fatigue excessive sweating and weight loss 
investigations of an outbreak of thyrotoxicocis in minnesota in 
1985 showed that some establishments in trimming laryngeal muscle 
tissue from slaughtered animals were cutting too deeply and 
retaining all or part of the thyroid gland 
thyroid glands were not approved for food use but trimmings from 
the laryngeal muscle were used in products such as ground beef the 
inspection service said 
after the minnesota outbreak federal inspectors were told to 
halt the use of the glands and adjacent tissue further officials 
said the largest meat processors who accounted for about 80 
percent of the use of such beef trimmings voluntarily stopped using 
the muscle tissue for trimmings

the general assembly asked developed 
nations friday to increase aid to africa and to reschedule africas 
huge debt in an effort to save the continents faltering economic 
recovery program 
the assembly adopted by consensus and without a vote a bleak un 
midterm report on african economic recovery from 1986 to 1990 with 
detailed recommendations the 23page report said that 2 years into 
the ambitious un program the picture is grim and little 
improvement has been made 
according to un figures africas total foreign debt was 
estimated at 218 billion by the end of 1987 almost three times 
africas annual export earnings 
per capita income in africa fell 2 percent in 1986 22 percent 
in 1987 and today is lower than it was in 1980 
the report proposed that developed countries allocate 7 percent 
of their gross national product to official development assistance 
to africa 
it also asked subsaharan african nations themselves to pursue 
difficult reforms to make their economies more viable and 
competitive 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar requested the 
international community to make the extra effort in the 
immediate future that will make the crucial difference in successful 
implementation of the program of action 
there is no escaping the close connection between external 
debt financial flows and trade if africas recovery and 
development is to be placed on a solid footing 
the program asks africa to undertake economic reform and 
development and asks the international community to support and 
supplement africas effort it estimated that 1281 billion was 
required for 198690 african countries committed themselves to 
provide 825 billion of this amount with the rest to come from 
other nations and international lending and un institutions 
but midway in the program the situation remains critical 
the situation has not at all improved but it has worsened in 
some countries despite efforts of african countries to restructure 
their economies and despite aid from the international 
communities norways un ambassador tom vraalsen chairman of 
the review committee told a news conference 
other countries must increase their support for african 
countries in the years to come 
vraalsen told the general assembly that in spite of all efforts 
the situation in africa continues to grow worse 
he said it is characterized by unsustainable crushing burdens of 
external debt substantial decline in export earnings because of 
depressed commodity prices decline in private investment lending 
and the like instability of the international currency market and 
abnormaly high interest rates 
vraalsen also said that some african governments committed to 
cutting their budgets cut spending on education and health and cut 
lowerpaying jobs in the bureaucracy instead of higher paying less 
essential jobs 
us ambassador vernon a walters told the assembly the united 
states aids africa but emphasizes the importance of economic reform 
by african nations themselves 
while growth payoffs have not been as rapid or predictable as 
everyone would have liked there has been a clear improvement in 
growth rates among the reforming african countries as a group 
walters said 
the reform path is going to be long and arduous africa is not 
at the end of the reform process but at the beginning if africa 
fails to sustain reform or implements it halfheartedly the 
continent risks repeaitng the decline and depression of the recent 
past 
report recommendations range from greater support for women the 
primary producers in africa to rescheduling the external debt of 
african nations 
nonconcessional officially guaranteed debt and debtservice 
payments of lowincome african countries should be rescheduled on 
more generous terms the report said in one of many 
recommendations on debt loans and credits

a federal court jury friday ordered the 
rhode island state polices two top officers to pay 125000 to a 
woman trooper who was the victim of their harassment sex 
discrimination and retaliation 
trooper mary nunes 25 said she was just really happy that it 
ended this way ecstatic actually the defendants and their 
attorneys refused to comment 
the sevenperson jury which in late october found the state and 
three other defendants liable reached its verdict on damages after 
about 1 days of deliberations 
the state col walter stone the police superintendent maj 
lionel benjamin stones deputy and lt walter reynolds commandant 
of the police training academy were found liable for various counts 
of sex discrimination harassment retaliaton or invasion of privacy 
i didnt really come into this for money and i think my 
victory came last week actually two weeks ago when they found the 
department guilty of harassing women and harassing me that was all 
i really wanted nunes said this money was just lawyers fees 
thats things that have to be done 
nunes claimed during the trial that her problems began during the 
198586 training academy with a physical training program allegedly 
aimed at washing women out of the force 
she said the problems worsened after graduation when stone and 
benjamin ordered investigations into her private life including 
whom she dated a party for offduty officers at her parents home 
and an accident in her private car 
the sevenmember jury awarded only 4 from the defendants to 
compensate her for actual injuries that included 1 to be paid by 
reynolds 
the 75000 award against stone and the 50000 award against 
benjamin was in punitive damages designed to deter any future 
conduct the state apparently will compensate them only for nominal 
damages but not for a punitive award 
the verdict was a remarkable day for rhode island said one 
of nunes attorneys joseph levin who had set out to show that the 
police policies were so outdated they made discrimination almost 
inevitable 
judge ernest c torres has set a monday hearing on motions to 
dismiss the case and from nunes attorneys for nonmonetary damages 
including a possible injunction against future discrimination and 
supervision of the department 
i have no idea what the jury did when they decided this case i 
still dont the case is still going on said 
reynolds lawyer joseph v cavanagh jr claimed that the case was 
an attempt by the fraternal order of police which sued along with 
nunes and still has a case pending to oust stone who has been 
superintendent for 27 years 
reynolds who left the court stonefaced refused to comment 
benjamin said he was disappointed but he and other attorneys 
declined further comment 
stone 77 was not in court and was in a meeting and not 
available to comment said an officer who answered the telephone at 
state police headquarters stone did not return a telephone message 
cavanagh said earlier that he would attempt to pursue an appeal 
the jury found stone liable for 55000 for sexual discrimination 
and harassment 10000 for retaliation against nunes when she 
complained and 10000 for invading her privacy 
benjamin was found liable for 10000 for discrimination and 
harassment and 20000 each for retaliation and invasion of privacy 
stone who makes 103600 a year in salary and a providence 
police pension testified he has about 300000 in assets benjamin 
54 makes 84000 a year testified he has about 175000 in assets 
nunes who thanked the union and her parents for their support 
called it a matter of principal and said she was prepared to 
take the case as far as necessary in the appeals courts it will 
be a battle to the end she said 
the trooper said she would try to stay on the force but if the 
harassment continues from my administrators it depends on how long 
i can take it

more than 90000 ethnic albanians 
rallied throughout kosovo province friday to protest the force 
resignations of two provincial leaders and officials warned the 
demonstrators to go home 
the rally in pristina capital of kosovo province was estimated 
by the state news agency tanjug at 70000 making it the largest 
demonstration ever in kosovo 
at least 22000 other people gathered for rallies in other kosovo 
towns to protest also the continuing pressure from the serbian 
republic for more control over its restive southern province 
belgrade radio and television reported 
the protests set off a flurry of meetings and warnings by 
provincial and federal officials in this communist country 
kosovos acting communist party president remzi koljgeci an 
ethnic albanian went on pristina radio late friday telling 
demonstrators to disperse or we will be forced to undertake all 
measures available under the constitution he did not elaborate 
after his appeal crowds began to break up in pristina 
stefan korosec secretary of the powerful national central 
committee made a similar appeal on national radio and television 
but he did not make any threats 
korosec and interior minister dobroslav culafic head of 
yugoslavias police forces traveled to the province friday to try 
to quell the unrest news reports said 
state television appealed to ethnic albanians who were 
descending on pristina for official celebrations saturday of the 
citys 1944 liberation from the nazis to stay away it said the 
situation was deteriorating 
witnesses said at least 20 trucks filled with riot police were 
seen moving toward pristina indicating a crackdown might be 
imminent 
the national communist partys ruling politburo met in emergency 
session friday evening to discuss the protests 
kosovos leaders discussed the possibility of emergency 
measures in case the so far peaceful protests turn into riots 
an informed source close to the leadership told the associated 
press he spoke on condition of anonymity 
protesters held thousands of portraits of the late yugoslavian 
leader josip broz tito who signed the 1974 constitution granting 
kosovo wide autonomy 
we dont want changes of titos constitution the protesters 
chanted in albanian we will give our lives but we will not give 
up kosovo 
the protests followed the forced resignations thursday of two 
popular kosovo ethnic albanian leaders azem vlasi and kacusa jasari 
the most recent eruption of thnic violence in kosovo was in 1981 
when at least nine people died as about 40000 ethnic albanians 
clashed with police after demanding that kosovo become a 
fullfledged yugoslav republic 
vlasi and jasari have been the main targets of resignation 
demands by serbias communist party chief slobodan milosevic in his 
drive to bring kosovo under tighter serbian control kosovos 
minority serbs and montenegrins mainly christian claim 
discrimination by the predominantly moslem ethnic albanian majority 
vlasi addressed the pristina crowd at a municipal sports stadium 
saying i think this gathering is the reaction to the pressures 
and against ongoing vulgar nationalist hatred at some serbian 
rallies 
milosevic planned to address a mass rally in belgrade on 
saturday it is expected to draw up to 1 million serbs a source at 
belgrade television said 
vlasi who on thursday was forced to leave kosovos 13member 
ruling politburo promised the demonstrators their demands would be 
discussed at another emergency leadership meeting saturday 
dispersing peacefully is the best way to help the kosovo 
leadership vlasi told the crowd excesses will only play into 
the hands of our opponents 
mass rallies by hundreds of thousands of serbs in recent months 
have backed milosevics drive against vlasi jasari and other ethnic 
albanian leaders blamed by serbs for the alleged harassment of the 
slav minority in kosovo 
the ethnic albanian crowd at the pristina stadium waved yugoslav 
and communist party flags and was strongly proyugoslav reflecting 
the tacit support ethnic albanians have won from nonserbian 
communist leaders opposed to milosevic

the second crash of a b1b bomber in nine 
days probably will not force another grounding of the nations fleet 
of advanced jet bombers an air force general said friday 
the four crewmen parachuted to safety thursday night but the 
280 million plane was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at 
ellsworth air force base during a routine training flight 
the crash came two days after officials reported that the air 
force had inspected and cleared more than twothirds of the 98 b1b 
bombers which were grounded briefly following a crash nov 8 that 
destroyed a plane in texas 
the plane involved in thursdays crash underwent a threehour 
inspection monday and was cleared for flight air force officials 
said 
i see no reason to believe we will ground the fleet ive 
talked to my bosses and there is no intention at this time to 
ground them said brig gen robert marquette jr commander of 
the 12th air division at ellsworth 
the ellsworth crash and a b1b crash last week in texas do not 
appear to be linked to the same cause marquette said after a tour 
of the crash site we have evidence there was an engine fire in 
the texas crash he said 
it will take a team of military and civilian experts at least 30 
days to evaluate crash evidence he said 
the ejection system can propel crew members 100 to 150 feet into 
the air allowing them to parachute safely to the ground he said 
marquette said he did not know how fast or high the plane was flying 
when the crew bailed out 
marquette refused to speculate on the cause of thursdays crash 
but said there was no evidece of an engine fire at least one 
witness reported seeing an engine on fire before the crash 
an air force statement released at the pentagon in washington 
said there was no fire on board and pentagon sources said thursday 
the plane apparently clipped utility lines as it came in for its 
final landing 
the longrange strategic bomber was trying to land when it 
crashed at 1040 pm toppling a utility pole that cut off power to 
two schools and a housing area 
i could hear the plane coming in for a landing said john 
hanzel who lives next to the base i heard a muffled boom it 
just lit the field up probably for about 10 minutes 
the engine was on fire before it the plane hit the ground 
witness dale landreth told rapid city radio station kota 
another eyewitness ron fisher said we saw a big ball of fire 
that lit up the sky 
todd heinle a police officer in the nearby town of box elder 
said he was less than a mile away in a convenience store parking lot 
and noticed the plane because of a noise 
it almost sounded like the plane was trying to increase in 
power it was making a weird noise heinle said 
he and a fellow officer saw the wings tilt one way and then the 
other way then the lights in the plane went out it was just a 
split second after the lights went out there was an explosion and 
the flames started to come up 
heinle drove to an area close to the wreckage near the runway and 
saw the plane on the ground the plane was laying on the ground in 
flames he said it was pretty much destroyed 
one of the four crewmen was injured said sgt tony evans of the 
ellsworth public information office the crew members were 
identified as capt mick r guthals pilot los alamos nm capt 
grover m gossett offensive systems officer aiken sc major 
dean c spraggins defensive systems officer voorheesville ny 
and major thomas c skillman aircraft commander bellmeade nj 
spraggins the injured crewman was listed in good condition at 
lackland air force base in texas for treatment of a back injury 
the crash was the fourth in the four years since the united 
states began flying b1 aircraft the nations first new longrange 
bomber in more than 25 years 
last week a b1b crashed in a field near dyess air force base in 
west texas the crew of four ejected and survived 
the longrange bomber built by rockwell international is designed 
to fly at high speed and low altitude and deliver nuclear weapons 
marquette said he couldnt comment on whether the plane carried 
nuclear weaponsbut the air force statement thursday said the 
bomber carried no weapons there was no fire on board prior to the 
crash

solidarity leader lech walesa met friday 
night with interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak an activist 
source said but the results were not reported immediately 
government and roman catholic church officials were unusually 
secretive throughout the day about the meeting which appeared to be 
the latest effort to salvage stalled roundtable talks between the 
government and solidarity 
kiszczak asked walesa three weeks ago for a facetoface meeting 
to remove obstacles to the longpromised talks on the future of 
solidarity and on the broader issues of economic and political 
reform a week ago he sent another message to walesa but neither 
side has made public the contents 
the activist source a member of the outlawed solidarity 
confirmed a meeting had taken place and said the independent trade 
union would have a statement saturday morning the source spoke 
shortly before midnight and on condition his name not be used 
the discussions were offered by the government during polands 
worst wave of labor unrest in seven years 
after accepting the offer walesa agreed to bring an end to the 
last of the strikes 
walesa drove to warsaw from his home in gdansk on thursday night 
and conferred friday with advisers and church officials before 
meeting kiszczak 
walesas close adviser historian bronislaw geremek said friday 
that the only decisive issue blocking roundtable talks was 
whether the government would show a will to legalize solidarity 
he said that if the government makes a positive sign then it 
seems the chance for the roundtable will return 
walesa winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize has met three times 
with kiszczak about setting up the talks the last time on sept 16 
the official press quoted polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
as saying the fate of the proposed talks could be made clear in 
coming days 
the official communist party newspaper trybuna ludu said friday 
the authorities were not to blame for failure of the discussions to 
start as originally planned on oct 17 
it accused the opposition of insisting that the government 
concede beforehand on the major issue of relegalizing solidarity 
banned after jaruzelski imposed martial law in december 1981 
the talks were promised aug 31 in a meeting between walesa and 
kiszczak but preparations broke down when the government objected 
to the proposed participation of longtime solidarity advisers adam 
michnik and jacek kuron who officials branded as too extreme in 
their views 
walesa said he would tolerate no government interference in his 
delegation 
other issues that were blocking the roundtable appear to have 
been resolved

a runaway train reaching speeds exceeding 
80 mph raced through five towns and across more than 200 miles of 
west texas plains friday without headlights or other warning 
signals authorities said 
the train was derailed on a side track east of van horn about 
125 miles east of el paso and smashed into 27 parked boxcars but no 
injuries were reported 
it couldnt have happened at a better time union pacific 
spokesman alex tice said from the companys headquarters in omaha 
neb the line was clear and there wasnt much traffic out at that 
time of the night 
tice said the trains journey began about 130 am friday in big 
spring when someone started the engines on three union pacific 
locomotives pushing one to full throttle union pacific believes 
vandals are responsible 
the unmanned train with no cars attached ran through two 
switches in big spring onto the main line tice said it traveled 
214 miles before it was derailed he said 
in midland the train almost collided with a police car that was 
approaching the crossing said midland county sheriffs deputy 
richard gillette 
i just knew there had to be something wrong said gillette a 
former railroad employee it was moving so fast that it was 
passing through the crossings before the signals could be activated 
one of our units clocked it going 67 mph gillette said 
i tried to keep up with it for a couple of minutes it just ran 
off and left me 
gillette contacted his dispatcher who phoned union pacific 
officials in omaha 
tice said the railroad began contacting officials in counties 
along the route 
when i first heard about it i thought somebody was pulling a 
joke said gary ingram of the reeves county sheriffs department 
i told them i might saddle my horse and try to run it down but i 
didnt think it could run that fast 
they didnt find a whole lot of humor in that he said 
ingram said he watched the train pass about 1 miles south of his 
ranch in toyah 
from pecos the engines sped to toyah at more than 80 mph tice 
said 
the train finally was derailed when it was switched to a side 
track at wild horse siding about seven miles east of van horn tice 
said 
after smashing into the boxcars the lead engine came to a rest 
on its left side about 250 feet in front of the other two engines 
its left side scratched and dented and the engine compartment doors 
open spilling diesel fuel 
the second and third engines stood upright in a puddle of mud 
created by spilled fuel 
a union pacific supervisor at the scene said the engines would be 
lifted aboard a hospital train and taken to fort worth for 
repairs 
about 500 to 600 feet of track were damaged in the derailment 
tice said

seven soldiers were charged friday in 
the escape of a rebel who commanded the communist army that has 
fought to overthrow the government for 19 years 
a prominent stage director said he received a summons from the 
military to explain whether he was involved in the nov 12 escape of 
romulo kintanar 41 and kintanars wife gloria 38 
military prosecutors charged former stockade commander maj 
robelito comilang two other officers and four enlisted guards with 
negligence for letting the kintanars leave their cells to attend 
comilangs birthday party at his quarters next to the stockade at 
camp crame headquarters of the philippine constabulary 
when guards returned to take the couple back to their cells they 
had disappeared the military says 
an officer at the constabularys judge advocate generals office 
said the seven could face dismissal from service or imprisonment if 
convicted 
the military said kintanar was commander of the 25000member new 
peoples army when he and his wife were arrested in manila last 
march the military hailed the arrest as a major blow to the 19year 
insurgency 
the kintanars were awaiting trial on rebellion charges 
kintanar also was believed to have organized urban guerrilla 
squads responsible for killing hundreds of police and soldiers in 
philippine cities since 1985 
in a letter published friday by the manila standard and the 
philippine daily inquirer kintanar said he and his wife have 
succeeded in rejoining our comrades and our people in the 
countryside to actively contribute our humble share in our peoples 
continuing struggle for national freedom and social liberation 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
prominent stage director visited the stockade on nov 12 and allowed 
the couple to flee in his car 
behn cervantes told reporters that he was the director alluded to 
by the military he said he visited mrs kintanar and other 
prisoners at the stockade but left before the escape 
they are using me as a scapegoat cervantes said why blame 
me if their security measures are lax 
about 500 activists who joined a rally friday at a central manila 
square marched on the presidential palace later at the foot of the 
bridge leading to the palace they lit candles to symbolize the 
disappearance of about 100 activists this year 
rally leaders denounced corazon aquinos government for allegedly 
tolerating the same abuses practiced by ousted ruler ferdinand 
marcos mrs aquino has ordered security officials to investigate 
the disappearances 
the leftwing new patriotic alliance which says 15 of its 
members have disappeared this year released a statement urging mrs 
aquino and the congress to find the soldiers it believes caused the 
disappearances 
police blocked the protesters on the bridge near the palace but 
allowed them to hold a brief demonstration

concrete barriers that would have 
prevented a car carrying four young people from plunging into a 
river had been inexplicably moved officials said friday 
police also said 24 mostly empty beer cans were found inside the 
car none of the occupants all of whom died was of legal drinking 
age which is 21 
the car was discovered at the bottom of mill river on thursday 
five days after the four friends from east lyme disappeared during a 
night out in new haven 
the accident occurred on a dark stretch of road that was shut 
down last year because a 105yearold swingbridge was beyond 
repair the bridge was left open parallel to the river so boats 
could pass by on either side 
mayor biagio dilieto said an investigation confirmed the 2ton 
barriers had been moved leaving a gap wide enough for a car to pass 
through 
autopsies determined the four had drowned the state medical 
examiners office said results of bloodalcohol tests are expected 
next week but police said they did not know if they would be made 
public 
police said they had not yet determined who was driving the car 
which belonged to christy stevens 
separate funeral services beginning saturday were planned for 
miss stevens laura lagrotteria and jill sawyer all 19 and michael 
gallo 20 
sawyer attended the university of rhode island gallo was a 
student at southern connecticut state university in new haven and 
stevens was a student at mohegan community college in norwich 
lagrotteria worked at a pizza parlor in east lyme 
the blocks were out of place when the car went into the river 
but officials said the city did not learn until wednesday when a 
police officer visited the site that there was a gap large enough 
for a car to fit through 
the hole was closed that day 
police found the blocks out of position after an oct 22 car 
accident at the site but city officials said reports indicated the 
gap was not large enough at that time for a car to fit through the 
accident was the third at the barriers since the bridge was closed 
in august 1987 
city officials said they are investigating why public works crews 
put up wooden barriers after the accident but did not return the 
blocks to their original position

president reagans empowering a federal 
agency to prepare and impose evacuation plans for nuclear plants 
like seabrook flouts the intent of congress and faces certain legal 
challenge a seabrook foe said friday 
reagan on friday signed the order giving the federal emergency 
management agency broad new powers to submit evacuation plans for 
nuclear plants which have been unable to obtain licenses because of 
state or local opposition 
im sure the intervenors in the seabrook case will do 
something about it because congress did not change the laws and 
clearly they did not intend that the federal government should usurp 
state and local planning said jane doughty of the seacoast 
antipollution league 
the 2yearold 57 billion seabrook reactor has no operating 
license because massachusetts towns within its 10mile evacuation 
zone and massachusetts gov michael dukakis have refused to 
cooperate in emergency planning 
reagans order lets fema develop an evacuation plan and submit it 
to the nuclear regulatory commission on behalf of the local 
community until recently states were required to submit an 
evacuation plan in the nrc licensing process due to opposition to 
seabrook by massachusetts and to the shoreham plant on long island 
by new york gov mario cuomo the nrc has accepted but not approved 
plans for both plants written by their utility owners 
both plans face legal challenges 
rep robert smith rnh said the final version seems slightly 
weaker than the wording in the original draft much more 
conciliatory 
he said he supports the thrust of the order because he feels the 
federal government must step in when state or local governments try 
to block a plants licensing 
govelect judd gregg former 2nd district congressman and sen 
gordon humphrey rnh condemned the order when it was reported 
earlier this year but they did not return calls from the associated 
press seeking comment 
paul mceachern a seabrook foe who lost his bid as the 1988 
democratic gubernatorial nominee said the order was a foregone 
conclusion that the reagan administration put the order on a back 
burner until after the election 
the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming that was the case 
that they would get it signed at the first appropriate time after 
the election mceachern said 
the nuclear regulatory commission has demonstrated it will 
change any rule that gets in the way of licensing seabrook and 
with the election results there is absolutely nothing that will 
prevent this administratively from going on line there may be legal 
challenges but thats all that remains mceachern said 
seabrook spokesman rob williams said the order really does 
nothing to hasten seabrooks licensing he said the plants owners 
already received nrc permission to develop their owns plans for 
uncooperative massachusetts communities and new hampshire has 
cooperated all along 
those plans were tested earlier this year and received high marks 
from fema he said 
i dont see this speeding licensing williams said it is 
welcome news really on the national level because any plant that 
faces that situation of nonparticipation like we faced now has 
clear federal policy on how federal resources would be used in 
planning

aixenprovence france ap cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk said the last round of talks toward a settlement in 
his country had failed a french news agency reported friday 
sihanouk blamed hun sen head of the vietnaminstalled government 
in phnom penh for creating an impasse in the talks agencefrance 
presse reported 
sihanouk who ruled cambodia from 19411970 is head of a 
resistance coalition fighting the government in cambodia 
afp said he made his remarks late thursday to a group of students 
in this southern french town 
sihanouk met hun sen and son sann representing the khmer 
peoples national liberation front at a hotel outside paris nov 6 
the talks were part of efforts by the resistance movements and the 
cambodian government to reach an agreement on the future of cambodia 
sihanouk accused hun sen of putting vietnamese and soviet 
interests ahead of cambodian concerns afp reported the soviet 
union backs vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 and maintains 
120000 troops there 
china backs the khmer rouge held responsible for a reign of 
terror in which a quarter of cambodias 8 million people died before 
vietnam invaded and ousted the government hun sens government 
picked by vietnam has not been recognized by noncommunist nations 
the khmer rouge is not taking part in the talks sihanouk has 
said no settlement is possible without the khmer rouge who were 
invited to the last meeting but who were eventually excluded 
because the proposed envoy was rejected as too low ranking for a 
summit 
the discussions yielded no concrete results simply because hun 
sen was defending the interests of vietnam sihanouk was quoted as 
saying adding according to afp that resistance groups and the 
government were speaking two different languages 
sihanouk said soviet president mikhail gorbachev and authorities 
in beijing now were key to settling the dispute the agency 
reported china wants concessions in exchange for withdrawing its 
support of the 40000 khmer rouge guerrillas the largest resistance 
force moscow wants assurance that upon vietnams withdrawing its 
troops in 1990 as expected the khmer rouge will not take power 
i am counting on the two superpowers to convince vietnam to 
reach a peaceful political solution to the problem of cambodia 
sihanouk was quoted as saying 
vietnam is not participating directly in the peace talks afp 
said sihanouk called on vietnam to participate in an international 
conference in paris 
the meeting made no substantial progress toward settlement but 
established a working commission based in paris the commissions 
brief is to study all the possibilities for a political solution 
to the cambodian problem

met friday with president jose sarney and top military and civilian 
cabinet ministers 
carlucci told a news conference at the us embassy that he 
discussed brazilian arms sales to the mideast and libya 
brazil has assured us it will follow a responsible policy and 
we accept that carlucci said 
he said america was willing to step up the supply of technology 
to brazilian arms manufacturers but declined to elaborate 
brazil is a major arms supplier to the third world middle east 
and african nations are important clients 
carlucci described brazilus military relations as 
excellent however brazilian navy minister adm henrique saboia 
called relations cool and said carluccis visit was aimed at 
warming them up a little 
carlucci said the us government was not concerned that sarney 
recently visited the soviet union and that brazil and the soviets 
agreed to exchange military attaches 
the united states doesnt discourage relations of any country 
with moscow on the contrary the more the soviets open to the west 
the more evident it is that their regime is a failure he said

a broken jet fuel pipeline at the san 
francisco international airport disrupted dozens of incoming and 
departing flights and temporarily stranded scores of passengers 
friday afternoon 
incoming flights were diverted to airports throughout the west 
coast and numerous departing flights were delayed several hours 
said airport spokesman ron wilson exact figures were not available 
contractors broke a 12inch underground fuel line near the twa 
terminal about 430 pm effectively shutting off supplies to all 
three terminals wilson said 
pilots are being advised that there is no fuel available 
said jennifer donohue of the airports public affairs department 
fuel service was restored about two hours later to most of the 
airport said donohue although delays were expected to continue 
into the evening at least four airlines faced flight delays late 
into the evening because of cleanup operations and continued 
difficulty in fuel delivery 
about 50000 gallons of fuel spilled and were contained a short 
time later when the pipeline was shut off to stop it from spreading 
into san francisco bay said donohue 
airport officials estimated there are 60 to 70 flights each hour 
in and out of the airport on fridays

the anglican and roman catholic archbishops in 
england have urged the government to order new legal hearings of the 
life terms imposed on four irish people after ira bombings that 
killed seven people in britain 
i have a deep sense of unease about the convictions in these 
cases which do not appear to me to be safe and satisfactory said 
anglican archbishop of canterbury robert runcie in a letter to home 
secretary douglas hurd 
runcies office said he wrote it after being impressed by 
what cardinal basil hume catholic archbishop of westminster told 
him about the cases 
hume said thursday he asked for the cases to be reopened at a 
meeting with hurd hume was accompanied by four former top officials 
of the judicial system who expressed doubt about the convictions 
the archbishops said evidence pointing to the innocence of the 
four was never put to the jury that convictions were based solely 
on confessions that could have been induced by beatings and drugs 
and that two ira men convicted in another case joe oconnell and 
brendon dowd claimed they carried out the bombings and had never 
heard of the other four 
hurds office said he was considering the pleas and was unlikely 
to decide before christmas 
the bombings at three pubs frequented by soldiers killed seven 
people and injured 134 in 1974 two pubs were in guildford 30 miles 
southwest of london and one in woolwich east london 
carole richardson 29 patrick armstrong 36 paul hill 34 and 
gerry conlon 33 who still protest their innocence were jailed for 
life in 1975 for the guildford bombings and hill and armstrong also 
for the woolwich blast 
the outlawed irish republican army has said it has bombed targets 
in mainland britain as well as northern ireland where it is 
fighting to end british rule

a study that found seventhday adventists can 
expect to live longer suggests that others who adopt the healthful 
lifestyle of the religious group may also extend their life spans 
practicing seventhday adventists abstain from smoking and 
drinking alcoholic beverages and many adopt a vegetarian or 
nearvegetarian diet this approach had a significant association 
with life expectancy said jan w kuzma a professor of vital 
statistics at loma linda university in california 
his study calculated life tables for a group of 27514 
seventhday adventists 9804 males and 17710 females older than 
age 30 who enrolled in a study in 1960 kuzma followed up on that 
study through 1985 by checking california death records and compared 
the life expectancies to the general california population 
kuzma found that a 35yearold male seventhday adventist was 
likely to live to be 82 nine more years than the average california 
white male for females the advantage was 76 years longer

one of the enduring myths of the singlefamily 
housing market is that prices periodically collapse wiping out the 
only real asset that many families possess 
books have been written about it one author in fact has hired 
out as a consultant advertising himself as the guru who foresaw the 
great real estate collapse of the early 1980s which never occurred 
there have been local and even regional declines there have been 
sharp shortterm declines that are corrected within a few years 
there have been weak markets and conceivably there could be a 
collapse in the future 
there exists also the situation in which the value of a house 
might have spurted from 50000 to 100000 in two years and then 
retreated to 90000 or even 85000 despite the sizable gain this 
sometimes is called a collapse 
but examining the record over the past few decades nothing 
qualifies as a national singlefamily housing market collapse 
fueling the collapse speculation has been the spectacular rises 
in certain regions particularly the northeast and new england 
which more than coincidentally are the home grounds of a good many 
financial analysts 
but as housing and real estate people are becoming hoarse from 
shouting intelligent financial analysts should not project regional 
or local factors especially when these factors are extreme into a 
national phenomenon 
ken colton executive vice president of the national assocation 
of home builders observes that especially high land and development 
prices in california and the northeast account in part for the 
prices in those areas 
moreover while regions of the united states fell into a serious 
recession during the mid1980s much of california and the 
northeast especially new england enjoyed boom times there were 
reasons therefore for high prices 
a common argument from the financial community makes the 
assumption that housing should be considered only as an investment 
and then to measure price in relation to yield 
on such a basis they say the rents obtainable from a house do 
not justify the price that is should a homeowner choose to rent 
the property it would be impossible to obtain sufficient rent to 
justify it as an investment 
housing people agree but wonder why housing should be viewed 
simply as an investment when it so obviously is more than that 
housing is a usable and essential commodity compared to a stock 
or bond which really has no useful puurpose other than to add to 
ones investment portfolio says colton 
a home he observes provides essential shelter and security 
its value as an investment although important is nonetheless a 
secondary benefit for most americans 
moreover unlike paper investments houses are not bought and 
sold in seconds people do not dump their houses on the market en 
masse and sit on the curb all night the market is relatively 
protected from mass hysteria 
could there be a national housing price collapse unlikely 
especially in isolation from the general condition of the economy as 
a whole 
one concern of housing economists is the inability of young 
couples to enter the market homebuying by firsttimers continues to 
slip and the reason why is obvious prices are high in relation to 
incomes 
a healthy housing market requires access for firsttimers they 
are the base the first rung of the mobility ladder without them 
the rung of owners just above cannot move up to more expensive 
housing 
such a situation could mean every tier of the market could slip 
to a lower rung but that would hardly constitute a crash 
true it might mean a sudden adjustment but it would be 
selfcorrecting too since firsttimers finally could get their 
foot on the first rung

it happened in a violent flash as 
james and a friend were walking up steep dark stairs toward a gay 
bar after a midnight walk along the beach 
two young men with closecropped hair suddenly attacked them from 
behind yelling youre going to die faggot they bludgeoned 
james with a blunt object that struck his head with the force of a 
lead pipe 
several of his teeth were knocked out his left eye was so badly 
damaged that doctors had to remove it his friend suffered minor 
injuries 
emotionally i think it would be a lot easier to accept if they 
were just trying to rob me said james 45 sitting in his irvine 
apartment recently a black eye patch covering his left eye he 
spoke on condition his last name not be used 
this is different this is against me as a person its 
something i live with every minute every second 
the attack was the third of the summer on gays in laguna beach a 
coastal resort 50 miles southwest of los angeles but gay activists 
police and crime victim counselors say laguna beach is not alone 
from san francisco to new york reports of crimes targeted at 
homosexuals have increased dramatically in the last four years up 
300 percent by one estimate in what gay leaders see as a violent 
reaction to the aids crisis 
commonly called gay bashing the reports range from 
latenight beatings and slurs yelled in streets to more subtle acts 
such as one communitys effort to remove homosexuals from protection 
under a human rights ordinance gay activists say 
im not sure that people hate us any more than they ever did 
but its certainly easier now to express that hate said john 
fall a spokesman for the activist group act upla 
an audit by the national gay and lesbian task force in washington 
shows reports of gay crimes and harassment have more than tripled in 
three years from 2042 cases in 1985 to 7008 cases last year 
centers that counsel gaybashing victims in los angeles san 
francisco and new york also report record numbers of cases police 
in new york report fewer attacks than gay activists but also show 
the attacks about tripling in recent years 
one area well acquainted with gay bashing is west hollywood 
where gay bars clubs and restaurants line santa monica boulevard 
on friday and saturday nights gay men walk the sidewalks from bar 
to bar as young men from the suburbs cruise the boulevard calling 
them names 
the verbal barbs often lead to violence 
a july 2 attack was typical police said at about 2 am two 
beverly hills men were beaten one of them cut by a broken beer 
bottle by two men cruising in a pickup police said the attackers 
yelled fag as they beat the men 
police and gay activists said it is even more dangerous in nearby 
silver lake where gays who frequent bars and businesses share the 
streets with youth gangs 
the bars themselves are often targets of vandals who smash 
windows and spray paint antigay epithets on walls and parked cars 
youve got gang members there who are very macho and this is 
how they express it said capt mark squiers of the los angeles 
county sheriffs department 
sometimes the targets of gay bashing try to fight back 
duke crestfield of san francisco where gay bashing reports are 
at record levels had had enough of the taunts shouted from a tour 
bus and so he boarded it in the confrontation that followed a 
halfdozen riders punched him and smashed his glasses before dumping 
him off the bus he said 
often the victims of gaybashing cases like other hate crimes 
have emotional scars counselors say 
many feel anger many go through depression anxiety serious 
sleep disorders eating disorders inability to focus on the job 
said david wertheimer executive director of the gay and lesbian 
antiviolence project in new york city they also face questions 
about their own identity questions about their sexual orientation 
and the goodness of that 
in james case the june 19 attack left him worried about the 
future his reduced eyesight makes him afraid to drive at night and 
gave him headaches he worries about how he can continue to take 
care of his schoolage child he raises alone 
gay bashers find both a motivation and a vindication in aids 
according to activists 
aids is perceived to be a gay disease and as it moves out of 
the gay community into other communities it has generated a lot of 
feelings of anger and hostility said laguna beach mayorpro tem 
robert gentry who is gay 
those feelings found expression activists said in an effort by 
a group in irvine working to remove homosexuals from protection by 
the citys human rights ordinance and in two aids testing 
initiatives on californias november ballot 
voters rejected a proposal to force doctors to report aids 
patients so that partners could be traced but they approved an 
initiative authorizing courts to compel testing of people accused of 
certain crimes which backers said would help protect rape victims 
and law officers fearful they might have been exposed 
people are trying to put us back in our place said lester 
olmsteadrose spokesman for san franciscos community united 
against violence its an attempt in a crude way to make us go 
back to what we used to be which was closeted and quiet and never 
talking about ourselves that of course is something which we 
cannot do and will not do 
a 1987 california law adds felony charges in cases where a 
persons civil rights are abused because of their sexual preference 
ancestry religion or race 
in west hollywood the recent rise in heckling quickly prompted a 
meeting between city and sheriffs department officials in arrest 
reports sheriffs deputies now include antigay aspects of a crime 
so that prosecutors can seek harsher penalties deputies also work 
with a local gay organization that operates a hotline 
the city is sending a clear message that were not going to 
tolerate this said city spokeswoman helen goss were going to 
prosecute you if you do this 
local antidiscrimination efforts are fine in the view of laguna 
beachs gentry but he said larger issues must be resolved through 
aids eduction 
the aids epidemic nationally fuels the fires of hatred he 
said ive never been so scared in my life

when joe doherty broke out of a maximum 
security prison in northern ireland seven years ago the irish 
republican armys underground network of safehouses and sympathizers 
led him to this working class irishamerican suburb of new york 
doherty had been convicted with three others of killing a british 
army officer in a 1980 shootout 
in kearny he lived with an american girlfriend worked in 
construction and took a parttime job at clancys bar in manhattan 
it was sort of like being normal for once having a job and 
knowing youre not going to get assassinated or stopped in the 
streets because of your religion doherty said in a recent 
interview at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan 
on june 28 1983 a group of fbi agents walked into clancys 
ordered a round of beers and took him into custody again 
since then the case has grown to involve the the white house 
the justice department civil rights activists and the leaders of 
great britain and ireland 
doherty doesnt deny being involved in the killing but says it 
was a political act and that he warrants political asylum in the 
united states 
the government disagrees the justice department calls doherty a 
terrorist and says he should be deported to britain 
the question of who gets political asylum and who is a refugee 
should be based on the law on facts and on circumstances said 
mary pike dohertys lawyer but the question really depends on 
which government youre fleeing if its a government with which the 
reagan administration wants to remain friendly then you cant get 
asylum 
if i was a cuban said doherty theres no way i would be 
deported 
doherty a bachelor has spent the better part of his 33 years in 
hiding or in prison he joined the ira in 1969 after the british 
army crushed a catholic civil rights march on what has become known 
as bloody sunday 
id watched my father live his life as a secondclass citizen 
and tell me to learn a trade and then emigrate said doherty i 
didnt want to tell my son at 17 that he had to go to canada to find 
a job because of his religion 
while lawyers debate his case doherty has spent the past five 
years in a 12footby6foot cell at the federal prison in new york 
i see this case as a complete rejection of the constitution by 
the government said paul odwyer a civil rights attorney in new 
york there is no other prisoner i know of who has been held for 
such a protracted period of time having committed no crime in the 
united states 
tom moseley a former justice department attorney who handled the 
doherty case said the bottom line is that doherty is a terrorist 
who killed someone 
we felt he should have been extradited to the uk on the 
grounds of murder and assault said moseley now in private 
practice in morristown 
some who sympathize with the iras goal of uniting the republic 
of ireland with the northern six counties that make up the british 
province of northern ireland consider doherty a folk hero 
the justice department went to court last year to stop 
philadelphians from naming doherty honorary grand marshal of their 
st patricks day parade 
free joe doherty graffiti adorns walls and sidewalks all over 
new york city at a new jersey bar not far from where doherty lived 
his picture hangs alongside that of bobby sands the ira prisoner 
who starved to death during a 1981 hunger strike at a british prison 
among dohertys supporters are new yorks roman catholic 
archbishop cardinal john oconnor amnesty international the 
american civil liberties union and the rev jesse jackson who 
visited doherty in prison in july 
but there also are influential forces fighting for dohertys 
extradition 
british prime minister margaret thatcher raised the case in talks 
with president reagan during a 1986 visit to washington 
sen richard lugar rind described the jailed ira man as an 
irish ghengis khan lugar led a successful fight to exclude the 
political exception clause from the centuryold usbritish 
extradition treaty when it was renegotiated in 1986 
the british government filed a formal request for dohertys 
extradition in 1983 it was denied in december 1984 by us district 
judge john e sprizzo in brooklyn who ruled that dohertys crime 
was a political act and qualified the defendant for political asylum 
the government appealed and us district judge charles s haight 
decided in dohertys favor a government appeal to the us court of 
appeals in new york upheld dohertys previous victories 
having failed to extradite doherty the justice department began 
deportation proceedings 
since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent 
doherty chose the independent republic of ireland and his decision 
was upheld by immigration judge howard i cohen in 1986 
if i was sent back to ireland i would be arrested and put in 
jail doherty said but hopefully it would be a humane place and 
i would get a fair hearing not like in the north 
the administration this time through the immigration and 
naturalization service appealed cohens order and again lost two 
more appeals and two more government defeats followed the latest 
coming nov 14 
meanwhile the republic of ireland under pressure from london 
and washington in december 1987 ratified the european convention on 
terrorism which calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed 
terrorists that eliminated dohertys irish option 
today doherty is pinning his hopes on winning asylum though 
after 5 years of court battles he isnt too optimistic about his 
chances for freedom 
i go to court i win he says but here i am

this is the final installment of an occasional 
series that has told the story of the drought of 88 through the 
eyes of one farm family the chases of barry county michigan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gordon and jean chase prayed for rain all 
summer long now they pray for just a few days of sunshine 
in june when hot dry winds blew the dusty dirt off seeds that 
wouldnt germinate when the worst dry spell since the dust bowl of 
the 1930s left crops withered and stunted the chases never 
expected their fields would be too muddy at harvest time 
weve never seen a year like this gordon chase says shaking 
his head weve gone from the worst drought in 50 years to one of 
the wettest and coldest octobers ever one extreme to the other 
from april 1 through midjuly the chases 1100acre cashcrop 
and dairy farm in southwest michigans barry county received barely 
an inch of rain since aug 1 about 18 inches of rain and an inch 
of snow have pounded the weak stalks of corn and wilted soybeans 
more than twice the normal amount of precipitation 
the chases arent alone many of the same midwest farmers who 
struggled through the summers devastating drought were taunted by 
rains that came too late to do any good 
the recent downpours which have forced many farmers to delay 
harvesting their shriveled crops bring the year to a sad ironic 
close 
this will be the first time in the chases 18 years of farming 
that they will have no crop to sell everything they harvest will be 
needed to feed their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle with only 
about half a silo full of highmoisture corn enough to last about 
three months the chases will have to buy from other farmers 
a year like this makes you realize more than ever that the 
weather is the farmers biggest friend or worst enemy chase says 
sinking into a recliner in the couples living room 
he and his wife both 51 estimate they lost about half their 
corn and soybean crop and all of the string beans they were growing 
for a canning company their wheat crop was harvested before the 
drought hit in may 
but the chases dont complain 
at the height of the drought you wondered whether youd have 
anything at all chase says with a shrug 
the loss of their cash crop represents a 30percent cut in the 
chases income to compound their financial plight their expenses 
have been 20 percent higher than normal mostly because of the money 
they spent on irrigation 
but because irrigation only helps when theres some rainfall 
we got zero out of that chase says in disgust recalling the 
summer nights he and his son kurt spent in the fields babysitting 
the irrigation system so that no water was wasted 
the chases are thankful their dairy herd which represents about 
60 percent of the farms income is healthy and productive the 
income they make on their cash crop usually covers their operating 
expenses and pays for the 700 acres of land they rent about 
75000 this year 
its really frightening jean chase says we dont know 
where well get it but itll work out we dont dwell on it 
because it reminds us how horrible that loss really is 
the chases also are thankful they have an understanding lender 
theyre waiting to find out if they qualify for the federal 
governments 39 billion droughtrelief aid program 
but they cant help but think back to their early spring 
projections 
on paper this looked like it was going to be the familys most 
prosperous year ever after managing to save their farm from 
foreclosure three years ago by deeding to the federal land bank and 
leasing it back parcel by parcel the chases expected this year 
would be the one to pay off a sizable chunk of the debt they had 
accumulated 
now all theyd like to do is finish harvesting by thanksgiving 
a goal theyve met every year it seems unlikely this time 
the chases who are in a partnership with son kurt and 
daughterinlaw dena pray for clear skies in order to harvest the 
remaining acres of corn and soybeans 
every time it rains or snows several dry days must follow 
before its safe to take equipment out in the fields theyve 
already had equipment stuck in the mud twice 
now all we can do is pray for a freeze gordon chase says 
but if it snows first thatll just insulate it and itll stay 
wet 
and if the fields arent harvested in the fall it means more 
work in the spring because the fields would have to be cleared 
before planting 
meanwhile the corn still standing in the brown muddy fields is 
growing moldy rendering it useless as feed for the cattle and with 
each pounding rain more of the weak crop is ruined 
still the chases look ahead with hope 
i guess the thought of giving up doesnt enter my mind chase 
says even though it has been a very trying year and very 
frustrating we have a lot to be thankful for and we survive because 
we know next year will be better

in his penthouse office just off times square 
geraldo rivera shows off a catchers mask given by a friend after 
the televised brawl that broke his nose and sent his talk show 
ratings soaring 
within hours wasting no time in taking advantage of the 
publicity surrounding his rearranged honker hes taping a new 
episode of geraldo called has tv gone too far he reruns 
footage of the brawl and confronts a panel of tv critics backed by 
an audience that occasionally boos the critics 
rivera is a creature of irony 
in 1986 when he opened al capones secret vault on live 
television the vault was embarrassingly empty but the show was 
the highestrated syndicated special ever 
earlier this month his nbc special on devil worship was thrashed 
by critics for tastelessness when the ratings came in it was the 
fourth highestrated network show of the week 
hes the butt of jokes and the object of satire when he canceled 
an appearance on nbcs saturday night live because of his broken 
nose dana carvey as the church lady noted in the sketch 
geraldo rivera couldnt be with us so we have the next best thing 
a monkey 
rivera sighs it seems he just cant have success and esteem too 
i always harbored a semisecret desire to someday achieve peer 
acceptance he says certainly during my years at abc i tried 
to be as quiet as possible i didnt do very much press at all i 
did as many kinds of pentagontype stories wastefraudabuse 
stories i called them wfas as i could possibly do i devoted 
all my attention to that nonflashy kind of stuff and i still 
didnt get that kind of acceptance 
by the time i left abc in december 85 i knew id be a rebel 
forever the oddball now i dont think about it very much 
rivera came on the scene in the 1970s jumping into stories with 
both feet weeping over abused mental patients getting chased by 
security guards trying to expose the plight of migrant laborers 
when he left abc news he said it was because the divisions 
president roone arledge had killed his 2020 story about 
robert kennedy and marilyn monroe 
since then rivera has had a series of controversial but 
successful syndicated specials and his yearold talk show defied 
the odds by muscling into the crowded field headed by the oprah 
winfrey show and donahue 
his flamboyance has earned him a place in the socalled tabloid 
tv genre that includes the morton downey jr show and foxs 
lurid quasinewsmagazines a current affair and the reporters 
i havent changed just the labels change says rivera 
newspunks was the last three months now its trash tv i 
remember the days when i was the advocacy reporter the 
confrontation reporter and the ambush reporter i remember that 
one was around for about a year my main point is that im still 
doing exactly the same thing ive always been doing 
when rivera expanded from syndication into network television 
the critics pounced harder than ever 
im convinced that very often what i do if you put a different 
reporter in and they said the same words and you had exactly the 
same images and the program was exactly the same the reviews would 
be far more benign i think that so many times i get reviewed and 
not what i do riversa says 
i just think ive found what suits me i feel a real sense of 
populism im not ashamed of it i feel the audience often thinks of 
me as their surrogate or as a friend 
so why if he has such a following doesnt he tackle weightier 
subjects than skinheads and transexuals 
we did a twoparter on the homeless six weeks ago he said 
we do a lot of stories on subjects that are not the flash or sex 
topics i dont do the ozone depletion i dont do the little whales 
trapped off point barrow theres a lot of people who could do those 
stories theres a lot of people who could do the budget deficit 
better than i could 
i think that as we become more successful and as the program 
evolves youre going to see a richer mix we already moved the 
talkshow genre into a harder news area we do a lot more in terms 
of crime and punishment or drug abuse or those kinds of street 
problems than talk shows have ever done certainly than daytime 
talk shows have ever done 
critics aside rivera would seem to have no reason to change he 
says his talk show will gross about 25 million this year and has 
gone from 70 stations when it premiered a year ago to 178 currently 
laughing all the way to the bank he says isnt that the 
truth

in a business that had grown accustomed to 
explosive growth 1988 has turned out to be a year of retrenchment 
for the mutual fund industry 
but the worst fears of fund managers and their millions of 
shareholders after the stock market crash in 1987 have so far not 
been borne out 
indeed the fund industry is in remarkably good shape under 
the circumstances says sheldon jacobs in his investment advisory 
letter noload fund investor 
from the stock market peak at the end of august 1987 through the 
end of the third quarter this year total assets in the nations 
mutual funds declined 54 percent jacobs notes 
still as jacobs points out the recent total of 80236 billion 
remains much larger than it was at any time before 1987 
along with total assets the fund industry measures its health by 
the pace of sales of new shares as compared to redemptions that 
occur when investors cash out their holdings 
sales reported for 1988 to date have shown a drastic 57 percent 
drop but redemptions are down too as a result the industry eked 
out net sales of 15 billion for 1988 so far against 79 billion 
at the same point last year 
what about performance the subject closest to the hearts of fund 
investors most managers may not be able to claim great triumphs 
but they do not have to hide their heads in shame either 
according to the wiesenberger investment companies service the 
nearly 1000 funds it monitors posted an average loss of 73 percent 
over the 12 months through sept 30 a period that of course 
includes the debacle in october 1987 
over the same span the leading stock market averages and indexes 
recorded declines of 148 percent to 186 percent just about 
threequarters of the funds did better than a 148 percent loss 
an examination of the numbers prompts several conclusions some 
upbeat others potentially worrisome 
by diversifying into such areas as moneymarket investing over 
the past 15 years or so the industry appears to have cushioned 
itself from the boombust cycles it experienced in the 1960s and 
early 1970s 
while storms in the stock market used to send floods of money out 
of mutual funds altogether a lot of that money is now evidently 
transferred to money market funds 
stock funds however are not the only group that has run into 
some disenchantment volatile spells of rising interest rates which 
translate into declining bond prices have helped cool the boom in 
bond mutual funds 
some analysts say that could spell trouble sooner or later for 
issuers of debt securities especially those of the highyield or 
junk variety 
so far this year net cash flow into bond funds has been roughly 
5 billion compared to 43 billion last year and a peak of 120 
billion in 1986 said suresh bhirud chief investment strategist 
at the investment firm of oppenheimer amp co 
meanwhile bhirud observes corporate takeovers and buybacks have 
created a large number of junk bond offerings seeking buyers 
given that investment flows are beginning to slow there is an 
increased likelihood that one of these offerings will suffer a 
serious blow due to a lack of buyers he says 
a great deal of money to finance buyouts may come from banks 
investing institutions and wealthy individuals nevertheless argues 
bhirud it is questionable whether professional investors can 
assimilate all the potential offerings of lowquality highyield 
bonds

in the garish apartments of what 
once was the eroscenter cabaret and bordello indigent immigrants 
from eastern europe shuffle along the hallways in kerchiefs and worn 
leather caps 
on grosse freiheit the renowned row of rowdy nightclubs that 
launched rock luminaries like the beatles and jimi hendrix 
burnedout lightbulbs and faulty neon signs serve now only to 
advertise the creeping neglect that afflicts one of the worlds most 
famous redlight districts 
along this glitzy strand once called the most sinful mile in 
the world the clubs and pubs and peepshows hanging on to life 
with a dwindling clientele are furnished with tattered banquettes 
and wobbly tables and darkened by windows smudged with ages of 
tobacco smoke 
beset by aids fears unemployment and a booming xrated video 
cassette market hamburgs famed sankt pauli district has fallen on 
the hardest times of its colorful 150year history 
in the early 19th century the nomans land between the rival 
ports of hamburg and altona welcomed the boisterous brood of sailors 
and riggers scorned by fashionable city centers 
but the image of outrage worn for years with pride has decayed 
leaving sankt pauli in much the same state of decline as other 
entertainment quarters past their prime 
today the traces of a long life of excess appear like wrinkles on 
a face that has not aged gracefully 
blinking colored lights from the surviving sex shops and discos 
illuminate the litter and grime as clearly as the prostitutes 
bundled in pastelcolored skisuits against the brisk november winds 
off the elbe 
estimated to number about 2000 or half the number a generation 
ago the women take languid draws off cigarettes or sip coffee from 
foam cups while surveying a motorized stream of carousers and 
curious 
in the last years because of unemployment and aids and a 
general reduction in the money available for this kind of 
entertainment sankt pauli has seen a progressive decline and is 
unlikely to recover from it said hans dittrich chief of the 
davidwache police station that stands guard at spielbudenplatz 
funhouse square 
in some ways sankt paulis loss has been hamburgs gain as the 
departure of many prostitutes and purveyors of pornography has made 
way for more legitimate businesses and resulted in a decrease in 
assaults killings and other serious crimes dittrich said 
we still have 10 or 12 pursesnatchings or unarmed assaults 
each month but the trend has been one of decline the police 
official said in an interview i would characterize sankt pauli 
now as one of the safer areas of the city tourists have no need to 
fear leaving their cars here and walking around for a look at what 
used to be unique 
the regions reputation now draws more gawkers than stalkers a 
trend that frustrates the economy of sankt pauli while maintaining 
its bustling appearance by night 
sankt pauli veterans complain that the area with its famed 
reeperbahn strip survives today merely as a tourist attraction 
why would a guy want to sit in a cabaret and have to pay 
hundreds of marks to drink champagne when he can rent the same thing 
on a video cassette and watch it at home asks edwin ross who for 
33 years has painted nude murals and signboards for sankt paulis 
sex theaters the only people here now are firsttime visitors who 
remember a reeperbahn that no longer exists 
its unfortunate we cannot stay open at night when the women 
who come here out of curiosity are looking into our windows said 
evamaria roepke operator of a designer lingerie and cosmetics 
store on the reeperbahn 
west german law dictates that sales outlets must close by 630 
pm on weekdays and stay open for only a few hours on saturday 
mornings 
ms roepkes shop has been hardhit by the closure of 
eroscenter one of the regions two largest houses of prostitution 
there used to be 600 girls around the corner but now there are 
only immigrants who have no money to spend on goods like these 
she lamented gesturing toward the skimpy and shimmering 
nightclothes adorning the walls 
eroscenter owner wilhelm bartels told the magazine der spiegel 
when he shuttered the sprawling sex shop last year that aids has 
finished off sankt pauli 
while the health threat has cut deeply into the volume of sex 
trade in the region the economy has followed with a devastating 
finishing blow 
west germany suffers from an 8 percent unemployment rate and the 
nature of the merchant marine has shifted over the past two decades 
to a fleet comprised more often of married family men than the 
single sailors and stevedores of the past 
a nationwide liberalization 20 years ago made prostitution legal 
between 8 pm and 6 am injecting a degree of regularity and even 
legitimacy into the ancient profession 
precinct chief dittrich says prostitutes have formed selfhelp 
groups that work with state officials to offer social security 
benefits to those willing to pay taxes on their income and to 
educate young women about health risks like the aids virus 
the aura of acceptability has taken some of the mysticism out of 
what the germans used to call tingeltangel a european 
forerunner of honkytonk 
with the departure of most of the major sex theaters here have 
come a number of alternatives appealing to a broader public like 
the caribbean beat of sam brasils live music club and hamburgs 
leading discotheque at kaiserkeller where the beatles introduced 
their immortal sounds in the early 1960s before crossing the street 
to play at the star club where they rocketed to international fame 
the broadway musical cats has drawn crowds at the 
operettenhaus since 1985 and a sprawling carnival covers the 
grounds of heiligengeistfeld spirits field three times each year 
including during the busy novemberdecember christmas season 
some sankt pauli merchants however are skeptical of the 
regions chances for saving itself 
our best days are over says ross the 63yearold erotic 
painter known to his neighbors as the rubens of the reeperbahn 
ross work reflects the evolution of the district and some 
merchants efforts to ride with a changing tide ross says most of 
his business now is in painting signs for doughnut shops and discos 
or making portraits from photographs to be hung in private homes 
theres no more business with cabarets says the artist who 
came here in 1955 from east germany where he earned his living 
painting model workers and communist giants like marx engels and 
lenin 
the daytime scene attests to a grim economic future with streets 
empty of all but derelicts and discarded fastfood wrappers wafting 
in the curls of breeze brushing the curbstones 
you cant make this into a moulin rouge with fancy shows for 
which you have to pay 20 or 30 dancers says ross for sankt 
pauli those days are unfortunately in the past

energy futures analysts remain skeptical that 
current opec talks will result in an accord to lower production and 
bolster world crude prices 
oil futures prices sagged thursday pressured by fear that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries might flood the 
markets with more oil and bring about a price collapse 
on the new york mercantile exchange the december contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
tumbled 38 cents to settle at 1329 per barrel the contract had 
fallen 23 cents on wednesday other contract months also declined 
sharply thursday with next octobers contract down 87 cents at 
1270 
futures prices of refined products were lower across the board 
the december contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 4565 cents a 
gallon down 085 cent from wednesdays close 
the december contract for wholesale home heating oil which rose 
007 cent on wednesday fell 150 cents to close at 4297 cents a 
gallon 
analysts said the market opened weakly reflecting negative 
investor reaction to threats by saudi arabia and other opec members 
that they would start dumping more oil on world markets if a quota 
agreement among members was not reached 
saudi arabia produces just over half of its capacity of 
approximately 10 million barrels a day because of falling crude 
prices its oil revenue has plunged 
the threats came as two opec committees began meeting thursday in 
vienna to hammer out an accord that would limit production and 
bolster oil prices those talks will culminate with a meeting of all 
13 opec ministers starting monday 
analysts said prices weakened further shortly after the meeting 
convened about 1 pm est in response to a statement by iraqi oil 
minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi who told reporters before 
the closeddoor meeting began its very clear our position hasnt 
changed 
the iraqis have refused to abide by the cartels quota system 
which analysts have said is the biggest stumbling block to reaching 
a production accord 
thursdays meeting adjourned late in the day without any 
announcements and the ministers were not expected to convene again 
formally until saturday 
having started out with negative news and not being given any 
positive news during the day the market sagged under the 
pressure said mary l haskins assistant vice president at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
overproduction has depressed the price of crude by more than 25 
percent in 1988 below opecs 18 a barrel benchmark price 
opec is estimated to be producing more than 21 million barrels 
per day of oil and market analysts have said that the cartel must 
cut back to around 1718 million barrels to raise prices

for a currency as powerful as the dollar the prospect of it 
weakening or worse yet falling conjures up frightening 
images of economic collapse 
what does it mean when money is suddenly worth less 
and what is all this about buying and selling dollars for most 
of us dollars are used to buy things settle debts and reward 
children for good report cards the idea that the currency itself is 
a commodity whose value is determined on the open market is hard to 
fathom 
yet the buying and selling of dollars in foreign exchange markets 
is fundamental to establishing the value of a currency and that 
process is key to inflation and interest rates

economists suggest is it all depends

weight of gold and later to exchange rates of other major nations 
currencies but since then its price has floated determined by

traders in foreign exchange markets

steps can governments take to stabilize it 
a through two basic ways exchangemarket intervention and 
coordinated interestrate changes 
intervention is the direct buying or selling of currencies by 
central banks if the purchases are large enough that can influence 
prices directly when the fed or the bank of japan or the west 
german bundesbank buys dollars directly that reduces the supply of 
dollars available and sends up the price 
changes in interest rates affect exchange rates more subtly but 
generally high interest rates in the united states compared to low 
interest rates abroad will attract money to dollardenominated 
investments that raises the value of the dollar 
investors will flock to where they can get the highest return

metropolitan life insurance cos lawsuit over 
rjr nabisco inc managements giant buyout plan is one of the 
strongest signs yet that corporate bondholders are reconsidering 
their role in the multibillion dollar takeover frenzy fueled by 
borrowed money 
the lawsuit filed thursday by met life one of the biggest us 
insurance companies and a major holder of rjr nabisco longterm 
bonds alleges the risky 207 billion plan unfairly depressed the 
value of those bonds 
the suit came one day after itt corp sued rjr nabisco for 
related reasons 
met lifes action was considered significant because the insurer 
has made profitable investments in other debtfinanced takeover 
situations but is now reevaluating that strategy in light of the 
unprecedented rjr nabisco deal 
id say bond purchasers like investors in general may be 
looking at this activity as different from activities in the past 
david versfelt a lawyer who specializes in creditor litigation 
said in reaction to the lawsuit were in a new world and people 
are going to look at things differently 
at a news conference met life president john j creedon accused 
rjr nabiscos top managers of recklessly proceeding with a plan that 
if successful not only would enrich them and their investment 
bankers but also would quadruple the companys debt to 23 billion 
the prospect of that huge new debt has raised concern about the 
companys ability to pay existing bond obligations 
creedon said such concerns already had wiped 1 billion in market 
value from rjr nabisco corporate bonds including 40 million in 
losses for met lifes own portfolio of 340 million in nabisco 
longterm debt securities the lawsuit demands restitution of those 
losses 
rjr has gone to the well of public debt for many years and now 
theyre trying to poison it he said 
officials at rjr nabiscos headquarters in atlanta declined to 
comment on the suit saying the company did not comment on pending 
litigation 
the suit names as defendants both rjr nabisco and its chief 
executive officer f ross johnson johnson stunned the finance 
world last month by proposing a managementled leveraged buyout of 
the nations 19th largest industrial company which makes items 
ranging from winston cigarettes to ritz crackers 
a leveraged buyout is an increasingly popular highfinance 
transaction in which an acquirer uses borrowed money to buy all 
stock of a company and repays the debt through the companys 
earnings by asset sales or a combination of both 
such lbos often provide staggering profits for owners of a 
targets stock leaving a much smaller privatelyowned company 
saddled with a much higher debt load 
the size and complexity of rjr nabiscos planned buyout combined 
with the uncertain outlook for interest rates and the economy have 
incited criticisms that debtfinanced takeovers may have reached an 
excessive indiscriminate pace 
the met life lawsuit contended the rjr nabisco proposal has 
already resulted in a loss of confidence in the market for 
investment grade obligations of americas leading companies and is 
widely recognized as a threat to the integrity of our financial 
markets 
creedon told reporters he believes the frenzied level of 
leveraged buyouts could subvert americas capital formation system 
and that it warrants federal government scrutiny 
that is another reason met life felt compelled to take legal 
action he said 
its time to step back and look at the process he said 
were trying to send a message here 
responding to reporters questions creedon conceded met life 
itself had been an early investor in some leveraged buyouts some of 
which have done well he also said met life owns 186000 shares of 
rjr nabisco stock which has gained about 5 million in value since 
the leveraged buyout plans were disclosed in october 
of course what happened is the stock went up he said but 
whether or not it offsets the losses in bonds those are two 
different interests 
creedon also said met life was reevaluating its investment 
position regarding debtfinanced takeovers we will carefully 
consider lbos in the future with a more jaundiced eye he said

holly farms corp may have found a white 
knight buyer in conagra inc but a counterattack by hostile suitor 
tyson foods inc is not out of the question analysts say 
holly farms announced thursday the poultry processor had agreed 
to a 1 billion stock swap buyout by omaha nebbased conagra a 
major diversified food company 
the acquisition which must be approved by holly farms and 
conagra shareholders if successful would thwart the hostile 52 a 
share offer valued at 941 million being waged by tyson of 
springdale ark 
tyson issued a statement saying it would have no immediate 
comment on the proposal and analysts speculated it was not out of 
the picture yet 
i dont think its clear cut right now said napoleon 
overton an analyst with morgan keegan co in memphis 
conagra a diversified company with more than 60 percent of its 
business in prepared foods is offering an exchange of stock the 
value of which will be figured in january while tyson is offering 
cash now overton said 
tysons offer was to expire today but overton said tyson might 
be ready to raise it 
they definitely look like theyre willing to pay 54 a share in 
cash thats the key point no matter whether there is a formal bid 
on the table or not he said 
john mcmillin an analyst with predentialbache securities in new 
york said conagras offer would amount to 55 a share for holly 
farms 181 million shares of common stock based on thursdays 
market prices 
in trading on the new york stock exchange holly farms fell 87 
cents a share to 5187 while conagra dropped 125 a share to 
2762 
mcmillin said it was clear that holly farms management led by 
company president r lee taylor ii will continue to oppose tyson 
he said he believed that conagra had the upper hand because of 
its operating style in which each operating division is given wide 
autonomy 
market analysts say taylor and tyson chairman don tyson have 
different business styles and mcmillin said holly farms management 
likely would be replaced if tyson took over 
holly farms has 50 percent of its business in processed chicken 
and the conagra acquisition would push holly farms share of the 
branded chicken market from 18 percent to about 25 percent mcmillin 
said 
it gives a lot of clout within the supermarket he said 
tyson the nations largest poultry processer produces 14 
million pounds of chicken a week 
market observers say holly farms has been looking for a friendly 
takeover since tyson on oct 18 made its initial offer of 45 plus a 
quarter share of tyson stock for each holly farms share 
i would suspect that holly farms approached conagra overton 
said 
the acquisition agreement calls for exchanging 1875 to 2 shares 
of conagra stock for each share of holly farms stock holly farms 
has 181 million shares outstanding 
this transaction provides higher value for our shareholders 
significantly higher value than the other available alternative 
said ted bailey a spokesman for holly farms 
holly farms had total sales last year of 16 billion while 
conagra registered total sales of 95 billion tyson had sales of 
18 billion

pampered turkeys gobble to visitors and 
walk willingly into the slaughterhouse at kauffman poultry farms 
where farm operators say a happy bird is a tastier bird 
this 55yearold family farm will market about 60000 
thanksgiving and christmas holiday turkeys nearly all sold fresh to 
gourmet meat markets 
one of our claims to fame is that we do it all here taking 
good care of those little birds from day one said manager tom 
klopfenstein who has worked at this 600acre northcentral illinois 
farm for 23 years we know theyll end up a premium bird 
tiny turkeys spend their early days gathered around warm stoves 
then move outdoors for exercise and a lowfat diet that includes 
corn grown on the farm workers are with them daily until they reach 
market weight in about four months 
theres a reason for the pampered poultry klopfenstein believes 
reduced stress means better meat 
klopfenstein said many producers raise birds in confinement give 
them feed that produces more fat pack them into cages and truck 
them to slaughterhouses 
high school students walk turkeys into the slaughterhouse at 
kauffman poultry farms 
theyre not concerned about anything until we hang them on the 
line and then theyre dead in a few seconds said klopfenstein 
cleaned defeathered and wrapped these turkeys soon are on their 
way to meat markets around northern illinois or to kauffmans retail 
shop on the farm about 1000 turkeys are sold there at 129 a 
pound well over the typical price for a frozen supermarket turkey 
said klopfenstein 
they do a good job of marketing and promoting their product and 
people are willing to pay more for it said carl parsons a 
university of illinois poultry specialist 
but parsons says he doent agree with the theory that less stress 
on turkeys produces better meat 
klopfenstein said turkey production in the united states has 
increased because consumers believe turkey is healthier and cheaper 
than red meat the national turkey federation says per capita 
consumption has increased from 15 pounds in 1930 to about 165 
pounds in 1988 
klopfenstein said the biggest change has been rapid weightgain 
and large percentage of white breast meat due to genetic and feeding 
improvements 
us farmers earned 17 billion raising 240 million turkeys in 
1987 698000 of them in illinois the industry is dominated by 
major producers who market millions of birds each as everything from 
turkey ham and hotdogs to frozen whole turkeys 
howard kauffman raised the first hoka turkeys on the family farm 
in 1933 slaughtering them in his basement the farm now raises 
about 100000 turkeys a year 
ironically the heat and drought that cut crop yields this year 
helped the turkey business 
it fully sterilized the ground outside and inside the buildings 
and prevented diseases said klopfenstein

todays deadline for submitting bids to acquire 
rjr nabisco inc heightened the already brimming tension surrounding 
the buyout battle for the huge food and tobacco conglomerate 
the companys stock declined for the second straight session 
thursday amid rumors that one of two known bidders in the 
multibilliondollar takeover fight might end its campaign 
trading in rjr nabisco stock was halted on the new york stock 
exchange at 1 pm because the number of sell orders swamped buy 
orders trading resumed 34 minutes later when the order imbalance 
eased big board officials said 
the stock which lost 450 a share on wednesday finished down 
another 125 to finish at 8275 in heavy trading 
brokers said rumors surfaced that leveraged buyout specialist 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co might withdraw its 90ashare 203 
billion tender offer for rjr nabisco 
heightening the stock markets nervousness was todays bidding 
deadline imposed by the companys special committee of outside 
directors considering buyout offers 
kohlberg spokesman thomas daly said that the policy of the firm 
is not to comment on rumors in the marketplace 
speculators in rjr nabisco stock which has soared more than 40 
percent in value since the takeover battle began last month feared 
that kohlbergs withdrawal would leave only one bid left a 
92ashare 207 billion offer from the companys senior 
management 
many had been betting that kohlberg or an unidentified third 
party might make an even bigger offer 
rising uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of the biggest 
takeover attempt in history intensified wednesday when forstmann 
little amp co a key kohlberg rival in the takeover business that had 
indicated it led a group that might bid for rjr nabisco said it 
would not submit an offer 
the wall street journal said thursday that a bid might emerge 
from a group consisting of first boston corp and resource holdings 
ltd two new york investment firms neither would comment on the 
report 
securities analysts following the maneuvering said still there 
was some possibility that the rjr nabisco management group might 
join kohlberg to make a single bid although previous negotiations 
for such an alliance have collapsed several times 
rjr nabiscos president and chief executive officer f ross 
johnson who leads the managers trying to buy the company has the 
backing of the investment firms shearson lehman hutton inc and 
salomon brothers inc 
atlantabased rjr the nations 19th largest industrial concern 
makes such wellknown brands as winston and camel cigarettes oreo 
cookies and del monte vegetables 
if any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company it would be 
the biggest corporate acquisition ever the rjr nabisco management 
and kohlberg kravis bids dwarf the 134 billion spent in the 1984 
acquisition of gulf oil corp by what is now chevron corp

twentyfive years ago today atampt told 
americans to reach out and touch some buttons by introducing 
touchtone telephones 
the invention of the transistor in 1947 led to a 10year 
development period that culminated in the nov 18 1963 announcement 
that pushbutton telephone service would begin in two small 
pennsylvania communities carnegie and greensburg said bell 
laboratories spokeswoman maureen lynch in short hills 
we all thought it was pretty great stuff said jh ham who 
supervised the design and marketing of the phones for bell labs 
atampts research arm he spoke by touchtone phone from his home in 
indianapolis where he retired in 1984 after 42 years with atampt 
we all felt that we were on the forefront of a new service 
he said thursday 
fiftyfive percent of residential phones now are tone dial 
according to industry figures the rest are rotary or pushbutton 
phones that dial by pulse 
creation of the tone dialing system has led to other consumer 
technologies 
banks airlines railroads and other businesses have answering 
systems that allow callers to receive information or leave a message 
by pressing the appropriate digit tone phones also can be used to 
retrieve messages from some types of phone answering machines thus 
doing away with separate tone devices 
preceding the new services were years of complex research and 
testing in areas ranging from the proper type of tone to the 
arrangement of the pushbuttons on the phone itself 
atampt had experimented with pushbutton phones since the 1890s 
but the idea was first explored seriously in the early 1950s and 
researchers at bell labs developed the equipment from 1958 to 1961 
ham said at least two more years were required for final product 
development and testing 
the main development was the ability to send signals pitched 
tones while the connection was being made 
design of the phone itself included work by engineers and 
psychologists to find the button arrangement that would lead to the 
fastest and most accurate dialing 
a small difference in speed multiplied countless times over 
takes up more time in the phone network and thus costs more said 
blake wattenbarger the psychologist who supervises the human 
factors group at bell labs in holmdel 
researchers studied putting the buttons in a circle to mimic the 
rotary dial or in an upsidedown triangle they considered two 
columns either with odd on one side and even on the other or 15 
on the left and 69 and 0 on the right 
more than a dozen arrangements were tested until researchers 
settled on the present toptobottom rectangular arrangement said 
wattenbarger 
for the beep to register a digit at a central telephone facility 
a button must be held for at least onetwentieth of a second he 
said thus the buttons had to be designed to make sure the tone 
would sound long enough 
dialers also were found to prefer being able to hear the tones so 
they could know the signals were being transmitted and the tones 
had to be created so that the receiving equipment would not confuse 
them with the sound of a human voice wattenbarger said

supported by central bank intervention the us 
dollar today recouped some of its losses from the previous day when 
it dove to its lowest closing in tokyo against the japanese yen 
meanwhile stocks surged to another record high today 
the dollar finished the week at 12240 yen up 088 yen from its 
12152yen thursday closing it opened the day at 12215 yen and 
traded between 12207 and 12260 yen during the day 
coordinated overnight intervention by central banks around the 
world helped push the dollar up said king ogino a dealer at 
goldman sachs he said continued dollar buying by the bank of japan 
today also served to bolster the us currency 
the dollar has lost 348 yen in tokyo since the start of 
november and on thursday dipped to 12152 yen its lowest closing 
since modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940s 
the bank of japan intervention came after finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa said the central bank and other major currency countries 
were poised to intervene in the market should the us currency 
continue its nose dive 
ogino said the dollar also was buoyed by unconfirmed rumors from 
new york of an agreement at an alleged secret meeting nov 14 among 
highranking monetary authorities that the dollar should trade 
between 120 and 140 yen 
the report is unconfirmed but it had good timing to bolster 
the dollar he said 
but he said the dollar was likely to take another beating against 
the yen next week as speculators may test new lows for the 
currency 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
rose 10339 points or 036 percent to 2918020 the closing level 
was the sixth straight record high for the index 
dealers attributed the strong performance to confidence in 
japans economy todays rally was led mainly by large capital 
issues especially steels they said 
but the nikkei wont break the 30000point too soon one 
dealer said speaking on condition of anonymity

britains annual inflation rate jumped to 64 
percent in october from 59 percent in september pushed up by 
higher mortgage rates the government said friday 
however the gain was in line with forecasts by chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson and by analysts the financial markets 
relieved by the news had little reaction 
prime minister margaret thatcher has said fighting inflation 
which stood at 33 percent in january is her no 1 economic 
priority 
to curb prices the government drove interest rates significantly 
higher last summer with the commercial banks base lending rate 
going from a 10year low of 75 percent in june to the current 12 
percent and mortgage rates going up as well 
the department of employment said its retail price index rose 1 
percent in october from september after a 05 percent gain in 
september from the previous month 
the index which uses a 1987 base of 100 stood at 1095 in 
october compared with 1084 in september and 1029 in october 1987 
the department said the latest rise was mainly the result of 
higher mortgage interest payments following a round of 
mortgagerate hikes on oct 1 when the average rate of 115 percent 
rose to 1275 percent 
employment secretary norman fowler said the index excluding 
mortgage interest payments rose 51 percent in the year to october 
compared with an annual rate of 52 percent in september 
interest rates have had to be increased to constrain price 
rises but it will take time fowler said the government will 
continue to keep up the fight against inflation 
there were also price increases in clothing and footwear motor 
vehicles motor vehicle insurance and beer the government said

the travelers corp has scrapped its 
moneytrac personal financial management system after fewer than two 
years saying it couldnt sign up enough subscribers to justify its 
cost 
moneytrac was a onestop money management system offered by 
companies to their workers as a benefit for a 100 annual fee the 
system allowed workers to buy insurance apply for mortgages 
contribute to savings accounts and receive credit cards through 
travelers 
the fee was sometimes paid by the company sometimes by the 
worker and sometimes split between the two 
travelers spokesman robert obie refused thursday to give any 
details about how many individuals or companies had subscribed to 
moneytrac whether the product was profitable or how much money 
travelers had spent in its development 
that is proprietary marketing information and we are not able 
to release it obie said 
loss of the business caused lsge advertising inc in avon which 
handled advertising and public relations for moneytrac to lay off 
four of its 34 workers this week said gary lessner the firms 
chairman 
lessner said the account was worth about 2 million a year in 
billings to his agency which bills about 20 million annually

subscribers until their contracts expire

the european economic community reacted 
coolly friday to president reagans offer to soften the us 
position on agriculture subsidies at next months world trade talks 
in montreal 
a spokeswoman for the eec commission said the offer was not a 
fundamental change in the us desire to eliminate all farm 
subsidies 
reagan said thursday the united states would be flexible about a 
deadline for abolishing farm subsidies until now it had demanded 
such subsidies be stopped by the year 2000 
the commission spokeswoman said the eec seeks a reduction in farm 
subsidies over the long term not their complete elimination 
reagans speech was seen here as an attempt to ensure progress at 
the montreal talks due to begin dec 5 
the meeting will assess progress made to date in the fouryear 
uruguay round of trade liberalization talks within the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
that progress is to be discussed in weekend talks here between 
the us trade representative clayton yeutter us agriculture 
secretary richard lyng and top eec officials 
on friday yeutter and lyng discussed other contentious trade 
issues with their eec counterparts including eec plans to ban 
imports of hormonetreated meat from the united states as of jan 1

on saturday the talks will focus on the uruguay trade round of 
the gatt talks yeutter is in brussels after having meetings in

more than 30 investors who charged they lost 
millions of dollars because of unauthorized highrisk investments by 
dean witter reynolds inc have settled with the brokerage firm 
officials said friday 
the outofcourt settlement late last week came shortly after the 
resignation by the manager of dean witters boston office who along 
with a broker and the firm was the target of a lawsuit by a group of 
39 investors 
complaints against two other firms shearson lehman hutton inc 
and merrill lynch amp co are pending said samuel shafner an 
attorney for the plaintiffs 
the investors had filed lawsuits in us district court here in 
july against anoop k barman a broker allegedly responsible for the 
bulk of the transactions and against dean witter and merrill lynch 
where he worked from 1985 to 1987 
barman also worked for shearson and that firm is in settlemenmt 
negotiations although it has not been sued shafner said 
terms of the settlement with dean witter were not disclosed an 
attorney for dean witter confirmed only that a settlement had been 
reached 
shafner said two of the dean witter customers refused to settle 
and that their cases likely would be decided by a securities 
industry arbitration panel and not in court several other customers 
still are negotiating with the brokerage giant 
were very very pleased with all the settlement amounts with 
those who settled and the aggregate shafner said 
despite the settlement the state securities division is still 
investigating whether dean witter violated the massachusetts 
securities act said paul glickman the divisions chief of 
enforcement 
this will not change our investigation he said we expect 
to continue 
glickman confirmed that the probe focuses on whether the firm 
entered into trades above the investors financial capabilities and 
mishandled millions of dollars and whether supervision was adequate 
the investigation began after several investors complained to the 
state 
the securities act contains regulations governing investments by 
brokers in stock options that are beyond a customers means the 
probe involves dean witters boston and burlington offices and at 
least five executives including boston manager stephen j lozen 
who resigned last week 
lozen has refused comment on whether his departure was tied to 
the charges 
dean witter spokeswoman beth metzler said lozen resigned for 
personal reasons not related to the charges it was a voluntary 
decision on steves part to resign from dean witter she said 
not all of the 39 investors are involved in the cases against 
shearson and merrill lynch shafner said settlement negotiations are 
underway with shearson while merrill lynch has been served with a 
lawsuit in federal court 
in the suit barman is accused of violating state and federal 
securities laws fraud deception and mishandling accounts to try to 
generate larger profits and commissions in risky index options 
trading 
options are agreements that allow investors to buy or sell shares 
of stock within a stipulated time for a certain price barman 
allegedly traded in index options which are based on a package of 
shares that make up one of the major market indexes after clients 
specifically barred him from doing so

opec oil ministers huddled friday to break 
an impasse between iran and iraq that threatens to scuttle the 
cartels efforts to raise crude prices 
oil officials from the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries shuttled among three hotels in the austrian 
capital in search of a solution 
the oil ministers are trying to fashion a new production 
agreement that would limit output and push up prices which are 
running 4 or more below the cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
analysts have been skeptical about chances that the ministers 
would be able to come up with a strong agreement however 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh met for about 90 
minutes with officials from nigeria indonesia and venezuela 
i dont have anything new for you he told reporters after 
the meeting in the plush marriott hotel 
its too early to say something i hope we reach a 
solution he said 
iraqs oil chief issam abdul raheem alchalabi arrived at the 
hotel a few hours later for lengthy talks with the other ministers 
our position has not changed he said before the discussions 
opec secretarygeneral subroto the former indonesian oil 
minister said the meetings were taking place in a good 
atmosphere 
we are hearing several approaches that we are trying out he 
said there are many approaches to the problem and we should not 
totally follow one track 
he refused to offer any details 
he acknowledged the task was difficult 
we are realistic enough to understand that these problems we 
are facing are not easy ones he said 
at issue is iraqs insistence on being allowed under an opec 
agreement to produce the same amount of oil as rival iran iran has 
refused such parity 
the cartel sets quotas or ceilings on the amount of oil its 13 
members can produce 
the ministers are trying to arrange a new accord the current 
one dates to 1986 that would limit the recent surge in production 
that has added to the already glutted market 
iraq refused to join the current arrangement because of its 
demand for parity with iran 
since the two countries agreed to a ceasefire in august in their 
8yearold war efforts have been stepped up to try to bring iraq 
back into the opec quota system 
aghazadeh said he was still pressing for export parity with 
iran that refers to his proposal that the rivals be given the same 
quota for overseas sales 
but iran wants a higher overall ceiling to account for its 
greater domestic demand estimated at some 1 million barrels a day 
iraqi internal demand is put at about 300000 barrels a day 
analysts estimate that iraq has been producing at least 26 
million barrels a day the sum could soar to 37 million barrels 
next year with completion of a new pipeline through saudi arabia to 
the red sea its quota under the 1986 accord was 15 million barrels 
iran also is believed to have exceeded its quota of 24 million 
barrels 
the current production agreement sets total production at 15 
million barrels a day excluding iraq 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that the cartels production jumped to almost 211 
million barrels a day in october the highest monthly output in more 
than five years 
saudi arabia the worlds largest exporter has boosted its 
output to more than 6 million barrels a day analysts estimate well 
above its daily quota of 43 million barrels 
the behindthescenes talks were held throughout the day they 
followed a brief meeting thursday night of officials from eight opec 
countries who are members of two cartel committees 
the formal committee discussions were to resume saturday 
afternoon 
on monday all 13 oil ministers will gather for their winter 
meeting 
opec members include algeria saudi arabia nigeria indonesia 
venezuela iraq iran and kuwait 
others are ecuador gabon libya qatar and the united arab 
emirates

the cocacola co taking aim at a million offices 
too small for a conventional coke machine has introduced an 
alternative about the size of a microwave oven 
dubbed the breakmate the machine dispenses three different 
soft drinks into cups in a programmed portion size an onboard 
carbon dioxide tank turns tap water into carbonated water then the 
machine mixes carbonated water with drink syrup chilled by a small 
refrigeration unit 
the whole machine measures 22 by 11 by 18 inches and weighs 78 
pounds and if the boss is too cheap to spring for the cokes a 
coinoperated version is available 
coke estimates that 1 million us offices of 50 workers or less 
dont have soft drinks on the premises and the company hopes to 
eventually sell an extra 20 million gallons of syrup each year or 
about 24 billion drinks in the markets it cannot now reach 
the objective is to put breakmate wherever cocacola is not 
readily available to consumers cocacola usa president ira 
herbert said in a statement this week 
the company estimates that 20000 units will be in place by the 
end of the year with more than 40000 more installed in the united 
states next year distributors are currently on line in 25 us 
markets

more than a week after election day bond 
investors have yet to give presidentelect george bush their vote of 
confidence even though many had longed for a republican victory 
one reason is clear theres just too much uncertainty over how 
bush and a democraticcontrolled congress will tackle sticky 
economic problems such as the trade and budget deficits 
those questions have hurt the dollar in foreign exchange and 
that has had a domino effect on most bond prices and interest rates 
widespread buying of dollars by central banks around the world broke 
the currencys fall this past week but the general sentiment 
remains bearish 
the erosion of the dollar has sent some flow of capital out of 
our bond markets noted william v sullivan an economist for dean 
witter reynolds inc 
since election day bond prices have declined steadily with 
prices of some longterm treasury issues off nearly 20 per 1000 
face amount by friday and yields rising over 9 percent for the first 
time in more than a month 
the price decline was carried to other markets including those 
where corporate and municipal bonds are sold 
but the municipal market got some good news from election day 
traders said they were heartened by the fact that voters nationwide 
approved a record 138 billion in state and local bond issues that 
were on the ballots to finance projects ranging from road and bridge 
repairs to new prison facilities 
voters in a few other states also turned down severe antitax 
measures that would have crimped the states financial flexibility 
thereby hurting the credit ratings of bonds in those states 
neal atterman said positive results on both fronts indicate a 
greater support for the municipal market as a whole 
general concerns about the economy weigh most heavily on the 
secondary market for treasury issues 
even though the worldwide financial community had looked for 
the continuity of another republican president there hasnt been a 
great deal of enthusiasm said sullivan theres this deepening 
concern specifically among foreigners about what will go on 
between bush and the house and senate concerning the deficits 
investors worry that left unchecked gaps in the federal budget 
and balance of trade could ultimately damage the economy and for 
foreigners that makes the dollar less attractive 
a weaker dollar poses a threat of higher inflation which erodes 
the value of dollardenominated securities in addition to higher 
prices for imported goods a weak dollar can drive up domestic 
prices as foreign demand for us goods increases observed robert 
a brusca chief financial economist with nikko securities co 
international 
brusca and many other economists agree that the federal reserve 
wont just sit back and watch all this happen opting instead to 
push up interest rates to support the dollar and keep inflation in 
check that would further depress prices of loweryielding bonds in 
circulation

drawnout thing

force of sales representatives around the country 
canandaigua wine the fourth largest winery in the country has 
suffered millions of dollars of losses because of slumping sales of 
sun country wine cooler the product that catapulted the company 
into prosperity not too long ago 
sun countrys demise has been swift 
in november 1985 fueled by skyrocketing sales of sun country 
canandaigua reported record earnings of 95 million for the fiscal 
year ended aug 31 1985 and the companys stock soared to over 50 
a share 
two years later troubled by huge advertising expenditures and 
falling sun country sales the company reported a loss of 97 
million for fiscal year 1987 the company reported a loss of 48 
million for fiscal 1988 
on the american stock exchange canandaigua wine stock fell 12 
cents a share to 825 on friday 
we deeply regret the necessity of reducing our work force

actions will help us keep costs in line and maintain the company 
as a strong and vigorous competitor nationwide

the centralbank dollar buying marked the second straight day of 
massive coordinated currency intervention by the united states and 
its key trading partners traders said the dollars weakness

was a flight of capital it always would go into dollars that 
confidence is gone greene said if the central banks werent in 
there who knows how low the dollar would be now 
others said the aggressive level of centralbank dollar buying 
was only intended to stabilize the currency or ease its rapid fall 
since the nov 8 election of george bush to succeed president reagan 
until and unless the bush administration can create genuine 
interest in the dollar as an attractive currency money traders 
said it was highly likely the central banks would have to maintain 
a strong presence in the market to keep the dollar from dropping 
precipitously 
in tokyo the dollar rose 088 yen to close at 12240 yen later 
in london the dollar strengthened further to 12265 yen by 4 pm

officials of oberweis securities inc a 
midwest discount brokerage firm said friday they hoped to have 
enough capital to resume customer orders by next week 
the brokerage firm headquartered in this chicago suburb said 
thursday it had temporarily stopped accepting orders for securities 
although it continued to sell stock carry out options and conduct 
nonpurchasing business for existing accounts 
we can confirm for you the firm has ceased doing business 
said craig dearborn director of the national association of 
securities dealers incs chicago office 
clark galloway manager of the companys rockford branch said 
oberweis needed an additional 600000 and expected the money by 
monday at the latest 
its a oneday twoday problem at the most he said 
oberweis is solvent 
under nasd rules brokerages must keep reserves up to a certain 
level to continue doing business galloway said he did not know the 
dollar amount of the reserve requirement 
galloway said the capital problem was caused partly by the stock 
market crash last year and partly because of a recent acquisition 
some securities acquired in the purchase of a minnesota brokerage 
have declined in the last week pushing capital reserves to below 
acceptable levels he said 
barry weber a spokesman for the majority stockholder in 
oberweis told the chicago tribune that company capital fell below 
nasd requirements in part because misconduct by a former broker in a 
minneapolis office caused the firm hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in losses 
weber is vice chairman to ronald alghini a wealthy chicago 
investor who heads phoenix capital corp and who purchased a 
majority stake in oberweis in august the newspaper said 
at the time alghini said oberweis would undergo immediate 
restructuring and predicted the company which had suffered lean 
balance sheets in recent years would be highly profitable by 
december of this year 
weber declined to identify the individual he said was involved in 
the losing trades but said the broker was fired nov 4 after it was 
learned that he and possibly others had established large and 
unauthorized positions in four overthecounter stocks the tribune 
reported 
the unauthorized trading came to light after the market turned 
against the four positions forcing the firm to use its capital to 
cover the losses the newspaper said 
the trading reportedly involved selling stock short an 
arrangement in which the investor sells borrowed stock hoping its 
price would fall the tribune said 
officials of the company said thursday that customers accounts 
were safe 
there should be no repercussions said joe warnelis an 
oberweis investment executive we are not shut down but we have 
voluntarily restricted the level by which we do business we have 
taken steps to bring in additional capital 
all accounts at oberweis are insured up to 500000 by the 
security investors protection corp which is similar to the federal 
deposit insurance corp for banks said michael don deputy general 
counsel for the protection corporation in washington 
the protection corporation which charges securities dealers 100 
each to fund the insurance pool will reimburse investors up to 
100000 for cash accounts at a brokerage that goes bankrupt a 
total of 500000 can be reimbursed for cash and securities

silver futures prices slid to a 20month low on new yorks 
commodity exchange friday the fourth straight day of steep losses 
and analysts said the metal appeared to be headed below 6 a troy 
ounce 
it certainly looks like its going to try said stephen w 
platt metalmarkets analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
on other markets other precious metals also retreated while 
copper futures gained livestock and meat were lower grains and 
soybeans were mixed energy futures were mixed and stockindex 
futures advanced 
silver for delivery in december tumbled nearly 36 cents a troy 
ounce in the four sessions ended friday prices settled 11 cents to 
141 cents lower on friday alone with the december contract at 608 
a troy ounce the lowest comex silver price since march 27 1987 
metals experts cited a variety of factors for silvers sudden 
decline but all agreed that supplies of the metal were more than 
adequate and that the recent sharp rise in shortterm interest rates 
has had a depressing effect on demand from both the industrial and 
the investment sectors 
the dollars weakness since the nov 8 presidential election 
would ordinarily help prop up the precious metals because of its 
inflationary implications 
but the dollar going down hasnt been enough to offset the 
negative influence of the interest rates going up said craig 
sloane metals analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york 
sloane said the silver market actually had been weakening 
relative to gold for the last two months even though both metals 
had been trending higher since the start of october 
but the general decline in the precious metals during the past 
week kind of took away the camouflage he said 
gold and silver have a little reversal in place and i wouldnt 
be surprised to see it follow through sloane said i can see 
gold possibly testing the lows below 400 an ounce that it made in 
september and silver maybe breaking 6 and heading to 575 
bette raptopoulos metals analyst with prudential bache 
securities inc in new york said much of fridays silver decline 
was due to dealer selling of the physical metal on speculation that 
a monthold miners strike in peru was nearing its end and 
availabilty of silver soon would increase 
gold settled 270 to 380 lower with december at 41810 a troy 
ounce

1359 a pound

the seven largest cattleproducing states 
the report showed a 5 percent decline since last year in the 
number of cattle on feed as of nov 1 the number placed on feedlots 
in october and the number marketed off of feedlots last month 
all the numbers were slightly above market expectations were 
neutral to slightly bearish for futures prices morgan said 
live cattle settled 32 cent to 55 cent lower with december at 
7235 cents a pound feeder cattle were 50 cent to 80 cent lower 
with january at 8197 cents a pound live hogs were 117 cent lower 
to 08 cent higher with december at 4015 cents a pound and frozen 
pork bellies were 50 cent to 65 cent lower with february at 4307

corn and soybean futures ended modestly lower while most wheat 
futures advanced slightly in subdued trading on the chicago board of 
trade

the transportation department in another 
reversal announced friday that united airlines would retain the 
rights to fly the lucrative seattletokyo air route 
the decision was the latest twist in the twoyear battle over the 
100 million route that has involved united continental and 
american airlines 
this is our final decision said hal paris a transportation 
department spokesman adding that the white house already has 
approved the selection of united 
the department in making its decision found that the 
chicagobased united would offer more convenient service and would 
carry more passengers than would continental or american 
in addition the department found that uniteds extensive 
connecting service from tokyo to other far eastern cities gave it a 
substantial edge over the other two airlines seeking the route 
in large part because of these advantages united would be 
better able to compete with the other carriers now providing nonstop 
seattlejapan service the department said in a statement released 
with the 15page decision 
both northwest airlines and japan air lines also fly nonstop 
between seattle and tokyo 
while airline deregulation gave air carriers the freedom to fly 
wherever they want within the united states entry into overseas 
routes is still subject to government approval and limited by 
treaties with the other countries involved 
at various times over the past two years administrative law 
judges and top department officials have awarded the route to 
united continental and american 
most recently the transportation department said in late 
september that it would comply with a us appeals court decision 
awarding the route to continental 
but a month later the department anounced that it was 
reconsidering that decision 
besides united and american all 10 members of the washington 
state congressional delegation had urged the department to 
reconsider with most of the lawmakers urging that united retain the 
route 
united assumed the route in 1986 when it purchased pan american 
world airways pacific division but the department approved the 
purchase only on the condition that the seattletokyo route be dealt 
with in a separate proceeding 
united had warned that it might drop its seattlehong kong route 
and lay off many of its 2000 employees at seattletacoma 
international airport if it didnt retain the seattletokyo route a 
20 million expansion of united facilities at seattletacoma was put 
on hold pending a decision 
american officials had said their airline was prepared to build a 
new 100 million to 150 million hub at seattletacoma if it 
received the route 
american officials also said united wanted to retain the route 
just to block other airlines from gaining a foothold in the far 
eastern market united already flies between los angeles and tokyo 
and san francisco and tokyo 
continental officials had said their airline was prepared to 
slash fares to the far east if it received the route including 
oneway seattletokyo fares as low as 299

three unions at eastern airlines on friday 
formally asked for a preliminary injunction to block the 365 
million sale of its northeast shuttle service to real estate magnate 
donald trump 
the motion filed in us district court in washington by the 
international association of machinists the air line pilots 
association and local 553 of the transport workers union had been 
anticipated for a month 
us district judge barrington parker in october had scheduled a 
hearing on it for dec 2 giving eastern until nov 25 to file a 
response 
the three unions contended in the motion that the sale of the 
bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle violates the railway labor act as 
part of an attempt by easterns parent texas air corp to break 
the unions in the midst of collective bargaining on new contracts 
the sale is yet another attempt by texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo to dismantle eastern airlines said jack bavis head of 
the pilots union at the carrier theyve done nothing but squeeze 
out assets over the last two years the shuttle is one of the 
strongest links in easterns structure 
although the shuttle has been consistently profitable texas air 
contends the sale is necessary to raise cash for preserving the rest 
of eastern which has lost more than 300 million since 1986 
the shuttle deal is scheduled for completion on dec 15

burger king corp franchisees voiced strong 
opposition friday to a plan by the pillsbury co to spin off the 
fastfood chain as part of a defensive restructuring aimed at 
thwarting a hostile 523 billion takeover bid from britains grand 
metropolitan plc 
the national business planning council the official franchisee 
group said in a letter to burger king chairman jerry levin that the 
spinoff would add too much debt to the slumping company which is 
based in miami 
we strongly oppose this proposed course of conduct bn 
pothitous wrote on behalf of the council 
pothitous said the franchisee group cannot and will not 
support any restructuring that will restrict further investment and 
competitive growth in the chain 
levin who was at pillsbury headquarters in minneapolis friday 
afternoon said the letter confirms conversations he had with the 
franchisees throughout the week 
they informed us they were quite concerned with the level of 
debt in the models we showed them levin said we will explain 
those concerns and issues to our board of directors 
levin would not say when the directors will meet again he said 
he presented only one restructuring model to the franchisees 
he said franchisees made a lot of good points and we learned a 
lot during the week of meetings 
the franchisees also met this week with officials from grand met 
the british liquor gambling and specialty products conglomerate has 
said it would invest money in burger king and streamline its 
operations if the takeover bid is successful 
the fastfood chain accounted for 191 billion of pillsburys 
619 billion sales in fiscal 1988 operating profits for the year 
were 482 million at burger king while net earnings for pillsbury 
were 69 million or 81 cents a share 
grand mets 60 a share tender offer has been extended three 
times the offer was set to expire again at midnight friday but 
could be extended monday 
pillsburys board of directors rejected the allcash tender offer 
as inadequate on oct 17 and later announced the plan to spin off 
burger king into a separate public company pillsbury shareholders 
would receive stock in the new burger king which would issue a 
special shareholder dividend the size of which has not been 
disclosed 
grand met and dissident shareholders are suing pillsbury to 
invalidate the companys poison pill takeover defense and to 
block the spin off of burger king the pill would make a takeover 
prohibitively expensive and a newly separate burger king would 
present a huge tax liability for grand met if a takeover is 
successful according to the lawsuits 
pillsbury chairman philip smith has refused offers to meet with 
grand met officials to negotiate the tender offer smith has said 
pillsbury shareholders would be better off in the long run under the 
restructuring being proposed by the board of directors 
pillsbury stock closed friday at 5725 a share in composite new 
york stock exchange trading 
meanwhile pillsbury on friday named c ronald petty as president 
and chief operating officer of burger king 
levin said franchisees have an enormous amount of respect for 
rons talents and a high degree of confidence that he will provide 
strong leadership in the new position 
petty 44 has 15 years of experience in the fast food industry 
including stints with burger king usa burger king international and 
the real estate division of mcdonalds restaurants 
grand met spokesman walter montgomery said the british company is 
pleased but not surprised by the franchisees opposition to the 
burger king plan he said grand met remains confident the tender 
offer will prevail
