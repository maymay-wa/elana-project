an employee of texas billionaire h ross perot 
carried a letter from white house aide oliver l north giving him 
presidential authority for transporting 100000 to canada as part 
of a plan to free a us hostage in lebanon according to a 
published report 
north sent the courier jay coburn to canada in january 1986 
with a letter on national security council stationery that said 
coburn is acting on official us government business on behalf 
of the president of the united states according to a copy of the 
letter obtained by the washington post 
in support of this mission he has the authority to transport 
and disburse as necessary us 100000 the letter said in 
the event of emergency or clarification please contact oliver l

peter c kilburn the librarian at the american university in 
beirut who was kidnapped dec 3 1984 kilburn was killed by a 
libyan terrorist group in april 1986 in apparent retaliation for 
the us bombing of libya 
coburn needed the north letter in case us customs service 
agents stopped him at the border the post said in fridays 
editions travelers must file a disclosure statement if they take 
more than 10000 out of the country failure to file is punishable 
by up to 250000 in fines and five years in prison 
the post said coburn has told associates that he filed no 
disclosure statement and planned to rely on norths letter if he 
ran into trouble at the border 
coburn got into canada without difficulty and in montreal he 
gave the money to a canadian citizen who had provided proof of 
contact with kilburns captors the canadian said the 100000 was 
a down payment and that with it he could arrange kilburns release 
for 1 million more said the post which did not identify the man 
the canadian contact took the money but never came through with 
his end of the deal and was later observed by the cia in damascus 
spending the money on high living the post said citing 
unidentified sources for the information

thenfbi director william h webster who is now cia director 
approved the fbis participation in the plan the newspaper said

three men in red academic robes and mortarboards 
walked across the platform at boston university to receive their 
masters degrees and later walked back into prison 
steven kelleher robert layne and gene perry inmates at the 
mediumsecurity bay state correctional center in norfolk became 
the first masters recipients under a 16yearold prison education 
program 
you begin to see your relationship with society and what you 
owe to it said kelleher 36 in the seventh year of a 12 to 
20year sentence for armed robbery it puts everything in a 
different light 
layne 41 serving two consecutive terms for possession of a 
firearm and receiving stolen property said higher education leads 
to more responsible action in society 
life is decision making said layne bad decisions put you 
in jail the more complex and complicated the decision the more 
education is needed to make the right choice 
it was tough to study after being away for all those years 
said perry 41 who has served eight years for seconddegree 
murder but after i got the hunger to learn it was something 
that just took over 
all three bestowed master of liberal arts degrees wednesday 
got their undergraduate degrees in prison and each expressed a 
desire to perform counseling or social work once free 
the three graduates join about 60 other degree recipients in the 
program which has served more than 500 inmates at the medium 
security state prison at norfolk prison and the adjacent minimum 
security correctional center with classes from high school 
equivalency to postgraduate 
this is the true model for education for all said elizabeth 
ma barker a bu professor emeritus and founder of the schools 
prison program this is truly education befitting all free men 
bu pays for textbooks and teacher salaries and the state 
subsidizes tutition for the inmates in 1985 the nonprofit 
massachusetts council on prison education was formed representing 
11 higher education institutions offering classes to inmates 
including bu and curry college in milton 
bu president john silber told the nearly 100 friends family and 
educators at wednesdays ceremony that some consider the program an 
unnecessary frill 
these are individuals who society deemed not worthy of being 
free said silber through education they become useful 
citizens catering to the society they depend on they are earning 
their right to be free

dust was in the air as west texans coped 
with the annual onslaught of earth wind and fiery sandstorms 
the season usually begins in midmarch and ends in may april is 
the windiest month and the driven dust can sandblast car 
finishes damage skin and hair and make life miserable for allergy 
sufferers and people with respiratory illnesses 
el paso suffered through its first dust storm of the year a week 
ago once again meeting a timetable as old as the desert and texas 
south plains 
the seasons high winds and dry weather combined with 
plowedunder fields make lubbock particularly dusty this time of 
year said andy anderson meteorologist in charge at the national 
weather service there 
everything unfortunately seems to work in harmony he said 
conditions are similar in the desert of the transpecos where 
moisture is scarce and the dust easily swirls in the warm winds 
its so windy in the panhandle that amarillo high schools 
mascot is the sandstorm the schools sports teams are known as the 
amarillo high sandies 
wind picks up in spring because of uneven heating of the earth 
causing fronts and upperlevel disturbances said howard wheless of 
the weather service office here 
were going from winter to summer wheless said its just 
a cycle that mother nature goes through 
its also a cycle that allergy sufferers have to go through at 
the el paso allergy and asthma center business picks up about 15 
percent to 20 percent during dust storm season said spokesman jon 
kersey 
were seeing a lot of people come in he said they 
complain of allergic rhinitis asthma wheezing tightness in the 
chest 
allergic rhinitis is another way of saying hay fever 
the windblown dust pits windshields and scratches car finishes 
but the bodyrepair business doesnt increase much during dust 
storm season said enrique medina president of spraymaster paint amp 
body in el paso 
imogene johns manager of aladdin beauty college in el paso 
said she like most people procrastinates when it comes to 
protecting her hair and skin this time of year 
knowing better ill wait till its too late she said 
she said people should use skin moisturizers and hair 
conditioners to keep those ends from being whipped up in the 
sand 
once it hits taking care of it later is kind of like running 
out after the horse is out and shutting the barn door she said

senate majority leader robert byrd on 
wednesday called president reagans plan to send 3200 us troops 
to honduras an overreaction to the movement of nicaraguan 
forces into that country 
other legislators were more cautious in their reaction to the 
white house announcement that us troops were being dispatched for 
what presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater termed a measured 
response designed to show our staunch support to the democratic 
government of honduras 
i just hope its merited sen john kerry dmass said 
recalling a similar incident two years ago when the united states 
leaped to the aid of honduras under circumstances many saw as 
exaggerated by the white house i hope this is not an 
overreaction 
a contra supporter sen john mccain rariz said he would 
reserve judgment on the wisdom of reagans decision but that 
us combat involvement did not appear to be warranted 
i think that its clear that the honduran government sought a 
show of support from the united states mccain said i believe 
these troops are not and must not be put into combat and to some 
degree it will shift the focus from what the sandinistras are doing 
to what our troops will be doing down there 
house minority leader robert michel rill appeared supportive 
of the decision and said it was intended psychologically to give 
an indication that we are not just going to stand by and have 
nicaragua make incursions into neighboring countries 
but byrd dwva said the administration was going too far 
its an overreaction he said the sandinistas have 
crossed over the border before and gone back 
jason isaacson a spokesman for sen christopher dodd dconn 
said the senator saw the administratoin action as an effort to 
divert attention from the irancontra indictments and to turn up 
the heat on congress for more aid to the contras 
rep jack fields rtexas said i dont think the president 
really had an alternative to sending the troops to nicaragua 
the purpose is for them to demonstrate our commitment to 
regional peace and stability fields said i lay the blame for 
the president having no alternative at the feet of house speaker 
jim wright and the democrats who scuttled the contra aid package 
earlier wednesday before the troop action was announced wright 
dtexas said nicaragua already was ordering its troops back from 
the incursion into honduras and that plans for resumption of 
ceasefire talks with the contra rebels next week remain on track 
wright said if those developments in fact occur the seriousness 
of the crossborder fighting will be greatly minimized and will 
have little impact on the political climate in congress toward 
further aid for the rebels 
but he said the reverse is also true that aid prospects could 
improve if sandinista troops do not withdraw 
wright said word of the order for sandinista troops to pull back 
had been relayed to him by nicaraguan foreign minister miguel 
descoto who also said president daniel ortega was asking the 
united nations to send an observer group to the border area 
at the same time others in congress were skeptical about 
administration portrayal of the incursion as a genuine national 
security problem for the united states as secretary of state 
george shultz described it 
they have cried wolf so many times even supporters of 
contra aid are somewhat skeptical said sen patrick leahy 
dvt an aid opponent it is apparently a major raid on a contra 
camp in the jungles now that does not pose a threat to honduras 
or its capital 
i think you have to ask the question of whether 1200 
nicaraguans going across the honduran border is a threat to us 
national security said majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
in this situation there is questionable trust in the 
activities of the white house and the state department coelho 
said 
wright said he still does not believe support exists in congress 
for any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels and repeated 
that congressional democrats remain willing to talk about a further 
package of purely humanitarian aid 
but he did question the judgment of ortega in mounting the 
military action on the border i would have preferred certainly 
that no armed forces of any country enter into the territory of 
another country wright said 
meanwhile partisan warfare broke out on the house floor after 
democrats accused republicans of abandoning the nicaraguan contra 
rebels and a gop lawmakers microphone was cut off during an angry 
response 
in a floor speech coelho triggered a verbal brawl when he said 
the rebels had supported a democratic aid package which was 
narrowly defeated on march 3 but were ordered by the white house 
not to lobby in favor of it 
republicans overwhelmingly voted against the 30 million 
humanitarian aid bill 
we now know the truth coelho said the republicans 
abandoned the contras to the politics of cynicism 
coelhos remarks drew shouts of shame shame from the 
republican side of the chamber and rep robert dornan rcalif 
rose a few minutes later to condemn coelho and wright 
in 10 years jim and tony i have never heard on this 
floor so obnoxious a statement as i heard from mr coelho dornan 
said thanks to the radical and liberal leadership in this house 
the communists are winning a major victory 
dornan referred to the white house assertion that nicaraguan 
troops had crossed the border into honduras seeking to destroy 
contra supply centers and to deal a death blow to the rebels 
under house rules members are allowed to speak for up to one 
minute on any subject before the chamber begins its business each 
day dornans heated remarks continued past the twominute mark 
and rep gary ackerman dny presiding in the speakers chair 
sought to gavel him down 
dornan shouting and pounding on the podium continued to speak 
however to cheers and applause from republican colleagues 
apparently at ackermans request dornans microphone was cut off 
so that there was no longer any sound on the house television 
system 
that brought renewed outrage from the gop side which already 
has a longsimmering feud with the democratic leadership over what 
they consider heavyhanded tactics used to control proceedings in 
the chamber 
rep judd gregg rnh objected that ackerman was not acting 
in accord with house rules and was attempting to close down the 
process of free speech 
ackerman responded that dornan had greatly exceeded the limit 
and abused the privilege of oneminute speeches and that he 
simply was trying to maintain house decorum and order

years of hiccuping according to a report published today her 
hiccuping stopped after doctors gave her a drug to treat her newly 
diagnosed parkinsons disease

with rare remissions lasting a maximum of six to eight weeks the 
doctors wrote even during the periods of remission sporadic 
hiccups were observed she had been hospitalized several times and 
had undergone a great many tests 
the hiccups immediately stopped when she got the drug amantadine 
for parkinsons disease the doctors theorize that the disease was 
somehow responsible for the hiccups

a gangster was convicted wednesday 
of murdering a chineseamerican journalist on orders from the 
taiwanese government 
a jury deliberated 45 minutes before returning the firstdegree 
murder verdict against tung kueisen a member of the international 
united bamboo gang in the 1984 slaying of henry liu liu was shot 
to death in his garage 
tung 36 claimed he shot liu for patriotic reasons believing 
he was killing a traitor 
liu had written articles critical of the taiwanese government 
the 52yearold journalist also had written about the personal life 
of the late nationalist chinese leader chiang kaishek behavior 
considered indecent in taiwan 
tung who is serving a 20year sentence for heroin trafficking 
could receive 25 years to life in prison in the liu slaying he 
also faces up to two years in prison for use of a firearm 
sentencing was set for may 11 
tung had insisted on a trial because prosecutors refused to 
offer a plea bargain and because he wanted to tell his story said 
defense attorney douglas gray 
earlier wednesday tung testified the plot to kill liu went as 
high as the son of thenpresident chiang chingkuo the son at the 
time was head of taiwans secret police the president died in 
january 
tung is the only one of lius suspected killers to be brought to 
trial in the united states 
wang hsiling a taiwanese vice admiral was convicted earlier 
in taiwan of orchestrating the plot two aides also were convicted 
in the slaying as were two other bamboo gang members all five 
received life sentences 
the taiwanese government had refused to extradite the gangsters 
to the united states for trial tung was arrested in rio de janeiro 
a year after the slaying 
wang wanted liu killed before liu was about to publish the 
memoirs of a former highranking taiwanese official something wang 
feared would be embarrassing and damaging to president chiang 
assistant district attorney bob bishop said 
the suspected gunmen in the case had fled the united states and 
surfaced in taiwan believing they were immune from prosecution 
bishop said 
the slaying strained relations between the united states and 
taiwan and the united states began putting so much pressure on 
chiangs regime that something had to be done bishop told the 
jury 
in his testimony tung said he believed he was duped by his own 
government into killing a man who was not a traitor liu asked in a 
written statement sent to the judge wednesday that a written 
apology be given to helen liu the victims wife 
tung confessed to his role in lius killing two years ago during 
his drug smuggling trial in new york he was found guilty of 
smuggling 660 pounds of heroin into the united states

despite promising preliminary results physicians 
should not routinely use a transplant drug to treat childhood 
diabetes until experts learn its longterm safety and 
effectiveness doctors cautioned today 
a report by french doctors is the latest in a series of studies 
demonstrating that the drug cyclosporine seems to help victims of 
juvenile diabetes also known as type 1 or insulindependent 
diabetes 
the report showed that half of the youngsters treated with the 
drug did not need insulin shots one year after their therapy began 
the study was conducted by dr pf bougneres and colleagues at 
st vincent de paul hospital in paris and published in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
an accompanying editorial noted that cyclosporine can harm the 
kidneys and is not an ideal drug 
we believe that it is still premature to advocate the use of 
cyclosporine for patients who are not enrolled in clinical trials 
in which the response to treatment and adverse effects are 
carefully monitored wrote drs kevan c herold and arthur h 
rubenstein of the university of chicago 
cyclosporine suppresses the bodys immune system it is widely 
used after transplants to prevent rejection of the new organ 
although cyclosporine has been the subject of studies by several 
research groups in recent years experts still do not know the 
longterm effects and hazards of the drug when used to treat 
juvenile diabetes 
the national center for health statistics estimates that about 7 
percent of all americans are diabetic the disease is the 
underlying cause of 36000 deaths each year 
usually the disease strikes during adulthood and can be 
controlled without insulin shots only about one in 10 diabetics 
has the juvenileonset form of the disease which usually destroys 
the bodys ability to make insulin people with the juvenile form 
face an increased risk of such complications as blindness heart 
disease and kidney failure 
in the french study 40 youngsters with recently diagnosed 
diabetes were treated with cyclosporine the researchers found that 
twothirds were in remission after four months and half after 12 
months 
those helped by the drug started getting treatment an average of 
three weeks after diagnosis those for whom it failed started 
therapy seven weeks after diagnosis

a prosecutor in the racketeering trial of rep 
mario biaggi told the judge that another congressman was bribed and 
that wedtech corp founder john mariotta was the prime mover in 
the alleged bribery it was disclosed wednesday 
rep robert garcia dny the second congressman has not been 
charged with any crime his attorney robert morvillo said 
wednesday that the congressman was aware that his activities were 
being investigated and had denied any wrongdoing 
mariotta is a codefendant in the trial of biaggi a bronx 
democrat involving alleged bribery of public officials by wedtech 
a defunct defense contractor 
in another development a key government witness testified that 
biaggi sought 5 percent of wedtechs stock and a 5 percent cut of 
all government contracts that he and his law partner helped the 
company get 
the witness former wedtech vice chairman mario moreno 
testified that in the summer of 1982 he and mariotta met with 
biaggi at a restaurant and the congressman indicated he wanted 5 
percent of every contract that he could help bring into the 
company 
biaggi also wanted 5 percent of wedtechs soontobe issued 
stock moreno said 
he testified that mariotta later agreed to the deal but his 
partner fred neuberger opposed it and got into a heated 
argument with biaggi at a later meeting in july 1982 
we have done a lot for this company moreno quoted biaggi as 
telling neuberger this company is where it is because of the 
services we provided to you 
the prosecutors statement about mariotta was revealed in the 
transcript of a tuesday morning conference in us district judge 
constance baker motleys robing room before the start of the days 
court session 
as to congressman garcia assistant us attorney mary 
shannon told the judge it is the governments contention that 
mr mariotta was the prime mover in the bribery of congressman 
garcia 
in the conference mariotta lawyer jeffrey glekel complained 
bitterly that prosecutors planned to elicit testimony about 
wedtechrelated crimes from a key government witness who is not 
charged in the case on trial 
the witness mario moreno is one of four former wedtech 
executives who have admitted bribing public officials and agreed to 
testify in a plea bargain with state and federal prosecutors 
the integrity and reliability of the four former executives were 
attacked by several defense lawyers in opening statements to the 
jury monday 
countering glekels arguments in the robing room session ms 
shannon told the judge we told mr glekel that while we would 
elicit from mario moreno that he had knowledge of and participated 
in the bribery of congressman garcia we wouldnt go beyond that 
nor would we bring out any details 
the judge asked now you plan to bring out details is that 
what you are saying 
to the extent that mr mariotta was involved yes said ms 
shannon just to bring out his involvement again not to 
substantively prove that particular crime 
prosecutors said they were entitled to bring out the other 
alleged crimes because of the opening statements by defense lawyers 
the transcript and court proceedings did not indicate whether 
the judge would allow the testimony 
moreno a former vice chairman of wedtech continued his 
testimony wednesday elaborating on how another defendant former 
bronx borough president stanley simon got his brotherinlaw a 
fourdayaweek job with the company 
moreno said simon told him his brotherinlaw henry bittman 
needed to take off one day a week he had to sign in at a 
state job a noshow job

request because they needed his help in getting city approval for a

hello dear youre very handsome yes you are 
sir alec guinness coos through the cage at a rhinoceros 
youve got a sweet face very pretty ears the elder 
statesman of british acting says as he strolls through berlins 
central zoologischen garten 
his chat with the animals is almost as engaging as the wonderful 
characters he has portrayed on stage and screen during five decades 
as one of the worlds finest most chameleonlike talents 
on this particular day the berlin film festival was awarding 
the 73yearold guinness its special ehren bear honorary bear 
for lifetime achievement in the cinema the actor however elected 
to avoid the morning crush of screenings and news conferences for a 
romp in the zoo 
im not actually that keen on them i hate to see certain 
animals caged up he said 
but i remember this zoo being small and very imaginatively 
laid out on the open plan and i thought it might be amusing to 
have a second look he last visited the zoologischen garten 14 
years ago 
images of some of the zoos reported stock of 10000 animals 
have lingered they used to have white rhinoceroses there that 
were charming and a great sea lion covered in shrapnel wounds an 
old thing that was like a symbol of berlin a splendid great 
creature 
this time around guinness observations are as keen as ever 
whether applied to the varieties of zoobound species or the 
special tributes that have marked his career 
in 1980 he received a special academy award to honor a range of 
work encompassing such portrayals as the sinister fagin in oliver 
twist 1948 a comic octet of murder victims in kind hearts 
and coronets 1950 the harddriving colonel nicholson in the 
bridge on the river kwai 1957 the aging mystic ben obiwan 
kenobi in star wars 1977 and its sequels 
last year he was twice feted in lavish galas in april at new 
yorks lincoln center and in may at the cannes film festival 
the occasion in berlin may be less tony but its significance is 
no less clear in the festivals 38 years guinness is only the 
second actor to be so honored following james stewart in 1982 
im afraid when you get rather elderly these things seem to 
come on you rather more than you might wish he says his brisk 
gait belying his years his nose becoming slightly red in the 
seasonal chill 
a signpost draws his attention i think that way may be the 
pheasantry do you mind if we go in there 
somewhere between pheasants and finches the conversation turns 
to work his latest project is little dorrit the sixhour film 
adaptation of charles dickens novel in which he plays william 
dorrit a longterm inmate of a debtors prison who finds that 
sudden wealth brings sudden freedom 
guinness had not performed dickens since the 1940s when he both 
adapted great expectations for the stage and made his movie 
debut as herbert pocket in david leans 1946 film version he then 
appeared in oliver twist in 1948 he considers little 
dorrit to be one of dickens two or three greatest novels 
dickens offers great temptations for actors because you can go 
over the top he said 
later this year hell be seen as mr todd in a movie of evelyn 
waughs 1934 novel a handful of dust then theres lee 
blessings current broadway play a walk in the woods which 
guinness may do on the london stage he last trod the west end 
boards in alan bennetts the old country in 19778 
its a very distinguished piece of writing he says of the 
play but guinness acknowledges its pitfalls as well the amount 
of learning for a twohander is horrendous an actors great fear 
is that he wont have the memory 
on that topic he is emboldened by the recent return to the 
stage after a decade away of his friend and mentor sir john 
gielgud in the new play the best of friends 
gielgud is 83 guinness says matteroffactly and he got 
through it the play very successfully 
by now the sky has clouded over and rain looks likely 
guinness has a lunch date for which he mustnt be late so he 
returns to his hotel to find that autograph hunters have arrived 
there they are he says sounding resigned as the anonymity 
of the walk in the zoo gives way to the fans everready pens and 
cameras 
but before leaving the zoo he has one last remark about rhinos 
were told they have very nice personalities 
he takes an inimitable pause but i dont think id like to 
encounter them intimately

three decades after the irish 
government evacuated his weeping father and the few other people 
who remained on the tiny blasket islands mike carney says the 
exiles are flourishing in their landlocked new home 
theres more of us here than in ireland said the happy 
emigrant from the harsh life that ended abruptly in 1955 with the 
closing of the islands off the western tip of the dingle peninsula 
carney 67 is among the last surviving natives of the 
fivemilelong main island that preserved 18thcentury language and 
customs into the middle of the 20th century when the government 
deemed the land too dangerous to inhabit 
now he makes his home among an estimated 50 other natives in 
springfields hungry hill district 
in ireland they lived in a precapitalist society in some of 
the most treacherous waters of western europe said thomas biuso 
an english professor at colbysawyer college in new london nh 
on thursday carney plans to join other islanders for the citys 
st patricks day parade and a drink at the john boyle oreilly 
club a far cry from the celebrations of his youth on the 
westernmost point of europe 
here there is more of a parade its more showoff here he 
said back there we would go pick a shamrock in the fields to 
wear in green caps if we could we would go to the mainland to 
watch the horse races 
getting to the mainland three miles away in handmade canoes was 
always precarious because of oftenthreatening weather which 
seemed to worsen by the mid1900s carney said 
bad weather kept his family from bringing his brothers body to 
the mainland for burial for three days after his death in the 
winter of 1947 neither a doctor nor a priest could be summoned 
because of the storm 
the islands apparently were too remote even for a bull brought 
from the mainland for breeding the bull swam the three miles home 
carney said 
the islands remoteness however ensured the preservation there 
of an ancient social organization which included a king and a 
council of elders and of the gaelic tongue carney said 
gaelicspeaking mainlanders have difficulty understanding islanders 
because we speak so fast 
no one knows when the first mainlanders settled on the blaskets 
or when the islanders began emigrating to the united states but 
biuso said they apparently left in the mid1800s to work on the 
railroad running through massachusetts 
carneys father went to the united states three times but always 
returned i guess he got homesick carney said 
carney was 16 when he left for dublin where he worked as a 
bartender for 10 years before coming to springfield 
i could not see myself battling the atlantic ocean for a 
living he said you could be captive on the island for a month 
without being able to go to the mainland to get food it looks 
beautiful yes but to operate there thats a different story

the writer bureau chief for the associated 
press in mexico city was among three ap journalists detained at 
gunpoint wednesday at defense forces headquarters in panama city 
but later released here is his account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
yes we are also simulating arrests 
said the captain as i nodded toward a somberlooking military man 
being led away by soldiers at gunpoint 
this is merely an exercise the captain added 
but it was no exercise 
it was an attempted coup by a group of young officers led by 
police chief col leonidas macias who tried to take over the 
defense forces headquarters wednesday and overthrow gen manuel 
antonio noriega the military chief 
this reporter accompanied by ap radio reporter pauline jelinek 
and ap photographer diana smith had been forced out of our car at 
gunpoint by soldiers in full battle gear when we tried to stop in 
front of the defense froces headquarters 
we drove there following reports that a group of officers had 
tried to take over the installation soldiers had cordoned off the 
street in front of headquarters 
as we tried to park near a checkpoint soldiers noticed the 
photographers cameras and started banging on the doors of the car 
they stuck their guns through the windows and yelled get out 
they took cameras tape recorders and car keys i identified 
myself as a newsman and was asked which country we told him 
the united states the government and the panamanian news media it 
controls daily accuse american news media of distorting information 
i insisted we should be allowed to leave but was forced to lean 
on the car for a search and then a sergeant said take them 
inside 
we were forced to walk one long block at gunpoint by two 
soldiers who kept urging us not to look back and just keep on 
walking past a big patio where an infantry company was listening 
to a speech by an officer and into the large yard between 
headquarters and the barracks of the elite urraca infantry unit 
anything going on i asked our escort 
just shut up and keep walking there is nothing going on move 
and dont look back he replied 
we saw armed civilians and military moving around then a 
captain came in and told our escort just calm down he turned 
to us and explained this is just a routine exercise 
you mean you simulate reaction in case of an attempted coup 
i asked 
thats right the captain said 
it was then we saw about four civilians and military men lead an 
officer his shirt hanging out head bowed and hands behind his 
head into the barracks 
yes we are also simulating arrests the captain added 
they were taping and taking pictures our escort said to the 
captain 
take the tape and the film the captain said 
the exercise is over you can go you can pick up your gear 
tomorrow the captain told us 
after i insisted we need the equipment right away he agreed to 
let us have it back 
later on a soldier brought our car on the way out i saw 
several other civilians standing while other armed civilians 
removed pistols from their belts 
for an exercise it was very realistic

two swarms of socalled killer bees were 
discovered on the waterfront earlier this month in a leaking 
shipment of honey from guatemala but were apparently trapped and 
destroyed authorities said wednesday 
we have begun a twoweek trapping program at the wharf to 
ensure none escaped however said state agriculture commissioner 
bob odom 
africanized or killer bees are more aggressive than the 
domestic honey bee since they take over other hives they are 
considered a threat to the us honey industry 
the bees were taken from africa to south america where they 
escaped in the 1950s they have been advancing northward since 
then but their movement is believed to have been stopped near 
tehuantepec south of mexico city 
odom said customs officials spotted them buzzing around two 
containers 
the swarms were destroyed the queens were found said tom 
rinderer director of the lousiana state university laboratory that 
is the federal governments main research center on africanized 
bees 
thats an important discovery this is a complete destruction 
no question about it he said 
rinderer said most of the bees were workers which are not 
involved in reproduction if one or two of them got loose it 
doesnt mean a thing he said 
the shipment on which the bees were found originated in el 
salvador said state entomologist john impson 
odom said that killer bees have been found in florida and 
california but officials believe the swarms were contained

nicaragua mobilized its troops and 
appealed to citizens to help the army wednesday after the united 
states announced it was sending soldiers to honduras for a training 
exercise the official radio said 
the government did not confirm reports from honduras and 
washington that sandinista troops pursued usbacked contra rebels 
into honduran territory during an offensive in northern nicaragua 
however president daniel ortega said fighting was raging along 
the border and that there was cross fire from honduran territory 
against our forces 
this is the hour in which the nicaraguan people must place 
themselves at the orders of the sandinista army the government 
radio network said late wednesday 
it said troops were being mobilized throughout the country and 
demonstrators took to the street in the southern town of rivas 
near the costa rican border to protest the dispatching of us 
troops to honduras 
the radio called honduran president jose azcona hoyos request 
for us military help just a disguise since these troops could 
well come into nicaragua this is certainly the intention and they 
will do it at any moment 
but they will not catch the nicaraguan people sleeping the 
radio network said 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states was sending 3200 soldiers to southern honduras to 
carry out training exercises and to be a signal to the 
governments and the people of central america he said they would 
not enter any combat zones 
foreign minister carlos lopez contreras of honduras said 
wednesday night that azcona contacted ortega to demand the 
withdrawal of the sandinista troops honduran military intelligence 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press that honduran troops had surrounded about 2000 nicaraguan 
soldiers near the border 
in costa rica president oscar arias said his government had 
confirmed the incursion he condemned it 
the leftist nicaraguan government took control of all privately 
owned radio stations wednesday and hooked them up into a national 
network that broadcast government announcements and revolutionary 
music 
ortega told a news conference wednesday afternoon that the 
offensive was launched march 6 and that sandinista troops recently 
disloged about 2000 rebels from northern jinotega province he did 
not say how many sandinista troops took part in that action 
ortega said the contras were receiving logistical support and 
evacuation from chinook helicopters owned by the united states 
referring to reports earlier wednesday that the reagan 
administration was considering sending military support to 
honduras ortega said this is the most serious threat in recent 
years we are calling on the nicaraguan public to be alert to be 
in combat readiness ready to repel resist defeat whatever 
aggression from the united states 
staterun voice of nicaragua radio said earlier there were 
reports from the atlantic coastal city of puerto cabezas 250 miles 
east of managua that unidentified airplanes were seen and that 
residents feared the city would be bombed 
it called on nicaraguans to maintain a state of alert 
because we cant discount the possibility that president reagan 
will invade nicaragua in defense of his mercenaries 
a defense ministry spokeswoman maj rosa pasos told reporters 
earlier we have never invaded honduras and we have never invaded 
any neighboring country 
lopez contreras said the honduran president telephoned the 
presidents of costa rica el salvador and guatemala to ask them to 
urge ortega to withdraw his troops from the border 
speaking of the offensive against the contras ortega said 
they have been totally expelled from nicaraguan territory and are 
located in honduran territory opening fire against our positions 
in nicaragua 
the leftist president said that 400 contras had been killed or 
wounded in the operation thirtyfour sandinista soldiers had died 
and 68 were wounded he said 
ortega charged that the united states was creating this 
scandal to delay talks between the sandinistas and contras on a 
ceasefire in the 6yearold war the meeting which would be the 
first on nicaraguan territory is scheduled next monday 
the president said he called on the united nations and the 
organization of american states to investigate the offensive and to 
prove that the contra bases were located in honduras 
honduras and other central americans are prohibited from 
offering financial or logistical help to rebels under a regional 
peace plan signed august 7 
in march 1986 1500 sandinista troops reportedly penetrated 
honduran territory us helicopters ferried honduran troops to the 
border and provided honduras 20 million in emergency aid 
ortega never directly admitted the incursion but said at the 
time we attack where they say they have their bases 
until last year the contras maintained support bases in 
honduras fueled by 100 million in us aid most of the more than 
6000 rebels moved their camps into nicaraguan territory 
in december 1986 honduran warplanes and artillery pounded 
sandinista troops who had penetrated into honduras to attack contra 
bases and us army helicopters again were brought in to ferry 
honduran infantrymen to the front

a week and a half after his breakthrough in the 
south democrat albert gore jr is in need of another one in a 
state where a win will sustain his claim to be a real contender 
but gores campaign still is trying to find that state 
he never expected it would be illinois although gores 
presidential campaign poured an estimated 200000 to 300000 into 
late television ads there in hopes of a surprisingly strong showing 
and its not likely to be the next big state either michigans 
democratic caucuses march 26 will determine a big chunk of 
delegates 138 but the process here requires organization a 
commodity gores campaign is short on 
i think hes got to win some states but im not saying which 
one right now said larry harrington gores deputy campaign 
manager and political director 
gore rocketed to the top tier of democratic presidential 
contenders on super tuesday by doing what he said he would do 
carry a good chunk of the south 
he claimed five southern states gore took a split decision in 
wyoming three days days earlier which he points to as a win that 
with his victory in nevadas caucuses proves drawing power outside 
the south 
but no one will ride to the nomination on the strength of those 
two small western states while gore contends he has already 
established himself as the moderate with national appeal the rest 
of the democratic party is awaiting proof in the series of northern 
and midwestern states that stretch from now until the california 
primary june 7 
still serving as a principal strategist for his own campaign 
gore is studying the primary calender 
the gore campaign plans to set up some organization in virtually 
all the remaining primary states supporting his claim to be more 
than a regional candidate 
they dont want to single out any state as holding the best 
potential for gore to avoid being drawn into a makeorbreak 
contest 
yet gore must establish a northern beachhead somewhere if he is 
to continue to argue that he is the most electable candidate and 
only real alternative to jesse jackson and michael dukakis and 
more importantly if he is to keep up in delegates 
he must single out some state or states to focus his budget for 
television commercials 
thats the real decision said harrington 
a state to punch through gore called it 
weve got a whole series of contests between now and june 7 
gore said talking aboard his campaign plane this week were 
going to compete in all of them and in some were going to punch 
through 
were pushing everywhere and looking for the best 
opportunity to make an allout push to break through and i think 
there are a lot of opportunities gore said 
a look at the primary calender reveals no easy choice however 
none of the upcoming states offers the comfort of a natural base 
he named nearly all the big ones as posing opportunity 
connecticut ohio pennsylvania new york indiana wisconsin 
california and new jersey 
he called connecticut an opportunity to demonstrate real 
strength but at the same time a dukakis backyard 
the campaign also considers new york as having potential and 
wisconsin is another candidate 
as it wrestles with the decision gores campaign is 
experiencing the growing pains associated with the new demands of a 
national effort 
it is struggling to add depth this week it hired departed 
candidate bruce babbitts issues director bart gellman to help 
craft policy positions it has also put harrington and press aide 
mike kopp with the candidate to beef up gores traveling staff 
gore also says fundraising has been spurred by super tuesday 
and he took in as much as 150000 a day immediately after that 
showing 
even so the campaign is hardly a match for the wellheeled 
dukakis organization gores schedule is being made up practically 
on the fly 
gore sought endorsements from democratic figures in southern 
states and he has turned to state legislators in states like 
michigan and connecticut 
but harrington called michigan a particularly tough state for 
gore because of the need for an organization that can deliver in 
the caucuses gore had virtually no organization there before this 
week and even now it is based primarily on the state house speaker 
and other legislative leaders 
fewer than half a dozen supporters turned out for gores arrival 
in detroit monday night and his campaign advance man had only been 
in the state a few hours before the candidate arrived 
were not going to blow the doors off there harrington said

us veterans are cheating the government out 
of tens of millions of dollars each year by lying about their 
incomes and collecting excessive benefits as a result a 
congressional report says 
the report by the general accounting office the investigative 
wing of congress compared veterans administration income forms 
filled out by pensioners with internal revenue service data 
sen frank murkowski ralaska released the report wednesday 
and said congress should move to halt the abuses by giving the va 
access to same tax information so it can verify what veterans tell 
it about income from jobs and investments murkowski is the senior 
republican on the veterans affairs committee 
the irs information is compiled from reports supplied by 
employers and other income sources such as banks and stockbrokers 
the gaos findings were based on an examination of such 
information from a single year it said pensioners who understated 
their incomes to the va potentially collected 1825 million more 
in pension payments than they deserved in 1984 
under the law the size of a va pension which went to 14 
million people in 1984 is determined principally by a recipients 
total income from all sources 
the gao report said congressional investigators found that 
549000 pensioners failed to tell the va about 947 million in 
income 
the report said that more than 26000 veterans told the va they 
had no earned income in 1984 but each actually made at least 1000 
through employment 
some cases had reported no earnings over several years 
although tax data showed significant earnings in those years gao 
said 
some 60 percent of the pensioners who understated their incomes 
to the va failed to report that they received money through 
interest and dividends according to gao 
the report said it could not estimate the exact amount of 
pension overpayments by the va but it estimated that potential 
overpayments of 1825 million went to 149000 pensioners whose va 
and irs records had a difference of 100 or more 
murkowski said the figures may be low because gao made several 
conservative decisions in compiling its data including ignoring 
all unreported income below 100 
murkowski and gao urged the va to overhaul its income 
verification system and said congress should give the agency the 
legal ability to use irs data to crosscheck the income veterans 
report to the va 
this is the type of system that has been used for several years 
to verify the income of applicants for and recipients of needbased 
entitlement programs such as aid to families with dependent 
children 
murkowski said that if va was allowed the same access to tax 
records as the gao had and as food stamps medicaid and other 
meanstested programs do va pension payments would be focused on 
the intended beneficiaries and more money would be available for 
other veterans programs and services 
the senator said he would introduce legislation to give the va 
the ability to use irs records to verify what it is told by its 
pensioners 
clearly va should be allowed to go to where the most accurate 
information can be found he said 
the intent of this legislation is not to get anyone he 
said rather it is to protect the integrity of this vital 
benefit and to ensure the money goes to its intended 
beneficiaries 
gao quoted the va as saying it agreed with the reports findings 
that it needs the tools to verify pensioners income and that its 
income questionnaires could be improved 
but it quoted the irs as saying it opposes giving the va access 
to tax data because such access would compromise the voluntary 
tax system

with no chance of winning the republican 
presidential nomination his campaign curtailed and his former 
free spending shackled pat robertson is trying to map out his role 
at the partys national convention and beyond 
the former television evangelist confidently says the party will 
listen to his conservative message but other political analysts 
believe robertson has squandered his strength with a string of poor 
primary showings 
all agree that his real effect on the party is likely to come in 
1990 and 1992 
robertson believes his active presence at the new orleans 
convention will ensure that the likely nominee vice president 
george bush will heed the conservative position on the issues 
i want to ask george bush questions is he going to be as 
fervent for the contras as ronald reagan will he be truthfully 
as fervent for tax cuts as ronald reagan robertson said tuesday 
after finishing third in the illinois primary behind bush and 
kansas sen bob dole 
robertson is claiming his forces will make themselves felt in 
the convention platform and rules committees he said he would like 
to see the 1984 platform resurrected it was a good 
conservative platform 
that platform endorsed constitutional amendments to ban abortion 
and to allow prayer in school and opposed the equal rights 
amendment and any tax increases 
robertson has spent nearly 25 million on a campaign that has 
won 17 delegates the federal spending cap for the primaries is 27 
million some longtime robertson watchers question the amount of 
clout that gives him 
he has no chance to win the nomination he never did his 
candidacy is irrelevant in terms of the nomination said larry 
sabato a professor of political science at the university of 
virginia and longtime observer of state and national politics 
though robertson may have some effect on the partys platform 
and procedural votes in the convention he lost a great deal of 
clout because of his pitiful performance in the south sabato 
said 
robertson won none of the 14 southern and border states holding 
primaries or caucuses on the march 8 super tuesday he placed third 
in his home state of virginia and was third in his hometown of 
virginia beach 
richard pinsky the national field director for americans for 
robertson said even though the candidate will not be contesting 
any of the primary states and will be taking his scaledback 
campaign only to states holding caucuses he expects robertson to 
come to the convention with 150 to 200 delegates 
he has a substantial bloc of votes behind him said william 
whitehurst a professor of history at old dominion university and 
former virginia 2nd district representative for 19 years what it 
boils down to is what does he want in the way of price to keep him 
in the party fold 
robertson met with republican national committee chairman frank 
fahrenkopf on tuesday to discuss what the candidate called 
housekeeping details surrounding the convention robertson 
would not say whether he asked the party for a chance to address 
the convention during prime time 
hopefully we could be in that kind of time slot said connie 
snapp robertsons director of communications but that was not 
discussed 
its difficult to predict what robertson might get said 
whitehurst his showing has been sufficiently weak that he cant 
make too many demands he said whitehurst said he does not see 
robertson being offered a cabinet post or a place on the ticket 
he needs to wait for friendlier times whitehurst said 
and acquire the political maturity he desperately needs 
sabato and merle black political scientist from the university 
of north carolina and another commentator on southern politics see 
robertsons longterm effect on the party coming at the state and 
local level 
in many caucus states robertsons people the majority of them 
political newcomers have taken control of the party at the 
precinct level 
although robertsons viability as a candidate seems to be 
dissipating i think well see the impact of his candidacy through 
these delegates partly at the convention partly in local and 
state politics as well this may be played out over years said 
black 
these new people are part of the party and are not fighting 
the party we are sending a signal at the convention that we are 
sticking with the party snapp said and that the party is 
going to need us

as terry andersons fourth year in captivity 
began his friends and loved ones gathered to pray for the 
longestheld american hostages release from lebanon 
pray that terry anderson will come back from hell said 
charles glass at a ceremony to honor the american newsman who has 
been kept blindfolded and chained to a wall during his captivity 
glass also a journalist escaped from captivity last year 
more than 300 people attended the ceremony for anderson among 
them jesse jackson the democratic presidential candidate peggy 
say andersons sister and the revs lawrence martin jenco and 
benjamin weir former hostages 
other ceremonies for anderson were held in batavia ny where 
mrs say lives and lorain ohio andersons birthplace 
by coincidence the third anniversary of andersons captivity 
came as former white house aides oliver l north and john 
poindexter were indicted for their role in selling weapons to iran 
and sending the profits to the nicaraguan contras 
jenco and weir are two of the three americans hostages released 
as a result of the weapons shipments to iran both have said they 
would have opposed selling arms to the radical government of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
anderson 40 and at least some of the other eight american 
hostages are thought to be held by proiranian groups in lebanon 
mrs say said that since the irancontra affair was revealed 
in november 1986 the reagan administration embarrassed by the 
episode has ignored the hostages for the past year silence 
she said 
jackson blasted the administration for taking a passive role and 
pursuing what he called a flawed policy in the middle east we 
must be willing to make it happen he said 
jackson said he would go to lebanon to talk with andersons 
captors if they would identify themselves 
sen daniel p moynihan dny said in a statement that he has 
proposed a special envoy to deal with the hostages 
i will not accept the explanation that nothing can be done 
he said something must be done 
the service at holy trinity roman catholic church included 
christian and moslem prayers songs a candlelighting ceremony and 
personal reminiscences about anderson children in the audience 
distributed olive leaves as a symbol of peace 
many in the group were colleagues of andersons in beirut where 
he served as the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press 
the ceremony was arranged by the journalists committee to free 
terry anderson a group dedicated to seeing him released and no 
greater love a humanitarian organization that helps families of 
hostages and victims of terrorism 
don mell an ap photographer recounted how anderson had the 
look of a man who knew he was doomed when he was kidnapped after 
a game of tennis in west beirut three years ago the whole thing 
took less than a minute said mell who witnessed the abduction 
the state department meantime reaffirmed administration policy 
toward the hostages 
we have made constant efforts to open a valid channel of 
communications to the terrorists department spokeswoman sondra 
mccarty said they have responded with unacceptable demands 
conveyed through oneway channels such as videotapes given to news 
agencies 
the united states is willing to talk but it will not make 
concessions she said

a 19th century irish farmer longs for more of 
the world than his familys farm but is reined in by his mothers 
apron strings in the great hunger presented by dublins abbey 
theater the national theater of ireland 
based on a poem of the same title by patrick kavanagh the play 
by tom macintyre develops as a series of episodes rather than 
narrative some of wednesdays secondnight audience in the triplex 
at manhattan community college apparently not enjoying theater of 
indirection left at intermission 
one is reminded of a beckett play actor tom hickey has the 
morethanscruffy clothes aged unshaven look and anguished 
expressions of a beckett protagonist theres also a lot of noises 
nonsense syllables and silence but theres more speech and a lot 
more lively moving around than is usual in beckett 
the farmer paddy maguire lacks education and money and the 
ability to escape from his small world in one articulate passage 
between paddy and his sister toward the end of the play they 
exchange phrases the young men and women i might have joined 
them i remember a night we walked through the moon the four of us 
seeking adventure 
the mother is represented on stage by a primitive wood carving 
seated her lap a chair there are seven in the cast who sometimes 
are children paddys pigs chickens or team of horses 
audience members who were interested seemed to be concentrating 
so hard they didnt relax to laugh one very funny few moments came 
when a girl selling raffle tickets for the catholic church joined 
paddy in a superior cluckandstrut roosterhen mating dance in his 
barnyard 
much of the time paddy sits on his gate or compensates for his 
lack of female companionship this may have sent some of the 
audience home 
director patrick mason joined the company in 1977 and has 
directed five tom macintyre works the current engagement through 
march 27 ends a tour of the soviet union and the united states 
the last time the abbey theater was in new york was in 1976 
when it presented the plough and the stars at the brooklyn 
academy of music its last manhattan appearance was on broadway in 
1937 with juno and the paycock and the playboy of the

shady organizations with officialsounding 
names are using fear over the future of social security to get the 
elderly to send them money according to sen john mccain rariz 
who denounced the practice as a sham 
the solicitations are little more than efforts to raise money 
for the organizations which prey on the fears of the aged mccain 
told a federal trade commission hearing on wednesday 
he called on the agency to investigate several organizations 
which he said consumer reports magazine has identified as using 
fraudulent fundraising techniques 
what all these mailings have in common is officialsounding 
names and letterhead implying a special connection with social 
security which simply does not exist mccain said in addition 
their messages imply that social security is in trouble which 
is simply not the case 
while there are worthwhile organizations for the elderly mccain 
said many of those sending out such solicitations do nothing more 
than raise funds for their own coffers and send postcards to 
congressional offices 
pure and simple this is a sham mccain said and its 
victims are those who can least afford to take money needed for 
their basic daytoday needs and send it to such organizations 
fraud against the elderly is a problem of increasing magnitude 
one that deserves our active attention mccain said at a 
special ftc hearing on the problems of the aged 
the number of people in the united states over the age of 65 
now exceeds the entire population of canada and americans 65 and 
older make the fastest growing population segment in this 
country observed ftc chairman daniel oliver in opening the 
session 
the census bureau estimated that there were about 29 million 
americans aged 65 and over as of 1986 while canada was estimated 
to have a total population of about 26 million 
the ftc which investigates fraud and antitrust matters called 
in a series of witnesses to discuss the problems of the elderly 
and what can be done to help 
testimony also focused on the socalled medigap insurance plans 
designed to supplement medicare and medicaid benefits for the 
elderly 
rep claude pepper dfla said sales fraud in that industry is 
costing the elderly as much as 3 billion annually 
commissioner terri calvani noted that the ftc is looking into 
sales practices in this industry which consumer groups say induce 
many elderly people to purchase duplicative and unneeded coverage 
however calvani noted that the commission is specifically 
prohibited from regulating the insurance industry so that 
regardless of what it finds in the investigation any action would 
have to come from congress or from the states 
telephone marketing fraud and medical quackery also are major 
problems for elderly americans the witnesses said

the federal communications commission is 
abandoning plans for a hefty increase in telephone hookup charges 
for computer users according to fcc and congressional sources 
strong and nearly unanimous opposition to the proposal led fcc 
chairman dennis r patrick to give up on it said the sources who 
spoke on the condition they not be identified by name 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis said wednesday that patrick 
had not spoken with her about scrapping the plan but she said she 
agrees 
theres a lot on our plate right now and i dont think id 
miss not seeing that on it she said 
their votes would be enough to ditch the proposal though the 
third commissioner james quello who could not be reached for 
comment was likely to concur 
patricks office declined to comment 
dropping the plan would be good news for the hundreds of 
thousands of computer users who dial into databases such as 
compuserve and quantumlink the services carry items such as news 
stories and financial reports and allow users to communicate 
electronically with each other 
users of these services flooded the fcc and capitol hill with 
thousands of letters opposing the plan which would add about 450 
an hour to the cost of hooking up to information services 
they said the increased charges which would double the hourly 
hookup price for some information services would drive many of 
them off the computer networks and crush a fledgling industry 
rep edward j markey dmass and chairman of the house energy 
and commerce telecommunications subcommittee said that in light of 
the commissions apparent reversal on the proposal he would delay 
indefinitely introduction of a bill preventing the fcc from 
imposing the access charges 
but he said the panel will closely monitor the commissions 
actions to ensure that these onerous charges do not reemerge in a 
new form 
the fcc had proposed extending to computer users the same access 
charges now paid by longdistance companies for access to the local 
phone network the longdistance companies pass these charges along 
to callers in their rates 
when it adopted the longdistance access charges in 1982 the 
fcc exempted information service providers fearing that the new 
industry would not withstand the sudden increase in costs 
in proposing to levy the charges last year the fcc said the 
issue was one of fairness 
but the commission found virtually no support for the proposal 
even the reagan administration which usually backs the fccs 
ideas opposed the idea 
the sources said patrick concluded the proposal should be 
dropped because of the lack of support and because the commission 
is considering plans by the local bell phone companies to give 
information providers equal access to their networks as they have 
given longdistance companies these plans could change the way 
information services are provided over the local networks 
the commission was expected to vote in two to three months to 
drop the proposal

the ashes of dorothy parker the writer poet 
critic and algonquin round table wit are going to a final resting 
place in baltimore after languishing for years on a shelf in a 
lawyers office 
as she suggested for her epitaph excuse my dust 
mrs parker whose fiction poetry criticism and ascerbic wit 
epitomized the sophistication of new york city in the 20s and 
30s was exiled to baltimore at an irreverent meeting of fans 
wednesday at the algonquin hotel 
best known for her immortal squib men seldom make passes at 
girls who wear glasses she wrote in 1956 that wit has truth in 
it wisecracking is simply calisthenics with words 
success came early to mrs parker who was drama critic for 
vanity fair magazine at age 24 and soon a regular at the 
algonquin trading barbs with robert benchley alexander woolcott 
george kaufman ring lardner and heywood broun 
she died bitter and alone in her hotel room in 1967 after a 
life whose early successes could not overcome the later 
disillusionment that included unhappy love affairs three marriages 
and four suicide attempts 
she wrote 
razors pain you 
rivers are damp 
acids stain you 
and drugs cause cramp 
guns arent lawful 
nooses give 
gas smells awful 
you might as well live 
for 10 years mrs parkers ashes have been sitting in a 
canister on a shelf in a wall street office they wound up there 
when playwright lillian hellman executor of mrs parkers estate 
refused to pay a mortuary bill and the mortuary threatened to throw 
them out 
they were rescued by miss hellmans attorney paul odwyer who 
decided last summer that hed like to get them out of his office 
new york daily news columnist liz smith said she wrote about the 
situation and readers replied with perhaps the most literate the 
most charming and the most intelligent mail thats been written in 
the past 50 years 
and that led to wednesdays meeting at the algonquin which mrs 
parker helped make famous as the home of the round table the 
weekly gathering of new yorks literati in the 1920s and 30s 
ms smith said that mrs parker would have been quite 
sarcastic about this whole thing and would have thought we were 
terrible fools 
some people ms smith among them thought the ashes should be 
interred at the algonquin bar where mrs parker created many a 
hangover but the algonquins current management wasnt 
enthusiastic about that idea 
odwyer dutifully offered the suggestion of one letter writer 
an artist who wanted to use mrs parkers ashes to thicken his oil 
paints but that got little more than a few snickers 
book collector bob weinberg of stamford conn said he went to 
the meeting hoping to take home the ashes to complete his 
collection of mrs parkers work but he apparently thought better 
of the idea and never proposed it 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people said mrs parker had left 
her entire estate to the naacp when that was quite a daring 
thing for a white woman to do 
he offered a place for the ashes at naacp national headquarters 
in baltimore conceding that some people might not want the naacp 
to have the ashes not because were not worthy but because 
were not in new york 
some people agreed but others thought mrs parker would 
appreciate hooks gesture when the algonquins manager sweetened 
the deal by offering to hold a benefit dinner to create a dorothy 
parker scholarship fund that sealed it 
mrs parker might have appreciated the irony of a quintessential 
new yorkers banishment to baltimore as she wrote in the 20s 
why is it no one ever sent me yet 
one perfect limousine do you suppose 
ah no its always just my luck to get 
one perfect rose

an energy department official has asked a 
house appropriations subcommittee to authorize 18 billion in 
advance for the final three years of a cleancoal technology 
program 
we have no desire to make any frivolous expenditures 
assistant energy secretary j allen wampler told a house panel on 
wednesday we monitor that real closely 
wampler asked the subcommittee to authorize the expenditure in 
the fiscal years 1990 1991 and 1992 the money pays up to half the 
cost of projects to show the ways cleancoal technology can be used 
by power plants and industry 
seven projects were given 227 million in the first phase of the 
program and wampler said four contracts still being negotiated 
will bring the initial commitment to 400 million 
in addition he said the energy department will award 575 
million this year for secondphase projects using money 
appropriated for fiscal 1988 and 1989 the interest is out 
there wampler said 
president reagan proposed a fiveyear 5 billion cleancoal 
program in an effort to curb acid rain which occurs when sulfur 
dioxide and other emissions from power plants and factory boilers 
mix with moisture aloft and fall to the ground as rain 
acid rain is blamed for aquatic pollution and damage to crops 
and forests in the northeast and canada 
although the white house requested 850 million for cleancoal 
projects in fiscal 1988 and 1989 congress approved only the 575 
million wampler said the department is asking congress to restore 
money cut from the program in addition to authorizing the 
appropriations for the three years 
while wampler was seeking more money for the future a group 
representing states and private participants in the program was 
meeting in the nations capital to learn how members could qualify 
for the 575 million setaside for secondphase projects 
at its third annual conference the clean coal technology 
coalition also endorsed the energy department budget request 
if the program is successful the environment will benefit 
our national energy security will be strengthened the use of us 
coal resources will be assured and consumers electric or energy 
bills will be kept to a minimum said ben yamagata its executive 
director the benefits are really enormous

president reagans armsforhostages deals 
became the springboard for an elaborate illegal conspiracy to aid 
the nicaraguan contras and enrich two private businessmen 
according to the indictment of four key irancontra figures 
it is this conspiracy that forms the backbone of the 23count 
indictment against former national security adviser john m 
poindexter his aide oliver l north and the two businessmen 
retired air force maj gen richard secord and his business 
partner albert hakim 
arms sales to iran were formally authorized by reagan on jan 
17 1986 when he signed an official finding 
but the indictment charged that the defendants ranged far beyond 
the presidents initiative into the zone of illegality 
they did it by deceiving the justice department congress and 
even the central intelligence agency the indictment said official 
documents were destroyed and transactions were concealed through 
use of foreign corporations and untraceable swiss bank accounts 
the grand jurors said 
the aid to the contras came while such assistance was banned by 
congress 
the indictment accused the defendants of repeating the same 
deceptive scheme to make a profit for what secord and hakim called 
the enterprise and to arm and supply the contras 
for instance in early 1986 the indictment said the defendants 
told the cia that iran paid 37 million for 1000 tow antitank 
missiles when the iranians actually paid 10 million 
the difference went for the contras and to swiss investment 
accounts under the control of the defendants secord and hakim for 
their personal benefit the indictment said 
in may 1986 the indictment went on 164 million was deposited 
for the enterprise including 15 million from iran for hawk 
antiaircraft missile parts and tows for israel the tows for 
israel were to replenish that nations supply for its prior 
transfer of tows to iran 
the conspirators caused only 65 million to be transmitted to 
the united states through the cia thus leaving a remainder of 
almost 10 million in the bank accounts of the enterprise the 
indictment said the arms sales profits again went for the contras 
and the hakimsecord profits 
and in october and november 1986 the conspirators shipped 500 
tows to iran and were paid 36 million by the iranians only 
slightly more than 2 million went to the us government through 
the cia with the remaining 15 million going to the businessmen 
the indictment said 
part of the conspiracy involved norths fundraising for the 
contras and the secordhakim enterprise 
in the spring and early summer of 1985 in order to fund the 
enterprise the defendant oliver l north began raising money 
through the national endowment for the preservation of liberty by 
among other things arranging meetings with officers of and 
potential contributors to nepl and others participating in 
soliciting contributions for the contras the indictment said 
from the fall of 1985 to december 1986 the defendant oliver 
l north controlled the disposition of funds raised for the contras 
through nepl 
last spring two conservative fundraisers carl r spitz 
channell and richard miller pleaded guilty to felony charges that 
they conspired with north to illegally use a taxexempt foundation 
for the purpose of raising money for the contras a nonexempt 
purpose both are cooperating with walshs investigation 
and in june 1986 the indictment said north came up with a new 
scheme he attempted to divert to the enterprise a 10 million 
contribution from brunei intended for humanitarian aid to the 
contras 
he did so by undertaking to supply an official of the 
department of state elliott abrams with the bank account number 
of lake resources an enterprise account instead of the number of 
a contra bank account which the official had requested 
another part of the conspiracy was to deceive congress the 
indictment said north and poindexter made false fictitious 
fraudulent and misleading statements and representations 
concerning among other things the involvement of officials of the 
united states in support of the military and paramilitary 
operations in nicaragua such assistance was banned by the boland 
amendment passed by congress 
and in november 1986 as a justice department inquiry of the 
contra effort closed in on north and poindexter they altered 
destroyed removed official and other documents and records 
including classified documents and records of the nsc and the staff 
of the nsc the indictment said 
it said north further tried to cover up his activities in late 
november 1986 by making false and misleading statements to the 
attorney general who was conducting an inquiry for the president

as a protestant gunman opened fire and 
hurled grenades at a roman catholic funeral another protestant was 
receiving a medal from a different group of catholics for his 
fortitude in a different atrocity 
while three people lay dying in the milltown cemetery in belfast 
on wednesday gordon wilson of northern ireland was in limerick in 
the irish republic being honored for his words of love and 
forgiveness after losing his daughter in an ira bombing that killed 
11 protestants 
thus as often happens in the 19year cycle of violence savaging 
northern ireland two dreadful deeds four months apart came 
together in a mixture of horror and poignancy 
after the nov 8 bombing in enniskillen some optimists hoped 
56yearold wilsons courageous example would ignite a grassroots 
rebellion against violence of all political stripes 
cynics however talked of the politics of the last atrocity 
the notion that no single bloodbath can turn hearts and minds to 
peace because sooner or later the other side will try to square 
the books with a similar atrocity 
wednesdays attack is a severe setback to northern irelands 
british rulers who believed they were on the way to shoving the 
irish republican army out of the catholic mainstream 
that was the purpose of the 1985 angloirish agreement which 
gave the irish government a say in the running of northern ireland 
on the assumption that catholics would come to see dublin rather 
than the ira as their protector 
the funeral bloodbath is bound to help the ira which is 
fighting to drive the british from protestantdominated northern 
ireland and recoup the loss of face it suffered over the 
enniskillen bombing 
wednesdays atrocity also showed just how thin a tightrope 
northern ireland can be 
the three people being buried were ira guerrillas shot and 
killed in gibraltar march 6 as they allegedly prepared to plant a 
car bomb and the fact that they died unarmed had already scored 
propaganda points for the ira against britain 
had the belfast police turned out in force as they usually do at 
ira funerals the unmasked gunman might never have mounted such a 
blatant attack 
but the police reluctant to get into a fight with the mourners 
that might hand the ira yet more sympathy stayed well away and 
none was around to disarm the attacker 
meanwhile gibraltar put the irish government in a vice as well 
on the one hand dublin was condemning the british for slaying 
unarmed irish people but then it too regards the ira as a mortal 
enemy 
so while wringing its hands over the deaths dublin made sure 
the guerrillas cortege was shunted out of irish territory with 
minimal fanfare and a state radio journalist was suspended for 
airing interviews with leaders of sinn fein the legal political 
wing of the outlawed ira as the hearses drove north to belfast 
ireland feels it has enough problems of unemployment 
emigration crime and high taxes without having to deal with a 
crisis it regards as being of britains making 
the funeral shootings came on the eve of st patricks day when 
dublin was preparing an extra big parade to commemorate its 
millennium the deaths had no visible impact on the shoppers 
cramming central dublin 
but trouble was clearly brewing from the moment the gibraltar 
coffins crossed the border into northern ireland 
ulster protestants have grown increasingly frustrated at their 
failure to topple the angloirish agreement which they see as an 
intolerable intrusion in affairs by a hostile catholic state 
dublins protests about the gibraltar killings were to 
protestants an outrageous abuse of its rights of intervention 
under the angloirish accord considering that a car bombing was 
allgedly being planned 
as soon as the cortege entered northern ireland on monday night 
it was jeered and stoned by protestants thus the prospect of a 
protestant gunman opening fire on the funeral was not as 
farfetched as might be imagined 
the incidents come at a troubled time for angloirish relations 
after the honeymoon engendered by the 1985 pact 
a series of rancorous incidents have occurred over british 
behavior in ulsterrelated matters in which the gibraltar 
shootings were only the latest irritant 
however at least one man remained optimistic gordon wilson 
told his audience in limerick 
i believe in the fundamental decency of all irish people and 
the longing for peace in all irish hearts i have no doubt about 
that

democratic presidential contenders are expressing concern about 
president reagans decision to send us troops to honduras today 
with jesse jackson calling it heavyhanded while indictments 
in the irancontra affair are putting some political heat on george 
bush 
bob doles backers were quick to suggest that if bush is the 
republican nominee the democrats will use the reignited 
irancontra affair as ammunition against him this fall 
the democrats didnt wait that long however with richard 
gephardt calling the indictments evidence that the reagan 
administration has put the constitution through the shredder 
doles beleaguered gop campaign meanwhile came in for some 
serious scrutiny on wednesday with republican party chairman frank 
fahrenkopf hinting that the kansas senator should think about 
throwing in the towel after his latest loss to bush in illinois 
but dole whose aides said he would stay in the race at least 
until the wisconsin primary on april 5 got some encouragement from 
a dozen senate supporters who met to talk about his prospects 
i believe he should stay in said sen charles grassley of 
iowa one of the group grassley said the four indictments on 
wednesday in connection with the irancontra affair were not 
directly discussed but said theres going to be some reagan 
baggage that george bush has to contend with and realistically 
its going to be problems for the republicans this fall 
former national security adviser john poindexter lt col 
oliver l north retired maj gen richard v secord and secords 
business partner albert hakim were indicted on conspiracy charges 
stemming from the diversion of secret iran arms sale profits to 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
what is going on with those four gentlemen has nothing to do 
with this campaign said bush spokesman pete teeley 
but sen dave durenberger rminn said george cant duck 
the issue hes going to have to explain his role 
fahrenkopfs remarks however seemed aimed at suggesting that 
the senate minority leader should abandon his bid while stressing 
his neutrality in the gop campaign the party chief said he had a 
responsibility to ask bushs rivals for some reflection 
dole and former television evangelist pat robertson he said 
should start thinking past the convention and start thinking 
about november and the general election robertson has indicated 
he will drastically scale back his campaign but remain in the race 
meanwhile the democrats who have been eyeing each other warily 
amid prospects of a deadlocked race turned their fire on the 
reagan administration over both the irancontra indictments and the 
sending of four military battalions to honduras in response to a 
reported nicaraguan incursion there 
sending in our troops is a bit heavyhanded said jackson 
its just not necessary 
sen paul simon also expressed concern saying there is 
skepticism on the part of all of us about anything the 
administration does in central america 
simon also hit the administration over the irancontra affair 
saying the indictments underscore something fundamental that 
the administration cannot be trusted to obey the law 
we need a government we can trust he said 
that view was echoed by democratic rival gephardt 
whatever the outcome of these prosecutions i think the 
special prosecutor has given us fresh evidence that the reagan 
administration generally has put the constitution of the united 
states through the shredder gephardt said 
gephardt and simon both campaigned wednesday in michigan which 
holds its democratic caucuses march 26 gephardt running dead last 
in democratic delegate totals desperately needs a strong showing 
in the state 
they say im the underdog he said at a stop in lansing i 
like being the underdog because the underdog usually does well 
the missouri congressman will soon have to decide whether to 
continue his presidential campaign or file for reelection to his 
house seat the filing deadline is march 29 three days after the 
michigan contest 
tennessee sen albert gore jr still seeking a strong showing 
outside the south was campaigning today in kansas which holds 
local party caucuses on saturday gore was addressing the kansas 
house 
simon who revived his campaign with a homestate victory in 
illinois on tuesday continued to predict that no one will be able 
to patch together enough delegates for a firstballot victory at 
the national convention he said he doubted hed win in michigan 
but added id like to pick up as many delegates as i can 
dukakis again expressed hopes that the democratic contest 
wouldnt come down to a fight at the convention i think there is 
agreement on the part of most democrats across the country that 
somebody will come out of this primary process with if not an 
absolute majority a substantial plurality and that people will 
rally behind that person he said in boston 
obviously i hope i will be that person 
dukakis remained the democratic delegate leader even after being 
shut out of the delegate race in illinois the latest ap delegate 
count gave him 4645 jackson 46055 gore 3548 simon 1715 and 
gephardt 145 with 2082 needed to nominate 
dukakis also continued to lead the democratic field in federal 
matching funds the federal election commission on wednesday 
certified dukakis for another 600000 in matching funds bringing 
his total to nearly 57 million

tenyearold melissa montgomery 
transformed a class report on mississippi into an adventure that 
included a firsthand look at civil war battlefields a catfish 
fry grits mud pie and lots of museums 
the best part melissa said wednesday after returning from her 
fiveday excursion into the deep south was the impressionist 
gallery and its neat stuff 
the worst she said was the catfish which she had to taste at 
what californians would have called a barbecue but in the deep 
south is known as a fishfry 
not far behind the ugly creatures came a planetarium 
you just look up its dumb she said 
it all started when the fifthgrader from john swett elementary 
school showed her mother a rough draft of a report on mississippi 
melissa compiled it with the help of an encyclopedia a couple of 
weeks ago 
her mother cringed at such stuffy phrases as institute of 
higher learning and decided there had to be a better way to 
inspire her daughter 
she called a visitors bureau in mississippi for a few 
postcards then asked the secretary of states office for a book 
outlining interesting and important facts about the state but they 
were all out 
when someone suggested yall ought to come out and see 
mississippi for yourself melissas mother kathryn told them to 
make some arrangement three days later melissa was bound for the 
magnolia state she stayed with a fred and maridel ingram parents 
of a fifthgrader at casey elementary in the capital of jackson 
on the trip financed in part by an anonymous donor melissa 
visited such sites as the mississippi river the state museum of 
natural science and also got to meet gov ray mabus 
he just kind of shook my hand she said he was nice 
the excursion included a few too many museums for such an active 
california girl who would have preferred riding horses swimming 
or iceskating instead it was more of an educational and cultural 
trip she said 
she was startled when mississippi folks laughed at a west coast 
speech pattern she didnt know she had 
i said you guys they said yall they think i have an 
accent said melissa sprawled on the couch back home amid 
welcome home balloons and streamers 
during her visit melissa was dogged by reporters and camera 
crews i liked it at first but after a while i got sick of it 
upon her return she confided to her mother even madonna hates 
it 
she returned home laden with memories and trinkets such as a 
bale of cotton tshirts pens and brochures reflecting aspects of 
mississippi life 
when they talk about southern hospitality theyre not 
kidding said her mother 
the only things thats different said melissa is their 
attitude theyre really nice 
she had so much fun she has invited two of her new friends in 
mississippi to visit her in may 
but first comes the hard part melissas 50page report complete 
with pictures maps and a replica of the state flag is due 
wednesday 
shes got 36 pages done but already is planning her next report

susan butcher left the competition behind on 
the icy bering sea coast and mushed through bonechilling winds 
wednesday to claim her third straight victory in the 1150mile 
iditarod trail sled dog race 
butcher 33 collected a 30000 first prize by urging her 
ninedog team into the finish chute at 842 pm hours ahead of 
her closest rival in the 16th annual anchoragetonome trek she 
had been on the trail for more than 11 days 
im just amazed at what my dogs are doing and what theyve 
done all year said butcher 
butcher said she would try next year for a fourth straight win 
i very much want four i guess i want five she said 
hundreds of cheering fans braved the blustery 15degree weather 
to watch as butcher became the first musher to win three 
consecutive iditarods butcher started the race with 17 dogs but 
dropped eight at checkpoints along the trail 
im really happy said butchers husband dave monson who 
earlier this month won another longdistance alaska sled dog race 
the 1000mile yukon quest the couple run a kennel in the interior 
alaska village of manley 
weve had a tremendous year monson said it shows that 
hard work pays off sometimes 
butchers closest competitor martin buser of big lake was 
trailing by at least 14 hours wednesday butchers longtime rival 
fourtime iditarod champion rick swenson of two rivers was minutes 
behind buser for third place 
joe garnie of teller was running fourth and 70yearold joe 
redington of knik who organized the first iditarod in 1973 but has 
never won the race was fifth 
butcher had slept little since monday when she reached the 
bering sea coast in unalakleet 229 miles from nome she said a 
training run last month along the windy coast accustomed her team 
to the punishing conditions 
tuesday night butcher guided her team through subzero 
temperatures and winds that brought the wind chill factor down to 
minus 70 degrees peeking out from a furruffed parka butcher 
suffered only a frostnipped wrist 
the wind was going right into my big mitt and up my arm its 
still pretty sore she said earlier wednesday 
one of butchers lead dogs this year was granite a husky that 
led her to victory last year 
butcher competing in her 11th iditarod long dreamed of being 
the first woman musher to win but that honor went to libby riddles 
of teller in 1985 butcher won in 1986 and 1987 setting course 
records each time 
last year when the race followed its shorter southern route 
butcher finished in 11 days 2 hours 
the iditarod named after an old supply route to the gold mining 
districts of interior alaska draws its inspiration from a 1925 
relay of diphtheria serum to nome which was hit hard by an 
outbreak of the disease 
the race started march 5 on truckedin snow the temperature in 
downtown anchorage hovered around 32 degrees and climbed even 
higher during the next few days which strained the coldloving 
huskies 
fresh snow slowed the leaders as they climbed into the alaska 
range that gave an advantage to redington who had taken his 
mandatory 24hour layover early in the race and sailed past the 
leaders on the trail they had packed down 
redington known as the father of the iditarod has entered all 
but two of the races 16 runnings and has placed as high as fifth 
for 400 miles it seemed as if he might finally win but he lost 
the lead to buser on the yukon river 
butcher quickly caught up passing buser on tuesday near koyuk 
171 miles from the finish 
five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out

about 3200 american infantry and airborne 
troops are flying to honduras today in the most dramatic show of 
us force in the sixyear nicaraguan war causing the senates top 
democrat to accuse president reagan of overreaction 
the white house described the movement as an emergency 
deployment readiness exercise triggered by what it called the 
invasion of honduras by 1500 to 2000 nicaraguan forces pursuing 
contra rebels 
the exercise involves two battalions of the 82nd airborne 
division from fort bragg nc and two battalions from the 7th 
infantry division at fort ord calif 
the troops will be posted out of harms way for an indefinite 
period near the palmerola air force base in honduras about 125 
miles from the area of reported hostilities said marlin fitzwater 
the presidents spokesman 
this exercise is a measured response designed to show our 
staunch support to the democratic government of honduras at a time 
when its territorial integrity is being violated by the cuban and 
sovietsupported sandinista army fitzwater said in a latenight 
announcement 
he said it also was a signal to the governments and peoples of 
central america of the seriousness with which the united states 
government views the current situation in the region 
some congressional democrats werent buying the administrations 
rationale 
its an overreaction said senate majority leader robert 
byrd dwva the sandinistas have crossed over the border before 
and gone back 
i just hope its merited sen john kerry dmass said 
recalling a similar incident two years ago when the united states 
jumped to the aid of honduras under circumstances many saw as 
exaggerated by the white house then as now the development came 
as the administration was pushing a reluctant congress to approve 
military aid to the contras 
rep edward j markey dmass said this is not the first 
time the president has made use of his military authority after he 
lost a vote on the contras president reagans decision to send the 
82nd airborne to honduras has more to do with politics than with 
american security it is an irresponsible involvement of american 
troops in the conflict in central america and an unwise escalation 
of tensions in that region 
however a number of republicans were supportive 
house minority leader robert michel rill said the deployment 
was intended psychologically to give an indication that we are 
not just going to stand by and have nicaragua make incursions 
into neighboring countries 
rep jack fields rtexas said i dont think the president 
really had an alternative 
congressional leaders were briefed by telephone late wednesday 
elliott abrams assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs said congress would receive information today documenting 
the nicaraguan incursion 
we will present evidence which proves conclusively that 
there was a very large sandinista incursion into honduras that 
will show i think what to make of president ortegas claim that 
there isnt one single nicaraguan soldier in honduras its a 
lie abrams said on abcs nightline 
fitzwater said upwards of 2000 sandinistas are in honduras 
they are there and we have seen no evidence that they are 
retreating to their own country 
the developments came as secretary of state george p shultz and 
white house officials conferred with congressional leaders about 
the possibility of a new aid package for the contra rebels trying 
to topple nicaraguas leftist regime 
us aid to the rebels ran out two weeks ago and the 
administration is hoping the new situation will earn the contras 
greater sympathy in congress 
nicaraguan defense ministry officials denied wednesday there was 
any border crossing but later president daniel ortega appeared to 
leave open that possibility 
in a radio address he said sandinista forces had pushed back 
the contras into honduras and that there was crossfire from 
honduran territory against our forces his remarks did not 
confirm or deny the administration claims 
fitzwater said the us deployment came in response to a request 
from honduran president jose azcona he said reagan was briefed on 
the request about 8 pm est in his residence and decided to send 
in us forces 
as the president said when he was briefed on this issue when 
friends ask for our support we should provide it fitzwater 
said 
some 12500 american military personnel are stationed in central 
america including roughly 10000 who are located in panama total 
us military manpower in honduras varies from week to week 
depending upon the exercises being conducted

rep joseph p kennedy ii and leading civil 
rights activists say british troops are acting like latin american 
death squads where northern ireland is concerned 
the british today under the rule of mrs prime minister 
margaret thatcher are advocating just the kind of death squads 
the congress of the united states condemns every day the 
massachusetts democrat said outside the british embassy on the eve 
of st patricks day 
kennedy the greatgreatgrandson of irish immigrants was 
joined by martin luther king iii cesar chavez the rev joseph 
lowery rep john lewis dga and rep albert bustamante 
dtexas for a 50minute meeting with british ambassador antony 
acland 
the longscheduled embassy meeting came just hours after 
attackers lobbed grenades and fired shots into a heavily attended 
funeral in belfast for three slain irish republican army 
guerrillas the trio unarmed were shot march 6 by british troops 
in gilbraltar 
british authorities say the three ira members were on a bombing 
mission the outlawed ira is fighting to push the british out of 
protestantdominated northern ireland which remains part of the 
united kingdom 
kennedy and the other activists condemned the violence of the 
catholic ira and rival protestant paramilitary units but they 
blamed the british government for providing enthusiastic 
support to the british security forces and for not prosecuting 
soldiers 
killers and perjurers should be brought to justice and the 
world should know the truth the group wrote in a letter to mrs 
thatcher delivered to the ambassador 
after the closed meeting kennedy said aclands comments 
exemplified the callousness the british show toward the irish 
what we see today in northern ireland is complete abandonment 
by the british government of real justice issues kennedy told 
reporters outside the embassy compound theyre not fundamentally 
committed to change in northern ireland 
the embassy said only that it was a frank discussion on both 
sides 
but an embassy official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity derided the death squad analogy 
we regard that frankly as over the top the official said 
death squads imply shooting at will british troops the 
official said have strict orders to fire only if their lives or 
others are in danger 
kennedy urged britain to impose new laws to protect catholics 
against the type of discrimination that has resulted in up to 80 
percent unemployment among catholic men in some parts of northern 
ireland 
unless you get people employed in that country youre not 
going to see the cycle of violence change said kennedy a 
freshman congressman and the eldest son of the late sen robert f 
kennedy 
the fact is folks what we still face today in northern 
ireland is discrimination discrimination just as bad as we faced 
in the 1960s and earlier in our country he said 
kennedy lambasted new british proposals for fair employment 
legislation as empty rhetoric that lack timetables demanding 
tangible improvement 
king the son of the late rev martin luther king jr and 
lowery president of the southern christian leadership conference 
said the arguments the ambassador gave against affirmative action 
programs were the same ones voiced by opponents of the us civil 
rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s 
king who said his father would have been at the embassy 
wednesday to protest britains actions if he were alive said 
discrimination in all its forms is wrong whether its in a 
public place or a private boardroom in the united states in south 
africa or in ireland 
quoting his slain father king said injustice which is 
allowed to flourish anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

consumer advocates and industry are squaring 
off over the question of whether unstable allterrain vehicles 
should be recalled with even the federal consumer product safety 
commission split on the issue 
legislation being considered in congress would force makers of 
the offroad machines to buy back threewheeled versions the 
machines have been involved in more than 900 deaths and 300000 
injuries in the last five years 
the recall measure would go beyond the settlement reached monday 
between industry the justice department and cpsc 
that consent agreement yet to be approved by a federal judge 
calls for a ban on sales of the threewheeled vehicles provides 
for advertising stressing the dangers of atvs and institutes 
tougher safety programs and warnings for buyers of the new more 
stable fourwheeled atvs 
but it lacks provisions for a recall of the estimated 15 
million to 2 million threewheeled atvs already in use an omission 
that consumer advocates say could spell tragedy 
the consent decree isnt good enough rep james j 
florio dnj said wednesday at a hearing of the house energy and 
commerce consumer protection subcommittee which he chairs it 
fails to provide any real protection for those who bought the 
admittedly dangerous threewheelers in the past 
the legislation before us by requiring manufacturers to offer 
refunds to past purchasers of threewheel atvs provides this 
necessary relief 
susan a weiss of the consumer federation of america told the 
subcommittee that the settlement announced monday is simply 
inadequate to stem this devastation 
anne graham the lone cpsc member to oppose the settlement said 
she voted against it because it lacked a recall program 
if threewheeled atvs are hazardous enough to stop their sale 
then certainly the millions of consumers who already own them 
should be given the opportunity to return them graham said in 
her testimony 
commission chairman terrence m scanlon argued that if congress 
were to countermand the negotiated agreement other industries 
might be discouraged from negotiating with the cpsc to obtain 
remedies for consumers 
carol dawson the third member of the safety commission told 
the subcommittee those who bought atvs because they believed atv 
marketing that these machines were safe and fun for the entire 
family ought to have the right to a reasonable refund if they so 
choose 
wj michael cody tennessees attorney general also presented 
testimony supporting the refund legislation 
consumers who have already purchased an atv had no notice or 
inadequate notice of the risk of death and severe injury posed by 
atvs cody said manufacturers have affirmatively 
misrepresented the characteristics of atvs 
however lloyd cutler representing american honda motor co 
testified in favor of the settlement reached by the safety 
commission 
legislation overriding that agreement and requiring refunds 
would be unwise unconstitutional and unprecedented cutler 
told the subcommittee 
cutler questioned who would enter into settlements with 
government agencies if congress could reverse those agreements

moves by congress to raise the federal minimum 
wage this year will put presidential candidates on the spot and 
force them to take a position on the issue the chairman of the 
house labor committee says 
they like to say they are for a good education or a living 
wage for everyone said rep augustus f hawkins they will 
have to discuss in detail the numbers that congress sets they 
wont be able to just say they are for a living wage 
the house labor and education committee on wednesday ignored the 
threat of a presidential veto and approved legislation to raise the 
minimum wage from 335 per hour to 505 over the next four years 
the measure which passed after numerous republican attempts to 
weaken or gut it now goes to the full house 
this will be one of the great election issues hawkins 
dcalif said in an interview each candidate will be pinned 
down 
the democraticcontrolled committee approved the measure by 
voice vote after rejecting a republican proposal to permit a 
special new hire wage of 335 an hour 
hawkins said he expected the full house to take up the 
legislation within 10 days after members return april 11 from their 
easter recess 
the senate labor and human resources committee will take up a 
similar bill during the week of april 11 according to its 
chairman sen edward kennedy dmass 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin says senior white house advisers 
will urge president reagan to veto any minimum wage increase that 
would lead to a decrease in the number of job opportunities 
the initial house bill would have raised the minimum to 465 an 
hour over three years that figure is still contained in the senate 
bill the administration claims the proposal would result in 
elimination of 880000 jobs because employers wont be willing to 
pay their workers that much 
under the house committeepassed bill the minimum wage would go 
to 385 an hour next year 425 in 1990 465 in 1991 and 505 
in 1992 
last week the committee added the fourthyear increase of 40 
cents as a substitute for indexing or tying future raises 
to inflation 
indexing was supported by hawkins kennedy and organized labor 
but democrats dropped the plan because they feared it would result 
in little or no increase this year 
the final version of the bill was sent to the house floor after 
the committee defeated 2013 a proposal by rep steve bartlett 
rtexas to create a new hire or training wage by which 
employers could pay new workers 335 an hour for 90 days 
bartlett said the white house told him the president would veto 
any legislation not containing a lower starting wage 
rep matthew g martinez dcalif called the training wage 
proposal a sham a joke and a fraud he said it was nothing 
more than a way to get around the minimum wage 
the committee also rejected another bartlett amendment which 
would have given private employers the right to grant compensatory 
time off in lieu of wages for overtime 
also defeated by a voice vote was an amendment by rep thomas e 
petri rwis to permit employers to include the cost of fringe 
benefits such as health insurance in the calculation of the 
minimum wage and an amendment by rep william f goodling rpa 
to exempt motorcycle dealers from paying overtime 
robert mcglotten legislative director of the aflcio said the 
committee recognized the need to bring this nations working poor 
to at least the poverty level by gradually raising the minimum 
wage

corn is the most plentiful farm crop grown in 
the united states but is losing ground among brewers 
the agriculture department says only 345 million bushels of 
corn were used to make beer in 1987 the smallest amount in 25 
years just a decade ago american brewers used 536 million 
bushels of corn 
rice production has increased and lots of the lower grades go 
into breweries said larry van meir of the departments economic 
research service 
in 1961 he told the associated press breweries used about 34 
million hundredweight of rice by last year more than 15 million 
hundredweight were used to make beer 
corn is still ahead of rice in the brewers art however the 
345 million bushels at 56 pounds per bushel converts to about 
193 million hundredweight compared with the 15 million 
hundredweight of rice 
moreover corn used to make beer is only a small part of the 
huge supply the brewery figures were based on corn produced and 
used in the 198687 crop marketing year which included the bumper 
1986 corn harvest of 825 billion bushels 
of that amount more than 47 billion bushels were fed to 
livestock 15 billion bushels were exported and less than 12 
billion bushels went into food seed and industrial uses which 
includes corn flakes alcohol and beer 
van meirs agency says in a new report that the use of corn for 
food seed and industrial purposes called fsi by the economists 
is expected to continue growing at an annual rate of 3 percent to 4 
percent despite the decline in beer use 
since 1980 the largest single use of corn in the fsi category 
has been the manufacture of highfructose corn syrup abbreviated 
in the trade to hfcs of the 12 billion bushels that went into 
food seed and industrial uses in 198687 some 339 million bushels 
were used to make hfcs 
the rise of hfcs has been linked to a decline in the use of 
sugar in soft drinks and many other food products including baked 
goods dairy and cereal products 
corn also is a source of glucose and dextrose two other 
sweeteners and starch for a long list of industrial purposes in 
the paper and corrugating industries and by pharmaceutical 
building textile and food manufacturers 
department analysts estimate that about 300 million bushels of 
corn were used to make ethanol in 198687 the fuelgrade alcohol 
that is blended with gasoline 
use of corn for ethanol is expected to increase 3 percent to 5 
percent this year much slower than the doubledigit annual 
increases in 1979 through 1985 
monthly sales of ethanolblended fuel again reached new 
records during the first seven months of calendar 1987 the 
report said however as in 1986 sales fell off during late 
summer and the fall months 
the report explained one of the reasons for lower ethanol 
sales in the summer is the strong competition for wetmillion 
capacity heavy demand for hfcs in soft drinks in the summer along 
with the fact that hfcs cannot be stored for long periods of time 
means that any wetmilling capacity that has the ability to shift 
moves into higherprofit hfcs production 
in the fall the plants again shift into ethanol production as 
the demand for hfcs declines however seasonal demand for 
automotive fuel and presumably ethanol also declines at that 
time

the soviet union has bought an additional 
200000 metric tons of us corn for delivery this year under a 
longterm supply agreement between the two countries the 
agriculture department says 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 200000 tons of 
corn announced wednesday would be about 79 million bushels 
corn prices recently have been averaging about 183 per bushel 
at the farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of 
around 145 million 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
with the latest purchases the soviets now have bought 347 
million tons of corn plus more than 69 million tons of wheat 
813300 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

an agriculture department report says thailand 
may import soybeans for the first time since 1981 due to drought

quota for soybean meal feed mills and livestock producers 
meanwhile have turned to other oilseed meals not restricted by 
quotas such as sunflowerseed meal and peanut meal 
meanwhile the united states has been working to liberalize 
thailands oilseed trade by encouraging the thai government to 
use import tariffs instead of the current system which includes 
bans on imported soybeans a quota on soybean meal and licensing

talk of a brokered convention is making some 
democrats shudder while former house speaker thomas p tip 
oneill says he thinks it would be a lot of fun and other party 
leaders say the scenario probably will be avoided one way or 
another 
a brokered convention is nothing said oneill on wednesday 
evening he recalled the brokered 1952 convention that nominated 
adlai stevenson and said it was enjoyable it makes it more 
fun 
if i had my way they talk about the smokefilled rooms we 
ought to open them up to the tv and the press he said in an 
interview wednesday night 
sen paul simons favoriteson primary victory in illinois on 
tuesday brought the brokered convention speculation to the fore 
along with concerns that the democrats could only be hurt by such a 
lack of unity 
new york gov mario cuomo who some hope would emerge the 
nominee if there were a deadlocked convention condemned the 
possibility as the best way to give this election away to the 
republicans 
he joined democratic national committee chairman paul kirk in 
calling for the democratic leadership to unify behind the 
frontrunner when the primary season ends in june rather than wait 
until the july convention in atlanta 
simon reviving his faltering campaign took most of the 
delegates in illinois with the other homestate candidate jesse 
jackson coming in second and taking the rest of the delegates 
simon said no one will have enough delegates to lock up the 
nomination before the convention and added were going to have 
to work out some kind of a compromise 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who currently holds a slim 
lead in delegates said the party should unite behind the 
frontrunner at the end of the primary season and that encouraging 
a brokered convention would be a very dangerous thing 
i think there is agreement on the part of most democrats 
across the country that somebody will come out of this primary 
process with if not an absolute majority a substantial plurality 
and that people will rally behind that person obviously i 
hope i will be that person the governor said in boston 
but other prominent democrats interviewed wednesday at a 
congressional dinner professed not to be worried about the 
deadlocked convention prospect mostly because they dont think it 
will come to that 
nobody said the process had to end by march said sen john 
kerry of massachusetts chairman of the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee 
but he said he thinks his candidate dukakis will have enough 
delegates to take the nomination by june and that the process is 
going to work its way out 
former virginia gov charles robb who opted not to seek the 
presidential nomination this year said he doubts anyone will have 
a winning cache of delegates in june but he predicted that the 
party would unite behind a candidate before the convention 
nonetheless he added i dont fear a brokered convention 
i dont think any harm comes from it 
after illinois dukakis had 4645 delegate votes jackson 46055 
and simon 1715 sen albert gore jr of tennessee had 3548 and 
rep richard gephardt of missouri 145 uncommitted delegates 
totaled 27265 of the 2082 needed to win the nomination 
boosted by his illinois win simon plans to campaign vigorously 
for the upcoming michigan caucuses march 26 and the wisconsin 
primary april 5 
gore who fared poorly in illinois said he is almost 
prepared to agree that the race will still be fluid at the 
convention 
i still think this process is likely to produce a winner 
before the first ballot is over gore said the results from 
illinois make it more likely we will go to a second ballot 
gephardt who skipped illinois to try to resuscitate his 
campaign in michigan said the democratic battle could go all the 
way 
the race is wide open he said in kalamazoo mich i think 
if i can get a good result in michigan which i think i can im 
going to be back in the middle of this thing and have a great 
chance to be the nominee 
house speaker jim wright of texas said wednesday night he 
anticipated he would be involved in any discussions to unite behind 
a candidate before the convention if no one had the winning number 
of delegates in june 
he said a brokered convention wouldnt be the worst thing but 
added all things considered it would be desirable if it didnt 
happen 
sen bill bradley of new jersey on wednesday signaled the 
likelihood that he too would help in early selection of a 
nominee first he told party leaders in his home state that he 
would endorse a candidate before the primary there june 7 with 
dukakis the favorite for his backing 
and he said party leaders should halt an effort to put together 
an uncommitted delegate slate for the state victory for such a 
slate he said could cause problems for the frontrunning 
candidate when the primary is held

independent counsel lawrence e walsh is 
leaving the door open for further criminal charges in the 
irancontra affair following the indictment of lt col oliver 
north and three others on charges of deceitfully exploiting 
us weapons sales to iran 
the 23count indictment charging that north former national 
security adviser john poindexter and two weapons dealers engaged in 
a criminal conspiracy is simply an interim report of the grand 
jurys 14month investigation walsh told reporters 
the grand jury is not finished walsh said wednesday after 
the panel returned the 101page indictment against north 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord 
grand jurors will continue to meet because they have 
uncompleted investigations walsh said refusing to say if more 
criminal charges would be brought 
the indictment charges that the defendants circumvented a 
statutory ban on us military aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
by deceitfully and without legal authorization setting up a 
clandestine private arms supply network 
it also says the four conspired to defraud the government by 
deceitfully exploiting for their own purposes and corrupting the 
us arms sales to iran that were approved by president reagan in 
an attempt to win release of american hostages in lebanon 
the us government was cheated out of its rightful proceeds 
from the sale of 30 million dollars worth of weaponry to iran the 
indictment said the government received only 122 million 
all four defendants were charged with conspiracy theft of 
government property and wire fraud stemming from the diversion of 
armssale profits to the contras to swiss bank accounts controlled 
by hakim and secord 
together these charges carry a maximum 25year sentence and 
each of the three counts has a potential fine of 250000 
the indictment raises the question of whether reagan will issue 
pardons to those charged or convicted as a result of the 
irancontra affair reagan who has refused to rule out pardons for 
his former aides had no response to the latest development in 
the scandal said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
north who was fired from his white house post in november 1986 
was named in 16 counts he also was charged with obstructing 
attorney general edwin meese iiis nov 2123 1986 investigation 
by making false statements and destroying national security council 
documents 
secord and hakim were additionally charged with conspiring to 
pay north illegal gratuities by agreeing to set up a 200000 swiss 
bank account for the marine officers family and to pay for the 
installation of a security system at norths home in great falls 
va 
north was accused of accepting the security system and pocketing 
4500 of 90000 in travelers checks he received from a contra 
leader to cover expenses of helping the rebels 
the gratuities were offered to encourage north to continue in 
his position at the white house so secord and hakim would 
continue to receive opportunities for substantial revenues and 
profits from the arms sales the indictment said 
secord and north agreed the enterprise would keep most of 
the proceeds from the sale of tow missiles to iran in february 
1986 the indictment said 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral also was charged with 
four counts of obstructing congressional inquiries and deleting 
national security council computer records shortly after the 
irancontra affair unraveled in november 1986 
last week another of reagans former national security 
advisers robert c mcfarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor 
charges of withholding information from congress about the covert 
aid efforts 
north also was charged with illegally using a taxexempt 
foundation the national endowment for the preservation of liberty 
to raise 32 million for the contras 
north who was fired from the nsc staff in november 1986 told 
reporters i did not commit any crime i intend to fight the 
allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary 
the case was assigned to us district judge gerhard gesell 77 
an appointee of president johnson who presided at one of the 
watergate trials and ruled in favor of the washington posts 
publication of the pentagon papers 
secord said on abctvs nightline that the charges were 
crazy 
were going to defend this case successfully he said 
n richard janis who represents hakim said we believe 
strongly that mr hakim has committed no crimes and that this 
indictment is unfair and unwarranted poindexters lawyer 
richard beckler told the washington post that were going to 
vigorously contest this case

president reagans top economic advisers have 
urged a twoweek delay in proposed action seeking to open japans 
multibillion construction market to us companies administration 
officials say 
the delay backed on tuesday by reagans cabinetlevel economic 
policy committee will permit time for lastditch negotiations 
requested by japan to resolve the dispute said officials who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
however if the negotiations to begin this weekend fail 
then the administration is likely to proceed with the trade case 
which could result in stiff retaliatory tariffs against japan the 
sources said 
the council headed by treasury secretary james a baker iii 
put off a recommendation by senior staff members calling for 
presidential action against japan on the issue pending the result 
of the talks the sources said 
japan will send a special negotiating team to washington this 
weekend to meet with us officials in an effort to end the bitter 
dispute said the officials 
they proposed sending a highlevel representative to meet with 
us weve taken them up on it said one administration official 
present at the cabinet session 
the cabinet unit agreed that there would be no 
preconditions on the negotiations and that the results would 
have to be satisfactory to both nations for further action to be 
abandoned the official said 
failure of us construction companies to win contracts on 
japanese public works projects including the new 8 billion kansai 
international airport has been a major trade irritant between the 
two nations 
last month top administration staff members recommended that 
president reagan initiate a trade action against japan on grounds 
that japan has resisted opening its construction market to us 
companies 
according to the sources commerce secretary c william verity 
opened tuesdays session with a call for initiation of the trade 
action against japan an action that could result in tariffs equal 
to the amount of lost business to us construction companies 
however the cabinet was told of a new offer by japan to resolve 
the dispute and the group agreed to await the result of the 
twoweek talks before recommending further action to president 
reagan the sources said 
us construction companies claim they have been all but barred 
from bidding on such projects in japan some 60 billion of 
japanese construction projects are at stake according to industry 
officials 
japanese prime minister naburo takeshita in his visit with 
president reagan earlier this year brought with him a proposal he 
said would open more japanese construction projects to us 
companies 
however the administration said that the proposal which 
focused on joint ventures between us and japanese companies did 
not go nearly far enough 
japanse construction firms by contrast do an estimated 18 
billion worth of business each year in the united states 
however congress late last year voted to ban future japanese 
participation in us public works projects which include planned 
work on a segment of the washington subway system until the issue 
is resolved 
us construction industry officials have claimed that japanese 
red tape for bidding on such projects in japan makes it virtually 
impossible for americans to win contracts 
for instance they claim one requirement for participation in 
such projects is extensive prior experience on similar japanese 
projects experience that us industry officials claim it is 
almost impossible for american outfits to acquire

three times as many americans would raise 
taxes rather than cut medicare and other social programs to reduce 
the federal budget deficit according to a survey released today 
but a third option cutting defense spending was favored by 
the majority of those questioned in a gallup poll 
the american public clearly is not inclined to cut entitlement 
programs in order to reduce the federal budget deficit said 
gallup vice president harry cotugno in an analysis of the poll 
the telephone survey of 1014 people from jan 1023 found 10 
percent approved of cutting entitlement programs 33 percent 
favored higher taxes and 59 percent cutting defense spending 
that left 87 percent disapproving of cutting entitlement 
programs in the questionnaires words such as social 
security medicare and the like 
the raise taxes option disapproved by 52 percent did not 
specify which taxes and the cut spending on defense 
disapproved by 36 percent likewise did not specify where the cuts 
would come 
the totals of those approving and disapproving the three options 
exceeds 100 percent because each person was asked to give an 
opinion on each of the options not pick one of the three 
the survey was commissioned by the federation of american health 
systems a trade organization representing about 1300 private 
hospitals and released in conjunction with its annual convention 
health advisers to several presidential candidates including 
vice president george bush and massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
were scheduled to appear on a panel today 
one of the questions in the survey asked whether respondents 
would be more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate who 
favored a large increase in defense spending cuts in medicare or 
medicaid and increasing taxes 
threequarters said they would be less likely to vote for a 
candidate who favored medicare or medicaid cuts and 65 percent said 
they would be less likely to support a candidate advocating more 
defense spending 
cotugno said those figures showed a significant shift from a 
similar survey taken for newsweek in 1982 
the proportion likely to vote for a candidate in favor of 
increased spending for defense has been cut in half from 28 
percent to 12 percent while the proportion who are less likely to 
vote for such a candidate has risen from 44 percent in 1982 to 65 
percent this year he said 
just under half 49 percent said they would be less likely to 
support a candidate who favored increasing taxes and 26 percent 
said such a stand would make them more likely to vote for a 
candidate with a taxraising position 
another question gave four if you had to choose options for 
reducing the deficit 
given that choice 43 percent said take money from defense 21 
percent said give up a portion of the next phase of the federal 
tax cut 18 percent said give up having a balanced budget and 3 
percent said take money from health care programs the rest had no 
opinion 
the margin of error for the poll was 4 percentage points

here is the text of the letter from honduran 
president jose azcona to president reagan 
his excellency tegucigalpa 
ronald reagan march 15 1988 
president of the united states 
washington dc 
dear mr president 
i have the honor of addressing your excellency first of all to 
inform you that today nicarauga army troops crossed the border 
limits between honduras and nicaragua attacking with artillery 
fire and combat aircraft support locations situated in honduran 
territory in southeast olancho department 
with the purpose of preventing the worsening of the situation on 
the frontier i have demanded of president ortega that he order his 
troops to abstain from violating national territory and 
immediately redeploy to their territory the military units that 
have invaded honduras 
i have also communicated with presidents jose napoleon duarte 
vinicio cerezo and oscar arias sanchez to ask that they demand that 
the government of nicaragua stop its aggression against honduras 
and remove the troops from the border region 
my government exercising the right of legitimate defense 
consecrated in article 51 of the charter of the united nations has 
proceeded immediately to execute the necessary actions to repel the 
invasion of which it is the object ordering its armed forces to 
repulse the troops of the sandinista popular army 
in view of the unjustifiable aggression and the evident 
disadvantage in which in terms of numbers of military forces and 
armaments my country finds itself in relation to the aggressor 
forces my government finds itself forced to appeal for continental 
solidarity to repel the aggression of which it is subject and to 
reestablish peace in the region 
the actions taken by the invading army represent before 
international law an act of aggression that as a result should be 
considered as an attack against all the states of the american 
continent 
therefore in conformity with what is established in the cited 
article 51 of the charter of the united nations in articles 3 8 
and 9 of the interamerican treaty for reciprocal assistance by 
virtue of the special security relations existing between our two 
states and the dispositions of the military assistance agreement 
that was signed on the 20th of may 1954 i find myself required to 
ask your illustrious government for effective and immediate 
assistance to maintain the sovereign and territorial integrity of 
my country 
i have the conviction that you share with me mr president 
that certainty that combined action by both nations is necessary to 
defeat this new aggression of the sandinista regime 
the occasion is propitious to reiterate to your excellency the 
assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration 
signed 
jose azcona h 
president

judge margaret j kemp set tungs sentencing for may 11 tung 
faces 25 years to life in prison for murder and two years for use 
of a firearm

here is the text of a statement read by lt 
col oliver north at the office of his lawyer brendan sullivan 
after a grand jury indicted north in the irancontra case on 
wednesday 
it is a sad irony that the decision to indict me should occur 
today a day in which the communists in nicaragua invaded their 
democratic neighbor a day which is the fourth anniversary of the 
abduction of william buckley and the third anniversary of the 
kidnapping of terry anderson two of the american hostages we tried 
so hard to rescue 
hopefully mr anderson is still alive and will be freed soon 
the indictment is also sad for our country for all the men and 
women who work to protect it and to make our government work 
it is a particularly painful thing to my wife betsy our four 
children and me 
throughout my service as a marine officer i have always done my 
very best often working night and day to get the job done and to 
do so honorably 
i am proud of my service to our country and those with whom i 
have served both in the marine corps and on the national security 
council 
unfortunately i have now been caught in a bitter dispute 
between the congress and the president over the control of foreign 
policy the power of the president to deter communism in central 
america and the presidents duty to protect our citizens against 
terrorist acts abroad 
it is a shame that the new battleground for such a fight will be 
a courtroom 
i did not commit any crime 
i intend to fight allegations of wrongdoing for as long as 
necessary 
i recognize that opposing a prosecutor with an unlimited budget 
a staff of 30 lawyers 50 investigators scores of support 
personnel is a formidable task for me and my counsel brendan 
sullivan 
there are enormous costs involved both personal and financial 
the months ahead will be difficult and often very lonely 
nonetheless i can assure you i will never give up we will win 
i just cannot tell you how soon 
and finally to the american people who have shown so much love 
and concern these past 16 months by their millions of telegrams and 
letters and prayers and support i want to tell you again how 
extremely grateful i am for that 
you have helped my family and me find the strength to endure 
this seemingly endless ordeal in washington 
you have shown your appreciation for what we did accomplish and 
what we tried to achieve 
for that i thank you again god bless you

there are altogether well there are three counts which 
include all four defendants 
the first is conspiracy to defraud the united states which 
consists of a charge of three illegal objectives the first of 
those objectives is to impair and obstruct the compliance with 
legal requirements for government covert activities by organizing 
directing and concealing a program of support for the paramilitary 
activities in nicaragua by the contras at a time when the boland 
act was in effect and when other restrictions on covert activities 
were in effect 
i note parenthetically that it does not charge a violation of 
the boland act it charges the objective of conducting unauthorized 
covert activities 
the second objective of the conspiracy as charged is the use 
or is the the use of private individuals by the government 
employee defendants to generate a fund which could be used without 
government accountability for the conduct of covert activities 
including the support of the paramilitary activities in nicaragua 
of the contras 
and the third charged illegal objective of the conspiracy is to 
deprive the to defraud the united states by depriving it of the 
full control of the iranian initiative by using the by corrupting

activities designated by the government employee defendants

two charge efforts by secord and hakim to supply gratuities to 
north and one charges a gift by secord of the security system 
another charges the acceptance by north of the security system and 
another charges north with obstruction of our investigation by 
developing false documents to conceal his acceptance of that gift 
the next count charges norths conversion of travelers checks 
which he received from calero a contra leader for government 
purposes 
q judge could you

a i cant comment on their investigation and indeed i can 
comment even less after this indictment than i could before which 
was not very much

return indictments 
a well they have uncompleted investigations 
im just talking in the abstract now not saying what reasons 
they might have 
but i cannot discuss the grand jurys activities

badia ghatia aljabiri stood disconsolately 
outside what was left of his downtown hotel after it was hit by a 
sovietmade katyusha rocket fired by iranian revolutionary guards a 
few miles to the east 
ill need a fortune to get it repaired he lamented as he 
viewed the facade tuesday the front wall had collapsed into the 
street but thank god nobody was hurt 
aljabiris ibn kholdoun hotel was empty because most people 
have fled to safer areas out of reach of the relentless iranian 
bombardment 
basra once iraqs secondlargest city once again is taking a 
hammering in the renewed war of the city between iran and iraq 
it has borne the brunt of the iranian bombardment of border cities 
aljabiri is like many basrans who are defying the iranian 
barrages and staying in their city after 7 years of war 
shells and missiles hit the city day and night the iranians are 
dug in a scant six miles east of the city that straddles the shatt 
alarab waterway 
it is formed by the confluence of the euphrates and tigris 
rivers that forms the southern border between iraq and iran 
official statistics released this month in baghdad showed that 
basra was hit by iranian artillery and missiles 179 times last 
year most of the 776 civilians listed as killed in iraqi cities 
last year died in basra the report said 
aljabiri lives with his wife 10 children and his mother in the 
andalus district he said they have no intention of leaving 
where would we go he said i was born in this city my 
kids have grown up here and know no other place if were going to 
die then let us die here 
in the latest round of missile air and artillery attacks that 
began sunday after a shortlived ceasefire officials said eight 
civilians have been killed in basra and 20 others wounded the low 
casualty rate was because most of the basrans who are toughing it 
out live in shelters or basements 
but the citys governor anwar omar alhadithi told reporters 
basra that nearly 50 civilians have been killed and 250 wounded 
since feb 29 
in that period he said 164 houses 49 shops and 150 vehicles 
have been destroyed and 200 residences badly damaged 
the iranians have fired nearly 3000 shells and 183 shortrange 
rockets into basra in that time he said 
despite the destruction life goes on normally in several part 
of the city with shops government offices and the university open 
the barrage has hit mosques schools and hospitals in the 
ancient city founded by caliph omer bin alkhatab in 637 ad and 
reputedly the starting point for the legendary voyages of sinbad 
the sailor 
some basrans especially those in the hardesthit central 
section of town have sought shelter in nearby towns or in the 
citys western outskirts 
the authorities make no attempt to stop those who want to leave 
but supply temporary prefabricated homes for anyone who wants one 
on basras western edge 
if they want to leave they can go anywhere they like 
alhadithi said at his heavily sandbagged headquarters if they 
want to stay they can stay 
alhadithi estimated that 40 percent of the prewar population 
of more than 15 million has left the city in recent years leaving 
about 870000 people 
many basrans were caught by the latest round of shelling they 
had just returned to their homes believing that the ceasefire 
would hold but it lasted only two days 
the renewed bombardment put many basrans on the run again 
we thought that the shelling had stopped so we went back 
home said jassim jabar najim 67 i even reopened my shop and 
arranged to start business again when a shell hit near the shop and 
i was hit in the hip by sharpnel 
najim interviewed from his bed in basras general hospital 
said he has repaired his house four times but this time im 
going to leave it until the war is over 
as he spoke shells exploded in the eastern part of the city

israel is arresting arab 
activists like pharmacist assad saftawi some of whom may have done 
nothing illegal in its effort to end three months of violence in 
the occupied territories 
saftawi 53 also is headmaster of a an elementary school run by 
the united nations in the bureij refugee camp he joined the 
fundamentalist moslem brotherhood as a youth in egypt and later 
spent four years in an israeli jail for working with the palestine 
liberation organization 
alaa his 25yearold son said five israeli soldiers took 
saftawi from the stone house on a dirt street of gaza citys sabra 
district sunday adding him to a growing list of palestinians being 
held without trial for up to six months 
authorities use administrative detention as part of its effort 
to break the rebellion which palestinians call the uprising 
that began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip 
the army reported 212 detentions up to feb 26 the arabrun 
human rights group law in the service of man put the number at 232 
through march 13 compared with 193 for all of 1987 
it is used as an attempt to take out any potential leadership 
the community might have said fatah azzem a member of the group 
based in the west bank town of ramallah it is a method of 
punishment for people who are active and not necessarily illegally 
active 
the army confirmed saftawi was in administrative detention but 
a spokesman would not say what he had done or what threat he was 
thought to pose 
saftawi a squarely built man who favors the long arab robe 
called the djellaba is an ardent nationalist who was severely 
critical of occupation in an interview a few days before his arrest 
as another son served glasses of tea and tiny blue cups of 
strong sweet coffee saftawi spoke with pride of his second son 
imad a member of a fundamentalist organization he has six sons 
and three daughters 
imad 24 became a local hero in gaza after escaping from jail 
and making his way abroad last year saftawi credits his his son 
and imads friends with setting the stage for the rebellion 
by their actions and their success they gave confidence to the 
palestinian people to depend on themselves to be 
selfsufficient saftawi said during the interview in his diwan 
or arabstyle reception room 
he contrasted the confidence of youth to the passivity of those 
who were adults when israel captured the territories from jordan 
and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
we were deceived believing that the arabs or islam or the 
united nations would do something for us he said but this 
group made people believe we could depend on ourselves they 
planted the seed of something new 
the pharmacist and teacher was candid in criticizing the plo 
which he said encouraged palestinians to await deliverance from the 
outside 
there is no doubt that the plos original leadership belongs 
to the older generation and was captive to old ideas especially 
the idea that we as palestinian people were unable to do 
anything he said 
his comments had an element of selfcriticism because saftawi 
by his own account has been associated with the plo for more than 
three decades 
in the early 1950s in cairo he was in the moslem brotherhood a 
fundamentalist group founded by hassan al banna in 1929 i 
belonged to the only group at the time that was willng to make 
sacrifices saftawi said 
egyptian authorities cracked down on the brotherhood in 1955 so 
saftawi and fellow students like yasser arafat and salah khalaf 
now the top two plo leaders formed a new faction 
their group the nucleus arafats future fatah guerrillas made 
raids into israel but saftawi said he did not participate in them 
saftawi was arrested in 1973 six years after israel took gaza 
from egypt and convicted of handling plo funds he spent four 
years in jail 
imad was 9 at the time and took on responsibility for feeding 
the family by working at odd jobs saftawi said 
he became the breadwinner for the whole family and took care 
of my parents the father said if i count the hours i saw my 
son while i was in jail it was not more than 10 
saftawi said imad went to the islamic university in gaza city 
and joined the moslem brotherhood then formed his own group

investigators are looking for a primetime prowler 
who slips into homes to take cash and jewelry while the residents 
are watching television 
at least 55 such burglaries have occurred since december in the 
denver area police say 
its a little bizarre sgt pat whitman of nearby cherry 
hills village said wednesday most burglars would rather find an 
empty house than a resident inside 
denver sgt bill wiederspan says hes no psychiatrist but he 
has theories 
either its psychological and he does it for the thrills or 
hes imitating burglars on tv shows and hes been watching too much 
tv he said 
in as many as six houses a night a prowler has entered usually 
through unlocked doors or windows and fled with a few selected 
items such as rifles jewelry boxes wallets or purses 
the first possible confrontation with the primetime prowler 
occurred monday night when a cherry hills resident came out of the 
shower to find a stranger in his home 
what are you doing here the resident asked 
dont worry im just leaving said the tall slender young 
stranger backing away and fleeing out a back door a watch later 
was discovered missing authorities said 
the intruder whose visits last only a few minutes is so neat 
that many victims dont realize for some time that anyone has been 
in the house in a few instances the homeowner has heard something 
and the prowler has fled emptyhanded 
but authorities fear violence is not far away 
i think its just a matter of time wiederspan said

reported incursions by nicaraguan troops into 
honduras in pursuit of contra rebels have marked the recent history 
of the sixyear nicaraguan civil war but the present us reaction 
is the strongest yet 
the white house said wednesday it was sending 3200 american 
infantry and airborne troops to honduras today as an emergency 
deployment readiness exercise the white house says the action 
was prompted by what it called the invasion of neighboring honduras 
by 1500 to 2000 nicaraguan forces 
the us troops were to be kept 125 miles from the area of 
reported hostilities spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the last such incident was late in november 1986 honduras said 
a sandinista force of 2500 soldiers crossed the border in a bid to 
stall the contras from mounting a dryseason offensive 
honduras which claimed the sandinistas had moved at least nine 
miles deep into the country responded by having us helicopters 
airlift about 3000 honduran troops to the area 
there was some smallscale combat between the sandinistas and 
hondurans and the hondurans bombed and strafed suspected 
sandinista positions with frenchbuilt super mystere and old 
usmade a37 jet fighters 
nicaragua denied that its troops crossed over and no casualty 
figures were released 
in late march 1986 us officials said about 1500 nicaraguan 
troops were operating nine miles to 15 miles inside honduras 
the sandinista government initially denied the charge but 
president daniel ortega acknowledged border crossings which he 
claimed were totally defensive operations 
the week before that incursion the house had voted 222210 
against president reagans request for 100 million in aid to the 
contras the senate approved the money four days after the 
administration announced the incursion and an aid package was 
passed in august 
at the time of the incursion reagan approved 20 million in 
emergency assistance to the hondurans and us helicopters ferried 
about 600 honduran soldiers to the area from the palmerola air base 
where the troops were being flown today 
honduran military sources said 200 sandinistas were killed 16 
captured and others injured during the incursion which lasted less 
than a week forty contras were reportedly killed 
other us officials later scaled back their estimate of the 
number of sandinista troops involved in the border crossing to 
about 800

aids may force the growing populations of some 
developing countries into decline decades after the first aids 
virus infection according to computer projections published today 
but another study says that at the worst aids could cut the 
growth rate of a typical central african country in half 
its a disaster from any point of view said john bongaarts 
of the population council in new york who did the second study 
todays projections appear in the british journal nature 
they say that with low to moderate infection rates like those of 
kenya uganda or zaire population declines would not begin until 
20 to 70 years after the aids virus invades a developing country 
even one with low growth rates 
the researchers stressed that their projections are crude and 
said too little is known about aids to make more realistic ones 
it is clear that aids will have an impact on swelling 
population growth rates but by how much is too sensitive to things 
we dont know about with sufficient certititude said robert may 
of princeton university who did the study with roy anderson and 
ar mclean of imperial college in london 
any firm longterm projection about whether aids will or 
will not bring about zero or even negative rates of growth in 
africa cannot be made 
in a telephone interview may said the projections do not 
pertain to the united states or any other developed country 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in africa is thought to 
spread mainly through heterosexual contact while most cases in the 
united states stem from homosexual contact or needle sharing by 
intravenous drug abusers 
the researchers said they found potential for eventual 
population decline under a range of plausible assumptions for such 
factors as the fraction of infected people who will die from aids 
the fraction of infected womens babies who are born infected and 
the length of time the virus lies dormant before causing aids 
projections are severely limited by lack of precise knowledge on 
such points may said 
the federal centers for disease control estimates that an 
infected woman runs a 30 percent to 60 percent chance of giving 
birth to an infected baby and that 20 percent to 30 percent of 
people infected with the virus develop aids within five years the 
cdc has no figure on the percentage of infected people who 
eventually die from aids a spokesman said 
one series of projections in nature assumed an initial 4 percent 
growth rate like that of kenya where the population doubles about 
every 16 years and residents have a normal life expectancy of 52 
years 
assuming an eightyear dormant period for the virus one 
projection forecast eventual population decline if half or 30 
percent of babies born to infected mothers are infected at birth 
a second projection took the same basic assumptions set the 
infectednewborn rate at 50 percent and found eventual population 
decline if every infected person dies of aids 
bongaarts said his projections come out differently because he 
divided the hypothetical population into groups of high medium and 
low risk for aids 
he also said that very implausible estimates of the 
prevalence of aids virus infection would be needed to project zero 
population growth or population decline 
his projections in the worst case find aids cutting the 3 
percent growth rate typical of central african nations in half 
more likely is a reduction to 2 percent he said 
but even that implies a doubling of the death rate leading to 
an overwhelmed health care system and disrupted social structure 
he said

scientists reported today they have found the 
approximate location of a defective gene causing an inherited 
tendency toward kidney cancer and that the gene also may help 
cause kidney cancer in general 
genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes the 
gene in the study is in a general area already associated with 
genetic abnormality in kidney cancer the researchers said 
if the gene plays a role in kidney cancer which strikes some 
18000 americans a year studying it may lead to better diagnosis 
and treatment another expert said 
the gene is now linked to von hippellindau disease for which 
only a few hundred cases are known in the united states according 
to the national organization for rare disorders 
usually striking in young adulthood the disease can cause 
tumors in the eye brain and spinal cord that can damage eyesight 
and nerve function about 40 percent of people with the disease 
develop kidney cancer usually in both kidneys and their prognosis 
is poor researchers say 
genes are chemical sequences that lie along chromosomes in every 
cell of the body 
the us canadian british and dutch scientists whose study is 
reported in todays issue of the british journal nature used a 
marker which is a chemical sequence at a known location on a 
chromosome and can be inherited along with a gene if it is close 
enough 
in a study of 203 members of nine families including 71 who had 
von hippellindau disease the marker was inherited along with the 
defective gene 90 percent of the time said james gusella of 
massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school 
other studies have found that stretches of the chromosome 
numbered 3 are missing in some kidney cancers the new work shows 
that the defective gene causing von hippellindau disease resides 
in the same general portion of the chromosome as the deletions 
researchers said 
so the defective gene or a nearby one may play a role in at 
least some sporadic kidney cancers gusella said 
he explained that in its normal form the gene may protect 
against kidney cancer every cell gets two copies of a gene so if 
one copy is defective as in von hippellindau disease the cell 
has only one normal copy left if that copy is damaged or deleted 
during a persons lifetime the cell could turn cancerous gusella 
said 
under that theory people without von hippellindau disease 
could get kidney cancer if both normal copies are damaged or 
deleted during their lifetimes 
the next step for researchers will be to find the gene and 
isolate it for study 
w marston linehan of the national cancer institute who has 
studied chromosome deletions in kidney cancer called the finding 
very significant work that may help in learning about development 
of kidney cancer 
such new understanding might lead to better diagnosis and 
treatment he said

col leonidas macias the alleged 
leader of a failed coup in recent months had been a staunch 
defender of the nations military strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
when president eric arturo delvalle tried unsuccessfully to 
remove noriega as chief of the 15000member defense forces on feb 
25 it was macias who heatedly told reporters that delvalle himself 
would go before noriega 
within hours delvalle was deposed by the legislative assembly 
in a noriegaorchestrated move 
during the past year macias about 50 has been chief of police 
a job that put him in charge of about 5000 officers and 
administrative employees 
they include the riot police who have forcibly put down street 
demonstrations against the government since last june 
but after light arms fire broke out in the defense forces 
headquarters on wednesday the military said that macias three 
majors a captain and some civilians were arrested after an 
attempt by several officers to take over the headquarters of our 
institution was foiled 
panamas civil unrest began after accusations last summer that 
noriega was involved in crimes ranging from political assassination 
to drug trafficking 
noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in florida last 
month 
some of those arrested in the antinoriega demonstrations have 
accused macias of allowing others to beat them while in custody 
one of those detained told the oppositionaligned human rights 
association that macias took part in at least one beating macias 
denied the accusations 
macias had conducted a public relations campaign with reporters 
to counter the antinoriega drive holding several news conferences 
to report on events in the defense forces he was the only 
highranking officer to do so 
in recent months macias called three news conferences one 
christmas lunch and invited journalists to his home always saying 
in a jovial manner that nothing was happening 
during a protest strike that began feb 29 macias took 
journalists around the city on a bus saying look theres 
nothing happening here everything is fine look at me im 
unarmed what policeman like myself can move around the streets of 
his city without being armed 
but he could be harsh with the opposition 
on feb 29 he took chamber of commerce president aurelio 
barria who had been arrested a few hours earlier before 
reporters clown he yelled at barria look at him hes 
fine you can go home 
barria was detained for trying to enter the chamber of commerce 
building which had been closed by the government four days earlier 
although macias was considered one of the colonels most loyal to 
noriega there had been rumors before wednesday that while they 
kept up the appearance of good relations there were problems 
between the two men

carl and karen hawkinson will be taking a 
trip to new orleans together this summer as delegates to the 
republican national convention but thats where the togetherness 
ends 
the couple were elected tuesday as gop delegates but he 
supports kansas sen bob dole and she backs vice president george 
bush 
we didnt really expect to both be elected but thats the way 
it turned out hawkinson said 
even though bush is the frontrunner mrs hawkinson said 
winning her delegate slot was a surprise because dole was 
considered the favorite in their congressional district 
her husbands win was not as as unpredictable she said 
carl has held office since 1976 people are used to voting 
for him she said but i had never been on a ballot before 
the two said campaigning for rival candidates made their home 
life a little hectic but they avoided the kind of spats that have

lt col oliver north says he will fight the 
criminal allegations against him for as long as necessary 
despite heavy personal and financial costs 
i did not commit any crime north said wednesday a few hours 
after a federal grand jury indicted him and three others on 
conspiracy charges stemming from the irancontra affair i intend 
to fight allegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary 
appearing ashenfaced and grim north said he was aware of the 
high personal and financial costs of fighting the charges but i 
can assure you i will never give up we will win 
north thanked the american people who have shown so much love 
and concern these past 16 months by their millions of telegrams and 
letters and prayers and support 
the marine officer said that he was caught in the crossfire of 
a bitter dispute between congress and the president over central 
america and that it is a shame the new battleground for such a 
fight will be in a courtroom 
beside north was his lawyer brendan sullivan who also 
represented north at last summers hearings before joint committees 
of the senate and house 
sullivan whose spirited defense of his client was one of the 
highlights of the hearings said that seeking wednesdays 
indictment was one of the worst prosecutorial decisions in the 
history of our country 
it is a decision of an unaccountable prosecutor who came to 
washington determined to allege that some crime any crime had been 
committed sullivan said 
sullivan added that lawrence e walsh the independent counsel 
presents an indictment after 15 months of investigation based 
on mistaken facts novel and sometimes ridiculous legal theories 
everyone must seriously wonder about a decision to indict a 
man like oliver north a highly decorated marine corps officer 
based on his tireless effort in the interests of his country 
sullivan said 
for his part north said it was a sad irony that the decision to 
indict should occur on the fourth anniversary of the abduction in 
lebanon of william buckley and the third anniversary of the 
kidnapping of terry anderson the associated press chief middle 
east correspondent

officers in such areas as building searches response techniques 
and hostage negotiations 
it was excellent training hansen said wednesday i 
checked them out and found out they were very reputable and 
knowledgeable in their areas of expertise 
they are extremely competent and detailed in what they do

35yearold roberts said tuesday during a stop in tallahassee 
as he pedals his 8footlong recumbent bicycle he captures 
those catchy phrases that once vanished in the wind with the help 
of four keys on each handlebar a computer screen in front of him 
a program to translate his coded tappings into words and a radio 
communications system 
someone asked if he had any idea of what he looked like on his 
bicycle and a puzzled expression appeared on his face his 
traveling companion maggie victor chuckled 
we look so absurd going down the highway that we really get 
better treatment than most bicyclists our absurd look is really 
our security system she said 
roberts from columbus ohio began his adventure when he had 
his first custom bike built in 1983 computing across america

scientists said today they have found embryo 
skeletons from two kinds of dinosaurs in montana and that the 
bones give further evidence that some dinosaurs may have tended 
their young like birds 
the discovery some 60 miles southeast of glacier national park 
is reported in the british journal nature 
the animals lived some 75 million to 80 million years ago john 
r horner curator of paleontology at the museum of the rockies in 
bozeman mont said in a telephone interview 
nineteen embryonic skeltons were found in a clutch of eggs laid 
by a previously unnamed type of dinosaur which horner and david 
weishampel of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in 
baltimore propose calling orodromeus makelai 
that animal walked on its hind legs and grew perhaps eight feet 
long the embryos would be about eight or nine inches long when 
stretched out horner said 
researchers also found parts of seven embryonic skeletons of the 
duckbilled maiasaura peeblesorum which also walked walked on hind 
legs and grew to be 30 feet long he said the embryos were about 
one foot long he said 
juvenile and adult specimens of each dinosaur were found with 
the embryos 
horner said embryonic bones of the newly named dinosaur were 
very well developed while those of the duckbilled dinosaur had 
not developed on the ends 
that is consistent with the notion that hatchlings of the newly 
named dinosaur could leave the nest soon after hatching while 
those of the other would have been bound to the nest counting on 
parents for care horner said 
an animal that is nestbound doesnt have to walk around 
right after birth so its bones need not have developed as much by 
that time he said 
kevin padian associate professor of paleontology and biology at 
the university of california berkeley said the discovery was 
very important because few dinosaur embryos have been found 
last month other researchers announced they had found a 
dinosaur egg that may contain an embryo some 150 million years old 
studies are continuing but it does appear to contain an embryo 
said paleontologist wade miller of brigham young university in 
provo utah

the defeats of extremist lyndon larouche and his 
followers in the illinois primary show the state democratic party 
learned a lesson two years ago and passed it on to voters party 
officials say 
the nation became aware of what happened in illinois in 1986 
and i think we have pretty well put that to rest said george 
sangmeister who won his democratic congressional primary tuesday 
over a larouchebacked opponent george m laurence of romeoville 
no one answered the telephone at laurences home or at larouche 
headquarters late wednesday to comment on the primary results 
sangmeister of mokena was one of two partyendorsed candidates 
who went down in a surprising defeat to larouche supporters in 
1986 sending shock waves throughout the state democratic party 
mark fairchild defeated sangmeister for the democratic 
nomination for lieutenant governor that year another larouche 
disciple janice hart beat party candidate aurelia pucinski for 
the nomination for secretary of state 
the partys state central committee declared the nominations 
void and neither larouche candidate won office 
this year despite democratic court challenges larouche and 
more than 20 of his supporters were on tuesdays primary ballot for 
offices from president to county recorder of deeds democrats 
countered with a mail campaign 
ms pucinski defeated mrs hart in the democratic primary race 
for cook county circuit court clerk and sangmeister easily 
defeated laurence for the congressional nomination 
unofficial vote totals gave sangmeister 26979 votes to 
laurences 7518 in the clerks race ms pucinski had 283504 
former mayor jane byrne had 199306 and ms hart had 12530 for 2 
percent of the vote 
larouche got 6036 votes in the presidential primary according 
to unofficial totals not even 1 percent 
two years ago the fairchild victory caused adlai e stevenson 
to give up his democratic nomination for governor saying he would 
not run with a larouche extremist stevenson calling larouches 
views neonazi then formed the illinois solidarity party but 
subsequently lost to the incumbent republican gov james r 
thompson 
larouche whose headquarters are in leesburg va is seeking 
the democratic nomination on a platform that includes quarantining 
aids patients and populating mars 
larouche is on trial in boston on federal fraud and conspiracy 
charges 
the party and i decided we were not going to afford these and 
other fringe candidates the opportunity to have a refuge here 
declared vince demuzio who became state party chairman after the 
larouche victories 
the larouche forces did win an upset this month in houston when 
claude jones was elected harris county democratic party chairman in 
the texas primary on march 8

premierdesignate ciriaco de mita said he will form 
italys 48th postwar government with a coalition of the same five 
parties that have governed the country for most of the past eight 
years 
de mita leader of the dominant christian democrats was 
appointed to the temporary post wednesday by president francesco 
cossiga 
premier giovanni goria also a christian democrat resigned last 
friday after heading a shaky fiveparty coalition for 7 months 
the 60yearold de mita said he would begin negotiations friday 
with political leaders to form a stronger coalition of the 
christian democrats socialists social democrats republicans and 
liberals the five parties have governed together off and on since 
1981 
i know that the task that i am about to take up is difficult 
laborious and complex de mita said there are many questions 
we have to face and to confront them we need political stability 
and clear accords 
once de mita obtains the party leaders pledges of support the 
next step is informing cosiga and parliament where he must win 
approval to become premier de mita cannot succeed without support 
of the socialists the no 2 party in the coalition 
socialist leader and former premier bettino craxi said wednesday 
he was not opposed to the appointment of de mita with whom he has 
often feuded but that his final support would depend on government 
policy 
among the divisive issues facing de mita is italys nuclear 
policy the governments decision last week to resume construction 
of a nuclear power plant near rome angered the socialists and 
helped force goria to resign 
also in dispute are the fate of the secret vote in parliament 
and proposals for including the tiny radical and green parties in 
the coalition 
de mita was elected in 1982 as secretary of the christian 
democrats a post many consider the most powerful political 
position in italy if he is confirmed as premier he will keep the 
position until the partys congress later this year 
de mita son of a tailor was born in nusco a small hill town 
near naples he entered politics in the 1950s after earning a law 
degree he was elected to parliament in 1963 and has held his seat 
since then serving as a minister in several governments in the 
1970s

under pressure from several dakota indians 
and indian organizations the minnesota historical society has 
apologized for displaying the remains of dakota chief little crow 
the apology wednesday did not mention little crow by name but 
expressed deep regret for the pain and anguish that the societys 
past actions have caused the indian people 
little crow was killed in the summer of 1863 a year after he 
led the dakota or sioux tribes in the great dakota confict of 
1862 the conflict came close to depopulating the minnesota 
frontier and ended with the hanging of 38 dakota braves the day 
after christmas in the largest mass execution in us history 
little crow was shot and killed by a farmer near hutchinson 
minn while picking raspberries 
the historical society put little crows remains on display from 
1879 to 1915 and kept the remains until 1971 when they were turned 
over to family members in flandreau sd for burial 
a preamble to the resolution approved wednesday said judged 
by societys standards today the exhibition of human remains and 
the treatment of them as museum artifacts is unthinkable 
the resolution did not satisfy two of little crows relatives 
who angrily confronted executive director nina archabal after the 
resolution was passed and threatened to go to higher ups to 
get a more specific apology 
lee ann tall bear a direct descendant of little crow said she 
was really sorry that our family business had to be put on public 
display 
the disposition of an ancestor was something that was done 
privately i do want to ask one thing that you let this go 
that we stop being put on display and treated like performing 
monkeys

the soviet union said it launched its first 
satellite for a paying customer today lifting the indianowned 
payload into orbit from the central asian republic of kazakhstan 
the satellite was launched at 940 am form the baikonur 
spaceport said nikolai semyonov an official in the international 
liaison office of the glavkosmos space agency 
he said the launch was the first on commercial terms with a 
foreign country or company adding that negotiations were under way 
for similar deals although no contracts have been signed yet 
in new delhi prime minister rajiv gandhi announced the 
successful launch to a cheering parliament he called it a major 
milestone in indias space program and said india was the fifth 
nation to have a remote sensing satellite the others are the 
united states soviet union france and japan 
the satellite called irs will operate for three years studying 
indias forests water resources and mineral deposits using remote 
sensing devices radio moscow said 
the soviets created glavkosmos in january 1986 to seek foreign 
customers for its launching services 
commercial satellite launching is also offered by the united 
states china and the european consortium ariane but the us 
space shuttle meant to be the workhorse for satellite launches is 
still grounded because of the january 1986 explosion of space 
shuttle challenger the ariane program also has suffered setbacks 
the soviets sent the first satellite into space in 1957 and 
have the advantage of the most experience in satellite launching 
sending aloft more spacecraft than any other country the soviets 
powerful booster rockets can also put into orbit heavier payloads 
than their western competitors 
yuri n salekov deputy director of licensintorg which works 
with glavkosmos and other soviet foreign trade organizations 
declined to say how much the launching cost on the grounds it is a 
commercial secret 
semyonov in a telephone interview said irs was launched aboard 
a vostok rocket booster and that the satellite reached orbit 
without problem 
the flight was controlled by a soviet monitoring station near 
moscow and the indian space control center in bangolore tass said 
glavkosmos officials repeatedly complain that their efforts to 
seek western buyers for soviet satellitelaunching services are 
severely hampered by western governments restrictions on the flow 
of technology the united states and other countries fear the 
soviets will steal western technology used in satellites

even as george bush savors his apparently 
insurmountable lead in the race for the republican presidential 
nomination the irancontra affair is reemerging as a grim 
political liability 
bush had no immediate reaction to wednesdays indictment of two 
former white house officials oliver l north and john m 
poindexter on charges stemming from the armstoiran initiative 
but pete teeley his chief spokesman said they werent 
unexpected and he said that what is going on with those four 
gentlemen has nothing to do with this campaign 
teeley insisted that the specter of indictments of former reagan 
administration figures had nothing to do with bushs statement last 
week that i am tired of being embarrassed by accounts of 
unethical behavior by high government officials 
that may be so but a federal grand jury and a special 
prosecutor have managed what presidential rival bob dole had been 
unable to do keep the irancontra furor in the public view 
the kansas senator had hoped to raise sufficient questions about 
bushs role in the irancontra affair to sow doubts in the minds of 
republicans about bushs electability against a democrat in 
november 
in the wake of the indictments of north and poindexter along 
with arms merchants richard secord and albert hakim bush may be 
thinking of alexander m haig jrs tart warning of jan 8 
if you cant answer your friends what in heavens name is 
going to happen next november if you are our standardbearer and 
these democrats get after you on this subject haig asked bush 
in fact rep richard gephardt of missouri a democratic 
presidential candidate said wednesday this will be an important 
issue in the campaign regardless of whether new evidence is 
revealed to further implicate the vice president 
george bush has already pleaded guilty to exercising bad 
judgment in what turned out to be the biggest american foreign 
policy debacle in decades he said 
to a certain degree bush has answered questions about his role 
in the affair although he has declined to spell out what 
reservations he had but he must cope with some lingering questions 
does he still consider lt col north a national hero 
despite the mistakes that north made 
was it appropriate for him to invite both north and vice adm 
poindexter to a christmas party at his house on the grounds of the 
naval observatory even after both had been ousted by reagan 
does he still retain confidence in his national security aide 
donald gregg a former cia agent whose name has cropped up in 
various reports linking him to norths behindthescenes efforts to 
manage the contra war against the sandinista regime in nicaragua 
gregg has been associated with felix rodriguez another onetime 
cia operative who had been involved in helping to run the secret 
resupply operation for the contras 
how does he resolve the seeming contradiction between his 
statements that he only became fully aware of the armsforhostages 
nature of the dealings with iran late in 1986 and statements by 
chief of staff craig fuller indicating that amiram nir an israeli 
counterterrorism expert had briefed bush on this aspect of the 
initiative in may 1986 
i was told what they were doing not what we were doing 
bush subsequently said 
can he explain failing to recall the strenuous objections that 
secretary of state george shultz and thendefense secretary caspar 
w weinberger raised about the arms sales shultz told 
congressional investigators he became apoplectic when he 
learned about it 
bush told reporters in adel iowa on jan 9 that he would be 
willing to make public his notes and documents on the irancontra 
affair saying it doesnt bother me to declassify some papers 
bushs reservations reportedly involved his concern as a 
onetime cia director over the possibility the united states was 
allowing israel to play too great a role a supersensitive covert 
operation 
reagan has corroborated bushs statement that the vice president 
voiced reservations about the deal but neither has said what those 
reservations were 
bush has acknowledged repeatedly that mistakes were made in 
the armstoiran initiative and the subsequent diversion to the 
nicaraguan rebels of the proceeds from the sales of antiaircraft 
and antitank missiles but he also has said that i was aware of 
the iran initiative and i support the presidents decision 
bush has said he never knew about the diversion of profits and 
the congressional investigative committees produced no evidence to 
contradict him on that 
i wish it hadnt happened he said on dec 19 1986

president oscar arias called the 
reported sandinista incursion into honduras deplorable saying it 
jeopardizes truce talks set for monday between the nicaraguan 
government and contra rebels 
a contra spokesman said the talks would be suspended unless 
sandinistas halt the offensive against contra forces in northern 
nicaragua 
being certain that the nicaraguan army invaded honduras my 
government condemns it categorically and with firmness arias 
said wednesday night 
i deplore that this happens shortly before the meeting begins 
and it appears to me lamentable because costa rica feels that the 
manner of resolving problems is through direct dialogue and not 
through war he told a news conference in san jose 
the ceasefire talks were scheduled to take place in the town of 
sapoa near nicaraguas border with costa rica arias won last 
years nobel peace prize for authoring the regional peace plan 
under which they are taking place 
carlos hurtado an adviser to the nicaraguan resistance the 
contra umbrella organization told the associated press the talks 
would be suspended if the offensive continued 
if the sandinistas pursue this offensive with the intention of 
destroying our forces it is possible that the sapoa reunion will 
be suspended hurtado said 
arias said he had spoken by telephone wednesday with presidents 
daniel ortega of nicaragua vinicio cerezo of guatemala and jose 
azcona hoyo of honduras about the situation 
ortega has said sandinista troops pushed 2000 contras into 
honduras but has not confirmed that troops entered the neighboring 
country 
after it cost us so much to have convened a reunion in sapoa 
nicaragua resorts to military action a few days before 
realizing the talks with the proposition of coming to the 
negotiating table with a better position arias said 
we are putting in danger the much or the little that we have 
achieved in the central american peace process and the eyes of the 
world are placed on the isthmus to find out what we are capable 
of he added 
the peace plan calls for ceasefires in el salvador guatemala 
and nicaragua an end to outside support for the areas 
insurgencies and negotiations aimed at installing democratic 
governments among other points 
the plan was signed by honduras nicaragua el salvador 
guatemala and costa rica

amnesty international today accused panamas 
security forces of torturing and killing people who staged peaceful 
protests against the rule of gen manuel antonio noriega 
in a 15page report the international human rights group said 
more than 1000 people have been injured in protests since last 
june when widespread opposition to noriega began 
demonstrations in the central american country started after a 
former aide of noriega accused the general of corruption election 
fraud and the 1985 assassination of a political foe 
panamanians turned into the streets last summer to demand 
noriegas resignation as head of the 15000member defense forces 
noriega is considered the real power behind panamas civilian 
government 
amnesty said hundreds of people including scores of children 
had been detained for sounding car horns raising their right arm 
or waving white handkerchiefs all symbols of protest in panama 
the report deals with rights violations in the country from june 
through january since then demonstrations against noriega have 
intensified including rioting in the two largest cities wednesday 
after a coup was aborted 
the report said the defense forces have used excessive force 
when responding to apparently nonviolent opposition to current 
government policies 
it said witnesses reported that police shot and killed eduardo 
enrique carrera 24 after he shouted down with noriega at a 
rally last july 26 
the report said said 54 former detainees and other sources had 
described a pattern of brutality by the security forces before 
during and after demonstrations 
noriega was indicted in florida last month on federal drug 
trafficking charges the united states has imposed economic 
sanctions to force noriegas resignation that have left the 
government unable to pay public employees 
amnesty said troops have harassed beaten and arbitrarily 
detained opposition leaders and that scores of demonstrators have 
been stripped starved and tortured in crowded and filthy prisons 
armed paramilitary squads were reported to have shot and killed 
several protesters and attempted to provoke violence during 
demonstrations while government soldiers stood by but the 
incidents could not be independently verified the londonbased 
group said 
witnesses have identified members of these squads as prominent 
members of the ruling party or security force personnel in civilian 
clothes it said 
amnesty said its findings were sent to noriega in december but 
it has received no response

opposition leader kim daejung stepped 
down today in a last ditch attempt to reunite south koreas 
bitterly divided opposition parties before legislative elections 
next month 
in a separate development president roh taewoo ordered the 
military to stay out of politics and concentrate on defending the 
nation the former army general who was elected president last 
december said the militarys role should be in keeping with 
democratic reforms under way in south korea 
kim resigned as leader of the party for peace and democracy and 
appealed to the rival democratic reunification party to agree to an 
immediate merger 
i have made up my mind to resign in the belief that everything 
must be done to ensure we do not miss the last chance for the 
merger which is our supreme task the veteran leader said in a 
statement 
kim daejung and his supporters seceded from the democratic 
reunification party after the two kims both insisted on running in 
the dec 16 presidential election 
they split the opposition vote and lost to government candidate 
roh who took power feb 25 
kims resignation was announced at a news conference by party 
officials and he was reported to be in seclusion the party for 
peace and democracy said kim was not feeling well 
it was not clear if his resignation would clear the way for 
reunification the rival democratic reunification party discussed 
the resignation at a meeting and announced plans for a second 
meeting friday to consider merging with the party for peace and 
democracy 
but some democratic reunification party officials privately 
expressed distrust and said they feared the resignation was a 
trick some political observers were reluctant to accept kim was 
bowing out of politics 
we are skeptical in view of kim daejungs duplicity in the 
past said a democratic reunification party official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
park youngsook a party for peace and democracy vice president 
who read kims statement became acting party president she 
declined to answer questions about what would happen if the 
opposition merger fails she expressed hope the opposition would 
unite by sunday 
kim has been a major figure in politics for 30 years he helped 
spearhead opposition to the countrys successive authoritarian 
governments and gained international standing as a dissident and 
human rights activist 
the departure of kim daejung follows the resignation last month 
of rival opposition leader kim youngsam 
officials of the party for peace and democracy said they could 
not comment on kim daejungs future political plans in his 
statement kim said he would work for an opposition victory in 
national assembly elections expected to be held april 26 
merger talks between the two parties collapsed last week after 
the democratic reunification party demanded kim daejungs 
resignation 
roh was briefed today on the defense ministrys policies for the 
year 
no one should try to use the military for political purposes 
and the military itself should remain guarded against being used 
politically roh said 
south korea has been plagued by military involvement in politics 
since 1960 when the late president park chunghee then an army 
general staged a coup roh was one of the generals who helped 
expresident chun doohwan seize power with military backing in 
1980

sirens wailed and hundreds of boisterous 
fans jammed the street to cheer susan butcher as she coasted to an 
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1150mile iditarod 
trail sled dog race 
bitterly cold winds raked nome as the flushed and perspiring 
33yearold alaskan cruised beneath the logarch finish at 842 
pm wednesday 
it means a lot to me to win three years in a row said a 
smiling butcher the only musher to win three consecutive 
iditarods as she hugged her frostyfaced lead dogs granite and 
tolstoy 
i very much want four said butcher who has competed in 11 
of the grueling races and earned 30000 for wednesdays victory 
i guess i want five 
although the weather was pretty nasty butcher said this 
morning it was to her advantage because my dogs are good in that 
type of conditions 
butcher who appeared with granite on abctvs good morning 
america said the dog came through with flying colors hes got 
to get a good bone for this one 
butcher finished after 11 days 11 hours and 41 minutes a 
record for the races longer northern route from anchorage to nome 
last year her time of 11 days 2 hours set a record for the 
shorter southern route 
her closest rival martin buser of big lake trailed by 14 hours 
wednesday night 
what gave me the jump on martin was that storm we had last 
night butcher said i knew when i heard we were going to have 
winds that was the best thing that could happen because i knew 
mine would pull through it 
busers team she said had balked in light winds earlier along 
the coast so i knew he couldnt make it through a storm she 
said wind and cold dropped the wind chill to minus 70 degrees 
she said buser battling for second place with fourtime 
iditarod champion rick swenson of two rivers will be a strong 
contender if he races next year 
joe garnie of teller was running fourth wednesday joe 
redington a 70yearold knik resident known as the father of the 
iditarod for helping in 1973 to found the race he has never won 
was fifth 
after the winners take the next 19 finishers will split 
120000 in prize money 
people emptied out of bars and at least one church as butcher 
headed into this old goldmining town a regional hub for western 
alaska whose population roughly doubled in recent days because of 
the race 
butcher has won the iditarod three times finished second twice 
and finished among the top 10 four other times she is the second 
woman to win the iditarod libby riddles of teller won the contest 
in 1985 the year butcher was forced to drop out after an angry 
moose stomped through her team 
the iditarod named after an old supply route to the gold mining 
districts of interior alaska draws its inspiration from a 1925 
relay of diphtheria serum to nome which was hit hard by an 
outbreak of the disease 
the race started march 5 on truckedin snow in downtown 
anchorage and the temperature fluctuated around freezing the next 
few days which strained the coldloving huskies then fresh snow 
slowed the leaders in the alaska range 
redington who has entered all but two of the races 16 
runnings has placed as high as fifth for 400 miles it seemed as 
if he might finally win but he lost the lead to buser on the 
frozen yukon river 
as the race reached the windblown bering sea coast butcher 
quickly caught up she passed buser on tuesday near koyuk 171 
miles from the finish 
five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out the 
remaining teams were strung 500 miles back along the trail and will 
be straggling into nome for a week or more

banned nude models 
bob ash head of the cobb county community services department

by ashs decision the steeple house is fully funded by the county

a supreme court judge today 
granted a fourweek stay of execution for the sharpeville six 
blacks whose scheduled hangings friday prompted a massive 
international clemency campaign 
shortly before the court hearing began a car bomb exploded 
outside a courthouse and police station 25 miles away in 
krugersdorp the blast killed three black men one of them a 
policeman and injured 16 people 
black leaders had warned the hangings might provoke violence 
although there was no immediate evidence linking the blast to the 
sharpeville case 
justice wj human who sentenced the five men and one woman to 
death three years ago said there was evidence that a key 
prosecution witness had perjured himself during the trial 
scores of people in the courtroom almost all black burst into 
applause when human announced his decision several hundred more 
people on the steps outside cheered raised clenched fists and sang 
freedom songs when they heard the news 
the six were convicted of complicity in the 1984 mob murder of a 
black town councilor during antiapartheid riots even though there 
was no direct evidence they directly contributed to the victims 
death government leaders churches and human rights groups around 
the world appealed for clemency 
the judge based his decision on a defense application 
questioning the reliability of testimony by prosecution witness 
joseph manete human cited a may 11 1985 statement in which manete 
said he had been forced by police to identify two of the accused as 
having been at the scene 
human said he was never made aware of that statement and 
therefore did not allow the defense to crossexamine manete on 
that point 
if manetes statement had been available i would have allowed 
crossexamination human said 
he granted the defense until april 18 to prepare an application 
for a retrial for all six defendants 
president pw botha told black anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
in a meeting wednesday night he would not intervene in the case he 
said the only way the six could be reprieved was if human ruled 
there was significant new evidence 
tutu was outside pretoria supreme court today with relatives of 
the convicted 
both the trial court and the appeal court found no evidence that 
the sharpeville six committed the murder 
they were convicted in a nonjury trial by white judges under 
the doctrine of common cause which holds they were responsible 
for the sept 3 1984 death of sharpeville deputy mayor jacob 
dlamini because they were found to be part of a mob of 100 people 
who stoned and burned him to death 
in durban and cape town protesters demonstrated at us and 
british diplomatic missions urging stronger pressure by those 
countries to avert the hangings 
cape town police arrested 21 white women from the black sash 
civil rights group who were demonstrating on behalf of the 
condemned prisoners in violation of a law barring protests near 
parliament 
at johannesburgs university of the witwatersrand two cameramen 
for the visnews television agency were detained while filming a 
protest against the hangings by about 1000 students 
the governments information ministry held simultaneous news 
conferences in pretoria and cape town showing reporters videotapes 
of similar mob killings and issuing a ninepage background report 
on the case 
referring to worldwide appeals for clemency dave steward 
director of the bureau for information told reporters in pretoria 
some of the requests came from leaders of countries for which 
south africa has the highest regard 
there was a great temptation to intervene for humanitarian and 
political reasons however the responsibility of the state 
transcends those reasons he added 
in cape town deputy minister of information stoffel van der 
merwe said the government is ignoring political pressure in 
order to treat each case absolutely on its inherent merits 
steward told reporters that since antiapartheid violence and 
protests began in 1984 with the sharpeville riots in which dlamini 
was killed 706 black south africans had been burned to death 
no emergency meetings of the united nations security council 
have been held regarding the hundreds who have been killed by mob 
violence said steward adding there had been no international 
expressions of sympathy for dlamini 
president reagan and the leaders of great britain france 
italy west germany the european community the united nations and 
many international and domestic religious labor and political 
groups have called on botha to grant clemency the governments of 
japan and greece today announced they too asked south africa to 
reconsider its decision

firefighters union 1157 
if nothing else it was a good learning experience lt 
cecil cornish president of international association of 
firefighters local 2445 said wednesday of the unions 57850 
share 
the union filed a grievance after frank neeld vice president of 
the local left his glasses on the seat sept 19 the next day 
firefighter timothy gutman sat on them as he climbed behind the 
wheel 
neeld demanded reimbursement under a contract clause calling for 
repair or replacement of glasses damaged or destroyed in the line 
of duty 
leaving glasses on the seat of a firetruck where anyone could 
have reason to drive it was negligent contended city manager 
randall reid and being on duty or at work was not what the 
contract intended by in the line of duty 
arbitrator ja raffaele of philadelphia sided with the city in 
a march 13 ruling on the grievance the dignity of a 
collectivebargaining agreement he wrote should not be 
compromised by an interpretation that reduces its meaning to

defense secretary frank c carlucci 
said he and his soviet counterpart briefly debated the reported 
nicaraguan incursion into honduras today before concluding three 
days of talks on an upbeat note 
carlucci said he protested the incursion to soviet defense 
minister dmitri yazov who made some attempt to defend the 
sandinista action 
i would not characterize it as a vigorous defense carlucci 
told a news conference before leaving bern for washington 
carlucci said he consulted with the white house overnight and 
endorsed the decision to send an emergency us force to honduras 
on exercises 
the sandinistas said they had chased contra rebels to the 
honduran border but the nicaraguan defense ministry denied 
sandinista troops entered honduras 
the soviet union provides nicaragua with military and economic 
aid at a news conference yazov did not address the issue of 
nicaragua specifically 
we spoke out in favor of greater predictability and stability 
in the sovietus military balance he said we tried to 
better understand the logic of and rationale for us actions in 
the military field 
carlucci described his talks with yazov which were closed to 
reporters as cordial and businesslike and said he had been 
invited to moscow to continue the discussions at an unspecified 
date 
he said he had not obtained the apology he requested for the 
fatal shooting by a soviet soldier of us army maj arthur 
nicholson in east germany three years ago yazov said the incident 
occurred before he became defense minister last may said carlucci 
he said he would undertake to investigate it through the 
soviet foreign ministry which has been handling the issue carlucci 
said 
to avoid such dangerous activities carlucci said gen 
yazov and i agreed that more would be done in this area 
both agreed that there is no need for shooting said 
carlucci gen yazov was firm on that 
carlucci said the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
adm william crowe and the soviet chief of staff marshal sergei 
akhomeyev would meet soon probably in washington to work out 
guidelines to prevent friction between us and soviet ground air 
and sea forces 
yazov repeated kremlin assurances that soviet troops would be 
withdrawn from afghanistan but was unable to set a timetable 
pending the outcome of stalled peace talks in geneva said carlucci 
the two sides also discussed spacebased missile defense 
negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals and regional 
conflicts including angola cambodia and korea he said 
the soviets proposed an experiment of a new method of 
determining the presence of nucleartipped sealaunched cruise 
missiles aboard vessels a technique mentioned last december by 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev but never explained to the west 
carlucci expressed doubt about the technique but said the 
united states was willing to review the propsed experiment details 
of which were not available 
the soviets want to impose a limit on such weapons as part of 
the strategic arms reduction treaty now under negotiation

congressional republicans who investigated the 
irancontra affair today criticized the indictments of two former 
white house officials and two other men but democrats said the 
charges buttress last years findings 
i personally think that the indictment counts are pathetic 
said sen orrin hatch rutah on abctvs good morning america 
you have in this particular case 30 fulltime lawyers 50 
investigators millions of dollars being spent by the government 
an overwhelming onslaught of legalities here said hatch one of 
the reagan administrations strongest supporters during last 
summers hearings 
rep richard cheney rwyo said on the nbctv today 
program i dont think that men like poindexter and north 
deserve to end up being prosecuted on criminal grounds that deal 
with their service in government im not sure the indictments 
are warranted but im sure at this point probably the only way to 
resolve it is to go forward with the trials 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house irancontra 
committee who also appeared on abc said the charges are similar 
to the conclusions reached by the legislative panels although the 
committees didnt apportion criminal blame 
when we set out there were a number of laws that we thought 
had been broken the indictments track these findings in our 
report very carefully said hamilton 
these are very serious offenses said another democrat from 
the senate panel sen george mitchell of maine on nbc 
i think it should be noted that the prosecutor lawrence 
walsh is a lifelong republican a former deputy attorney general 
in a republican administration appointed to the court by a 
republican president so there are no political implications in the 
prosecution said mitchell 
rep henry hyde rill an administration supporter on the 
irancontra panel said earlier this is only the beginning of 
what will be a very long legal process that will question the 
sufficiency of the indictments and the constitutionality of the 
laws 
he said the indictments are premised on some assumptions that 
may or may not be true like title to the money the prosecutors 
believe the money from the sale of weapons to iran belonged to the 
us treasury and therefore it was misappropriated for the contras 
but i think a very good argument can be made that the proceeds of 
the sale dont belong to the treasury 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate committee 
said i personally remain convinced that they the four men 
exhibited insufficient sensitivity to the rule of law and to the 
fact that under our system of government the congress must make the 
laws 
but he added that we must await the verdict of a jury of their 
peers as to whether this insensitivity was criminal in nature 
sen james mcclure ridaho another administration defender 
during the hearings noted that the white house was charging that 
nicaraguan troops had entered neighboring honduras to battle the 
contras 
its ironic that on a day when indictments were handed down in 
washington against the very people who tried desperately to keep 
the freedom fighters alive sandinista troops were in honduras 
trying to wipe out the freedom fighters once and for all mcclure 
said 
rep richard gephardt dmo a candidate for the democratic 
presidential nomination said whatever the outcome of these 
prosecutions i think the special prosecutor has given as fresh 
evidence that the reagan administration generally has put the 
constitution of the united states through the shredder 
this will be an important issue in the campaign gephardt 
said particularly the role of vice president george bush who is 
the frontrunner for the republican presidential nomination

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
was introduced today to the communist easts doorway to europe 
an industrial region in northern yugoslavia that has realized his 
dream of joining the world trading community 
gorbachev received a less enthusiastic welcome here than he did 
in belgrade where he spent the first three days of his fiveday 
tour of yugoslavia 
more than 1000 people gathered in ljubljanas revolution 
square but the soviet leader and his wife raisa were greeted 
with only polite applause cheering shouting crowds welcomed the 
gorbachevs to belgrade 
belgrade is the center of yugoslavias serbian republic which 
traditionally has had closes ties to moscow 
at an electronics plant in slovenia yugoslavias northernmost 
republic and one of the most prosperous regions in the communist 
world premier dusan sinigoj told gorbachev his semiautonomous 
republic is bound to the west both culturally and economically and 
now concentrates on developing new technologies for export 
slovenia represents a doorway to western europe selling 
more than half the goods it produces abroad he told the soviet 
leader slovenia has only 8 percent of yugoslavias population but 
produces 25 percent of the nations exports 
the soviet union is slovenias secondlargest trading partner 
behind west germany 
unders gorbachevs program of perestroika or restructuring 
the soviet union is trying to encourage joint ventures with western 
firms hoping to produce more goods for export and improve trade 
with hardcurrency countries 
gorbachev responded in good nature to criticism about his 
restructuring plan 
franc sifkovic general director of the iskra avtomatika plant 
that gorbachev was visiting complained that decentralization undur 
perestroika had complicated the firms dealings with the soviet 
union now he said iskra must deal with individual managers 
instead of with a single government ministry as in the past 
then restructure yourself the soviet leader said with a 
smile 
during a tour of one branch of iskra the largest electronics 
and appliance enterprise in yugoslavia gorbachev was shown 
equipment made for export to the soviet union and was introducud to 
the research and development division of the plant 
keeping up with western technology and developing improved 
stateoftheart equipment is central to iskras business strategy 
and is what gorbachev hopes for soviet enterprises 
if gorbachev was impressed with the advanced products and 
methods he gave little indication publicly his remarks were 
confined to expressions of friendship and a desire for improved 
sovietyugoslav relations 
yugoslavia has a 14 billion trade surplus with the soviet 
union but has beun unwilling to accept soviet manufactured goods in 
compensation for the debt officials here say soviet products 
notorious for poor quality wont sell in yugoslavia 
although the average wage in slovenia is about 500000 dinars 
or 365 a month nearly twice that of yugoslavia as a whole 
gorbachevs motorcade passed a shantytown near the iskra plan that 
illustrated the nations economic crisis 
yugoslavias runaway inflation is pegged at 170 percent a year 
and 15 percent of the countrys workforce is jobless 
western influence is apparent in slovenia shops which sell a 
variety of west european products from flashlight batteries to 
automobiles slovenia borders both austria and italy and yugoslavs 
unlike soviets and most other east europeans may travel freely 
abroad 
slovenians living along the border often do their shopping in 
austrian and italian stores and many work in austria 
the republic industrialized rapidly after world war ii and 
benefitted by being able to obtamn raw materials cheaply in 
yugoslavia and export manufactured goods to world markets

part of their nations history 21 irancontra grand jurors became 
the stars in an unusual media show 
since grand jurors deliberate in secret they rarely have to 
contend with dozens of reporters outside their meeting room but 
wednesday was different 
before the jurors arrived at the federal courthouse rumors had 
spread through washingtons press corps that indictments were 
imminent against the major players in the irancontra affair 
when independent counsel lawrence e walsh entered the building 
in the morning he told reporters to stick around that was all 
they needed to hear the vigil was on 
dozens of reporters gathered behind rope barriers outside the 
normally quiet hallway used by the jurors 
reporters didnt know the jurors names but studied their faces 
each time they emerged for a break straining for signs that 14 
months of grueling work had ended 
this is it someone would yell from the sometimes noisy 
press area setting off a false alarm 
during six hours of onandoff deliberations walsh and his 
prosecutors repeatedly entered and left the jury room setting off 
new speculation that it was over 
by late morning walsh told reporters these things can take a 
long time he didnt say what the things were he didnt have 
to 
then walsh was called down to the grand jury at 354 pm est 
the jurors filed out and their deadly serious faces sent reporters 
dashing to a fourth floor courtroom 
twelve minutes later the grand jurors and walsh were seated in 
the courtoom and in came federal magistrate jean dwyer 
your honor this is grand jury 874 empaneled jan 28 
1987 courtroom clerk maureen lawrie said 
after the grand jury was polled ms lawrie said mr foreman

indictment to the clerk 
the indictment was not read aloud 
dwyer thanked the jurors for their service and reporters ran 
from the room like a thundering herd 
the jurors left quietly thankful presumably that their long 
ordeal was over

the federal deposit insurance corp today 
advanced 1 billion to banks owned by first republicbank corp a 
dallas holding company in a rescue package that could ultimately 
rival the governments largest bank bailout 
fdic chairman l william seidman called the assistance an 
interim step to provide needed stability to first republics 
subsidiaries and depositors 
seidman said his agency which insures deposits at commercial 
banks would guarantee all of the subsidiary banks deposits as 
well as money owed to general creditors of the banks creditors of 
the holding company are not protected by this arrangement he said 
the action goes beyond the minimum the agency would normally be 
expected to back up which is deposits of 100000 and less 
first republicbank is the 13th largest in the nation with 332 
billion in assets and 73 subsidiary banks the holding company 
reported a loss of 656 million last year 
first republicbank acknowledged tuesday it had been forced to 
seek federal aid because of a deteriorating loan portfolio and 
difficulty in raising deposits 
a first republicbank spokesman said wednesday the bank had 
experienced a runoff of deposits the day before but that the 
situation apparently had stabilized an earlier drain of deposits 
and customer defections had forced it to begin preliminary 
discussions with the fdic the spokesman said 
seidman said the fdic was seeking a longterm solution to the 
holding companys problems and was talking to private investors who 
may want to participate in a restructuring of the company 
he declined to be more specific but in past transactions the 
agency has provided insurance money in conjunction with an infusion 
of funds from private investment groups 
the largestever bank rescue was the 45 billion rescue in 1984 
of continental illinois national bank amp trust of chicago the fdic 
expects to recoup much of its initial outlay in that bailout and 
expects its ultimate cost to be about 17 billion 
seidman said he could not say what the eventual cost of the 
first republic rescue would be however he noted that first 
republic and continental are about the same size 
he said that unlike the case with first continental a failure 
attributed to mismanagement its very clear the primary reason 
for this problem is the economy of texas 
seidman said the fdic will assume some control of the subsidiary 
banks operations although not day to day he said the current 
banks management will remain in place for now but said changes 
could be discussed later 
sen phil gramm rtexas who appeared at a news conference with 
seidman said that despite a record number of bank failures the 
texas economy is on the mend we feel were in the backwash of a 
tidal wave that hit the texas economy about two years ago with the 
collapse of oil prices the basic economic future looks bright 
when compared to the recent past 
the 1 billion advance is in the form of a sixmonth note from 
the fdic 
the subsidiary banks are pledging their stock as collateral for 
the infusion and the parent company is guaranteeing it 
the collateral is being pledged by 29 of the subsidiary banks 
representing about 80 percent of the holding companys assets 
the largest subsidiary is first republicbankdallas with 195 
billion in assets 
federal reserve board member manuel johnson who also appeared 
at the news conference said first republic has been borrowing at 
the federal reserves discount window for the past several days he 
refused to say how much the bank had borrowed but did say the bank 
had pledged its loans and other assets to back up its borrowings 
the fdic reported a postdepression record of 184 bank failures 
last year more than half in the oilrich states of texas 
louisiana and oklahoma 
so far this year 38 commercial banks have failed nationally 
the first republic aid would not have a significant impact on 
the fund seidman said the fdics insurance fund finished 1987 
with 183 billion up slightly from the end of 1986 despite the 
failures

the beleaguered government announced 
today it was taking over all public services a day after a failed 
coup attempt by rebel officers sparked antigovernment rioting by 
thousands of people 
soldiers loyal to military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
patrolled the streets after wednesdays rampage by people fed up 
with military rule and panamas financial crisis 
the disturbances were the largest since civilian opponents began 
staging demonstrations calling for noriegas ouster last summer 
dressed in battle gear and armed with shotguns sidearms tear 
gas cannisters and rubber truncheons the soldiers were spread 
throughout the city and were on every corner in many areas 
the coup attempt wednesday was led by panamas police chief 
col leonidas macias but was quickly crushed 
the united states has been using economic and political pressure 
to try to force noriega to step down as military leader and leave 
the country as head of the 15000member panama defense forces 
noriega is the power behind the civilian government 
the government decree covered electric service communications 
ports water services airports hospitals and the farm and dairy 
products marketing institute 
the decree said defense forces were instructed to cooperate 
with the government agencies and insure that public order is 
maintained 
electric power shut off by striking workers wednesday was 
restored early today but then went off again 
wednesdays protests erupted spontaneously throughout the 
capital and in the countrys second largest city colon 50 miles 
to the north 
security guards fired into crowds that ransacked stores and lit 
barricades of trash on fire in panama city but no deaths were 
reported 
by midafternoon the demonstrators were dispersed buses and 
taxis stopped running and the city was virtually deserted except 
for patrolling soldiers 
the attempted coup was the first indication of opposition to 
noriega within the panama defense forces 
the coup attempt began an hour after dawn with the crackle of 
light arms fire inside the walled defense forces headquarters in 
the capital 
after eight hours of official silence the defense forces 
finally acknowledged at midafternoon that a coup attempt had taken 
place blaming a handful of officers led by macias 
a statement from the defense forces press office said macias 
three majors and a captain were arrested and that the revolt was 
put down without bloodshed 
but maj edgardo lopez head of the military press office told 
reporters that eight or 10 officers were involved in the 
aborted coup he did not explain the discrepancy 
an hour after the shooting began noriega appeared at the top of 
a stairway outside the headquarters building dressed in civilian 
clothes and accompanied by members of his high command 
to shouted questions from reporters about what had happened the 
general replied what has happened is that you are visiting us 
here today 
asked about the shots he replied they were kisses 
despite official evasions word of the coup attempt spread and 
people poured into streets of the capital that were strangely 
devoid of riot police and soldiers 
demonstrators erected flaming barricades of trash and debris 
across hundreds of streets roughed up suspected government 
informers and broke into stores believed to be owned by noriega and 
his supporters 
in the central business district a mob of hundreds pushed a 
parked car through the plateglass windows of a store they believed 
is owned by noriega then set the vehicle ablaze 
security guards fired on the crowd from the buildings upper 
windows but no one was injured flames destroyed the store 
by midday unpaid workers at the stateowned utility joined 
strikes called earlier by teachers health department and other 
government employees the entire nation was left without 
electricity 
noriega was indicted last month by two federal grand juries in 
florida on drug trafficking charges that link him to colombias 
infamous medellin drug cartel spain formally offered him asylum 
banks remained closed by government order for the 12th straight 
day on wednesday most had closed days earlier because of a run on 
deposits and the governments inability to provide them with cash 
to cover withdrawals 
the bank run began feb 26 when the noriegadominated 
legislative assembly dismissed the nations civilian figurehead 
president eric arturo delvalle the day before devalle had 
ordered noriega to resign 
the united states has halted all military and economic aid to 
panama and withheld 65 million in panama canal fees due this week

a republican senator predicted today that the 
senate would override president reagans veto of a sweeping 
antidiscrimination bill and said the administration has only 
itself to blame 
sen john mccain rariz said the white house should have 
proposed a compromise while the civil rights restoration act was in 
the hearing process or on the floor not after both chambers had 
passed it by overwhelming margins 
reagan offered a less sweeping alternative to the bill wednesday 
along with his veto 
but mccain said its chances of success were very poor its 
very tough around here to switch your vote its very very 
difficult to ask people to take new positions when this whole issue 
has been percolating for four years 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said he was hoping 
for a vote on overriding the veto today but he said he had been 
hearing reports that the opposition strategy involved a long 
debate 
civil rights leaders called the veto one more entry in a dismal 
civil rights record and said congress will prevail as it has before 
in the last seven years 
this administration is compiling the worst civil rights record 
of any administration in half a century officials of the 
200group leadership conference on civil rights said in a statement 
wednesday 
this will hurt mr bush more than anybody else said rep 
augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education and 
labor committee referring to vice president george bushs 
presidential candidacy 
both the senate and the house passed the civil rights 
restoration act by huge margins that were expected to hold up 
during override votes in the senate and the house which is 
scheduled to take up the matter tuesday a twothirds majority is 
needed to override 
president reagan may want to turn the clock back on civil 
rights but the american people do not said house speaker jim 
wright dtexas 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and 
human resources committee said congress has repeatedly thwarted 
administration officials attempts to change the nations civil 
rights course 
he accused justice department officials including attorney 
general edwin meese iii of distorting the meaning of the bill 
pandering to the republican right and engaging in an unseemly 
effort to escalate their longstanding anticivil rights vendetta 
the restoration act is also known as the grove city bill for the 
pennsylvania college involved in the supreme court case that 
started the controversy 
the 1984 decision said only specific programs or activities 
receiving federal aid must comply with the antidiscrimination 
statutes that meant discrimination could continue in a schools 
athletic department for example if only the english department 
received federal money 
the new bill would require institutionwide compliance with 
civil rights laws by educational institutions state and local 
government agencies and many corporations if any part received 
federal aid it applies to discrimination against women 
minorities the aged and the disabled 
the house passed the grove city bill 31598 on march 2 the 
senate passed it 7514 on jan 28 
supporters of the bill said congress had always intended wide 
protections in order to make sure taxpayers dont end up 
subsidizing discrimination 
but reagan said the bill would vastly and unjustifiably extend 
the power of the federal government over the decisions and affairs 
of private organizations such as churches and synagogues farms 
businesses and state and local governments 
the moral majority mounted a lastminute effort to win enough 
support to block a veto override the group said wednesday it had 
sent a letter and a 40page legal memo to the district offices of 
all house members this week echoing reagans views on the bill 
in a message last week to tens of thousands of pastors the 
moral majority said failure to obey this perverted law could 
result in lawsuits costing millions of dollars being brought 
against our churches by militant gays feminists and others who 
have no respect for gods laws

studios march 7 over residuals from foreign distribution creative 
control and a management proposal to restructure residuals for 
onehour television shows sold into syndication no new talks are

season of some top television series including nbcs la law 
the cosby show and cheers and abcs moonlighting

cliffhanger endings designed to draw viewers back for newseason 
debuts 
moonlighting star cybill shepherd told the paper the show

armenians stayed away from work and school for a 
second day today in a disputed region of azerbaijan an armenian 
official said 
an official radio report said the mayor was fired in in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait where government officials said 32 
people were killed in ethnic rioting last month 
the actions stem from a dispute over whether the 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan should be annexed to 
neighboring armenia the region north of iran and east of turkey 
has a large armenian population 
armenians touched off a wave of unrest to press that demand on 
feb 13 in nagornokarabakhs main city stepanakert protests 
spread to armenias capital yerevan and led to violence in at 
least two cities in azerbaijan 
gamlet kocharyan an industrial worker and member of the 
governing council of the armenian city of kafar said workers 
struck for a second day in stepanakert to demand annexation to 
armenia factories and schools were closed because of the strike 
and 40000 people demonstrated outside communist party offices he 
said 
kocharyan said he received the information from armenian 
activists in stepanakert he spoke in a telephone interview 
the report could not be confirmed because the government has 
barred western journalists from traveling to the region and 
telephone calls to officials of the area were cut off 
the official media in moscow did not report the strike and 
representatives of the azerbaijani government in moscow said they 
had no information about the matter 
baku radio the mouthpiece of the government in the azerbaijani 
capital reported that the mayor of sumgait had been fired by the 
ruling council 
the station monitored by the british broadcasting corp in 
london said tavakkula yagub ogly mamedov was relieved of his 
duties for serious shortcomings in the work of maintaining 
appropriate law and order and discipline in the city and for the 
lack of political foresight he has shown which has resulted in 
tragic consequences 
government spokesmen have said 32 people were killed in rioting 
in sumgait on feb 28 by young hooligans provoked by ethnic 
unrest elsewhere armenian activists say the victims were armenians 
killed by ethnic azeris the dominant group in azerbaijan that is 
mostly shiite moslem armenians are predominantly christian 
the regional party committee of nagornokarabakh scheduled a 
meeting thursday at which the annexation demand was expected to be 
discussed kocharyan said

mourners wearing shamrocks and 
green armbands today streamed through the streets of belfast in a 
funeral procession for a slain ira guerrilla 
the irish republican army appealed for calm during the funeral 
for 33year kevin mccracken who was buried a day after gunmen 
killed three people and wounded 68 at another ira funeral 
mccracken was shot to death monday by a british army patrol that 
he fired upon 
mourners followed the coffin through west belfast to the roman 
catholic milltown cemetery the scene of wednesdays attack by 
protestant gunmen 
ira gunmen in their traditional salute to their movements 
dead fired three volleys of gunfire in a side street near 
mccrackens home they lined up on a sidewalk next to a photograph 
of mccracken which was surrounded by wreaths 
britain attacked us yesterday let britain take a lesson 
from our presence here today you can never defeat us jim 
mcallister a leading member of the iras political wing sinn 
fein said at the graveside 
the funeral passed quietly the outlawed ira had advised police 
earlier to stay away and they did 
during the night rioters enraged by wednesdays cemetery attack 
firebombed five houses in protestant north belfast and burned 
buses one woman was treated for smoke inhalation but there were 
no other injuries reported 
the attack occurred during a funeral for three ira guerrillas 
who were shot by british commandos in gibraltar on march 6 they 
were unarmed and allegedly planning a bombing attack 
police said they were holding a protestant michael stone who 
allegedly mounted the cemetery attack and an accomplice police 
gave no other details on the two who can be held without charge 
for seven days 
police kept out of sight as more than 1000 mourners followed 
mccrackens coffin draped with the irish flag from his familys 
twostory rowhouse to the nearby holy trinity church for a mass 
stewards from sinn fein removed mccrackens black beret and 
gloves from the coffin before it entered the church 
black flags adorned the windows of homes along the route of the 
slow procession headed by a piper playing a lament 
relative calm returned to this britishruled province in time 
for mccrackens funeral 
overnight police said catholic gangs stole 24 vehicles in 
belfast and two in londonderry setting many of them ablaze they 
said rioters bombarded security forces with gasoline bombs rocks 
and bottles filled with acid 
in belfast police fired plastic bullets to disperse the rioters 
there were no injuries reported 
mainstream protestant organizations disavowed the cemetery 
attack the rev ian paisley hardline leader of the protestant 
democratic unionist party said wednesday that all rightthinking 
protestants would condemn it 
the british broadcasting corp said an anonymous caller 
telephoned its belfast office and claimed responsibility for the 
attack on behalf of a littleknown extremist faction the 
protestant action force the bbc said the caller gave no code word 
establishing authenticity 
the group has claimed responsibility for previous sectarian 
assassinations 
belfast city councilman brian feeney of the moderate catholic 
social democratic and labor party predicted in a bbc radio 
interview today that the funeral attack could trigger fierce new 
sectarian strife in the province 
it was a dreadful provocation for the irish nationalist 
community people who support the ira will be asking that there 
should be some retaliation he said 
authorities said 16 of the 68 people injured in the funeral 
attack remained hospitalized today one was in critical condition 
with severe head injuries and four others were seriously wounded 
the british government called the attack insane and depraved 
and appealed for calm so did sinn fein 
the gunman could have been emboldened by the deliberate absence 
of police at the funerals of mairead farrell 31 daniel mccann 
30 and sean savage 24 
the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force said 
it had agreed to appeals by the families to keep away after the 
catholic church assured it there would be no graveside military 
displays by the ira 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to drive the british from 
northern ireland and unite the province with the maily catholic 
irish republic

armed with 1 million for a statewide 
media campaign and a beefedup staff manning banks of tollfree 
telephone lines the state will begin reuniting people with money 
left in dormant bank accounts 
the final legal hurdle in a 47 million bank of america 
settlement was cleared wednesday when superior court judge a 
richard backus approved an agreement worked out with the state 
controllers office 
backus effectively ended the 13year fight over bank of america 
accounts improperly charged and in some cases totally wiped out 
by service fees levied on dormant savings accounts he ordered that 
nearly 1 million be used for controller office staffing increases 
to handle the added work load 
controller gray davis must now try and find what may be millions 
of people whose inactive accounts were turned over to him under the 
states unclaimed property law and return the money to them or 
their heirs 
this is the biggest reunification project that we have ever 
undertaken and probably the biggest one in the united states 
said d robert shuman chief counsel to davis 
in 1975 thenstate controller ken cory sued bank of america and 
other banks contending they had no legal right to levy service 
charges on dormant accounts or to fail to credit the accounts with 
interest 
levying service charges on inactive accounts has been outlawed 
since 1976 unless financial institutions give customers advance 
warning 
under the 1959 unclaimed property law financial institutions 
must search for customers whose accounts have been dormant for 
seven years if they cannot locate them the contents are turned 
over to the controller who also must make a search 
backus ordered the controllers office to mount an aggressive 
outreach effort including the hiring of the los angeles public 
relations firm of rogers and associates to publicize the payback 
operation 
to get the word out to bank customers the controllers office 
will buy television advertising and announce the program in radio 
and television public service spots shuman said

the copilot of a commuter aircraft that crashed 
near durango in january killing nine people had a history of 
alcohol abuse dating back to 1972 according to court records 
ralph darrell harvey who was killed in the crash had been 
convicted twice of drunkendriving offenses according to arapahoe 
county criminal files 
harvey 42 was considered a problem drinker and had been 
ordered to attend two alcohol education and therapy programs said 
john toplenicky chief deputy arapahoe district attorney 
the continental express plane crashed jan 19 near durango 350 
miles southwest of denver killing both pilots and seven 
passengers eight passengers survived 
the backgrounds of the pilots have been under scrutiny since the 
national transportation safety board disclosed finding traces of 
cocaine in the body of the pilot stephen s silver 36 last week 
authorities said silver had used cocaine within 24 hours of the 
crash but the ntsb does not know which pilot was flying the plane 
or why it crashed 
faa documents obtained wednesday also showed silver did not 
report convictions of eight traffic infractions he had in the four 
years before the crash federal law requires such disclosure the 
traffic violations would not necessarily result in faa sanctions 
but failure to disclose them could result in revocation of a 
pilots license officials said 
harvey had reported at least one drunk driving conviction to the 
faa 
tom byrne an attorney representing transcolorado airlines 
declined comment on harveys record 
transcolorado based in colorado springs employed the crew and 
leased the plane to rocky mountain airways a continental 
subsidiary that flies under the name of continental express 
byrne said he did not know if the airlines knew of the pilots 
background when harvey was hired a few months before the crash

lt col oliver norths former secretary 
fawn hall said charges against the marine and others in the 
irancontra scandal are no surprise as she defended him in a 
speech to a university audience 
ms hall conceded mistakes were made in the sale of arms to iran 
and distribution of some of the proceeds to the contras in 
nicaragua but she added wednesday you have to look at the 
intention i think lieutenant colonel oliver norths intentions 
were good 
the federal grand jury indictment was something that we have 
expected for some time she told about 300 people at the 
university of puget sound the mostly supportive crowd listened 
over the chants of 30 to 40 protesters outside carrying signs with 
messages such as fawn go home 
ms hall was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
her testimony before the grand jury investigating the case 
the issue is still quite emotional for me especially today 
she said there are a lot of questions that i wont be able to 
answer tonight because there is a pending investigation going on 
when a woman in the audience asked whether ms hall believed two 
wrongs made a right ms hall raised her voice and replied 
thats not what i said 
she blamed the news media and congress for what she said were 
distortions including sexual innuendoes repeated by our members 
of congress on her role in removing documents from her office 
the irancontra hearings were a circus she said the 
hearings could be considered a cleansing process to see where the 
policy went wrong but there were many members of congress who 
wanted this to be another watergate and get their names in 
history

a group of 10 journalists was hurriedly 
assembled late wednesday night to accompany american soldiers 
ordered to honduras by president reagan the pentagon said today 
the group of reporters activated under what is known as the 
department of defense national media pool departed andrews air 
force base md outside washington at 345 am est the pentagon 
said 
the reporters were then flown to fort bragg nc the home of 
the 82nd airborne and joined the first battalion from that 
division to depart for honduras at 7 am the pentagon added in a 
statement 
the pool deployment began at 11 pm last night with the 
notification of the bureau chiefs and initial pool reports are 
expected to arrive at the pentagon later today the statement 
said 
president reagan ordered four army battalions to honduras on a 
nonotice emergency readiness exercise wednesday night in what 
the white house called a measured response to the presence of 
nicaraguan troops inside honduras 
pentagon sources have said the nicaraguans crossed the honduras 
border in an attempt to destroy some large contra guerrilla supply 
camps fighting was said to be continuing this morning 
according to the white house the us troops will not be 
committed to combat but rather will conduct some routine exercises 
while underscoring the american commitment to the region and 
deterring further nicaraguan attacks 
the national media pool was created in the wake of the 1983 
invasion of grenada from which all american reporters were 
excluded by the defense department the pentagon and press 
ultimately agreed to set up procedures whereby a small group of 
reporters could be scrambled in secret to accompany us military 
units as they deployed in the future 
before today the media pool had been called out for six test 
exercises and one operational deployment the deployment involved 
coverage of the first us navy convoy operation in the persian 
gulf last july 
while the sending of troops to honduras was not conducted under 
military secrecy the pentagon said the national media pool was 
activated because it offered an excellent mechanism to provide 
coverage of this type of shortnotice exercise 
the pool concept has been employed seven times and has proven 
to be effective the pentagon added in its statement 
the pentagon identified the 10 individuals assembled for the 
pool as steven komarow of the associated press douglas allmond

house speaker jim wright today called a reagan 
administration decision to send troops to honduras unjustified as 
lawmakers expressed skepticism about whether a reported nicaraguan 
military incursion is as large or as threatening as the white house 
claims 
i know nothing that justifies sending troops wright said 
adding that the move was potentially dangerous he said he 
hoped the troops would be kept well away from any fighting 
sen alan dixon dill emerging from a classified briefing on 
the situation said lawmakers were assured that were not going 
to be involved down there thats the pledge given me he said 
there had clearly been a penetration into honduras by 
sandinista troops who were not in hot pursuit of contras but he 
said he opposed the sending of more us troops to the area 
senate majority leader robert byrd called president reagans 
decision to send 3200 us troops to honduras an overreaction 
and a number of other legislators said they were still waiting for 
hard evidence from the white house to back up its claims 
weve heard the administration cry wolf wolf before 
byrd dwva told reporters i dont know when theyre crying 
wolf byrd said that even by midmorning today he had neither 
been briefed nor contacted by the administration about the troop 
movement 
i hope it does not prove to be counterproductive and does 
not derail the peace process byrd said 
rep edward markey dmass said the white house has been 
playing politics with american aid they have been playing politics 
with the contras and now they are playing politics with american 
boys 
sen john mccain rariz generally a supporter of the 
administrations central america policies said he was skeptical 
about the need for sending troops 
he said the sandinista incursion into honduras represented a 
cynical abandonment of the peace process but added that it does 
not pose any serious threat to the united states and therefore did 
not clearly call for the sending of military forces 
i think its a move the president may come to regret because 
the spectacle of american troops moving into central america in 
convoy flying down there i think is going to remind the american 
people of why they dont want this said sen john kerry 
dmass interviewed on nbc television 
sen richard lugar rind a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee said the incident highlighted the need for new 
aid for the rebels which has been twice rejected by congress this 
year he said only renewed aid will keep a regional peace process 
going 
the plan only works if the contras have some assistance 
and therefore there is some reason for the sandinistas to deal with 
them lugar said in an interview on abc i think its very 
important that things get back to the table and i hope our policies 
will lead to that 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said i think you 
have to ask the question of whether 1200 nicaraguans going across 
the honduran border is a threat to us national security as 
secretary of state george p shultz had argued in a briefing 
wednesday for congressional leaders 
in announcing reagans decision late wednesday night white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thousands of sandinista 
troops had entered honduras and the honduran government had 
appealed for help he said that for the time being the us troops 
would remain about 125 miles from the area of hostilities 
some lawmakers noted that reagan is making a renewed push for 
contra aid and recalled a similar situation two years ago when 
nicaraguan troops went into border areas of honduras two days after 
a house vote against aid to the contras and just before a senate 
vote 
they have cried wolf so many times even supporters of 
contra aid are somewhat skeptical said sen patrick leahy dvt 
it is apparently a major raid on a contra camp in the jungles 
now that does not pose a threat to honduras or its capital 
in the 1986 episode president reagan claimed that 1500 troops 
had gone across the border and used his emergency power to give 
honduras 20 million in military aid other us officials later 
put the number of troops at closer to 800 and it appeared that 
honduras had to be pressed to accept the emergency aid 
this is not the first time the president has made use of his 
military authority after he lost a vote on the contras rep 
edward j markey dmass said wednesday night president 
reagans decision to send the 82nd airborne to honduras has more to 
do with politics than with american security 
but assistant secretary of state elliott abrams appearing on 
abctvs nightline program held to the administration position 
that the sandinistas were trying to deliver a death blow to the 
contras who use honduras as a haven he said the administration 
would document the seriousness of the sandinista threat in material 
submitted to congress today 
some republicans needed no convincing rep jack fields 
rtexas said i dont think the president really had an 
alternative to sending in us forces 
the purpose is for them to demonstrate our commitment to 
regional peace and stability fields said 
but byrd said the administration was going too far 
its an overreaction he said the sandinistas have 
crossed over the border before and gone back 
and jason isaacson a spokesman for sen christopher dodd 
dconn said the senator saw the administration action as an 
effort to divert attention from the irancontra indictments and 
to turn up the heat on congress for more aid to the contras 
congressional leaders briefed wednesday by top administration 
officials on the crossborder fighting had said the white house 
offered no proof that us interests were threatened or that the 
contras were on the verge of being wiped out 
the officials shultz white house chief of staff howard baker 
and national security adviser colin powell told of a 1500man 
incursion targeted at contra supply sources and the kidnapping of 
rebel leaders participants in the meeting said 
but the troops had destroyed no major supply sites and captured 
no top contra commanders the administration conceded 
i suspect this is a little more orchestrated hype on the part 
of the administration dodd said after the meeting 
house speaker jim wright said he was told by nicaraguan foreign 
minister miguel descoto that president daniel ortega had asked the 
united nations to send an observer group to the border area to 
insure that neither side breaches the border

japans economy grew by 42 percent and its per 
capita gross national product overtook the united states last 
year the economic planning agency reported today 
the agency said japans per capita gnp the output of goods and 
services for each member of the population reached 19642 
compared with 18403 in the united states this was attributed 
mainly to the yens rise against the us dollar 
in 1986 when calculations were based on a dollar trading at 
16851 yen the us figure was 17464 and japans was 16330 in 
1987 the calculations were based on a dollar for 14462 yen the 
dollar currently is trading at about 127 yen 
japan had about 122 million people as of the middle of last 
year half of the united states 244 million but its economic 
output is more than half that of the united states 
the gnp growth of 42 percent in the calendar year 1987 compared 
with 24 percent the previous year helped by gains in housing and 
industrial equipment investment 
the economic planning agency said japans gnp grew by an 
inflationadjusted 17 percent in the octoberdecember quarter from 
the julyseptember quarter and the governments target of 37 
percent growth for fiscal 1987 which ends march 31 was in reach 
the original target was 35 percent but it was revised upward 
in december based on signs of an encouraging recovery in the 
manufacturing sector manufacturing earlier had been slumping 
because of the yens rise which makes japanese products more 
expensive and less competitive abroad

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir ended 
his talks here today after offering to go to moscow this spring to 
launch negotiations with the arabs as a way of breaking a deadlock 
over an international mideast 
peace conference 
but secretary of state george p shultz testifying in congress 
after a final session with shamir said the arab parties require 
a conference to launch negotiations 
therefore shultz told the senate budget committee there will 
be no negotiations without a properly structured conference 
shamir who had a onehour breakfast session with shultz to wind 
up a fourday visit flatly rejected a us proposal for a 
fullscale mideast conference 
it is not conducive to peace he said wednesday after 
meeting for two hours with president reagan at the white house 
shamir suggested direct arabisraeli negotiations be hold under 
us and soviet auspices but without a substantive role for moscow 
shultz told the committee the united states has always been 
willing to consider any approach that could lead to direct 
negotiations 
in fact he said the united states opposes and will not 
participate in an international conference designed to replace 
bilaterial negotiations 
shultz said the us proposal is designed to prevent 
interference by the hosts in the arabisrael talks 
this is a time for decision he said the situation on the 
ground does not serve anyones interests rapid positive change 
can occur 
reagan on wednesday cautioned that those who will say no to 
the us plan and the prime minister has not used this word 
need not answer to us theyll need to answer to themselves and 
their people as to why they turned down a realistic and sensible 
plan to achieve negotiations 
apparently ruling out any compromise reagan said the united 
states will not slice this initiative apart and will not abandon 
it 
shamir however reaffirmed his willingness to hold direct 
negotiations with jordan and palestinians under us and soviet 
auspices 
he said later at a news conference that reagan and soviet 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev who will meet in moscow in 
the spring could invite israel and the arabs to an international 
ceremony and then step aside allowing them to hold direct 
negotiations 
if there would be such a proposal i am ready shamir said 
it would be useful 
the prime minister said he would attend even if the soviets did 
not repair a 21year break in diplomatic relations with israel 
it has nothing to do with it he said 
such an international ceremony will give king hussein and 
other parties a clear international legitimacy for direct 
negotiations shamir said 
the idea of having the united states and the soviets convene the 
negotiations but not participate in them was broached to shamir 
in jerusalem last october by secretary of state george p shultz 
shamir accepted but king hussein of jordan rejected the 
proposal he called for an international conference held by the 
five permament members of the un security council the united 
states the soviet union china britain and france 
despite his own reservations shultz included an international 
conference in the plan for negotiations he presented two weeks ago 
to israel jordan and syria it would be convened next month and 
set the stage for negotiations starting may 1 
according to a senior us official reagans meeting with 
shamir focused almost exclusively on the issue 
the official who briefed under rules of anonymity said the two 
did not review israels concerns about the us proposal that it 
cede at least part of the west bank and gaza in exchange for arab 
recognition 
shamir will report to the israeli cabinet on sunday on his talks 
here until then the prime minister refused to either accept or 
reject the us proposal 
whatever the outcome shamir said israel intends to work with 
the united states in behalf of peace in the middle east 
sometimes there are differences between best friends shamir 
said and we regard the americans as our best friends now we 
have such a situation we have some differences with them we will 
try to overcome these differences 
vice president george bush hosting a dinner for shamir on 
wednesday night at the state department assured him no wedge 
will be driven between the united states and israel 
toasting shamir the vice president said we are like 
brothers our two countries friends and allies forever 
shamir in reply said israel was proud of its record as the 
most consistent supporter of the united states in the united 
nations and of sharing military technology with washington he said 
the usisraeli relationship is stronger than ever

president reagan has not discussed pardoning 
his former aides indicted in the irancontra affair his spokesman 
said today 
theres been no discussion of pardons white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said we dont discuss pardons period 
fitzwater was asked about such an action in light of wednesdays 
indictments of reagans former national security adviser john 
poindexter lt col oliver north and two arms dealers on charges 
in the diversion of iranian arms sales profits to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
the president has never criticized his aides for lying to 
congress shredding documents or participating in a coverup and 
while he has steadfastly refused to discuss the possibility of 
pardons he has been equally careful not to rule them out 
but several presidential and constitutional scholars said that 
if he decides to pardon any of the irancontra defendants reagan 
probably will wait until after the november election to prevent the 
issue from hurting republican candidates 
reagan is well aware of the example of his republican 
predecessor gerald ford whose watergate pardon of richard nixon 
on sept 8 1974 sent fords popularity ratings tumbling and 
helped put a democrat into the white house in the next election 
in the case at hand reagan has made it clear particularly in 
his description of north as an american hero that he is 
giving the former national security council aide the benefit of the 
doubt 
after congress completed its irancontra investigation reagan 
went on national television to say he thought north and poindexter 
believed they were doing what i wouldve wanted done 
and when he was questioned at one point about the law barring 
direct or indirect military aid to the contras reagan responded 
i dont think that the law was broken 
if reagan chooses to grant pardons to anyone connected with the 
affair he would not even have to list a specific crime that is 
being pardoned 
such sweeping power amounts to a legal grant of absolution 
enshrined in the constitution the founding fathers borrowed the 
concept from english common law 
the constitution allows a president virtually unlimited 
authority to pardon involving offenses against the united tates 
except in cases of impeachment 
hes really very free said c thomas dienes a professor of 
constitutional law at george washington university 
a president is able to grant a pardon involving a federal crime 
solely on his own initiative he need not consult anyone nor even 
wait for an indictment or conviction before taking action dienes 
said 
dienes said the principal cost of a reagan pardon would be 
political he said the president would have to make a case for 
the pardon by arguing that he believed his subordinates had acted 
in the cause of the national security or that he wanted to spare 
the country a national trauma 
im sure hed catch a lot of political flak and he wants to 
go down as a popular president but since north was perceived by 
some as a popular hero im not certain thered be such negative 
reaction dienes said 
during his nearly eight years in office reagan has granted 333 
pardons out of 1894 requests according to the justice department 
office in charge of handling them but none of the cases has had 
anywhere near the high profile of the irancontra indictments 
although reagan is barred from running again his decision could 
affect vice president george bushs chances and those of other gop 
candidates according to stephen hess a senior fellow and 
specialist in presidential affairs at the brookings institution in 
washington 
hess predicts that if reagan decides to pardon any irancontra 
figures he will wait until after the november elections 
since fords action cost him the election i doubt well see 
reagan move before november hess said 
reagan would not leave such a decision to a democrat nor would 
he burden bush with it if he were elected hess reasoned 
i would be stunned if there isnt a pardon between election 
day and january 1989 he said

the national marine fisheries service on 
thursday ordered foreign nations that export tuna to the united 
states to reduce the number of dolphins killed during fishing 
countries that do not reduce dolphin deaths will no longer be 
allowed to export tuna to the united states the commerce 
department agency said 
the order covers foreign fleets that catch yellowfin tuna in 
purse seine nets and requires them to establish dolphin protection 
rules similar to those that already cover us fishermen 
the regulation will take effect in midapril and requires that 
the rate of dolphins killed by the foreign fleets be reduced to the 
us fishing fleet level by 1991 the fisheries service said 
the problem occurs primarily in the eastern tropical pacific 
ocean where fishing vessels search for schools of dolphins 
yellowfin tuna tend to congregate beneath the dolphins and thus 
fishermen can more easily find the tuna 
fishermen then encircle both groups of fish with their nets the 
majority of dolphins are able to escape or are released by the 
fishermen officials said but some become tangled in the nets and 
drown

a top nasa official warned the space 
community thursday that an absolute disaster to nasa looms if 
congress votes only a small increase in the space agencys budget 
for next year 
president reagan has proposed a budget of 115 billion for the 
year that begins in october an increase of 20 percent over the 
current year 
dale myers deputy administrator of the national aeronautics and 
space administration told a symposium that where the 20 percent 
increase is concerned we are probably not going to make it 
he said it probably will be closer to 2 percent 
myers told the american astronautical society there probably 
wouldnt be any problem if nasa was dealing with only the 
congressional committees that have oversight responsibility for the 
agency 
the problem is were caught in this terrible budget crunch 
decisions are being made by a budget committee which is not that 
familiar with the space program he said at the goddard space 
flight center 
last year we got hurt very badly myers said we got a 
budget cut and because of that now we are showing a 20 percent 
increase in outlays this year compared to last year and the 
average increase is going to be something like 2 percent 
if we get the 2 percent increase which is an easy out for 
congress it is an absolute disaster to nasa he said we have 
not even imagined what we would have to cut back if we are given a 
2 percent situation i just cant imagine that would happen but 
it could happen he said 
myers said it was unfortunate that space activities are in a 
part of the budget where nasa the national science foundation 
and all the high technologies activity of the government are all 
tangled up with some social programs where tradeoffs are being made 
in a very isolated area 
last week rep edward boland dmass chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on housing and independent agencies 
threatened to cancel money for nasas proposed space station if 
housing programs were cut 
myers said nasa has never been caught in such a difficult budget 
situation

the national geographic society released 
pictures today of an egyptian boat photographed with special 
equipment in a stone chamber where the royal vessel was entombed 
beside the great pyramid of khufu 4600 years ago 
national geographic officials said the photographs were taken 
with remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that the 
chamber then was sealed leaving the ancient craft undisturbed in 
its resting place 
a similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in 1954 that 
142footlong craft was excavated reassembled and put in a museum 
specially constructed for its display officials said that boat now 
is decaying rapidly 
but new techniques permitted experts from the egyptian 
antiquities organization and from the united states to survey the 
new boat using remote cameras the national geographic announced 
today the boat was documented last october and its chamber then 
was sealed with the craft untouched 
the national geographic said in a release that a joint 
usegyptian team of scientists had hoped that the chamber 
containing the new boat had remained airtight during the 46 
centuries since it was sealed 
in an effort to capture samples of that air the scientists used 
a drill enclosed in an air lock an arrangement of vacuum tubes was 
used to suck the chambers air into storage tanks for analysis 
the air in the chamber proved to be moderately polluted urban 
air said pieter tans a scientist from the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration who analyzed the samples 
he said this proves that the chamber was not sealed and 
possibily never was samples of the cap of the chamber said tans 
showed that the rock was a light limestone 
the rock was so permiable that this pit probably has never 
been sealed he said 
remote television pictures taken inside the chamber detected a 
beetle which immediately proved officials said that the chamber 
had been unsealed for some time 
tans said the insect was identified as a common desert beetle 
that feeds on fungi that is commonly found in decaying wood 
television and still cameras lowered into the drill hole were 
able to document the entire interior of the boat chamber the tv 
camera used fiber optics to light the chamber in this way the 
lights added no heat to tomb environment 
photos released by the national geographic show a mound of cedar 
timbers collapsed to the floor of a long chamber that had been cut 
with precision out of solid limestone bedrock 
scientists studying the pictures have identified various boat 
parts including oar blades deckhouse and hull planking there was 
no sign of a mast sail or rigging 
the video camera detected hieroglyphic markings on the ceiling 
of the chamber the national geographic interpreted these symbols 
as measurements and as the name of the team of workers who carved 
the stone used in the chamber 
the national geographic announcement said the purposes of the 
boat and of its sister craft excavated in 1954 remain a mystery 
why did the ancient egyptians disassemble and bury two 
fullsize royal ships at the base of the great pyramid the 
announcement asks 
the boats are thought to have been entombed to honor the pharoah 
khufu by his son and successor djedefre according to the national 
geographic 
but it is not known if the boats were used to bring khufus body 
on the nile from his palace at memphis to the pyramid at giza or 
if the craft were entombed in the belief that khufu would use them 
in an afterlife 
a report on the exploration of the boat chamber is carried in 
the april issue of national geographic the monthly magazine of the 
national geographic society

the state civil rights agency has ordered 
california polytechnic state university at san luis obispo to pay 
20000 to a woman for four years of vicious treatment in a 
campus industrial paint shop 
the harassment of carol bowlby the first woman hired by the 
shop included namecalling placing a pictures of a naked woman in 
her lunch box and refusing to work with her said the fair 
employment and housing commission 
ms bowlbys work environment was offensive hostile 
oppressive and intimidating and contributed to her medical 
problems and need for psychiatric care the commission said in a 
41 decision released wednesday it also said the university failed 
to investigate her complaints properly or discipline her coworkers 
commissioner michael johnson dissented he described ms bowlby 
as a substandard employee and said the shop was a 
roughandtumble workplace where strong language and namecalling 
were common 
the commissions majority said the universitys sincere and 
laudable effort to bring a woman into a maledominated field 
did not excuse the vicious treatment she did receive because of 
her sex 
the commission awarded her 20000 for emotional distress but 
concluded her departure from the job in 1982 was voluntary and 
refused additional damages for lost wages 
attorney gloria barrios who prosecuted the case for the state 
fair employment and housing department said ms bowlby whose 
disability and rehabilitation costs have already been paid by the 
university now works at a grocery in san luis obispo 
university lawyer thomas trager said no decision has been made 
on an appeal to superior court but he said the school denies that 
ms bowlby was harassed because of her sex 
the commission said ms bowlbys difficulties began almost 
immediately after she was hired as the first woman in the 
universitys new trainee program for women and minorities in its 
plant operations paint shop 
her job evaluations were satisfactory at first but got worse as 
time went on and she was never rated as qualified to become a 
fullfledged painter she reacted badly to criticism and was 
considered difficult to work with the commission said 
but those difficulties were caused at least in part by the 
hostility she suffered because of her sex the commission said

ireland cast aside its economic woes and 
the latest violence in ulster to stage its biggest ever st 
patricks day parade thursday celebrating the irish patron saint 
as well as the capitals 1000th birthday 
a record crowd of 300000 people including thousands of 
american tourists thronged the threemile parade route from st 
stephens green to oconnell street the main thoroughfare 
many adorned their lapels with sprigs of shamrock the wild 
clover that is irelands national emblem 
about 6000 people took part in the parade of dancers marching 
bands and historictheme floats skies were overcast but the rain 
held off 
march 1420 was designated st patricks week in honor of 
irelands patron saint and dublins millennium celebrations with 
daily displays of irish folk music dance and street theater 
in northern ireland st patricks day celebrations were heavily 
overshadowed by wednesdays outbreak of sectarian violence when a 
protestant gunman shot and threw grenades at catholic mourners 
burying three irish republican army guerrillas in belfast three 
people died and 68 were wounded 
mourners wearing shamrocks and green armbands attended the 
funeral thursday of a slain ira guerrilla a day after the bloodbath 
at milltown cemetery the service was peaceful 
the violence had little visible impact on the dublin parade it 
was a day to set aside thoughts of an unemployment rate near 18 
percent high taxation and an emigration outflow estimated at 
30000 a year 
prime minister charles haughey reviewed the parade from a stand 
outside the general post office where rebels launched the easter 
rising of 1916 against british rule 
organizers said crews from more than 80 tv stations in the 
united states and canada photographed the parade 
government offices schools banks and most businesses were 
closed in the south but many industries offices and department 
stores stayed open in northern ireland where the majority is 
protestant and doesnt regard st patricks day as a national 
holiday 
the irish also took a somewhat bemused look at how the united 
states celebrates march 17 
theres a bar in west 39th street that is advertising live 
leprechauns and bagpipe music tonight theres even a jewish 
delicatessen on 47th street offering irish bagels marveled the 
irish times correspondent in new york eugene mceldowney 
in dublin botanist charles nelson remarked we tend to think 
of the americans as being a bit eccentric in this regard 
some us customs seemed to be catching on here an american 
hamburger chain was selling shamrockflavored shakes 
roman catholic churches were full for morning mass and later 
the pubs filled up for celebrations 
some irish newspapers marked the day by editorializing about it 
in irish or gaelic which is the countrys first official 
language although only a minority are fluent in it 
the irish independent editorializing in english wondered what 
st patrick the 5th century missionary who christianized ireland 
would think of the country were he to return 
as a missionary he would have to come to the conclusion that 
the faith he worked so hard to spread here has come on bad times 
there are plenty of churches but they are not always packed there 
are many people who call themselves christian but may not be 
entitled to do so it said 
and if he went to northern ireland where he lived as a young 
man what would he make of the violence hate and bigotry the 
paper asked 
but it also noted that he would find a worldwide irish diaspora 
who carried with them into exile an attitude to life which was 
fashioned basically by what patrick taught our ancestors 1500 
years ago that is a plus

gov evan mecham testified today that he 
never ordered anyone to hamper an investigation into an aides 
alleged death threat but said he told arizonas top police officer 
not to cooperate with the probe 
in his second day of testimony in his impeachment trial mecham 
confirmed that in a nov 15 conversation with department of public 
safety director ralph milstead i said if you want my 
permission you dont have it 
mecham acknowledged he told milstead the attorney general is 
trying to hang me and im not going to help him however he said 
he had never ordered anyone to hamper the investigation and denied 
any intent to break the law 
he said he told milstead to tell attorney general bob corbins 
office we have looked into this matter and theres nothing to 
it 
the 63yearold firstterm governor said he had been told by 
department of administration director max hawkins that the alleged 
threat was a bunch of hot air that would go away 
mecham said that when he was first told of the alleged threat 
the head of his security details dps lt beau johnson did not 
specify that it was reported to be an actual death threat 
did you ever hear the words from lt johnson death threat 
asked defense attorney fred craft 
i absolutely did not said mecham he insisted that johnson 
also did not say it involved a possible felony of tampering with a 
grand jury witness 
johnson has testified that he told the governor the alleged 
threat involved a possible felony of tampering a grand jury witness 
milstead testified last week that mecham ordered him not to 
cooperate with a corbin investigation the attorney general was 
looking into an alleged death threat against former mecham aide 
donna carlson who was about to testify before a grand jury on 
mechams failure to report a 350000 campaign loan 
the governor whose lawyers have been trying to undermine the 
credibility of the states top police official testified wednesday 
he would have had ample grounds to fire milstead he said he also 
would have fired ms carlson had he known she told milstead last 
year the governor was considering replacing him 
i had to trust the people i was dealing with mecham said 
asked by craft if the governor still trusted those people mecham 
answered not some of them it was a trust misplaced 
the governor contended an internal investigation showed that 
milstead misused state vehicles for personal purposes and used a 
state secretary to type his masters thesis 
in response dps spokesman sgt allan schmidt said the 
investigators found no reason not to retain him milstead and no 
problems save his management style 
mecham appeared calm and softspoken during his testimony 
wednesday all 29 senators who are serving as mechams judge and 
jury stood when he entered the senate chamber and was sworn in 
later some said the action was suggested in a note passed around 
by president carl kunasek a republican 
before wednesdays session mecham had been away from the 
capital for more than a month operating out of a suburban office 
he calls his government in exile 
mecham the first us governor to face an impeachment trial in 
six decades retains his salary and title but secretary of state 
rose mofford a democrat has gubernatorial power pending the 
outcome of the trial 
testimony so far has focused on the charge that mecham confidant 
lee watkins a former state prison construction chief made a death 
threat on nov 12 against ms carlson watkins has denied any 
threat and has pleaded the fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in refusing to testify 
mecham said he did not consider watkins who arranged the 
350000 campaign loan to be a major fundraiser for his 1986 
campaign and that he did not seek to protect him as ms carlson 
said he did 
protect him from what the governor asserted id like for 
somebody to tell me what i protected him from 
the governor denied jobs were doled out in his administration 
based on how much money a person contributed or raised for his 
campaign 
ms carlson testified last week that when she once complained 
about watkins position in the governors inner circle she was told 
by the governors thenchief of staff we have to take care of 
lee he raised a lot of money for the campaign 
on wednesday sam udall mechams former appointments secretary 
testified that campaign contributions were a criterion although 
not a major one in making appointments to boards and commissions 
mecham said he felt he could not trust corbin after the governor 
sought his advice on a legal issue early last year and the matter 
wound up under investigation 
thats when i knew we were in big trouble mecham said 
adding that after that we had as little relationship with the 
attorney generals office as possible 
corbins office led the investigation that resulted in mechams 
indictment on six felony counts of allegedly concealing the 
350000 loan the governor faces an april 21 criminal trial on 
those charges and a may 17 recall election 
in the impeachment a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is 
required to convict mecham

kim daejung stepped down as leader of 
his party thursday reviving hopes for reuniting the fractured 
opposition before crucial legislative elections next month 
kim daejung said he was resigning as president of the party for 
peace and democracy to help unite the two leading opposition 
parties 
the departure of kim deajung follows the resignation last month 
of rival opposition leader kim youngsam who headed the 
reunification democratic party both kims ran for president in 
decembers presidential election thus ensuring victory for the 
government candidate roh taewoo 
since their presidential defeat the two kims have been under 
pressure to step aside to clear the way for a merger of the two 
parties 
standing at the crossroads of unification or division i have 
decided to step down to help facilitate the opposition merger 
which is our supreme task kim said in a statement 
park youngsook who read the statement said the 62yearold 
kim could not make the announcement personally because he was not 
feeling well kim was reported to be in seclusion 
mrs park was named acting party president she declined to 
answer questions about what would happen if the opposition merger 
failed she said time was running out and expressed hope the 
opposition would unite by sunday 
it was unclear however whether kim daejungs resignation 
would lead to an opposition merger unification talks are expected 
to start friday but such thorny issues as power distribution 
remain to be solved 
kim youngsams party reserved official comment but some party 
officials privately expressed distrust and said they feared the 
resignation would be a trick 
we are skeptical in view of kim daejungs duplicity in the 
past said one party official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
the two kims have been bitter rivals kim daejung and his 
supporters split from the reunification democratic party to mount a 
separate presidential campaign 
months of efforts to unite the opposition collapsed last week 
when kim daejung rejected a lastminute demand from the 
reunification democratic party that he step down and take a back 
seat if a unified opposition party is formed 
kim daejung has been a major figure in south korean politics 
for three decades he gained international fame with his 
unflinching opposition to the countrys past authoritarian 
governments and devotion to human rights activity 
kim daejungs party officials could not comment on their 
leaders political future but assumed he would continue to work for 
the opposition 
kim daejung said in his resignation statement i make it 
clear that i will make all the efforts i can in the vanguard of the 
people in order to win the general elections

in another era it might seem an odd alliance 
the white southern political insider and the flamboyant black 
civil rights activist but in what jesse jackson calls the new 
south his relationship with bert lance is a sign of the times 
lance long a fixture on the georgia political scene and the 
budget director under former president jimmy carter is one of 
jacksons closest advisers in his 1988 presidential bid 
i have a relationship thats fairly well known with rev 
jackson lance said in a telephone interview he is a very good 
candidate who has run a superb campaign 
lance supported jackson in georgias primary last week and 
according to jackson aides the two consult by telephone as often 
as once a day 
jesse jackson has got a message that the country is concerned 
about especially about drugs especially about economic common 
ground these things are important to the country said lance 
who left the carter administration under a cloud of allegations 
about his previous activities as a banker 
he declined to specify what advice he gives jackson but said 
their relationship began during jacksons 1984 white house bid 
the relationship demonstrates how the candidate who ran under an 
antiestablishment banner four years ago now is reaching out for 
establishment advice as he tries to craft a more mainstream 
campaign and expand his base beyond his core black constituency 
so far the gambit seems on course jackson has made no 
significant gaffes in his campaign avoiding the kind of slips 
that alienated jewish voters in 1984 when he used the words 
hymie and hymietown 
and he has been winning white votes in far greater numbers than 
he did in 1984 
he also consults at times with such party leaders as jimmy 
carter clark clifford and shirley chisholm according to his 
press secretary 
among jacksons close advisers is political consultant ann 
lewis former democratic national committee political director one 
of his biggest boosters among political strategy types she has 
given him pointers on jewish and womens questions and campaign 
strategy especially in the many months before he hired a campaign 
manager 
lewis introduced jackson to carol ocleireacain an official of 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
union who has become a key economic adviser she was primarily 
responsible for conceiving one of jacksons central economic 
themes a proposal to reinvest corporate pension funds in domestic 
jobs programs 
democrat william gray chairman of the house budget committee 
is another jackson economic adviser 
on foreign policy matters jackson leans on bob borosage who 
took a leave from his job as director of the liberal think tank 
institute for policy studies to advise the campaign and travel 
with jackson rep ron dellums dcalif a member of the house 
armed services committee and jim zogby head of the arab american 
institute 
jackson signed up one of californias most powerful 
officeholders and savvy black politicians assembly speaker willie 
brown as his campaign chairman another confidant is walter 
fauntroy the nonvoting house member from the district of columbia 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower has endorsed 
jackson and advises him on farm policy former new mexico gov 
toney anaya and mississippi educator armando guitierrez specialize 
in hispanic issues 
jacksons most senior aide is frank watkins who met him in 
1969 watkins is devoting himself to analysing and targeting states 
and congressional districts 
one change from 1984 is a semblance of organization in the 
jackson campaign thanks in large part to campaign manager gerald 
austin the 11thhour addition of austin last fall gave the 
campaign a sense that somebody is running the railroad said 
lewis 
he really has provided the structural underpinning to support 
jackson that i dont think jackson ever had before she said 
a nononsense political operative who managed gov richard 
celestes campaign in ohio austin is jewish and said he had been 
offended by jacksons reference to jews as hymie he confronted 
jackson on the topic before taking the job and said he accepted 
the apology the candidate offered 
austin has turned around the campaigns tendency toward 
indecisiveness say some who deal with the campaign he also 
developed jacksons tv commercials himself 
a direct mail operation is in place run by california mail 
consultant mal warwick he is getting good results by targeting a 
spectrum of democratic voters and the mail has become a major 
party of fundraising for the cash poor campaign

than 1300 in the generation of occupation 
an army spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
demolishing houses is very effective it serves as a warning to 
everyone in a village not to take action against people they 
suspect of working with israel 
people whose homes are razed are not allowed to rebuild them so 
most have resorted to living in tents 
among those opposing the policy are the united states 
international committee of the red cross and united nations 
they denounce it as collective punishment usually imposed 
without court review or due process in most cases the penalty 
does not affect the suspect who may be dead jailed or a fugitive 
abroad 
in the case of bidu the suspects were a son of mrs al shiah 
and two sons of bedwan the parents said they did not even know 
ibrahim al shiah 17 nissam bedwan 23 and mohammed bedwan 20 
were accused of anything until their houses were bulldozed the 
night of march 7 
mrs al shiah stood weeping beside the rubble that had been a 
fiveroom home and said i begged the soldiers tell me for 
gods sake what have we done with her were three small 
daughters dressed in plastic sandles and thin mudcaked dresses on 
the chilly morning 
the soldiers wouldnt tell us anything she said they 
just took the children from their beds and carried them out of the 
house her husband khalid is an unemployed handyman 
pools of muddy rainwater covered the plastic floors of two white 
tents the red cross provided tattered blankets were piled at the 
back of one which reeked of mildew 
discarded in a muddy olive grove were family furniture and 
possessions two smashed beds a refrigerator on its side a 
mudcaked gas stove two rainsoaked quilts pieces of a cabinet a 
childs red boot 
metal chairs pots pans and a red pillow could be seen buried 
in the debris of the house 
mrs al shiah said the soldiers arrived at about midnight put 
the villages 4000 residents under curfew and cut off the 
electricity before bring in the bulldozer 
bedwan said now everybody in this village feels he is not 
safe he stood quietly at the site of the 10room home he had 
built over a period of 20 years all that remained was part of one 
wall painted bright pink 
felicia langer an israeli lawyer who represents palestinians 
said leveling houses punishes people who are not accused of any 
offense much less guilty 
she says it violates the 1949 geneva convention on treatment of 
civilians in occupied zones which forbids destruction of property 
as a punishment or deterrent 
israels supreme court has ruled the practice legal under 
emergency regulations issued in 1945 by the british administration 
governing palestine at the time those regulations have been the 
basis for several extraordinary measures including censorship

the nations trade deficit widened slightly in 
january to 124 billion after two months of sharp improvements 
the commerce department said today 
the excess of imports over exports was up from the 122 billion 
deficit in december 
exports which had propelled improvement in november and 
december fell by 10 percent in january to 223 billion 
the reagan administration said the figures are better than they 
appear at first glance 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called it an 
excellent report he said that in the last three months we 
have seen a dramatic drop in the trade deficit 
there was a seasonal decline in exports which have dropped in 
january every year of this decade said commerce secretary c 
william verity in a statement overall he said the figures 
confirm the improving trend of the past few months 
there is obviously a long way to go to eliminate the trade 
deficit but we are on the right track verity said 
private analysts generally agreed that the january figures 
should not be read as an indication of a worsening trade balance 
and noted that januarys figure although higher than december was 
an improvement from both the 132 billion november deficit and the 
record 176 billion october shortfall 
we tend to be very impatient and all expect dramatic 
improvements every month but the trade numbers are very time 
consuming to change said jay goldinger chief economist for 
capital insight a los angeles brokerage house its a large 
vessel and it cant move that quickly but i believe the ship 
continues to travel in the right direction 
analysts had expected a deterioration of the trade balance in 
january noting that exports are traditionally down in that month 
however imports also fell in january by 6 percent to 348 
billion 
thus the deficit for the month eagerly followed by financial 
markets was somewhat better than most analysts had expected 
its hard for me to see how we can repeat the same magnitude 
of growth in exports that we had in the two previous months said 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston company economic 
advisers ind 
exports had incrased 94 percent in november and 42 percent in 
december to record levels 
analysts claim that the overall trade deficit is shrinking but 
that improvements will be agonizingly slow with many setbacks along 
the way like januarys 
still the fact that imports were down was viewed as a bright 
spot in the report 
the deficit with japan the country with which this nation runs 
its largest deficit fell by 176 percent in january to 39 
billion the lowest onemonth level since december 1986 
one major category of imports from japan new automobiles 
registered a 195 percent drop in january to 16 billion 
and the nation even showed its first surplus in nearly three 
years with britain in january exporting 75 million more than it 
imported 
despite the drop in january exports manufacturing industry 
leaders have said that recent gains in exports point to a genuine 
boom due in large part to a weaker dollar now worth just half 
its value of three years against other key currencies 
a weaker dollar makes us goods cheaper abroad and foreign 
products more expensive at home 
the trade deficit with canada increased to 112 billion from 
6328 million in december 
the deficit with western europe declined to 133 billion from 
273 billion 
the deficit with the newly industrialized countries of asia 
taiwan south korea singapore and hong kong was up to 292 
billion from 248 billion in december 
the deficit with the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries rose to 103 billion from 8872 million 
the trade figures unlike many other government economic 
statistics are not adjusted to remove recurring seasonal effects 
like the postchristmas dip in exports 
because of this many analysts claim the monthly trade reports 
can often be misleading even though they are closely watched in 
financial markets 
beginning with april the commerce department will seasonally 
adjust its trade figures 
despite anticipated monthtomonth fluctuations most observers 
suggest that the overall trade balance definitely is beginning to 
improve and as import prices rise further because of the 
lowervalued dollar the gap is likely to shrink even more 
the trend has changed but its not going to happen 
overnight said goldinger 
last year the trade deficit reached record dimensions no matter 
how measured in terms of merchandise trade alone the shortfall 
reached 1712 billion 
a broader measure of trade the current account deficit 
which also includes investment flows and trade in services reached 
1607 billion last year also a record 
the commerce department released details on the current account 
deficit earlier this week 
however both sets of figures merchandise trade and current 
account showed improvements in the final three months of 1987

career diplomat john r davis presented 
his credentials thursday as us ambassador to poland ending a 
fiveyear period in which washington had no topranked envoy here 
following the imposition of martial law 
davis who had been serving as charge daffaires in warsaw 
formally became ambassador at a ceremony at the governments 
belvedere palace where he was received by kazimierz barcikowski 
vicepresident of the council of state 
reviewing relations with poland prior to the ceremony davis 
applauded polish steps toward economic and political reform and 
expressed hope for further progress in the area of human rights 
the situation between the two countries has been unnaturally 
strained in recent years he said 
the united states placed economic sanctions on poland after the 
dec 13 1981 imposition of martial law and the suppression of the 
solidarity independent trade union 
soon after martial law the polish ambassador to washington 
defected and was not replaced the former us ambassador francis 
meehan completed his tour in 1983 and poland rejected the us 
nominee to succeed him 
but following the release of political prisoners in 1986 and the 
lifting of the last of the us sanctions last year relations 
gradually warmed culminating in the september visit of vice 
president george bush who was allowed to address the polish people 
on national television 
during his visit bush announced that the two countries had 
agreed to exchange ambassadors 
fortunately poland proclaimed a policy of national 
reconciliation and reform and that has changed the picture here as 
its been implemented slowly davis said in a meeting march 11 
with journalists 
we certainly find ourselves today in a position to support 
polish efforts for economic reform and political reform and to 
applaud the steps they have taken he said we retain our 
interest in human rights and hope that progress in this field 
continues 
davis said the us economic sanctions were designed to persuade 
the government to lift martial law release political prisoners and 
resume the dialogue with solidarity 
by and large i think those objectives were achieved i dont 
attribute that to the sanctions however but to the decisions 
made by the polish government itself he said 
solidarity remains outlawed and davis said the government still 
has not invited the opposition as a group to participate in 
national decisionmaking although overtures have been made to some 
individuals 
nevertheless davis said the ideals of solidarity are very 
much alive and many of the objectives of solidarity have been 
obtained 
the group is far from dead its remarkably lively considering 
the length of time that has gone by and the difficulties of 
communicating he said 
on the day davis presented his credentials police around the 
country issued warnings to members of solidaritys national 
executive commission that they may be imprisoned if they persist in 
opposition activities 
the ambassador said a meeting between solidarity leader lech 
walesa and wojciech jaruzelski president and first secretary of 
the polish united workers communist party would be of 
tremendous symbolic value not only here but abroad 
he said he hoped the government would consider the possibility 
because it would aid its efforts to enlist broader public support 
for its reform program 
but he praised the progress poland has made in other areas he 
cited recent publication of an interview by solidarity adviser 
bronislaw geremek the end to jamming of western radio 
polishlanguage broadcasts jan 1 and relaxation of censorship to 
an extent that in domestic affairs it is almost nonexistent

through the quad cities 
its hard for the department and state legislature to work as 
hard as we did last year to pass a water protection act and to 
allow something like that to occur said larry wilson director 
of the natural resources department 
seattles parade down fourth avenue follows a wide green stripe 
laid down in a tradition established by the late john doyle bishop

the irish way oconnor said citing st patrick irelands 
patron saint he said in his name we will not give up the 
parade will go on

ortega speaking at a news conference before a meeting with 14 
opposition parties called the us troop movement a dangerous 
act and said the united states was trying to use the honduran 
army to save the contra forces 
ortega earlier warned the nation that us forces may invade 
nicaragua to save contra rebels whom he said were driven into 
honduras by sandinista troops

talks 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of the foreign ministry

along the border but did not enter honduras 
weve been engaged in a routine military operation designed to 
push the contras back across the border where they came from in 
honduran territory that operation reached the border there was 
firing at the border theres been a crossfire and theres been 
fighting alongside the border bendana said 
the operations have succesfully been concluded and we dont 
plan to stay along the border region in fact this deescalation 
has already begun he said

bendana said the government had called for the united nations 
and organization of american states to visit the area of fighting 
to establish what the facts are end these accusations 
he said the deployment of american soldiers bodes ill for 
ceasefire talks scheduled monday in nicaragua but makes the 
negotiations more urgent we are bent on having the ceasefire 
talks begin on monday once again

that nicaraguan troops were being mobilized throughout the country

israeli warplanes divebombed a palestine 
liberation organization base in druseheld territory above beirut 
on thursday in the deepest air raid into lebanon this year 
police said one guerrilla was killed and another was wounded 
along with his 2yearold son it was israels third air strike 
against palestinian targets in lebanon since january 
the air strike came a day after guerrillas in south lebanon 
fired sovietmade katyusha rockets into northern israel shattering 
windows and damaging citrus trees no casualties were reported 
the new assault was mounted by six israeli fighterbombers 
demolishing a twostory building used as a base by the democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine with four direct shell hits 
police said 
the moscoworiented front headed by nayef hawatmeh is one of 
the eight factions making up yasser arafats plo 
a red mercedesbenz was seen buried in the rubble of the 
stricken base in aynab in the chouf mountains overlooking beiruts 
international airport the base is just eight miles from beirut 
palls of black smoke billowed from the target and police said 
all traffic at the airport was suspended for 15 minutes 
the sound of explosions could be heard across the city as the 
howling jets crisscrossed the skies drawing antiaircraft fire 
from guerrilla positions 
pilots released balloons to deflect heatseeking shoulderfired 
sam7 missiles unleashed by guerrillas white puffs of smoke dotted 
the sky around the planes but none was hit 
police said the jets staged repeated mock attacks on palestinian 
bases in nearby chemlan bayssour and kabr shmoun in the 10minute 
raid sending hundreds of villagers as well as guerrillas diving 
for cover 
but there were no bombing sorties against bases in those 
villages of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command and the fatahuprising both at odds with 
arafat 
the israeli army command said the targets had served as bases 
for planning and launching attacks against israel 
all our planes returned safely and the pilots reported the 
destruction of the targets a short israeli statement said 
the guerrilla who was killed was standing sentry outside the 
base when the jets struck at aynab said the fronts chouf 
commander who goes by the nom de guerre of abu raad 
he said the wounded child who was identified only as mohammed 
suffered wounds in the head from flying glass shards his father 
who is a front fighter was injured in the face and waist 
mohammeds mother was not hurt 
one guerrilla crawled out of the debris unharmed he stood over 
the rubble flashing the v for victory sign with one hand and 
brandishing a sovietmade ak47 assault rifle with the other 
abu raad said the casualties were low because the plo had 
ordered all guerrillas in lebanon to brace for air attacks in 
retaliation for palestinian riots against israels occupation in

a campaign to replace a polar bear killed 
by police at vilas park zoo has drawn 50000 in contributions not 
counting a companys offer to cover the full cost of one bear 
officials say 
its really unbelievable zoo director david hall said 
wednesday 
the zoos only polar bear chief was shot and later destroyed 
by police sunday after a man with a history of mental problems 
climbed into the cage and was injured by the animal the man who 
authorities wont identify sustained a head wound and is in a 
mental health facility pending a committment hearing 
radio station wmgn reported raising 27700 on wednesday when 
it broadcast live from the zoo all day in addition the zoo has 
gotten direct donations of about 17000 including two quarters 
ttaped to an index card and several dollar bills tucked inside a 
childs drawing of a bear hall said 
the wisconsin state journal said it had received checks and cash 
amounting to 2400 through donations to a bring a polar bear 
back to our zoo fund 
the rayovac corp a madisonbased battery manufacturer pledged 
to cover the entire cost for one bear we just decided that this 
thing has great support from the community spokesman john 
daggett said 
hall said he is hoping to obtain a pair of bears but even if 
they are found the money raised will more than cover the expense 
he estimated the cost of a polar bear at 10000 to 15000 a 
young mating pair would cost an additional 20000 to 30000 
but hall said finding polar bears for the zoo may prove to be a 
much harder task than raising the money were working on it but 
theyre a difficult animal to acquire 
polar bears in the wild are endangered and records from zoos in 
the united states and europe indicate only eight were born in 
captivity in 1986 
finding a mate the same age is not an easy task hall added 
if we cant get a cub well try for an older animal 
money left over will go to the construction of the new vilas zoo 
education building which will cost about 450000

threetime iditarod trail sled dog race 
winner susan butcher is shooting for a fourth victory next year 
saying she can whittle a day off her record time to cover the 1150 
milecourse in just 10 days 
i think it can be done and i want to be the one to do it 
she said 
butcher left her nearest competitor miles behind on the 
windblown bering sea coast wednesday night to breeze into the 
record books with her third straight victory 
the 33yearold musher charged down front street in this old 
gold mining town at 842 pm ast wednesday she covered the 
stormwracked course from anchorage to nome in 11 days 11 hours 
and 41 minutes 
her elapsed time the actual time on the course minus the time 
spent on mandatory breaks set a record for the races longer 
more arduous northern route she broke her own record set in 1986 
and last year she set the record for the southern route 
it means a lot to me to win three years in a row said the 
flushed and perspiring musher but the win doesnt mean as much 
to me as knowing the dogs were able to do it 
race officials presented her dog teams leaders granite and 
tolstoy with wreaths of plastic yellow roses they said real roses 
would have wilted quickly in the 10degree temperature fanned by 
30mph winds 
the dogs ice hanging from their muzzles appeared perplexed by 
the glaring television lights and the press of the crowd chanting 
susan susan 
she was met by her husband dave monson who won the 1000mile 
yukon quest international sled dog race earlier this month 
butcher received 30000 for winning down from last years top 
prize of 50000 the financial problems of the race committee 
during the past year caused her winning check last year to bounce 
although she eventually collected all her money 
butcher held an unthreatened lead since tuesday when she blew 
by martin buser 171 miles from nome 
she said she would be back for the 17th annual iditarod next 
year but added she might give up the 200 and 300mile 
intermediate races she ran this year 
its been a long year she said 
only one other musher rick swenson has ever won the race four 
times butcher and swenson are the only ones in 16 years ever to 
win more than once

the jury in the cocainesmuggling 
trial of carlos lehder rivas got its first look at a large amount 
of cocaine thursday 126 kilograms worth 63 million 
lehder 38 a reputed colombian drug lord is on trial on 
charges he and others conspired to bring 33 tons of cocaine into 
the united states from colombia via normans cay in the bahamas 
the 277 pounds of cocaine brought into court on a cart covered 
with a sheet was seized on march 5 1980 from a large safe at a 
miamiarea stash house according to court testimony 
extra drug agents were in the courtroom when the cocaine was 
displayed the halls outside the courtroom were cleared as the cart 
was wheeled to and from the chamber 
richard crawford a federal drug agent with the new york drug 
enforcement task force displayed a twokilo package that carried 
the initials cia 
crawford said he came to miami in february 1980 to trace the 
source of cocaine coming into the new york area 
in arguments earlier this week over the admissability of the 
cocaine as evidence us attorney robert w merkle said the 
cocaine would be linked to lehder through testimony and documents 
in 1980 tulio e ayerbe was arrested in connection with the 
seizure one of the largest in us history 
defense attorneys had argued that the cocaine was not tied to 
lehder and that its admission was irrelevant and prejudicial 
the government has said it can tie the miami cocaine to lehder 
through car rental records and because the warehouse it was 
delivered to was used by one of lehders business fronts 
merkle has claimed the cocaine shown the jury was part of a 
500kilogram shipment from colombia that was flown to reidsville 
ga by lehder pilots ed ward and gregory von eberstein in february 
1980 and then driven to fort lauderdale by paul alexander 
alexander testified earlier this week that he delivered the 
cocaine to a lehder employee named jackie mowerman mowerman took 
alexanders station wagon and returned three hours later in a blue 
ford mustang saying there had been problems getting the stash 
house opened alexander testified 
crawford testified thursday that the mustang rented by mowerman 
was seen in late february at the opalocka warehouse that was used 
as the stash house 
he estimated the cocaine was worth 50000 a kilogram in 1980 
this is only the second time in the cocainesmuggling trial now 
in its 15th week of testimony that the drug has been displayed in 
the courtroom in december two kilos seized from a suitcase in 
west palm beach were shown to jurors 
lehder said to be one of the leaders of the violent colombian 
medellin cartel is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine 
with intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged only with being a part of the smuggling conspiracy

american infantry and airborne forces began 
arriving in honduras today as the reagan administration said 
outnumbered contra rebels were holding out against up to 2000 
nicaraguan soldiers inside honduras 
the sandinista forces are not withdrawing at all assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams told reporters after a closed 
capitol hill briefing 
members of congress in attendance said administration officials 
had also painted a picture of more than 1000 rebels hemmed in at a 
base just inside nicaragua 
a pentagon source said the sandinistas continued to pound the 
contras inside honduras as well the source requesting anonymity 
said that the contra camps are under intense pressure 
from managua a nicaraguan foreign ministry spokesman said again 
today that his nations troops had not crossed the border and 
called on the united nations and the organization of american 
states to establish what the facts are 
and nicaraguan president daniel ortega while not confirming 
that his troops had invaded honduras told a news conference that 
he would not withdraw his forces stationed near the border until 
the us forces left honduras 
however both the democratic chairman and the republican vice 
chairman of the senate intelligence committee said after a briefing 
that reagan had little choice but to agree to honduran president 
jose azconas request for help 
the senators democrat david boren of oklahoma and republican 
william cohen of maine also agreed that the nicaraguan move was an 
staged incursion not a hot pursuit of fleeing contras 
another lawmaker who was briefed sen alan dixon dill said 
that there has clearly been a penetration by sandinista troops 
in fair numbers into honduras 
other democrats said president reagan was unjustified in his 
action had been guilty of overreaction and called the reports 
of an invasion of honduras ridiculous 
the american deployment of 3200 troops more than 100 miles 
from the fighting was the most dramatic show of us force in the 
sixyear nicaraguan war 
in managua a nicaraguan foreign ministry spokesman said again 
today that his nations troops had not crossed the border and 
called on the united nations and the organization of american 
states to establish what the facts are 
the american forces about 2000 troops in two battalions from 
the 82nd airborne division at fort bragg nc began arriving 
shortly after 11 am est at palmerola air base about 125 miles 
from the reported hostilities after a threehour flight they were 
being joined later in the day by two battalions from the 7th 
infantry divisions at fort ord calif 
the 2000 men from the 82nd airborne were excited said lt 
gen john w foss adding but i would not say they were 
nervous 
most of the men being ferried on a total of 55 transport planes 
leaving at 30minute intervals were flying directly to palmerola 
but about 800 would parachute into honduran territory about 5 miles 
away and then move toward palmerola said the commander of the 82nd 
airborne maj gen carl stiner 
accompanying the 82nd airborne troops was a giant c5 transport 
loaded with three light observation helicopters four cobra 
helicopter gunships one blackhawk helicopter a command vehicle 
and ammunition 
nicaraguan foreign ministry spokesman alejandro bendana 
interviewed from managua on the nbctv today show said 
nicaraguan forces battling the usbacked contras had reached the 
border with honduras 
theres been a cross fire and theres been fighting alongside 
the border he said adding that the operations have 
successfully been concluded and we dont plan to stay in the border 
region 
bendana said nicaragua would fly reporters to the area later in 
the day in addition he said weve called for an oasun mission 
to go to the site and let them establish what the facts are 
they can go and see for themselves he said dont take 
our word for it 
but secretary of state george p shultz appearing before the 
senate budget committee laid out this scenario 
intelligence efforts detected preparations for a nicaraguan 
drive march 9 first contact between the sandinistas and contras 
inside honduras came the next day 
on tuesday the contras reported heavy fighting and attacks 
from nicaraguan bombers inside honduras 
on wednesday we saw a presence of 1600 to 2000 sandinista 
troops in honduras aiding the nicaraguan ground forces were 
bombers and heavily armed helicopters he said 
shultz laid part of the responsibility for the contras dire 
straits on the house which last month voted not to renew aid to 
the rebels 
the decision to deny aid to the resistance has dealt them 
and in my opinion the cause of freedom a very serious blow he 
said 
but the drumbeat of democratic opposition continued 
house speaker jim wright of texas said i know of nothing that 
justifies sending troops to honduras 
sen john kerry dmass called the us move an 
overreacton adding i think the notion that theres a real 
invasion is just ridiculous 
i think its a move the president may come to regret because 
the spectacle of american troops moving into central america in 
convoy flying down there i think is going to remind the american 
people of why they dont want this 
its an overreaction said senate majority leader robert 
byrd dwva weve heard the administration cry wolf wolf 
before i dont know when theyre crying wolf 
some members of congress noted that the deployment came as the 
administration was making a renewed push for aid for the contras 
but rep lee hamilton dind interviewed on cbs this 
morning said he doubted the events would not change lawmakers 
positions 
were very evenly divided in the house and in the congress on 
aid and i dont see that fundamentally changing he said 
shultz said the united states had dispatched its troops in part 
to get peoples attention to what is happening in central 
america and to say to the honduran government we are your 
friends we stand with you 
he also told the committee its important that people know 
the united states will fight but he added that the troops are 
not there in a shooting capacity we havent been asked for that 
some congressional leaders had been briefed by telephone late 
wednesday but byrd said today he was still waiting for hard 
administration evidence to back up its statements on the nicaraguan 
troop movements 
us aid to the contras ran out two weeks ago and the 
administration is hoping the new situation will earn the contras 
greater sympathy in congress 
fitzwater said the us deployment came in response to a request 
from azcona he said reagan was briefed on the request about 8 pm 
est in his residence and decided to send in us forces

the us merchandise trade deficit widened to 
1244 billion in january the government reported thursday but 
economists said the 19 percent increase was too small to cause 
alarm 
both exports and imports fell exports by 10 percent to 2233 
billion and imports by 6 percent to 3477 billion the trade 
deficit is the difference between the two 
analysts said the export drop was expected and happens every 
january but the decline in imports was greeted as good news and a 
further indication that the trade balance is slowly improving 
the commerce department said that januarys deficit was up from 
1220 billion in december but down from those of 1321 billion 
in november and 1763 billion in october 
if the january level continued for 12 consecutive months it 
would yield an annual trade deficit of about 149 billion in 1987 
the merchandise trade deficit was 17122 billion 
there was a seasonal decline in exports which have dropped in 
january every year of this decade said commerce secretary c 
william verity there is obviously a long way to go to eliminate 
the trade deficit but we are on the right track 
private economists appeared to agree 
we tend to be very impatient and all expect dramatic 
improvements every month but the trade numbers are very time 
consuming to change said jay goldinger chief economist for 
capital insight a los angeles brokerage house its a large 
vessel and it cant move that quickly but i believe the ship 
continues to travel in the right direction 
the january report represented a slight setback after two 
consecutive monthly improvements and reclaimed some of the gains 
won from surging exports at the end of 1987 but there were some 
bright spots 
for instance the deficit with japan still the largest 
singlecountry imbalance fell by 176 percent in january to 395 
billion its lowest level since december 1986 
imports of japanese cars registered a 195 percent drop in 
january alone to 162 billion 
and the nation showed its first surplus in nearly three years 
with britain with exports overtaking imports by 75 million 
for all western europe the deficit declined 51 percent to 
133 billion 
this is the first clear evidence that we are rooting out 
imported products from japan and western europe said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist for the national association of 
manufacturers 
while disappointed by januarys export figures jasinowski said 
the trade numbers are fabulous on the import side 
a weaker dollar worth roughly 50 percent less now than it was 
three years ago against japanese and european currencies is 
credited with making us goods more competitive abroad and imports 
more costly at home 
however the deficit worsened in january with trading partners 
who have not seen the same degree of dollar devaluation against 
their currencies 
it was up 77 percent with canada to 112 billion up 20 percent 
with taiwan to 132 billion up 19 percent with south korea to 
9109 million and up 16 percent with the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries to 103 billion 
unlike many other government economic statistics the monthly 
trade figures are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations although 
they will be starting with april 
because exports always fall after the christmas season analysts 
suggested that the january figures were misleading and overstated 
the actual trade deficit 
robert ortner under secretary of commerce for economic affairs 
said that if a seasonal adjustment calculation had been applied to 
the january figures instead of showing a 235 million 
deterioration from december the figures would have shown roughly a 
1 billion improvement 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called it an 
excellent report he said that in the last three months we 
have seen a dramatic drop in the trade deficit todays report 
continues that trend 
however the aflcio argued in a statement the figures are the 
reality and no amount of theorizing can deny them the us trade 
deficit up over last month is more than enough to show that 
theres a need for a strong trade bill 
the report comes several days after the commerce department 
reported that the current account deficit an even broader measure 
of the trade balance than the merchandise figures increased in 
1987 to a record 1607 billion 
the current account deficit also includes investment flows and 
trade in services 
in another economic report on thursday the federal reserve said 
that americas factories mines and utilities operated at 824 
percent of capacity in february the same rate as in january and 
december the level for the three months is the highest operating 
rate in more than eight years

following is an excerpt from the majority opinion written by 
justice hugo black in gideon vs wainwright handed down march 18 
1963 three justices filed separate concurring opinions 
governments both state and federal quite properly spend vast 
sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of 
crime lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to 
protect the publics interest in an orderly society similarly 
there are few defendants charged with crime few indeed who fail 
to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their 
defenses 
that government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who 
have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications 
of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are 
necessities not luxuries the right of one charged with crime to 
counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials 
in some countries but it is in ours 
from the very beginning our state and national constitutions 
and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive 
safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial 
tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law 
this noble idea cannot be realized if the poor man charged with 
crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him

individuals and businesses voluntarily paid 
only 832 percent of the federal income taxes they owed last year 
leaving the government with a tax gap of 849 billion the 
internal revenue service said thursday 
more than half the shortage was attributed to individuals who 
file tax returns but fail to report income from moonlighting a 
small business or other legal nonwage sources 
irs commissioner lawrence b gibbs said closing the gap may 
require a basic change of attitude among taxpayers in much the same 
way he said that they came to consider drunken driving 
unacceptable 
i think in this country we still have an attitude that 
its socially acceptable to cut a corner here and there on taxes 
gibbs told the house ways and means oversight subcommittee 
we are going to destroy the system unless a way is found to 
ensure that everyone pays a fair share said rep jj pickle 
dtexas chairman of the subcommittee 
pickle said the irs estimate is understated even for legal 
income he noted the irs made no effort to estimate the tax loss 
from narcotics prostitution and other illegal sources of income 
as serious a problem as the 849 billion gap represents gibbs 
said there was good news 
the 1987 gap is 30 billion less than the irs forecast in 1983 
that it would be gibbs attributed the decline to new tax laws 
improved data collection lower estimates of cheating on tips and 
capital gains and a decision not to count 7 billion in taxes that 
were acknowledged but not paid 
the rate of voluntary compliance which had dropped to 811 
percent in 1986 rose last year to 832 percent virtually the same 
level as 1973 gibbs said compliance by individuals and 
corporations is expected to continue rising through 1992 but still 
remain below 85 percent 
because of a growing economy and inflation the dollar amount of 
the tax gap will keep going up gibbs said the gap which totaled 
28 billion in 1973 is expected to climb to 87 billion this year 
and almost 114 billion in 1992 
the tax gap includes money that eventually may be collected by 
irs enforcement procedures the irs collected about 475 billion in 
corporate and individual income taxes last year 
inflated wages and economic growth will offset part of the 
taxgap decline that could be expected because of tougher 
enforcement provisions enacted over the last several years as well 
as the lower tax rates and smaller number of deductions that 
resulted from the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986 
to the extent that under new law a subtraction from income 
is no longer allowed a taxpayer cannot overstate it on the tax 
return the report reasons this reduces noncompliance 
moreover because rates at which individual incomes are taxed were 
reduced the tax gap associated with any given amount of unreported 
income fell 
the biggest single cause of the tax gap is the underreporting of 
income by individuals who file returns that cost more than 48 
billion last year or almost 57 percent of the gap almost 17 
billion of that income was from nonfarm businesses conducted as 
sole proprietorships another 77 billion was attributed to such 
informal suppliers as moonlighting carpenters and roadside 
vendors 
overstatement of individual deductions accounted for 41 percent 
of the 1987 tax gap or 35 billion claiming too many personal 
exemptions cost 2 billion 
another 7 billion of the gap was blamed on people with taxable 
earnings who failed to file a return another 1 billion was lost 
to taxpayers who make mathematical errors on their returns 
individuals accounted for more than 63 billion of the gap 
corporations more than 21 billion companies with assets of 10 
million or more were responsible for threefourths of the corporate 
gap 
because of withholding and similar accounting the irs said 
individuals who file returns voluntarily report 995 percent of 
their wages and salaries 984 percent of pension income and almost 
95 percent of interest and dividends for capital gains the figure 
is 88 percent 
on the other hand roadside merchants and moonlighting craftsmen 
report only 131 percent of their earnings 
because the 1986 tax overhaul shifted 125 billion in taxes from 
individuals to corporations over five years the irs projects the 
corporate tax gap to rise from nearly 156 billion in 1986 to 31 
billion in 1992

big ike a pecan tree believed to be one 
of the worlds largest will escape a chainsaw after all its owner 
says 
it seemed i would lose big ike and i said god if theres a 
door let me find it dewayne davis on whose family farm near 
corinth the 150yearold tree stands said this week 
davis has organized a prayer and letterwriting campaign to save 
the tree which way in the way of a proposed widening of us 45 
finally a professor at mississippi state university notified him 
that a team of forestry and horticulture experts could move the 
tree to safety 50 yards away 
john d hodges a professor of forestry at mississippi state and 
a member of the team that will move the tree said chances were 
probably no better than 5050 that the tree will survive the 
move no date for it has been set 
highway departent officials determined earlier this year that it 
would cost too much for them to move the tree which is 210 inches 
around at its base 
davis who now lives in richmond va said he read a newspaper 
account earlier his week about a 200yearold magnolia in virginia 
that was being moved so he called mississippi state and told his 
story to rodney foil vice president of forestry and agriculture at 
the university in starkville 
foil agreed to recruit a team to supervise the move 
davis said fourthgraders in kossuth adopted the tree and others 
wrote letters to gov ray mabus urging him to save big ike 
youths at my church in richmond prayed and more than 150 
children have formed what we call the big ike bunch davis said 
we have a newsletter and a big ike tshirt

israel began its first major trials on 
thursday of soldiers charged with brutality in the arab rebellion 
and palestinians wounded an israeli with gunfire for the first time 
since the violence began dec 8 
israeli warplanes raided palestinian guerrilla bases in the 
mountains south of beirut and newspapers said secretary of state 
george p shultz may return to the middle east early next month to 
promote the us peace plan the raid came a day after rockets 
landed in northern israel causing light damage 
authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories 
which already include travel bans and a cutoff of telephone 
service to the outside a military official said must get approval 
to bring 1000 or more from neighboring jordan where most hold 
citizenship and have family 
the rules are intended to hamper the palestine liberation 
organization in organizing and financing the protests 
trials beginning thursday involved the burial alive of four 
arabs by an army bulldozer feb 5 in kfar salem a west bank 
village and the beating feb 24 of two palestinians near nablus 
which was photographed by a cbs news crew 
neighbors soon rescued the buried palestinians the beating was 
televised around the world and aroused international protest 
several weeks after trouble began in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as an 
alternative to firing live ammunition at least 100 palestinians 
have been killed in more than three months of violence and 
hundreds wounded 
yair nissimi and dror segencohen both army privates pleaded 
guilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior 
the plea bargain would give nissimi 2 months in jail and 
segencohel two months and both would be placed on probation 
a threejudge panel is to rule march 29 on whether to accept the 
arrangement 
sgt maj charlie danino pleaded innocent to assault and 
unbecoming conduct and is expected to argue that he was not at the 
scene 
mustafa hamdan one of those buried said of the plea bargain 
they buried four people alive if an arab did that they would 
have given him 200 years 
defense lawyer josef danai said in court the burial was an 
instance of letting off steam revenge and deterrence by soldiers 
in difficult circumstances 
we have to view this in its proper proportion he said 
after all what did they do they spilled a little earth on them 
the tractor driver said an ant could have gotten out of it 
danai said the army was sending to the occupied territories 
young boys inexperienced in life who are unable to handle 
this difficult mission sgt amichai vaturi who was at the scene 
but is not charged testified that the arabs were covered with 
about two feet of wet earth but their heads and shoulders were 
exposed 
hamdan said the heads of three men were covered 
in the beating case sagi harpaz and yehuda angel army 
privates pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed 
angels lawyer david ofek called the defendants scapegoats 
the orders to soldiers were to break arms and legs of arab 
inciters they capture he said 
two other soldiers were sentenced tuesday to 10 and 21 days in 
jail for minor roles in the beating 
in the gaza strip arabs armed with a pistol and an assault 
rifle shot 44yearold israeli contractor adi tzabaria several 
times in the legs near the jabaliya refugee camp said ilana ziv 
spokesman for barzilai hospital in ashkelon 
the army confirmed the shooting it was the first time an 
israeli civilian or soldier has been reported hit by arab gunfire 
since the beginning of what palestinians now call the uprising 
an arab truck driver in the same area tried to run down an 
israeli soldier earlier thursday but he escaped without injury the 
army said 
arab reports from jabaliya said the army fired tear gas and 
rubber bullets at 800 schoolgirls who stoned soldiers raised 
palestinian flags and burned tires 
officials of a un clinic said 25 girls were treated for minor 
injuries the camp was placed under curfew 
palestine press service an arabrun news agency said soldiers 
in the west bank arrested 150 palestinians overnight in nablus 
jenin qabitiyeh ramallah and hebron the army said it was 
investigating the report 
arab reporters said the army blocked dairy and produce 
deliveries to nablus tulkarm and jericho an army spokesmen said 
the reports were being checked

a 25year study of 1969 men has shown a 
direct link between increased cholesterol in the diet and an 
increased risk of a fatal heart attack researchers said thursday 
many previous studies have shown that too much cholesterol in 
the blood raises the risk of dying from a heart attack but this is 
the first study to show convincingly that cholesterol in the diet 
can raise blood cholesterol and in turn increase the likelihood of 
death from heart attacks researchers said 
furthermore the study may explain why the incidence of heart 
disease is falling in the united states said the studys author 
richard shekelle of the university of texas school of public health 
in houston 
the men shekelle studied workers at a western electric co 
plant in chicago had a median intake of 737 milligrams of 
cholesterol per day roughly the amount in three eggs when the 
study began 
average cholesterol consumption in americans is now about 400 or 
450 milligrams per day shekelle said 
our data are consistent with the idea that this decline in the 
intake of cholesterol over the past 25 years may have contributed 
to the observed decline in coronary heart disease shekelle said 
at an american heart association meeting 
heart association figures show a 20 percent drop in coronary 
heart disease during the last decade 
shekelles study was praised by other scientists at the meeting 
there havent been many studies showing the link between dietary 
cholesterol and mortality said suzanne haynes of the national 
cancer institute this is one of the first and its very 
important 
dwayne reed of the national heart lung and blood institute 
said we all know that serum blood cholesterol is important 
its going back that one step from serum cholesterol to dietary 
cholesterol thats been so important weve all looked at it but 
weve never found it 
shekelle said his findings made in collaboration with jeremiah 
stamler of northwestern university in chicago provide the most 
convincing demonstration so far that dietary cholesterol increases 
that risk of death from heart disease he said that several other 
studies had suggested such a link 
in shekelles study men who consumed more than 500 milligrams 
of cholesterol per day had a 22 percent higher risk of dying from a 
heart attack than did men whose cholesterol intake was low enough 
to rank them in the bottom fifth of the group 
shekelle and stamler began following the western electric 
workers in 1957 and 1958 in 1981 the researchers reported a link 
between dietary cholesterol and fatal heart attacks 
since then he said they have been combing the data to be sure 
that those men who consumed higher cholesterol did not have other 
dietary abnormalities that were contributing to the increased risk 
of fatal heart attacks 
we tried to make that association between cholesterol and 
mortality go away and we couldnt do it shekelle said 
the researchers found that the link persisted when they 
discounted the effects of known risk factors such as high blood 
pressure smoking alcohol consumption and family history of heart 
disease

iraq fired a missile into tehran and 
bombed other cities thursday and iran said it seized two iraqi 
border towns despite chemicalbomb attacks iran says the iraqi 
attacks killed 28 civilians 
the renewed missile raid followed an appeal by united nations 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar for a halt in the war 
of the cities which has raged for more than two weeks apart from 
a fragile twoday truce 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi said in tehran that the 
un security council was no more than a tool in the hands of the 
major powers 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
in istanbul two newspapers reported that premier turgut ozal 
said turkey closed its airspace to all military flights from iran 
or iraq both neighbors of turkey 
the us defense department said the 17th persian gulf convoy 
operation of the year ended thursday morning it said the 
usflagged kuwaiti tanker gas prince arrived safely off kuwait 
escorted by the guidedmissile frigate uss simpson 
the missile strike was reported by the official iraqi news 
agency which said iraq was bombarding the nest of evil the 
hideout of the charlatans because instead of accepting peace they 
have chosen the course of aggression 
iraq says it has launched 23 missiles into the iranian capital 
since sunday when the war of the cities reignited after a 
twoday truce iran has reported firing seven missiles into baghdad 
irans islamic republic news agency said 28 civilians were 
killed in the latest missile strike and in iraqi warplane raids on 
four cities both sides have reported scores of civilian casualties 
since feb 29 but neither has given an overall figure 
the agency also said iranian forces thursday fired seven 
shortrange missiles into zoubair an industrial town south of 
basra and pounded border towns along the front 
iran said its forces captured the town of dojaila which irna 
said has a population of 20000 and halabja a town of 70000 
people the towns are in sulaymaniyah province 160 miles north of 
baghdad 
the iranian agency said 2500 iraqi soldiers were killed or 
wounded in the fighting thursday it gave no breakdown of the dead 
and wounded and the figures could not be independently confirmed 
the iraqi agency quoted an unidentified spokesman as denying 
there has been any combat in the region and calling the iranian 
claims cheap lies 
tehran radio said iranian combatants had seized 300 square miles 
of iraqi territory in the region including 102 villages it said 
the prisoners included maj gen ali hussein obaid alalgawi 
described as the commander of iraqs 43rd infantry division 
the iranian agency said iraqi forces used chemical bombs against 
dojaila and halabja killing many defenseless residents it 
said the two towns were liberated under heavy bombing raids from 
the air by chemical bombs 
the staterun agency also reported without attribution that 
4000 civilian residents of halabja were killed when the town was 
hit by iraqi chemical bombs wednesday iraq did not comment on the 
claim and it could not be independently confirmed 
ozal said the ban on flying through turkeys airspace applied to 
all iranian or iraqi planes with military cargo turkey maintains 
relations with both nations and represents them in each others 
capitals 
ozal was quoted by the dailies sabah and cumhuriyet 
two iranian cargo planes and two iraqi cargo planes reportedly 
loaded with arms were denied permission to use turkish airspace a 
week ago

a 29yearold man who fell 220 feet from 
the golden gate bridge while trying to suspend himself in a trash 
can is believed to be the first person to survive an accidental 
fall from the span 
it seemed like the fall lasted forever paul alarab said 
from a hospital bed in this town about 30 miles northeast of san 
francisco i was praying for god to give me another chance 
there have been 851 known suicides from the 50yearold bridge 
and only 19 people have survived suicide attempts alarab is 
believed to be the first to survive an accidental fall 
i have been counting my blessings ever since i fell sunday 
night he said despite his two broken ribs and collapsed lungs 
the unemployed salesman said he planned to occupy a 33gallon 
barrel dangling from the bridge by a 60foot rope to protest the 
treatment of the elderly and handicapped but he slipped while 
lowering himself down the rope and hit the bottom girder of the 
bridge 
i tried to cling to the girder but i did a flip and continued 
sliding down the rope i hoped to land in the barrel but i missed 
and fell headoverheels tumbling all the way to the water he 
said 
i hit with my head and chest first i remember hitting the 
water but it knocked me out immediately i was about 20 feet 
underwater when i regained consciousness and started to swim back 
to the surface 
alarab said he felt no pain or fear theorizing the 
adrenaline and shock prevented the pain and i just thought i 
didnt want to die like this i didnt want to hurt my family 
no one spotted his plunge which he said happened about 10 pm 
sunday night authorities found only the rope and barrel dangling 
from the bridge and found a taxi driver who reported dropping a man 
off on the bridge with the equipment 
alarab said it took two hours to swim to shore through the 
strong current seven hours later shivering from the 58degree 
water he was spotted by a fishing boat and picked up by the coast 
guard 
alarab said he plans to continue his activism for senior 
citizens and handicapped but ill never put my life on the line 
again because i feel so lucky to be alive today

house speaker jim wright and some fellow 
democratic leaders on thursday criticized president reagans 
decision to send some 3200 troops to honduras as unjustified and 
potentially dangerous but others in congress said the president 
had little choice 
i know nothing that justifies sending troops said wright 
dtexas who has made himself reagans most visible congressional 
critic on central america policy some in the white house have 
been trying to do everything desperately in their power to keep 
the war going 
but a leading backer of nicaraguas contra rebels senate 
intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla said the 
president had no choice but to send us troops after the troops of 
the nicaraguas leftist sandinista government reportedly attacked 
rebel camps inside honduras 
he called the incursion a reaction to defeat of contra aid 
legislation in the house on march 3 
the sandinista government has given its answer to congress 
boren said this is their way of saying thank you very much 
you have taken the pressure off of us we think we have this won in 
washington now were going to do what weve always intended and 
crush the resistance forces 
members of congress on both sides of the divisive contra aid 
issue said the incursion and the us response would have little 
effect on prospects for a new aid package 
administration officials including secretary of state george 
shultz assistant secretary elliott abrams undersecretary for 
political affairs michael armacost and cia representatives went to 
capitol hill to brief lawmakers on the situation along the border 
but some members were withholding judgment on the 
administrations troop deployment saying there was too much 
conflicting information coming out of the region to know what is 
really happening and whether it was warranted 
it is a little hard to tell where the truth is said rep 
leon panetta dcalif 
the problem with all of this is that our policy in central 
america has been mired in deceptions and partisan confrontation 
he said i think most members are suspicious this has the 
smell of a ploy to provide military aid to the contras 
rep william broomfield rmich the senior republican on the 
house foreign affairs committee said after a briefing that the 
situation is extremely serious the longer the sandinstas stay 
in honduras the more it jeopardizes the peace process 
he said lawmakers were being told that more than 1000 contra 
troops were hemmed in by sandinista forces in the bocay region 
along the border and were in jeopardy 
the administrations actions have been very measured its 
just a psychological effect at this point broomfield said 
added rep michael dewine rohio unless congress changes its 
position quickly its over its the beginning of the end this 
was inevitable and its a real tragedy 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis also 
called the incursion serious and said he supported the troop 
deployment i believe it might do some good the name of the game 
is to get the sandinistas to back off 
house democratic leaders questioned the administrations 
handling of the entire affair saying they had continually been 
briefed or notified of developments only after the white house had 
released information to the news media and as late as a few hours 
before the decision to send troops to honduras were told no such 
action was contemplated 
we were told that the administration was reviewing its 
options but the sending of troops was not among them said house 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
what we have seen over the past week is not an attempt to 
communicate with congress or build consensus he said it is a 
public relations campaign aimed at the media to resurrect the 
failed policy of military aid for the contras 
similar comments came from sen claiborne pell dri chairman 
of the senate foreign relations committee 
i am startled by the administrations decision to dispatch 
army units to honduras particularly as there was no prior 
consultation with the congress on such a momentous act of 
escalation of the conflict in central america pell said in a 
statement 
to call hot pursuit an incursion or invasion is an 
exaggeration he said this creates a crisis atmosphere which 
some may have thought would squeeze more money out of congress for 
the contras

planeloads of us soldiers 
and supplies began arriving here thursday in a show of strength 
ordered by president reagan to counter what he called an invasion 
by nicaraguan forces 
two battalions from the 82nd airborne division of fort bragg 
nc and two battalions from the 7th light infantry division of 
fort ord calif were combined into a task force of 3000 troops 
the group planned joint exercises with honduran forces 
the deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where reagan 
administration officials say the nicaraguan sandinista army has 
chased rebel contra forces over the border into honduras 
maj gen carl w stiner commander of the 82nd airborne said 
he knew of no plan to have us troops enter into the 
sandinistacontra battle 
we have not been told to do so he said before leaving fort 
bragg he said the force was capable of that if needed 
he also said there was no plan to use the troops if more trouble 
broke out in nearby panama 
stiner said the sandinista movements did not appear to be a 
fullfledged invasion but he saw the us operation as a deterrent 
lt gen john w foss commander of the 18th airborne corps 
said it was playing with words to argue what constitutes an 
invasion it was he said useful to send a signal 
at what point does intimidation become a threat he asked 
referring to the sandinista actions 
the bulk of the troops were flown in thursday by c141 transport 
plane without any parachute operations because of high winds 
stiner said the final 800 troops would arrive friday by parachute 
weather permitting 
stiner said the 82nd airborne was put on alert for an exercise 
in honduras at 1255 pm wednesday the exercise was made public 
by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater at 10 pm but it wasnt 
until four hours later that the division received the final 
goahead 
the duration of the exercise has not been determined 
while in honduras the soldiers will train with the local army 
on mountaineering parachute and helicopter operations 
communications and other skills foss said the hondurans recently 
taught us servicemen to use mules to help with mountain 
expeditions 
in addition to the c141 aircraft a giant c5a transport was 
loaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise 
a group of reporters from washington was on the first c141 to 
arrive the reporters were part of a department of defense media 
pool that was set up following a ban on coverage of the 1983 us 
mission in grenada 
about 1150 of the troops in the honduras operation were coming 
from fort ord and the rest from fort bragg stiner said 
the news media included douglas allmond of abctv rick 
inderfurth of abctv philip mishoe of abctv otto kreisher of

us troops began arriving in 
honduras today in a dramatic show of force against nicaragua 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua vowed to liquidate the force 
the united states sent the 3200 troops from the 82nd airborne 
division and the 7th light infantry division after accusing 
nicaragua of invading honduras in pursuit of contra rebels 
col manuel suarez benavides spokesman for the honduran armed 
forces said the government and the army had given nicaragua a 
peremptory deadline of 24 hours to withdraw 2000 troops from 
honduras 
in managua capital of nicaragua president daniel ortega 
declared we are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces 
of the 82nd airborne division 
but he refused to confirm or deny if sandinista troops had 
crossed the border 
here the question is not if nicaraguan army troops 
penetrated honduran territory or not but that we have dozens of 
camps of mercenary forces in honduran territory in view of and 
tolerated by the honduran government ortega said at a news 
conference 
he called the us deployment another escalation of the war 
against nicaragua and asked for a meeting of the un security 
council 
the first planeload of us soldiers arrived at palmerola air 
base the main center of us military operations in honduras at 
1015 am a us embassy spokesman said 
palmerola is about 40 miles northwest of tegucigalpa the 
capital and about 125 miles west of where heavy fighting was 
reported wednesday 
honduran military intelligence sources said about 4000 honduran 
soldiers were still surrounding about 2000 nicaraguan troops the 
armed forces spokesman said the troops were six miles inside 
honduras 
we will not allow the sandinistas to move further into the 
interior of our territory said one honduras military source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
we want to avoid a large conflict but if it isnt possible 
we will have to face the invading troops 
the sources told the associated press that the sandinista 
soldiers had been in the border province of olancho east of 
tegucigalpa for 24 hours when honduran troops encircled them 
wednesday 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the entire 
honduran military was on alert 
the us embassy spokesman said 26 c141 planes carrying the 
3200 troops were arriving at palmerola every 30 minutes in an 
operation codenamed golden pheasant by the pentagon other 
cargo planes were carrying equipment 
in washington president spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
complete deployment would take about 27 hours the two battalions 
will conduct field exercises with honduran units 
the defense department said the soldiers were carting their 
normal weapons along with nine helicopters and two light tanks 
it was the the most dramatic show of us force in the sixyear 
nicaraguan war and came in response to a request for help from 
honduras president jose azcona hoyo 
since 1981 honduras has been a key ally for the united states 
in central america and for reagan administration policy aimed at 
containing nicaraguas government 
until early 1987 honduras was the major staging ground for 
attacks into nicaragua by the usbacked contras the rebels now 
say most of their forces are inside nicaragua 
the united states maintains about 1100 soldiers at any one time 
distributed among several military installations in honduras in 
addition other national guard and army troops rotate through for 
joint exercises and roadbuilding and other projects 
ortega did confirm that heavy fighting was under way near the 
border 
nicaraguas defense ministry denied sandinista troops entered 
honduras and alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of the foreign 
ministry repeated that denial on nbctvs today 
bendana said sandinista troops were on a routine military 
operation to push contras back into honduras and said it had been 
successfully completed bendana said sandinista troops had begun 
withdrawing from the border region and he invited the united 
nations and organization of american states to visit the area to 
see for themselves 
the intelligence sources in honduras said the sandinista troops 
apparently entered honduras late tuesday to destroy a base camp of 
the ussupplied contras for whom president reagan has been 
trying to secure continued military funding 
it was not the sovietsupplied sandinistas first reported 
incursion into honduras in march 1986 1500 nicaraguan troops 
reportedly penetrated honduran territory and us helicopters 
ferried honduran troops to the border and provided honduras 20 
million in emergency aid 
the contras have in the past maintained support bases in 
honduras but most moved their camps into nicaraguan territory last 
year 
in december 1986 honduran warplanes and artillery pounded 
sandinista troops who had entered honduras to attack contra bases 
and us army helicopters again were brought in to ferry honduran 
infantrymen to the front

intelligence reports that nicaragua had sent 
forces into honduras set in motion a flurry of activity over a 
30hour period that culminated in president reagans decision to 
send ground forces to honduras 
for the previous two weeks the administration had noted with 
alarm sandinista preparations for an offensive in the heavily 
jungled bocay valley in northern nicaragua they had begun within 
days after the feb 29 cutoff of us aid to the contras 
the administration kept quiet about the sandinista activities 
until tuesday when state department spokesman charles redman said 
the preparations foreshadowed the largest offensive we have seen 
the sandinistas undertake 
later in the day two pentagon officials who briefed reporters 
at the state department seemed to undercut redman somewhat by being 
less categorical than the spokesman about sandinista intentions 
but those discrepencies were quickly forgetten when soon after 
the briefing ended initial reports that the offensive had started 
began to reach washington as outlined by secretary of state george 
p shultz and other senior administration officials who asked not 
to be named the ensuing period was one of intense activity as the 
government decided on an appropriate response 
the magnitude of the attack surprised officials several 
thousand sandinista troops attacked contra positions on the 
nicaraguan side of the border and upwards of 1500 troops 
penetrated honduran territory they also pounded contra positions 
with heavy artillery and aeriel bombardment 
one apparent aim was the destruction of a contra military supply 
depot which the rebels consider vital to their survival another 
was to enhance the sandinista bargaining position for ceasefire 
talks with the contras that are scheduled to begin monday in a 
southern nicaraguan town 
on capitol hill there were expressions of skepticism by 
democrats about the early reports some felt that the 
administration claims were too selfserving to be taken at face 
value 
after all the administration had been trying for weeks to 
fashion a strategy for winning congressional approval for more aid 
to the contras 
hours after the initial reports of the offensive had been 
received in washington nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
confirmed them but he made no reference to a sandinista border 
crossing into honduras 
by wednesday morning about 18 hours after the first reports of 
the sandinista penetration the us ambassador to honduras 
everett briggs met with president jose azcona and discussed the 
possibility of us assistance to honduras 
azcona consulted by telephone with the presidents of guatemala 
el salvador and costa rica to tell them of his concerns he also 
called nicaraguan president daniel ortega to demand the withdrawal

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter lt col oliver l north and two arms dealers were 
ordered thursday to appear march 24 for arraignment on criminal 
charges arising from their roles in the irancontra affair 
the arraignment was scheduled by us district judge gerhard a 
gesell who will try the case brought by independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh against poindexter north and retired air force 
maj gen richard v secord and his former business partner albert 
hakim 
a lone picketer circled the us courthouse carrying signs that 
read free oliver north and hog walsh to protest the return 
wednesday of a massive indictment against the former national 
security council aide and his three codefendants 
the picketers views reflected the sentiments of two 
congressional republicans who last year investigated the sale of 
us weapons to iran and the diversion of proceeds to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
i personally think that the indictment counts are pathetic 
sen orrin hatch rutah one of the reagan administrations 
staunchest defenders during last years congressional hearings 
said during an appearance on abctvs good morning america 
i dont think that men like poindexter and north deserve 
to end up being prosecuted on criminal grounds that deal with their 
service in government rep richard cheney rwyo said on the 
nbctv today program 
rep lee hamilton dind who chaired the house irancontra 
committee defended the indictment saying it reflected many of the 
committees findings even though the panel did not say criminal 
acts were involved 
when we set out there were a number of laws that we thought 
had been broken the indictments track these findings in our 
report very carefully hamilton said 
in new orleans meanwhile david jacobsen one of three american 
hostages released as a result of the weapons shipments to iran 
opened an address to a convention of hospital administrators by 
saying he was angry that my friend terry anderson is entering his 
fourth year as a hostage 
i am also angry that oliver north who i also consider a 
friend is being held hostage by a foreign policy dispute between 
the president and congress 
anderson who is the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is one of nine american hostages being held in 
the middle east anderson was kidnapped on a west beirut street on 
march 16 1985 and is believed being held by proiranian groups in 
lebanon 
secord called the charges a creation of fantasy 
ludicrous speaking in a telephone interview he said he would 
crush the case with legal maneuvering in hopes that nobody 
else has to go through what i have 
the massive 101page indictment returned wednesday by a special 
grand jury that has investigated the case for 14 months charges 
north hakim and secord engaged in a conspiracy to circumvent a 
statutory ban on us aid to the nicaraguan rebels by setting up a 
private weapons supply network for the contras 
the alleged conspiracy which the indictment says was later 
joined by poindexter also corrupted the armsforhostage deals 
with iran by diverting more than half the 30 million generated by 
the weapons sales to foreign bank accounts controlled by hakim and 
secord the indictment said 
this money was used for other activities of the alleged 
enterprise including diversion to the contras as well as 
the personal gain of hakim secord and north the indictment 
charged 
hakim and secord were further accused of conspiring to give 
north illegal gratuities in the form of 13800 security system at 
his great falls va home and setting up a 200000 education fund 
for norths children 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral and north now assigned 
to marine headquarters are charged with obstructing congressional 
inquiries by falsely denying that north coordinated the private 
arms network 
both also are charged with obstructing the november 1986 
congressional inquiry into the arms sales to iran as the 
irancontra affair was unraveling by making false statements to the 
house and senate intelligence committees 
north is also charged obstructing the nov 2123 presidential 
inquiry by attorney general edwin meese iii by destroying and 
falsifying classified documents and making false statements to 
meeses investigators 
the indictment also alleges that poindexter deleted a file of 
all messages he sent and received in the national security 
councils computer system after a memo discussing a diversion 
was uncovered by meeses investigation 
a federal prosecutor said charges of destruction of evidence if 
proven could make it easier for walsh to get convictions 
without this element walsh might have difficulty persuading a 
jury that the defendants were guilty of an essentially political 
crime of thwarting the will of congress by raising private money 
for the contras said the prosecutor who spoke on condition of 
anonymity

the federal government on thursday moved to 
calm depositors fears and protect the nations banking system by 
advancing 1 billion to banks owned by an ailing texas holding 
company 
the federal deposit insurance corp said it was lending the 
money for six months to subsidiaries of first republicbank corp as 
an interim step toward restoring the dallasbased companys health 
ultimately the aid could rival the largestever government 
rescue of a bank the 45 billion bailout in 1984 of continental 
illinois national bank amp trust co of chicago 
and in a move intended to stem any ripple effect on the banking 
system as a whole fdic chairman l william seidman pledged his 
agency to fully protect all depositors of the banks as well as 
general creditors 
that goes beyond the minimum the agency would normally be 
expected to insure which is deposits of 100000 and less 
the promise covers money borrowed overnight from other banks by 
first republicbank to meet the cash rules of the federal reserve 
board however it does not apply to the holding company and its 
bond and note holders 
seidman said the fdic was working on a longterm solution to the 
holding companys problems and was talking to private investors 
about participating in a restructuring 
but he declined to offer specifics and said he could not 
estimate the size of any eventual rescue package private analysts 
however say a rescue of first republicbank could ultimately cost 
the government as much as 2 billion to 4 billion 
the fdic expects to recoup much of its initial outlay in the 
continental bailout ultimately spending about 17 billion 
seidman however stressed the differences between continental 
and first republicbank the chicago banks problems were attributed 
to management misjudgment and wrongdoing 
its very clear the primary reason for the first republic 
problem is the economy of texas seidman told a news conference 
he said the fdic will assume some control of the subsidiary 
banks operations although not day to day the current banks 
management will remain in place for now but changes could be 
discussed later he said the office of the comptroller of the 
currency hopes to finish an examination of the companys books 
within the next several weeks 
first republicbank the largest bank company in texas and the 
13th largest in the nation acknowledged tuesday it had been forced 
to seek federal aid because of a deteriorating loan portfolio 
particularly loans tied to commercial real estate and difficulty 
in stemming a runoff of deposits 
the holding company with 332 billion in assets and 73 
subsidiary banks reported a loss of 656 million last year 
the company has no connection with the san franciscobased first 
republic bancorp inc 
meanwhile rep fernand g st germain dri chairman of the 
house banking committee said he planned to hold hearings on the 
first republicbank package and on 970 million offered last 
september to first city bancorp of houston that transaction is 
still pending because first city bondholders have been balking at 
plans to pay them 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar 
st germain said in a statement that the committee would seek 
to determine whether better regulation and greater vigilance 
could have kept any of these institutions off the assistance 
rolls 
twentynine of republicbanks 73 subsidiaries representing 
about 80 percent of the holding companys assets are pledging 
their stock as collateral for the fdic loan and the parent company 
is guaranteeing it 
federal reserve board member manuel johnson who joined seidman 
at the news conference said first republic has been borrowing at 
the federal reserves discount window for the past several days he 
refused to say how much the bank had borrowed but did say the bank 
had pledged its loans and other assets to back up the borrowings 
the fdic reported a postdepression record of 184 bank failures 
last year 50 in texas which has been hard hit by the depressed 
energy market and the consequent bust in real estate prices 
so far this year 38 commercial banks have failed nationally 15 
of them in texas 
seidman said the first republicbank aid would not have a 
significant impact on the fdics insurance fund which finished 
1987 with 183 billion up slightly from the end of 1986 despite 
the failures 
analysts however say that cutting fdic losses by attracting 
private investors to first republicabank will be difficult 
i think its going to be tough this is a monster of a 
turnaround said paul getman senior financial analyst of the 
wefa group a philadelphiaarea consulting firm

fbi director william h webster may have been 
misinformed in 1985 when he defended continuing a terrorism 
investigation into a group opposing reagan administration policy in 
central america a congressman said thursday 
the fbis investigation of the committee in support of the 
people of el salvador was closed just two months later for lack of 
evidence 
at a congressional hearing thursday rep f james sensenbrenner 
referred to websters testimony of april 17 1985 in which the 
thenfbi director now head of the cia justified continuing the 
cispes investigation 
but the inquiry ended in june 1985 following a review by the 
justice department which concluded that cispes was involved in 
political activities involving first amendment rights and not 
international terrorism 
sensenbrenner rwis said the shutdown such a short time after 
webster supported the investigation raised the question of 
whether there was this review going on when webster made the 
statement 
the congressman said he was certain that a decision was not 
made quickly or rashly to close the terrorism investigation 
which had been going on since 1983 preceded by an earlier domestic 
criminal investigation begun in 1981 
i dont know if webster was misinformed or what 
sensenbrenner said after raising the issue with current fbi 
director william sessions at a hearing before the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
sessions confirmed his own statements of last month about the 
investigation being closed in june 1985 but said any elaboration 
would have to wait until an internal fbi review of the bureaus 
handling of the cispes inquiry is completed 
in his april 1985 testimony before the same subcommittee 
webster said we are not keeping track of the membership of cispes 
as such there are as in many organizations a wide range of 
individuals engaged in that organization including some in whom we 
have a legitimate independent foreign counterintelligence 
interest 
websters comments came in response to complaints from rep john 
conyers dmich that a member of cispes who had traveled to 
nicaragua had been interviewed by the fbi for intelligence 
gathering purposes 
telephone calls to the office of cia spokesman william baker 
who also served with webster at the fbi were not returned 
immediately 
in january the center for constitutional rights released fbi 
documents obtained under the freedom of information act showing 
that the fbi had investigated cispes extensively 
the investigation included photographing protesters at peace 
rallies and recording their licenseplate numbers investigating 
nuns union members and college students and checking up on church 
forums according to the documents 
last month sessions denied that the bureau had mounted a 
massive surveillance campaign but did acknowledge that the 
investigation was not properly directed in all instances

a forthcoming hourlong nbc television movie 
about hunger overlooks the contribution that government school 
lunch programs offer to needy families the agriculture department 
said thursday 
the network movie a place at the table is scheduled for 
broadcast the night of march 20 and focuses on children in school 
who may be hungry officials said 
dianne durant a spokeswoman for the departments food and 
nutrition service said the agencys complaint had been sent to nbc 
but that there had been no response 
curt block nbc vice president for media relations said in a 
telephone interview from new york that the purpose of the films 
producers was to take a broader focus of the problem of hunger 
among children and to get across to the public how pervasive the 
problem is 
block said the intent also was to show that there are a number 
of ways we can get food to children 
assistant secretary john w bode who oversees school lunch and 
food stamp programs said in a statement that despite the 
laudable public service aspects of the movie it contains serious 
inaccuracies about hunger 
in the movie children are encouraged to donate their brown 
bag lunches to classmates who are so hungry they attend a soup 
kitchen after school bode said the film does not acknowledge 
the existence of the national school lunch program which provides 
free school lunches to children of lowincome families 
further he said preschool breakfasts are also provided in 
schools which participate in the usda program 
school lunch is only one of a number of federal food 
assistance programs including food stamps which provide more than 
20 billion worth of help a year to needy americans bode said 
that figure translates into 56 million a day in food help 
further he said 
the school lunch program is one of the largest food service 
providers in the country serving 24 million children daily nearly 
half of whom receive lunches free of charge 
children from families with low incomes are eligible for the 
free school meals the programs current upper income limit for a 
family of four is 14560 a year 
since 1980 the federal budget for school lunches has increased 
21 percent to the current annual level of 34 billion

secretary of state george p shultz said 
thursday the 3200 us combat troops airlifted during the day to 
central america are not there in a shooting capacity but to 
signal opposition to nicaraguan aggression 
senior democrats in congress quickly questioned president 
reagans decision to send the troops with senate majority leader 
robert c byrd jr of west virginia calling it an overreaction 
officials on both sides of the issue predicted the military 
situation would reignite the controversy over contra aid that has 
divided congress for several years and there was dispute among 
lawmakers as to whether nicaragua had indeed invaded honduras the 
justification cited for the decision to send us forces 
shultz told a senate committee that the troops airlifted to 
honduras were dispatched to get peoples attention to what is 
happening in central america and to say to the honduran 
government we are your friends we stand with you 
but senior democrats challenged reagans justification for the 
action 
its an overreaction said byrd weve heard the 
administration cry wolf wolf before i dont know when theyre 
crying wolf wolf 
house speaker jim wright dtexas who has supported the peace 
plan drafted by president oscar arias of costa rica said sending 
us combat troops to the area was unjustified he voiced concern 
that the white house may have overblown the incident for its own 
purposes 
not all democrats agreed and senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas sprang to reagans defense declaring that contra rebels 
are being overrun and slaughtered by the hundreds 
he called on the president to immediately resubmit a package of 
military and logistical aid for the contra rebels and said does 
it make sense even as thousands of communist troops cross the 
border of a free country in this hemisphere for members of 
congress to make excuses for nicaraguas aggression while 
accusing the president of the united states of fueling the fires of 
war in central america 
officials of nicaraguas leftist sandinista government said 
their troops were not in honduras but the administration said it 
dispatched us forces at the request of honduran president jose 
azcona officials said they received the request because sandinista 
forces were in honduras threatening to overrun contra bases 
the contras have been battling the managua government for 
several years with the support of the reagan administration but 
us aid to them expired at the end of february and the house 
refused to renew it 
shultz took note of that as he appeared before the senate budget 
committee obviously the decision in the house of representatives 
to deny aid to the resistance has dealt them and in my opinion 
tha cause of freedom a very serious blow he said 
shultz said the us troops from the armys 82nd airborne and 
7th light infantry divisions arent in honduras in a shooting 
capacity 
it is important for people to know the united states will 
fight but we dont plan to get involved in any military way he 
said 
shultz said that as of wednesday there were 1600 to 2000 
nicaraguan soldiers across the honduran border he said there had 
been heavy fighting that two airfields had been seized and that 
the sandinistas had spearheaded their attacks on contra forces with 
airplane and helicopter strikes 
shultz noting that nicaraguan president daniel ortega had 
issued a denial of troop presence in honduras on wednesday said 
wright had told him he had been called by the nicaraguan foreign 
minister and told that the sandinista troops would be withdrawn 
underscoring the apparent contradiction shultz said i dont 
know which one is lying maybe both 
not all democrats objected to reagans decision to dispatch 
troops 
sen alan dixon dill said after a classified briefing that 
there has clearly been a penetration by sandinista troops in 
fair numbers into honduras 
shultz laid out this scenario 
intelligence efforts detected preparations for a nicaraguan 
offensive drive beginning on march 1 
first contact between the sandinistas and contras inside 
honduras came on march 10 
on tuesday the contras reported heavy fighting and attacks 
from nicaraguan bombers inside honduras 
on wednesday we saw a presence of 1600 to 2000 sandinista 
troops in honduras aided by bombers and helicopters 
the democratic chairman and republican vice chairman of the 
senate intelligence committee said after an administration briefing 
that reagan had no choice but to dispatch the troops 
after listening to representatives of the intelligence agencies 
and assistant secretary of state elliott abrams sen david boren 
dokla and william cohen rmaine agreed that a planned 
incursion had taken place not a hot pursuit of contra forces 
boren saying the contras are outnumbered three or four to 
one told reporters the sandinistas are reading the tea leaves 
in congress and taking a riverboat gamble that they can deliver 
a crushing blow this was a reaction of the sandinista government 
to the defeat of contra aid 
the sandinista government has given its answer to congress 
this is their way of saying thank you very much you have taken 
the pressure off of us we think we have this won in washington 
now were going to do what we always intended to do and crush the 
resistance forces 
cohen said the administration is responding to a request for 
political support from honduras at this point 
but sen john kerry dmass said i think the notion that 
theres a real invasion is just ridiculous 
some members of congress noted that the deployment came as the 
administration was making a renewed push for aid for the contras 
rep lee hamilton dind said he doubted whether the outcome 
will be changed 
were very evenly divided in the house and in the congress on 
aid and i dont see that fundamentally changing he said

three people were killed and 68 wounded by a protestant gunman who 
attacked a graveside service for three irish republican army 
members in belfast 
mayor raymond l flynn of boston said the root of the violence 
was the utter despair that british rule has perpetrated 
throughout the occupied six counties 
what can we expect but senseless and renewed violence from 
both communities when the british government itself has abandoned 
a code of law enforcement for a shoottokill policy aimed at 
unarmed citizens said flynn 
in an emotional homily before his citys parade new yorks 
cardinal john j oconnor proposed a pilgrimage to ireland to pray 
for peace with justice 
i would like to feel exuberant i would like to feel joyful 
oconnor told a congregation of about 2000 i dont feel that 
way today i dont feel like reviewing a parade i suspect many of 
you dont feel like marching in a parade 
the parade went on however with oconnor adding heavy black 
gloves to his vestments to protect against a blustery wind 
organizers estimated that 125 million people crowded fifth avenue 
to watch the parade but police reported little of the drunken 
rowdiness which has marked past holidays 
christine bittinger 78 was walking up fifth avenue for two 
reasons im walking for justice in northern ireland and because

knights of st patric dinner traditionally a must gathering for

more than 200000 people crowded the sidewalk in downtown 
chicago to watch the 40000 marchers 50 floats and 45 bands that 
made up the annual parade portions of the chicago river were dyed 
green for the annual day of revelry they make much more of it 
here than in ireland said bridgid donnelly 19 an irish citizen 
living in chicago 
there were few mentions of belfast in chicago where parade 
organizers strived for a holiday mood 
even the grits were green as 300000 people braved unseasonable 
30degree temperatures to see the 164th st patricks day parade in

mockery of democracy during the primary voters were required to 
line up behind candidates or their agents and beyond charged that 
some voters were intimidated by administration officials into 
voting for certain candidates

young families trying to purchase their first 
home and lowincome families struggling to meet escalating rental 
payments are two groups which have suffered the most from flawed 
housing policies in the 1980s according to a new study released 
thursday 
america is increasingly becoming a nation of housing haves and 
havenots said h james brown one of the authors of the report 
and the director of the joint center for housing studies at harvard 
university while a majority of americans are wellhoused too 
many americans have not been able to share in this prosperity 
the report titled the state of the nations housing 
contended that the number of americans unable to secure decent and 
affordable housing was growing at an alarming rate among its 
findings 
since 1981 rental costs including utilities have risen 14 
percent faster than prices generally after adjusting for 
inflation rental costs are now at their highest level in two 
decades 
the steep increase in rental costs means that singleparent 
households must devote 584 percent of their incomes to rent 
compared to 349 percent in 1974 
homeownership rates have fallen steadily during this decade 
particularly among young people in 1980 433 percent of 
households in the 2429 age group owned their own home a figure 
that has now declined to 359 percent 
the aftertax cost of buying a typical first home in 1987 was 
7449 or 324 percent of the average annual income of potential 
firsttime buyers about 50 percent higher than the share of income 
required in the early 1970s 
the study which was financed by a grant from the ford 
foundation and several housing trade groups did not make any 
recommendations for needed changes in government policy 
the reagan administration has been criticized in the past for 
its efforts to scale back federal housing assistance programs but 
brown said it was important to realize that the countrys housing 
problems were a result of a number of forces which have been at 
work well before the current administration took office 
in reacting to the report carl d covitz undersecretary of the 
department of housing and urban development said that the 
administration was proud of its efforts in the past seven years to 
boost housing subsidies to lowincome families but realized much 
more needs to be done 
its never been easy for the typical family to buy their first 
home or for very lowincome people to afford decent housing and the 
harvard study performs a valuable service by pointing up some of 
the very real problems still faced by many american families 
covitz said in a statement 
william apgar another author of the report said that one 
particular problem was that even minimal federal housing assistance 
was reaching only one in four families in need 
only one in four rentor households with incomes at or below 
the poverty level live in public housing or receive some other form 
of federal housing assistance apgar said

a citizens group upset over congressional 
action to rename a lake after sen strom thurmond presented the 
south carolina republican with petitions signed by 42000 people 
thursday urging that the original name be restored 
but thurmond refused to become involved in the controversy after 
meeting privately for 35 minutes with representatives of the group 
and with south carolina legislators supporting the name change to 
honor thurmond 
thurmond declined to answer questions as he left the meeting at 
his capitol office referring them to his press secretary 
christopher simpson 
he told them he feels the matter is settled and since he did 
not instigate it or push for it he feels it would be inappropriate 
for him to get involved now simpson said 
the dispute over the name of the army corps of engineersbuilt 
clarks hill lake which straddles the south carolinageorgia 
border began in december which congress acting quickly and with 
no public hearings enacted legislation changing the name of the 
lake dam and road to strom thurmond 
roy giles a lincolnton ga restaurant owner and one of the 
leaders of the citizens group said the petitions propose a 
compromise that would restore the name of the lake to clarks hill 
but would retain the new strom thurmond name for the dam and road 
rep doug barnard dga has introduced legislation paterned 
after the compromise which giles said would permit thurmond to 
have his monument and the people will have their lake back 
south carolina state sen john drummond of greenwood said the 
legislators told the citizens group that it would be an 
embarrassment for thurmond to ask the whole congress and the 
president to reverse what theyve done 
drummond said he told the group the two states need to work 
together to save that lake not the name because the low water 
level in the lake is threatening its recreational potential 
giles said the name change will result in financial losses for 
businesses that have built their reputations using the clarks hill 
name and he vowed that the group will continue its fight even 
without thurmonds help

the chamber of commerce has apologized to the 
rev joseph lowery for including stories profiling civil rights 
activists on a list of potentially negative stories journalists 
might write during the democratic national convention 
chamber president jerry bartels had received complaints on 
lowerys behalf after reports that chamber officials regarded the 
president of the southern christian leadership conference as a 
public relations liability 
a chamber official said wednesday the group made a mistake in 
putting the subject of profiles of civil rights activists on a list 
of potentially negative news stories about atlanta 
barry king the chambers vice president for communication said 
lists of positive and negative potential media topics were 
drafted to help the chamber prepare to respond to reporters 
questions during the convention this july 
the lists appeared in the chambers newsletter last month the 
atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution subsequently reported 
that chamber officials considered lowery among the negative 
news figures 
negative subjects on the chambers list include ku klux klan 
activity nude dance clubs and textbook banning on the positive 
list were southern hospitality the book and movie gone with the 
wind and atlantas fortune 500 companies 
following the news reports bartels wrote lowery saying the 
chamber considers him a positive force in atlanta no other letters 
were sent king said because there were no other questions about 
the chambers views on a specific civil rights figure 
however lowery said tuesday that he didnt consider the letter 
an apology what he never did explain was how profiles of civil 
rights leaders get in a negative category he said 
we never mentioned the names of anybody on any of these 
lists king said he said he regretted that positive and 
negative labels were used 
many of the stories he said could turn out to be flattering or 
derogatory depending on how they were written a story about civil 
rights might be negative he said because the overall record of 
achievement could be questioned 
if reporters ask about civil rights leaders he said we would 
simply put them in touch with the civil rights leaders

israel began its first major trials on 
thursday of soldiers charged with brutality in the arab rebellion 
and palestinians wounded an israeli with gunfire for the first time 
since the violence began dec 8 
israeli warplanes raided palestinian guerrilla bases in the 
mountains south of beirut and newspapers said secretary of state 
george p shultz may return to the middle east early next month to 
promote the us peace plan the raid came a day after rockets 
landed in northern israel causing light damage 
authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories 
which already include travel bans and a cutoff of telephone 
service to the outside a military official said palestinians must 
get approval to bring 1000 or more from neighboring jordan where 
most hold citizenship and have family 
the rules are intended to hamper the palestine liberation 
organization in organizing and financing the protests 
trials beginning thursday involved the burial alive of four 
arabs by an army bulldozer feb 5 in kfar salem a west bank 
village and the beating feb 24 of two palestinians near nablus 
which was photographed by a cbs news crew 
neighbors soon rescued the buried palestinians the beating was 
televised around the world and aroused international protest 
several weeks after trouble began in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as an 
alternative to firing live ammunition at least 100 palestinians 
have been killed in more than three months of violence and 
hundreds wounded 
yair nissimi and dror segencohen both army privates pleaded 
guilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior 
the plea bargain would give nissimi 2 months in jail and 
segencohel two months and both would be placed on probation 
a threejudge panel is to rule march 29 on whether to accept the 
arrangement 
sgt maj charlie danino pleaded innocent to assault and 
unbecoming conduct and is expected to argue that he was not at the 
scene 
mustafa hamdan one of those buried said of the plea bargain 
they buried four people alive if an arab did that they would 
have given him 200 years 
defense lawyer josef danai said in court the burial was an 
instance of letting off steam revenge and deterrence by soldiers 
in difficult circumstances 
they spilled a little earth on them he said the tractor 
driver said an ant could have gotten out of it 
sgt amichai vaturi who was at the scene but is not charged 
testified that the arabs were covered with about two feet of wet 
earth but their heads and shoulders were exposed 
hamdan said the heads of three men were covered 
in the beating case sagi harpaz and yehuda angel army 
privates pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed 
two other soldiers were sentenced tuesday to 10 and 21 days in 
jail for minor roles in the beating 
in the gaza strip a 25yearold khan yunis resident subhi abu 
sharar was shot in the chest and seriously wounded said ilana 
ziv spokeswoman for barzilai hospital in ashkelon 
arab reports said israeli soldiers shot him during a 
demonstration 
also in gaza two arabs shot 44yearold israeli contractor adi 
tzabari four times in the legs near jabalia refugee camp ms ziv 
said 
tzabari told israel army radio i threw a hammer at one arab 
with a pistol then another one appeared with a kalashnikov 
assault rifle and opened fire 
the army confirmed the shooting it was the first time an 
israeli civilian or soldier has been reported hit by arab gunfire 
since the beginning of what palestinians now call the uprising 
an arab truck driver in the same area tried to run down an 
israeli soldier earlier thursday but the soldier escaped without 
injury the army said 
arab reports from jabaliya said the army fired tear gas and 
rubber bullets at 800 schoolgirls who stoned soldiers raised 
palestinian flags and burned tires 
officials of a un clinic said 25 girls were treated for minor 
injuries palestine press service an arabrun news agency said 
soldiers in the west bank arrested 150 palestinians overnight in 
nablus jenin qabitiyeh ramallah and hebron 
arab reporters said the army blocked dairy and produce 
deliveries to nablus tulkarm and jericho 
the army said these reports were being checked

president francesco cossiga on wednesday asked 
ciriaco de mita leader of the dominant christian democrats to try 
to form italys 48th government since world war ii 
de mita 60 indicated he would seek to put together a coalition 
of the same five parties that have governed off and on since 1981 
christian democrats socialists republicans social democrats and 
liberals 
cossiga named de mita premierdesignate after three days of 
consultations with political leaders following premier giovanni 
gorias resignation goria a christian democrat stepped down 
friday after 7 turbulent months in office 
de mita told reporters at quirinal palace after meeting cossiga 
that he would open negotiations friday with the other parties 
he said the christian democrats want solidarity among the same 
five parties of the coalition 
the key to de mitas chances will be support of the socialists 
the no 2 party in the coalition socialist leader bettino craxi 
said wednesday he did not object to de mitas candidacy but that 
his support would depend on the program outlined 
among divisive issues facing de mita is italys nuclear policy 
a government decision last week to resume construction of a nuclear 
power plant near rome angered the socialists and helped force goria 
to resign 
also in dispute is the fate of the secret vote in parliament 
the socialists want the secret vote abolished 
the baldpated de mita was elected in 1982 as secretary of the 
christian democrats a post many consider the most powerful 
political position in italy 
de mita son of a tailor was born in nusco a small hill town 
near naples he entered politics in the 1950s after earning a law 
degree he was elected to parliament in 1963 and has held his seat 
since then serving as a minister in several governments in the 
1970s 
political commentators and cartoonists often poke fun at de 
mitas thick southern accent he and his wife anna maria have four 
children

the presidential candidates who made it 
through the costly super tuesday and illinois contests are now 
lining up fundraising events to see them through the rest of the 
primary season 
some of the most cashdraining states are yet to come new 
york pennsylvania california and ohio 
vice president george bush has no money worries and gop rival 
pat robertson has already shelled out nearly all he can legally 
spend but the democrats continue hunting for cash for their 
generally lighter treasuries and republican sen bob dole is also 
seeking contributions 
sen paul simon of illinois and rep richard gephardt of 
missouri both are scrimping along looking to draw enough 
contributions to keep their campaigns afloat beyond caucuses on 
march 26 in michigan and primaries march 29 in connecticut and 
april 5 in wisconsin 
the democratic money leader massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
has an active april fundraising schedule and remains in good 
financial shape a spokesman said 
democrat jesse jackson whose fundraising has trailed that of 
opponents has been picking up money through an aggressive mail 
program and will appeal for money in california this weekend 
aides to sen albert gore jr of tennessee did not return calls 
thursday to discuss his financial picture 
bushs schedule includes a handful of dinners and receptions 
through april and then he can close up his fundraising shop that 
is because he will have brought in as much as he can spend on his 
primary campaign under election law rules said campaign treasurer 
fred bush who is no relation to the candidate 
the limit is 27 million and the campaign figures on another 2 
million or so for legal and accounting costs which are exempt from 
the limit 
money has been pouring into the bush coffers as he heads to 
allbutcertain nomination this summer 
the vice presidents push down the fundraising home stretch 
included a 1000aperson dinner thursday night in washington for 
which 170 people were signed up and another two dozen had to be 
turned away said the campaign treasurer 
in addition to the events bush will mail one more appeal to his 
70000 or so donors who have not yet maxed out with the 1000 
maximum contribution they are allowed to give 
bush currently has more than 4 million in cash on hand 
spokeswoman ede holiday said thursday although he has nearly 
raised the limit he can continue campaigning because he has not 
spent it all 
in a different situation is gop rival robertson the former tv 
evangelist who must drastically scale back his campaign operation 
to avoid exceeding the spending limit 
robertson has said he will rely heavily on volunteer efforts to 
see him through the rest of the campaign 
dale tate a spokeswoman for sen dole of kansas said that after 
doles poor showing on super tuesday and in illinois receipts had 
not fallen off precipitously 
in fact she said people have been calling unsolicited to 
pledge money and urge him not to drop out 
these are republicans saying we think there should be a 
race she said 
on friday callers pledged 140000 on monday 95000 and on 
tuesday 60000 she said still she added were not bathing in 
dollars and no decisions on tv advertising have been made for 
the campaigns next targeted state wisconsin 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said the campaign raised 100000 
wednesday night in new york and is focusing on raising money for 
the new york and pennsylvania primaries dukakis strong showing in 
the 20state super tuesday contests on march 8 has kept money 
flowing to him he said 
dukakis has about 15 million in the bank not counting the 
more than 600000 he got this week in federal matching funds said 
spokesman leslie dach 
for simon and gephardt both of whom did poorly in the super 
tuesday races the situation was not so bright although both said 
they were not in debt 
both also said they had record fundraising months in february 
gephardt collecting 12 million and simon more than 900000 a 
simon spokesman conceded march will not be a record for us as 
february was 
its a daytoday thing said gephardts spokesman mark 
johnson were using aggressive fundraising techniques mostly 
involving phone calls to contributors youre at a point now 
where cash flow is very important and you need a quick 
turnaround he said 
gephardt is is targeting michigan for a heavy advertising 
campaign but johnson said he has no idea whether any loans will be 
taken out 
simon spokesman david carle said that after paying off remaining 
bank debt thursday the campaign had around 300000 in cash on 
hand simon has scaled back his operation laying off about 15 
people at the campaign headquarters on the heels of more than 250 
layoffs after the iowa new hampshire and super tuesday contests 
carle said 
simon collected about 60000 at a chicago event monday night 
and expected to bring in another 25000 thursday night in new york 
a mailing to simons 50000 contributors will go out next week 
and unsolicited donations came in following simons victory in his 
home state of illinois carle said he declined to give specific 
figures 
simon will strongly contest wisconsin with a large tv campaign 
but will not buy ads in michigan he said

fbi director william h webster may have been 
misinformed in 1985 when he defended continuing a terrorism 
investigation into a group opposing reagan administration policy in 
central america a congressman said thursday 
the fbis investigation of the committee in support of the 
people of el salvador was closed just two months later for lack of 
evidence 
at a congressional hearing thursday rep f james sensenbrenner 
referred to websters testimony of april 17 1985 in which the 
thenfbi director now head of the cia justified continuing the 
cispes investigation 
but the inquiry ended in june 1985 following a review by the 
justice department which concluded that cispes was involved in 
political activities involving first amendment rights and not 
international terrorism 
sensenbrenner rwis said the shutdown such a short time after 
webster supported the investigation raised the question of 
whether there was this review going on when webster made the 
statement 
the congressman said he was certain that a decision was not 
made quickly or rashly to close the terrorism investigation 
which had been going on since 1983 preceded by an earlier domestic 
criminal investigation begun in 1981 
i dont know if webster was misinformed or what 
sensenbrenner said after raising the issue with current fbi 
director william sessions at a hearing before the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
sessions confirmed his own statements of last month about the 
investigation being closed in june 1985 but said any elaboration 
would have to wait until an internal fbi review of the bureaus 
handling of the cispes inquiry is completed 
in his april 1985 testimony before the same subcommittee 
webster said we are not keeping track of the membership of cispes 
as such there are as in many organizations a wide range of 
individuals engaged in that organization including some in whom we 
have a legitimate independent foreign counterintelligence 
interest 
websters comments came in response to complaints from rep john 
conyers dmich that a member of cispes who had traveled to 
nicaragua had been interviewed by the fbi for intelligence 
gathering purposes 
after thursdays hearing cia spokesman william baker who also 
served with webster at the fbi noted that justice department 
reviews of such probes take place annually and that goaheads for 
the cispes investigation had been given twice previously based on 
a valid predication that there was a conspiracy to commit 
terrorist acts 
the investigation was based on circumstantial evidence which 
the fbi was unable to document that cispes members were sending 
money to the farabundo marti liberation front the main insurgent 
group trying to overthrow the government of el salvador 
in january the center for constitutional rights released fbi 
documents obtained under the freedom of information act showing 
that the fbi had investigated cispes extensively 
the investigation included photographing protesters at peace 
rallies and recording their licenseplate numbers investigating 
nuns union members and college students and checking up on church 
forums according to the documents 
last month sessions denied that the bureau had mounted a 
massive surveillance campaign but did acknowledge that the 
investigation was not properly directed in all instances

warplanes believed to be from honduras 
attacked a sandinista military headquarters in northern nicaragua 
near the honduran border the presidential spokesman said thursday 
manuel espinoza enriquez said the attack on bocay caused no 
injuries or damage sandinista troops fired on the planes forcing 
them to turn back to honduras he said 
he said the planes fired at least five rockets at the 
headquarters but did not say if any struck their target 
the attack came a day after honduras charged that nicaraguan 
troops had entered its territory while pursuing usbacked contra 
rebels 
president daniel ortega said thursday that nicaragua was ready 
to combat and liquidate american troops sent to honduras after 
the reported incursion he said his soldiers wont withdraw from 
the border region 
ortega also called for a meeting of the un security council to 
deal with what he called one more escalation of the war against 
nicaragua 
we logically are going to maintain our offensive we are 
not going to withdraw our troops now that we have recovered our 
territory he said 
we are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 
82nd airborne division he said 
earlier a foreign ministry spokesman said nicaragua already had 
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about 
2000 contra rebels back into honduras 
the operations have succesfully been concluded and we dont 
plan to stay along the border region in fact this deescalation 
has already begun the spokesman alejandro bendana said on 
nbcs today show 
ortega spoke to reporters before meeting with 14 opposition 
parties to explain to them the national and international 
situation 
the 3200 us troops that began arriving in honduras on 
thursday include two battalions from the 82nd airborne at fort 
bragg nc 
ortega called the us troop movement a dangerous act and 
accused the united states of pressuring honduras into asking for 
the american presence 
the c141 planes carrying the us troops were arriving every 30 
minutes at palmerola air force base the main center of us 
military operations in honduras the base is about 125 miles west 
of the border where heavy fighting was reported wednesday 
bendana denied us and honduran allegations that sandinista 
troops entered honduras and he invited the united nations and 
organization of american states to visit the area to establish 
what the facts are and end these accusations 
ortega himself wouldnt say if sandinista troops crossed the 
border 
here the question is not if nicaraguan army troops 
penetrated honduran tserritory or not but that we have dozens of 
camps of mercenary forces in honduran territory in view of and 
tolerated by the honduran government he said 
but honduran military officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said about 4000 honduran soldiers were surrounding 
about 2000 nicaraguan soldiers thursday the sources said the 
entire honduran military was on alert 
ortega told reporters the nicaraguan invasion only exists in 
the warped imagination of the north american leaders and said the 
sending of american troops violates international law and the 
regional peace efforts he added 
we demand that the united states withdraw its troops from 
honduras immediately and with this contribute to the meeting that 
is going to be held in sapoa march 21 having positive results he 
said 
government and contra representatives are scheduled to begin 
three days of peace talks monday in sapoa a town in southern 
nicaragua near the border with costa rica 
ortega said the united states would use the current situation to 
give the contras logistical and military aid not approved by 
congress 
at the united nations the nicaraguan mission confirmed that the 
government plans to ask for a meeting of the 15member security 
council the highest un body 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuella called for 
restraint in the conflicts but had not decided whether to send in 
an observer team

five current or former school bus drivers 
were among seven people arrested in an investigation into drug 
dealing and marijuana use officials said wednesday 
more arrests are expected 
the problem was so great we decided not to end this 
operation said officer wayne hoskins of the departments drug 
enforcement unit to me this is one of the biggest things weve 
done these guys were driving busloads of kids around that bothers 
me as a citizen not just a cop my kids have rode those buses 
hoskins said officer harold robinson posed as a bus driver to 
gather evidence robinson made a drug buy within a week of being 
hired jan 8 police said 
he let it be known he was looking and it went down that 
quick hoskins said its really unbelieveable how bad it was 
were talking about a lot of people involved in drugs down there 
linda ethridge president of the waco independent school 
district board said the police investigation was prompted by a 
school district request 
she said the wisd conducts background checks on those hired as 
bus drivers but that sometimes those reviews fall short there are 
about 150 drivers in the district 
board members have in the past discussed whether to start 
drugtesting of drivers and will likely take up the matter in the 
future she said 
jafus cavil vice president of the school board said he doubted 
if the board could establish a drugtesting policy because i 
think there are some legal problems to it 
federal agents arrested the current and former drivers monday 
and tuesday the three current drivers were fired 
hoskins said police monitored the drivers suspected of using 
drugs to ensure they were capable of driving 
the undercover officer found both marijuana and cocaine sold and 
used at the bus barn before morning routes hoskins said

a group of antiapartheid activists called on 
the south african government wednesday to commute the death 
sentences of six blacks who were involved in a 1984 demonstration 
during which a black deputy mayor was killed 
molly yard president of the national organization for women and 
a member of the free south africa committee said the government of 
prime minister pw botha was using the death penalty in an effort 
to intimidate the countrys black protest movement 
she likened such tactics to those of nazi germany contending 
that the pretoria government is on the road to totally 
obliterating all blacks except those who accept slavery 
secretary of state george p shultz telephoned south african 
foreign minister roelof pik botha to protest the plans to execute 
the six department spokesman charles e redman said 
a protest also was delivered to the south african government by 
us diplomats in pretoria 
as the president said yesterday we do hope that the south 
african government will heed this call for clemency redman said 
speaking at a news conference yard urged congress to approve 
stronger sanctions and require total withdrawal of american 
business interests from south africa 
now was joined at the session by representatives from 
transafrica the washington lawyers committee for civil rights and 
the national conference of black lawyers as well as aides to 
presidental candidate sen paul simon dill and rep mervyn 
dymally dcalif chairman of the congressional black caucus 
the groups praised the reagan administration for joining the 
british and west german governments in asking for clemency in a 
telegram to botha 
at the same time they urged president reagan to end diplomatic 
relations with south africa and ask the western allies to join in a 
trade embargo 
weve seen what this government can do against poland and 
panama yard said why not south africa 
the south african prisoners known as the sharpeville six were 
convicted in the sept 3 1984 killing of black township councilor 
jacob dlamini in sharpeville about 40 miles south of johannesburg 
evidence at their trial indicated that the six were not among 
those who hacked and burned dlamini to death they were convicted 
under the doctrine of common purpose which holds that they 
were responsible for the killing by being part of the mob that 
gathered outside of dlaminis home with intent to kill him 
michael prosper of the lawyers committee told the news 
conference that dlamini who refused to leave his home when south 
african police tried to take him to safety had incited violence by 
firing several shots into the crowd 
the plea for clemency also is supported by amnesty 
international the united auto workers the national coalition 
against the death penalty the national council of churches and

christian lacroix scored a solid success in his 
first readytowear show wednesday keeping hemlines short and 
flirty 
his show capped the first day of a big week for buyers and press 
who come to view what paris has to say about next winters clothes 
the consensus is that many influential designers plan to keep their 
skirts short others will set hemlines zooming down 
paris wonderboy lacroix was most successful in his daytime 
clothes his lateday dresses were inspired by moroccan folklore 
and the dance hall a departure from the arlesienne look of 
previous collections 
he had hinted he would show very simple clothes but couldnt 
resist some occasional fantasy and his offerings were anything but 
dull 
the show started with a bang hotcolored coats in all shapes 
from swirly trapeze to fitted often with big fichu collars the 
little suits in houndstooth checks or plaids with fitted jackets or 
tiny boleros were geared more to daily life then some of the 
costumey lines in his couture collections 
simplicity however took away none of the pizazz of these 
outfits which are priced ultramoderately compared to his luxe 
or couture lines made for him by genny of italy the readytowear 
ensembles are expected to sell for about 420 to 1060 
top sellers in this collection may be the fabulous silk jacquard 
fullskirted coatdresses in coral yellow and blue 
lacroix was ebullient with a funandgames approach in hats 
such as an animalspotted stovepipe or tipped pyramids to go with 
little satin beribboned ballerina shoes 
he went in for some of his favorite full taffeta babydoll 
dresses with bows or pyramid shapes his fluid black jersey 
waistless or fitted dresses with asymmetrical hemlines topped by 
dresses with big white organza collars might appeal as well to 
those with conservative tastes 
the fancier numbers included some ribbed sweaters with 
embroidered net tops over flying bright skirts there were merry 
widow dresses too complete with musichall tights that had lace 
and garter effects under the full bouncy skirts 
in a circus vein he branched out into some loud and crazy 
patchwork dresses with woolen balls and ribbons 
the dressier silk or velvet outfits with moroccan jewelry and 
lace embroidery did not come off as well in this collection as the 
beautifully finished simpler clothes but the audience loved it all 
anyway and gave him a big hand for his peppy approach 
in contrast to lacroixs exuberance lolita lempickas 
collection featuring mannish suits was downtoearth to the point 
of boredom 
in greys and black pinstripes with ties the outfits had long 
pleated or short lean skirts some of the jackets fitted other 
spencerstyle for office chic more mannish looks featured 
trousers making a comeback 
streamlined long and loose princess coat dresses were winning in 
sober silvery grey black or brown light wools 
the satin and lace evening looks made an attempt at gaiety with 
their bubbling scalloped skirts but they didnt quite hit the 
mark and lace sleeves on mantailored jackets over knit knickers 
were not quite successful in their androgynous aim for a 
masculinefeminine line 
doby broda went in for sweaters on more sweaters a pullover 
vneck topped by a cardigan with a shoulder shrug sometimes over 
cuffed long or pedalpusher pants her skirt lengths in lowkey 
outfits of mauve beige or violet were either well above the knee 
or nearly to the ankle 
kimijimas venetian carnival show was all in good fun 
especially the evening wear with huge peplumed bright taffeta 
skirts some harlequinmotif underskirts and embroidered fitted 
tops 
chantal thomass known as queen of lingerie toned down 
some of her risque touches in a bright appealing show featuring 
lots of pink angora and black stockings with vinelike motifs up 
the front 
her wrapped tops over very short lean or bubbled skirts were 
offset by some anklelength numbers often in soft pastel knits 
equally appealing here might be the long and full cuffed pants and 
the coats either full trapeze style or in sober charcoal and 
white stripes fitted like short redingotes

peoples republic of china federal agents arrested three men in 
san francisco in connection with a 7pound heroin shipment from 
china to the united states tucked away inside dead goldfish the 
drug enforcement administration said wednesday 
the goldfish were laden with southeast asian heroin which was 
sewn inside condoms said dea spokesman cornelius dougherty boxes 
of fish containing the heroin and bound for a business called the 
goldfish aquarium in san francisco were spotted by authorities in 
china on march 9 
dea and us customs service agents were alerted and authorities 
seized the heroin in china 
most of the heroin was later resewn inside some of the fish 
which were placed in the bottom of each of 20 boxes containing 50 
to 60 live goldfish and shipped to the united states aboard an 
aircraft a shanghai police official and a dea agent from hong kong 
accompanied the shipment to san francisco 
the boxes were deposited in a cargo area and attached with 
transponders emitting a signal so that dea and customs agents could 
keep the boxes under electronic surveillance

to the aquarium where they were opened by three people then 
arrested by agents who had trailed them to the location the three 
were arrested last friday in addition four people were arrested 
in china in connection with the shipment 
the dea said it was the first time the united states and 
mainland china had worked together on a controlled delivery of

the house budget committee approved a 11 
trillion federal budget for the 1989 fiscal year thursday that 
obeys congress budget summit accord with president reagan but 
scrambles some of his domestic spending priorities 
the spending plan would leave a deficit of 1341 billion 
according to the budget panel enough to avoid automatic spending 
cuts under the grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
the budget resolution expected to be sent to the full house 
next week was pieced together over the last several days during 
closeddoor meetings among committee republicans and democrats the 
panel approved the document on a voice vote with no objections 
during a fiveminute public session 
weve had a bipartisan process with full participation by 
republican members said committee chairman william h gray iii 
the bipartisan camaraderie was in stark contrast to last year 
when republicans walked away from the budget resolution process and 
bickering lasted for months 
but the budget pact reached last november between reagan and 
lawmakers locked in new taxes and spending levels for fiscal 1988 
and 1989 for defense foreign affairs and overall domestic spending 
lawmakers are proving eager to avoid reopening those questions 
and sparking potentially bitter fights in an election year thus 
the main fight remaining has been over how to distribute the 1692 
billion the summit allows for the domestic programs that congress 
directly oversees and are not financed under automatic formulas 
the key was the budget summit which gave us the key ceilings 
for the spending categories which are usually most controversial 
said rep willis d gradison jr of ohio senior committee 
republican at the meeting 
in the 1989 budget he presented congress feb 18 reagan 
proposed a 20 percent increase in spending on space and science 
programs to 131 billion the budget panel looking to restore 
proposed cuts to several other domestic programs pared that 
increase to 122 billion 
the committee felt that was a realistic figure for nasa to 
carry out its mission gray said 
where reagan proposed deep cuts in programs such as mass transit 
assistance and eliminating other programs such as federal aid to 
amtrak the passenger railroad the budget committee would retain 
current levels of spending or reduce it by 1 percent or 2 percent 
for programs for lowincome people such as job training and 
child health care the budget panels proposal would allow enough 
of a spending increase to keep up with inflation expected to reach 
4 percent this year 
the committees budget also rejects 12 billion in savings in 
medicare that reagan had proposed spends 15 billion for aids 
research slightly more than the president proposed and retains 
previously planned levels of spending for education fighting drugs 
and providing aid to the homeless 
the panel also proposed a 3 percent pay raise for federal 
workers and civilian employees of the military gray said lawmakers 
will have to decide later this year whether members of congress 
would qualify for the salary increases 
the committees budget leaves intact the summit agreement 
spending levels of 294 billion for military programs for the 1989 
fiscal year and 14 billion in new taxes most of the levies are 
on corporations 
the senate plans to write its budget resolution next month the 
resolution does not need the presidents signature and it serves 
as a blueprint for actual spending legislation to be enacted later 
the lawmakers chose the path of least political resistance in 
selecting the crucial economic assumptions that determine how 
healthy the governments balance sheet will appear 
thus to weigh the budget deficit the lawmakers adopted the 
economic assumptions used by the presidents office of management 
and budget the committee chose not to use economic figures 
calculated by the congressional budget office which has said red 
ink is actually 35 billion greater than omb estimates 
under grammrudman the deficit target for next year is 136 
billion the law states that spending would be automatically cut to 
that level if the deficit exceeds the target by 10 billion 
the 1989 fiscal year begins oct 1

the presidential candidates who made it 
through the costly super tuesday and illinois contests are now 
lining up fundraising events to see them through the rest of the 
primary season 
some of the most cashdraining states are yet to come new 
york pennsylvania california and ohio 
vice president george bush has no money worries and gop rival 
pat robertson has already shelled out nearly all he can legally 
spend but the democrats continue hunting for cash for their 
generally lighter treasuries and republican sen bob dole is also 
seeking contributions 
sen paul simon of illinois and rep richard gephardt of 
missouri both are scrimping along looking to draw enough 
contributions to keep their campaigns afloat beyond caucuses on 
march 26 in michigan and primaries march 29 in connecticut and 
april 5 in wisconsin 
the democratic money leader massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
has an active april fundraising schedule and remains in good 
financial shape a spokesman said 
democrat jesse jackson whose fundraising has trailed that of 
opponents has been picking up money through an aggressive mail 
program and will appeal for money in california this weekend 
arlie schardt a spokesman for sen albert gore jr said the 
campaign was in the black and had a sufficient amount of 
money to do what we need to do 
were in good solid shape he said but refused to provide 
any details 
bushs schedule includes a handful of dinners and receptions 
through april and then he can close up his fundraising shop that 
is because he will have brought in as much as he can spend on his 
primary campaign under election law rules said campaign treasurer 
fred bush who is no relation to the candidate 
the limit is 27 million and the campaign figures on another 2 
million or so for legal and accounting costs which are exempt from 
the limit 
money has been pouring into the bush coffers as he heads to 
allbutcertain nomination this summer 
the vice presidents push down the fundraising home stretch 
included a 1000aperson dinner thursday night in washington for 
which 170 people were signed up and another two dozen had to be 
turned away said the campaign treasurer 
in addition to the events bush will mail one more appeal to his 
70000 or so donors who have not yet maxed out with the 1000 
maximum contribution they are allowed to give 
bush currently has more than 4 million in cash on hand 
spokeswoman ede holiday said thursday although he has nearly 
raised the limit he can continue campaigning because he has not 
spent it all 
in a different situation is gop rival robertson the former tv 
evangelist who must drastically scale back his campaign operation 
to avoid exceeding the spending limit 
robertson has said he will rely heavily on volunteer efforts to 
see him through the rest of the campaign 
dale tate a spokeswoman for sen dole of kansas said that after 
doles poor showing on super tuesday and in illinois receipts had 
not fallen off precipitously 
in fact she said people have been calling unsolicited to 
pledge money and urge him not to drop out 
these are republicans saying we think there should be a 
race she said 
on friday callers pledged 140000 on monday 95000 and on 
tuesday 60000 she said still she added were not bathing in 
dollars and no decisions on tv advertising have been made for 
the campaigns next targeted state wisconsin 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said the campaign raised 100000 
wednesday night in new york and is focusing on raising money for 
the new york and pennsylvania primaries dukakis strong showing in 
the 20state super tuesday contests on march 8 has kept money 
flowing to him he said 
dukakis has about 15 million in the bank not counting the 
more than 600000 he got this week in federal matching funds said 
spokesman leslie dach 
for simon and gephardt both of whom did poorly in the super 
tuesday races the situation was not so bright although both said 
they were not in debt 
both also said they had record fundraising months in february 
gephardt collecting 12 million and simon more than 900000 a 
simon spokesman conceded march will not be a record for us as 
february was 
its a daytoday thing said gephardts spokesman mark 
johnson were using aggressive fundraising techniques mostly 
involving phone calls to contributors youre at a point now 
where cash flow is very important and you need a quick 
turnaround he said 
gephardt is is targeting michigan for a heavy advertising 
campaign but johnson said he has no idea whether any loans will be 
taken out 
simon spokesman david carle said that after paying off remaining 
bank debt thursday the campaign had around 300000 in cash on 
hand simon has scaled back his operation laying off about 15 
people at the campaign headquarters on the heels of more than 250 
layoffs after the iowa new hampshire and super tuesday contests 
carle said 
simon collected about 60000 at a chicago event monday night 
and expected to bring in another 25000 thursday night in new york 
a mailing to simons 50000 contributors will go out next week

10day mark 
i think it can be done and id like to be the one to do it

41 minutes a record for the races longer northern route from 
anchorage to nome

winning time of 11 days 2 hours set a record for the shorter 
southern route

israel began its first major trials on 
thursday of soldiers charged with brutality in the arab rebellion 
and palestinians wounded an israeli with gunfire for the first time 
since the violence began dec 8 
israeli warplanes raided palestinian guerrilla bases in the 
mountains south of beirut and newspapers said secretary of state 
george p shultz may return to the middle east early next month to 
promote the us peace plan the raid came a day after rockets 
landed in northern israel causing light damage 
authorities increased restrictions in the occupied territories 
which already include travel bans and a cutoff of telephone 
service to the outside a military official said palestinians must 
get approval to bring 1000 or more from neighboring jordan where 
most hold citizenship and have family 
the rules are intended to hamper the palestine liberation 
organization in organizing and financing the protests 
trials beginning thursday involved the burial alive of four 
arabs by an army bulldozer feb 5 in kfar salem a west bank 
village and the beating feb 24 of two palestinians near nablus 
which was photographed by a cbs news crew 
neighbors soon rescued the buried palestinians the beating was 
televised around the world and aroused international protest 
several weeks after trouble began in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip the army introduced a policy of beating rioters as an 
alternative to firing live ammunition at least 100 palestinians 
have been killed in more than three months of violence and 
hundreds wounded 
yair nissimi and dror segencohen both army privates pleaded 
guilty in the burial case to reduced charges of shameful behavior 
the plea bargain would give nissimi 2 months in jail and 
segencohen two months and both would be placed on probation 
a threejudge panel is to rule march 29 on whether to accept the 
arrangement 
sgt maj charlie danino pleaded innocent to assault and 
unbecoming conduct and is expected to argue that he was not at the 
scene 
mustafa hamdan one of those buried said of the plea bargain 
they buried four people alive if an arab did that they would 
have given him 200 years 
defense lawyer josef danai said in court the burial was an 
instance of letting off steam revenge and deterrence by soldiers 
in difficult circumstances 
they spilled a little earth on them he said the tractor 
driver said an ant could have gotten out of it 
sgt amichai vaturi who was at the scene but is not charged 
testified that the arabs were covered with about two feet of wet 
earth but their heads and shoulders were exposed 
hamdan said the heads of three men were covered 
in the beating case sagi harpaz and yehuda angel army 
privates pleaded innocent to assault and the case was recessed 
two other soldiers were sentenced tuesday to 10 and 21 days in

planeloads of us soldiers 
streamed into this air base thursday in a show of strength ordered 
by president reagan to counter what he called an invasion by 
nicaraguan forces 
in northern nicaragua warplanes raided a sandinista military 
headquarters thursday but no casualties or damage resulted 
nicaragua said a reagan administration source speaking on 
condition of anonymity confirmed in washington that honduras 
launched the raid but called it totally a honduran operation 
two battalions from the renowned 82nd airborne division of fort 
bragg nc and two battalions from the 7th light infantry 
division of fort ord calif were combined into a task force of 
3000 troops 
a honduran official said his government had given the 
sandinistas 24 hours to get out of the country which they entered 
in pursuit of contra rebels 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua responded that his army was 
ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 82nd 
airborne division 
maj gen carl w stiner commander of the 82nd airborne said 
he knew of no plan to have us troops enter into the battle 
between the sandinistas and the usbacked contras 
we have not been told to do so he said before leaving fort 
bragg he said the force was capable of that if needed 
the american troops were to engage in joint exercises with the 
hondurans 
stiner also said there was no plan to use the troops if more 
trouble broke out in nearby panama 
the american forces began arriving at palmerola at 1015 am as 
part of what the pentagon called operation golden pheasant 
the 26 c141 transport planes landed in the intense heat at 
30minute intervals at this air base headquarters of us military 
operations in honduras 40 miles northwest of tegucigalpa 
the deployment was about 125 miles west of the area where reagan 
administration officials say the nicaraguan sandinista army has 
chased rebel contra forces over the border into honduras 
col manuel suarez benavides honduran armed forces spokesman 
said the deadline for the sandinistas to leave was final 
he said 2000 nicaraguan soldiers had crossed the border and 
penetrated about six miles in pursuit of contra rebels a military 
intelligence source said earlier the nicaraguans were surrounded by 
about 4000 honduran troopers 
suarez benavides would not comment on pentagon reports of new 
nicaraguan attacks inside honduras 
the sandinista movements did not appear to be a fullfledged 
invasion stiner said adding that he saw the us operation as a 
deterrent 
ortega would not say whether his soldiers had crossed the border 
in pursuit of the ussupported rebels 
here the question is not if army troops penetrated honduran 
territory or not but that we have dozens of camps of mercenary 
forces in honduran territory in view of and tolerated by the 
honduran government he said at a news conference in managua 
he said nicaraguan soldiers would not withdraw from the border 
area ortega called the us troop deployment a dangerous act 
and another escalation of the war against nicaragua he 
demanded a meeting of the un security council 
a spokesman for the nicaraguan foreign ministry said before the 
news conference that nicaragua had begun pulling its troops back 
from the frontier region after driving about 2000 contra rebels 
back into honduras the defense and foreign ministries denied that 
nicaraguan troops entered honduras 
nicaraguan presidential spokesman manuel espinoza enriquez later 
said that air attackers fired at least five rockets thursday at the 
nicaraguan military headquarters at bocay near the honduras 
border sandinista gunfire forced the planes to turn back he said 
the us official in washington said two honduran air force f5s 
and four supermystere attack jets carried out the assault 
destroying a sovietbuilt helicopter on the ground 
heavy fighting was reported wednesday in the olancho border 
province about 125 miles east of palmerola 
included in the american forces are two battalions from the 82nd 
airborne and two from a new division organized for quick movement 
around the world the 82nd airborne and 7th light infantry are 
based at opposite ends of the country 
the final 800 us troops are to arrive friday by parachute 
weather permitting 
in addition to the c141 aircraft a giant c5a transport was 
loaded with helicopter gunships for the exercise 
the honduran intelligence source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said we will not allow the sandinistas to move 
farther into the interior of our territory we want to avoid a 
large conflict but if it isnt possible we will have to face the 
invading troops 
secretary of state george p shultz said in washington the 
soldiers were not being sent in a shooting capacity but to 
get peoples attention to what is happening in central america 
and say to the honduran government we are your friends 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the complete 
deployment would take about 27 hours the defense department said 
the soldiers had their normal weapons along with nine helicopters 
and two light tanks 
it was the the most dramatic show of us force since the 
contras began fighting in nicaragua six years ago and came in 
response to a request for help from president jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras 
since 1981 honduras has been a key us ally in central america 
and a major element in reagan administration policy of fighting 
nicaraguas leftist government 
about 1100 american soldiers normally are stationed at several 
military installations in honduras in addition other national 
guard and army troops rotate through for joint exercises 
roadbuilding and other projects

a house committee chairman called wednesday 
for the resignation of a highranking education department official 
who was quoted in a published report as saying students at black 
colleges include a high level of thieves 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee said the remarks by deputy undersecretary 
bruce carnes make him incapable of objectively carrying out his 
duties he is not qualified for this or any position in federal 
government 
in a story tuesday about a crackdown on student loan defaults 
the wall street journal quoted carnes as saying the sector that 
will be hit hardest by this will be black colleges its possible 
that their student bodies contain a high level of thieves 
but carnes said in a statement that i have no recollection of 
saying that or anything remotely like that its completely at 
variance with everything i have said before on this topic and with 
what i believe 
gary putka the reporter who wrote the story said he has 
carnes comment in his written notes and stands by the quote he 
hasnt denied it to us nor has he asked us for a correction or 
retraction putka said 
in a letter to the journal dated tuesday carnes said the 
newspaper article has grievously misrepresented my views 
concerning black colleges and their students in fact it ascribes 
to me a view that is precisely the opposite of the one i hold and 
have repeatedly stated 
education department spokesman loye miller said the letter did 
not demand a retraction because the newspaper would have refused to 
publish it that way 
hawkins called on education secretary william bennett to remove 
carnes from his position if carnes did not resign hawkins also 
said he had written to president reagan about the incident 
miller said carnes has repeatedly said he does not believe 
stiffer penalties and enforcement in the area of student loan 
defaults will be a special problem for historically black colleges 
miller also said he has heard carnes rebuff people who say such 
colleges need an exemption from the default crackdown because their 
students are less reliable about paying back loans 
in his letter to the journal carnes said students at 
historically black colleges are as capable as others of meeting 
their commitments he said the department is holding workshops 
and seminars to help historically black colleges with high default 
rates manage their student loans

democratic presidential contenders debated longdistance with 
republican bob dole thursday over the dispatch of us troops to 
central america with richard gephardt charging the administration 
had abandoned the rule of law 
dole called for us military help for the nicaraguan contra 
rebels who he said were being slaughtered by the hundreds 
but jesse jackson campaigning in michigan said we are being 
told we have to be saved from the sandinistas there are no 
sandinistas in detroit 
jackson also included vice president george bush the gop 
presidential frontrunner in his verbal attack commenting one day 
after former white house aide oliver north and three other men were 
indicted for their roles in the irancontra money diversion 
jackson said in a real sense the mailmen have taken the rap for 
the postmaster 
north and the others are fall guys in the process this 
investigation must conclude the fact that this is president 
reagans policy and the fact that mr bush knew about the scheme 
he said 
sen paul simon said of the troop deployment im skeptical 
like a lot of my colleagues i dont know what i can trust from the 
administration 
massachusetts gov dukakis not only criticized the 
administrations central american moves but also laid into bush for 
refusing to break with reagan over a civil rights bill the 
president vetoed on wednesday 
reagan has complained the bill would expand federal power and 
he has offered a substitute but dukakis said theres a very 
basic principle involved here that is that institutions which 
receive money from the government should not discriminate 
bush spokesman pete teeley said the vice president has not 
publicly discussed his views of the issue and he said were not 
going to respond to dukakis 
dukakis meanwhile made the rounds on capitol hill on thursday 
picking up the endorsements of several lawmakers sen barbara 
mikulski of maryland sen patrick leahy of vermont and sen donald 
riegle and rep howard wolpe both of michigan 
pat robertson still in the gop race but apparently making only 
a token effort the rest of the way was hoping to bring in needed 
cash at a california fundraiser 
bush and dukakis had fundraising events on their schedules 
too and so did illinois democratic primary winner simon as the 
candidates took advantage of a primary season lull to catch their 
breath and pick up campaign money for the series of bigstate 
primaries next month 
dukakis praised democratic national chairman paul kirk and new 
york gov mario cuomo for their recent comments against deciding 
the partys nominee at a brokered convention as simon has said is 
inevitable and in favor of settling the matter beforehand 
dukakis paraded new endorsements from two senators whose states 
have already voted barbara mikulski of maryland and patrick leahy 
of maine and sought support from two others bill bradley of new 
jersey and donald riegle of michigan 
the massachusetts governor also compared himself to former vice 
president walter mondale who lost the general election in a 
landslide to reagan after a tough fight to win the nomination in 
1984 
this is a long process dukakis said of his wins and losses 
in primaries so far mondale in 84 lost a whole string of 
primaries and pulled it out numerically with new jersey if 
theres one campaign thats doing it primary by primary caucus by 
caucus its this campaign 
gephardt was campaigning hard in michigan ahead of march 26 
caucuses there the missouri congressman who fell far behind 
dukakis sen albert gore and simon on super tuesday is traveling 
the state in a bus while his 80yearold mother loreen has been 
making the rounds of radio talk shows in detroit 
gore was on the campaign trail too but was having weather 
problems in kansas where democratic caucuses will be held saturday 
the tennessee senator who bypassed the years leadoff contests 
in iowa and new hampshire got a taste thursday of the cold snowy 
campaigning he missed in those states he greeted workers arriving 
at a boeing plant in wichita which had been hit by latewinter 
snow and his next stop in pittsburg kan was canceled because 
the airport there had no deicing equipment 
gore in a news conference later in topeka was less critical 
than several of his democratic rivals of the reagan 
administrations sending of troops to honduras but he did say i 
think it was wrong to mislead the congress and fail to provide the 
information about what led up to the decision 
he also said i think the president erred in not virgorously 
pursuing a peace plan offered by the president of costa rica 
dole in a speech on the senate floor declared that the 
nicaraguan contra rebels were being overrun and slaughtered by 
the hundreds and he said reagan should immediately resubmit a 
request for military aid 
does it make sense even as thousands of communist troops 
cross the border of a free country in this hemisphere for members 
of congress to make excuses for nicaraguas aggression while 
accusing the president of the united states of fueling the fires of 
war in central america dole asked 
gephardt however in a statement released by his office in 
washington strongly criticized reagan for sending troops to 
honduras 
now we have this overreaction that puts american troops in 
harms way he said this exercise serves no purpose but to 
draw us into a war that the american people oppose 
gephardt said in pursuit of its failed policy of support for 
the contras the administration has lost its sense of direction 
abandoned the rule of law and failed to protect american national 
interests in a troubled region 
dukakis said to reporters in boston that the decision to send 
troops was very regrettable

the army announced wednesday it had decided to 
begin purchasing a specialized west german military reconnaissance 
vehicle rather than continue development of its own 
the decision ultimately could be worth 790 million to west 
germany and demonstrates the us commitment to nato 
standardization and cooperation the army said 
the decision involves a unique type of wheeled reconnaissance 
vehicle outfitted for use in a battle zone contaminated by either 
nuclear radioactivity or biological and chemical agents 
the west german version of the vehicle is known as the 
abcspuerpanzer fuchs and is made by thyssen henschel of 
kassel west germany the us army calls the german vehicle the 
fox nbc reconnaissance vehicle 
the fox wheeled vehicle has been in service with german forces 
since 1979 the army said a version of it has been recently 
fielded as a reconnaissance vehicle with imbedded nuclear and 
chemical detection warning and navigation equipment 
the army will adopt this vehicle terminating funding 
for the xm87 nbc reconnaissance vehicle program 
maj randy morger a pentagon spokesman said the army intended 
to purchase six of the fox vehicles in the near future for about 1 
million each in order to perform final acceptance tests 
ultimately the service may spend about 790 million to acquire 
576 of the vehicles that pricetag would include adding some 
additional sensor data processing and radio equipment to the 
vehicle morger said

planes from honduras attacked a 
sandinista military headquarters in northern nicaragua at noon 
thursday but president daniel ortegas office said they caused no 
casualties or damage 
reporters on the scene confirmed the raid which came the day 
after honduras accused the nicaraguans of sending thousands of 
soldiers across the border in pursuit of ussupported contra 
rebels 
a reagan administration source in washington said the honduran 
air force had carried out the attack however a honduran armed 
forces spokesman in tegucigalpa the capital denied the armed 
forces had crossed into nicaragua and said rockets were fired at 
sandinista forces in honduran territory 
more than 3000 american soldiers began arriving in honduras in 
a show of support thursday ortega declared his army ready to 
combat and liquidate the americans and said his soldiers will 
not withdraw from the border region 
nicaragua has committed an estimated 6000 soldiers to an 
antirebel operation in an area running from the central region to 
the border with most of them at the frontier 
manuel espinoza enriquez spokesman for ortega said the attack 
on bocay near the border caused no injuries or damage he said 
nicaraguan soldiers fired on the planes forcing them to turn back 
at least five rockets were fired at the headquarters he said 
but did not say whether any hit the target 
the us official in washington said two usbuilt f5s and 
four supermystere attack jets of the honduran air force carried 
out the assault destroying one of nicaraguas sovietmade 
helicopters on the ground 
this was totally a honduran operation the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
honduras has one of central americas smallest armies and relies 
on air superiority for defense it and mexico are the only nations 
in the region with jet fighters 
manuel suarez the honduran armed forces spokesman said in a 
telephone interview that the air force dropped at least five bombs 
inside honduras along the border region near bocay he said he had 
no further information 
ortega called the dispatch of us troops to honduras one more 
escalation of the war against nicaragua and demanded a meeting of 
the un security council 
a council meeting thursday about british military maneuvers in 
the falkland islands became an impromptu debate of the us action 
with barbs exchanged by nicaragua and panama on one side and the 
united states on the other 
in managua ortega said we logically are going to maintain 
our offensive we are not going to withdraw our troops now that 
we have recovered our territory 
we are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the 
82nd airborne division 
earlier a foreign ministry spokesman said nicaragua already had 
begun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about 
2000 contra rebels back into honduras 
the operations have succesfully been concluded and we dont 
plan to stay along the border region in fact this deescalation 
has already begun the spokesman alejandro bendana said on 
nbcs today show 
ortega spoke to reporters before meeting with 14 opposition 
parties to explain to them the national and international 
situation 
the 3200 us soldiers who began arriving in honduras on 
thursday include two battalions from the 82nd airborne at fort 
bragg nc 
ortega accused the united states of pressuring honduras into 
asking for the american presence 
the c141 planes carrying the us troops were arriving every 30 
minutes at palmerola air force base the main center of us 
military operations in honduras the base is about 125 miles west 
of the border where heavy fighting was reported wednesday 
bendana denied us and honduran allegations that sandinista 
troops entered honduras and he invited the united nations and 
organization of american states to visit the area to establish 
what the facts are and end these accusations 
ortega himself wouldnt say if sandinista troops crossed the 
border 
here the question is not if nicaraguan army troops 
penetrated honduran tserritory or not but that we have dozens of 
camps of mercenary forces in honduran territory in view of and 
tolerated by the honduran government he said 
but honduran military officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said about 4000 honduran soldiers were surrounding 
about 2000 nicaraguan soldiers thursday the sources said the 
entire honduran military was on alert 
ortega told reporters the nicaraguan invasion only exists in 
the warped imagination of the north american leaders 
we demand that the united states withdraw its troops from 
honduras immediately and with this contribute to the meeting that 
is going to be held in sapoa march 21 having positive results he 
said 
government and contra representatives are scheduled to begin 
three days of peace talks monday in sapoa a town in southern 
nicaragua near the border with costa rica 
ortega said the united states would use the current situation to 
give the contras logistical and military aid not approved by 
congress 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuella called for 
restraint in the conflict but had not decided whether to send in an 
observer team

the interior department said wednesday a 
proposed 358mile northeast natural gas pipeline is unacceptable 
because its route across the appalachian trail would create scenic 
and environmental problems 
but the project developer vowed to work with federal park 
officials to find a new route across the hiking trail that would be 
acceptable 
interior secretary donald p hodel in a letter to sen lowell 
p weicker jr rconn said he rejected the iroquois proposal 
because the pipeline would cross the 2000mile appalachian trail 
at a point in new york near the connecticut border where it would 
have significant environmental and scenic impacts 
gary b davis spokesman for the iroquois gas transmission 
system said he was confident the company could find a route across 
the trail that would satisfy hodel 
the plan now is to find a place along the new yorkconnecticut 
border where we can cross davis said we will have to sit down 
with the park service again and discuss our concern something 
will have to be worked out 
the pipeline which would begin in ontario would have to cross 
the appalachian trail at some point on any route to long island 
because the trail runs from maine to georgia the pipeline would 
serve connecticut new york and new jersey 
the 384 million project is the first and most prominent 
northeast gas line proposal under consideration by the federal 
energy regulatory commission 
but deputy assistant interior secretary susan recce said the 
us park service which is under the interior department has 
jurisdiction over anything affecting the appalachian trail which 
is part of the national park system 
hodels ruling was based on the recommendation of a park service 
survey in january 
the pipeline would have crossed the appalachian trail at dover 
ny in eastern dutchess county ny near sherman conn davis 
said that site was chosen becaue atampt telephone lines already cut 
across the trail there 
meanwhile the federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday 
took its first procedural step in reviewing the applications of 31 
northeast projects iroquois was the first application submitted 
nearly two years ago 
its important because a procedure is now moving forward 
davis said after 22 months finally ferc is starting to take 
some action on our application 
the licensing consideration is going ahead under traditional 
ferc guidelines 
iroquois had pushed to have the project considered under a 
fasttrack procedure that would have avoided a series of 
lengthy hearings but that attempt opposed by weicker and other 
officials in connecticut has been in effect been abandoned by the 
company davis said 
opponents argued that the fasttrack procedure was designed for 
smaller projects

portauprince haiti ap the government of president leslie 
manigat vowed wednesday to crack down on narcotics trafficking but 
made no specific mention of the us indictment of col jeanclaude 
paul on drug charges 
a communique signed by martial celestin the prime minister and 
minister of justice and by foreign affairs minister gerard 
latortue declared 
the government reiterates its determination to struggle 
against drug trafficking and confirms its desire to cooperate 
with foreign governments in the struggle against drug trafficking 
in which haiti could be used as a point of transit 
in any precise case implicating an individual or institution 
the government would appreciate receiving a complete file 
solidly documented with evidence which would be transferred to 
judicial authorities 
a federal grand jury in miami on march 9 indicted paul his 
brother and pauls former wife in connection with a 220pound 
shipment of cocaine allegedly flown to the bahamas in a plane that 
left pauls ranch outside the capital portauprince the cocaine 
was said to be floridabound 
paul a battalion commander in portauprince denied the 
charges and haitian officials said they never were officially 
notified of the indictment 
us embassy spokesman jeffrey lite however said ambassador

hundreds of british troops took off 
wednesday night on an 8000mile practice airlift to reinforce the 
remote falklands islands garrison in the south atlantic 
the first of up to 10 transport planes carrying 900 troops 
departed at about 10 pm from brize norton royal air force base 
60 miles northwest of london said a defense ministry spokesman 
who was not identified in keeping with british custom 
it was part of britains controversial fire focus military 
exercise which marks britains first major drill in the falklands 
since it won a 1982 war with argentina over the islands the 25day 
exercise began march 7 
phantom fighter jets and other planes will fly in from other 
british bases royal air force spokesman michael hill said 
argentina backed by other latin american nations has called 
the 690 million troop movement aggravating britain insisted 
it is defensive 
in the falklands gen neil carlier told reporters at mount 
pleasant airport it is much cheaper to mount an exercise like 
this than to hold a vast number of people down here at taxpayers 
expense which might also perhaps send out the wrong signals 
carlier called the nature of the exercise misunderstood and said 
the airlift was needed because weve just set up in a new base 
and not yet had the opportunity to prove the system for having 
reinforcements 
the 2000 troops stationed on the south atlantic archipelago 
were placed in a state of high readiness to prepare for the arrival 
of the reinforcements thursday and friday he said 
the reinforcements will include troops taking the role of the 
enemy advance personnel equipment and reporters arrived tuesday 
britain built the airport after the 1982 war to accommodate 
widebodied jets which could be used to rush troops there in the 
event of a buildup of tension in the region 
in 1982 argentine forces invaded the islands lack of a 
suitable runway forced britain to form a naval task force that took 
weeks to reach the islands 
britain recaptured the colony after a 74day conflict which 
killed 712 argentines 255 britons and three falkland islands 
civilians 
argentina 200 miles west of the islands claims it inherited 
the falklands from spanish colonial days and that they were stolen 
by britain which has ruled them as a colony since 1833 
the 1900 islanders most of british descent say they prefer 
british rule 
this month the organization of american states voted 250 to 
urge britain to reconsider the exercise the united states and st 
lucia a former british colony abstained

a federal energy official said wednesday the 
planned superconducting super collider is generating widespread 
interest abroad but several lawmakers said the project is 
threatened by a lack of financing and firm commitments from 
interested foreign countries 
james f decker the energy departments acting director for 
energy research told a house subcommittee that the government 
hopes to get up to 40 percent of the estimated 43 billion cost 
from foreign and nonfederal sources 
decker said recent energy department missions to rome paris 
london bonn geneva tokyo and ottawa found high interest in the 
project at every stop with indications that financial support will 
be forthcoming 
the discussions with japan and other countries were fairly 
significant and give us reason to believe there will be 
contributions decker said at a hearing of the house subcommittee 
on international scientific cooperation 
asked repeatedly about specific commitments decker said it was 
premature to obtain them 
all countries were interested in the scientific phase and some 
would contribute to the construction phase as well decker said 
predicting that contributions would be in goods and services rather 
than cash 
potential contributor nations will be watching support in 
congress this year and your decision will guide theirs decker 
said 
that prompted rep robert a roe dnj to describe financing 
as a chicken and egg situation since congress is waiting to see 
how much outside money will be contributed 
its a catch22 predicament in which the department says it 
cant get foreign money until domestic spending for ssc is 
approved and we respond that we cant permit domestic spending 
until enough foreign money has been committed said rep sherwood 
boehlert rny 
weve got to have some help from other countries said roe 
chairman of the full science space and technology committee 
the government is spending 25 million on super collider 
preparations this year and has requested 363 million for 1989 
rep ron packard rcalif said he has found in talks abroad 
that theoretical physicists were highly enthusiastic about the us 
project and ready to lobby for financial support of it with the 
lessenthusiatic officials of their governments and research 
institutions

warships attacked three vietnamese freighters near disputed islands 
in the south china sea then blocked rescue efforts 
china blamed vietnam for the raid and said some chinese were 
wounded in the exchange of gunfire foreign ministry spokeswoman li 
jihua refused to say how many people were hurt

china taiwan and the philippines 
the vietnamese side sent lifeboats flying red cross flags to 
rescue those freighters but they were obstructed by chinese 
warships said the vietnamese broadcast monitored in bangkok

warships to move away from this area and not to prevent the 
vietnamese ships from coming to the rescue of the crews on these 
freighters the vietnamese side wishes a favorable and early reply 
from the chinese side it added 
the radio said vietnams foreign ministry made the charges in a 
meeting wednesday with li shuching beijings ambassador to hanoi 
vietnam said the clash began when three chinese warships opened 
fire without provocation on two vietnamese freighters the warships 
then fired on other vietnamese freighters that came to the rescue 
the radio said 
but ms li of chinas foreign ministry said vietnamese naval 
ships fired on chinese vessels and on teams doing a scientific 
survey on a reef 
ms li refused to disclose how many chinese were wounded 
whether they were civilians or military personnel or other details 
vietnam had charged that chinese naval vessels interferred with 
vietnamese cargo ships near the archipelago on jan 31 
there are believed to be oil deposits near the archipelago 
about 300 miles south of chinas hainan island 
china was a major arms supplier to the vietnamese communists 
during the war against the french and the americans but relations 
later deteriorated and the two countries fought a 17day border war 
in 1979

association 
in a statement on lius expulsion the party charged that he 
confounded right and wrong and spread slanderous rumors

favoring of western ideas that began after student demonstrations 
in support of democracy flared across china 
astrophysicist fang lizhi accused of inciting the student

of being a soviet spy and a traitor sent to a labor camp and 
forbidden to speak to his family for four years 
he was quoted as saying it was the worst period in his life and 
only the thought that no one would know the truth prevented him 
from committing suicide 
liu was rehabilitated in 1979 and joined the staff of the 
peoples daily 
that same year he published his most famous work between men 
and monsters about a county party secretary who amassed a 
fortune by taking bribes and using her power to extort money from 
subordinates

guatemala called wednesday for a 
meeting of central american foreign ministers to discuss crises in 
nicaragua and panama but the planned session fell through 
officials in costa rica said 
a costa rican foreign ministry official who spoke on condition 
he not be identified did not say why the talks could not be 
arranged 
he said guatemalas foreign ministry had called for the meeting 
of the five countries that signed a peace accord last august 
the ministers were to discuss ways to mediate a solution to the 
panama crisis in which opposition forces and the united states are 
pressing for the ouster of gen manuel antonio noriega head of the 
defense forces

offensive against contra rebels on the countrys border with 
honduras the official said honduran officials and the reagan 
administration said the sandinistas crossed into the neighboring 
country during the offensive 
rodrigo madrigal nieto costa ricas foreign minister told the

group of officers tried unsuccessfully to overthrow noriega on 
wednesday thousands of panamanians angry about his rule and the 
governments inability to pay their salaries poured into the

situation in central america that does not cooperate with the 
pacification efforts that have come about the foreign minister

loma linda medical center said 
wednesday it has agreed to care for a second baby born with only a 
brain stem in hopes that her organs can be used for transplant 
the newly arrived infant a girl identified only as baby 
cassandra was born tuesday at a small hospital in texas with a 
fatal condition known as anencephaly in which most of the brain 
and skull are missing 
at her parents request the infant was incubated and placed 
on a respirator ms mcclintock said in a statement 
dr joyce peabody chief of neonatology at the medical center 
said baby cassandra already is very close to meeting the clinical 
criteria for brain death once that occurs her organs will become 
available for transplant 
an anencephalic infant already at the hospital baby d has not 
shown the required signs of brain death after six days on a 
respirator lessening the chance that major organs can be taken 
from him spokeswoman joyce mcclintock said 
loma linda has developed the nations first medical guidelines 
for preserving anencephalics hearts and other vital organs for 
transplant to critically ill infants 
under the guidelines infants are placed on lifesupport systems 
for seven days if doctors declare an infant braindead within that 
time organ procurement agencies are alerted and a search for a 
suitable recipient begins 
if the infant is not declared brain dead within seven days it 
is taken off the respirator and allowed to die naturally such a 
death causes the organs to deteriorate rendering the heart and 
liver unsuitable for transplant 
however heart valves and corneas are usable and have been taken 
from other babies who died after being removed from respirators 
the hospitals format was devised to address ethical questions 
surrounding the use of doomed anencephalics used as organ donors

president reagan said wednesday he will not 
revise or abandon an american plan for mideast peace talks even 
though israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir complained that it was 
not conducive to peace 
ending two hours of talks with shamir in apparent deadlock 
reagan warned that opponents of the us proposal face certain 
consequences 
theyll need to answer to themselves and their people as to 
why theyve turned down a realistic and sensible plan to achieve 
negotiations the president said standing alongside an unsmiling 
shamir during a white house departure ceremony 
reagan said shamir did not specifically say no to an 
international peace conference demanded by jordans king hussein 
with us support 
however shamir made clear that he rejected the idea i have 
strong reservations concerning the proposed international 
conference which in my view is not conducive to peace he told 
reporters 
shamir last october accepted a proposal by secretary of state 
george p shultz to hold direct talks with jordan under us and 
soviet auspices i shall be ready to consider a similar 
proposal he told reagan 
however hussein has rejected the idea holding out for a 
fullscale international conference and a senior us official 
said standing by itself there would not be much point in 
presenting that again 
the official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity said 
reagan and shamir dealt almost exclusively with differences over 
the international conference 
he said they did not review israels concerns about the us 
proposal that it cede at least part of the west bank and gaza strip 
it has held since the 1967 sixday war in exchange for recognition 
by arab nations 
shamir met for 20 minutes with a group of black congressmen who 
raised their concerns about israels handling of the violence in 
the west bank and gaza strip and israels ties with south africa 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif who heads the congressional black 
caucus said he was dissatisfied with the short time alloted to 
the meeting saying it precluded serious discussion 
shamir will wrap up four days of talks thursday with another 
meeting with shultz we are where we expected to be the us 
official said since shamir did not come to washington with a 
decision by the israeli cabinet on the us plan 
shultz had hoped to convene the peace conference next month and 
to open negotiations may 1 he asked for a prompt reply from israel 
and the arabs we are not setting our watches on any of them 
the senior official said 
but he stressed the need to make arrangements rapidly 
at the departure ceremony in the east room reagan promised to 
work to strengthen usisraeli ties during his final months in 
office 
without specifically mentioning the three months of palestinian 
rioting and the israeli crackdown in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip he said the talks focused on the search for peace in 
the middle east 
weve seen a new sense of urgency on the part of many in the 
region and a wide recognition of the reality that the status quo 
is unacceptable the president said 
he said the present situation is a challenge and an 
opportunity to move decisively to break the deadlock that has 
lasted far too long i hope we will not lose this opportunity 
reagan said the us plan offers a realistic and achievable 
way to change the relationship between israel and the arabs so 
lets be clear about several things the united states will not 
slice this initiative apart and will not abandon it 
explaining reagans stand later the senior us official said 
you start pulling it apart its not going to be workable 
while rejecting the ntion of an international conference shamir 
said israel firmly believes that those who are prepared to live 
with each other in peace must learn to negotiate directly with each 
other 
the us official tried to put a positive face on the talks he 
said there was essentially no slamming of the door by israel 
and that the tone of the talks was excellent 
despite the apparent impasse the president sought to reassure 
the hesitant israeli leader that the united states would not allow 
terms to be dictated at a peace conference and shared shamirs 
distrust of the palestine liberation organization 
the official paraphrased reagan as saying that peace cannot be 
made under violence and terrorism 
he said the plo is revealing its real intent no to peace and 
yes to violence we must find ways to give moderate palestinians 
and other arabs a stake in the process 
vice president george bush hosting a dinner for shamir 
wednesday night at the state department assured him no wedge 
will be driven between the united states and israel 
toasting shamir the vice president said we are like 
brothers our two countries friends and allies forever 
shamir in reply said israel was proud of its record as the 
most consistent supporter of the united states in the united 
nations and of sharing military technology with washington he said 
the usisraeli relationship is stronger than ever

denounce approaching legislative elections and demand more money 
for the national university of el salvador 
the march ended at the treasury ministry where young men 
wielding nailencrusted clubs their faces covered by bandannas or 
ski masks began jeering at troopers 
the troopers fired tear gas but the demonstrators set fire to a 
halfdozen vehicles before they dispersed 
student groups at the university called the march to demand an 
increase in the schools budget it was joined by labor unions and 
other organizations that sympathize with leftist guerrillas 
battling the usbacked government 
the demonstration became more of a condemnation of sundays 
legislative and municipal elections than a demand for increased 
spending on education 
marchers carried posters ridiculing candidates of the governing 
christian democrats and of the main opposition party arena a 
rightist group 
voters will choose mayors and councils in 262 municipalities and 
fill 60 seats in the legislative assembly 
leftist parties are boycotting the vote the guerrillas and 
leftist union members say the elections are a farce that no 
free and fair balloting can be held in the middle of a civil war 
guerrillas from five leftist groups have been fighting since 
1980 to overthrow the government the war has killed about 65000 
people displaced 500000 and ravaged the economy

dying patients in florida nursing homes 
will not be forced to accept tubefeedings after july 1 under a 
rule change instituted by the state wednesday 
it gives those choices back to those persons who are dying 
and not the state saying were going to force you to accept a 
tubefeeding said connie cheren director of the department of 
health and rehabilitative services licensing office 
currently the department permits lifesupport sytems to be 
turned off but does not allow feeding tubes to be withdrawn 
that rule has basically been intrepreted that if the facililty 
does not do the forced feeding it must discharge the resident 
said ms cheren 
the new rule does not relieve a facilitys responsibility to 
do all the palliative things like giving ice chips holding hands 
and rubbing the back easing somebody through the dying stages 
said ms cheren 
its better because sometimes forced feeding is more harmful 
to the person than helpful she said sometimes taking the food 
during the dying stages is more painful for the person because the 
body is shutting down at this time

church leaders in this country and abroad 
wednesday urged clemency for the sharpville six scheduled for 
execution friday in south africa 
church officials also expressed appreciation to president reagan 
for asking south africa to halt the execution on compassionate 
and humanitarian grounds 
the six blacks a woman and five men all in their 20s or 30s 
were convicted in the 1984 death of jacob dlamani black council 
member of sharpville township in a demonstration of about 2000 
people 
the human rights office of the us national council of 
churches which includes most major protestant and eastern orthodox 
bodies urged that the six be spared 
their trial did not fulfill the norms of jurisprudence and 
their executions will not serve the cause of justice in south 
africa the council said in gods name grant clemency to the 
sharpville six 
in a telegram to the south african government the executive 
council of the 17million member united church of christ said 
since the judge in the case has admitted that none of the 
defendants in the case has contributed causally to the alleged 
crime there is no basis for the proposed brutal punishment 
we can only conclude that the planned executions are meant to 
serve a political purpose in continuing efforts of your government 
to deprive black south africans of their political and human 
rights 
from geneva switzerland the rev emilio castro general 
secretary of the world council of churches sent messages to 
ecumenical councils in a score of countries urging them to ask 
their governments to intervene with south africa 
castro said the impending execution for an alleged role in 
murder which has not been proved in the case of any of the six 
accused according to the appeals court judge is disturbing to 
human conscience the world over 
castro also urged continuing prayers of intercession for 
victims and families of the apartheid system may god restore 
justice and peace to south africans

a newly divorced carol leifer sits in her 
apartment amid moving boxes sifting through the remains of her 
marriage 
its one thing to be divorced she muses but what about people 
who have their marriages annulled that means the marriage never 
existed talk about denial 
she shows her wedding pictures what do you tell people when 
they see this oh that was just some play i was in 
leifer a standup comedian bestknown for her frequent 
appearances on late night with david letterman gets to act out 
and expand on elements of her standup act in her first cinemax 
comedy experiment carol doesnt leifer anymore an ode to the 
trauma of divorce cowritten by leifer and late night writer 
fred graver 
the halfhour show airing tonight as well as on march 20 23 
28 and april 5 follows leifer as she packs up to begin anew 
i would say the motivation was definitely from real life 
said leifer who is divorced in real life because the gist of 
the show is oh you get divorced and single life is going to be 
great you think youre going to be that girl you quickly find 
out youre really going to be more like miss hathaway from the 
beverly hillbillies 
as the piece opens leifer hits the road with enthusiasm but 
soon every song on the radio is about lost love and loneliness 
thats will lee the guitarist in the late night band singing 
im mr lonely then she stops at a gas station only to find 
her moving men standing behind the van reading her diary 
once ensconced in her new place she goes grocery shopping 
cleaning out the frozen dinner section and stocking up on cans of 
instant whipped cream which she squirts directly into her mouth in 
times of stress like after strangling her aerobics teacher or 
selecting just the right kind of condoms 
when she does date she decides she cant be too careful and 
leads a prospective beau on a detailed recounting of his entire sex 
life complete with charts and pointer 
friends throw her a surprise party and she meets a possible mr 
right but he turns out to have a herd of kiddies and thinks 
gourmet dining is to be found at the international house of 
pancakes he orders the veal prompting her to think if he goes 
for the syrup im gone 
in real life leifer assures i didnt really have that 
nightmare of a date i never really had a date who took me to get 
his car inspected i mean its never gotten that bad almost 
leifer aspires to have a comedy series of her own perhaps 
something along the lines of its garry shandlings show for 
now she still works the standup circuit recently going as far 
afield as the university of alaska the woman who picked me up 
at the airport said i dont know why we cant get entertainers 
here i thought oh i dont know maybe its the 10hour plane 
ride 
the former saturday night live writer grew up on long 
island and it is middleclass suburbia more than feminism that 
informs her comedy 
i dont really think of myself as a woman doing comedy 
leifer said thats not foremost on my mind there a lot of jokes 
in my act that a man could do but there are also a lot of jokes 
about my experience which happens to be as a woman 
i know when i go to watch comedy ive never liked the kind of 
women comedians who go out and they kind of foster that separation 
in the audience they go out and its a lot of am i right 
ladies am i right its like please someone shoot me if i 
ever say that i just cringe 
there are also a lot more women doing comedy she said 
but i think its just a reflection of the times i mean there 
are also a lot more women in prison too

above a pawn shop in downtown toronto patti 
labelle rips into a group of lackadaisical brooklyn high school 
students 
in her first major dramatic role the pop star is playing an 
inspirational teacher in a movie musical based on sing the annual 
songanddance competition in brooklyns schools 
the legendary program at such schools as erasmus hall gave rise 
to such talents as barbra streisand and neil diamond but with the 
urban decay of the past decade only a dozen schools now take part 
the struggle to preserve that old brooklyn spirit has inspired 
the film sing with a plot centered on education board plans 
to close a beloved high school where generations of immigrants got 
their start 
with songs from the writer of footloose and fame and a 
tempestuous love story between a streetsmart italian kid and a 
jewish princess the tristar pictures production now shooting in 
toronto is scheduled for release in february 1989 
im hooked on it im one of those people who think about 
community and pulling together and family said labelle the 
rhythm and blues artist who first hit the pop charts in the 1960s 
with the blue bells and later in the 70s with the trio labelle 
she has appeared in two previous films a soldiers story and 
the tv movie unnatural causes 
in sing she plays mrs devere an adviser who shakes her 
junior class students out of apathy 
shes very uplifting to the kids labelle said between takes 
of her charttargeted big number total concentration in which 
she demonstrates how to put over a song 
producer craig zadan and screenwriterlyricist dean pitchford 
who won an academy award for fame said they created the part 
with labelle in mind and waited until she found time to do it 
theres a real honesty there nothing phony about her in her 
own way shes lived through what this teacher has gone through 
said pitchford 
labelle has charmed the crew by introducing them to her own home 
cooking fried chicken and potato salad but shes not sure about 
life as an actress 
im not a cher i dont know if id have enough patience to do 
another movie she said complaining about the number of retakes 
it hurts enough some times that you want to cry i like to 
perform live 
however director richard baskin who coproduced streisands 
landmark broadway album and is making his first feature film 
said labelle looked great in the first rushes 
costars include lorraine bracco who played tom berengers wife 
in someone to watch over me louise lasser of mary hartman 
mary hartman fame and george dicenzo who was rob lowes boss in 
about last night the young lovers are peter dobson and jessica 
steen 
for coproducer neil meron a brooklyn and sing alumnus the 
project is a labor of love 
in the high school i went to sing no longer exists meron 
lamented brooklyn is one of the oldest communities in america 
and the way those communities found to express themselves was 
through music and dance 
to research the film the production team talked with veteran 
teachers in brooklyn and attended a sing performance at midwood 
high school where faculty member bella tillis launched the program 
in 1947 
sing competitions involved reviews or skits created and staged 
by a committee from each class the musical skits were judged on 
sing night when freshmen sophomores juniors and seniors got to 
strut their stuff in the 1950s and 60s when sing was at its 
peak the competitions were fierce 
lyricist pitchford also found inspiration in england where hes 
been working with the royal shakespeare co on the broadwaybound 
musical carrie 
after fame the last thing i wanted to do was another high 
school film set in new york about kids who sing and dance he 
said 
but england has tradition and history we can only approximate 
in america the closest thing to that kind of longevity is in east 
coast settlements like brooklyn sing became a metaphor for that 
tradition 
i developed an enormous affection for sing and the 
neighborhoods of brooklyn and a real despair for the passing of 
this tradition

paul dooley wanted to act in silent movies 
he missed that by a few years but hes done ok in the talkies 
and is a member of director robert altmans repertory company hes 
also done fine right in television most recently starring as super 
private eye william j burns in the nbc miniseries the murder of 
mary phagan 
now he is starring in a new series on cbs coming of age he 
plays an airline pilot who is forced kicking and screaming into 
retirement in arizona 
the halfhour comedy also stars phyllis newman as his wife and 
alan young and glynis johns as an incredibly happy couple in the 
retirement village 
its funny here i am playing a guy whos winding down in 
real life ive got a rejuvenation a new family and a new job 
said dooley 
the whole reason i wanted to do movies was to do silent 
pictures he said of course the silents were long gone but 
when i did the ed sullivan show my dressing room was across from 
buster keatons a few months later we did a commercial together 
we played keystone kops he was so sweet he never seemed to gain 
any sophistication 
the thing i loved about laurel and hardy was that they were so 
sweet to each other one reason i didnt want to do a series was 
that in so many i saw people insulted each other in this my 
character is retired which is why hes unhappy he complains about 
the heat of arizona and the boredom of retirement i find the 
character enjoyable he has his frustrations but he doesnt insult 
people most of my conflict is with alan young why is he so 
happy 
dooley 60 has three collegeage children from his first 
marriage he remarried and has a 2yearold daughter savannah 
dooley says he often plays younger because his hair hasnt 
thinned or turned gray it gives me a longer career he said 
he grew up in west virginia with the hope of becoming a 
cartoonist i drew a lot he said and i kept that ambition 
until about halfway through college i was at the university of 
west virginia at morgantown i was doing plays and finally switched 
my major to drama i had 50 when i graduated and drove an old 
dodge to new york i had to keep it in a friends driveway in 
brooklyn because i couldnt afford to run it 
don knotts and i had been in college together and he got me my 
first job in new york he mentioned my name and i got a job on a 
childrens tv show bobby benson and the barb ranch i played 
dons nephew for about six months 
dooley who had been a teenage juggler and magician next 
landed the role of coocoo the clown on a saturday morning show 
id pull a string and a bird came out of my hat he said i 
brought my whole bag of tricks with me and id perform at birthday 
parties it paid the rent 
he became a member of second citys new york improvisational 
group and at about the same time began to do television guest star 
work and small parts in movies he was in an offbroadway play 
written by jules feiffer when director robert altman saw him 
he was looking for the father of the bride in a wedding 
he said dennis christopher played his son in that movie and later 
in a nonaltman film breaking away 
dooley didnt do the tv series breaking away because by that 
time he was off to malta to play wimpy in altmans popeye he 
wore a fat suit a fake moustache and had to cut off most of his 
hair 
for the last 10 years hes done mostly movies such as sixteen 
candles health kiss me goodbye a perfect couple 
endangered species and big trouble he was also a regular 
on the dom deluise show

comedian paul rodriguez says he has never 
been happy with television either as a performer or a viewer but 
is willing to give it another shot 
rodriguez and eddie velez costar in the new cbs comedy trial 
and error as two young hispanic men who share an apartment but 
little else in life they are as mismatched as oscar and felix in 
the odd couple or balki and larry in perfect strangers 
the only unique thing about this is that im in it said 
rodriguez a standup comic its contrived but its an attempt 
to get more latinos into television who cares its a job maybe 
it will open some doors to other latino actors im happy with 
everybody for going out ot the way to make the show more accessible 
to latinos im dubbing it in spanish for simulcast over radio 
stations in 10 cities 
rodriguez plays tony rivera a funky entrepreneur who makes his 
living selling tshirts to tourists velez is john hernandez a 
cleancut ambitious young attorney 
john is typical of a lot of latinos whose ambition is to cross 
over and assimilate rodriguez said he thinks if you get a 
college education work 9to5 people are going to forget your 
background and ask you to join the california club 
my characters philosophy is that if you have enough money you 
can do anything you want his whole thing is to get enough money to 
tell the world where to get off of course neither of us are 
right 
he describes john as the kind of young man all latinos want 
their sons to grow up to be and my character is the kind most of 
them actually grow up to be he said 
his first series was the shortlived aka pablo on abc in 
1984 
i was not anxious to get back into television he said my 
experience with aka pablo was not happy i was at the comedy 
store when norman lear came into my life the show was overhyped 
when it failed i was blamed by latinos for its image 
this time i said i wanted to be more involved i wanted to do 
some writing i suggested we call the show east la law 
trial and error originated as an idea by tommy chong of the 
comedy team cheech and chong and howard brown about an 
upandcoming young latino attorney who still lived at home it was 
called the family martinez 
cbs liked the idea of the lawyer but wanted the show recast and 
changed to a buddy show it then became amigos 
when they called me i said i wouldnt be in a show called 
amigos said rodriguez i felt i had already overstereotyped 
myself 
rodriguez was born in mexico and was raised in various parts of 
this country as the son of migrant farm workers 
as a kid i had a lovehate relationship with television he 
said television showed me the things i would never have cars i 
would never drive places i would never see my favorite show was 
route 66 two single men driving a corvette down the highway 
wind blowing in their hair and always a blonde around the bend 
then id look around my neighborhood i didnt see any corvettes or 
blondes 
that worries me because now that im in tv ill be a part of 
the problem as some latino boy sees me with nice clothes and the 
right people 
besides tv and his concert appearances rodriguez has been in 
five movies dc cab quicksilver born in east la 
miracles and whoopee boys 
my favorite is quicksilver because it gave me a chance to 
do some dramatic acting he said 
rodriguez said he is constantly asked if the show will advance 
the cause of latinos 
come on he said this is just another sitcom and im not 
that altruistic were happy to be working if a byproduct is that 
we help other latinos im all for it but thats not my goal my 
goal is to become financially secure so that my kids dont have to 
harvest someone elses vegetables not that thats not an honorable 
job but let somebody else do it im not the latino moses im 
just a standup comic my job is to make people laugh

exiled television evangelist jim bakker is 
dreaming of attracting a new flock to a christian retreat in the 
california desert even as ptl the ministry he left behind one 
year ago saturday struggles to survive 
ptl under the control of a us bankruptcy court in columbia 
continues to spend thousands of dollars a day more than it takes in 
the ministrys television network is in the middle of a march 
to victory telethon with a goal of raising 42 million by april 
1 to meet expenses and ptl is considering the sale of hundreds of 
undeveloped acres at the heritage usa theme park to pay creditors 
the woman bakker admitted having sex with and paying money to 
keep silent jessica hahn is living in the playboy mansion in los 
angeles she is writing more of her story for playboy magazine 
spokesman bill farley said 
the man bakker originally accused of using blackmail to cause 
his march 19 downfall at ptl the rev jimmy swaggart is dealing 
with his own admitted sexual transgression that knocked him from 
the pulpit 
and the evangelist bakker accused of stealing ptl the rev 
jerry falwell is back preaching at his old time gospel hour in 
virginia 
falwell who led ptl for six months said its been a dismal 
year it was obviously the toughest year evangelicals have ever 
faced he said credibility was gravely injured by the ptl 
scandal 
the national religious broadcasters association met in 
washington last month to set stricter standards of moral and 
financial accountability 
it is going to take me years to say all that i have learned 
through this bakker told the charlotte observer recently and 
im going to be a different minister im going to be less 
judgmental 
bakker calls his proposed new promised land heritage springs and 
says it would be a 1600acre complex that would be similar to 
heritage usa outside fort mill sc he says it would be located in 
the california desert but no specific plans have been made 
the boyishlooking minister newly ordained by a littleknown 
oklahoma church was used to preaching in a hightech studio his 
sermons carried via satellite 
the scene was very different last week when bakker delivered his 
first homily since heading west 
for 30 minutes he preached to elderly retirees at a trailer 
park beside the salton sea in a desolate stretch of desert south of 
palm springs where he and his wife tammy live 
tammy who wept after introducing her husband to the 
congregation in a tiny wooden chapel that doubles as a bingo hall 
said it has been a hard year for them 
some people will ask what have you learned in this last year 
that you could share the thing that i have learned the most is 
that when everything is gone and what you worked 25 years to build 
has crumbled to your feet god doesnt change mrs bakker said 
and what of the evangelical empire bakker began building in 1978 
the devout still travel to fort mill to vacation at the 500acre 
heritage usa with its hotel water park and stables the cable 
television network still uses bakkers upbeat formula of 
entertainment mixed with preaching prayer lines and pledges 
but there are new faces and a new message integrity and modesty 
david clark a former christian broadcasting network executive 
who was appointed ptl trustee by bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
continually assures viewers the new guard isnt out for greed and 
glory 
the people here are living modestly and conservatively he 
said on the show recently there are no sevenfigure salaries 
here and there are no celebrities were willing to be accountable 
to you 
an internal revenue service report filed in bankruptcy court 
said the bakkers and their top aides received 146 million in 
excessive compensation from 1984 to 1987 
a federal grand jury in charlotte nc is investigating bakker 
for possible tax wire and mail fraud 
last week bakker fired his own salvo he had a lawsuit filed in 
york county against roy grutman a new york attorney who used to 
represent the ministry bakker is charging that grutman tricked him 
into resigning and turning the ministry over to falwell 
the bakkers who are seeking more than 10000 in damages claim 
they did not know grutman also represented falwell at the time he 
advised the bakkers to step down 
the suit says grutman told the bakkers that swaggart was heading 
a conspiracy to take over ptl

in the year since jim bakker disclosed 
his sexual encounter with jessica hahn many former friends have 
turned against her shes angry and hurt and shes planning to 
retaliate in print 
im not exactly the most loved person there are a lot of 
angry people my mother never gave me a middle name and i finally 
figured out why because its controversy said the 28yearold 
former church secretary 
much has happened to her in the year since her tryst with bakker 
became public forcing him to resign the ptl ministry 
she was paid 1 million by playboy to tell her story she 
claimed bakker had forcibly taken away her virginity though he 
said she appeared to be sexually experienced and was a willing 
participant 
her appearance in the pages of americas leading mens magazine 
was just the start of her relationship with the playboy empire she 
moved into founder hugh hefners los angeles mansion she denied 
she had become his lover 
she recuperated at the mansion after having her breasts lifted 
and her teeth and nose fixed she bought a red mercedes 560 sl 
convertible 
and she was forced to contend with a series of allegations that 
she was not the innocent bible belle that she claimed 
one married man said he had slept with her before 1980 while two 
others said they had had affairs with her she said all three lied 
then a long island woman claimed in a penthouse story that miss 
hahn had worked as a call girl for her finally the son of barbara 
bencivenga pietropaolo a neighbor claimed he had been seduced by 
miss hahn when he was 14 
people have made a career out of my name its unbelievable 
miss hahn said its mean what people are doing its really bad 
the madam story cmon i never left my house im the one girl who 
didnt even go out nightclubbing 
but ms pietropaolo who a year ago helped shield miss hahn from 
reporters brought her messages and drove her on errands is angry 
she makes herself like a madonna but i still say shes like 
the antichrist she said 
miss hahn has forgotten all her friends ms pietropaolo 
said there were times she seemed so sweet and so nice 
ms pietropaolo said her 12yearold daughter tiffany still 
misses miss hahn tiffany was so close to her that she said if 
i ever make it big youll be dripping in furs and diamonds she 
didnt even say goodbye 
jessica hahn is working on her own kind of farewell another 
magazine story she says will explain why so many people who used to 
be her friends have attacked her she spends her days writing at 
the los angeles mansion where she has her own room and can stay 
indefinitely 
she occasionally goes shopping jogs and takes trips to new 
york where photographers have caught her at publicity parties 
recently she said she bumped into entertainer liza minnelli at a 
los angeles restaurant she was pleased to learn that miss minnelli 
did not believe the attacks on jessica hahn 
still miss hahn said she thinks this other story needs to be 
told 
i have to defend myself she said im going to have the 
last word believe me

shareholders are waiting for koppers co to 
say how much they could get under the company recapitalization plan 
being considered as a defense against an unsolicited 45 per share 
takeover bid from a british investor and the investment firm 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
thats what im waiting for robert kanters of legg mason 
wood walker inc of pittsburgh said wednesday we really dont 
know how much better the deal is until we get the particulars 
koppers on wednesday rejected as inadequate the 13 billion 
tender offer from bns inc a group led by shearson and british 
investor brian beazer and said it was studying a recapitalization 
as an alternative 
the disclosures came as shearson faced increasing state and 
local government pressure over its unusual role in the takeover bid 
koppers stock dipped 87 cents to 5362 a share wednesday in 
heavy new york stock exchange trading 
koppers said its recapitalization which analysts have 
speculated could pay cash and securities worth 55 to 60 a share 
would include a substantial cash dividend to holders of koppers 
nearly 28 million common shares plus stock in the recapitalized 
company 
recapitalization essentially making a major adjustment in a 
companys relative levels of debt and equity has been used often 
in recent years as a takeover defense a recapitalizing company 
generally must make huge borrowings to finance the special dividend 
to shareholders making a takeover much more expensive 
charles r pullin koppers chairman said the company also 
would explore the public sale of all or a part of its construction 
materials business one of its two business lines to help boost 
the special dividend it also would consider the sale of its common 
stock to a new employee stock ownership plan 
a koppers spokesman said the board of directors set no timetable 
for settling details of any recapitalization plan 
beazer quickly criticized koppers announcement and claimed 
that if koppers explored a recapitalization the company was 
obligated to give confidential corporate information to bns 
beazer said that based on recent court decisions in similar 
recapitalizations kopper essentially would be bidding for itself 
koppers therefore was obligated to give bns access to the same 
confidential corporate data koppers or any other bidder would 
get for formulating the plan 
shearson which holds a 46 percent share in bns came under 
further fire from city and state lawmakers 
shearsons equity participation is an aggressive variation of 
investment bankers traditional role as adviser and financier in 
hostile takeovers 
the city of pittsburgh filed a federal suit claiming that 
shearson an underwriter of city bonds by joining with beazer 
had violated its duty not to hurt the pittsburgh economy 
under beazers plan to sell koppers chemical business about 
1100 jobs could disappear in pittsburgh city officials contend 
separately mayor richard caliguiri ordered department heads to 
exclude shearson from consideration as an underwriter of future 
financing said spokesman david welty 
in addition pennsylvania treasurer g davis greene jr 
suspended his departments dealings with shearson the state 
purchased 565 million in commercial notes and bonds from the firm 
in the past six months according to greene 
separately pennsylvanias state employees retirement system 
approved a resolution expressing concern over the takeover attempt 
the system holds 544650 shares of american express shearsons 
parent and 17900 shares of koppers 
some analysts speculated koppers soon would join the negative 
publicity campaign against shearson 
i would expect the first thing youll seewill be some 
newspaper advertising thatll peel the hide off shearson said 
donald a pattison of cyrus j lawrence inc of new york 
koppers alleged in a federal lawsuit filed march 11 that 
shearson violated disclosure requirements of securities laws and 
that it offered to sell koppers its services defending the company 
against hostile takeovers after laying plans with beazer to raid

a federal judge pressing for quick 
payments of damage claims stemming from the dalkon shield birth 
control device has approved the merger of ah robins co and 
american home products corp 
us district judge robert r merhige jr signed an order 
wednesday to allow the merger between robins which sold the dalkon 
shield in the early 1970s and new yorkbased american home 
attorneys for robins its shareholders and the 195000 women who 
have filed injury claims stemming from use of the device endorsed 
the merger of the two drug makers which includes creation of a 
2475 billion dalkon shield trust fund to compensate victims 
before approving the deal merhige had to be satisfied that some 
claims would be paid before final approval of robins bankruptcy 
reorganization plan robins has been under chapter 11 protection 
from creditors since august 1985 
the judge approved the jan 19 merger agreement only after 
robins offered to provide 100 million to cover administrative 
startup costs for the trust fund and to begin sending payments to 
some of the victims 
merhige said he was concerned about a provision in the merger 
agreement that allowed american home to pull out of the deal if 
appeals of the final reorganization plan remained pending a year 
after the plan was confirmed by the court 
the judge suggested american home put up 100 million to cover 
the startup costs and said he would not approve the merger 
agreement without it 
later in the day robins offered to provide the 100 million and 
the judge agreed to the merger deal roscoe e puckett jr a 
robins spokesman said the first payments will involve smaller 
amounts for women who claimed lesser use and injuries from the 
dalkon shield 
any payments still are at least several months away court 
approval of the merger is only one step in the reorganization of 
robins a richmondbased pharmaceutical manufacturer 
the companys final reorganization plan also requires approval 
by robins stockholders and creditors including the dalkon shield 
claimants 
the merger with american home involves an exchange of 700 
million of american home common stock and full payment to robins 
trade creditors in addition to the provision of the dalkon shield 
trust fund 
merhige said he would conduct a hearing later to review a filing 
by the rorer group inc which had sought to acquire robins for a 
25 million breakup fee stemming from a previous merger agreement 
between robins and fort washington pabased rorer 
after merhige set the 2475 billion figure for dalkon shield 
claims late last year robins had three corporate suitors robins 
rejected the rorer deal and a similar proposal from frances sanofi 
sa in favor of american home which offered a substantially quicker 
settlement of dalkon shield claims

texaco inc says it will turn over 
information sought by several small shareholders who have objected 
to the companys bankruptcy reorganization plan 
the companys largest shareholder financier carl icahn also 
has objected to provisions of the plan that would release officers 
of texaco getty oil co and various getty trusts from any 
liability in texacos acquisition of getty oil 
a texas jury decided in 1985 that texaco had wrongly interfered 
with pennzoil cos agreement to merge with getty and awarded 
pennzoil 1053 billion in damages 
texaco filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy code a year ago to avoid having to post a 
potentially ruinous bond to appeal the decision 
as part of its plan for emerging from chapter 11 texaco would 
pay pennzoil 3 billion cash to settle their case 
the documents sought by the small shareholders covered 
discussions on why the reorganization plan would release the 
texaco getty and trust officials from liability 
the 16 shareholders had filed suit against those parties to seek 
reimbursement of the settlement costs from them and the 
reorganization plan would cause those suits to be dismissed 
daniel krasner a lawyer for one of the shareholders said the 
attorneys for the shareholders would study the documents and decide 
by monday whether to continue opposing the plan 
texaco shareholders are voting on the reorganization proposal 
and a bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled for next week to hear 
the results of the vote as well as arguments on whether the judge 
should confirm the plan 
in papers filed with bankruptcy judge howard schwartzberg 
icahn who controls about 148 percent of texacos shares said he 
would vote for the reorganization proposal but urged the judge to 
drop the liability release 
the releases are a purely gratuitous act and an unconscionable 
act of selfdealing by texacos directors he said

bankruptcies bank failures and a criminal 
investigation of texas savings and loan industry continue to bash 
the states financial image as the nations biggest and the best 
and analysts say the worst isnt over 
banking analyst herb jones of the investment firm eppler guerin 
amp turner says texans used to brag that everything in the state was 
bigger better the best 
we cant say that now we look at the northeast and see their 
growth is far superior to ours that was never supposed to 
happen jones said wednesday 
as the states largest bankholding company seeks federal 
rescue the nations perception of texas has become more negative 
analysts say 
dallasbased first republicbank corp with 332 billion in 
deposits and 134 banking facilities statewide acknowledged tuesday 
it was seeking federal help because of a deteriorating loan 
portfolio and difficulty in raising deposits 
gerald w fronterhouse chairman and chief executive officer 
said a loss of 1 billion in deposits since the beginning of 
february contributed to the banks decision 
there are signs the states battered economy is rebounding and 
that the energy industry is revitalizing but analysts say the 
banking industry still lags coping with mistakes made one to three 
years ago and the continuing troubles in real estate 
real estate is still a real thorn here jones said i 
expect some further weakness in the real estate sector 
also hurting the states image are the bankruptcy court 
petitions of such texas notables as former gov john connally who 
was us treasury secretary under president nixon connallys 
lieutenant governor ben barnes oil heir cullen davis of fort 
worth famed heart surgeon denton cooley some businesses of the 
billionaire hunt brothers former dallas cowboys owner clint 
murchison and the western co of north america owned by texas 
rangers owner eddie chiles 
the number of texas bank failures meanwhile continues soaring 
nearly doubling from 26 in 1986 to 50 in 1987 and stands at 15 so 
far this year 
we do have some other banks that are in trouble i have no 
reason to think weve hit the bottom of the problem there could 
still be some more banks to be heard from jones said 
staggering losses continue at other banks with the states 
seven largest bankholding companies losing a combined 26 billion 
last year by contrast all texas banks lost 8832 million in 1986 
regulators also say more than onethird of the states 281 
savings and loan institutions are insolvent the fbi and the us 
justice department are in the midst of a criminal investigation of 
some of the states thrifts called the largest whitecollar probe 
in the southwests history 
tuesday houstonbased first city bancorporation of texas inc 
extended its deadline for debt holders to redeem their securities 
at a discount under a rescue plan representing the secondlargest 
bank bailout in us history 
jones said he believes a major financial institution will come 
into texas and take over first republicbank if the federal deposit 
insurance corp makes it an attractive deal 
its a very desirable institution at a price jones said 
a lot of worms are in there still will the fdic pick them up 
thats the question i think they will theyre going to have to 
first republicbanks plea for federal aid is a bittersweet 
story said alan coleman director of the southwestern graduate 
school of banking at southern methodist university 
the good news is that new capital will be brought into the 
state along with new faces and new investors but the bad news he 
said is that its very tough on the people struggling with the 
problems here

firestone tire amp rubber co has gained a court 
victory in its attempt to thwart a takeover by italian tiremaker 
pirelli with a federal judges refusal to block ohios 
antitakeover law as unconstitutional 
us district judge alice m batchelder ruled wednesday that the 
ohio control share acquisition act does not violate federal law by 
discriminating against interstate commerce or causing inconsistent 
state regulation 
pirelli societe generale sa had sought a preliminary injunction 
against the law in attempting to press an unsolicited 58 a share 
or 19 billion takeover bid for firestone which has its north 
american tire headquarters in akron 
firestone stock closed at 6312 a share wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange unchanged from tuesdays close 
the ohio statute requires a hostile bidder to wait up to 50 days 
for shareholders to vote before it may purchase tendered shares 
federal law requires that any tender offer remain open for no less 
than 20 business days 
judge batchelder said it was possible for companies to comply 
with both ohio and federal law 
the ohio act by allowing the shareholders collectively to 
evaluate the fairness of the tender offer and to vote as a group 
furthers the policy of investor protection ms batchelder 
wrote in a 14page opinion 
the ohio statute does not discriminate against interstate 
commerce or cause inconsistent state regulation because it has the 
same effects on bidders from inside and outside of ohio she stated 
pirellis 19 billion offer is contingent on firestone dropping 
its plans to sell 75 percent of its tire business to bridgestone 
corp of japan 
firestone officials said pirellis offer effectively killed 
earlier plans to sell most of the firestone tiremaking business to 
bridgestone but it again was talking with bridgestone about other 
options 
the us tire maker said it would advise shareholders by friday 
on the pirelli offer

henley group inc a twoyearold 
holding company says it plans to split into two public companies 
and buy back 22 percent of its stock 
the stock buyback announced wednesday would cost about 512 
million at current prices 
henley jumped 175 a share to close at 25625 a share in 
overthecounter trading 
henley is an amalgam of 35 construction environmental energy 
chemcial manufacturing and finance businesses spun off in april 
1986 by alliedsignal inc which itself was formed by a 5 billion 
merger in 1985 
henley has gained a reputation for tightening operations to 
boost profits in individual units and then taking those units 
public the current market value of henleys investments in its 
subsidiaries that have publicly traded shares and its other 
longterm investment securities is 2 billion 
in recent months henley has been involved in a sofar 
unsuccessful bid for santa fe southern pacific corp the 
chicagobased railroad land and natural resources giant 
under the restructuring which was approved in principle by the 
companys board on wednesday henleys assets would be divided 
between two public companies 
wheelabrator group inc which already is publicly traded 
would take over henleys stake in its successful wheelabrator 
technologies inc subsidiary and other assets related to the 
refusetoenergy business 
wheelabrator group would have the flexibility and resources to 
speed up the expansion of its businesses through mergers 
acquisitions and joint ventures 
a newly created entity to be called henley group inc would 
own signal capital corp signal landmark holdings inc henley 
manufacturing corp and henleys stake in fisher scientific group 
inc plus other assets 
this program will enable our shareholders to participate 
directly in henleys 650 million investment in wheelabrator 
technologies the nations leading refusetoenergy business 
said michael dingman henleys chairman and chief executive 
shares of the new entity that will be created for henleys other 
holdings will be distributed to stockholders as a partially taxable 
special dividend the company said 
henleys board also authorized the repurchase of 20 million of 
the companys 90 million outstanding shares the number of 
outstanding shares peaked at 129 million in november 1986 before 
the company initiated a series of stock buybacks 
after the buyback is completed henley will have repurchased 
nearly 43 percent of its stock 
separately henley said it decided to waive protection under a 
recently enacted delaware statute providing that a holder of 15 
percent of a companys stock is prohibited from merging with the 
company or undertaking certain other actions for three years 
we do not believe it is in the best interests of shareholders 
to impose these restrictions dingman said we prefer to give 
investors a free hand to make those decisions 
henleys top management owns about 65 million of the companys 
shares that stake would rise to 93 percent with the completion of 
the stock repurchase 
henley spokesman norman ritter said management wasnt 
considering a bid to take the company private 
henley also said it intends to raise 1 billion by issuing 
notes then using the proceeds to pay off its current 980 million 
in bank debt that will allow the company to arrange 25 billion 
in new bank credit henley said

share prices were lower at midday thursday but 
well above their worst levels helped by a cut in bank base lending 
rates 
trading was subdued however amid nervousness ahead of the 
release of us trade data for january 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was down 62 
points or 03 percent at 18195 at midday 
volume was a light 2774 million shares at midday compared with 
3141 million shares at the same time wednesday 
britains major commercial banks cut their base lending rate by 
half a percentage point to 85 percent after the bank of england 
signaled that it wanted such a cut by cutting its own money market 
intervention rates 
the cuts took the market by surprise and triggered a wave of 
buying lifting share prices from their lowest levels dealers said 
the rate cut came as the pound moved above 310 west german 
marks and seemed to confirm a new unofficial government cap for the 
pound at that level which was seen as a positive development 
dealers said 
but some dealers said the rate cut also raised worries about 
overheating in the economy 
the market is very vulnerable to bad news at the moment a 
dealer said

the federal deposit insurance corp is planning to 
pump about 1 billion of capital into first republicbank corp to 
offset a twoday drain of deposits according to a report published 
today 
the dallas morning news quoted unidentified banking sources as 
saying the run on funds would force the fdic to transfer about 1 
billion in interim assistance perhaps as early as today 
sources also said such interim assistance is likely to include a 
blanket guarantee of all deposits by the fdic 
without a blanket guarantee from the fdic the deposits are 
going to leave a banking analyst who asked to remain 
unidentified told the newspaper you have to stabilize the 
patient before you can do the surgery 
officials of the bank and the fdic declined comment late 
wednesday on the report 
meanwhile texas sen lloyd bentsen estimated it could cost up 
to 5 billion to prop up first republicbank but he says federal 
regulators were prepared to help the bank holding company avoid a 
financial collapse 
bentsen said wednesday he spoke with federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan robert l clarke the comptroller of the currency 
and l william seidman chairman of the fdic 
ive been assured that all of those financial institutions are 
standing by to help bentsen said theyre going to do all they 
can to see that this situation is stabilized 
bentsen said the senate banking committee gave him the 5 
billion figure but he also said he did not believe there were any 
definitive figures yet on the cost of a rescue plan 
first republicbank the states biggest banking company 
acknowledged tuesday it had been forced to seek federal aid because 
of a deteriorating loan portfolio and difficulty in raising 
deposits 
a first republicbank spokesman said wednesday the bank 
experienced a runoff of deposits on tuesday but that the situation 
apparently had stabilized an earlier drain of deposits and 
customer defections had forced it to begin preliminary discussions 
with the fdic the spokesman said 
tuesday there was a significant amount of activity and there 
were some deposit outflows the spokesman said but there were 
no lines or confusion in our branches or banks 
the spokesman did not quantify the size of the deposit outflows 
the fdic is prepared to assist with capital and the federal 
reserve with liquidity bentsen said 
each of these regulatory powers have assured me they will do 
everything they can that is necessary to keep that situation from 
unraveling he said 
bentsen said the agencies would ensure first republicbank 
branches statewide remained open but would not comment on the 
status of the holding company

the nations trade deficit widened slightly in january to 124 
billion after two months of sharp improvements the commerce 
department said today in a report that left financial markets 
uncertain 
the dollar and the bond market rallied after the report but 
gave back most of their gains after a few minutes 
the excess of imports over exports was up from the 122 billion 
deficit in december 
exports which had propelled improvement in november and 
december fell by 10 percent in january to 223 billion 
analysts had expected a deterioration of the trade balance in 
january noting that exports are traditionally down in that month 
however imports also fell in january by 6 percent to 348 
billion 
thus the deficit for the month eagerly followed by financial 
markets was somewhat better than most analysts had expected 
within half an hour of the reports 830 am est release the 
treasurys benchmark 30year bond was yielding 858 percent little 
changed from 860 percent late wednesday and the dollar was barely 
higher against the japanese yen british pound and west german mark 
on wednesday the federal reserve said industrial production 
edged up 02 percent in february despite output reductions at auto 
factories and coal mines 
economists said the gain although slower than the january rise 
represented good news for the economy and further dampened concerns 
about a severe slowdown in the aftermath of the october stock 
market crash 
a more positive signal came from the commerce department which 
said the housing industry after staggering for two months enjoyed 
an 89 percent gain in construction activity in february the 
biggest rise in more than a year 
with interest rates at low levels and the economy growing and 
no recession in sight we think we have all the ingredients in 
place to generate a strong spring building season said warren 
lasko executive vice president of the mortgage bankers association 
nevertheless the news hurt the bond market a barometer of 
interest rates and the economy stronger growth implies future 
inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome investments 
the treasurys key 30year issue fell 10 per 1000 in face 
amount its yield jumped from 851 percent to 860 percent its 
highest level since late january 
but the stock market closed largely higher the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks which most of the day showed a 
modest loss ended with a 1691 point gain at 206432 in slow 
trading

grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed 
this morning on the chicago board of trade then began trending a 
little higher 
traders said the support for soybeans came from aggressive 
commodity fund buying 
and those improving prices gave a lift to corn futures which 
had been under light pressure from commercial and speculative 
selling according to dale gustafson an analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
trading was very light in the wheat pit but that grain received 
some help from the belief that it had been oversold 
in early dealings wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 303 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to 1 cent higher with march at 198 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with march at 190 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with march at 613 a

the factory operating rate remained unchanged 
in february for the third consecutive month as cutbacks in auto 
production and coal mining held back gains in other areas the 
government reported today 
the federal reserve said that americas factories mines and 
utilities operated at 824 percent of capacity the highest 
operating rate in more than eight years 
while the february rate was unchanged the government revised 
upward the operating rates for december and january a month ago 
the government had put the operating rate in those months at 822 
percent 
analysts said the fact that the overall rate has been frozen for 
three months was consistent with their view that production slowed 
in the early part of 1988 businesses were cutting back on orders 
in an effort to reduce a backlog of unsold goods which piled up 
during the final three months of 1988 
the backlog was particularly high in the auto area where auto 
makers have had to resume incentive programs to spur sales 
in february the operating rate at manufaturing plants remained 
unchanged at 825 percent of capacity this reflected an operating 
rate of 801 percent at plants making durable goods unchanged from 
january and a rate of 859 percent at factories making nondurable 
goods down 02 percentage point from the january rate 
auto plants operated at 77 percent of capacity in february down 
from 774 percent in january and a full 5 percentage points below 
the operating rate in october 
the mining industry operated at 806 percent of capacity in 
february down from 811 percent in january the decline was 
attributed to a drop in production at coal mines 
us utilities operated at 822 percent of capacity last month 
up from 817 percent in january 
the overall operating rate of 824 percent was more than two 
percentage points higher than the 797 percent operating rate in 
february 1987 it was the highest level since march 1980 when 
production hit 837 percent of capacity

jbs restaurants inc says it will 
withdraw from the big boy franchise system and operate its 110 
restaurants in 10 western states independently 
jbs chairman clark jones said the decision came after careful 
evaluation of the companys relationship with big boy franchisor 
elias brothers restaurants inc 
during our 27 years in business we have internally developed 
the systems and organization necessary to operate as an independent 
regional restaurant chain he said we believe that we can best 
maximize our shareholders interests by eliminating the territorial 
restrictions and franchise fees required under our current 
franchise agreement 
the salt lake city based jbs operates restaurants in utah 
idaho montana washington wyoming oregon arizona new mexico 
south dakota and hawaii the company said thursday 
jones said the company does not expect to have significant costs 
in connection with the withdrawal 
under the agreement we have an option to withdraw from the 
system without cost and we had already planned to repaint all of 
our buildings and change all of our signs in connection with the 
reimaging of our concept jones said 
however we will take a one time noncash charge during the 
third quarter of approximately 15 million for the writeoff of 
related intangible territorial franchise rights he added 
jones said elimination of franchise fees will allow the company 
to recover the writeoff over a twoyear period 
under the terms of its agreement jbs has six months to change 
its signs and eliminate the references to big boy from its menus 
clark said most of the changes will occur during the second half 
of the sixmonth period because the company has the option to 
reenter the system before june 15 1988

allowing private companies to go into the mail 
delivery business could improve service but such a drastic change 
must be phased in gradually the presidents commission on 
privatization says 
over time the government monopoly on delivering letters should 
be ended with immediate steps to allow private firms to deliver 
advertising and to operate in rural areas the commission 
recommends 
the mail recommendations are part of a detailed report on 
privatizing various government operations scheduled to be released 
friday at the white house 
other aspects of the study include developing a system of 
private air traffic control towers issuing vouchers for lowincome 
housing instead of building public housing units selling the 
governments 250 billion loan portfolio and issuing vouchers for 
public school education 
in general the study reports the benefits of switching to a 
competitive mail delivery system would outweigh the problems 
although the changeover could be confusing and costly 
the overall costs of postal service should be reduced through 
competition the commission concluded and efficiency could be 
improved the report noted that the growth of competition in parcel 
delivery has provided consumer with more alternatives and price 
competition 
officials of the us postal service said thursday they could 
not comment on the report until they have had a chance to study it 
however major unions representing postal workers already have 
fired a volley at the study based on preliminary reports of what it 
would contain 
if mail delivery is opened to competition private companies 
will skim off the moneymaking city delivery routes and leave the 
more expensive rural deliveries to the postal service the national 
association of letter carriers contended the american postal 
workers union also has opposed privatization plans 
such a change would destroy the nations system of universal 
service the letter carriers union charged rural and innercity 
residents would not be served by private firms andor would receive 
reduced service at exorbitant postage rates 
former postmaster general preston r tisch last fall termed the 
idea of privatization a dubious solution contending that the 
changeover would be chaotic and impractical 
the conservative heritage foundation however has lent its 
support to at least limited privatization calling for rule changes 
to allow private firms to deliver thirdclass advertising mail and 
for increased contracting out of postal services 
the recommendations of the privatization commission are more 
sweeping however if tempered with the caution that the changeover 
could be confusing as was the switch from a telephone monopoly to 
a system of competing systems 
changing to a private system could cause problems for many of 
the postal services 800000 workers and tax money could be 
required to assist in finding new jobs and in retraining the study 
indicates 
in addition the change could result in varying postage rates 
according to which company a mailer used perhaps including 
differing rates depending on distance traveled 
questions also arise about liability for lost mail and the 
process of notifying a variety of companies about changes of 
address the study noted 
even so it contends the longrun benefits should outweigh the 
problems associated with a change 
the recommendation comes at a trying time for the postal 
service caught in a public relations bind between congressional 
budget cutting which has forced it to reduce window hours and 
collections at the same time rates are being raised 
here is a rundown of the basic postal service recommendations of 
the commission 
open mail delivery to competition but on a gradual basis with 
compensation for postal workers and managers for loss of benefits 
and earnings 
consider turning the postal service itself into a private 
business perhaps by selling stock in the agency to its employees 
immediately end restrictions on private firms delivering 
thirdclass advertising widely known as junk mail 
immediately open up rural delivery to competition 
end restrictions on private firms placing mail in letter boxes 
at peoples homes 
ease restrictions on delivery of express mail 
actively pursue all possibilities for contracting out services

the canadian dollar buoyed by higher interest 
rates north of the border rose to 80 us cents thursday for the 
first time in four years 
analysts said the possibility that central american instability 
might drive prices higher for oil and other commodities was one 
reason the canadian currencys overnight rise from 799 us cents 
to 8008 cents 
because of canadas dependence on oil grain mineral and lumber 
exports the canadian dollar is viewed on international exchanges 
as a semicommodity based currency 
it had been testing the psychologically important 80cent mark 
for the past two weeks 
the fundamentals support the canadian dollar right now said 
money market specialist june riley of the royal bank of canada 
the fact that we have not had strong intervention by the bank 
of canada suggests that as long as the canadian dollar is moving in 
an orderly fashion it could go higher 
she also attributed some of the overnight strengthening to 
speculators riding the canadian currencys recent upswing 
the higher canadian dollar is bad news for american tourists 
who got 140 for their us dollars two years ago and now get 
120 at hotels and stores but for thousands of canadians making 
their annual latewinter pilgrimage to florida or arizona the new 
exchange rate is a windfall 
the two dollars were last at par in 1976 and the canadian 
currency dipped to an alltime low of 6913 us cents in february 
1986 it was last worth 80 cents on feb 24 1984 
it has risen 15 percent since then with a 4cent surge this 
year after governor john crow of the bank of canada made it clear 
that high interest rates will prevail until inflation is virtually 
eradicated canadas annual inflation rate is now 41 percent 
prime minister brian mulroneys conservative government has been 
more equivocal on the issue under pressure from exporters whose 
goods cost more as the dollar appreciates nearly 80 percent of 
canadian exports go to the united states 
finance minister michael wilson said last week that interest 
rates may dip as soon as inflation falls below 4 percent 
but exporters concerns were undermined this week when the 
government reported betterthanexpected merchandise trade figures 
for january canadas surplus of 633 million dollars or 506 
million us was up from decembers surplus of 207 million 
dollars or 165 million 
key canadian interest rates such as for eurodollar deposits 
are 15 percent higher than us dollar rates 
other factors behind the canadian currencys rise include the 
anticipated strengthening of oil and commodity prices in the wake 
of us troop deployment in honduras and the closing of the 
transpanama oil pipeline riley said

a strike by electrical workers cut off 
power to the transpanama oil pipeline wednesday halting the flow 
of alaska north slope crude oil to markets on the us gulf coast 
state officials said 
electrical service was restored early thursday but then was 
interrupted again prompting the panamanian government to announce 
it was taking over all public utilities 
the pipeline carries 650000 barrels a day of alaska oil 
roughly 10 percent of us domestic production a barrel is 
equivalent to 42 gallons 
bp america inc and its subsidiary sohio oil own twothirds to 
threequarters of the oil flowing through the pipeline the rest is 
owned by exxon co usa 
the flow was halted at 2 pm est wednesday when electrical 
workers joined a widespread strike against gen manuel antonio 
noriega said tim reynolds a bp america spokesman in washington 
dc the strike cut off power to a pump station at the foot of a 
mountain he said 
bp america has a oneday supply of oil already on the gulf of 
mexico side of panama and does not expect to initiate contingency 
plans yet reynolds said 
nonetheless we are taking steps to set up a shiptoship 
transfer operation so if necessary we can put at least some oil 
through the panama canal he said 
bp america is not sure how much oil it could move through the 
canal the amount would depend on the availability of small tankers 
and canal congestion reynolds said 
state officials the alaska congressional delegation and oil 
companies also are studying alternatives including taking the oil 
around africas cape horn or getting a waiver to the federal ban on 
exports of alaska oil 
state officials have been worried about a panama pipeline 
shutdown because it could slow sales of alaska crude which account 
for the bulk of state revenues 
west coast oil markets are glutted with alaska oil and the 
federal export ban prevents its sale overseas 
chuck logsdon chief oil revenue analyst for the state said the 
gulf coast markets have been handling more than 600000 barrels of 
the total daily alaska production of 18 million to 19 million 
barrels

an increase in mortgage foreclosure and 
delinquency rates in texas is further evidence of regional economic 
problems the mortgage bankers association said 
the nationwide foreclosure and delinquency rates are improving 
but mba spokesman tom marder said the figures released wednesday 
show that economic problems remain particularly in the oil and 
farm states 
the trend nationally for two years has been toward lower 
delinquency and foreclosure rates marder said obviously some 
of the regional problems still exist 
the associations figures show that at the end of the last 
quarter 156 percent of the mortgages surveyed in texas were in 
foreclosure up from 153 percent for the same period last year 
this gives texas the ninthhighest foreclosure rate in the 
nation 
another 872 percent were at least 30 days delinquent as of 
december a substantial increase from the 792 percent delinquent 
as of the year before 
foreclosures nationwide represented 106 percent of the total 
home loans and 537 percent of the loans were delinquent 
the association speculated three months ago that problems in the 
oil patch appeared to be drying up after an improvement in the 
third quarter in that quarter the survey showed 119 percent of 
the loans in texas were in foreclosure and another 764 percent 
were delinquent 
the mba reported that although some regions have had 
disappointing foreclosure and delinquency levels the solutions 
to these regional problems are of a longterm nature there is 
reason to expect delinquencies to resume their previous downward 
trend in due course 
alaska and wyoming ranked first and second on the list of 
foreclosure and delinquency rates while rhode island was last 
alaska which also has been severely affected by the plunge in 
oil prices had 592 percent mortgages in foreclosure up from 355 
percent for the same period of last year alaskas delinquencies 
also increased to 1185 percent in the past quarter up from 1018 
percent 
next on the list was wyoming with 539 percent in foreclosure 
last quarter a decline from 584 percent in the same period of 
last year wyoming also saw a slight improvement in its delinquent 
loans to 626 percent a decline from the 790 registered last 
year in the same quarter 
rhode island had the lowest foreclosure rate of all states at 
009 percent

west germany officially gave its 
support to the proposed establishment of a western european central 
bank that would be independent of common market governments 
finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said thursday that the 
12nation common market should free all movements of capital within 
its borders and strengthen the european monetary system in its 
efforts to achieve closer economic cooperation and integration 
free capital movement without controls and limitations is the 
most important monetary policy reform for the near future 
stoltenberg said 
in a memorandum prepared for his fellow cabinet ministers and 
other western european governments stoltenberg reaffirmed west 
germanys commitment to closer economic integration among the 
member nations of the european economic community 
he also said that at the end of the process there should be a 
european central bank 
stoltenbergs statement came less than three weeks after west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher proposed setting up 
a european committee of experts to outline a course of action for 
further european economic integration 
the document adds further momentum to a discussion that started 
late last year when french economics minister edouard balladur 
proposed establishing a european central bank 
stoltenberg said in his memorandum that a european central bank 
should be committed to price stability and should be independent of 
both common market authorities and member governments 
the central bank issue is expected to be discussed at the eec 
summit in hanover west germany on june 27 and 28

sen howard metzenbaum dohio warned cable 
television operators thursday that congress will consider 
reregulating the industry if rates continue to rise and programming 
is withheld from competitors 
some of us feel we were had by the congressional decision 
that freed most cable operators of municipal rate control in 
january 1987 and let them set their own prices metzenbaum said 
this congress is ready to reexamine that whole issue said 
metzenbaum at a hearing of the senate judiciarys subcommittee on 
antitrust monopolies and business rights which he chairs 
metzenbaum the only senator present during much of the hearing 
said congress is concerned that cable tv operators an 11 billion 
a year industry that serves 51 percent of american households 
enjoy a monopoly that can freeze out competing tv distribution 
systems and raise prices 
james p mooney president of the national cable television 
association disputed metzenbaums charge that cable prices have 
zoomed upwards by up to 400 percent in some areas since 
deregulation 
mooney said an ncta study shows that the average cable 
subscribers monthly bill rose 67 percent in the first six months 
after deregulation while basic service prices rose about 106 
percent rates for premium or pay channels like home box office 
dropped 25 percent according to the study 
mooney said that while some people saw large increases in their 
rates as cable companies realigned their services most people paid 
only a small increase and also received more channels than they did 
before deregulation 
metzenbaum also said he was concerned about complaints by cable 
competitors that distribute tv programming via microwave and 
satellite that they are being strangled by the cable industrys 
control over programming 
cable operators have a stake in many of the major satellite 
programmers like hbo showtime turner broadcasting and mtv he 
said 
george kocian spokesman for the home satellite television 
association which represents owners and dealers of home satellite 
dishes told the committee the cable industry has tried to prevent 
the growth of the home dish market by controlling access to and the 
price of programming 
about 2 million households receive tv directly from backyard 
dishes most programming is now scrambled so a dish owner must 
purchase a decoder costing about 400 to unscramble the signals 
kocian said the association does not oppose scrambling but he 
said dish owners should not have to pay the same prices as cable 
subscribers since they have to incur more of the cost of service 
like buying a decoder and maintaining their dish antenna 
consumers are willing to pay a fair price he said but we 
are not being treated fairly or equally 
joseph collins president of hbo the nations largest pay tv 
company said backyard dish owners can subscribe to hbos scrambled 
signal directly from hbo or from a cable operator dish subscribers 
pay about twothirds the price that cable subscribers do he said 
there is no denial of access he said 
however he said the company has had problems with 
microwavebased tv delivery systems that distribute hbo programming 
unscrambled in such cases nonsubscribers with an appropriate 
antenna can intercept these transmissions and watch hbo for free 
he said

opec president rilwanu lukman said 
thursday he will announce new measures to bring stability to 
dropping oil prices on march 22 
lukmans twoparagraph statement did not say what the measures 
would involve the statement said the measures would be announced 
at a 1000 am 4 am est press conference and should bring 
stability to the volatile oil market 
on tuesday lukman accused the western press of trying to 
destabilize the oil market to bring down prices he said opec would 
not be stampeded into taking emergency measures to stop the fall of 
oil prices 
he said the cartel would stand firm on its decision to produce 
156 million barrels of oil a day a barrel is the equivalent of 42 
gallons 
ministry sources who declined to be identified said lukman 
would call an emergency opec meeting soon after the march 22 press 
conference if consultations between members promised meaningful 
discussion at the meeting 
the sources said price stability would be the main topic of 
discussion if the meeting were held a report by a private audit 
team on the level of oil production among cartel members would also 
be an issue

grain and soybean futures prices posted strong 
gains thursday on the chicago board of trade

much as a nickel 
a large speculator bought sizeable amounts of beans and soybean 
products to offset earlier sales said dale gustafson an analyst 
with drexel burnham lambert inc 
that ignited it he said it prompted a lot of short 
covering by commission houses 
corn and wheat futures were helped by the rally in beans said 
gustafson 
wheat also did well because there are indications the chinese 
are chartering some vessels so maybe theres some new buying 
coming in he said 
on the close wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 297 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with march at 199 a bushel oats were 2

the securities and exchange commission dealt 
rh macy amp co incs bid for federated department stores inc a 
setback today by recommending to a federal judge that campeau 
corps revised tender offer for federated be regarded as an 
amendment to a previous offer rather than a new bid 
if the judge agrees the campeau bid could expire as scheduled 
more than two weeks before macys competing offer macy fears that 
federated shareholders will feel pressured to tender their shares 
to campeau because of the earlier deadline 
in a friend of the court brief the sec told us district 
judge leonard sand the revised bid announced by campeau march 2 was 
not a new offer and as such did not have to remain open for 20 
business days past its publication 
the revised offer changed the number of shares campeau was 
seeking and the price to be paid for those shares 
macy has asked sand to declare the latest campeau bid a new 
offer which would keep it open past its scheduled expiration 
campeau announced today it was extending its offer beyond friday 
to midnight march 22 however sand ruled earlier this week that 
both companies offers must remain open for three business days 
after his decision on the macy challenge and on a campeau suit that 
seeks to invalidate federateds shareholders rights plan 
sand had sought the sec opinion on the macy argument it was not 
known when he would make his ruling 
macy had no comment on the secs opinion said maureen milano a 
spokeswoman for the retailer 
a campeau spokeswoman joele frank said were pleased about 
the secs opinion but its really up to the judge 
macy whose bid expires on april 4 wants a later expiration for 
the campeau offer because it would put the competing bids on a more 
equal footing 
campeau claimed its offer cannot go forward while the rights 
plan known as a poison pill remains in effect the plan 
allows current federated shareholders to buy more of the companys 
stock at a steep discount making a takeover prohibitively 
expensive 
macy is offering 7735 a share in cash for 7043 million 
federated shares for a total of 63 billion macy will exchange 
shares in the merged company and issue convertible debt securities 
for the remainder of federateds 895 million outstanding shares 
campeau is offering 75 in cash per share for 705 million 
federated shares or a total of 618 billion the remaining of 
federated stock would be acquired later for 44 cash per share in a 
subsequent merger giving the deal an aggregate value of 68 per 
share

managers at fairfax publications us ltd 
said thursday they are negotiating to buy ms and sassy magazines 
from the companys australian parent 
john fairfax ltd of sydney which acquired ms in september and 
launched sassy five months later officially put the magazines on 
the block wednesday it was not known who else might be bidding for 
the properties 
sandra yates president of fairfax us said she and vice 
president anne summers began discussing a managementled buyout 
with executives in australia last december yates said a bid is now 
on the table although she declined to reveal any figures 
yates labeled as optimistic rumors that the australian 
company paid as much as 15 million for ms which was founded by 
gloria steinem and pat carbine 16 years ago 
in an interview last month yates acknowledged that startup 
costs for sassy a monthly magazine aimed at teenage american 
girls totaled 10 million 
the decision to sell the magazines is part of a wider sale of 
assets to help finance the privatization of john fairfax ltd 
twentysixyearold warwick fairfax who took his fathers 
company private last december had to borrow significant funds to 
buy out shareholders and has a large debt and needs to liquidate 
assets yates explained 
mr fairfax has announced other belttightening measures at 
company holdings in both australia and london 
ms circulation is holding steady at about 484000 copies a 
month yates said sassy was expected to have an initial 
circulation of 250000 and a goal of 1 million within five years 
because only two issues of sassy have been published it is too 
early to assess its circulation 
yates said both the acquisition of the badly undercapitalized 
ms and the launching of sassy by fairfax were her idea so 
obviously ive always been very firmly convinced they could work 
still both magazines will require a substantial amount of 
investment over the next couple of years many millions of dollars 
before they come into profit because one is a turnaround and the 
other is a startup yates said 
she said she did not think finding investors would be a problem

japan overtook the united states last year in 
economic output per person according to a report thursday that 
highlighted that nations relentless rise as an economic superpower 
the report by japans economic planning agency was the latest in 
a string of reports on the island nations growing wealth for 
example the tokyo stock exchange has become the worlds largest 
and most of the worlds largest banks are japanese 
the agency said japans percapita gross national product the 
output of goods and services for each member of the population 
reached the equivalent of 19642 in 1987 compared with 18403 in 
the united states 
japans ascendance was made possible partly by a strong 42 
percent increase in its total gross national product more 
important though was a 17 percent rise in the value of the 
japanese yen vs the dollar from one year to the next 
when the yen is strong it makes japans economic output more 
valuable in terms of dollars it also increases japans financial 
muscle in the united states and other markets 
as an economic power the united states has already been 
surpassed ezra vogel a harvard university expert in east asian 
affairs said in reaction to the report 
the critical question is who has the leverage who has the 
strategy who has the critical assets that influence the course of 
world economic development vogel said 
the key people who are able to make new loans are the 
japanese people begin to look to the rules of the game as the 
lender defines it he said 
unfortunately its continuing to happen he added japan 
is continuing to collect more chips and the united states is 
continuing to lose chips 
the report drew a different reaction from japanese observers 
who contended it gives an unrealistic picture because it is based 
on what they regard as an overvaluation of the japanese yen vs the 
dollar 
its kind of magic numerical magic it has no sense in real 
life said yoshihisa kitai the economist in the new york office 
of the longterm credit bank of japan 
japan has indeed grown wealthier but the japanese people still 
feel poor when they compare their buying power with that of 
americans kitai said land costs are high because of 
overprotection of farmland and an inefficient distribution system 
keeps retail prices high he said 
in 1986 when calculations were based on 1 trading at 16851 
yen the us gross national product per capita was 17464 and 
japans was 16330 in 1987 the calculations were based on 1 for 
14462 yen the dollar currently is trading at about 127 yen 
it is difficult to tell what nation has the highest gross 
national product per capita because of drastic fluctuations from 
year to year caused by exchangerate shifts and the rise and fall

the united arab emirates was the worlds leader in 1985 at 
19120 per capita followed by the sultanate of brunei at 17580 
the united states at 16400 and switzerland at 16380 according 
to world bank atlas 1987 japan ranked well back at 11330 the 
atlas said 
although more recent numbers are not available it is known that 
the oilproducing nations have fallen in rank because of lower oil 
prices while western europe and japan have risen because of 
stronger currencies 
japan had about 122 million people as of the middle of last 
year half of the united states 244 million but its economic 
output is more than half that of the united states 
japans inflationadjusted gnp growth of 42 percent in the 
calendar year 1987 was up from 24 percent the previous year 
helped by gains in housing and industrial equipment investment 
the economic planning agency said japans gnp grew by an 
inflationadjusted 17 percent in the octoberdecember quarter from 
the julyseptember quarter 
the agency said the governments target of 37 percent growth 
for fiscal 1987 which ends march 31 was in reach 
the original target was 35 percent but it was revised upward 
in december based on signs of an encouraging recovery in the 
manufacturing sector manufacturing earlier had been slumping 
because of the yens rise which makes japanese products more 
expensive and less competitive abroad

a food and medical supply irradiation 
company pleaded guilty wednesday to covering up safety violations 
and authorities revealed that its founder a leading spokesman for 
the preservation process was negotiating a plea arrangement with 
prosecutors 
radiation technology inc admitted that a false memorandum 
saying it had stopped bypassing safety measures at its rockaway 
plant was prepared and given to nuclear regulatory commission 
investigators 
both the company and federal authorities have said no employees 
or members of the public were injured because of the violations 
the morris plains company represented by its president allan 
booth also admitted telling the nrc that a radiation safety 
monitor was removed for only one night when it was actually removed 
for several days while the plant was irradiating products 
radiation technology which also has plants in west memphis 
ark haw river nc and salem uses radioactive cobalt60 to 
sterilize medical supplies and foodstuffs mainly spices 
on tuesday prosecutors said thomas powell who worked as 
operations manager at the rockaway plant from 1980 to 1985 pleaded 
guilty to related charges 
powell admitted conspiring with others to have employees bypass 
devices called conveyor door safety interlocks required under its 
license the safety locks automatically lower the highly 
radioactive cobalt60 materials into a safety pool if they sense 
the presence of people powell faces five years in prison said 
assistant us attorney jacqueline wolff 
the company which faces a 1 million penalty admitted that 
company officials prepared and backdated a memo dated sept 21 
1984 falsely saying that its employees had been ordered to stop 
bypassing the interlock system 
during a hearing us district judge maryanne trump barry asked 
if there was a problem with plea negotiations with the companys 
founder and former chairman martin welt 
ms wolff responded that welt had signed a plea agreement 
admitting to related charges but had decided not to enter the plea 
later ms wolff said welts attorneys and her office had been 
negotiating over a plea and that she did not know the reason why 
welt did not enter it 
welt has spoken frequently in the national media about the value 
of food irradiation and even traveled to china last year to 
promote the process 
welt was forced to sever his links to radiation technology in 
mid1986 along with powell after the nrc briefly suspended the 
companys license for the interlock safety violations 
ms wolff said the safety systems were bypassed to keep the 
business going 
the interlocks were not operating properly the thing to do is 
shut it down she said 
in a prepared statement the company said 
by this guilty plea rti has acknowledged its legal 
responsibility for the actions of an officer who submitted false 
information to the nrc relating to known deficiences in equipment 
designed to insure operator safety at rtis rockaway facility 
the company referred all further comment including who the 
official was to its public relations firm solakian associates 
mary solakian said she was not familiar enough with wednesdays 
hearing to comment and said her husband was out of the office and 
could not be reached 
in exchange for the companys guilty plea the government agreed 
not to further prosecute the firm on the matter and take no 
position on sentencing unless the judge asks said ms wolff

back interest payments on brazilian loans could 
add 250 million to citicorps 1988 earnings chairman and chief 
executive officer john s reed said wednesday 
citicorp the nations largest bank holding company with assets 
of 2036 billion is the leader of negotiations between banks and 
the brazilian government aimed at restructuring that countrys debt 
i believe brazil is likely to reach an agreement with the 
banks but it is difficult to be assured of it reed told a news 
conference before a luncheon address to the economic club of 
detroit 
whatever the success of the debtrestructuring talks brazils 
resumption of interest payments will be a boost reed said 
and he said we are quite positive about our own situation 
they have paid the interest for the fourth quarter of last 
year they are paying now the interest due for the first quarter of 
this year but no one has booked it yet he said we are short 
200 million after tax 333 million before tax from brazil so we 
have the potential of booking in this year onequarter billion 
dollars 
brazil which owes more than 112 billion abroad and has not 
repaid any principal since 1983 stopped paying interest on bank 
debts in february 1987 
citicorp was the first bank to respond in may 1987 by boosting 
loanloss reserves increasing them during the year by about 3 
billion 
that and other steps confused citicorps earnings picture 
for 1987 reed said citicorp reported a loss of 113 billion for 
1987 compared with net income of 105 billion in 1986 
in 1988 he said we expect to return to a normal year 
reed said predictions of slower consumerspending growth this 
year may have been excessively conservative as indicated by 
healthy auto sales and home mortgage activity thus far 
mortgage applications to citicorp which accounts for 6 percent 
of the nations singlefamily home loans have been higher than 
expected in the past 30 days he said

that chrysler has settled on the tentative date for the start of 
talks on a contract covering 59500 active and 8000 laidoff 
workers and wants a settlement deadline for sometime in june 
uaw spokesman bob barbee said the date wont be confirmed until 
uaw vice president marc stepp is sure it will fit into a schedule 
crammed with negotiations with other companies including general 
dynamics 
in general barbee said it sounds reasonable 
but st john chryslers vice president for human resources 
also has a conflict hes been called to jury duty in oakland 
county circuit court for april 1819 
im trying to get out of jury duty he said this is my 
third summons i asked to postpone one to attend a board meeting 
as a lawyer he began his labor relations career arguing cases

automatically excluded from jury duty in most states but not in 
michigan

prepare demands its 140member national chrysler council meets 
april 57 in missouri to approve them

begin in midjuly but chrysler asked for the early start after the 
uaw forced it to reverse a plan to sell its 28000worker acustar 
inc parts subsidiary 
in cooperative unionmanagement programs that reach from the 
executive suite to the plant floor the two sides have begun 
working together to find ways to improve chryslers production 
quality and efficiency 
they are considered crucial to the survival of any auto company 
battling for its share of an intensely competitive market but 
negotiations tend to put everything into a kind of holding 
pattern st john said 
chrysler will work within the jobprotecting pattern contracts 
established for the industry last fall at ford motor co and 
general motors corp but will try to mold the pattern to 
chryslers needs he said

the nations factories mines and utilities 
operated at 824 percent of capacity in february the third 
consecutive month the operating rate has been at that level the 
federal reserve said thursday 
even though the february rate was the same as december and 
january those two months were revised up slightly in the newest 
report a fact that private economists said was encouraging 
slowly but surely capacity utilization is marching higher 
showing that the industrial sector remains strong said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co 
before the revision the operating rate in december and january 
had been put at 822 percent 
the report said that the february operating rate was held back 
by further cutbacks in production at auto plants and a big drop in 
coal production 
before the year began analysts expressed fears that the economy 
could weaken significantly due to widespread cutbacks in production 
as businesses tried to work off a huge supply of unsold goods which 
had been built up in the last part of 1987 
while high inventories have led to cuts in auto production many 
other industries such as textiles chemicals and paper have 
continued to have high operating rates 
analysts have recently been boosting their forecasts for growth 
in the first quarter of 1988 based on a belief that the weakness 
from production cutbacks was overstated 
manufacturing which was in a virtual recession in 1985 and 1986 
because of the countrys large trade deficit began to rebound last 
year as the weaker dollar made american products competitive once 
again on overseas markets 
continued strength in manufacturing this year is expected to be 
the principal force keeping the country out of a recession 
the 824 percent industrial operating rate is the highest 
overall operating rate since march 1980 the operating rate plunged 
to 695 percent during the depths of the 198182 recession 
in february the operating rate at manufacturing plants remained 
unchanged at 824 percent of capacity reflecting an operating rate 
of 801 percent at factories making durable goods and a production 
rate of 859 percent of capacity at plants making nondurable goods 
paper a nondurable good had the highest operating rate of any 
industry at 958 percent of capacity with textile plants close 
behind at 919 percent and chemical plants at 865 percent 
auto plants operated at 77 percent of capacity in february down 
from 774 percent in january and a full 5 percentage points below 
the operating rate in october sales have rebounded in recent weeks 
and analysts believe that auto operating rates should start to move 
higher 
the mining industry operated at 806 percent of capacity in 
february down from 811 percent in january the decline was 
attributed to a drop in production at coal mines 
us utilities operated at 822 percent of capacity last month 
up from 817 percent in january 
the overall operating rate of 824 percent was more than two 
percentage points higher than the 797 percent operating rate in 
february 1987
