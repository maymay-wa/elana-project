bob ploeger will have a welldocumented 
fish story to tell when he gets back home to minnesota 
as with most fish stories it will be about the one that got away 
but this one is on the record ploeger attracted the attention of 
local news photographers and hundreds of onlookers as he battled a 
king salmon for nearly a day and a half before losing the fish and 
perhaps a world record 
the length of the struggle coupled with the way the fish dragged 
boats up down and across the river prompted speculation that it 
might have been the king of kings the sportcaught salmon that 
finally would top the 100pound mark 
kings that big have been caught commercially in cook inlet near 
the mouth of the kenai but the biggest ever taken on a rod and reel 
was 97 pounds 4 ounces 
the struggle began just after noon wednesday when the 63yearold 
ploeger a retired jailer from sandstone minn hooked the fish 
about four miles upstream from the soldotna bridge in southcentral 
alaska about 75 miles southwest of anchorage 
ploeger was fishing from a drift boat with a rookie guide dan 
bishop 
ploeger and bishop soon abandoned the drift boat hopping aboard 
a passing powerboat after bishop was unable to maneuver adequately 
through some boulderstudded rapids 
he fought the fish that quickly was dubbed the boss hog 
through the night and all day thursday 
as word of the fish spread the crowds grew local restaurants 
and businesses offered food and drink to ploeger and the people 
helping him other guides shuttled fuel to the boat 
ploeger said there were hours of boredom punctuated by 
heartstopping runs when the fish decided to go somewhere else 
at one point they thought they had him 
he started coming up said pat cooper another guide 
recruited along the way we thought he was worn out but he must 
have gotten scared by the net 
by thursday evening the shoreline was lined with people some 
brought lawn chairs others fished themselves at 836 pm they 
erupted in cheers when it seemed a world record had been set for the 
longest battle with a sport fish 
according to the guiness book of world records a fisherman took 
32 hours to land a 1600pound marlin in new zealand ploeger had 
that beat if he could land the fish 
but about four hours later in the murky twilight that passes for 
night during alaska summers the fish escaped leaving ploeger and 
everyone else wondering how big it really was

a top aide to former housing secretary samuel 
pierce disputes pierces sworn claim that he had no direct role in 
deciding what projects the scandalscarred agency funded 
former hud assistant secretary for housing shirley mcvay wiseman 
also says carla hills currently the us trade representative 
lobbied pierce to lift restrictions on a mortgage lender now under 
federal criminal investigation 
hills is scheduled to testify before the committee on monday 
wiseman said in sworn testimony friday that pierce personally 
called her and instructed her to approve more than 15 million in 
funding for a durham nc project sought by a former pierce law 
partner 
pierce said i want the project funded wiseman told the 
house government operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
one of three congressional panels investigating mismanagement and 
fraud at the housing agency 
the hud approval brought more than 113 million in rent 
subsidies a 23 million grant and more than 3 million in tax 
credits to developers who were seeking to turn a hosiery mill into 
an apartment complex said rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of 
the subcommittee 
pierce has testified he set up a threeperson panel to make 
funding decisions for the moderate rehabilitation program but said 
he maintained final authority over the decisions 
i did not plan however to get into the decisionmaking 
process of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing 
so he told the subcommittee in may 
efforts by the associated press to reach pierce for comment were 
unsuccessful lantos said he would seek to recall pierce to the 
subcommittee before the congressional recess aug 4 
wiseman said she told pierce she could not fund the project over 
the objections of career hud employees who had been violently 
opposed to the project 
the project was eventually approved by wisemans successor janet 
hale who said she believed she was acting on the approval of my 
boss 
wiseman also testified that drg funding corp a private lender 
that was suspended from participating in a 5 billion program in 
which hud insured large portions of mortgages was allowed to get 
back into the program after lobbying from hills a former hud 
secretary 
drg is now under fbi criminal investigation 
wiseman said drgs ability to underwrite mortgages had been 
placed on hold during the reagan administration because of 
infractions of department rules the suspension remained despite a 
meeting with hills in late 1984 or early 1985 to get the 
restrictions lifted 
it was not a convincing argument wiseman said 
but drgs probation was lifted despite the concerns of staff 
members she said it was later brought to my attention that hills 
had taken the case to secretary pierce i was informed by staff 
that there was a meeting she said 
lawmakers expressed concern about the conflicting testimony 
regarding pierce 
the factual noose seems to be tightening around samuel pierces 
neck said rep charles schumer dny 
we were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried to 
influence any project and we have two people making it very clear 
that he wanted a particular project funded said rep christopher 
shays rconn 
meanwhile hud filed suit in forth worth texas on friday 
seeking to recover more than 25 million a texas woman is accused 
of bilking from the agency and spending on real estate cars and 
guns the woman is one of 10 closing agents nationwide the agency 
believes defrauded hud of about 10 million

a new york executive accused of pumping money 
into the campaign of a former governor of guam in exchange for a 
political favor pleaded guilty friday to three counts of mail fraud 
arthur abba goldberg entered the plea before us district judge 
jesse curtis said guams us attorney bill oconnor in exchange 
for his guilty plea 46 counts alleging bribery conspiracy wire 
and mail fraud and violation of interstate racketeering statutes 
were dismissed 
in dismissing the counts the guam issues were dissolved 
oconnor said other issues are on the table if another 
jurisdiction sees fit to follow through 
twelve of the counts were related directly to guam a us 
territory since august 1950 said oconnor the balance of the 
counts related to fraud involving use of the commercial bank of 
americas in transactions that did not involve guam oconnor said 
although goldberg executive vice president of the new york bond 
underwriting firm of matthews amp wright only pleaded to three of the 
dozen counts oconnor was satisfied with the outcome 
mr goldbergs plea gave the same latitude of sentencing than 
if he went to trial oconnor said we of course will 
recommend jail time and a heavy fine 
goldberg faces a possible 15 years imprisonment a 750000 fine 
and restitution payments oconnor said in a telephone interview 
from his santa ana office sentencing was scheduled in curtis court 
sept 11 
one of goldbergs attorneys howard l weitzman said he had no 
immediate comment a receptionist who answered a call made after 
business hours to another defense attorney bruce hochman said 
hochman had gone for the day 
the three mail fraud counts concerned 57500 bilked from the 
guam program development fund and a letter assuring fund authorities 
that transactions were above board while fraud was taking place 
goldberg prepared phony invoices that were sent to the bank 
entrusted with fund money the bank paid the money goldberg 
exerted for his purposes and he attempted to cover up later with 
false papers in the files oconnor said 
oconnor said 25000 was used to buy campaign paraphernalia 
parasols hats shirts junk like that for guam gov ricardo j 
bordallos unsuccessful 1986 reelection bid 
the funds were funneled to bordallo after he was promised the 
money in exchange for his support on a bond issue 300 million of 
which was sold by matthews amp wright 
the bond was approved by the guam legislature in 1985 matthews amp 
wright deny any wrongdoing 
bordallo was acquitted in february 1986 of accepting bribes 
from goldberg but convicted on 10 counts of government corruption 
the case is among about 25 municipal bond deals nationwide 
involving matthews amp wright under investigation by the securities 
and exchange commission

the leader of the nations 300 roman catholic 
bishops admits there are persistent elements of racism in the 
church but is calling for a black priests breakaway congregation 
to return for the sake of unity 
archbishop john may of st louis president of the national 
conference of catholic bishops promised the rev george a 
stallings jr the nations two million black catholics would be 
given full voice in the church 
it is possible to be a voice of conscience for the family 
and lead that family from within may said in a statement friday 
stallings 41 has been suspended for holding services the past 
two weeks at his imani temple in defiance of washington cardinal 
james hickey 
a spokesman for stallings said he would have no comment on mays 
statement or another call for unity from the nations 13 black 
bishops earlier this week 
stallings has said he formed the new congregation because the 
catholic church has not addressed black concerns and he has charged 
the church with racism 
mays statement conceded surely as all the bishops in this 
country have acknowledged in the past there have been elements of 
racism in the church and there continue to be 
we need to recognize more black leadership our liturgies need 
more of the vibrancy and our policies more of the insight of 
african americans may said 
he said the nations 52 million roman catholics share the 
sadness reflected in the black bishops call wednesday for 
reconciliation 
the black bishops statement said in part we sincerely hope 
stallings followers are not commingling personal disappointment 
individually felt frustrations and personal anger under the banner 
of racism racism is a sin which the church must address it is too 
serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns 
several priests have supported stallings however including 15 
who met with him in chicago thursday they called for hickey to lift 
stallings suspension imposed after the first service of the 
renegade church at howard university on july 2 
appearing friday on the oprah winfrey show stallings denied he 
is forming the church for personal gain i know exactly the 
picture theyre trying to paint but martin luther king jr 
malcolm x jesse jackson people say they all have inflated egos 
stallings said on the national television program 
he affirmed his plans to continue services despite the 
suspension and said he cannot be excommunicated from jesus 
christ 
stallings said hickey should eat crow and admit hes 
wrong 
since the roman catholic church cannot make inroads into the 
black community all we are saying is let us show you how whats 
wrong with that he asked 
suspension means stallings is not sanctioned to say mass or 
perform other sacraments it is the strongest step hickey can take 
without moving to excommunicate stallings

officials are investigating the pilot who 
survived an 800mile flight bullet wound and crashlanding in the 
ocean expanding probes that began when three dozen guns and a can 
of ether were found in thomas roots private plane 
the reports that the washington communications lawyer is under 
investigation by several agencies added a peculiar twist to the tale 
of roots rescue from the atlantic ocean after apparently crashing 
unconscious into the water 
officials at agencies said root is being investigated by the us 
customs service over the weapons and ether the north carolina 
secretary of states office concerning possible securities 
violations the national transportation safety board and the fbi 
which investigates crimes aboard aircraft 
widespread publicity over roots unlikely survival prompted 
customs to expand its investigation friday into miami and north 
carolina 
this is weird to say the least said a customs official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
in addition a review of documents at the federal communications 
commission showed root repeatedly failed to comply with deadlines 
and other requirements in cases before the commission 
root also represented numerous clients of a georgiabased company 
that another broadcast firm labeled a notorious application mill 
for fm broadcast licenses that allegedly has bilked hundreds of 
individuals of their investments 
the 35 guns many loaded were found during a search april 24 by 
federal and local officials of roots cessna 210 at the manassas 
va airport said the customs official 
all the guns were legal under federal law and all but one a 
machine gun root had registered with the federal bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms but not with virginia authorities were legal 
under state law the state has filed a misdemeanor charge against 
him over the machine gun the official said 
among the guns including assaultstyle weapons and three 
357caliber magnums the officials found silencers ammunition 
clips handcuffs an electrical stun gun and a fivegallon can of 
ether which is used in cocaine production in the plane the 
customs official said 
during a may 31 interview with root by prince william county 
polie and a customs agent by and large he was able to account for 
legal possession of those weapons 
basically he indicated that he was a gun collector the 
official said but root did not explain why he kept the weapons on 
his plane registered to a washingtonbased company he owns nor 
why they were loaded 
root told officials the ether was used to clean his aircraft 
but of course thats not what you use to clean an aircraft with 
unless youre going to blow it up the official said 
customs kept the case open because when you come across this 
many weapons we always continue to take a look to make sure no 
customs laws have been violated he said 
the search had been prompted by an unidentified source who said 
there was a suspicious aircraft at manassas airfield the 
customs official said 
hollywood fla police chief richard witt revealed friday that 
root had been shot the bullet traveled through his left rib cage 
and his colon left his body and then pierced his arm a powder 
burn indicated root was shot at close range the chief said 
in north carolina secretary of state rufus edmisten said his 
office had spoken with root about a securities investigation 
involving georgiabased sonrise management services and that the 
lawyer knew he was under investigation 
sonrise said in a statement that the only connection between the 
company and root is that he represents certain entities which also 
number among our clientele 
edmisten said root was the attorney for investment partnerships 
formed by sonrise to obtain fcc licenses 
meanwhile national transportation safety board spokeswoman 
rachel halterman said investigators have not come to any 
conclusions and have not ruled out anything at all about what 
caused the events on the plane thursday

an organization investigated by the fbi during 
its protests of us policies in central america says a senate 
intelligence committee report criticizing the fbi probe didnt go 
far enough 
hugh byrne political director of the committee in solidarity 
with the people of el salvador praised the senate for calling the 
fbi surveillance of his organization unjustified and telling the 
agency to purge its files of the case 
but we take strong issue with its conclusion that the fbi 
investigation was an aberration and that it wasnt politically 
motivated byrne said friday after the intelligence committee 
issued a report criticizing the fbis investigation of cispes 
between 1983 and 1985 
the report sharply criticized fbi management for letting the 
investigation continue and said the probe was based on allegations 
that should not have been considered credible 
the cispes files contain information about domestic political 
activities that the fbi should never have gathered said sen 
david boren dokla intelligence committee chairman and sen 
william cohen rmaine vice chairman 
that information must be removed from fbi records so it cannot 
be used to damage the reputation of innocent persons they said 
but the report called the investigation an aberration and 
said it did not reflect significant fbi political or ideological 
bias a point noted by both cispes and the fbi 
we dont believe that an investigation that involved 59 field 
officers and 178 spinoff investigations that resulted in retrievable 
information being held in fbi files about approximately 2375 
individuals and 1330 groups can be called an aberration said 
byrne 
we believe the investigation was politically motivated from the 
start said byrne 
the fbi said director william sessions is still reviewing the 
report but issued a statement saying it was significant that the 
report found the cispes investigation was not politically 
motivated to harass or influence legitimate first amendment 
activities 
an fbi spokesman said the files would not be immediately purged 
because there is continuing litigation over the investigation 
the committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador was 
formed in 1980 because of reagan administration aid to el salvador 
which has totaled 3 billion since 1981 
a 1983 fbi memorandum is quoted in the report as attacking cispes 
for its protests and its practice of hosting salvadoran refugees who 
said their lives had been threatened by death squads in their 
homelands 
it is imperative at this time to formulate some plan of attack 
against cispes and specifically against individuals who 
defiantly display their contempt for the us government by making 
speeches and propagandizing their cause while asking for political 
asylum the memo said 
the report said there may not have been tangible harm intended 
or done to any groups or individuals involved in constitutionally 
protected activity but unjustified investigations of political 
expression and dissent can have a debilitating effect upon our 
political system 
despite such comments the center for constitutional rights 
which filed a lawsuit on behalf of cispes said critical and 
unresolved issues relating to the monitoring of first 
amendmentprotected activities of domestic groups that oppose us 
policy remain 
the probe was done while william webster now director of the 
cia was head of the fbi 
sessions has taken several internal measures over the probe 
including disciplining six employees at the supervisor unit chief 
and section chief levels

a federal court ruling could make oil companies 
pay more to clean up oil spills including the massive spill from an 
exxon tanker that polluted the coastline of alaska says a 
congressman involved in the fight over liability for environmental 
accidents 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the district 
of columbia unanimously ruled friday the interior department should 
rewrite its rules on paying for oil spills to include the costs of 
more than just the monetary value of animals killed 
the decision raises chances that companies will have to pay the 
whole cost of restoring an environment said rep robert 
torricelli dnj 
torricelli said the case could have a major impact on damage 
payments by oil companies involved in spills such as the march 24 
accident that occurred when the tanker exxon valdez dumped 11 
million gallons of crude oil into alaskas pristine prince william 
sound 
this will make exxons exposure much greater said torricelli 
interior department spokesman al levitt said the agency hadnt 
studied the ruling and wouldnt have any comment he said no 
decision had been made on whether to appeal the case 
the regulations were issued three years ago to implement the 1977 
clean water act and the 1980 superfund law which required the 
government to write regulations determining the monetary costs of 
oil spills 
several environmental groups and states sued over the regulations 
under the 1986 regulations the interior department created a 
computer model putting a dollar value for lost use of various 
types of wildlife 
for example the cost of a fur seal was set at 15 based on the 
expected value of a seal pelt the cost of geese ranged up to 35 
based on their popularity among hunters 
but the appeals court said congress in writing the laws had 
intended that repayment should be more broadly drawn to consider not 
simply the value of lost wildlife but the larger cost of restoring 
the damaged environment 
because in some probably a majority of cases lostuse 
value will be lower than the cost of restoration interiors rule 
will result in damages awards too small to pay for the costs or 
restoration the ruling said 
the interior department has not yet decided on a damage 
assessment for either the alaskan spill or three smaller spills 
which occurred last month off the coasts of rhode island delaware 
and texas

stanley steamers chugged and puffed from 
lobster bakes to parades and museums as owners from all over the 
continent headed down east to pay tribute to the maine twins who 
invented the automobiles 
the gathering was to wind up friday evening with a blowdown 
banquet following a showing at a coastal transportation museum 
after operating their cars drivers blow down the boilers 
venting steam 
a day earlier more than 30 drivers made the trip to squirrel 
island where fe and fo stanley inventors of the celebrated 
steampowered cars used to spend summers 
in their first maine hub tour owners of stanley steamers and 
the lesscommon white steamers came from all over the continent 
three vehicles made it on their own steam while others made most of 
the trip on trailer beds 
a lot of these people came 700 or 800 miles said don bourdon 
of woodstock vt who made the 250mile trip in his 1913 stanley 
mountain wagon 
i would say this is the largest number of stanleys that have 
been running together said gordon smith of orillia ontario 
drivers must adjust valves to control water fuel throttle and 
steam pressure for the car to be ready to go a pilot light must be 
lit it takes about 20 minutes before a cold steamer will move 
of the roughly 400 stanley steamers nationwide about 150 are 
still roadworthy said bourdon 
stanley steamers were built between 1899 and 1924 in 
massachusetts it was a familyowned business until 1917 when fe 
stanley was killed in one of the steamers and the business was sold

the pentagon is studying results of a star 
wars test that is considered a key step in us research to deploy 
futuristic weapons that could shoot powerful beams at enemy missiles 
defense department officials on friday confirmed completion of 
the test which involved firing a beam of electrically neutral 
atomic particles into space for the first time 
the bear test which stands for the beam experiment aboard 
rocket is designed to test how an accelerator of neutral particles 
would work in space 
the experiment which has been planned for more than a year was 
completed early thursday morning at the white sands missile range in 
new mexico said army maj william oconnell a spokesman for the 
strategic defense initiative organization 
program scientists need to test whether neutral particle beams 
in this case hydrogen atoms can be used to discriminate between 
real and mock soviet warheads 
the spokesman said it was presumptive to announce whether the 
test had been a success since officials and scientists still need 
to study the results of the experiment over the weekend before 
releasing more information monday 
the experiment involved lifting into space just for a few 
minutes a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small aires 
rocket before the rocket returned to earth the accelerator was to 
be turned on for collection of data on how it worked and how the 
beam moved 
in june a similar test was aborted when the rocket failed to 
ignite on command 
the star wars program is a research effort aimed at developing 
lasers beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be 
used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the 
united states or its allies the pentagon and energy department are 
spending 4 billion on such research this year

a senior agriculture department scientist says 
the possibility that the socalled greenhouse effect will cause 
global warming is too much of a risk to ignore 
assistant secretary charles e hess who oversees science and 
education programs said friday he has named gary r evans as his 
special assistant for global change issues 
there are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought was 
evidence that global warming has already begun hess said a 
conclusive link has not been proven but the threat of global 
warming from heat trapped by socalled greenhouse gases is too much 
of a risk to ignore 
those gases include carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons methane 
nitrogen oxides and halons hess said in a statement some of the 
gases also seem to be causing a thinning of the highlevel ozone 
layer which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays which 
can limite the growth of sensitive crops 
evans who has been deputy administrator of the departments 
agricultural research service will coordinate activities among 
seven usda agencies and the landgrant universities as part of the 
departments efforts to protect crops and forests hess said

the fbi is investigating allegations of 
contract fraud at an ohio plant that makes material for nuclear 
weapons says a top energy department official 
the fernald plant where production was suspended earlier this 
week also is the target of a special investigation by a doe team 
assessing health and safety measures and other aspects of the 
plants operation 
fernalds been at the top of our list for some time said 
deputy energy secretary henson moore on friday were going in 
there to see whats wrong and what might need to be done to get into 
compliance 
fbi spokesman edwin boldt said from cincinnati that the 
investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing 
in contracting he provided 
no details 
the fernald complex located about 18 miles northwest of 
cincinnati is a key contributor to us nuclear weapons production 
it processes uranium compounds produces uranium billets for nuclear 
weapons production and makes uranium target elements for defense 
nuclear reactors 
its also one of the governments most seriously contaminated 
facilities 
the environmental protection agency this week proposed adding

the treasury department has published for 
public comment proposed rules that would allow president bush to 
plead national security and block takeover of a us firm by 
foreigners 
sen james exon dneb and rep james j florio dnj who 
were responsible for parts of the law praised the proposed 
regulations published friday in the federal register the comment 
period runs through sept 12 although the treasury department said 
later comments will be considered if possible 
the trade act signed by former president ronald reagan last 
august provides authority for the rules that would allow the 
president to block a merger if he has credible evidence that the 
foreign interest taking control might act to hurt us security if 
a president decides on an investigation he gets 30 days to begin 
it 45 days to complete it and another 15 days to announce it 
florio said the treasury has interpreted the law broadly to make 
sure that it covers a variety of ways that a foreign firm could take 
over an american one

the bush administration will announce a 
compensation offer early next week for families of the noniranian 
victims on the iran air flight shot down by a us warship a year 
ago officials say 
all but 40 of the 290 people who died were iranian the united 
states has said it would pay compensation to all families but the 
iranian government has refused to provide details about its citizens 
who died 
the 40 noniranians were indians pakistanis koreans japanese 
and citizens of several arab countries 
the us government has said it will not pay the iranian 
government directly and iran has called that position not 
acceptable 
in civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the united states 
courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of a 
family member thus families of people who die early in lucrative 
careers usually win larger awards than families of retired people 
it is not known whether such an approach would be followed in the 
governments compensation offer 
the officials who asked not to be identified on friday were 
unable to provide figures on the compensation package they expect 
but said a formal announcement was expected early next week

a gunshot wound suffered by thomas root is 
only one of the mysteries surrounding the attorney after he flew 
apparently unconscious 800 miles down the east coast 
officials from washington to florida hope to interview root today 
about the flight and crash landing in bahamian waters but they also 
are curious about two probes involving his gun collection and 
conduct as an attorney 
root was in stable condition today at memorial hospital in 
hollywood north of miami he was under heavy sedation friday 
its an odd story all right said roots brotherinlaw 
brett geer after visiting root at the hospital with this wound 
and him not being able to recollect how he got it im sure there is 
reason for an investigation 
root had a 32caliber handgun with him in the cockpit geer said 
investigators from the fbi and national transportation safety 
board need permission from roots physicians to conduct the 
interview 
there are many questions ill be asking said ntsb 
investigator andrew alston 
developments friday included 
in washington a us customs official said authorities found 35 
guns many of them loaded and a can of ether in a search of roots 
plane last april at the manassas airport in virginia 
all of the guns were legal under federal law and all but one 
under state law which led to a state misdemeanor charge the 
arsenal included assaultstyle rifles and three 357caliber magnum 
pistols root had told customs officials that the ether which can 
be used in cocaine production was used to clean his aircraft 
in north carolina secretary of state rufus edmisten said his 
office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a 
company with which root acted as an attorney edmisten said there 
are allegations that the company sonrise management services was 
set up in a way that allowed it to avoid securities laws edmisten 
said the lawyer knew he was under investigation 
root 36 apparently became unconscious in his cockpit friday 
with his plane on autopilot and military pilots shadowing his 
aircraft for nearly four hours 
his plane ran out of gas and crashed in miledeep waters 14 miles 
west of the bahamian island of eleuthera root swam to a raft where 
rescuers pulled him to safety 
geer said root told him the bullet wound was not selfinflicted 
and could have occurred when the impact of the crash triggered a 
32caliber pistol carried on board the singleengine cessna 
hollywood police chief richard witt noted that a powder burn on 
roots skin indicated the shot was fired at close range 
investigators said there was no evidence that anybody else was in 
the plane 
witt said surgeons had found a wound to roots abdomen and 
determined that a bullet passed through his colon exited struck 
him in the left arm and exited again 
authorities have received multiple phone calls from people in 
several states making various allegations that have not been 
confirmed said alston 
he declined to give details but said they came from private 
citizens and government agencies on topics that included roots 
finances and his piloting ability 
roots wife kathy 35 was in florida but has refused to comment 
on the episode alston said he hoped to interview roots relatives 
authorities earlier had speculated that the alexandria va 
communications lawyer may have had a heart attack or inhaled carbon 
monoxide causing him to black out about two hours after leaving 
washington national airport 
alston said root reported in radio transmissions that he was 
having difficulty breathing and then radio contact ceased 
capt james rahman the coast guard surgeon who first treated 
root in nassau bahamas said he was shocked to learn a gunshot 
wound had been discovered by doctors at memorial hospital 
rahman said root hestitated when asked to explain why he passed 
out 
looking back now i see that he answered everything else 
promptly i had to ask that question twice and he paused before 
answering but i didnt think about it at the time the doctor 
said

behind the cement walls barbedwire fences and 
guard towers of jneid prison 850 tough palestinian prisoners are 
running their own state 
the prison built on the barren hills near the west bank town of 
nablus is the largest for serious palestinian guerrillas those 
serving 20 years or more for attacks on israeli targets 
among the inmates dozens are serving life sentences israel 
television said 
the report friday by the state television the first time tv had 
been allowed to film inside the prison walls showed something that 
looked more like a miniature state than a jail 
the 850 inmates are kept in small often crowded cells each 
occupied by an average of 14 people jneid prison costs israel more 
than 75 million a year 
unlike other prisons there are reportedly no sexual assaults and 
no drugs in this one practically run by a committee of six elected 
leaders 
we have a committee of six prisoners who belong to different 
plo factions each group has its own internal laws of selecting its 
representatives said the prisoners spokesman abdel khader fares 
the committee was shown discussing prisoners demands with warden 
muffid abbas a druse officer and writing down a protocol of the 
talks 
the prisoners are trying to expand all the time what they see 
as miniautonomy they demand improvements in all the fields new 
teeth union rights free passage from one prison section to 
another and a private doctor the television said 
abbas said he usually responds positively to prisoners requests 
if it does not harm the security of the prison and if it is a 
human matter the prisoners need they know it and they appreciate 
it 
but fares serving a 15year sentence for planting a bomb and a 
firearm attack on an israeli bus had a different opinion 
he said inmates can pressure the authorities because of their 
influence on the palestinian revolt that has raged for 19 months 
outside jneid walls 
they feel we are a honorable part of the palestinian people in 
the occupied territories and we can influence the situation he 
said 
the prisoners refuse to work for the benefit of their israeli 
enemies but the discipline imposed by their leadership is tight and 
they clean their rooms run the kitchen and have a tailor and a 
barber 
the prison library has 4000 books and the prisoners use it to 
conduct lessons in hebrew english french philosophy and marxism 
the television said 
the prisoners also are allowed to spend 2 hours in the prison 
courtyards during one such break prisoners were shown purposefully 
playing table tennis basketball and chess or jogging around the 
courtyard 
the terrorists view the prison as an academy for revolutionary 
education and for the creation of commanders the television said 
every minute is reserved for useful conversations studies for 
strengthening the body and the spirit 
simon shoshan an officer of the prison administration said the 
prisoners have their own doctrine they have a specific way of 
life sport activities reading education they want to leave the 
prison more educated 
fares said the prisoners view their miniature jneid state as a 
step bringing the palestinians closer to their goal of independence 
we are inside prisons but everybody knows we are part of the 
palestinian people part of the palestine liberation organization 
he said 
during family visits held in a large hall separated by wire 
mesh the prisoners conversations are not monitored and it showed 
the inmates passing written notes described as instructions and 
reports the television said 
this is the heart of the prison a link to the territories 
the television said and if you ask the prisoners the uprising 
started here in security prisons

for an entry visa 
joseph voyame a swiss jurist named investigator for romania last 
march by the un human rights commission said romanias communist 
authorities told him friday that they consider the probe

the question of whether brig gen sla marshall 
fabricated data in his book about us soldiers under fire is 
central to a debate raging between his critics and his grandson 
in the renowned historians 1947 men against fire marshall 
stated that as few as 15 percent of american infantry soldiers in 
world war ii fired their weapons for a variety of factors including 
paralyzing fear 
the firing ratio finding led historians to change their 
emphasis in studying combat from the perspective of the commander to 
that of the common soldier and helped prompt the us military to 
modify infantry training for the korean and vietnam wars 
we think in a new way about combat because of marshall said 
fredric smoler a historian at sarah lawrence college in bronxville 
ny 
but smoler wrote in the march issue of american heritage magazine 
that marshalls findings were merely a theory he had derived from 
anecdotal evidence and not based on the authoritative study that 
marshall claimed 
marshalls thesis may have been based on evidence he made up 
smoler wrote 
marshalls grandson john marshall entered the fray late in may 
with a threepart series in the seattle postintelligencer that 
defended his ancestors thesis and questioned the research of his 
detractors 
marshall a reporter for the newspaper spent four weeks 
interviewing his grandfathers colleagues and searching archives 
the younger marshall fell out with his grandfather during the 
vietnam war when he was given an honorable discharge from the army 
as a conscientious objector in an interview last week he said he 
conducted the investigation of his grandfathers work as a 
reporter not a defender 
american heritage raised questions of methodology but they 
havent refuted his basic thesis the bigger issue is was he right 
or was he wrong john marshall said 
sla marshall who died in 1977 wrote 30 books over his career 
as a reporter for the detroit news and as military historian among 
his works are pork chop hill about the korean war battle and 
the american heritage history of world war i 
but his most important contribution was the firing ratio 
which he said was based on 400 to 600 postbattle interviews with 
us soldiers in europe in world war ii 
harold b leinbaugh a world war ii infantry company commander 
and author felt sla marshalls work maligned american soldiers 
and conducted the research that initially questioned the basis of 
marshalls hypothesis 
the research by leinbaugh and roger spiller a historian at the 
armys command and general staff college at fort leavenworth kan 
showed no statistical evidence existed to back up marshalls claim 
that most soldiers didnt fire in battle smoler wrote 
it all pivoted on the fact that marshall said he had the 
statistical evidence to back it up were saying he didnt have 
the numbers to back himself up said richard snow managing editor 
of american heritage 
spiller said he was doing research at the sla marshall 
military history collection at the university of texas in el paso 
for a possible biography of marshall and found no evidence of the 
studies marshall said he conducted 
i would have been satisfied with tickmarks on a page of rough 
notes but i did not find some indication that he had done what 
he said he had done spiller said in a telephone interview 
spiller also interviewed john g westover a retired western 
illinois university professor of history and marshalls assistant 
during his world war ii research who said he didnt recall 
conversations with marshall on the subject 
westover said marshall did not have the statistical evidence 
a social scientist would require to back the thesis 
the statistics are made up out of the whole cloth but the 
truth is there he said in a telephone interview 
spiller said he disagreed with john marshall and westover in 
accepting impressionistic evidence as the basis for the theory 
thats like saying it may not be the truth but it ought to 
be he said adding i use his books in class and will continue 
to do so but in a different way

foundation system said architect david davis one of its 
designers originally the cake was planned for 100 feet but that 
would have required a building permit

a political party that wants better relations with 
other planets and a wrestler who believes sports is the key to world 
peace have captured the fancy of voters wearied by the scandals of 
mainstream politicians 
half the seats in the upper house of parliament are at stake this 
month and the dominant political party is working overtime trying 
to clean up its image and raise its approval ratings by promising 
reforms 
meanwhile a variety of fringe parties are taking advantage of 
the disenchantment with the governing liberal democratic party and 
the law that liberally allocates the airwaves to political campaigns 
under the public office election law any party producing 10 
members who pay 29000 each as guarantee money can claim at 
least 14 minutes on the japan broadcasting corp channel and 
additional radio time reaching a potential audience of 122 million 
the ufo party offering nine candidates has qualified for four 
free television appearances and two radio broadcasts so has the 
sports peace party and the slashthenumberofparliamentarians 
party 
the miscellaneous peoples party which advocates gay rights 
earned two television appearances and one radio broadcast 
about 34 of the socalled miniparties are supporting candidates 
in the july 23 elections for 126 seats in the upper house 
although most candidates read their speeches on a staid

the fate of paramount communications incs 
hostile 122 billion bid for time inc rests with the delaware 
supreme court after a judge refused to block times 14 billion 
tender offer for warner communications inc 
the supreme court agreed late friday to hear the case after 
chancery court judge william t allen turned down a request by 
paramount and some of times biggest shareholders for an injunction 
against times bid for warner 
allen halted times 70 a share offer which had been scheduled 
to expire at midnight monday for 10 days to give paramount time to 
appeal his ruling if paramount loses it will pave the way for time 
and warner to merge forming time warner inc the worlds largest 
communications concern 
paramount which is offering 200 a share for time has said it 
would not pursue a buyout of time warner 
time called allens decision a very big step toward making 
time warner inc a reality 
allen rejected paramounts contention that time directors put the 
company up for sale by agreeing to a friendly merger with warner 
last march 
there has never been the slightest subjective interest in 
selling to or submerging time into another entity allen wrote in 
a 79page decision 
the judge agreed with times argument that the proposed merger 
with warner was the culmination of two years of negotiations and as 
such represented a longterm business decision 
allen said he concluded the plaintiffs hadnt shown a reasonable 
probability that they possessed the right to require times board to 
abandon or delay the warner transaction 
time is offering to pay 70 a share in cash for half of warners 
200 million outstanding shares and later exchange 70 in cash and 
securities for each of the remaining shares 
time stock fell 475 a share to 14525 a share on the new york 
stock exchange after having dipped as low as 138 a share 
warner stock rose 2 a share to 6425 and paramount slipped 12 
cents to 5750 a share 
allen heard arguments from both sides during a 5hour hearing 
tuesday 
attorneys for paramount and the shareholders who included texas 
investor robert m bass claimed times directors violated their 
duty by refusing to let shareholders vote on paramounts bid and the 
tender offer for warner 
the attorneys said the time and warner boards knew they were 
opening the companies up to outside bids by deciding to merge and 
time must therefore seriously consider paramounts offer 
allen agreed with the time and warner contention that times 
directors did not violate their duty to shareholders 
time and warner announced their original stockswap merger 
agreement march 4 the companies planned to submit the plan to 
shareholders but amended the agreement in june after paramount 
made its original 175 a share bid to provide for times 70 a 
share tender offer 
a vote was required on the original agreement because it involved 
the issuing of more time shares but an acquisition did not require 
a vote the lawyers argued 
times board has rejected paramounts bid as financially 
inadequate and too conditional to be viable time also has accused 
paramount of undertaking the bid solely to destroy the competitive 
advantage time warner would have over paramount 
allens decision and the final outcome of the case have been 
anxiously awaited by other companies that might be contemplating 
friendly mergers of their own 
many of the nations largest companies are incorporated in 
delaware like time paramount and warner and are subject to its 
laws 
allen disagreed with a claim by paramount and the shareholders 
that time had put itself up for sale in their initial merger 
agreement on the grounds the current warner shareholders would end 
up holding more than 60 percent of the stock in time warner

a family whose bean farm on the edge 
of the everglades was sold for nearly 23 million donated about a 
third of the cash to a high school scholarship fund 
i cant think of anything more important than getting the kids 
an education we just have to educate our kids properly said jack 
butler during a brief ceremony friday at which he presented the 64 
million endowment to deerfield beach high school 
the school was singled out to receive a third of the income from 
the sale of the land in the wills of butlers aunt and uncle james 
and alice butler pioneer farmers who came to south florida in 1910 
james butler died in 1965 mrs butler who died in 1976 
believed the sale of the 400acre farm would reap about 250000 
but rapid growth in south florida has inflated land prices in the 
area about 12 miles northwest of fort lauderdale american national 
development corp of coral springs acquired the property june 22 and 
plans to build home subdivisions 
we knew the property was worth a lot more than aunt alice 
thought said butler 72 who farmed the land until 1985 we 
just wanted to farm it pay the bills and keep it free and clear 
from debt until the time was right 
butler said the 1600student school also will receive a third of 
some other farm assets still to be sold 
school officials knew of the wills provisions for years but 
were stunned by the amount of the gift 
principal ronald clodfelter said many students who might not have 
considered college could now do so with grants from the fund he 
said the school will form a scholarship committee to oversee the 
funds and determine how they will be allocated 
under present rates the yearly interest from the endowment would 
be more than 500000 said david moyar a vice president at 
southeast bank which is handling the funds 
alice and james wanted to do a lot for the high school said 
george patterson an attorney for the butlers estate she was 
adamant about the school

the government accused communist north 
korea today of trying to stir unrest in south korea and called off 
talks on fielding a joint team at the 1990 asian games in china 
in a letter to north korea south korea canceled talks planned 
for tuesday at the border truce village of panmunjom 
the letter accused north korea of slander and hostile political 
maneuvering aimed at causing civil unrest in south korea but said 
south korea hoped talks would be resumed soon 
the cancellation reflected the souring relations between the 
countries over a series of illegal visits by south koreans to the 
north 
trips to north korea without prior government approval are a 
crime in south korea the government maintains that all contacts and 
dialogue with the north must be made through official channels 
the last sports meeting the second in a series was held in 
march but north korea had refused to resume the talks until 
recently 
the two koreas have tried to improve relations through a series 
of talks that began in 1988 although little progress has been made 
with each side insisting on its own initiatives 
contacts grew chillier earlier this year when north korea 
demanded that south korea cancel annual military exercises with the 
united states 
seoul since postponed other talks including those on a 
longplanned meeting between lawmakers from both nations and 
accused north korea of encouraging secret visits by south koreans to 
stir up problems in the south 
moon ikhwan a presbyterian minister who made an unauthorized 
visit to north korea in march to see north korean leader kim il 
sung has been jailed on charges of violating national security laws 
a student defied the seoul government and attended an 
international youth festival which ended last weekend in pyongyang 
triggering crackdowns on radical students in south korea 
an opposition lawmaker was arrrested june 28 for making a secret 
trip to north korea in august nine other people have been jailed 
for failing to report the lawmaker to authorities

the fbi said the four people charged this week with 
developing rockets for the irish republican army represent the 
groups main cogs in efforts to build sophisticated new weapons 
agents arrested three of the suspected ira technical experts 
wednesday and later seized radar and missile parts during raids in 
massachusetts new hampshire and pennsylvania the fbi said friday 
an arrest warrant was issued for a fourth who the fbi believes has 
gone into hiding in ireland 
investigators say the four were working for the provisional ira 
the guerrilla wing of the nationalist group fighting to end british 
rule in northern ireland 
the four face federal charges of conspiring to injure and destroy 
the property of a foreign government which carries a penalty of up 
to three years in prison and a 5000 fine 
among the items confiscated in raids wednesday and thursday on 
two apartments in bethlehem pa were 6footlong missile launching 
tubes and a videotape showing one of the suspects firing a rocket 
the fbi said 
a raid on a house in nashua nh yielded technical documents on 
missiles and british helicopters and a search of a house in 
harwich on cape cod turned up enough radar parts and electronic 
gear to fill a station wagon the fbi said 
it appears quite clear that they were doing a twofold 
operation building a radar deliverance system and developing 
rocket technology aimed at something and the something appears at 
the very least to be british helicopters said james f ahearn 
special agent in charge of the fbis boston office at a news 
conference friday 
ahearn said the ability to manufacture radarguided missiles 
would have added significant firepower to the iras campaign against 
the british 
arrested were richard clark johnson 41 of nashua nh martin 
peter quigley 27 a citizen of the republic of ireland who has been 
living since april in bethlehem pa and christina leigh reid 25 
of sunnyvale calif 
the fourth suspect was identified as irish citizen peter eamonn 
maguire 
we do believe that the main cogs in the wheel so to speak 
have been identified ahearn said 
wayne a budd us attorney for massachusetts said a grand jury 
is expected to consider other charges against the four including 
violations of the arms export control act and aiding a foreign 
insurrectionary group both of which carry prison sentences of up to 
10 years 
johnson and quigley were being held by the us marshals service 
in massachusetts and pennsylvania respectively 
johnson held a top secret security clearance as an electrical 
engineer for the mitre corp in bedford ahearn said there was no 
evidence that anything johnson did at mitre materially contributed 
to this case 
reid was released on 10000 bail thursday and a hearing was set 
for aug 8 to move her case to boston where budd said he expects 
all three defendants to go on trial 
ahearn said the arrests resulted from an investigation that began 
in 1981 and is continuing he said the fbi decided to arrest the 
defendants on short notice wednesday after they realized they were 
under surveillance 
he refused to say how they found out

jurors absolved a raw milk supplier from 
liability for nearly 100 million in unsettled claims from a 1985 
listeriosis outbreak in a decision that could limit compensation 
for some victims 
the jurors friday said that altadena certified dairy could not 
be held liable for a soft cheese produced with its milk the cheese 
made by jalisco mexican products inc was laden with the listeria 
bacteria 
the bacteria killed 48 people and caused birth defects and other 
ailments in dozens more 
i feel the lord has answered our prayers said altadena 
founder harold stueve 71 we had nothing to do with this case in 
the first place 
jalisco which has since gone out of business had claimed that 
altadena sold it tainted milk 
but altadenas lawyer raymond novell told the jury that 
bacteria was never found in the dairys milk or herds noting 
altadena supplied 26 million gallons of milk to 30 wholesale 
customers during the period in question and only jalisco had an 
outbreak of listeriosis 
this was strictly an issue between the two companies novell 
said after the 111 verdict jalisco looked around for deep 
pockets and sued us 
victims of the outbreak and their families wanted altadena to 
share responsibility 
jalisco had a small insurance policy to begin with about 10 
million almost threefourths of which has already been depleted in 
settlements of claims said attorney kim miller who represents 
claimants 
a lot of the significantly injured plaintiffs will have to take 
small compensations she said there will not be enough funds to 
properly compensate these victims from jalisco or its insurance 
proceeds

ideological education to shield young people from the influences of 
western culture official media reported today 
jiang at a meeting friday on higher education also attended by 
premier li peng said educators must take a clear stand against 
bourgeois liberalization in the wake of the studentled movement 
for democratic reform 
meanwhile staff at the jianguo hotel and several other 
wellknown beijing hotels said officials from the china national 
publications import and export corp a state company on friday 
removed all foreign magazines and newspapers from their stands 
several other hotels including the sheraton great wall the 
holiday inn and the palace also said foreign periodicals had been 
confiscated the hotels said the chinese officials gave no reason 
for confiscating the publications 
hotels are among the few places chinese have access to foreign 
news accounts of the crackdown on dissent in china which have 
differed greatly with the governments version satellite reception 
of tv news from the united states including cnn were cut off at 
several hotels earlier this month 
on friday the official press reported the government was 
planning a sweep on the nations bookstores to removal publications 
written by scholars wanted by police for participating in the 
prodemocracy movement 
the military crushed the movement in an attack on beijing on june 
34 after the government declared it had become a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion against the socialist system 
jiang the partys general secretary said the rebellion backed 
up statements by senior leader deng xiaoping that chinas most 
serious fault in recent years was neglecting ideological education 
quite a number of young people have been greatly influenced by 
western culture and ideology in recent years yet we have slackened 
correct ideological education among them as a result they are not 
mentally prepared to face the hardships and complexities in the 
socialist construction and the reform the official xinhua news 
agency quoted him as saying 
university students already have been told they will have 
additional mandatory classes in ideology this fall the beijing 
daily reported this week that summer vacation programs have been 
arranged for primary and middle school students to educate them in 
loving the communist party socialism the motherland and the 
peoples liberation army 
it said military officers will give lectures to children on the 
rebellion and children will visit martial law troops and the 
families of soldiers killed by protesters resisting their advance 
into the city 
jiang also gave backhanded praise to intellectuals who had 
expressed support for the democratic movement 
he said they were the gem of the nation but that 
intellectuals have their shortcomings and we should help them to 
have a better understanding through education and studies 
he said dissident fang lizhi who has sought refuge in the us 
embassy and is wanted for purported counterrevolutionary crimes 
and his like are scum of the chinese intellectuals and very few in 
number 
jiang was appointed party chief on june 24 when the party purged 
zhao ziyang who had sympathized with some of the students demands 
zhao stripped of all his party posts has not been seen since may 
19 
li ruihuan a member of the powerful politburo standing 
committee noted that chinas two latest bouts of bourgeois 
liberalization or flirtation with western culture began with 
student demonstrations the government also launched a campaign 
against bourgeois liberalization after student demonstrations in the 
winter of 198687 
this fact poses a problem for us and we should make a thorough 
study on how to run the schools well he said 
also friday the us senate voted 8110 to impose economic 
sanctions on china and to urge president bush to take even harsher 
measures 
the legislation passed as an amendment to a pending state 
department appropriations bill adopts several sanctions passed 
earlier by the house it requires bush to suspend several trade 
programs but gives him the flexibility to stop any program 
suspension 
the legislation includes sixmonth suspensions of trade insurance 
by the overseas private investment corp and the use of us funds 
to support china trade 
the senate also adopted nonbinding suggestions in which they 
urged bush to take stiffer steps including reviewing all trade 
agreements between the countries 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in paris with bush for a 
summit of the seven leading industrial nations said the 
administration would consider the legislation but that the 
presidents current response to the crackdown has been appropriate

spreading strikes in the kuzbass coal region of 
siberia are causing heavy economic losses newspapers reported today 
as officials appealed to miners in at least nine cities to return to 
work 
settlements were reported with miners in two cities 
mezhdurechinsk and osiniki but strikes elsewhere have spread the 
reports said 
soviet newspapers described a chaotic situation in the kuzbass 
an important coalproducing region about 1600 miles east of moscow 
it supplies fuel to the metallurgical industries in the ural 
mountains to the west 
thousands of miners and their families were said to be meeting in 
town squares throughout the coalproducing basin to protest harsh 
living and working conditions 
authorities reported an end to the strike thursday but miners 
expanded their demands from economic issues such as food housing 
and health care to broader demands for political change soviet 
reports said 
the crisis was sharpest in the town of prokopevsk where 
production was virtually halted the communist party newspaper 
sotsialisticheskaya industriya reported in a dispatch from kemerov 
oblast in the kuzbass 
events in the kuzbass have taken a sharp turn the newspaper 
reported although miners returned to work in mezhdurechensk in 
other mining towns in the basin the situation has sharply 
intensified 
mining minister mikhail i shchadov was in the area rushing from 
mine to mine spending many hours speaking to the strikers and 
trying to end the stoppage the newspaper said 
in addition to the agreement reached in mezhdurechensk where the 
strike began tuesday authorities also reached a settlement with 
miners in osiniki according to sotsialisticheskaya industriya and 
pravda another party newspaper 
strikes continued at prokopevsk at kisilevsk five out of 10 
mines were on strike two mines were on strike at leninkuznets in 
kemerov the administrative center of the region the severnaya and 
butovkskaya mines were on strike miners were striking in 
novokuznetsk according to the newspaper reports 
miners in byelov and anzherosudzhesk continued to work but 
still made demands on authorities the reports said reports said 
miners in nine cities were striking although the published lists 
did not match 
the reports said that despite a rather chaotic situation rife 
with rumors miners strike committees that formed friday were 
keeping social order 
at their demand sales of liquor were stopped and narcotics 
control points were established along highways pravda reported in 
a dispatch from its correspondent at the scene 
it said that on thursday in novokuznetsk and on friday in 
kemerov efforts were made by the socalled democratic union and 
several other informal organizations to spread antisoviet slogans 
but they received a resolute rebuff 
authorities throughout the region tried to talk the miners back 
to work 
democracy means not only rights but also responsbility 
discipline and organization sotsialisticheskaya industriya warned 
strikes were once hushed up and brutally suppressed in the soviet 
union where they were considered a western phenomenon resulting 
from capitalist exploitation this year however coal strikes have 
generally ended after several days with government concessions 
last march more than 100 coal miners in the ural city of vorkuta 
struck to protest increased work orders in april miners stayed 
underground in the siberian city of norilsk to demand a 30 percent 
wage increase 
twentyfour miners are reported to be staying underground in 
alexandria in the ukraine with demands similar to their kuzbass 
counterparts

the commodities futures trading commission says it 
will review the trading positions of chicago board of trade 
directors to see if any of them profited from the drop in soybean 
prices precipitated by their emergency order earlier this week 
the cftc made the announcement friday as italian agribusiness 
giant ferruzzi said it would renew its court battle to recover 
losses from a board of trade order forcing soybean traders to 
liquidate large positions in the market 
raul gardini chairman of ferruzzi finanzaria spa reiterated in 
milan that his companys accumulation of futures contracts to take 
delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans was legal 
a feruzzi spokesman said a lawsuit probably would be filed in 
chicago but did not provide a timetable the company also indicated 
it might seek compensation for unrealized profits as well as damage 
to its reputation 
on thursday us district judge james zaghel denied a request by 
two of the companys subsidiaries ferruzzi trading international 
sa and ferruzzi usa inc for a restraining order and a permanent 
injunction ending the directive issued tuesday by the cbot 
zagel told cbot attorneys to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
by tuesday with a response due july 24 
gardini didnt specify the amount of losses ferruzzi suffered as 
a result of the boards order which required all traders to reduce 
their july contract soybean holdings to 1 million bushels by the 
close of trading thursday 
cbot directors have said they issued the liquidation order 
because the open july soybean contracts totaled about 40 million 
bushels and there were abnormally low levels of stocks available to 
satisfy the contracts a situation that would have resulted in a 
number of defaults without the exchanges intervention 
any player with a large enough share of the market a position 
referred to as cornering the market theoretically could force 
those on the other end of its futures contracts to deliver possibly 
causing a scramble for supplies that would drive the price of its 
soybeans up sharply 
soybean prices for july delivery rose 6 cents to 703 a bushel 
on friday despite the gain the price was still well below 726 a 
bushel the level at which july soybeans settled on tuesday before 
the board of trades directive 
ferruzzi and all major world traders are convinced that the 
board made a mistake and has to suffer the consequences gardini 
said about the potential lawsuit 
ferruzzi has said it accumulated large soybean supplies to keep 
its processing plants running and to meet export commitments and 
also that its large futures market position was a hedge against 
price fluctuations 
in washington the cftc said it would review the trading 
positions of exchange directors and the minutes of the meeting at 
which the decision was made to force liquidation of soybean 
contracts 
board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann has said that none of 
those involved in the decision held a position in the soybean market 
when they voted to issue the emergency order 
meanwhile sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee expressed concern over the actions taken by 
the board of trade 
there have been serious allegations that there may have been an 
effort to manipulate the soybean futures market he said i will 
insist on a full and rigorous investigation of any wrongdoing and 
that the perpetrators be punished to full extent of the law 
if reforms are necessary to prevent these types of

seven years after his sisters body was found 
along the green river one of the first victims in the nations 
worst serial murder case garrett mills says he can only hope police 
have the killer 
police began sorting through the 1800 videotapes and 55 cartons 
and bags of materials seized from william jay stevens ii a former 
law student named in court papers as a viable suspect in the 
slayings the sorting could take a month 
stevens has not been charged in the case and he denies any 
involvement his name became public late this week in an affidavit 
supporting a search warrant for two spokane homes used by him 
the affidavit said he was under investigation in the case and 
might be linked to at least 17 other homicide victims whose bodies 
were found along highways between portland and vancouver british 
columbia and between seattle and spokane 
mills sister 16yearold opal charmaine mills was one of the 40 
known green river victims police have blamed the killer for the 
disappearance of eight other young women 
ranging in age from 15 to 36 the female victims vanished between 
july 1982 and early 1984 of the 40 corpses 36 were found in the 
seattle area and four near portland ore four remain unidentified 
the case takes its name from the site south of seattle where the 
first five corpses were found in the summer of 1982 
i paid attention a lot at first but i got tired of getting my 
hopes up mills 25 said friday of the investigation 
he added i hope its him but i dont know 
stevens is serving a oneyear term in the county jail in seattle 
for the burglary of a police equipment supply store in 1979 and 
additional time for walking away from a workrelease center in 1981 
he was rearrested in spokane on jan 10 
stevens was found after manhunt a nationally syndicated 
television show aired a program in december about the green river 
killings one tipster directed investigators to gonzaga university 
law school in spokane where stevens had attended classes for 3 
years and was president of the student bar 
whether or not this person is simply the victim of a bizarre 
set of circumstances or in fact responsible for some of the crimes 
in king county we dont know yet and thats exactly what were 
trying to determine by going through the material we recovered with 
the warrant green river task force commander robert c evans said 
friday 
stevens who declined jailhouse interviews is concerned hes 
being singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation said 
his attorney craig beles 
he feels basically like anybody who is innocent of the offenses 
being looked at by the green river task force he is angry and 
frightened said beles hes a colorful character but hes no 
murderer 
no personal items belonging to any green river victims were found 
in wednesdays searches evans said 
evans acknowledged the king county police task force had found 
no smoking gun but he said an initial study of 405 documents 
charting stevens movements between 1981 and 1989 showed they 
sometimes closely paralleled the killings 
records seized when he was arrested show he traveled extensively 
between seattle portland spokane and vancouver british columbia 
under at least four aliases during the period evans said 
after his arrest spokane authorities found in searches that 
stevens possessed several policetype vehicles 26 license plates 
29 firearms and about 100 police badges investigators said 
the task force has long suspected the killer could be a police 
officer or someone posing as one evans said 
in the affidavit many who knew stevens said he liked 
pornography frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of 
mutilated women

gov michael s dukakis took more heat for his 1990 
budget cuts which critics say could have been avoided had he acted 
swiftly to limit the states financial troubles a year ago during 
his presidential campaign 
demonstrators on friday poured inside the statehouse and marched 
to the doors of the governors office chanting no more cuts 
dukakis was not in and they left peacefully about 20 minutes later 
lets send a message throughout the commonwealth of 
massachusetts boston mayor raymond flynn said at the 
demonstration we are going to restore some semblance of decency 
and respect and compassion for people who need our help 
meanwhile lawmakers vowed to restore 100 million in state aid 
to cities and towns that the governor vetoed to balance the fiscal 
1990 budget 
dukakis returned to the statehouse later friday to face other bad 
news standard amp poors dropped massachusetts bond rating for the 
second time this year the agency cited financial disarray in 
massachusetts government the move will add millions to borrowing 
costs 
its not unexpected had we demonstrated fiscal strength 
we wouldnt have had to do what we did yesterday dukakis said of 
the budget cuts 
dukakis defended his 1990 budget cuts as an essential part of 
getting the state back on track 
the governor has come under fire for not acting swiftly when the 
state began to run into financial trouble a year ago 
theyve been whistling while rome burned in this 
administration said rep john flood a democrat who chairs the 
house of representatives taxation committee 
this is not a surprise to a lot of people flood said it 
was avoidable and the administration chose to ignore the warnings 
dukakis aides also announced the governor was postponing signing 
a bill legislators passed early friday that would impose an income 
tax surcharge to make up the 1989 budget deficit and pay outstanding 
medicaid debts the measure is projected to raise 744 million over 
18 months 
he plans to sign it assuming all the legal and technical 
questions are answered said aide mindy lubber 
citizens for limited taxation and other antitax advocates say 
theyll take the income tax issue to the 1990 ballot to seek a 
refund

rival shiite moslem militias clashed in 
the slums of south beirut today and syrian and christian forces 
fought artillery battles across the capital amid a power blackout 
caused by fuel shortages 
police said one person was killed and four were wounded in the 
fourhour clash between the mainstream shiite amal militia which is 
backed by syria and the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
the two factions have clashed intermittently since april 1988 as 
they vied for dominance of 12 million shiites the largest single 
sect in lebanon 
by police count the new casualties brought the overall toll of 
the power struggle to 561 killed and 1554 wounded 
syrian troops deployed in west beirut sent patrols at 4 am into 
the lowincome suburbs to disengage the militiamen and enforce a 
ceasefire between the secular amal and the fundamentalist 
hezbollah a police spokesman said 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations said 
syrian gunners in west beirut sporadically shelled the coast from 
east beirut to the port of byblos 28 miles to the north 
maintaining their sea blockade of the christian heartland 
he said artillery fire fell around byblos and jounieh another 
port about 12 miles north of beirut no casualties were reported 
christian gunners of army commander gen michel aoun fired back 
with 155mm guns targeting positions along west beiruts seaside 
districts 
the police spokesman said at least one round exploded within a 
few yards of a syrian artillery emplacement in a deserted soccer 
field in the fashionable manara district 
we dont know if the syrians suffered any casualties they 
usually evacuate their casualties to their own field hospitals and 
clinics which are not under our jurisdiction the police spokesman 
said 
syrias army command does not comment on losses among its 40000 
soldiers stationed in lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate 
the blockade of the christian enclave has caused fuel oil 
shortages at beiruts main power generating plant in suburban zouk 
the sea blockade has prevented shipments from arriving from abroad 
and checkpoints around the enclave obstructed supplies from 
refineries in south and north lebanon 
the electricity authority announced that as of today its 
generators will supply only the main water pumping station in beirut 
and major hospitals and telecommunication switchboards with two 
hours of power every 24 hours on rotating basis 
the public in both sectors of the divided capital and in the 
christian heartland to the north will receive none 
it was the second time that the city has plunged into total 
darkness since the confrontation between aoun and the syrians began 
march 8 last months crisis was resolved after a partial lift of 
the land siege

the bicentennial bash in honor of the french 
revolution peaked with a parade that featured moonwalking americans 
scottish bagpipers soviet tanks spewing confetti and a touching 
reminder of the crackdown in china 
the three days of bicentennial celebrations were to close tonight 
at the eiffel tower with what was billed as the biggest ever 
fireworks display 
the most offbeat event was the parade friday night that featured 
a moonwalking florida aampm university marching band british 
firefighters spraying spectators with water and a russian bear 
skating pirouttes on ice 
perhaps the most poignant moment came early in the parade as 
hundreds of chinese students from paris hong kong and the united 
states rode bicycles and flashed peace signs from the arc de 
triomphe to the place de la concorde 
they wore headbands bearing the chinese characters signifying 
liberty equality fraternity some wore masks so they could not 
be identified a reflection of the fear that many chinese feel after 
the june 34 crackdown on the prodemocracy protesters 
i came to see an unusual parade and i got exactly what i 
wanted said claude bernes an insurance salesman it was 
fabulous but the only sketch that had any connection to the 
revolution and its ideals was the chinese 
the 250 musicians from florida aampm dazzled onlookers estimated 
at 1 million as they boogied and tooted in an allout salute to 
soul singer james brown 
the band was flanked by two giant floats topped by dancing 
pompom girls and flagwaving americans 
some brandished messages to the folks back home mom please 
pay my visa bill read one keep abortion legal said another 
more than 30 heads of state or government seven of them 
attending the summit of the worlds main industrialized democracies 
were participating in bicentennial events 
in the space of a few days france has received on its 
territory threequarters of the worlds gross national product and 
nearly 100 percent of the planets military arsenal wrote the 
conservative le figaro in todays editions 
the muchanticipated parade entitled the marseillaise and 
starring more than 10000 musicians turned the famed champselysees 
into an enchanted stage for more than three hours 
scottish bagpipers marching in the rain shared the limelight with 
british ponies painted to resemble zebras a human pyramid formed by 
undulating senegalese dancers in native costume and soviet tanks 
spewing confettisnow as they recreated the siberian winter 
the 15 million parade was billed as a a slightly frivolous 
operaballet by its creator advertising man jeanpaul goude 
better known for his work with grace jones and at esquire magazine 
halfway through the program the crowd drew its collective breath 
as american diva jessye norman emerged from behind a curtain of rain 
regally draped in a flowing tricolor gown to sing the rousing 
verses of the marseillaise 
many people were offended because our national anthem was sung 
by a foreigner but i think its only fitting to have the best voice 
in the world said bernard houri a computer engineer 
besides the lively and sometimes impatient crowd lining the 
champselysees perched on trees and in building windows the parade 
was broadcast to millions of viewers in france europe and the 
united states 
french president francois mitterrand joined by about 30 heads of 
state watched from behind a bulletproof glass viewing booth 
overlooking the place de la concorde ringed with bleachers seating 
16000 invited guests 
the most extraordinary image tonight was the ocean of people 
who streamed down the champselysees said jeanmichel jeanneney 
president of the bicentennial mission 
for many however being there was not enough 
it was a great show but it should have been for everybody 
said terry golden of london we waited for hours and just barely 
got a glimpse of the top of heads and floats the parade was for the 
rich not for the masses which really isnt in keeping with the 
revolution is it

leaders of the worlds seven richest nations today 
pledged to sustain the momentum of moves toward democracy in 
poland and hungary and jointly warned china that it risks 
international isolation by continued repression 
despite the words of encouragement for poland and hungary the 
leaders declaration showed no evidence of immediate aid to match 
the the 125 million package of incentives president bush extended 
to the two communist bloc nations earlier this week 
nor were there any joint sanctions against china 
a declaration on political issues was issued at the midpoint of a 
sevennation summit of the united states britain france west 
germany italy canada and japan 
at the urging of west german chancellor helmut kohl the document 
was amended by the leaders to emphasize the urgent need for food 
assistance for poland where shortages are rampant 
the document called for a meeting of all interested countries 
within the next few weeks to discuss ways to reward reforms in both 
poland and hungary 
bush played down the absence of specific aid commitments 
although the seven leaders promised to consider and coordinate 
economic assistance aimed at transforming and opening the 
economies of the two soviet bloc countries 
bush said there have been some misconceptions that we would 
come in here with a dollar package i managed to convey in poland 
that that was not the case and here it is not the case 
he said the communique vindicated his approach 
british prime minister margaret thatcher speaking of the seven 
summit nations said we are all very anxious to help we are all 
helping each in our own way 
the leaders reaffirmed their support for easing polands 39 
billion foreign debt burden by relaxing its payment schedule white 
house chief of staff john sununu said this could provide poland with 
5 billion in relief 
the communique also urged the international monetary fund to 
speed up consideration of new loans for poland 
we welcome the process of reform under way in poland and 
hungary the statement said we recognize that the political 
changes taking place in these countries will be difficult to sustain 
without economic progress 
bush said there seems to be a marvelous unanimity of opinion 
of how to treat these east european countries 
britain last month announced a 25 million aid package to poland 
the money is to be spread over five years for a knowhow fund on 
training poles to operate an entrepreneurial economy 
moving beyond political issues the leaders met today to discuss 
economic problems and economic issues in a windowless room atop the 
grand arch a 35story avantgarde cubic structure of glass and 
marble that is frances newest national symbol and subject of 
architectural controversy 
on china the political communique urged the world bank to 
withhold new loans and called on beijing to cease action against 
those who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to 
democracy and liberty 
the seven nations the united states france britain west 
germany italy canada and japan all promised to shelter chinese 
students who did not want to go home 
the leaders called on chinese authorities to create conditions 
which will avoid their isolation and to resume earlier moves 
toward political and economic reforms in the worlds largest nation 
on the soviet union the seven democracies registered their 
approval of easing eastwest tensions but said moscow remains a 
threat to each of us with its continuing military balance favoring 
the east 
the political statement also issued a fresh condemnation of 
terrorism and vowed to bring terrorists to justice 
we call on those holding hostages to release them immediately 
and unconditionally and on those with influence over hostagetakers 
to use it to this end the document said there are 15 foreign 
hostages in lebanon including citizens of three summit countries 
the united states britain and italy 
the summit statement did not single out any country as a sponsor 
of terrorism 
the leaders underscored their support for international measures 
to protect against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 that killed 270 people in 
lockerbie scotland last december 
we have agreed to give priority to preventing such attacks by 
further strengthening security measures the statement said we 
have also agreed on the need for improved methods of detecting 
explosives 
the meeting of the worlds wealthiest industrial democracies 
largest seven came amid a huge celebration of the 200th birthday of 
the french revolution a multimillion dollar gala that has been 
criticized in the press here as overly extravagant and expensive 
bush today offered high praise for the festivities saying the 
pageant of parades fireworks and parties was just magnificent 
beautifully done very special to all americans 
in the political declaration the leaders said they were prepared 
to support reforms in poland and hungary and to consider in an 
appropriate fashion economic assistance aimed at transforming and 
opening their economies in a durable manner 
the big seven countries said the aid should be designed to 
sustain the momentum of the reforms through inward investment joint 
ventures transfer of managerial skills professional training and 
other ventures which would help develop a more competitive economy 
after opening their talks friday evening the leaders joined in a 
joyous celebration of bastille day the beginning of the french 
revolution 
the festivities began with a lavish dinner of lamb and sea perch 
the leaders then stepped onto a balcony enclosed with bulletproof 
glass to watch a 15 million parade featuring among other 
attractions the 250 musicians of the florida aampm band gliding 
backwards in a michael jackson moonwalk down the champs elysees 
before a crowd estimated at 1 million 
the evening concluded with a fireworks spectacular of red white 
and blue rocket plumes the french colors 
while the leaders were smiling in public there were sharp 
differences in private sessions over french president francois 
mitterrands attempts to arrange a meeting of wealthy and poor 
nations to discuss the problems of third world countries 
the united states and britain firmly resisted mitterrands 
proposal 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said the best approach to third 
world problems was on a casebycase basis rather than convening an 
international conference 
you dont get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and 
calling them north and south as the rich and poor nations are 
often called brady said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl took a middleroad approach 
he said he had heard the complaints of poor nations and the demands 
for the big seven summit countries to open their markets to third 
world products 
there also was an argument in the wings between britain and 
france as the two sides playing out old rivalries sniped at each 
other about everything from the significance of the french 
revolution to mrs thatchers rightwing politics 
in addition to urging consideration of poor nations demands 
mitterrand emphasized the need to combat illegal drugs saying he 
was shocked by the effect the narcotics epidemic is having on 
youths according to french spokesman hubert vedrine 
kohl urged his summit partners to adopt policies that would allow 
continued economic growth while reducing trade surpluses 
even before the summit opened the united states and japan moved 
to cool trade tensions which flared up this year after the 
administration adopted a tough line targeting japan as an unfair 
trader because of barriers to the sale of american goods in japan 
japan originally reacted with outrage at being singled out but 
both sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude friday after a 
private meeting between bush and japanese prime minister sousuke uno 
the japanese reversing course agreed to launch negotiations 
aimed at removing barriers to sales of foreign goods 
bush was less successful however at breaking a deadlock between 
negotiators trying to produce a debtreduction plan for mexico 
us officials announced later that the administration would be 
willing to extend an emergency loan of between 1 billion and 2 
billion to mexico if the money would help break a deadlock in 
current negotiations between mexico and the commercial banks that 
hold the bulk of its debt

1 we the leaders of our seven countries and the representatives 
of the european community reaffirm the universal and supreme 
importance which we attach to freedom democracy and the promotion 
of human rights 
2 we see signs of this same desire for greater freedom and 
democracy in the east the people there including the young people 
are reasserting these values and calling for a pluralist democratic 
society some of their leaders are aware of the positive 
contribution that greater freedom and democracy can make to the 
modernization of their countries and are starting to make changes to 
their laws practices and institutions others are still endeavoring 
to resist this movement by taking repressive measures which we 
strongly condemn 
3 we hope that freedom will be broadened and democracy 
strengthened and that they will form the basis after decades of 
military confrontation ideological antagonism and mistrust for 
increased dialogue and cooperation we welcome the reforms under way 
and the prospects of lessening the division of europe 
4 we call upon the soviet government to translate its new 
policies and pronouncements into further concrete action at home and 
abroad military imbalances favoring the soviet union both in 
europe and in asia remain an objective threat to each of us our 
governments must therefore continue to be vigilant and maintain the 
strength of our countries for the foreseeable future there is no 
alternative for each of us within existing alliances to 
maintaining a strategy of deterrence based upon an appropriate mix 
of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces in order 
to hasten the advent of a world in which the weight of arms and 
military strength is reduced we recommit ourselves to the urgent 
pursuit of a global ban on chemical weapons a conventional forces 
balance in europe at the lowest possible level consistent with our 
security requirements and a substantial reduction in soviet and 
american strategic nuclear arms

balanced economic cooperation on a sound commercial basis consistent 
with the security interests of each of our countries and with the 
general principles of international trade we have noted 
developments of relations between the eec and countries of the east 
in particular the conclusion of an agreement with hungary the 
progress already achieved during the current discussions with poland 
and the opening of negotiations with the soviet union

hungary we recognize that the political changes taking place in 
these countries will be difficult to sustain without economic 
progress each of us is prepared to support this process and to 
consider as appropriate and in a coordinated fashion economic 
assistance aimed at transforming and opening their economies in a 
durable manner we believe that each of us should direct our 
assistance to these countries so as to sustain the momentum of 
reform through inward investment joint ventures transfer of 
managerial skills professional training and other ventures which 
would help develop a more competitive economy

encourage economic reforms to promote more competitive economies and

multilateral institutions to concert support for the process of 
reform under way in hungary and poland in order to make our 
measures of support more effective and mutually reinforcing we will 
encourage further creative efforts by interested governments the 
public and the private sectors in support of the reform process 
concerning concerted support for reform in poland and hungary we 
call for a meeting with all interested countries which will take 
place in the next few weeks we underline for poland the urgent 
need for food in present circumstances 
to these ends we ask the commission of the european communities 
to take the necessary initiatives in agreement with the other member 
states of the community and to associate besides the summit 
participants all interested countries 
7 we are in favor of an early conclusion of the negotiations 
between the imf and poland the strengthened debt strategy is 
applicable to poland provided it meets the conditions we are ready 
to support in the paris club the rescheduling of polish debt 
expeditiously and in a flexible and forthcoming manner 
8 we see good opportunities for the countries of west and east 
to work together to find just solutions to conflicts around the 
world to fight against underdevelopment to safeguard the 
resources and the environment and to build a freer and more open 
world

the bush administration today raised the possibility 
of a breakthrough within the next 24 hours or so in the drawnout 
debt negotiations between mexico and its private bankers 
it is in the dotting the i and crossing the t stage on some 
of the tough details that are important both of mexico and the 
banks white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters at 
the economic summit of the seven major industrialized nations 
the white house would like to have a deal to show to its partners 
at the summit 
the negotiations have become a test case of the administrations 
new strategy for dealing with the 13 trillion debt of the 
developing nations the new approach representing a major shift in 
american policy emphasizes debt reduction or forgiveness 
sununu showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching said 
mexican officials and private bankers are now about that far 
apart he said there was expected to be another bargaining session 
in the next 24 hours or so and it is hoped that at that meeting 
substantially most of if not all of that gap will be closed 
meanwhile president bush and the leaders of britain canada 
france germany italy and japan opened their first full day of 
talks today with an agreement to postpone new world bank loans to 
china 
the leaders noted in a statement that they already had condemned 
the violent repression we urge the chinese authorities to 
cease action against those who have done no more than claim their 
legitimate rights to democracy and liberty 
during the morning session the leaders and their finance 
ministers discussed the worrisome rise in inflation rates 
they all recognize that inflation is a danger even though some 
are more seriously affected at the moment said a canadian 
official demanding anonymity 
inflation has to be considered as a matter of very high 
priority he added 
a spokesman for the european economic community who demanded 
anonymity said senior officials of some private banks met here 
friday afternoon with some of the indebted nations including mexico 
and the philippines 
they are very close to an agreement with mexico but not before 
the end of the summit he said the 12nation trading bloc also 
known as the common market also attends the gathering 
the eec spokesman said the problem was that until about 10 
days ago the banks were sending extremely junior officials to 
negotiate with very senior officials sometimes ministers of 
finance from the indebted countries 
sununu asked about the elevation of the discussions said it 
is amazing what can happen when you get the folks who can make the 
decisions involved in the process 
on friday french president francois mitterrand pressed the 
demand of poorer nations for a special conference of the rich and 
poor countries to discuss the plight of the third world 
but the united states and britain resisted that approach 
treasury secretary nicholas brady insisted that handling third 
world problems on a casebycase basis the approach the richer 
nations currently take is better than an international conference 
brady unveiled the new american debt approach last spring 
several other nations have approved the move but some us allies 
also expressed reservations about what they viewed as government 
bailouts 
nigel lawson britains chancellor of the exchequer said what 
is important is we have agreed on this extension of the debt 
strategy referring to the american plan 
and the commercial banks need to be absolutely clear there is 
no new initiative coming forward he said that is the position 
and it is up to them to negotiate a debt reduction agreement with 
the debtor countries starting with mexico 
brady said the united states was willing to work with the other 
industrialized nations to arrange a 1 billion to 2 billion 
emergency loan to help mexico meet its obligations while it 
negotiates with private bankers for a new debt accord 
mexico with a loan portfolio of 100 billion is the developing 
worlds second largest debtor after brazil 
mitterrand signaled his support for urgent assistance for mexico 
that country he told french television is on the edge of an 
explosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility of 
carrying the burden 
no one he said has an interest in this explosion taking 
place which would mean more misery for a suffering people 
mexico owes private lenders 54 billion with about 15 billion 
due american banks 
in its negotiations with bankers mexico wants to slash both its 
overall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments which 
run about 10 billion a year 
the united states and japan also took steps as the summit opened 
to lower trade tensions between the two countries 
the japanese agreed to a us proposal to launch negotiations 
aimed at removing barriers to the sale of foreign goods the talks 
will focus on socalled structural rigidities broadbased barriers 
such as the japanese distribution system 
the japanese who had originally balked at the idea of such 
talks agreed to a oneyear deadline to come up with results

outside the closed meeting rooms of the house 
appropriations committee last week the view was the same clusters 
of men and women leaning against walls talking reading newspapers 
killing time 
it was a vigil of lobbyists waiting for members of the 
appropriations subcommittees to strike their deals and map in 
private how the government would spend more than half of the 117 
trillion federal budget for the 1990 fiscal year 
for many of the lobbyists the wait was grim after years of 
federal budget constraints advocates for programs that could once 
count on generous government treatment are finding uncle sam 
stingier than he used to be and theyre competing with each other 
for the same scarce federal dollars 
the first clue is that attendance here is 10 percent of what it 
usually is said david bradley motioning down the rayburn house 
office building corridor as he and other lobbyists waited outside a 
meeting of the appropriations labor health and human services 
subcommittee thats because theres no money 
bradley lobbying for lowincome programs was exaggerating but 
only slightly 
the labor subcommittee has jurisdiction over the governments 
health welfare and education programs a 155 billion slice of the 
federal pie for the coming fiscal year which begins oct 1 
but law requires that about twothirds of that be spent on 
specific programs the rest of it is up for grabs and small 
programs with limited appeal to lawmakers are finding themselves 
competing for funds with politically popular initiatives for 
education aids research the homeless and the like 
this strikes fear in the hearts of lobbyists for the governments 
less visible programs 
poverty isnt popular said bradley what were seeing is 
an understated but very definite realignment of government 
priorities were seeing interest flow in three or four areas and 
an ending of the government role in other areas 
outside another closed door this one in the capitol basement 
another group of lobbyists waited as the appropriations treasury and 
postal service subcommittee wrote its 185 billion bill 
some of them were working on behalf of postal subsidies for small 
newspapers charities unions and schools which are entitled to 
lower mailing rates the reagan administration had tried to 
terminate the 430 million program and president bush has proposed 
limiting it 
advocates were hoping to win a slight increase for the subsidies 
but they acknowledged they faced formidable competition for federal 
funds from another area within the subcommittees jurisdiction 
the big issue in this committee is drug enforcement said 
carolyn emigh counsel for the nonprofit mailers association 
antidrug programs are among the most popular programs on capitol 
hill these days as lawmakers heed polls indicating that drugs are 
the foremost problem on the minds of voters their appeal makes it 
easy for members of congress to lavish them with money 
right now drugs are pretty high on the list sen robert 
byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
acknowledged in an interview 
congressional spending priorities are easy to discern by studying 
the way the senate appropriations committee divided up the 658 
billion it oversees among its 13 subcommittees 
the three largest increases over 1989 spending levels were of 
53 billion to the subcommittee that oversees veterans housing 
science and space programs 4 billion to the panel that controls 
health and education and 18 billion to the subcommittee with 
jurisdiction over law enforcement 
that still left byrd fielding complaints at a committee meeting 
last week that several subcommittees had been granted too little 
money 
the tight money seems not to have stopped lawmakers themselves 
from seeking funds for projects within their home districts however 
byrd said the appropriations interior subcommittee which he also 
chairs has so far received 1971 requests for money for projects 
and sen tom harkin diowa chairman of the appropriations labor 
health and human services panel said he had gotten 455 requests

mexico badly needs the help president bush is 
offering to reduce payments on its foreign debt but even with 
substantial relief coaxing the country out of seven years of 
stagnation may be a slow process 
mexican as well as foreign investors are waiting for the 
starting flag that the solution to the debt negotiations will 
give said president carlos salinas de gortari who met with bush 
last week 
attention was focused last week on talks between mexico and 
creditor banks as world leaders gathered in paris for an economic 
summit bush wanted an agreement as a showpiece for its strategy to 
reduce the third worlds 13 trillion debt 
the lengthy negotiations apparently snagged and bush tried to 
give them a boost by offering mexico a temporary loan of 1 billion 
to 2 billion the offer appeared to be aimed at showing banks and 
other creditor nations the united states would put its money where 
its mouth is 
for mexico an agreement would mean both money and a 
psychological boost two elements needed to reignite growth mexico 
owes 1074 billion and maintains that its economy is hobbled 
because it must spend 16 billion every year to pay the interest and 
principal 
mexico wants to reduce those payments by 7 billion money that 
could then be invested in industrial expansion to provide jobs 
mexico has one million young people entering the job market every 
year creating tremendous social pressure some of which is 
relieved by emigration to the united states 
what can happen when a social system is under stress was seen 
earlier this year when rioting broke out in caracas venezuela and 
food stores were looted in argentina 
one private economist compared mexico to a family whose loan 
payments leave little left over even for basics like rent food or 
transportation the family cuts spending and tries to increase its 
income to avoid taking on more loans but all its money goes into 
the loan payments and it remains poor 
mexico incurred most of its debt between 1976 and 1982 when 
eager banks pressed money on a nation that thought oil had made it 
rich but the price of oil crashed and growth in mexico for the past 
six years has averaged about zero the buying power of the average 
paycheck has been cut in half 
when we talk about growth it means to stop the fall in buying 
power to stop the process of impoverishment of mexican society 
said jacobo zaidenweber a textile manufacturer who is president of 
the usmexico chamber of commerce 
to turn the situation around requires investment thats where 
foreign debt reduction comes in 
if a satisfactory agreement with respect to the debt is 
reached the necessary conditions to resume growth will be there 
said nora lustig an economics professor at the colegio de mexico 
and a visiting fellow at the brookings institution in washington 
the agreement being discussed by the banks and mexico calls for 
approximately 35 percent of mexicos debt to be written off and for 
other adjustments in the debt structure to reduce the load 
some banks are reportedly asking for a clause that would increase 
payments once mexicos economy improves but upping payments might 
also cut off a recovery 
part of what mexico gains will go to buying back debt at a 
discount economists say the rest can be used for investment in 
infrastructure that could prime the pump for the private sector 
with fewer payments to make the government will need to borrow 
less money that will put less pressure on domestic credit markets 
and make more money available for the private sector at lower rates 
increased confidence would attract foreign investment and 
perhaps even more important help bring back billions invested 
abroad by wealthy mexicans capital flight according to recent 
reports has already ceased 
zaidenweber said a debt agreement will help him expand his 
textile plants to compete with imports and increase exports 
we have to grow to lower costs and get more modern equipment to 
increase quality he said 
the government has set the stage for recovery with a program that 
has pushed freemarket reforms salinas has been a driving force 
there first as budget director now as president 
nevertheless bank of mexico director miguel mancera was cautious 
the resources of the country are scarce its evident there 
isnt enough for everything we would like to do the daily el 
financiero quoted him as saying 
recovery will most likely be slow in the beginning ms 
lustig said but we might get a surprise

on archaeological ethics and the treatment of the dead to be held at 
the university of south dakota in vermillion said larry zimmerman 
a usd professor 
included in the 1200 pounds of remains are pieces of pottery and 
the dirt that was unearthed along with the bone fragments 
the florida earth will be with them zimmerman said 
the remains originally dug up by researchers and later given to 
the seminoles were sent to the university by tribal members four 
years ago under the condition that they not be used for scienctific 
study he said recently seminole tribe members asked usd officials 
to give the remains to members of the oglala tribe for burial 
the oglalas make up the majority of the population on the pine 
ridge indian reservation where wounded knee is located but remains 
from other distant indian tribes have in recent years been sent to 
wounded knee for burial 
the issue of reburial has become a heated topic in archaeological 
circles over the last decade its a subject that is often boiled 
down to a case of science vs religion zimmerman said 
the whole issue of reburial is an issue that started primarily 
in australia and among native american indians he said whats 
happened over the last decade and a half is indigenous peoples 
have become more politically active on this issue and see it as a 
twopronged concern 
is it a violation of religious freedom and who gets to use 
these remains and where do they put them 
it isnt science vs religion it is who controls the past 
he said 
archaelogists from about 20 countries and representatives from 
north american indian tribes and other indigenous people from around 
the world are expected to attend the meeting

the senate armed services committee is backing 
plans to build the expensive b2 stealth bomber but its support 
hinges on whether the plane performs as advertised 
if that plane doesnt fly the debates over said sen sam 
nunn dga the committee chairman telling reporters of the 
committee decision to impose a series of requirements before full 
production of the 500millionacopy jet 
this is really putting some teeth in fly before you buy 
said sen john warner rva the senior republican on the committee 
the military wants to buy 132 of the aircraft the stealth bomber 
is designed to evade soviet radar but has yet to fly if successful 
the jet could force the soviets to totally revamp their air defense 
system at a cost far exceeding the price tag on the b2 nunn said 
the bombers maiden flight had been planned for today in 
palmdale calif but it was delayed for at least two or three days 
because of a low fuel pressure reading on one of the planes gauges 
the air force said 
in its 305 billion defense bill approved friday the committee 
backed defense secretary dick cheney on a broad swath of issues it 
supported his decision to end production of several weapons 
including the f14d fighter jet 
but the house armed services committee last month overruled both 
cheney and its own chairman and voted to authorize production of the 
newest version of that fighter 
the senate panel parted ways with cheney when it voted to finish 
research and development of the controversial v22 osprey 
tiltrotor aircraft it invited cheney to change his mind on 
canceling that program 
the marine corps is backing the program to produce the osprey 
which takes off like a helicopter and then flies like an airplane 
but cheney decided to cancel it 
the committee approved cheneys request to end several other 
weapons programs including production of the f15e fighter after 
fiscal 1991 the apache helicopter after fiscal 1991 the army 
helicopter improvement program the phoenix missile the m88 
tankrecovery tow vehicle and an ssn688 nuclear submarine 
nunn said he expected a fight in the full senate on the 
committees decision to increase spending on the strategic defense 
initiative by 800 million next year to 45 billion thats 366 
million below the administration request 
the committee also 
endorsed a 36 percent military pay raise along with increases 
in flight pay and medical benefits 
earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste at 
department of energy military nuclear facilities to 18 billion 
418 million above the administration request additional money 
would also be provided for research on new cleanup techniques 
included 100 million for research on the proposed aerospace 
plane first proposed by former president ronald reagan which would 
take off and land like a regular jet but flies at great speeds in 
the upper atmosphere 
direct the defense department to reduce emissions of 
ozonedepleting chemicals into the atmosphere 
the committee also provided 30 million for developing lighter 
and more lethal weapons for infantry soldiers nunn said sometimes 
the infantry soldiers are given short shrift compared to the more 
complex weapons programs

the centuryold legend of an admitted cannibal has 
become grist for local jokes and promotions but a legal expert 
hopes the tools of modern forensic science will lay to rest 
questions about the case 
alferd g packer admitted eating the flesh of some of his five 
fellow gold prospectors in 1874 but claimed he did so to avert 
starvation after the men died while marooned in the san juan 
mountains he was eventually convicted of manslaughter after two 
trials nearly a decade later 
on monday a group of anthropologists archaeologists and 
pathologists will attempt to exhume the remains of the five victims 
near the mountain town of lake city about 170 miles southwest of 
denver 
the expedition is the brainchild of james e starrs a professor 
of law and forensic sciences at george washington universitys law 
center in washington 
starrs has used the packer case as an example in his classes 
because of the nature of the evidence presented at his two murder 
trials he believes scientific examination of the 115yearold 
remains will determine whether packer really killed the gold diggers 
and then ate them 
packers admitted cannibalism has made him a bizarre folkhero 
especially at the university of colorado alferd packer grill where 
annual eating contests mark the end of the school year 
the legend arose out of the colorado rockies in the winter of 
1874 
packer a 42yearold harness maker plagued with epilepsy 
convinced a group of prospectors in utah he could lead them to the 
colorado gold fields five men stayed with him until they became 
marooned in the san juan mountains 
on april 16 1874 a rosycheeked packer walked into the los 
pinos indian agency at what is now the town of sagauche 
authorities became suspicious when they found he was carrying 
several neatly wrapped packages of human flesh 
packer admitted shooting one man shannon wilson bell in self 
defense but said bell killed the other four with a hatchet while he 
was looking for a route out of the mountains he claimed starvation 
drove him to eat the flesh of the dead prospectors 
several months later packer fled just before artist john a 
randolph on assignment for harpers weekly discovered and sketched 
the five bodies 
packer was arrested in 1883 in cheyenne wyo and was taken to 
the thennew mining camp of lake city where he was convicted of 
murdering one of the prospectors israel swan 
the state supreme court overturned that sentence packer then was 
retried for all five murders and convicted of manslaughter at 
gunnison in addition to bell and swan the victims included george 
noon james humphrey and frank miller 
in 1886 packer was sentenced to 40 years he was paroled in 1901 
and died april 24 1907 
last summer starrs visited lake city and says he located the 
burial site of the five men near a bronze and stone memorial to the 
victims set amid wildlfowers and clover a mile outside of town 
until we see a bone we cant be 100 percent certain but 
the place has been maintained as a grave site since the early part 
of this century said patrick zickler editor of starrs 
scientific sleuthing review 
starrs says the bones should be in good enough condition to 
determine how the men died 
from the bones we will be able to see bullet holes and 
hatchmarks where the skinning knife might have scraped the bones 
well be able to tell if the victims were cannibalized if they were 
struck by a hatchet blow if they were really near starvation 
starrs said 
my personal feelings are well find more bullet wounds than 
described zickler said my pet theory is that bell and packer 
conspired against the others because of the general desperation of 
the situation for some reason well never know packer and bell had 
a falling out packer emerged victorious and bell became a perfect 
scapegoat for all the other deaths 
many of the 219 permanent residents of lake city hope the dig 
will raise the towns profile as a vacation spot 
at the general store proprietor jack eisele is selling buttons 
that read alferd packer ate herelake city co 
tshirts for sale in several shops proclaim have a friend for 
dinner and alferd packer serving his fellow man 
the menu at murphys restaurant includes packers platter for 
those with a maneating appetite 
a theater group from western state college in gunnison on monday 
will open a threeweek nightly dramatization of packers trial in 
the lake city courthouse where the original trial took place

the first flight of the b2 stealth bomber 
was delayed for at least two or three days because of a low 
fuelpressure reading on one of the advanced bombers gauges the 
air force said today 
the problem occurred as a small aircraft strayed into the 
airspace surrounding the site and made a surprise landing the 
cessna 182 played no role in the decision to scrub the flight said 
air force col douglas kennett 
we decided to postpone for safety reasons alone kennett 
said there was no other reason we err on the side of safety 
the pilot of the cessna was being interviewed by los angeles 
county sheriffs investigators kennett said the pilot who was 
apparently lost was questioned but was not under arrest his 
singleengine plane also carried two children 
the twoman b2 crew had taxied to the end of the runway and was 
in preparation for takeoff when the crew members observed that fuel 
pressure gauge readings for takeoff were too low 
despite the great anticipation and expectation of a maiden voyage 
for the b2 today the air force was not disappointed by the delay 
kennett said 
we are still ready he said we will be up when it is time 
we are still looking forward to the first flight 
air force officials had feverishly prepared the radarevading 
500 million b2 for its maiden flight after a key capitol hill 
committee ruled against funding the batwinged aircraft until it 
leaves the ground 
at 635 am nearly an hour after sunrise the b2 emerged from 
its hangar and began its slow roll down the runway in anticipation 
of the first flight 
the plane was arrayed with radar enhancers reflective material 
installed at eight points on the leading edge of its wing and seven 
points on the trailing edge the enhancers were needed to allow test 
personnel to keep track of the radarevading aircraft during its 
maiden flight 
aviation buffs who hoped to catch a glimpse of the bombers first 
flight began gathering outside the perimeter of air force plant 42 
early today air force spokesman maj pat mullaney said several 
dozen were already in place at 2 am mullaney said 
the 500 million stealth bomber prototype concluded highspeed 
runway tests on thursday with the menacing craft lifting its nose 
wheel briefly in the last step toward flight 
plans had been for the radarevading bomber take off from air 
force plant 42 here and then land two hours later at nearby edwards 
air force base 
while the b2 was being prepared for flight congressional 
opposition over its cost threatened to ground the craft 
the senate armed services committee in approving president 
bushs 3055 billion defensespending request for fiscal 1990 
stipulated friday that no new money be spent on the bomber until it 
flies 
if that plane doesnt fly the debate is over said sen sam 
nunn dga the panels chairman it is far too expensive to be a 
stealth taxi 
last week the pentagon announced the first flight tests of the 
bomber 18 months behind schedule would be held during the next 
two weeks 
the pentagon is proposing a 47 billion budget in fiscal 1990 
for the b2 manufactured by northrop corp in palmdale the plane 
will cost about 24 billion over a threeyear peak period beginning 
in fiscal 1992 according to defense department figures 
the department has invested about 224 billion in the plane so 
far 
the pentagon hopes to purchase 132 of the bombers

a 45minute chat between nelson 
mandela and president pw botha has thrown government and 
antiapartheid forces off balance as they try to adjust their 
policies to the unprecedented event 
the meeting july 5 between the imprisoned african national 
congress leader and the retiring president caused confusion on all 
sides 
the exiled anc described the meeting as a publicity stunt but as 
praise poured in from other antiapartheid groups it withheld 
further comment 
it may be that the 73yearold botha facing forced retirement at 
the hands of the national party he controlled for 10 years gave 
history a push just to spite his designated successor 
the heir apparent fw de klerk has not commented on the 
meeting in cape town and the government seems to be scrambling to 
explain it without losing too many votes to the white rightwing in 
september parliamentary elections 
apparently preparing the groundwork for mandelas release the 
government is transforming its portrayal of him from a violent 
revolutionary to a statesman worthy of negotiating with the nations 
white leaders 
ambiguity extends even to mandela who turns 71 on july 18 and is 
serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the 
government he insists he has not changed his views during 27 years 
in prison he has not met the governments demand for an outright 
renunciation of violence and he continues to call for the removal 
of a ban on the exiled anc 
but mandela in a statement released by prison services a week 
after he met botha said i only would like to contribute to the 
creation of the climate which would promote peace in south africa 
the policy of the anc and most sympathetic antiapartheid groups 
has been that no negotiations with the government are possible until 
mandela is freed yet the meeting and mandelas statement can be 
interpreted as indicating mandela has already begun a form of 
negotiation 
justice minister kobie coetsee who arranged and attended the 
meeting at bothas official residence first described it as a 
courtesy visit a week later he declared it a breakthrough 
foreign minister pik botha mindful of the need to improve south 
africas image abroad called it an event of the utmost historic 
importance 
information minister stoffel van der merwe aware of the danger 
of startling white voters before the elections said the meeting was 
part of the broader process of preparing the groundwork for future 
negotiations 
only the extremeright proapartheid conservative party has made 
its position clear conservative party leader andries treurnicht 
attacked the government for talking to the anc and said its 
attempt to enhance mandelas status to that of a folk hero is 
transparent and will not work 
progovernment news media presented mandelas commitment to peace 
as a dramatic change but it is new in south africa only because 
mandelas views have been suppressed for so long 
mandelas words made headlines around the country and were read 
on governmentrun television and radio his picture which cannot be 
published legally has been printed in major newspapers whose 
editors believe they will not be prosecuted 
first reactions from mandelas wife winnie and from the rev 
frank chikane secretarygeneral of the south african council of 
churches suggested mandela may have been forced into the meeting or 
been unaware of its implications 
mrs mandela and chikane reversed course after mandelas 
statement saying the discussions were a positive development rather 
than a government ploy 
anc spokesman tom sebina said in lusaka zambia it would be 
wrong for anybody to believe that the meeting signified the start of 
negotiations between the black people of south africa and the 
national party government 
he did not react to mandelas statement but his comment 
contained an important shift he referred to the government 
instead of the apartheid regime 
mandela as a free man able to act as a politician rather than a 
symbol poses problems that the anc has not fully addressed 
although he is regarded as the anc leader the highest post 
mandela held before the organization was outlawed in 1960 was 
deputypresident general the anc has a president oliver tambo who 
has lived in exile for 29 years 
mandela had set guidelines for the ancs military wing calling 
for carefully considered attacks on government targets and arguing 
against acts that would cause indiscriminate deaths as the ancs 
bombing campaign has done 
the majority of mandelas supporters were born after he was 
jailed have never heard his words and have grown up in an 
environment of blackonblack township political strife that did not 
exist in 1962 
there has been built up around him such a folklore hero role 
that he would be recieved as a hero said helen suzman a white 
antiapartheid member of parliament but how does one know what 
hes going to suggest to them and what they are prepared to accept

its not even the same bridge 
anymore new posts and guardrails have been added but that was some 
time ago and now dike bridge is rotting gulls fly over and drop 
shellfish on it to break open their supper 
not much to it no signs no reminders 
but dike bridge is on chappaquiddick 
it lives oversized in american political history because sen 
edward m kennedy drove his oldsmobile off the bridge into poucha 
pond around midnight 20 years ago 
mary jo kopechne a 28yearold washington secretary was found 
dead in the back seat about 10 hours later kennedy then 37 did 
not notify police until 930 am long after he returned to his 
hotel across the water on marthas vineyard 
he said he and two friends repeatedly dove to the car in 
unsuccessful rescue attempts and that he was then exhausted and 
in a state of shock 
since the accident the night of july 18 1969 massachusetts 
voters have reelected kennedy four times to the senate by healthy 
margins but most people think the string of events that occurred 
after he left a cottage party that night probably cost him the white 
house 
the incident has been an albatross around the islands neck as 
well 
like kennedy most longtime chappaquiddick residents dont like 
to discuss the accident it is a bitter memory the day their 
pastoral existence became the focus of the worst sort of publicity 
the heir to the kennedy family dynasty had sullied not just his 
reputation but theirs too 
when asked about the accident and the impact its had on their 
lives vineyarders who have lived in edgartown or on chappaquiddick 
island for more than 20 years often become silent 
one edgartown real estate agent usually smiling and friendly 
momentarily choked up when asked about the accident and then refused 
to discuss it 
jane tomassian the head of the marthas vineyard historical 
preservation society has lived in edgartown eight years she has 
sensed some of her neighbors resentment about the incident 
marthas vineyard prechappaquiddick was sort of a quiet 
vacation spot the international attention that centered here 
immediately after the incident and during the trial and the focus 
that has been put on the vineyard since then has really 
unfortunately put the vineyard on the map tomassian said 
kennedy eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an 
accident and received a twomonth suspended prison sentence he was 
placed on probation for one year 
judge james a boyle who oversaw the ninemonth inquest 
expressed doubt about key portions of kennedys testimony when 
boyles final report was released in april 1970 the case was 
officially closed but public debate over its ramifications 
continues 
the dike bridge connects a beautiful strip of beach with the rest 
of chappaquiddick island at the eastern side of marthas vineyard 
in may tall fences were erected on either side of the bridge long 
since closed to vehicular traffic and the only way to reach the 
beach now is to drive an allterrain vehicle south for about five 
miles before doubling back north 
town officials are concerned about safety at the bridge but 
sporadic arguments over the years reveal another factor in the move 
to tear it down embarrassment over the dubious tourist attraction 
most tourists dont journey to marthas vineyard soley to see the 
scene of what has been called the most famous traffic fatality in 
the history of american politics but as long as theyre down 
there its right across the ferry 
yeah people ask about it every day said a teenage girl 
running the fourcar ferry from edgartown to chappaquiddick island 
we get a car asking on every trip across 
once tourists get out to dike bridge theres not a lot to see 
just a simple wooden bridge across a decidedly uninteresting pond 
beyond the bridge are the dunes and still farther the vast blue of 
nantucket sound 
they find themselves very disappointed said patric jamo a 
waiter at a restaurant on the edge of edgartown harbor theres 
really nothing there 
linda malcouronne the president of the edgartown board of trade 
and manager of the colonial inn contends the bridge isnt that much 
of a tourist draw she says most of the summertime tourists choose 
the vineyard for other reasons and visitors might not even be aware 
of the significance of the bridge 
its a whole other time a time warp malcouronne said 
whether the islanders like it or not though the accident is 
fixed in their psyche a headline that appeared in the vineyard 
gazette referred to the debate over tearing down the kennedy 
bridge 
just up the block from the colonial inn is the shiretown inn the 
hotel where kennedy stayed on his visit two decades ago kennedy had 
walked through the hotels lobby the morning of the accident and 
stood on a balcony talking about yachts with other vacationers 
before he filed an accident report with the edgartown police 
the new owners of the shiretown have taken down a sign that hung 
behind the front desk telling people not to bother asking about 
chappaquiddick or what room kennedy was staying in but they still 
shun inquiries 
we have no comment said a hotel worker who wouldnt give her 
name people dont ask about it its not a big thing anymore we 
werent even around then 
kennedy who has over the years expressed sadness about the 
accident responded with a prepared statement when asked about the 
incident recently 
i took full responsibility for the tragedy at the time and i 
still do kennedy said there was a full and complete 
investigation by authorities and there have been extensive 
additional investigations by the press i have expressed my remorse 
and responsibility to my own family to the kopechne family and to 
the people of massachusetts and i express those sentiments again 
i have told everything i know about the accident i only wish 
that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing 
pain that i feel and that mr and mrs kopechne feel for mary jos 
loss 
in a recent associated press interview mary jo kopechnes 
parents spoke mostly about how they still grieve over the loss of 
their daughter 
mrs kopechne did say she was pleased the foreman in the grand 
jury investigation of her daughters death had recently renewed his 
assertion that officials tried to cover up information to protect 
kennedy 
she had little to say about kennedy but in another interview 
with a magazine she and her husband had harsh words for the senator 
he was worried about himself not mary jo joseph kopechne 
said 
he said his daughter did not die in vain because it kept kennedy 
from becoming president 
kopechne and his wife gwen said they had had two brief meetings 
with the senator since the accident 
those were really ridiculous meetings mrs kopechne said 
nobody told me anything and i didnt even know what to ask i 
want him to tell me what happened cant he relieve us of this

martial law has not changed the summer rhythm of 
this dusty city a hot sun hypnotizes its 10 million residents into 
slow motion and soldiers stand sleepily under bright umbrellas 
the soldiers squint and play idly with the safety catches on 
their automatic rifles it is possible to catch them napping 
stocking feet sticking out the windows of a parked army jeep 
some people stroll up to them boldly ask them where they are 
from and offer them soda 
but despite the mantralike assurances of city authorities 
beijing has not returned to normal arrests continue of people who 
took part in the studentled protests for democratic reform some 
people are taken away as looking suspicious questioned beaten 
and released 
a bookstore where liberals used to meet has been closed the 
latest issue of a magazine has been halted at the post office 
because of an article that censors deemed harmful 
books by scholars who are wanted by police have been banned and 
culture ministry workers have raided private bookstalls to seize 
copies at least one book has been banned even as it was being 
published a chinese source said 
countless people pass their days in fear of punishment under the 
governments harsh new policy emphasizing class struggle and the 
need to stamp out westernstyle liberalism 
i invited you to come to our home for lunch and we bought beer 
and things to make dumplings but im sorry you cant come a 
chinese intellectual said with embarrassment as he met a western 
friend recently 
they said foreigners should not come to our homes he 
explained even meeting a westerner in public made him fearful and 
he cast nervous glances around him 
things will get better lets wait a few months he said 
before merging with relief into the crowd 
he was brave to keep the appointment many chinese have stopped 
answering their telephones and few are willing to talk to foreigners 
its like the cultural revolution said a european reporter 
who was in china during the 196676 upheaval during which almost 
all contact between chinese and foreigners was forbidden 
asked about the restrictions government spokesman yuan mu said 
it was for the foreigners protection because there are so many 
chinese and you dont know who is good and who is bad it is not 
written on their foreheads 
all over the city hundreds of thousands of teachers doctors 
journalists and factory workers who cheered or joined in the 
7weeklong protests face investigation 
most will not be arrested predicted a chinese source but they 
will spend several tense weeks as communist party officials at their 
work units investigate their cases at a minimum they will be 
required to acknowledge the error of their ways the source said 
political education already has begun for work units protesters 
and bystanders alike graduating college students spent several 
weeks studying speeches by top leaders condemning the protests as 
the work of traitors 
participants were urged to speak their hearts according to one 
official newspaper but several said they just repeated words from 
the speeches 
teachers also have had long study sessions education appears 
lightest for production line workers who are being pressed to make 
up for the losses of the weeks of protest 
testimonials from protesters have begun appearing in the official 
media confessing their actions but saying they now understand and 
approve the governments crackdown 
motherland country we were wrong said one statement 
attributed to a group of students 
the relaxed attitude of the soldiers belies the tight security 
new plainclothes guards watch comings and goings at foreign 
apartment compounds and several embassies including the american 
embassy where leading dissident fang lizhi has taken shelter 
chinese who enter a major office tower must show identification 
switchboard operators at some chinese government units demand 
callers identify themselves before putting them through 
soldiers check the papers of chinese who emerge from their 
stifling homes at night to catch a cool breeze on the sidewalk 
after 11 pm soldiers stop cars at main intersections and question 
drivers 
when an army motorcycle broke down during the day on one street 
a jeep of armed soldiers stopped to guard it while repairs were made 
when two bicyclists got into an argument drawing a small crowd 
soldiers quickly dispersed it 
and yet the security appears to have gaps a foreigner recently 
reported seeing a naked body floating in a canal near his home

a custody battle has begun over notebooks kept 
by former national security aide oliver north during the irancontra 
affair the nsc wont take them despite a claim by norths 
prosecutors that it is the rightful owner 
prosecutors were rebuffed by the bush administration when they 
attempted to turn over the copies to the nsc staff last month 
administration and congressional sources say 
the administration is concerned that once the security council 
regains possession congress can move to have the long soughtafter 
documents declassified an administration source acknowledged 
the justice department is looking at legal questions surrounding 
a possible transfer of the spiralbound notebooks department 
spokesman david runkel said north still holds the originals 
according to sources independent counsel lawrence walsh assured 
senate foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell in a 
letter june 23 that the prosecutor would send copies of the 
notebooks to the nsc so that they might be made available to 
congress 
the senate panel has been trying since april 1988 to subpoena the 
notebooks which north took with him the day he was fired from the 
nsc on nov 25 1986 his lawyers blacked out portions of 1269 of 
the 2848 pages of copies supplied to the irancontra investigating 
committees 
the books contain norths handwritten daily records of meetings 
and phone calls about the iran arms sales and secret assistance to 
the contras they also contain references to allegations of 
narcotics trafficking in connection with various arms dealers who 
were supplying the contras 
during walshs investigation of north north invoked his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination in initially refusing to 
turn them over but north had to submit them three months ago when 
he decided to testify near the close of his criminal trial 
pell drhode island pressed walsh for copies in a letter june 
20 to which walsh responded three days later 
it is my understanding that the national security council 
rergards these notebooks as its documents walsh said we shall 
supply a copy of these documents to the national security council 
along with a copy of your letter expressing a need for them 
it would then be appropriate for your counsel to 
request the declassification of these documents so that they could 
be utilized by the committee 
a courier from the independent counsels office subsequently 
tried to deliver the copies said one source familiar with the 
episode 
when nsc staffers opened a package containing the copies they 
refused to take custody of them saying theyre not the property of 
the nsc said the source 
it was somebodys assumption at the independent counsels 
office that if we send it theyll take it said one 
administration source familiar with the matter 
some of the concern has to do with distribution after they get 
to the executive branch one bush administration official 
acknowledged referring to congress interest in obtaining the 
notebooks 
runkel of the justice department said there has been no 
determination about what should be done with the prosecutors 
copies or whether we should seek to get the notebooks back from 
north himself 
runkel declined further comment at walshs office spokeswoman 
mary belcher declined all comment on the notebooks 
north was compelled to produce them to prosecutors under an april 
6 court order by us district judge gerhard a gesell 
one question is whether gesell intended to restrict the 
independent counsels authority to turn its copies over to someone 
else said one bush administration official 
this can be simply resolved go ask judge gesell said the 
official the independent counsel is afraid north is going to 
object the right way is to give notice that they would be inclined 
to turn over the notebooks to the nsc and give north a chance to be 
heard 
the wording of gesells order places no restrictions on what 
walsh may do with the notebooks 
it says simply that north shall forthwith produce to the 
government spiral bound notebooks used in the course of 
andor to assist him in his duties at the national security 
council from october 1984 to nov 25 1986 
ultimately ownership of the the notebooks will have to be 
determined said another administration source 
if they are presidential records they probably belong to the 
reagan administration and would go to the reagan library in 
california said the bush administration source its pretty 
clear the documents dont belong to this administration theyre not 
bush presidency documents 
north testified in his trial that he regarded the notebooks as 
his personal property and that he had intended to destroy them as 
one of his last acts at the nsc 
north testified that he took them away with him the day he was 
fired because his lawyer at the time thomas green had advised him 
to do so 
i was advised to keep things that would indicate that i had 
authority from reagan administration higherups for his activities 
in the irancontra affair said north who was convicted of three 
felonies in the scandal 
prosecutors at his trial were able to make almost no use of the 
thousands of pages of notebooks in crossexamining north because he 
had been forced to give them the material only a few days earlier

the national antidrug strategy due out this 
fall must look beyond the big cities and address the rapid spread of 
the cocaine derivative crack to rural areas sen lloyd bentsen said 
saturday 
bentsen said he is asking national drug control director william 
bennett who is drawiing up the antidrug blueprint to include 
measures to combat the serious and growing problem of drug abuse 
in smaller towns and the rural countryside 
the texas democrat said he wants to be sure the drug enforcement 
administration doesnt limit its efforts to just the big dealers 
and the big cities that we include rural and small towns too 
in one rural texas area authorities report an 80 percent 
increase in crack cases in just one year bentsen said 
if you ignore that kind of an increase you do so at your own 
peril bentsen said in his letter to bennett its absolutely 
imperative that we have an overall program that takes care of not 
just the large cities but the small towns rural areas in addition 
bennett must complete the first comprehensive national 
drugcontrol plan by sept 5 
bentsen said he was concerned about a recent dea memorandum that 
said crack dealers in smaller communities do not merit full 
federal investigative efforts since they typically limit their 
sales to small quantities 
a dea survey in 1986 found crack available in 28 states and the 
district of columbia another dea survey in december 1987 found that 
number had jumped to 45 states bentsen said 
and while the survey noted that crack cocaine remained primarily 
an inner city problem it noted that recent seizures indicate that 
crack has appeared in rural parts of georgia mississippi 
louisiana florida alabama north carolina delaware maryland new 
york and california

eight weeks before the primary ed kochs job is 
clear he either makes up ground fast or makes plans to step aside 
for new york citys first black mayor or its first republican mayor 
in two decades 
sixteen points in this day and age is not an insurmountable 
margin by any means as i was telling president dukakis quipped 
david garth kochs media adviser on friday 
garth was as surprised as anyone thursday when koch chose a 
midday radio talk show to announce officially his candidacy for an 
unprecedented fourth term not that there was any doubt he made 
his intentions obvious last year and started television ads this 
month 
i think ive done a lot of good things ive done a couple of 
stupid things said koch 64 ive done things that i would do 
over and differently but thats water over the dam 
i believe that my three terms will be perceived historically as 
very good for the city of new york 
his opponents and many pundits think the outspoken koch already 
is history david dinkins the manhattan borough president leads 
koch by 13 to 15 points in democratic polls the latest had him 
ahead 45 percent to 31 percent getting more than 40 percent of the 
vote in the sept 12 primary would enable dinkins to avoid a primary 
runoff 
the likely republican is former federal prosecutor rudolph 
giuliani who is far ahead of his gop rival cosmetics heir ronald 
lauder a daily newswabctv poll looking ahead to likely november 
matchups puts giuliani neck and neck with dinkins and ahead of 
koch 49 percent to 33 percent 
two other democrats comptroller harrison goldin and former 
transit chief richard ravitch remain stalled in single digits in 
their primary bids 
whats going on i think is the public is shutting its mind to 
ed koch after 12 insulting years said mark green a dinkins 
adviser and former senate candidate i think i hear a collective 
enough already 
koch received 78 percent of the vote last time he ran back in 
1985 when voters didnt have aids crack and homelessness in mind 
his third term began with a corruption scandal now all but 
overshadowed by more pressing human problems 
do you know anyone who has solved aids or solved drugs or 
housing in this country koch asks 
his issueoriented tv ads featuring regular folks carry the 
slogan he tackles the tough ones in what is still the second 
toughest job in america 
that still leaves corruption crime education and race this 
last issue possibly crucial koch rankled blacks with his criticism 
of the rev jesse jackson in last years presidential primary and 
73 percent of blacks polled say they favor dinkins the first black 
with a real shot at the mayors mansion 
the 62yearold dinkins a relatively quiet conciliatory 
politician delivered 135386 signatures to the board of elections 
on thursday far more than he needed and more than three times what 
koch collected 
im sure hes pretty good at arithmetic and he would recognize 
that this reflects an awful lot of support a broad base dinkins 
said 
said koch who began his political career as a reformer but 
twice was reelected with the backing of democratic powers hes 
the machine candidate what would you expect 
there have been other ironies so far in the campaign 
giuliani 45 who built his reputation busting wall streeters 
mobsters and corrupt officials found himself last week defending 
the hiring of three lawyers who admitted having used drugs 
koch of all people paraphrased jackson in thursdays 
announcement i dont think god is finished with me yet and i want 
to do more for this city 
then there is lauders multimilliondollar television onslaught 
in which a voice dripping with disgust calls giuliani a liberal 
a complicating factor in the race is the existence in new york of 
small conservative and liberal parties which enable candidates to 
run even if they lose one of the two major primaries 
giuliani has already been endorsed by the liberal party as was 
republican john lindsay in 1965 and would run on that ticket in 
addition to the gop ticket if he wins in september 
but giulianis stance against abortion has reduced his support 
the daily newswabctv poll indicated gays have criticized his 
opposition to kochs proposal to extend paid time off to city 
employees grieving deaths of livein companions 
lauder who entered the race at the urging of republican sen 
alfonse damato a rival of giuliani will likely remain in the race 
on the conservative line and the votes he would get could hurt 
giuliani in a close general election 
for his part garth says koch has been creeping up in the polls 
from the mid20s to the low 30s my feeling is hes bottomed out 
and is now moving up garth said adding that polls dont show 
dinkins supporters as particularly ardent 
the way this business usually works once you make that turn 
and start to come back you gather momentum he said 
green said koch is behind because hes an insult artist yet 
the more he now attacks dave dinkins the more he reminds people 
what they like least about him i dont see how he gets out of this 
box 
countered garth theres no way to kill the spirit in him

the countrys largest black 
union said saturday it wants to form a huge antiapartheid coalition 
to coordinate strategies among opposition groups 
the national union of mineworkers said it will seek to arrange a 
conference no later than october to bring together the core forces 
of the mass democratic movement 
it is important to win over all antiapartheid forces to our 
side said the union which has about 300000 members 
antiapartheid groups have been urgently trying to formulate 
unified strategies since the july 5 meeting between president pw 
botha and jailed black nationalist nelson mandela leader of the 
african national congress 
opposition groups initially dismissed the talks as government 
propaganda that involved no shift in policy but several 
organizations revised their assessment and called it a positive 
development after mandela released a statement wednesday indicating 
he welcomed the chance to talk with botha 
the mineworkers union said the congress of south african trade 
unions the countrys largest labor federation and the united 
democratic front the largest antiapartheid coalition would play 
leading roles in the coalition it sought to establish 
however both groups are banned from participating in political 
activities 
the mineworkers did not explain how these organizations could 
become active in politics 
the outlawed anc and other antiapartheid groups have said there 
can be no negotiations with the government until it meets several 
basic demands such as freeing all political prisoners legalizing 
banned organizations and lifting the state of emergency 
the antiapartheid movement has found it increasingly difficult 
to organize under the 3yearold state of emergency during which 
more than 30 opposition groups have been banned 
mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
his meeting with botha suggests the anc leader is willing to talk 
with the government though his demand for a nonracial democracy in 
south africa is unchanged 
the whiteled government also appears to have eased its policy of 
having no contact with the anc which it labels a terrorist 
organization 
under south africas apartheid policies the 28 million blacks 
have no voice in national affairs the 5 million whites control the 
government and economy while maintaining separate neighborhoods 
schools and health facilities

mayor coleman young is preparing to announce 
whether he will run for a fifth term this week as even some of his 
supporters say he should step down at age 71 
eight weeks remain before the sept 12 nonpartisan primary when 
voters will select two candidates for a nov 7 runoff 
young the citys first black mayor is expected to announce his 
plans tuesday he has hinted for months that he would run but left 
open the possibility he would retire 
if i announce then i will announce when i announce young 
said a comment typical in tone of his chilly relations with 
reporters which his aides blame in part on media racism 
young if he does run for another fouryear term would enter as 
the solid frontrunner able to cite progress in areas such as 
integrating the police force but also in spite of an array of 
problems facing the city 
he has a largely untapped campaign fund estimated at 5 million 
and is considered to hold a commanding lead over accountant thomas 
barrow who won the right to face him in the runoff four years ago 
and is expected to do so again this year barrow reportedly has less 
than 300000 available for his campaign 
young a former union organizer has been in office since 1973 
the same year tom bradley of los angeles and maynard jackson of 
atlanta came to power in the early generation of bigcity black 
mayors 
barrow 40 is founder and president of michigans largest 
minorityowned accounting firm and a nephew of the late boxing great 
joe louis he received only 39 percent of the vote when he ran 
against young in 1985 but this year has been campaigning 
doortodoor while young schedules about four public appearances a 
week nonchalantly skipping some of them 
other challengers include detroit city council president erma 
henderson and longshots charles costa and james a williams sr the 
filing deadline for candidates is july 25 
barrow and the others blame young for the continuing decline of 
detroits neighborhoods opponents say young has concentrated on pet 
downtown development projects at the expense of neighborhood upkeep 
and services 
and some longtime supporters including detroits veteran black 
congressmen john conyers and george crockett also say it is time 
for detroit to have a new mayor 
crockett said he thinks young should step down for his own 
health though young has no outward signs of decline crockett who 
turns 80 next month said he can give a younger man such advice 
because he has fewer problems in congress than young has as mayor 
conyers was more outspoken accusing the mayor of arrogance and 
saying he has an unbroken record of personal and political 
mistakes in the last few years 
colemans dead conyers said its time for him to go he 
said the mayor has lost sight of serving the people and has 
created a political machine interested only in its own power 
conyers denies his comments are meant to promote a candidacy by 
brother nathan a detroit businessman nathan conyers also denies he 
has any interest in being mayor 
young an ardent civil rights activist in this predominantly 
black city seemed to emerge unscathed politically last year after 
criticizing the rev jesse jacksons presidential campaign saying a 
black man had no legitimate chance of winning and backing 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
but the mayor has other problems 
detroits population has dropped from about 2 million in 1950 to 
about 1 million today the flight to outlying suburbs has left 
behind thousands of boardedup burnedout houses that attract drug 
dealers and other crime some fedup residents tired of waiting for 
city demolition crews have even torn down abandoned houses 
themselves 
though youngs opponents have avoided mention of it young also 
faces a paternity suit filed against him by annivory calvert a 
former assistant director in detroits department of public works 
who now lives in california 
young who is single at first denied the child was his but in 
may blood tests proved he was the father of ms calverts 
6yearold son joel loving the mayor is paying 200 a week in 
child support until the court sets a final amount 
other issues facing the mayor include 
detroits trashburning incinerator which has angered 
environmentalists who say pollution standards for the 420 million 
project to create energy by burning wastes are too low 
a deal involving the citys acquisition of land for a 1 billion 
chrysler corp assembly plant which is being investigated by a 
federal grand jury amid charges the city paid 40 million for used 
machinery worth 2 million in condemned buildings on the plant site 
theres no suggestion that young himself is suspected of criminal 
wrongdoing 
youngs hostile relations with reporters and negative coverage 
that the mayors staff blames on institutional racism young 
rebuffed numerous requests for an interview by the associated press 
young has been particularly unhappy with local coverage of the 
police force a oncepredominantly white department whose racial 
integration has been a source of pride for the mayor 
fred martin youngs chief executive assistant said the makeover 
of the force was ignored by local media specifically martin said 
a group of newspaper columnists constantly dump on the mayor 
we do think there is a little different standard for coleman 
young he said im not saying that it is conscious or 
deliberate

hud has turned over to the justice department 
records that show a former top official passed over 
financiallystrapped housing projects in favor of doling out 
emergency funds to a onetime business associate and donors to his 
pet charity 
the department of housing and urban developments inspector 
general concluded in a march audit that at least 11 of 25 projects 
funded through the emergency setaide program in 1987 and 1988 did 
not meet agency guidelines several wellconnected developers 
received multiple awards from the fund 
seven projects that exceeded guidelines were bypassed they 
eventually went under and had to be taken over by hud which over 
time will cost the government millions of dollars the auditors 
concluded 
hud investigators said those decisions were made by thomas t 
demery who at the time was huds assistant secretary for housing 
he left the agency last year and opened a consulting business but 
has been beleaguered of late with questions about his actions at hud 
the department is the focus of internal congressional and 
justice department investigations of fraud mismanagement and 
influencepeddling during president reagans tenure 
demery 39 in a brief interview thursday denied favoritism 
played a role in any funding decisions it was all done on the 
merits he said 
but department officials in the report that hud sources said has 
been forwarded to justice as part of its investigation of the 
troubled housing agency said assistance was provided to projects 
that were neither approvable under the regulations nor demonstrated 
an emergency need the sources spoke on condition they not be 
identified 
the section 8 loan management set aside fund is used to help 
struggling housing projects that already have some type of 
government financing guidelines allow the emergency assistance in 
cases when low occupancy or other problems have caused severe 
financial problems the infusion of hud money through the use of 
lowincome rent subsidies is designed to prevent a more costly 
default 
the emergency accounts totaled 42 million during the twoyear 
audit period 36 million of that went to the 11 questionable 
projects chosen by demery for help 
of those 11 six did not demonstrate a cashflow problem and the 
five others were ineligible for funding because of poor maintenance 
management or other problems hud investigators concluded in 
addition some of the projects had not even applied locally for 
funding and in other cases local hud officials had rejected 
applications the auditors said 
the investigators said they could find no documentation to 
support demerys decisions 
what can be found through review of the hud records demerys 
financial disclosure statements and other records is that demery had 
past ties to at least one of the developers who got emergency 
funding several others were contributors to food for africa a 
michiganbased charity demery helped found 
a separate audit of a hud rehabilitation program also found 
scores of occasions in which food donors won lucrative government 
subsidies demery attended several fundraisers for the charity that 
were hosted by developers he has repeatedly denied that the 
donations affected his hud decisions 
a review of demerys telephone and appointment logs by the 
associated press also indicated that several of the developers who 
got emergency funding called demery several times in the period that 
those and other funding decisions about their hud projects were made 
emergency funding went to two projects owned by robert 
rohlwing with whom demery in 1984 was involved in a small mortgage 
venture one of the projects was poorly maintained and the other 
scored zero on a test for need auditors said demery awarded 
rohlwing 342000 immediately with the possibility he could get up 
to 17 million over several years rohlwing donated 1000 to food 
in 1987 
demerys phone logs obtained through the freedom of information 
act show numerous calls from rohlwing rohlwing did not return a 
reporters telephone call to his chicago office last week 
another name found a number of times on the logs is that of 
allan bird a developer of more than 100 hud projects who got 
405000 in emergency funding for an apartment complex in boston 
that failed quality standards to make repairs bird got an 
additional 1 million from hud he donated 2500 to food in 1987 
demery awarded 142000 to the amy jo manor in grand rapids 
mich a project auditors said did not meet requirements for 
emergency aid the project is owned by a group called pm one inc 
which donated 2000 to food a related company also donated to the 
charity 
the president of pm one inc daniel armstead did not return a 
telephone call to his michigan office 
demery in 1984 received a fee of at least 5000 from a related 
company pmi inc for consulting work at the time he was a 
michigan real estate consultant and mortgage broker who did some hud 
contracting work 
one of the owners of another projects that received emergency 
assistance jeffrey i friedman also donated 1000 to food in 
october 1987 the auditors however did not question the 
eligibility of that project somerset west apartments in north 
royalton ohio which received 180000 from demery 
seven of the 25 projects given emergency funding over the 
twoyear period were in demerys home state of michigan his phone 
logs show he kept close ties with his business associates there 
often receiving several calls a day from michigan developers 
irving seligman a southfield mich developer who got emergency 
assistance for three projects that auditors said were not eligible 
said the frequency of the awards to michigan was not due to 
favoritism but because of struggling developments in lowincome 
areas 
demery approved 426000 in emergency funding for two projects 
seligman owned in taylor mich over the objections of local hud 
and government officials who said the area already had too much 
subsidized housing the third project in phoenix got 347000 even 
though it already had more subsidized apartments than hud guidelines 
allowed the auditors said 
seligman said he knew demery from his hudrelated work in 
michigan in the early 1980s and spoke to him often but he said he 
did not believe he had any special influence with demery who has 
said he approved the funding because he thought the local objections 
stemmed from a personality clash

for the first time in its 30year 
history the new athens homecoming pageant wont have a miss new 
athens to crown 
none of the towns teenage girls wanted to compete for the 
crowning sunday night organizers say 
maybe theres a change in the wind said donimae rauch 
cochairman of the homecoming committee it might be a thing of 
the past it is a shame to see it go 
the contest sponsored by the new athens womens club is not a 
beauty pageant rather the girl age 16 to 19 who sells the most 1 
tickets for raffle chances automatically becomes homecoming queen 
rauch said 
the money collected benefits the new athens commercial club 
which promotes business and industry in new athens and the 
surrounding area 
i am a little disappointed that nobody shows that much interest 
in helping the town nd raising the money miss new athens 1988 
denise range said but hopefully it will happen again next year 
the queen receives a cash prize plus a commission jewelry a 
sterling silver bowl a tiara and a portrait session 
for some reason this year we didnt find anyone willing to win 
a guaranteed 500 first prize plus a percentage of sales over 
1000 rauch said 
laurel ruhmann who became miss new athens in 1985 after selling 
2000 tickets isnt surprised by the lack of interest 
i can kind of understand she said its hard work 
the pageant wont have a queen but it might still have a raffle 
high school cheerleaders are selling tickets as are the towns 
rotary club lions club and fellowship of christian athletes 
next year the new athens committee might open the contest to 
boys just as neighboring marissa is doing this year 
were going to keep an eye on that rauch said it is a 
very valid possibility and something we might consider

joseph b gildenhorn the lawyer and real 
estate developer named by president bush as us ambassador to 
switzerland and his immediate family gave nearly 230000 to 
republican campaigns since 1984 disclosure statements show 
gildenhorn according to senate sources is one of several bush 
ambassadorial nominees who have been rated unqualified by the 
american academy of diplomacy an organization composed of former 
high ranking diplomats including all living former secretaries of 
state 
one of a lengthy and growing list of bush supporters and 
contributors named to diplomatic posts gildenhorn gave 100000 
during the 1988 presidential campaign to the republican national 
state elections committee the gift was not subject to the 
disclosure requirements of the federal election campaign act 
the 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by 
gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by 
senate democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many gop 
contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved 
for foreign service professionals 
gildenhorn said friday he could not comment because he is in a 
confirmation process 
a report prepared by the state department for the foreign 
relations committee said gildenhorn would make an excellent 
candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in 
law and management 
it also cited another qualification 
mr gildenhorn has been a strong republican supporter being a 
member of the eagles and team 100 the state department said 
the republican eagles are contributors of 10000 or more in a 
single year to the republican national committee while team 100 
designates people who have donated 100000 or more 
gildenhorns political contributions are listed on a disclosure 
form submitted to the senate foreign relations committee which has 
set a hearing on the nomination for this week 
they totaled 14675 in 1984 17000 in 1985 2546997 in 
1986 25250 in 1987 104350 in 1988 and 11000 this year the 
total 19774497 
additionally his wife alma lee gave 20125 over the six 
years including 13000 in 1988 his daughter carolyn gave 
2000 his son michael gave 4050 and his father oscar 
gildenhorn gave 5750 
that brings the total contributions made by gildenhorn and his 
family to the gop to 22966997 since 1984 
gildenhorn gave 50000 during the period to the republican 
national committee or to the republican eagles 
he gave 2500 in 1985 and 5000 in 1986 to the fund for the 
american future a bush political action committee and contributed 
the legal limit of 1000 to the bush campaign in 1987 
gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to republican 
congressional candidates included were gifts to the campaigns of 
sens rudy boschwitz rminn bill cohen rmaine pete domenici 
rnm arlen specter rpa john warner rva orrin hatch 
rutah bob kasten rwis and former sen paula hawkins rfla 
gildenhorn 59 is a senior partner in brown gildenhorn and 
jacobs a law firm specializing in real estate he is also president 
of the jbg real estate associates and jbg properties inc 
gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the 
sovran bank here he is a graduate of the university of maryland and 
yale university law school 
other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the american 
academy of diplomacy include florida real estate developer joseph 
zappala nominated as ambassador to spain melvin l sembler a real 
estate executive in florida named to be ambassador to australia and 
della m newman a seattle wash real estate broker named to be 
ambassador to new zealand 
no action has been taken by the senate on any of those 
nominations 
according to sen paul sarbanes dmd who first raised the 
issue of political contributions zappala and sembler each 
contributed more than 100000 to republican candidates and causes 
mrs newman served as chairman of the washington state bush for 
president committee 
ambassador david popper president of the academy of diplomacy 
declined to confirm that gildenhorn and the other three nominees had 
been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors 
but he said the academy does offer such ratings making its 
judgments based on a comparison of the nominees biography and the 
requirements of the job 
he said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political 
appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be 
qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the united states 
abroad with dignity respect and ability 
twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by bush in the first 
six months of his administration have gone to nonprofessionals 
many of them large contributors to republican causes committee 
sources said 
sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps 
with amateurs rewarded for purely political services 
political throwaways sarbanes calls them 
i think the time has come very frankly to get off the money 
merrygoround and ask some very difficult questions essentially 
about when extensive political contributions are going to be a 
sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination sarbanes 
told the committee last month 
its not true in every instance but in most of these cases you 
seem to have to be over the 100000 mark in order to make the 
consideration list sarbanes said 
sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such 
noting that many of them compiled distinguished records 
it is not the political ambassadors that are the problem 
sarbanes said it is ambassadors without qualifications

an estimated 50000 people poured into the 
city of canals saturday for a free concert by the rock group pink 
floyd set to perform on a floating stage near st marks square 
by early saturday morning 12 hours before the concert was 
scheduled to begin alleyways were packed and police were trying to 
regulate the flow of people in this city of 83000 
the situation was exacerbated by a 24hour transport strike that 
caused chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike an emergency 
service linking up the islands however was in operation 
the rail authorities issued a strong warning telling people to 
stay away from venice with the influx of rock fans exceeding all 
predictions 
many people spent friday night sleeping outside the rail station 
or near st marks square on saturday the square was transformed 
into a kind of sunbathing area as young people wearing bikinis and 
swimming shorts took advantage of the sunshine while waiting for 
the concert to begin 
the concert was surrounded by controversy from the outset with 
residents and officials concerned that the loud music could damage 
the citys historic buildings 
permission to go ahead with concert was only given thursday after 
the british group agreed to keep the volume down and organizers 
agreed to move the floating stage farther from st marks square 
than originally planned

in a heavyhanded attempt to exert communist 
control over a hong kong newspaper china on saturday fired the 
publisher of a probeijing paper that had criticized the crackdown 
on studentled demonstrators in beijing 
the publisher of the chinesebacked wen wei po newspaper lee 
tzechung called the dismissal illegal and said he would fight 
to stay at the post 
the communist government acting through its official xinhua news 
agency replaced lee with chen bojian a former xinhua executive who 
had been working at the paper about two years 
a day earlier lee had tried to fire chen for his attempts to 
stop the paper from criticizing the june 34 military assault on the 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
a source close to the 78yearold lee said he planned to go to 
court to challenge the action 
zhang junsheng vicedirector of xinhua in hong kong announced 
lees dismissal after an allnight meeting of the papers editorial 
board which lee did not attend 
he said lees firing was legal because wen wei po was backed by 
chinese investment and therefore xinhua had the right to manage 
the newspaper china gives the paper an estimated 13 million a 
year and chinese companies hold the bulk of its stock 
zhang cited a 4yearold resignation letter written by lee as 
evidence of the legality of the dismissal 
now we have decided to accept his resignation he said 
lees dismissal marks the latest in a series of attempts by 
beijing to reassert its control over leftwing publications in hong 
kong and extend the current ideological campaign to this british 
colony which reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
after the military crackdown in beijing china lost all support 
from chineselanguage magazines and papers in hong kong 
lees newspaper changed its masthead from red to black in 
mourning 
today i cant be an accomplice to the murderers anymore lee 
said in a television interview after the military assault 
the statement marked the first time since the paper was founded 
in 1948 that it had broken with the communist party 
support from the hong kong media is important for china because 
many hong kong papers set the tone for public opinion in chinese 
communities worldwide many also are smuggled into china 
since the crackdown began chinese officials have repeatedly told 
hong kong residents not to interfere in chinas domestic affairs 
by publishing critical accounts of the crackdown or helping the 
movement for democratic reforms 
wen wei po continued to refer to chinese leaders deng xiaoping 
and li peng as a gang of thieves lee had also reportedly been 
exploring a plan to allow the paper to become independent from 
communist control 
a group of american chinese have formed an organization friends 
of the wen wei po to raise funds for the paper 
on thursday lee and chen battled over an article on the group 
chen won out as wen wei po published a report criticizing the 
organization 
in his statement lee blasted chens story calling it nothing 
but wanton insults 
several editors of hong kong publications said xinhuas actions 
were disturbing because they constituted an infringement on a free 
press 
hong kong will return to chinese rule in 1997 and china has 
promised to keep the colonys freewheeling social and capitalist 
economic system intact for 50 years 
but this type of action shows that its all a farce said lee 
yi publisher of the nineties an influential chineselanguage 
magazine we have a choice either report the news or become 
beijings mouthpiece those of us who report the news had best get 
out of town

a strike by french air traffic control technicians 
disrupted flight schedules saturday throughout much of western 
europe causing delays of up to 10 hours on some flights officials 
said 
civil aviation officials at orly airport in paris said the strike 
by technicians who maintain radars and other electronic equipment 
used for takeoffs and landings was scheduled to last until monday 
it began tuesday 
controllers were ordered to increase spacing between flights as a 
safety measure 
the domestic airline air inter predicted delays on about 30 of 
its 240 flights saturday and the backups disrupted flights 
elsewhere in europe 
the technicians are seeking increased staffing and changes in 
career promotion ladders to match those of air traffic controllers 
the transport ministry said technicians should be satisfied with 
results of negotiations in october which it said resulted in an 
agreement giving them advantages comparable to those of the other 
categories of air traffic control employees 
in london the civil aviation authority said french controllers 
had cut the number of british flights handled from 54 to a half 
dozen per hour and british air traffic controllers were offering to 
reroute some flights 
the dispute delayed british flights to spain portugal and north 
africa by up to 5 hours flights to and from italy also were 
affected 
the spanish flag carrier iberia canceled 16 flights to and from 
european countries and flights out of the resort island of palma 
were delayed up to 10 hours said a spanish air official 
the french transport ministry issued a statement saying maximal 
conditions of safety are still being fulfilled even though 
controllers were not able to use some equipment normally used to 
track flights

to friends and acquaintances lobbyist craig j 
spence was an enigma they couldnt figure out whether he was a 
character out of a james bond movie or a businessman living a walter 
mitty fantasy 
those who attended spences starstudded parties or accepted his 
money said they viewed his peculiarities like traveling with a 
gaggle of security guards and communicating by walkietalkie as 
the props of a man on the move washingtonstyle 
he looked like a riverboat gambler he was a bachelor and very 
wealthy and always looking for business but that seemed like such a 
common thing in washington said former ambassador robert neumann 
spence once arranged for neumann who was ambassador to saudi 
arabia and several other countries to travel on an expensespaid 
trip with his wife to japan 
the 48yearold spence is the most prominent of several men 
identified in the investigation of a washington callboy ring 
the washington times citing credit card records reported late 
last month that spence had paid as much as 20000 in a month to a 
male prostitution ring that was raided earlier this year by police 
the paper quoted unidentified male prostitutes and others as saying 
spence had bugged his own house where the lobbyist threw lavish 
parties for the washington elite 
since then spence seems to be just about the only person in 
washington who isnt talking about the story repeated telephone 
calls to his home have gone unanswered 
the mysterious spence cut a wide social and business swath 
through washington and the breadth of his circle of acquaintances 
made the story all the more titillating everyone is reading the 
washington times to find out whose name pops up next said prominent 
political consultant vic kamber 
according to the times police obtained credit card slips 
implicating spence as well as many lesserknown washingtonians in 
raids on socalled escort services with names such as dream boys 
and man to man 
us attorney jay stephens says he is investigating the 
prostitution ring which operated out of a twostory brick house in 
a prosperous neighborhood for possible credit card fraud a 
whitecollar crime that falls under the purview of the secret 
service 
the secret service which is charged with guarding the white 
house and protecting foreign embassies also is examining whether 
one of its uniformed guards violated policy by giving spence and 
several friends a latenight white house tour on july 3 1988 
officer reginald degueldre a former white house guard has been 
placed on administrative leave he acknowledged in an interview with 
the associated press that he led a spence group on a private tour of 
the white house just like i did my family he also told the 
times that spence gave him an 8000 gold rolex watch 
the baltimore sun citing anonymous sources reported in 
saturdays editions that a separate apartment spence rented was 
searched by secret service officers the night after degueldres home 
was searched 
richard adams a secret service spokesman refused to confirm or 
deny that spences apartment had been searched when contacted 
saturday by the associated press 
the washington times contends the call boy rings clients 
included key officials of the reagan and bush administrations 
it has identified several midlevel officials by name 
paul balach resigned as a political personnel aide to labor 
secretary elizabeth dole when the story appeared charles k 
dutcher a former associate personnel officer at the reagan white 
house told the times he used the service once paying 155 for one 
session with a male prostitute 
the newspaper also named stanley tapscott another former reagan 
personnel officer tapscott who had become a times editor resigned 
from the paper but denied patronizing the ring 
but it is spence who did not hold public office who has 
attracted most of the attention what has emerged about him in 
recent days is a picture of a man who propelled himself into the 
social limelight by spending money often supplied by japanese 
interests to cultivate academics ambassadors journalists members 
of congress military officers and other habitues of the corridors 
of power 
among those who attended spences gatherings were journalists 
eric severeid and liz trotta james lilley the us ambassador to 
china william safire a columnist for the new york times and 
former cia director william casey according to other guests and the 
times 
much of the money that oiled spences social machine came from 
japan according to records he filed under the foreign agents 
registration act for example in a fivemonth period in 1981 the 
policy study group of tokyo gave spence 110000 the nonprofit 
group was financed by japanese business interests and affiliated 
with a faction of japans ruling liberal democratic party 
some of those who accepted spences hospitality said they did so 
because they believed he could open doors to lucrative markets in 
the orient 
he was eccentric but he was extremely wellinformed said 
former us attorney joseph digenova now a private attorney who 
once went on a business trip to japan with spence 
it was sort of a salon he was running there said veteran 
journalist sarah mcclendon who said spence paid her 400 to write a 
profile of a political figure mcclendon said she refused to do any 
more work for spence when she learned he was being paid by the 
japanese 
obviously the japanese were using him to get as much 
information as they could about the personal habits of public 
officials mcclendon said to my notion that borders on 
espionage 
spence ceased operating as an agent for japan in late 1987 
documents show and recently he seemed to have lowered his profile 
neumann said he attended a small dinner party spence hosted a few 
months ago but unlike previous spence soirees there was no 
special guest 
richard gordon a georgetown university law professor who 
considers spence a friend said spence had been sick but the nature 
of his illness was not revealed 
some of spences onetime associates say they are aghast at 
stories about his alleged double life 
gordon said he has been shocked and utterly repelled by what 
hes read about spence he said spences glittering parties and 
highbrow seminars had zero to do with this sex thing 
gordon said spence seemed to enjoy portraying himself as a 
character shrouded in mystery with spence there was always this 
invited suspicion that he was really an agent he seemed to enjoy 
that he said 
he was a tremendous namedropper and had a tremendous ego 
said kamber who was paid 400 for speaking at one of the seminars 
that spence arranged on political and economic issues 
kamber well known in democratic circles said he assumed spence 
courted him because he provided a counterpoint to conservative 
speakers before he was hired to speak at spences seminars kamber 
said he was looked over by spence at a private luncheon 
i guess he wanted to see if i had the social graces if i 
knew how to use a knife and fork kamber said 
while the spence story has titillated the nations capital it 
has not amused the organized gay and lesbian community 
the washington times story is a rank attempt to sensationalize 
a fact that should come as no surprise to anybody that there are 
gay people in the republican party and in this republican 
administration said the national gay and lesbian task force

since amal and hezbollah began fighting in beirut and south lebanon 
last april for dominance of lebanons 12 million shiites 
the police spokesman said syrian howitzers deployed in moslem 
west beirut shelled a 28mile stretch of the christian coastline 
north of beirut and key positions manned by aouns army in the 
mountains overlooking beirut 
he said shells fell around the ports of jounieh and byblos and 
the christian towns of hadath and kfar sheema on the southeastern 
edge of the wardivided capital 
smoke billowed from the wooded slopes that overlook beirut as the 
sound of exploding shells echoed across the battered city 
aouns gunners responded by shelling the syrian batteries along 
the main seaside boulevard in west beirut and syrian positions in 
the druse moslem villages of shweifat and aitat the spokesman said 
the syrians shell the coastline north of beirut daily to enforce 
a blockade of christian ports and prevent aoun from receiving 
shipments of war material and other supplies 
the blockade has caused a serious fuel shortage in the christian 
sector where some 1 million people are trapped 
the electricity authority said it will continue to provide power 
to water pumping stations hospitals and communications centers for 
two hours a day 
the fighting between the syrians and aouns forces broke out 
march 8 two days after aoun blockaded illegal ports run by 
syrianbacked moslem militias south of beirut 
he charged that the militia ports robbed the badly depleted state 
treasury of about 100 million a year in lost customs fees 
the syrians who back moslems demanding an equal share of power 
with the traditionally dominant christians responded by besieging 
the christian enclave

the number of pigeons in this gambling capital 
will likely decrease soon but it has nothing to do with changing 
casino odds 
the nevada department of wildlife has introduced four 
pigeoneating peregrine falcons in the urban jungle roosting 
comfortably on the top of the las vegas hilton hotelcasino 
the endangered birds of prey now about 40 days old were hatched 
in reno and flown to las vegas where they took up residence 300 feet 
above the ground on july 5 
it might sound like some silly publicity stunt but actually 
the hilton is a tremendous manmade cliff that very much resembles 
what might be found in a natural environment for these birds 
wildlife department spokesman geoff schneider said friday 
a second advantage is theres lots of prey around domestic 
pigeons grackles birds with long tails and there are no real 
predators to eat them theyve even got overhangs for shade on the 
building 
we want to do this every year until we have a pair that will 
come back to nest there schneider said were trying everything 
to save this species which is making a comeback after almost 
becoming extinct 
the hotel built a box on its roof to serve as a home for the 
birds and installed video cameraas so guests below can watch the 
falcons on their inroom television sets

the glamorous and grimy private eye of 
detective novels and mystery movies doesnt exist according to an 
organization of investigators who say theyre no sam spades or jim 
rockfords 
the private investigator has always had the image of a 
carefree devilmaycare individual someone who sometimes skirts 
the law said alan crowe an investigator from portland ore 
but that image doesnt stick to a private eyes trenchcoat or 
whatever kind of coat they wear chasing down the mundane details 
they say make up the bulk of their work 
people think were a bunch of expolice officers said kitty 
robinson an investigator from haddonfield nj with a brush 
cut a pot belly a doubleknit polyester suit with two rows of 
white stripes in a green background and chafe marks under the left 
arm to show people weve been wearing a gun 
robinson and crowe are among 225 members of the national 
convention of legal investigators meeting this weekend in 
philadelphia to network attend seminars and conduct testing for a 
continuing program of certification 
a private investigator is an average person whos a 
professional robinson said more likely than not theyre the 
cerebral type look around this could be a group of computer people 
or sales people 
most of their work is too tedious to make a bestseller the 
investigators said 
its not glamourous robinson said you get dirty you work 
long hours its tedious you actually have to read volumes and 
volumes of depositions

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said in a 
letter saturday to the economic summit in paris that his policy of 
perestroika or restructuring is linked closely to the soviet 
unions participation in the world economy 
gorbachev said the worlds other countries clearly have a stake 
in the soviet reforms 
it is obvious that the rest of the world can only gain by the 
opening to the world economy of a market such as that of the soviet 
union gorbachev wrote in a letter to french president francois 
mitterrand 
mitterrand is presiding over the 15th annual economic summit of 
the wests seven richest industrial democracies 
our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward 
full and entire participation in the world economy gorbachev 
wrote 
gorbachev has instituted a broad array of economic and social 
reforms since taking power in march 1985 however his reform 
movement has done more to improve personal freedom for the soviets 
than to achieve any visible change in economic performance 
the soviet president said the traditional way for resolving 
economic imbalances between states was on the basis of strictly 
national interests 
however today such a balance would be precarious if one tried 
to base it on anything other than the universal interests of 
humanity gorbachev wrote in the letter made available to the 
press by mitterrands spokesman hubert vedrine 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said bush and the 
other leaders had not had a chance to analyze the letter in any 
detail except to say we generally found it positive and 
supportive 
fitzwater said there was no lengthy discussion of the message 
gorbachev said it is clear that common economic interests can 
serve as the basis for cooperation and the proof of that is the 
increasing number of bilateral agreements between the soviet union 
and western countries 
however multilateral eastwest cooperation on global economic 
problems are manifestly far behind compared to the development of 
bilateral and regional links he said 
this state of things does not seem justified in light of the 
weight of our states in the world economy of the responsibility 
that is ours in the rational and efficient functioning of it for the 
good of all people and the world community in general 
one of the key issues before the threeday summit here involving 
the united states france west german britain canada italy and 
japan is dealing with the 13 trillion in debt built up by the 
third world gorbachev suggested constructive cooperation in 
resolving the problem 
we see points of convergence and complementarity in the 
approaches to global problems in particular the solution to third 
world debt the soviet president said it doesnt matter who 
gets credit for the best initiative 
he said old artificial obstacles between different economic 
systems were being torn down it is urgent he added to get 
together on the methodology and harmonization of the economic 
process 
we are ready to engage in a constructive dialogue on these 
questions the soviet president said 
the important thing he said is to find the beginning of a 
common economic language to proceed to a reciprocal exchange of 
information

a tanker spilled more than 
16 million gallons of oil into the persian gulf and indian ocean 
and has been turned away from three ports since a collision last 
month shipping sources said saturday 
a 60milelong oil slick was heading toward the indian coast 
said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the malteseflagged 32000ton puppy was anchored saturday in 
international waters off khor fakkan and several tugboats were to 
be sent to transfer the oil from the leaking tanks the sources said 
khor fakkan a persian gulf port 200 miles south of abu dhabi 
refused to permit the puppy into port because of the leak 
the june 28 collision occurred in the indian ocean between the 
puppy managed by the genevabased acomarit services maritimes and 
the 24597ton bulk carrier quince managed by a hong kongbased 
firm 
the accident about 700 miles southwest of bombay ruptured two 
cargo tanks aboard the puppy which was on its way from egypt with a 
load of crude oil for singapore 
after the accident bombay refused to let the puppy dock because 
of the leaking oil 
meanwhile the tanker spilled 12 million gallons into the indian 
ocean creating a slick more than 60 miles long and 12 miles wide 
the sources said 
sea currents were pushing the slick toward indias kerala coast 
and it was expected to reach there within 10 days 
the tanker pulled by a tugboat headed for khor fakkan and 
fujairah another united arab emirates port but was told to stay 
off the coast and wait for help 
capt roger saunders fujairahs port director said the tanker 
was diverted to international waters five days ago and anchored 
about 50 miles off khor fakkan 
the delay in the transfer of the oil has increased the 
danger of the oil slick growing one source said a thin oil 
slick was noticed when the stricken vessel anchored five days ago

businessman nestor rapanelli was 
sworn in saturday as the fifth economy minister in 3 months and he 
pledged to complete the austerity program of miguel roig who died 
only six days after taking office 
rapanelli 60 took his oath of office from president carlos 
menem in the same government house room where an allnight wake was 
held for roig whose death of a heart attack friday shook the 
beleaguered south american nation 
the new minister said he would continue the policies of roig 
in an effort to halt hyperinflation end argentinas worst recession 
in 173 years and stop the widespread hunger that produced food riots 
in may 
a voluntary price accord with businesses that would allow the 
government to coordinate wage increases will be signed on monday 
or tuesday rapanelli told reporters 
roig 68 had been negotiating the agreement at the time of his 
death 
in choosing rapanelli menem turned again to the giant bunge and 
born grain conglomerate where the new minister served as vice 
president as had roig until his retirement three years ago 
rapanelli is the right man to maintain our economic program 
said menem as he joined roigs family friends and other officials 
at the wake 
rapanelli has worked for bunge and born for 39 years he also is 
vice president of the institute for executive development in 
argentina and is a director of the foundation for latin american 
economic investigation 
he faces a formidable task in continuing the program outlined by 
roig who was sworn in july 8 following menems inauguration 
roig on sunday announced a 54 percent devaluation of the austral 
and raised statecontrolled utility prices by at least 200 percent 
the currency held firm against the dollar which argentines use 
as a hedge against inflation during the first three days of the 
week 
but on thursday the dollars value on the black market soared 
above 700 australs compared to the official rate of 650 following 
a series of rumors including one that roig might resign 
inflation grew by 1145 percent in june and projections for july 
are 200 percent or more unemployment stands at about 10 percent 
real wages have shrunk by an estimated 60 percent 
the economic crisis led to food riots in late may that claimed at 
least 14 lives 
thousands of argentines now receive daily meals at soup kitchens 
that were set up last month menem has estimated that 9 million of 
the countrys 30 million inhabitants are living at the edge of 
misery 
on saturday the government sent 140 tons of food to the northern 
provinces of chaco and tucuman for distribution among the needy 
rapanelli is the nations fifth economy minister since march 31 
the day juan sourrouille resigned after failing to stabilize the 
economy 
two other ministers juan carlos pugliese and then jesus 
rodriguez also failed to implement economic reforms under former 
president raul alfonsin whose radical civic union lost the may 14 
elections to menems peronist party 
roig was not a peronist nor is rapanelli and his appointment 
added substance to menems claims that his administration would be 
nonpartisan 
roig described by associates as a sevenpackaday cigarette 
smoker is survived by his wife two sons and four grandchildren

the government has banned the sale 
of milk and meat products from farms near two large waste 
incinerators after foodstuffs from the farms were found to be 
contaminated by dioxin 
the decision was announced in a letter to parliament late friday 
and followed tests showing that the milk contained three times the 
amount of dioxin considered normal according to george dankmeyer a 
heath ministry spokesman 
the official described the measures as precautionary and said 
there was no immediate danger to public health 
however dankmeyer added that consumers drinking the contaminated 
milk on a daily basis would ultimately take in more dioxin than is 
considered safe he said 
the government also ordered the waste furnaces to take stricter 
antipollution measures and was considering suing them for damages 
he said 
dioxin is a highly toxic chemical contaminant that can be 
released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of waste combustion it 
has been used in chemical warfare 
at issue is the milk and meat produce of 16 dairy farms 
surrounding the rijnmond waste disposal center near rotterdam the 
nations largest combustion furnace for domestic waste 
the annual milk output of those farms is about 1 million gallons 
but there was no immediate word how much of the tainted milk had 
been sold or over what period 
the government announced similar measures for farms in the area 
of a waste furnace near amsterdam after theoretical calculations 
showed the same level of dioxin pollution was likely there 
dankmeyer said 
tests on produce from the amsterdam site still need to be 
completed he said adding that 10 similar combustion furnaces 
elsewhere in the country were believed safe 
milk from the two sites will be taken to a specially designated 
dairy factory where the milkfat in which dioxin accumulates will 
be skimmed off and destroyed the remainder will be converted into 
powdered milk dankmeyer said 
meat originating from any of the stricken farms will also be 
destroyed said dankmeyer adding that farmers will be fully 
compensated

slung with id tags and touting lenses worth more 
than the per capita income of poorer countries 6000 journalists 
descended on paris to report on the summit of the worlds seven 
richest nations and revel in the glamour of the french bicentennial 
celebrations 
the summit and the media circus moved into the barelycompleted 
arche de la defense the glittering 35story cube that crowns the la 
defense business district on paris western edge 
camera crews relished the panorama from the 54step climb to the 
marble base of the arche a structure that forced writers to dust 
off their architectural vocabulary the consensus settled on 
postmodernist 
closemouthed about the cost the french have splashed out the 
hospitality for the more than 30 heads of state and the journalists 
who traced their every move open bars and four 500seat tented 
pavillions at the arche offered 23000 lavish meals to ravenous 
reporters during the summit weekend 
the timing of the summit after president bushs eastern 
european tour and the bicentennial festivities have brought out 
the media stars 
abcs peter jennings cbss dan rather and nbcs tom brokaw all 
broadcast from famous parisian sites 
the festivities and the summit stretched logistics organizers to 
the limit 
each time we try to do smarter and better with less people 
says lloyd siegel of nbc which has a team of about 50 on the 
mission like other media organizations nbc has added staff but 
mainly to handle the bicentennial side or the economic issues 
the military parades dance extravaganzas and the fireworks 
bursting over the summer crowds have provided a colorful finish to 
bushs headlinegrabbing swing through poland and hungary 
abc network originated its business world show from here 
abcs good morning america also broadcast a special on the 
bicentennial from notre dame cathedral while nbc originated today 
from the quai de tournelle 
each of the three major networks lined up top bush adminstration 
officials for its sunday morning talk shows secretary of state 
james a baker iii on abc national security adviser brent scowcroft 
on cbs and white house chief of staff john sununu on nbc 
for a crew from japan broadcasting corporation the two events 
complement each other 
what president francois mitterrand was trying to do involving 
the summit in the bicentennial makes it more festive said takemi 
shiga but i think if the summit was not held in paris the 
bicentennial would not be so much reported 
some reporters grumbled about the readiness of the french for the 
media hordes 
crews cited delayed accreditation the halffinished state of the 
arche which lead to power cuts and communications problems the 
endless security checks and the travel arrangements between assorted 
press centers and hotels 
reporters traveling in the us presidential motorcade got 
separated from the bush limousine more than once while other groups 
followed the president for sevenhour stretches without even seeing 
him 
but the white house press room esconced in the meridien hotel 
has allowed journalists from other countries and nonus agencies 
to join expanded travel pools 
the problems we have had here are unavoidable said a french 
journalist who did not want to be named things would be simpler 
for foreigners who spoke even a few words of french

the most constant complaint during the bicentennial celebrations 
has come from citizens on wheels prohibited for security reasons 
from driving or even parking their cars in much of central paris 
the french revolution was for the abolition of privileges 
grumbled one taxi driver angered by the inconvenience caused by more 
than two dozen visiting foreign leaders 
these heads of state are nice guys and i have nothing against 
them he said but i have the right to make a living 
in typical gallic fashion the taxi driver eager to vent his 
emotions expounded freely on his revolutionary heritage but also 
typical he feared identifying himself by name saying he could lose 
his job if his complaints were made known 
reminded that liberty and the rights of man were at the essence 
of the revolution he gave a knowing wink true but some people 
in this country have more rights than others he said

when britains margaret thatcher and zaires mobutu 
sese seko arrived to view the lavish military parade on the 
champselysees marking frances bicentennial they automatically 
strode up to the front row befitting their place as leaders of 
their countries 
embarrassed french officials had to show them to their seats at 
the back of the bulletproof stand 
the seating order the officials explained was dictated by 
protocol 
but how that magic formula is determined remains a mystery 
the summit of the worlds seven richest nations the simultaneous 
meeting of some two dozen third world leaders and the celebrations 
for the 200th anniversary of the french revolution were all ruled by 
protocol 
a foreign ministry spokesman said saturday the seven were led by 
france the host nation followed in order by the united states 
britain west germany canada ialy and japan the spokesman said 
the order was determined by the years the leader had held his office 
protocol placed president bush barely six months into his term 
ahead of the others because he like mitterrand is a head of state 
and not merely a head of government like mrs thatcher and the rest 
the official could not give any motivation for the order in which 
the leaders of the other 27 countries most of whom went home 
saturday were ranked 
protocol was invented by the french before the french revolution 
as a set of rules for the behavior of diplomats 
as host french president francois mitterrand was able to use 
protocol to get his message across putting emphasis where he felt 
it was due and perhaps putting world leaders such as thatcher in 
their place 
as master of ceremonies mitterrand was able to control events 
from how the heads of government lined up for the official 
photograph to the order in which they made their getaways by 
limousine 
mobutu who was not invited but came anyway is on the french 
governments blacklist for his checkered human rights record 
wearing his trademark leopard skin cap mobutu strode to the 
front row of every meeting only to find he was seated 
inconspicuously at the back 
mrs thatcher was booed by the french public friday for recalling 
the incredible terror of their hallowed revolution and likening 
it to latter day exterminations in communist lands 
mrs thatcher had a place of honor on mitterrands left in the 
formal group photo taken of the seven bush was on his right 
we could not do anything else since she was the only lady 
among the leaders a foreign ministry spokesman explained 
but at the inauguration of the new opera house at the bastille 
mrs thatcher found she had to take a back seat with mobutu while 
bush was in front alongside indias rajiv gandhi and brazils jose 
sarney 
at fridays military parade the british prime minister was among 
the last allowed to leave the bulletproof enclosure encircling the 
leaders japans uno was also in the rear guard 
mitterrand and his motocycle escort left first as is the custom 
for the host 
but the arrangements for the others had not been made clear in 
advance so for several minutes the leaders sat on their red 
velvet chairs not daring to move for fear of what else 
upsetting protocol 
when the order of departure was finally sorted out president 
felix houphouetboigny of the ivory coast a leader of the 
underprivileged countries was first out of the gate followed 
swiftly by bush 
in the confusion the leaders cars got out of order and some 
almost collided president omar bongo of gabon decided to return to 
his hotel on foot 
mitterrand was unable to win approval of his idea for a 
northsouth summit of the nations rich and poor countries 
but he was able to ensure that the leaders of the poor nations 
had plenty of opportunities to mix and mingle with the presidents 
and prime ministers of the mighty seven he threw them together at 
every opportunity

increased the death toll to 23 from clashes between security forces 
and religious demonstrators 
police said 59 people were wounded in fridays clashes in 
somalias capital mogadishu when security forces opened fire on 
what the government termed troublemakers hiding behind the banner 
of religion 
it was unclear what caused the violence 
the government friday gave the death toll as 10 it did not 
explain why the casualty count was increased saturday 
in italy the foreign ministry summoned the ambassador from 
somalia on saturday to express its concern about the lives of 
italians in the country the ministry also said a military plane had 
flown from mogadishu to nairobi on saturday with about 40 italians 
who asked to leave somalia 
residents who spoke by telephone said shots were heard 
periodically around the east african capital saturday but that the 
shooting lacked the intensity of fridays clashes 
the residents who spoke on condition of anonymity said the city 
was otherwise calm and that authorities lifted a 6 pm6 am curfew 
somali president mohamed siad barre in a statement broadcast 
over state radio and monitored in nairobi offered his condolences 
to the relatives of victims and said the clashes were over and

religious demonstrators attacked them with stones knives and sticks 
a resident contacted by telephone friday said it appeared troops 
had opened fire as moslem worshipers left their place of prayer 
islam is the state religion in the overwhelmingly pastoral 
impoverished nation of about 9 million 
friday is normally the moslem sabbath but july 14 also was the 
occasion for feast and celebration of the hajj the moslem 
pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca 
there were reports during the week that several moslem religious 
leaders and other prominent citizens had been detained by 
authorities but it was not known whether the reported arrests were 
related to the clashes 
on july 9 a gunman killed mogadishus roman catholic bishop 
salvatore pietro colombo it was not known whether the disturbances 
were connected to that incident there are an estimated 2000 roman 
catholics in somalia

to visit for more than a year 
since 1981 somalia has battled the somali national movement 
which demands barres removal intensified fighting in the last 18 
months has driven more than 200000 somalis into refugee camps in 
neighboring ethiopia

after a frenzied two weeks to kick off the 
wests wildfire season activity scaled back to a simmer by weeks 
end at the federal boise interagency fire center 
but old hands at the national command post know the slack is only 
a lull between storms a chance to sharpen shovels restock 
supplies and rest before the next onslaught 
hightech sensors to detect lightning strikes offer clues but 
where fires will rage is beyond even the centers experts in 
firefighting tactics manpower allocation weather forecasting and 
logistics 
all we can say for sure is conditions remain hot and dry the 
rest is up to mother nature said spokesman arnold hartigan we 
are far from being out of the fire season yet 
the boise center is the federal governments logistics and 
support nerve center for firefighting activities across north 
america 
there were 33388 fires reported nationwide to the boise center 
through thursday that was well below the 56489 reported through 
july 13 last year when blazes across the northern rockies were 
beginning to spread rapidly through droughtparched brush and timber 
almost 6 million acres were burned last year including more than 
1 million acres of yellowstone national park where flames changed 
the famous landscape for generations federal agencies spent almost 
584 million on firefighting 
this years fires although not as numerous are bigger 
nationwide they had burned almost 130000 acres more through 
thursday than the 11 million acres blackened by the same time in 
1988 
officials say the reasons include large spring blazes in florida 
and the southwest barely accessible terrain and plentiful 
wellcured fuel after a number of years without fires in this 
seasons hot spots 
the 1989 fires also are further south the focus of fire activity 
last summer was wyoming montana idaho oregon and northern 
california this year its arizona new mexico colorado utah and 
southern california 
its where the drought is hartigan said the pattern has 
shifted southwest but id have to say that almost all of the west 
with very few exceptions is still not entirely recovered from four 
years of drought 
as far east as nebraska where the impact of drought is more 
often seen in withering corn fields fire is taking its toll 
but overall the first assault of the 1989 fire season still 
pales in comparison with the memory of 1988 
about 12500 firefighters were in the field at the height of 
activity last week there were about 30000 during the first week of 
september last year including 5600 army and marine troops 
hartigan said the help provided by those crews primarily at 
yellowstone gave fire bosses an extra tool they hope will be 
unnecessary this summer 
what we learned is military troops are physically fit theyre 
disciplined and we can train them to do what we need to do in just a 
couple of days he said were not anticipating the need for 
that but we want to be prepared

mexico test case for the united states new 
strategy to ease the foreign debt problem may clinch a deal shortly 
with bankers to trim its 100 billion loan portfolio a white house 
official said saturday 
it is in the dotting the i and crossing the t stage on some 
of the tough details that are important both of mexico and the 
banks john sununu told reporters 
sununu president bushs chief of staff raised the possibility 
of an agreement by sundays conclusion of the economic summit of the 
seven major industrialized nations in paris 
bush and other officials want an early end to the talks with 
mexico to prove the viability of its new approach on the 13 
trillion debt of developing nations the strategy marking a sharp 
turn in american policy emphasizes debt forgiveness or reduction 
for the poorer nations 
finance ministers taking part in the summit from the united 
states britain canada france germany italy and japan called on 
commercial banks to play their part in the latest debt plan 
we felt the banks should get on with the negotiations said 
canadian finance minister michael wilson we feel the resources 
that are in place are adequate to do the job 
toyoo gyoten deputy japanese finance minister said the main 
thrust was we have to continue to put the wind in the sails of 
bankers and keep it moving 
in supporting the current approach the officials turned aside 
fresh pleas for more help from leaders of poorer nations who were 
in town to mark fridays 200th anniversary of the french revolution 
in their economic talks summit participants were generally 
upbeat about the economic outlook but warned of the threat posed by 
rising inflation in some countries 
theres no recession talk at all said wilson theres no 
country who saw a recession on the horizon or the possibility of a 
recession on the horizon 
but he said inflation is a problem we must continue to deal 
with that we must continue to be vigilant on 
the officials also stressed the importance of correcting the 
budget and trade imbalances run up by some countries 
they urged countries to make sure the current round of trade 
liberalization end on a successful note by their scheduled 1990 
deadline the talks under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade have been hampered by disputes over agricultural 
subsidies and other issues the 96nation gatt is a forum and 
arrangement to promote free world trade 
much of the attention of the economic discussions has been 
focused on mexicos debt negotiations 
mexico is the developing worlds no 2 debtor behind brazil it 
has often taken the lead in finding new ways to ease the debt load 
sununu showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching said 
mexican officials and private bankers are now about that far 
apart 
he said another bargaining session was expected in the next 24 
hours or so and it is hoped that at that meeting substantially most 
of if not all of that gap will be closed 
wilson also said the debt talks were pretty close he said a 
mexican deal could clearly be an incentive to other countries to 
make economic changes required for participation in the rich 
countries debt plan it calls for debtor nations to cut inflation 
rates strengthen their currencies and take other steps to regain 
their economic health 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said friday the united states 
was willing to work with the other industrialized nations to arrange 
a 1 billion to 2 billion emergency loan to help mexico meet its 
obligations while it negotiates with private bankers for a new debt 
accord 
mexico owes private lenders 54 billion with about 15 billion 
due american banks 
in its negotiations with bankers mexico wants to slash both its 
overall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments which 
run about 10 billion a year 
both sides have tentatively agreed on a 35 percent discount that 
would mean savings to mexico of about 3 billion in annual debt 
payments according to sources who demanded anonymity

poland will receive massive shipments of foodstuffs 
in a campaign approved saturday by leaders of the seven wealthiest 
democracies in recognition of warsaws efforts at reform 
officials say the foodlift the first definitive action endorsed 
saturday by the economic summit could start within two weeks the 
leaders of the seven nations also will convene an international 
conference within a few weeks to coordinate aid to hungary and 
poland 
the food aid is the first joint gesture by the worlds wealthiest 
democracies toward a socialist country in response to its reform 
movement though several western nations have already forgiven or 
rescheduled hardcurrency debts to ease warsaws financial burdens 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski had appealed to the paris 
summit leaders to take immediate action to prevent a worsening of 
polands economic crisis and suggested food credits and debt 
rescheduling as ways of lessening the burden 
european nations are currently warehousing surplus stocks of 
meat sugar grain and some dairy products that could ease the 
crisis and diversify the diets of poles afflicted by bad harvests 
and a cumbersome distribution system 
claus ehlermann spokesman for the european economic community 
said officials within his organization took the summit statement on 
food aid for poland as a mandate to take stock of the specific items 
available what is needed by the poles and to determine what other 
governments outside the 12nation community might be willing to 
contribute 
the food aid coordination will move very quickly maybe as soon 
as next week ehlermann said 
asked how long it would take to actually deliver food to poland 
ehlermann said the relief effort could be under way within two 
weeks he pointed out the eecs experience in orchestrating urgent 
aid to ethiopia in past years 
were not sure what volume they have in mind the eec 
spokesman said of the summit initiative 
ehlermann said grain and meat are in good supply in eec surplus 
warehouses but that milk powder and butter were insufficient to 
meet a huge demand 
at the urging of west german chancellor helmut kohl the seven 
leaders included in their political communique the call for urgent 
action to supply poles with foods in chronic shortage there 
at president bushs behest the statement broadened the planned 
effort to concerted effort for reform across the board and the 
conference was opened to all interested countries rather than 
simply the sevennation family of the summit participants 
in my opinion at least since the visit of president bush to 
hungary and poland we see a more positive approach by the seven to 
help these countries help themselves observed west german foreign 
ministry spokesman hanns schumacher there had previously been a 
lot of mistrust of the german position 
bush visited those countries en route to paris and praised the 
warsaw and budapest governments for their efforts toward an improved 
world political climate and protection of human rights

a soldier in sri lanka mistook indian 
peacekeeping troops for rebels and opened fire sparking a gunbattle 
that killed two sri lankan soldiers and two indian soldiers an 
indian government spokesman said saturday 
the clash friday was the first of its kind since indian troops 
were sent to sri lanka nearly two years ago to quell the civil war 
but the spokesman called the gunbattle an accident and said both 
countries considered the matter closed 
the sri lankan soldier fired on an indian patrol of about 20 
soldiers passing a remote jungle camp at 3 am friday setting off 
a brief firefight said the spokesman who commented on condition of 
anonymity 
the shooting occurred near akbopana about 130 miles northeast of 
colombo the sri lankan capital 
relations between the two governments have grown increasingly 
prickly in recent weeks since sri lankan president ranasinghe 
premadasa demanded that india withdraw its peacekeeping force by 
july 29 
the exchange of fire between the two sides lasted for a short 
while it was stopped when the mistake was realized the 
government spokesman said 
it was decided to treat the matter as closed and not to 
publicize it he added 
premadasas government has enforced censorship in sri lanka since 
july 6 
two indian soldiers were killed and five were wounded on the 
sri lankan side two reportedly were killed and a few wounded the 
indian government spokesman said 
another source speaking on condition he was not identified 
further said two sri lankans were confirmed dead 
sri lankan tamil guerrillas who have attacked both sri lankan 
and indian soldiers sometimes wear militarystyle uniforms and have 
been known to travel in stolen military vehicles 
the indian spokesman said the indian soldiers were on foot 
however this seemed unlikely especially at in the dark because 
of the danger of guerrilla ambushes and leopard attacks 
the indian peacekeeping force was dispatched to sri lanka on july 
30 1987 after india and sri lanka signed an accord designed to end 
the war by tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
say they are discriminated against by the sinhalesedominated 
government sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population 
india became involved in the internal affairs of its small 
neighbor because of its role as the regions chief power and the 
political clout of its own tamil minority of 60 million

harmony and reverence for human rights echoed 
saturday from the summit document adopted by leaders of seven 
democracies in a windowless room on the 35th floor of the grand 
arch frances newest national symbol 
on the bicentennial of the french revolution it was only natural 
that president bush and his six partners reaffirmed their commitment 
to freedom and democratic principles even as they pointedly urged 
china to cease its repression of prodemocracy forces 
but facing no immediate threats to their security or their 
economies the summiteers issued a mild communique 
it thundered at terrorists without identifying their supporters 
it skirted the oppressive hunger of the undernourished third 
world 
and it pledged no cold cash for poland and hungary to smooth the 
transition of the two soviet bloc countries to free market economies 
even before the leaders opened their deliberations friday evening 
at a lavish dinner of stuffed lobster and lamb washed down with 
chateau montrose 1918 a tentative us proposal to create a 
clearinghouse for aid to poland and hungary was jettisoned 
at the last minute west german chancellor helmut kohl working 
in tandem with bush won approval for a conference of all 
interested countries later this summer to consider polands urgent 
food problems and concerted support for reform in the two 
countries 
bush paved the way with letters to his summit partners before he 
came to paris for now secretary of state james a baker iii told 
reporters the site agenda and participants in the aidforpoland 
conference have not been determined 
french president francois mitterrand a socialist host presiding 
over a gathering of largely conservative leaders found no support 
for his proposal to set up an international conference with poor 
countries to consider ways to ease their staggering 13 trillion 
debt mitterrand had to abandon the idea 
with some two dozen heads of third world countries here as 
bicentennial guests the communique offered hopeful rhetoric but 
as expected not much else 
the section on china called on the world bank to postpone new 
loans as a way of registering our deep sense of condemnation 
over beijings repressive measures also chinese students 
apprehensive about returning home were assured they could stay 
indefinitely in the united states britain canada france italy 
and west germany 
no sanctions were recommended an apparent ratification of bushs 
policy of taking a measured approach to events in beijing baker 
said the president had taken the lead on the subject at the summit 
we look to the chinese authorities to create conditions which 
will avoid their isolation and provide for a return to cooperation 
based upon the resumption of movement towards political and economic 
reform and openness the communique said with a diplomatic lack of 
directness 
and while the seven leaders encouraged greater freedom and 
democracy in central and eastern europe they evinced no sign of 
fervor or immediate aid to match us incentives of 115 million and 
25 million that bush extended to poland and hungary during his 
visits there 
even so baker was pleased with the overall results he said the 
leaders got along so well they may be able to conclude their 
deliberations ahead of schedule on sunday 
having attended nine summits as white house chief of staff 
treasury secretary and now secretary of state baker said this was 
the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that i 
have attended 
bush after breakfast saturday with british prime minister 
margaret thatcher dismissed the absence of specific aid commitments 
from his summit partners 
there have been some misconceptions we would come in here with 
a dollar package the president said i managed to convey in 
poland that that was not the case and here it is not the case 
he said the communique vindicated his approach 
mrs thatcher said meanwhile we are all very anxious to help 
we are all helping each in our own way

leaders have agreed to hold talks to resolve panamas political 
crisis 
a statement by the mission from the organization of american 
states said the talks were scheduled to begin sunday without an 
agenda without preconditions and with the commitment that no topic 
would be excluded 
the defense forces will send representatives to the talks as part 
of the government delegation the statement said the defense forces 
chief gen manuel antonio noriega is the nations de factor leader 
and is under pressure to quit 
up to now the position of the defense forces and the government 
has been that noriegas situation was not subject to discussion 
saturdays announcement that no topic would be excluded seemed 
to indicate a change of attitude 
it will be the first time that the defense forces government and 
opposition have held talks 
the oas delegation arrived saturday on its third mediation visit 
since noriegas regime annulled an election may 7 that international 
observers say opposition candidates won by a landslide 
ecuadors foreign minister diego cordovez is heading the mission 
which includes foreign ministers mario palencia of guatemala and 
sadeo badseo of trinidadtobago and oas secretarygeneral joao 
baena soares of brazil 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara backed by a 
coalition of his own liberal party the christian democrats and the 
nationalist liberal republican party is demanding noriegas ouster 
and that the government admit it lost the election 
the opposition also accuses noriega of human rights violations 
corruption and press censorship 
noriega has been under pressure from the united states to step 
down since two federal grand juries indicted him in florida in 
february 1988 on drug trafficking and moneylaundering charges 
noriega has accused the united states of trying replace him with 
a docile government that would agree to a continuation of a us 
military presence beyond dec 31 1999 when the panama canal is to 
be turned over to panama

as leaders of the worlds seven richest industrial 
nations huddled saturday to discuss global warming pollution and 
other threats to the planet earth environmentalists challenged them 
to turn their talk into action 
rhetoric is terrific discussions are great but we feel its 
time for specific commitments said rafe pomerance of the world 
resources institute 
the summit leaders have already made the environment a 
cornerstone of their 15th annual economic summit they addressed the 
issue in passing in the political communique issued earlier saturday 
we see good opportunities for the countries of west and east to 
work together to safeguard the resources and the environment 
the leaders declared 
onethird of the final communique was expected to cover the 
environment a reflection of the growing sentiment around the world 
for a solution to the worlds pollution problems 
during their discussions saturday british prime minister 
margaret thatcher told her colleagues no generation has a 
freehold on this earth all we have is a life tenancy with a full 
repairing lease 
a british spokesman who relayed mrs thatchers comments said 
there was general consensus among the summit partners that 
environmental problems should be attacked through existing 
international institutions including the un environmental 
program the world meteorological organization and other un 
agencies on climate changes 
a canadian official said west german chancellor helmut kohl was 
particularly firm in insisting that tropical rain forests be 
given urgent attention 
the official who briefed reporters on condition he not be 
identified said canadian prime minister brian mulroney said the 
communique should express the need for a barometer or yardstick to 
measure the environment costs caused by economic development 
according to the british spokesman who also requested anonymity 
mrs thatcher said the guiding philosophy should be recognition of 
the principle that environmentally senstive development is both 
possible and essential 
the bush administration views the environment as an area in which 
the united states can provide the leadership 
this is the 15th summit of the leaders of the seven countries 
here said william reilly administrator of the us environmental 
protection agency none has ever come close to paying the 
attention to the environment that this one has 
among the items on the table air and water pollution including 
acid rain oil spills and damage to the ozone layer from 
chloroflurocarbons in the upper atmosphere a problem that reilly 
said could lead to the potential destablilization of the planet 
on all of these issues we see that there is an emerging 
consensus on the part of the leaders of the governments represented 
here that these issues are significant important are worthy of 
concern at the very highest levels of government reilly said 
but he said no formal agreement on a course of action was 
expected when the final summit communique is released sunday 
its not the function of governments to come together at 
summits and set out specific measures to reduce for example the 
unemployment rate or the rate of inflation he said 
rather the point of summit conversations is to identify 
problems determine general categories of priority give a degree of 
consensus if that exists identifying sometimes areas of 
disagreement that have to be resolved said reilly that is 
whats happening on the environment 
the final communique is likely to express little beyond a unified 
call among the industrial powers for decisive action by all nations 
as well as a reiteration of concern about depletion of the ozone 
layer ocean pollution dirty urban air and the need for a 
framework agreement that may eventually lead to a multinational 
treaty on global warming 
that isnt enough for environmentalists 
diplomacy is great but its got to run according to the 
atmospheres timetable not political leaders pomerance told 
reporters 
we wish that the united states would come with a proposal to 
make a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the end 
of this century said david gardner legislative director of the 
sierra club 
gardner said it appeared that neither bush nor reilly had 
brought such a proposal to this summit and thats a major 
disappointment to us 
kohl was pushing a proposal to convert third world debt into a 
fund for protection of endangered tropical rain forests but that 
idea has generated a lukewarm response from the united states and 
great britain and appeared to have little chance for success 
japan in a statement of its major contributions to the 
summit outlined its plan to give developing countries 225 billion 
over three years for projects to improve the environment it said it 
will send a mission to eastern europe to determine how to attack the 
problems on a global level

a pilot told investigators saturday he 
didnt know how he was shot and has no recollection of his 800mile 
apparently unconscious flight down the east coast in his small 
plane officials said 
federal investigators talked to thomas root in his hospital room 
for the first time since the lawyer was rescued thursday in bahamian 
waters where his singleengine plane crashed afterward authorities 
learned root had been shot 
root told a federal air safety investigator in a 40minute 
interview that he did not recall the shooting he was interviewed 
separately by an fbi agent 
we have no reason to disbelieve him at this point we have some 
questions there are some inconsistencies said andrew alston of 
the national transportation safety board he doesnt remember a 
gunshot wound and we see one that is a large inconsistency that we 
hope to resolve 
root a gun collector told alston that he kept a loaded 
32caliber smith amp wesson revolver in the glove compartment of his 
plane root said he doesnt remember anything after a radio 
conversation in which he reported having difficulty breathing the 
ntsb investigator said roots plane ran out of gas and crashed 
about four hours later 
his statement to me was indicative of an oxygen deprivation 
situation alston said the next thing he remembered was waking 
up and seeing water coming through and around the windshield 
alston said officials will conduct further tests including 
checking for carbon monoxide in a blood sample and talk to the gun 
manufacturer about possible causes of the shooting 
root was in stable condition at memorial hospital in hollywood 
north of miami he had been under heavy sedation friday 
its an odd story all right roots brotherinlaw brett 
geer said after a visit friday with this wound and him not being 
able to recollect how he got it im sure there is reason for an 
investigation 
even though there are a lot of unanswered questions the one 
thing we are certain of is that he did not make any attempt on his 
life said brother w todd root of burlingame calif 
root underwent surgery at the hospital thursday night 
hes a very lucky guy said dr robert cohen who operated on 
root i dont know if he wanted to be lucky well find out sooner 
or later 
root 36 of alexandria va apparently became unconscious while 
piloting his cessna from washington national airport to rocky mount 
nc 
the plane was on autopilot and military pilots shadowed his 
aircraft for nearly four hours the plane ran out of gas and crashed 
in miledeep waters 14 miles west of the bahamian island of 
eleuthera root swam to a raft where rescuers pulled him to safety 
geer said root told him the bullet wound was not selfinflicted 
and could have occurred when the impact of the crash triggered the 
pistol 
on friday a us customs service official said authorities found 
35 guns many of them loaded in a search of roots plane last april 
at the manassas airport in virginia 
all of the guns were legal under federal law and all but one 
under state law which led to a state misdemeanor charge the 
arsenal included assaultstyle rifles and three 357caliber magnum 
pistols 
in north carolina secretary of state rufus edmisten said his 
office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a 
company with which root acted as an attorney edmisten said the 
lawyer knew he was under investigation

finance ministers of the seven major industrial 
nations agreed saturday to set up an international task force to 
trace laundered drug money 
japanese deputy finance minister toyoo gyoten said the ministers 
expressed grave concern that such laundering eventually will 
really undermine the credibility of the financial systems 
the ministers spoke of the problem during talks organized as part 
of the sevennation paris summit ending sunday 
a british spokesman who asked not to be identified said the 
task force would presumably operate under the aegis of the 
international monetary fund the bank of international settlements 
and the 24nation organization for economic cooperation and 
development 
gyoten told reporters there was a clear understanding an 
agreement that efforts should be strengthened to prevent the 
utilization of banks and other financial institutions for the 
purpose of moneylaundering 
canadian foreign minister joseph clark said the drug problem was 
a dominant topic among the heads of state at dinner friday night and 
lunch saturday 
there is a general sense this is a major international problem 
to which the response is not adequate that there needs to be more 
imagination and effectiveness in devising a more effective response 
both to the demand problem and source problem clark told a news 
conference 
prime minister margaret thatcher outlined at saturdays afternoon 
session her plan to hold an international conference in britain this 
fall on ways of curbing demand for drugs primarily through 
educational programs 
mrs thatcher regards damping down demand as a key complement to 
pressure from industrialized countries on third world nations to 
curb the production of drugs particularly cocaine and crack

about 100 guerrillas from the leftist shining path group attacked 
the morococha mine friday setting off dynamite that destroyed 
mining machinery fuel tanks electrical generators and electronic 
control panels police said 
the mine owned by the state mining company centrominperu 
produces copper lead zinc and silver it is located in the andean 
highlands 70 miles northeast of lima at more than 13000 feet above 
sea level in the department of junin 
police in huancayo junins capital said the guerrillas first 
attacked the police station of morococha with dynamite to prevent 
officers from reaching the mine 
two mine workers who tried to repel the attack on the mine were 
seriously wounded the police said 
centrominperu employs about 17000 miners 3000 of them at the 
morococha mine the company brings in about 300 million a year to 
this impoverished nation

local communist party officials and mine executives 
have joined strikes in the kuzbass coal region of western siberia to 
protest centralized control over the industry soviet newspapers 
reported saturday 
officials from the mining ministry and regional party committees 
appealed to miners in at least nine cities to return to work 
according to dispatches from kuzbass one of the countrys most 
important coalproducing regions 
newspapers described a chaotic situation in kuzbass which is 
about 2560 miles east of moscow 
the situation has developed into a battle by miners and mine 
executives to wrest control from the moscowbased ministry the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossia said the miners want authority to set 
production levels and improve working conditions and such amenities 
as housing schools and food it said 
strike committees have formed in the mines sovietskaya 
rossia reported most of the people in authority have joined them 
that includes many communists trade union representatives and party 
secretaries 
tens of thousands of miners met saturday night with mining 
minister mikhail i shchadov on the central square of prokopevsk 
about 1600 miles east of moscow according to tass and a local mine 
official 
the minister is promising help said yevgeny g koslov an 
assistant mine surveyor in prokopevsk they are having a 
dialogue 
the communist party newspaper socialisticheskaya industria said 
two mining executives who joined the strikes were mikhail i naidov 
head of a group of mines in the town of prokopevsk and ia khamin 
director of the baidayevsky mine in an unidentified town 
independence is just not possible naidov said because 
moscowbased ministries make up to 90 percent of economic decisions 
affecting local enterprises and governments 
they say you just mine the coal and we will guarantee the 
rest socialisticheskaya industria quoted naidov as saying 
but people do not have what they were guaranteed people have 
nothing worthwhile no housing no food no leisure facilities 
said naidov 
this is intolerable it is not the mine but the individual who 
should be the master the essence of the protest is this we want to 
work more effectively he was quoted as saying 
strikes have been spreading throughout kuzbass despite 
settlements reported with miners in two cities osiniki and 
mezhdurechensk where the strikes began monday 
authorities had reported an end to the strike thursday but 
miners then expanded their agenda from economic issues such as 
food housing and health care to broader demands for political 
change 
the government newspaper izvestia however said the strikes 
spread because no one explained to residents of the region that the 
settlement in mezhdurechensk applied to the entire area 
on saturday thousands of miners and their families held protest 
rallies in towns throughout the region newspapers reported 
the crisis was the worst in prokopevsk where production was 
virtually halted socialisticheskaya industria reported 
events in the kuzbass have taken a sharp turn the newspaper 
said although miners returned to work in mezhdurechensk in other 
mining towns in the the situation has sharply intensified 
published reports said miners were striking in nine cities 
including prokopevsk novokuznetsk kisilevsk leninkuznets and 
kemerevo it was not clear where the other strikes were going on 
none of the reports estimated the number of strikers 
an administrator at one of the mines in mezhdurechensk said all 
the miners there had returned to work but he refused to estimate 
the number of mines or miners involved regionwide 
we never had strikes like this before never said the 
administrator who spoke in a telephone interview from moscow and 
refused to give his name 
miners in byelov and anzherosudzhesk continued to work but still 
made demands on authorities the reports said 
the reports said however that strike committees were keeping 
social order 
at their demand sales of liquor were stopped and narcotics 
control points were established along highways pravda reported 
but the communist party newspaper had harsh words for the 
democratic union a small but widespread group of activists who seek 
legalization of multiple political parties 
efforts were made by the socalled democratic union and 
several other informal organizations to spread antisoviet slogans 
but they received a resolute rebuff in two cities the newspaper 
said 
authorities throughout the region tried to talk the miners back 
to work 
democracy means not only rights but also responsibility 
discipline and organization socialisticheskaya industria warned

a sculpture of a nude woman at the 
arkansas arts center is being kept under wraps when children visit 
because the director doesnt want their teenage guides to be 
embarrassed 
townsend wolfe director of the center said he strongly opposes 
censorship but volunteered to drape the work by sculptor john 
deandrea when children under 12 tour the centers rockefeller 
gallery 
these young children come in with parttime teenage leaders 
they might turn around and walk out and never come back again 
said wolfe 
i dont understand the controversy weve got much stronger 
nude pictures hanging currently and have had said wolfe 
an exhibit showing a couple making love was on display 
uneventfully for four months wolfe said he added though three 
months ago i got called up and told that the caller was praying for 
my soul 
with the sculpturecovering some will think those prayers were 
answered wolfe said with a laugh but the decision we reached 
on this particular piece was not that it was provocative but 
because of the younger visitors we have in the summer months 
wolfe said the draping was not a request of any group it was a 
judgmental call i made 
deandrea said thursday from santa cruz calif that he wasnt 
mad about the draping but he wasnt pleased either 
its happened a lot of times he told the arkansas gazette 
i wish they had enough sense not to do it but i guess they dont 
its the same old same old 
the lifesize sculpture shows a woman leaning backward while 
seated on a box it is displayed with a sculpture of a clothed man 
a selfportrait of deandrea 
wolfe said he expected increased interest in the exhibit because 
of news coverage about the draping most notably a frontpage story 
in the gazette headlined nude art clothed in coverup 
the sculpture is part of the goldstrom family collection making a 
threeyear national tour 
a security guard at the arts center jackie martin said he had 
seen some smaller children peeking under the cloth covering 
it distracts them martin said

authorities obtained a court order to search the 
homes of a green river serial killings suspect because they hoped to 
find records detailing aliases he may have used a top police 
commander said 
but what police took wednesday from two spokane residences used 
by william jay stevens ii were 55 cartons and bags of materials 
including 1800 videotapes travel receipts police uniforms more 
than two dozen firearms and about 100 police badges 
police suspected stevens a onetime gonzaga university law 
student who has been jailed since january on unrelated charges of 
using aliases that could not be checked out without obtaining 
records from his house said king county police capt robert c 
evans commander of the green river task force 
that was the only reason we did the search warrant he said 
in an interview in saturday editions of the seattle 
postintelligencer we know he kept a lot of records 
stevens 38 has not been charged in any of the deaths and 
disappearances and denies any involvement in the case but in a 
court document released thursday he was labeled a viable 
suspect in what has been called the nations worst unsolved serial 
killings case 
evans said it would take a month to examine the large amount of 
material taken under search warrant from two spokane homes used by 
stevens one thing was ruled out though he said the items did not 
include any clothing jewelry or other effects from green river 
victims 
police would not comment on the contents of the videotapes found 
in the two residences except to say that at least some of them were 
homemade 
the green river killer named for a stream south of seattle where 
some victims were found has been blamed for the deaths of as many 
as 48 northwest women many of them prostitutes beginning seven 
years ago this month 
evans said the search warrants of the homes were sought because 
stevens attorneys had not allowed their client to talk to police 
we tried not to have to do this evans said we made over a 
dozen efforts to interview him so we wouldnt have to go through 
this process 
but craig beles a lawyer for stevens accused the task force of 
grasping at straws and said his client is concerned hes being 
singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation 
he said stevens is a colorful character but hes no murderer 
in a lengthy affidavit used to obtained a search warrant friends 
of stevens are quoted as saying he believed prostitutes were 
spreading aids wanted to make films of hookers being dismembered 
and told others the killing of green river victims had been filmed 
stevens is jailed in seattle serving a oneyear term for the 
burglary of a police equipment supply store in 1979 and additional 
time for walking away from a workrelease center in 1981 
while police identified stevens several years ago as someone to 
check evans said manhunt a nationally syndicated television 
show broadcast last december about the green river killing prompted 
a phone call directing investigators to gonzaga university 
that led to his arrest in january on the old escape charge he is 
due to be held in that case at least until september authorities 
said 
evans said there was no smoking gun but said an initial 
study of documents found earlier showed that stevens movements 
between 1981 and 1989 sometimes closely paralleled the killings 
a spokeswoman for the womens coalition to stop the green river 
murders a group that has frequently criticized the task forces 
efforts said friday that the searches of stevens homes might be 
nothing more than a police publicity ploy 
i guess were jaded at this point said cookie hunt noting 
the task force has carried out several search warrants in the past 
without producing any arrests

weather forecasts here will have something new 
beginning this week the scorch factor which two local 
physicians hope will remind folks of the dangers of skin cancer 
with a shoeboxsize device on the roof of a baylor university 
medical center building alan menter and chuck phillips can 
calculate how long it will take the suns ultraviolet rays to start 
burning unprotected skin 
the physicians have begun reporting to the national weather 
service ultraviolet readings at 10 am noon and 3 pm along with 
the number of minutes a sunsensitive person can be exposed without 
harm 
one dallas television station will add the roast quotient to its 
evening weather reports starting monday and several other tv and 
radio stations have expressed interest in the index 
similar reports are available through the weather service in 
tucson ariz and atlanta ga phillips said 
were trying to make people aware that there is a sun out there 
that is doing damage to their skin said phillips a medical 
center internist who is switching to dermatology menter a 
dermatologist is medical director of the baylor psoriasis center 
texas has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country 
phillips said 
of course were in the sun belt and in the south you get more 
ultraviolet exposure he said and because of the weather 
people tend to develop more of an outdoor lifestyle so skin cancer 
is a real problem 
he added that certain types of skin cancer can be fatal if not 
treated early and sun damage can also hasten the aging of the skin 
people who stay outside longer than the index suggests usually 
15 to 30 minutes on a sunny or partlycloudy day should cover up 
or apply sun screens phillips said 
he added that weather can fool people they equate heat with 
sunburn so they think august is going to be the peak in 
ultraviolet radiation he said in fact the ultraviolet rays peak 
in june and july then decline steadly to late december when the 
sun is farthest away from the northern hemisphere phillips said

portions of the censored versions of the notebooks which north 
handed over to congress played a role in recently ended senate 
confirmation hearings for donald gregg president bushs 
ambassadorial nominee to south korea gregg was bushs national 
security affairs adviser when he was vice president 
at a june 15 hearing sen alan cranston dcalif and sen john 
kerry dmass focused on a meeting of bush gregg and former cia 
operative felix rodriguez on jan 24 1985 
norths notebooks contain several references to rodriguez the 
week of the jan 24 1985 meeting but norths lawyers blacked out 
most of the detailed notes adjacent to the references to rodriguez 
saying they were irrelevant to congress irancontra inquiries 
i think its absolutely clear that north and rodriguez were 
setting up an illicit contra aid operation the very same week that 
gregg and rodriguez met to discuss felixs desire to help in central 
america cranston said at the hearing kerry said the notebooks 
should be produced in uncensored form 
the bushgreggrodriguez meeting took place as rodriguez prepared 
to leave for el salvador where he ended up assisting norths secret 
resupply operation to the contras at a time when congress had banned 
military aid to the rebel force 
gregg who paved the way with us officials for his longtime 
friend rodriguez to go to el salvador says he didnt know until 
august 1986 that rodriguez was assisting the contras 
gregg says rodriguez mission was to assist the salvadoran air 
force not the contras and that the jan 24 1985 meeting with 
bush didnt touch on the nicaraguan rebels

reseachers have successfully made the first test 
run of the worlds biggest atom smasher a 17mile circular tunnel 
designed to unlock secrets of how the universe took shape 
scientists said saturday 
on friday evening scientists at the european laboratory for 
particle physics outside the capital sent a first beam of particles 
around the new particle accelerator known as the large 
electronpositron collider or lep 
the 790 million machine built underground beneath the 
frenchswiss border is expected to put the european lab ahead of 
us rivals in the search for new discoveries in highenergy 
physics although plans are in the works for a 53mile super 
collider in texas 
carlo rubbia an italian physics professor and nobel laureate who 
heads the lab cheered along with other scientists in the control 
room as instruments showed a positron beam completed its course in 
50 minutes said lab spokesman neil calder said 
a positron is a positively charged antiparticle of an electron 
this simply means that all parts of the machine all the 
magnets are correctly positioned said the spokesman for the lab 
outside geneva known by the french acronym cern 
the collider built over eight years with funding from cerns 14 
member states is the most powerful particle accelerator and the 
largest scientific instrument ever made 
rubbia says it should guarantee europe a dominant position in 
particle physics for many years to come 
the lep will recreate with new sophistication the wild swirl of 
matter just after the socalled big bang the explosion many 
scientists believe created the universe up to 20 billion years ago 
the threemile stanford linear collider at menlo park calif in 
april won the race to produce the first socalled z particles which 
scientists say could have existed naturally for only an instant 
after a big bang 
but the cern machine is expected to produce thousands of z 
particles by september opening a greater scope for discovery 
watching z particles decay into other particles is expected to 
yield new clues to the structure of matter and the development of 
the universe 
rubbia shared the 1984 physics nobel prize with dutch scientist 
simon van der meer for discovering the z particle in an old particle 
accelerator at cern but stronger colliders are needed to make 
enough particles to allow scientists to draw conclusions 
z particles have also been produced at the fermi national 
accelerator laboratory near chicago that fourmile track was the 
biggest accelerator in the world until the new cern machine was 
built

all soviet golf ii submarines which 
carry nuclear weapons will be removed from the baltic sea early 
next year a soviet naval commander was quoted as saying in an 
interview published saturday 
general staff officer alexander rudenko told the dagens nyheter 
daily newspaper that the soviet union also would dislcose whether 
its warships were carrying nuclear weapons if they were invited to a 
swedish port 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev previously had talked of 
scrapping the dated golf ii submarines in the baltic fleet but he 
gave no date 
the submarines which date to the 1960s are 325 feet long each 
carries three missile tubes according to janes fighting ships 
the soviet baltic fleet has six to eight vessels armed with 
intermediaterange missiles 
all soviet nuclear submarines of the golf ii class will be 
removed from the baltic sea at the beginning of next year dagens 
nyheter quoted rudenko as saying now we only wait for the united 
states to show its good intent 
a swedish defense spokeman declined to say if the soviet union 
has other types of nuclear submarines in the baltic he said no 
soviet ship has made a port call in sweden in about 25 years 
nato ships refuse as a matter of policy to say whether they are 
carrying nuclear weapons all the scandinavian countries have 
policies banning nuclear weapons in their ports 
if our aircraft carrier kiev which has nuclear weapons on 
board would be invited by sweden rudenko was quoted as saying 
we would leave the nuclear weapons at home before coming to 
visit 
rudenko was identified by the paper as an officer responsible for 
peace and disarmament issues at the soviet general staff officials 
at the soviet embassy declined to comment or expand on the report 
rudenko was in sweden on friday to participate in a nordic youth 
trip to the soviet naval base in murmansk on the kola peninsula

france brought its glory days to a crescendo 
saturday by saluting its revolutions bicentennial with a storm of 
sound and color over the city many french regard as the capital of 
the world 
a 45minute spray of 170000 rockets over the eiffel tower at 
nightfall followed early morning fireworks 
before a final bouquet of multicolored bursts in the evening 
show jostling crowds gasped at the piece de resistance a 
200footwide fresco of blue and red framing a white outline of a 
ship symbolizing paris blue red and white are the colors of the 
french flag 
on friday night a parade created by advertising maverick 
jeanpaul goude presented a whimsical blend of history folklore 
and the outer limits of french fancy goude described it as two 
hours of controlled madness 
a million people mobbed the milelong champselysees to see the 
florida a amp m university marching band dance the california worm a 
russian ballarina waltz on ice skates with a polar bear and lancers 
fling flowing french tricolors like batons 
bronx drummers flanked a fullsize locomotive banging on 
55gallon steel barrels chinese students wheeled bicycles solemnly 
jingling their bells under a banner reading we will continue 
a reference to the crushed prodemocracy movement in their homeland 
on one gigantic float a conductorwitchdoctor in a tux gyrated 
atop a rolling mountain of pounding african drummers at the summit 
six undulating senegalese women dressed in blue white and red 
gowns depicted a waving french flag 
halfway through singer jessye norman electrified the heart of 
paris with la marseillaise frances national anthem her 
american nationality organizers said highlighted the revolutions 
universal character 
but the crux of a thrilling infuriating weekend the french will 
never forget seemed to be the traditional july 14 morning event 
when france paraded its missiles down the champselysees 
behind glass at the place de la concorde president francois 
mitterrand was flanked by the leaders of 33 nations from five 
continents including six of the richest and some of the poorest 
he sat between george bush president of a superpower and felix 
houphouetboigny of the ivory coast symbol of an empire france 
colonized and by its measure civilized 
bicentennial celebrations and a coinciding group of seven summit 
of industrial nations drove home mitterrands message that france 
sees itself neither as part of the first world nor the third but 
rather of a separate constellation illuminating the way for others 
but not everyone shared official enthusiasm for the french 
revolution or its 1989 commemoration 
many parisians fled town unwilling to fete a violent civil war 
or simply afraid of the crowds some who stayed grumbled bitterly at 
the massive security blanket 
to an old parisian this reminds me of something i have seen 
before but without the swastikas remarked one old parisian 
many saw ironies in the system of privilege that remains 200 
years after the revolution 
only those with invitations or the patience to wait six hours 
along the route got a good look at the parade television coverage 
mostly missed the zany impressionist mood 
thursday nights street dance at the bastille was billed as the 
worlds biggest allnight party in a twist of history officers 
stormed the citizenry to break it up 
british prime minister margaret thatcher had observed on french 
television that human rights originated in ancient greece and were 
affirmed in englands magna carta of 1215 
she called the french revolution a reign of terror that 
contributed little to humanity 
when mrs thatcher appeared among other dignitaries on giant 
screens off the champselysees crowds booed 
but mostly paris was a raucous party people wore silly hats 
bought tricolored underwear and gave little serious thought to 
history books 
the seine flowed thick with champagne corks beer cans and other 
debris of revelry 
the wellconnected had dinner at dawn with ms norman and singer 
grace jones at le palace others simply found the nearest music and 
did anything from funky chicken to foxtrot 
sometimes the mood turned ugly as young toughs threw 
firecrackers at peoples feet or dropped gas bombs into crowds as 
thick as bearnaise sauce 
but many parisians said they had not seen such gaiety color and 
unabashed outpouring of national pride since 1944 when allied 
forces joined french troops in liberating paris 
as the weekend wound down mitterrands chauffeur set out on a 
personal mission to carry frances message across the world he is 
leading a convoy of renault vans to tokyo via moscow 
three bear the names associated with the french revolution since 
1789 liberty equality and brotherhood the fourth is named hope

french president francois mitterrand on saturday 
gave the summit leaders a personal guided tour of his pet project 
12th century ruins discovered beneath the louvre 
after their first full day of talks came to an end under the 
pyramid the avantgarde glass structure that sits in the louvres 
napoleon courtyard mitterand guided his guests from the underground 
meeting site and into the excavated ruins under the museum 
the 8meterhigh moat walls and guard towers are all that remains 
of the castle fortress of french king philippeauguste 
construction of the louvre was begun in the 16th century on top 
of the medieval fortress of which only an 80squaremeter section 
survives 
the relic of medieval paris is dear to mitterrands heart 
officials said because it was only discovered during the 
excavations to build the complex underneath the architecturally 
controversial pyramid 
both mitterrand and his culture minister jack lang were roundly 
criticized for plunking down the gleaming glass pyramid in the 
napoleon courtyard of the austere ushaped louvre the worlds 
largest royal palace and now one of the worlds most famous museums 
mr mitterrand loves this place said evelyne richard a 
spokeswoman for the french president the construction of the 
pyramid began in 1983 and the works were delayed because of this 
find 
while mitterrand led the way down a subterranean boardwalk in the 
dry moat bed frances director of museums michel laclotte 
explained the history of the fortress to west german chancellor 
helmut kohl president george bush and prime ministers margaret 
thatcher of britain suosuke uno of japan ciriaco mita of italy and 
brian mulroney of canada 
mitterrand his guests and their interpreters then crowded into 
a dimly lit antechamber where there is a display of artifacts 
discovered during the excavation 
a cacophony of languages echoed off the concrete walls as the 
translators struggled to keep pace with laclottes explanations and 
the western leaders asked questions 
among the finds were a golden fragment of the crown of the late 
medieval king charles vi 
after the tour mitterrand led his guests into the louvre for 
champagne and hors doeuvres as the setting sun streamed through 
the windows of the palace on the seine the setting for the cocktail 
session was a recently opened gallery of greek and roman statuary 
which the summit leaders toured as they chatted

a misguided cessna 182 turned out to be 
the only show in town for thousands of people gathered for the first 
flight of the b2 stealth bomber saturday the cessna at least got 
off the ground 
brian green a 35yearold schoolteacher from porterville 
apparently got lost over the mojave desert while out for spin with 
his niece and nephew kris and sarah erickson authorities said 
he landed the rented plane on the tarmac of air force plant 42 
just as the stealth bomber was ready to taxi for its maiden flight 
while the children watched aghast security agents swooped in and 
frisked and handcuffed green 
we just got lost said kris 9my uncle was being arrested 
and we were right with him and it was scary 
they flew down to pick me up in agua dulce they made a slight 
detour i guess said the youngsters father steve erickson of 
santa clarita agua dulce is about 10 miles southwest of the air 
base in palmdale which neighbors lancaster 
green received his pilots license three years ago and it was the 
first time he had attempted the flight from tulare airport in 
central california to agua dulce in the southern part of the state 
said erickson who picked up his children at a los angeles county 
sheriffs substation here 
sheriffs lt tom pigott said green was booked for investigation 
of misdemeanor trespassing and was later released on his own 
recognizance 
mr green was very cooperative at the scene and he gave his 
consent for the plane to be searched and nothing unusual or 
subversive was found said pigott who was on the tarmac as part 
of the security force 
as it turned out a low fuel gauge reading prompted officials to 
postpone saturdays planned flight of the b2 disappointing 
thousands of aviation buffs who gathered outside the air base 
the unexpected arrival of the stray cessna played no role in the 
decision to scrub the flight said air force col douglas kennett

credited a moon landing to a congressman convicted of a sex charge 
amusing a crowd of young republicans at the groups national 
convention saturday 
this next thursday july 20th will be an historic date for 
america as america celebrates the 20th anniversary of neil armstrong 
and buz lukens walking on the moon quayle said 
he meant to say edwin buzz aldrin who followed armstrong to 
become the second person to walk on the moon on the apollo 11 
mission 
donald buz lukens a republican congressman from ohio was 
convicted in may of having sex with a 16yearold girl

jail and fined 500 on the misdemeanor charge of contributing to the 
unruliness of a minor he is free on bond pending appeal

president did not correct himself but did exchange glances with his 
wife marilyn who was also on the stage 
gop chairman lee atwater said he decided not to mention the gaffe 
when he spoke to quayle later but the vice president brought it up 
he said buz lukens oooh atwater said grimacing in 
imitation of quayle

new tests confirmed that the crippled tanker 
exxon valdez is leaking crude oil as it sits offshore in rough seas 
but the oil is decomposing the coast guard said saturday 
we do have some very weathered and degraded traces of crude oil 
in the slick said coast guard lt larry solberg theres also 
heavy concentrations of organic components 
microorganisms and plankton made up some of the organic compounds 
found with the crude solberg said more tests are being conducted 
to determine the toxicity of the materials 
exxon officials saturday insisted the releases from the damaged 
tanker were small and posed no environmental threat 
there is no significant pollution there has been no 
significant pollution exxon shipping co president frank iarossi 
said at a joint news briefing held by exxon and the coast guard in 
san diego there is no oil in the water 
the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 in alaska and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound 
the tanker was cleaned and towed 2500 miles to california for 
extensive repairs to its shredded hull it has been barred from 
entering port however because five steel plates that peeled from 
the ships frame during the voyage must be cut off before it can fit 
through the bay channel 
the rough seas saturday apparently tore loose a sixth steel slab 
from the hull framing said coast guard cmdr don montoro 
a state wildlife official disputed iarossis assessment of the 
slick and said state agencies will demand that the vessel be free of 
any discharge before being brought into state waters for repairs 
i dont want any vessel to discharge oil not this one or any 
other said reed smith pollution response officer in san diego 
for the state department of fish and game its harmful to marine 
organisms 
iarossi said exxon would comply with state and federal demands 
and welcomed the new tests 
were going through a process that will hopefully reduce the 
level of concern by the state agencies and the public he said 
its a process that we have to go through i cant come barging 
in here and say i want to bring my ship in 
the new round of tests were ordered after the coast guard and 
state fish and game department arrived at different conclusions 
after analyzing one of the sheens created off the coast of san diego 
wildlife officials concluded the 18milelong slick contained 
traces of petroleum products but the coast guard tests determined 
it consisted of unidentified organic matter and was oilfree 
the discrepancy prompted a second test by the coast guard 
the tests were conducted on samples from the slick spotted near 
the valdez when it arrived off the san diego coast monday 
the ship about 60 miles offshore is still discharging a small 
amount of a bluebrown slick into the water solberg said but it 
has been confined to the immediate area of the ship and dissipated 
rapidly 
meanwhile sea conditions have worsened in the area and the 
valdez crew along with the tugboat towing it were trying to move 
the vessel to a new position to better withstand the 10foot swells 
and sixfoot seas he said 
state attorney general john van de kamp on friday filed a 
precautionary lawsuit friday in san diego superior court which seeks 
to ensure that the tanker remains outside california waters until 
officials are satisfied its free of toxic materials 
although exxon shipping co has shown a willingness to cooperate 
van de kamp said he filed the lawsuit to ensure the existence of 
an enforcement mechanism for whatever agreement we are able to 
reach with exxon 
exxon spokeswoman jan cool declined to comment on the states 
action saying company officials hadnt yet been able to review it

new assurances from israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir on israels commitment to palestinian elections prompted the 
bush administration to cancel a delegation to jerusalem secretary 
of state james a baker iii said saturday 
shamir gave assurances that his commitment had not changed one 
iota baker told reporters at a news briefing 
before that we had some genuine concern frankly that perhaps 
as a result of the action by the likud party they were in a sense 
devaluing their own initiative baker said 
shamirs likud party in a move that disappointed baker and 
senior state department aides two weeks ago adopted a hardline 
stand against yielding any territory or establishing a palestinian 
state on the west bank or in gaza 
baker reacted by mapping plans to send several of his closest 
aides to jerusalem to see if shamir still planned to go ahead with 
the elections in a way approved by the israeli coalition cabinet in 
may 
the move by likud threatened to split the israeli government but 
the coalition subsequently repaired the rift and shamir signaled to 
washington that the may decision stood 
baker who accompanied president bush to the annual sevennation 
economic summit said it still might be useful to send a us 
delegation to jerusalem at some point but not right now because 
prime minister shamir himself has made a number of statements that 
the initiative has not changed one iota 
besides baker said the national unity government there 
appears to be working together very hard to reconfirm their 
commitment to the election process

leaders of the worlds seven richest industrial 
nations striving to project a united front voiced support saturday 
for democracy behind the iron curtain and condemned repression in 
china during a gathering that even attracted the attention of soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
in a surprising development the leader of the soviet union 
called on the summit chiefs to link his countrys economy to their 
own 
the extraordinary appeal became the principal subject of 
discussion at the summit leaders dinner meeting according to 
french spokesman hubert vedrine he called gorbachevs letter 
totally unexpected 
aside from the soviet leaders appeal the economic summit was so 
harmonious the world leaders decided to end their threeday meeting 
several hours earlier than scheduled sunday the first time any of 
the 15 annual gatherings was cut short 
the letter from gorbachev was read to the leaders by french 
president francois mitterrand gorbachev said it is obvious that 
the rest of the world can only gain by the opening to the world 
economy of a market such as that of the soviet union 
he petitioned the west to consider the reforms he is making in 
the communist soviet economy and to let his country play a larger 
role in world economic affairs 
any disputes that did occur among the leaders of the united 
states france west germany japan britain italy and canada were 
either papered over or ignored as the summit nations issued a 
political communique saturday 
the second day of discussions was held on the 35th floor of the 
grand arch an avantgarde marble and glass office building offering 
a spectacular view of paris 
secretary of state james baker in a briefing for reporters 
called his ninth consecutive summit the most harmonious and one of 
the most productive summits that i have attended 
the rich nations were lavish in their encouragement for political 
and economic reforms in poland and hungary but they did not back up 
the kind words with any specific commitment of money 
but bush indicated that he was pleased with the support provided 
by his fellow summit leaders saying the commitments they made had 
vindicated his approach to fostering economic and political 
reforms in the communist east bloc 
bush attended the summit at the end of a historymaking trip to 
poland and hungary where he unveiled a 140 million package of aid 
to the two nations 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said that all of the 
summit nations were very anxious to help we are all helping each 
in our own way 
the annual economic gathering was interspersed between the pomp 
and pageantry of the 200th anniversary of the french revolution 
mitterrand who considers himself a champion of third world causes 
invited more than two dozen leaders of developing countries to rub 
shoulders with the summit seven during the festivities 
but the french president gave up an effort to get his summit 
partners to endorse a call for a northsouth summit between rich and 
poor countries to address the economic plight of poor countries 
the summit will conclude sunday with a round of meetings and the 
issuance of a final communique expected to focus on such issues as 
third world debt and a pledge to clean up global pollution 
at the urging of west german chancellor helmut kohl the document 
on political issues was amended saturday at the last minute to 
include a proposal to convene an emergency meeting within the next 
few weeks to deal with the urgent need for food assistance for 
poland 
officials said the session could be used as the launching pad for 
a massive foodlift to shortageplagued poland 
european nations are currently stockpiling surplus meat sugar 
grain and some dairy products that could be used to ease the 
economic difficulties of the poles 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe briefing reporters 
said that it was envisioned that the conference would organize both 
food and cash contributions for poland but it was unclear just how 
much food aid would be forthcoming 
the leaders also reaffirmed their support for easing polands 39 
billion foreign debt burden but skipped specifics on how much 
relaxation in the repayment schedule they were willing to finance 
on china the seven democracies called on beijing to cease 
action against those who have done no more than claim their 
legitimate rights to democracy and liberty but the leaders stopped 
short of announcing any stiffer sanctions in response to the bloody 
crackdown on dissent 
in his letter to the summit gathering gorbachev called for 
increased eastwest cooperation on economic matters saying such 
links would prove beneficial to both sides 
our perestroika restructuring is inseparable from the policy 
tending toward full and entire participation in the world economy 
wrote gorbachev 
the summit leaders while not responding directly to gorbachevs 
message expressed their approval for easing eastwest tensions but 
said moscow remains a threat to each of us because of a military 
balance that favors the communist bloc 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that the soviet 
letter was read by mitterrand during the leaders afternoon session 
and that the bush administration was generally supportive of 
gorbachevs proposals for greater economic coordination 
the leaders also condemned international terrorism and vowed to 
bring terrorists to justice 
they called for stepped up international efforts to protect 
against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of the bombing 
of pan am flight 103 that killed 270 people in lockerbie scotland 
last december 
in a clear reference to iran and its allies in lebanon the 
leaders called on those holding hostages to release them 
immediately and unconditionally and on those with influence over 
hostagetakers to use it to this end

king hussein of jordan on saturday rejected the 
israeli peace plan for the occupied territories saying it did not 
represent the goals of palestinians 
the plan is obviously as it is totally unacceptable 
hussein said in an interview on channel 4s world this week 
program it denies the palestinians everything they aspire to 
achieve 
i believe that israel must be persuaded to review its position 
and it is the duty of israels friends the world over to save 
israel from israel and save all of us as a result hussein said 
under the plan palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip would elect representatives to negotiate a peace settlement 
with israel

walked to worship 
we knew there were graves down there bruce cooper gill the 
churchs clerk of the works said friday after his discovery at the 
262yearold church where the episcopal church was formed in 1789

describing them as the size of a victorian bedroom slightly larger 
than 10 feet square 
one vault bearing the family names of binney and cox held 10 
cedar caskets some thinned by deterioration making skeletal 
remains visible 
another vault carved with the name of the john waller james 
rector for a month in 1836 contained four or five lead caskets 
no one has been buried since 1949 in a family vault at the 
church which was built between 1727 and 1754 gill said

mormon chapel in la florida 
in the previous attack on july 7 seven assailants interrupted a 
chapel gathering forced the missionary to undress and then fled no 
one was injured church officials later said the attackers may have 
wanted simply to humiliate the missionary 
police said they have made no arrests in either attack 
leftist guerrillas have a history of making such attacks in 
recent years they say the mormon church based in salt lake city 
utah is a force for us imperialism 
in saturdays predawn attack the two men brandished pistols and 
told the watchman celestino gonzalez this is a robbery 
gonzalez said 
however he said they then poured a flammable liquid on the 
wooden chapel which is about 40 feet long and set it on fire

la florida

a judge saturday denied custody of an 18monthold 
girl to the couple accused of paying 1100 and a plane ticket for 
her 
dade circuit judge frederick n barad also denied custody of 
crystal lynn demetro to her maternal grandparents saying they were 
unfit to take care of her and returned the case to juvenile court 
all four contestants for this child are in need of 
psychotherapy they all have personality disorders barad said in 
a ninepage ruling 
judy and richard demetro accused of buying the girl tried to 
gain legal custody of crystal after the state department of health 
and rehabilitative services asked that she be given to her maternal 
grandparents 
the demetros allegedly gave crystals natural mother camara 
heistand a total of 1100 in 100 bills clothing a box of candy 
and a plan ticket and went through an elaborate namechange ruse 
with the mothers cooperation 
in summary the demetros spun a web of deceit and the court 
cannot permit the child to be caught in that web barad said 
im very disappointed and i want my baby back said judy 
demetro wiping away tears and walking away from reporters 
hrs spokesman michael powers said basically it goes back to 
the beginning except in a different arena 
crystals fate now rests with the county juvenile court which 
will determine if she should become a ward of the state and become 
eligible for adoption she will remain in a foster home where she 
has lived since the judge took crystal away from the demetros in 
miami in june 
no one has been excluded as adoptive parents 
the grandparents chad and carol dornsife of south lake tahoe 
calif began a nationwide search for crystal after learning their 
granddaughter had been given up in 1987 
the dornsifes claim the demetros are gypsies and their life style 
is inappropriate for crystal 
simply the dornsifes have not demonstrated that they could 
provide the necessary care attention shelter and a moral 
environment that would be conducive to and serve the best interests 
of crystal the judge said 
the mother doesnt want the child and the father is unknown 
lester langer a miami attorney representing the dornsifes said 
the judges order was incorrect but expected he called the order a 
partial victory because it allows the dornsifes more time to present 
their case for adoption

state and local housing officials in and around 
the nations capital say developers increasingly asserted they had 
connections in the reagan administration that would guarantee scarce 
federal housing funds a published report says 
theyd say if dc needs the units this is the only way to 
get them said alphonso jackson public housing director for the 
district of columbia in 1987 and 1988 
i said i will not put the city manager or the mayor in a 
position to be haunted by this jackson told the washington post 
sundays edition of the post reports that developers seeking 
funds through the department of housing and urban developments 
moderate rehabiltation program often dropped the names of 
highranking government officials like thenassistant secretary for 
housing thomas demery and former interior secretary james watt 
several federal housing programs have been under scrutiny by hud 
the justice department and congress for alleged mismanagement and 
fraud 
it was public knowledge that if you were wired in as a 
republican you got funding jackson told the newspaper 
he said local housing directors the mayors or the city councils 
shouldnt be blamed because they figure they may not be following 
the rules but they are addressing the need 
trudy mcfall marylands communiy development administrator said 
there was no question that the state received funds that had been 
steered 
under the moderate rehabilitation program local housing 
authorities not individual developers were to apply to federal 
funds developers then were to offer competitive proposals for 
project funding 
however mcfall said developer judith siegel correctly told her 
of changes in hud procedures in 1987 that would qualify maryland for 
previously denied funds siegel told her of the changes before hud 
notified the state mcfall said 
mcfall said siegel claimed she received her information from 
demery 
siegel who the newspaper said could not be reached for comment 
has testified before a congressional subcommittee that she paid watt 
300000 in consulting fees for the kingsley park development 
project in essex md both watt and seigel said their actions were 
legal 
the hud inspector general in april issued a highly critical 
report saying top hud officials created a perception of 
favoritism in the moderate rehabilitation program

twenty years after man walked on the 
moon those responsible for that one giant leap for mankind said 
the space program needs another bold challenge to recapture 
americas imagination 
and with americas imagination they said will come the 
financial support needed for a daring project such as landing 
astronauts on mars 
on saturday a soldout crowd of more than 4000 people joined the 
apollo 11 crew neil armstrong edwin buzz aldrin and michael 
collins at the alabama space and rocket center for the first of 
four celebrations around the country to commemorate the lunar 
landing on july 20 1969 
huntsvilles celebration focuses on the role this northern 
alabama city and the wernher von braun rocket team at nasas 
marshall space flight center played in developing the saturn v 
rocket to propel apollo 11 on its journey to the moon 
the celebration was like a hightech rock concert without the 
music lasers bounced off rockets exhibited throughout the center 
sound effects simulated the takeoff of the saturn v rocket to the 
moon and actors portrayed armstrongs and aldrins walk on the 
rugged lunar landscape four days after blasting off from kennedy 
space center 
it climaxed with the apollo 11 crew rising from a cloud of smoke 
20 feet into the air to the front of a giant movie screen showing 
footage of their travels the crew was surrounded by a cacophony of 
fireworks and dozens of dancing laser beams 
aldrin who spent much of his time in huntsville autographing his 
new book men from earth describes the 20th anniversary as 
bittersweet thats because he worries that america will sink 
to secondrate status in space if it continues on its present 
course 
the 59yearold former astronaut said saturday he hoped the 
anniversary would help america set welldefined space objectives 
instead of having each space shuttle flight being an entity into 
itself 
there is an excitement about the past but there is not an 
awareness of where we want to go he said in an interview 
he envisions the united states working with the soviet union and 
japan on space research projects with a goal of developing 
spaceships that will take advantage of planetary movements to 
slingshot between mars and earth on fivemonth cycles 
collins 58 also called for greater direction in the space 
program 
one of these days and i hope its not too long this country 
is going to decide it wants to go to mars he told a gathering of 
engineers who worked on the apollo project 
armstrong 58 told the same group a machine is manmade and 
hence imperfect no one has ever made a perfect machine those of 
you who made the saturn v came about as close as history ever 
recorded 
jack lee director at marshall space flight center in huntsville 
and a former member of the von braun team vividly remembers 
president kennedys seemingly impossible challenge to land a man on 
the moon by the end of the 1960s 
no president has issued an equally bold challenge since then but 
he hopes president bush will in a 20th anniversary speech thursday 
we must continue what wernher von braun and apollo 11 started 
many years ago that is to reach out and touch another world he 
said this time our launching pad is going to be the space 
station 
konrad dannenberg a german rocket scientist who came to america 
with von braun after world war ii and later supervised engineering 
and testing of the saturn rocket said the moon landing was the 
biggest step for mankind that has ever taken place i hope this 
anniversary is the first step toward an even bigger achievement 
ed buckbee director of the space and rocket center a tourist 
attraction focused on space achievements and a former member of von 
brauns staff said he hopes president bush gives us a goal ive 
heard everything from a moon colony to a man on mars with a space 
plane in there 
buckbee said he sees only one way for nasa to recapture americas 
imagination and pocketbook 
its got to be a man on mars landing he said i dont 
think a space station is going to capture american imagination its 
got to be something that puts man and machine against the hazards of 
space

complaints from homosexuals has agreed to allow frequent flier 
credit to be transferred to any companion not just relatives 
members of twas frequent flier program are being notified of the 
new policy in a mailing now under way the new york times reported 
in sundays editions 
the airline had required people who earned free tickets to use 
the tickets themselves or transfer them to relatives in an attempt 
to prevent people from selling or bartering tickets 
the airline was sued in federal court by lawyers from the lambda 
legal defense and education fund in may charging discrimination 
what we have now done is to expand the policy so that virtually 
any frequent flier can travel with any companion of their 
choosing said mark buckstein the airlines general counsel we 
felt our rules had probably been unduly restrictive 
gay groups said twa was the last major airline to drop its 
limiting policy the times reported 
the lawsuit tentatively settled said william l johnson a new 
york lawyer was denied a ticket in july 1988 for his livein 
companion of seven years his lawyer evan wolfson would not 
disclose terms of the settlement airline officials said the 
settlement wasnt final 
when twa was forced to pay attention to what it was doing they 
realized it was bad business and they changed it wolfson said

to meet growing demand for satellite launch 
services a new deal has been struck between two great superpowers 
the soviet union and texas 
a joint venture agreement gives a group of texas entrepreneurs 
exclusive rights to market products and services of the soviet space 
agency glavkosmos in the united states 
the soviets couldnt be nicer you couldnt ask for better 
bunch of partners said buck hightower a founder of the 
houstonbased space commerce corp which is selling everything from 
official glavkosmos tshirts to launch services for us satellite 
companies wanting to hitch a ride on a soviet proton rocket 
during a break from overseeing a crowded tshirt stand at the 
entrance to the ussr pavilion at the paris air show in midjune 
hightower recalled how a group of texas red necks found themselves 
doing business on red square 
we were trying to sell some idle oilfield equipment to the 
soviets hightower said adding that the texas good ol boy 
network led him to arthur dula a houston aerospace attorney and 
former nasa consultant who had broad moscow contacts we got to 
know the neighbors 
glasnost was booming us rocket companies were unable to meet 
american business demand for launch services so we decided to 
engage in a little creative international trade hightower said 
they rang alexandr dunayev head of glavkosmos who thought it 
was a fine idea hightower said the high sheriffs at the us 
state department werent so sure 
dula now president of space commerce wanted the soviet rocket 
to blast off from a us site carrying the first payload two 
communications satellites for hughes aircraft 
the state department said no way 
the texans then decided to launch from the soviet union under 
the reagan administration the state department denied an export 
license to hughes 
under the bush administration the texans have found a more 
receptive state department and they plan to apply for another export 
license soon dula said in a telephone interview from houston this 
past week 
if the license is denied again his texas company will launch the 
soviet rocket from another country such as australia or brazil and 
will haul a payload containing no american parts the fee for a ride 
on the red rocket is about 30 million 
besides tshirts and rockets space commerce also offers a range 
of other soviet space agency services including navigational aids 
and flights aboard the space station mir 
moreover space commerce can write contracts for advertisers who 
want to proclaim their product or service on the side of a soviet 
rocket the soviets disclosed recently that they want to exploit 
commercial opportunities that their space program has created 
including putting ads in space seen by millions of television 
viewers during blastoffs 
in addition space commerce soon plans to conduct tours to soviet 
space facilities never before open to the public american or 
soviet 
tourists will be able to visit the mission control center at 
kaliningrad near moscow or star city where cosmonauts train with 
sidetrips to the bolshoi ballet and the moscow circus 
our feeling is that there must be a place in the world economy 
for the soviet union said hightower who also heads an austin 
property development company 
during the air show last month the space commerce partners did a 
brisk business selling tshirts mostly to american visitors 
approached quietly by a grayhaired man in a business suit 
partner robert r brandes said no sir just tshirts here the 
back part is where theyre selling the rockets

when the tax tide begins rising as it now may 
be public protest seems to be as ineffectual a weapon as a broom 
swishing against another tide the one that comes in from the oceans 
but dont lose heart you cannot afford to you can say no to 
taxes says thomas humbert an economic scholar he already has 
loudly and succinctly 
whether his message delivered to the national economic 
commission has had much of an impact is difficult to say but it 
shouldnt be forgotten because months later his points remain 
meaningful 
humbert a fellow in political economy at the heritage 
foundation a conservative think tank that was influential in the 
reagan administration and still carries clout at the white house 
lists seven reasons for saying no 
tax increases he says hurt economic growth undermine tax 
equity lead to higher government spending endanger international 
competitiveness and invite chaos in financial markets 
moreover he continues the nations budget deficit already is 
shrinking and a balanced budget can still be achieved without 
raising taxes in fact he says economic expansion is the only sure 
way to reduce the deficit 
but tax increases he contends have the opposite impact they 
limit economic growth by undermining the climate for saving and 
investing 
every tax drains money from the private marketplace to 
government programs he points out taxes impose on the private 
sector a complexity of regulations and paperwork they draw 
sustenance from capital formation 
seldom he suggests are taxes just by his reckoning the 
medianincome family of four did not pay a cent of income taxes in 
1948 now their tax bill is almost 2700 increases he says can 
only mean that such families become more dependent on government 
services which of course are financed by taxes 
there is a pernicious aspect at least one to tax increases 
the one chosen by humbert is this increasing tax revenues relieve 
the pressure for budget cuts and usually result in higher spending 
in defense of this claim he cites as evidence a study conducted 
for the joint economic committee of congress which estimated that 
for every dollar of tax increases in postwar america spending was 
raised by 152 
besides he continues a tax increase now constitutes poor 
timing a global economy is developing and that means competition 
for markets among all industrial powers high taxes he suggests 
could make us less competitive 
but you may respond we must close the gap between budget 
expenditures and revenues humberts immediate response is that the 
gap already is growing smaller but important as it is the gap may 
be getting too much attention 
he suggests that our attention is similar to that of eyeing the 
hole rather than the doughnut whats more important than the 
deficit in any one year he says is the accumulation of debt 
in that regard he calls attention to the fact that in 1946 the 
national debt amounted to 120 percent of gross national product and 
almost 50 percent in 1959 today he says the percentage is down to 
43 and falling 
besides he continues a tax increase isnt needed to balance the 
budget in his view a 4 percent growth in federal expenditures and 
continued economic expansion would bring the budget into balance by 
1993 
finally he contends that a tax increase would signal financial 
markets that american policymakers were returning to the days of 
the 1970s when humbert asserts capital formation and investment 
were almost destroyed by the twin forces of inflation and 
taxinduced stagnation 
what is his recipe for success 
a big job sweeping back the tide and sending it the other way 
with tax rate reductions that encourage risktaking for 
entrepreneurs small business people and innovators the people 
who generate the most jobs in our economy

the chicago board of trade says it averted a crisis but the 
exchange faces a chorus of criticism after forcing a selloff of 
soybean futures 
the biggest boos are coming from farmers who ended up on the 
losing end of the dizzying drop in soybean prices precipitated by 
the exchanges emergency order soybeans for july delivery settled 
friday at 703 a bushel 22 cents below the settlement price on 
tuesday before the exchange issued its directive and 63 cents below 
the previous fridays final price 
they feel theyve been betrayed by the exchange said james 
merritt research director for merchants trading co a chicago 
futures brokerage with a large farmer clientele 
some of the board of trades own members many of them pure 
speculators who make their living forecasting the movements of the 
free market also feel cheated by the edict 
regardless of whether the italian concern ferruzzi finanziara spa 
was trying to corner the soybean market critics say directors of 
the exchange should have let the market sort itself out 
but the board of trade says that would have been even more 
troublesome that with too few soybeans of acceptable quality 
available to satisfy outstanding contracts there would have been 
defaults and chaos in the marketplace 
the exchange says it is only doing its governmentauthorized job 
of ensuring order in a market of global importance thereby 
protecting the publics interest a federal judge in chicago agreed 
on thursday by denying ferruzzis bid to block the board of trades 
directive 
if i grant a temporary restraining order in this case and it 
turns out to be a mistake a loss of confidence in the market 
could be a consequence said us district judge james zagel 
an investigation appears to be inevitable and the centuryold 
debate revived by the flap whether agricultural futures markets 
are legitimate marketing tools or gambling casinos will rage on 
thats nothing new for the chicago board of trade the 141year 
history of the worlds oldest and largest futures exchange is strewn 
with scandals squeezes corners and attempts to crush them 
when the dust clears predicts merton miller a university of 
chicago finance professor and an expert on futures markets the 
board of trade will still be standing 
a lot of people may not like it but as the saying goes its 
the only wheel in town he said if youre in the soybean 
business what else are you going to do

wall street analysts are waiting with some 
trepidation for the secondquarter earnings reports due to be issued 
by hundreds of companies over the next few weeks 
the profit figures are expected to provide some of the first 
hardandfast signs of the impact a slowing economy is likely to 
have on businesses bottom lines 
by all the evidence so far the federal reserves efforts to 
restrain economic growth began to take hold in earnest in the 
apriljune period 
investors have had ample chance to brace themselves lately for 
the likelihood that earnings reports arent going to be as 
impressive as they have been over the past couple of years 
to cite a prominent example among the industries whose earnings 
are closely tied to the business cycle auto stocks have been weak 
for some time as it became increasingly apparent that cars and truck 
sales were slumping 
still many observers wonder how well prepared the market which 
hit new highs this past week since the 1987 crash might be for any 
significant and widespread earnings setbacks 
in this cycle stocks may have waited to fall in the face of 
earnings disappointments rather than in anticipation of them 
said edward kerschner at painewebber inc 
the question goes beyond whether results for the second quarter 
itself measure up to expectations 
if profit growth has indeed passed its peak and is starting down 
many analysts will be scrutinizing the current figures to try to 
gauge how much they should revise projections for the third quarter 
and beyond 
we expect that modest disappointments in the cyclical 
industries will evoke major earnings estimate reductions said 
john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc analysts will seize the 
opportunity to get their estimates down at this very convenient 
juncture 
of greatest interest will be the reaction of cyclical stock 
prices connolly added at best they will be neutral compared 
with the general market the other possibility is that they could 
tumble 
such talk didnt deter investors from bidding enthusiastically 
for stocks in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
climbed 6696 to 255482 on top of a 4780point gain the week 
before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 350 to 18506 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market added 
648 to 44890 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 437 at 36812 
volume on the big board averaged 16026 million shares a day up 
from 12586 million a day in the previous week 
corporate earnings reports for the next few quarters may well 
turn out to be a deciding factor in the debate over wall streets 
popular soft landing hypothesis 
believers in this script argue that the federal reserve will be 
able to slow growth and restrain inflation without causing a 
recession and an accompanying slide in business profits but 
skeptics still regard that as a difficult mission 
we think chances are that this soft landing will run into a 
hard rock said suresh bhirud at oppenheimer amp co we were 
hoping wed see 5 percent earnings growth next year but weve had 
to reduce that estimate 
at merrill lynch chief economist donald straszheim still 
projects 5 percent increases in earnings for both this year and 
next but he notes that that will contrast sharply with the gains of 
20 percent and 35 percent recorded in the past two years 
aftertax operating profits adjusted for inventory and 
depreciation considerations are likely to be flat at best over the 
next two years straszheim said slower economic growth is 
squeezing profits

look out europe the debtfinanced megabid craze 
in america has thundered across the atlantic with a vengeance in the 
form of a hostile 21 billion offer for leading conglomerate bat 
industries plc shattering an assumption that the biggest european 
businesses are immune from attack 
regardless of whether anglofrench financier sir james 
goldsmiths investor group succeeds in its offer for the british 
company the bid has rewritten the rules and could incite a spree of 
multbillion dollar deals 
it has sent shivers down the spines of the chief executives of 
many of our companies says philip healey editor of the british 
publication acquisitions monthly 
nonetheless such large takeovers financed with borrowed money 
face considerable obstacles in britain and elsewhere in europe 
where the buying and selling of companies historically has been much 
more conservative and slowmoving than in the united states 
most highprofile american deals have taken the form of a 
leveraged buyout in which a wouldbe buyer puts up almost no cash 
but borrows the purchase price pledging the target companys assets 
as collateral after the deal is completed the new owner sells off 
pieces of the company to repay the debt 
many european investors have doubts about following the us 
buyout trend they are less keen on borrowingly heavily tend to be 
more loyal to companies and are more sensitive about posttakeover 
job losses 
yet said johnathan mervis chief executive of jp mervis ltd 
an acquisitions adviser time has moved on and the opposition is 
not quite as firm as it was 
the announcement last tuesday of the bat bid which nearly rivals 
the record 25 billion purchase of rjr nabisco inc earlier this 
year means that in the british takeover scene the perception has 
been totally changed this has really changed the whole ball game 
healey said in an interview 
if they are going to take pot shots at bat who else is safe 
he said there are very few companies safe 
europes economy already has been influenced by an acceleration 
in takeovers spurred partly by the perception that many companies 
are undervalued particularly since the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
the approach of 1992 when europe becomes a tradebarrier free 
marketplace of 320 million consumers also has played a role in the 
increased number of corporate mergers many company strategists see 
acquisitions as a good way to prepare for an onslaught of 
competition from inside and outside europe 
in addition a generation of postwar entrepreneurs are now 
approaching retirement many are looking for buyers because their 
own children arent interested in running the family business 
britain is europes busiest takeover battlefield the number of 
british deals has quadrupled in the past five years because there 
are more publicly held companies and bidders face fewer corporate 
defenses and regulatory hurdles than in other european countries 
indeed goldsmith chose britain after becoming disenchanted with 
the united states where competition among dealmakers has squeezed 
returns and where the most obvious takeover targets have been 
plucked 
according to acquisitions monthly a record 2241 takeovers of 
british companies worth 376 billion pounds or 613 billion were 
completed last year vs 1937 deals worth 277 billion pounds or 
452 billion in 1987 
prices soared on londons stock exchange this past week on 
expectations that other british corporate giants would become 
targets now that the ground has been broken shares in other 
european bourses also jumped 
many british investment strategists say takeover activity has 
become a strong underpinning for the london market 
a lot of people now are seeing the low value of some of our 
very large and very successful companies healey said 
but others question whether a bonanza for takeover investors is 
imminent in britain 
im not sure that will happen said mervis i think that it 
will all settle down 
analysts doubted the goldsmith group could woo bats largescale 
shareholders with a bid that is 80 percent debtfinanced 
the institutional investors are very hostile to such bids 
healey said 
bat chairman patrick sheehy described the offer as an 
illconceived attempt at destructive financial engineering 
the bidders who also include british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer will have to 
pay a higher price and include some cash to win analysts said 
goldsmith has said he wants to dismantle bat by selling off its 
nontobacco interests which include financial services retailing 
and paper but many europeans fear that breaking up companies can 
worsen europes relatively high unemployment 
will chief executives be more worried about takeovers than 
running their companies said healey he expressed concern that 
takeover paranoia could make corporate bosses change basic strategy 
to the detriment of their companies longterm futures for example 
they might spend or borrow huge sums to repurchase stock instead 
using the money for research and investment 
what might come out later is the political backlash healey 
said is this good for great britain plc 
prime minister margaret thatchers government although a strong 
supporter of free market forces has blocked big takeovers in the 
past including the australian company elders ixl ltds bid for 
liquor company alliedlyons plc 
but one of two rival bids for gateway corp a large supermarket 
operator is expected to succeed 
the british takeover scene has attracted many american 
participants including leveraged buyout leader kohlberg kravis 
roberts and co the takeover strategist firm wasserstein perella 
and co and speculator asher edelman 
in the bat battle the goldsmith group has lined up bankers trust 
co and drexel burnham lambert inc to help finance its offer and 
bat has enlisted goldman sachs and co and shearson lehman hutton 
inc for a defensive response

bat and batman were at the center of two 
multibilliondollar takeover deals that took shape on opposite sides 
of the atlantic one in the city of london and the other in gotham 
city 
overseas a group led by british raider sir james goldsmith made 
a 212 billion debtfinanced hostile foray for bat industries plc 
a conglomerate that owns the swank saks fifth avenue chain and makes 
kool cigarettes 
the offer which affirms the migration of the american big buyout 
to europe would amount to the secondlargest deal in history behind 
the 25 billion debtfinanced takeover of rjr nabisco corp earlier 
this year 
but if the recent history of american hostile takeovers is any 
indication this deal will go the way of all others to court 
thats where the protracted tussle over the future of new 
yorkbased giants time inc paramount communications corp and 
warner communications inc is mired and a judge on friday helped 
clear some of the sludge 
ruling on the side of times friendly 14 billion offer for 
warner the entertainment empire reaping big profits from its 
batman film hit delaware chancery court judge william t allen 
scuttled for now paramounts hostile 122 billion offer for time 
the judge refused to block times 70ashare offer paramount 
though appealed the ruling to the state supreme court in delaware 
where all three companies are incorporated 
in britain bat and its pursuer a trio of powerful investors led 
by goldsmith were lining up attorneys for what promises to be a 
legal extravaganza 
since many bat subsidiaries are american the takeover could be 
decided in us courts earlier this year a federal judge 
effectively ended south africacontrolled minorco sas bid for 
britains consolidated gold fields plc by issuing a retraining order 
against the acquisition 
besides highly paid investment bankers the bat offering would 
bring two other popular american financial tools to europe the use 
of highyield junk bonds and the dismemberment of a large company 
no caped crusader he goldsmith says he wants to bust up bat by 
selling its nontobacco interests which account for about 60 
percent of its annual revenue of 287 billion in america those 
interests include saks marshall field appleton papers and farmers 
group inc one of the nations largest insurers 
while the takeover gulf between europe and the united states 
appears to be narrowing theres no denying the enormous economic 
gap between east and west reflected in the bat and time capers 
as the two deals went their respective routes time in court 
bat heading there president bush was behind the iron curtain 
offering poland 100 million in aid a figure that probably wont 
approach the fees for lawyers and investment bankers in the takeover 
bids

a proposed rule change in an obscure aspect of 
us securities law signals that federal regulators are ready to go 
global 
as the drive toward automated trading and internationally linked 
markets accelerates the securities and exchange commission has 
decided to proceed in a toned down version with a proposal that 
would make it easier for us and foreign corporations to raise 
money through the private sale of securities 
its called rule 144a and although sec officials and industry 
experts concede it wont have much direct effect on the average 
american it has generated an enormous amount of interest in the 
financial community and press 
i used to call it the satanic verses of the securities 
industry said sara hanks an sec official in washington first 
proposed last october rule 144a like the controversial salman 
rushdie novel remained obscure to all but devotees until it was 
publicly attacked and turned into a hot news story we got some 
very inflammatory headlines she said 
supporters said it would lower financing costs for us companies 
while enticing foreign corporations previously discouraged by sec 
registration and disclosure requirements to raise capital here 
but critics claimed the rule change would increase the power of 
large institutional investors like banks and insurance companies 
by eroding the already shrinking public securities markets where 
investors big and small are considered equal 
that private market has mushroomed from 16 billion or nearly 22 
percent of the total securities market in 1980 to about 200 billion 
or almost 43 percent last year according to idd information 
services a firm that tracks trends in the financial industry 
after some etooling following input from the securities industry 
and stock exchange officials the sec voted 50 last week to seek 
additional comment on rule 144a 
the modified version was one of five proposals cleared by the sec 
last week addressing problems raised by the globalization of 
financial markets which has made it easy to trade us stocks in 
singapore and british stocks in new york 
international markets are increasingly automated and 
interlinked sec chairman david s ruder told a senate 
subcommittee hearing on globalization last month 
as dramatically illustrated by the october 1987 market break 
the secs term for the stock market crash events in one countrys 
securities markets may affect those in other countries 
rule 144a if approved by the sec would loosen restraints on the 
trading in the private placement market securities that are 
exempted from sec registration requirements because they are not 
offered publicly 
the attraction to private offerings is as much a question of 
convenience as anything else said geoff vincent an associate at 
idd information services 
paperwork for a public offering takes a minimum of two weeks 
after it gets to the sec he explained while in a private offering 
you cut out the whole formality of registering with the sec there 
has to be some savings on printing expenses and legal costs 
but theres a catch while companies can sell their securities to 
large investors without the lengthy and expensive disclosure and 
registration proceedings required in public offerings the purchaser 
must hold them for two to three years that restriction has made 
privately placed securities unattractive to many large investors 
forcing issuers to sell at a discount 
rule 144a would create a safe harbor from the resale 
restriction 
what were doing here is providing a more liquid market making 
it more efficient so its easier to resell them said ms hanks 
chief of the secs office of international corporate finance 
in response to earlier comments by top officials from major 
corporations and investment institutions the sec staff recommended 
changes in its initial proposal 
they included narrowing the number of institutions allowed to 
participate and barring securities that already are publicly traded 
from the registration exemption 
from what weve read about it we think its better than the 
last rule but whether its something we completely support i cant 
say yet said kenneth leibler president of the american stock 
exchange 
ms hanks noted that the securities act of 1933 which rule 144a 
would modify slightly was aimed at protecting investors 
our role is to protect investors when they need protecting 
she said there was clear intent by congress that there are some 
people who just dont need our protection the large institutional 
investors who can fend for themselves 
gene finn chief economist for the national association of 
securities dealers which oversees overthecounter stock dealers 
agreed that large institutions dont need the protections built 
into many sec requirements 
finn and edward i obrien president of the securities industry 
association agreed that the change wouldnt hurt small investors 
although it favors large institutional investors such as banks 
mutual funds and insurance companies 
little guys invest through these investment funds which are 
large investors said finn adding that the change will lower 
the costs of those financial services that will indirectly benefit 
individual investors 
i dont think it rule 144a is going to impinge on the rights 
of individual investors because it will not necessarilly create a 
market that will interfere with them obrien said
