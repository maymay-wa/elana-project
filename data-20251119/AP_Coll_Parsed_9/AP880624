the chance to swim with a pod of 
dolphins and even hop a ride on a passing dorsal fin has tourists 
lining up at attractions in the florida keys but some 
environmental activists worry the animals will be exploited 
three attractions and a resort in the keys charge as much as 50 
each to tourists who have been on waiting lists for more than a 
month to take their 15minute dolphin encounter 
where else are you able to get up close and feel the dolphins 
skin and experience its gentleness and the way it uses its 
echolocation systems said mike wood curator of theater of the 
seas ocean park in islamorada people leave here with a whole new 
appreciation for these animals its a tremendous educational 
experience 
stormy and genie the attractions two 7footlong atlantic 
bottlenose dolphins have splashed along with 12 swimmers every day 
for the past year they appear to relish the human contact 
nuzzling kisses on the cheeks of young women wagging their 
powerful tails to stand in the water and dance and even flying 
out of the water to turn somersaults above swimmers heads 
the dolphins chirp and click after each task until the trainer 
has rewarded them with fish the wideeyed tourists come away with 
spectacular photographs and a few minutes theyll never forget 
this is something ive wanted to do my whole life and now i 
can say ive done it alan larosee of north providence ri 
said as he climbed out of the oceanside landlocked lagoon 
but the environmental group greenpeace is not as enthusiastic 
it views any public display of dolphins for profit as 
exploitative and is calling for government regulation of swim 
programs 
the dolphin swims in the keys have been very popular and 
thats been encouraging several big resorts around the country to 
think about capturing dolphins for a program of their own said 
lesley scheele of the fort lauderdale chapter of greenpeace 
our concern is that this could escalate to the point where 
everybody trying to lure a tourist is applying to capture dolphins 
for a swim program she said this could end up putting a major 
strain on wild populations 
dolphins have been a protected species since 1972 under the 
marine mammal protection act which allows for the tightly 
controlled capture of dolphins for public display 
but the law doesnt specifically address dolphin encounters 
or how they should be operated 
ive seen some places where they dump 10 people in the water 
and theyre all grabbing at one dolphin all the animal wants to 
do is get away said chip hershaw a trainer at the nonprofit 
dolphin research center on grassy key which has operated a swim 
program for three years 
theres a right way and and wrong way to go about it he 
said 
theater of the seas dolphin research center and dolphins plus 
in key largo are the only places that have been granted federal 
display permits along with special experimental permits to run the 
swim programs while hawks cay resort operates dolphin swims with 
only a display permit said brian gorman a spokesman for the 
national marine fisheries service in washington dc 
the regulatory agency has conducted public hearings on the issue 
here and in washington and has appointed an expert panel to come up 
with a set of dolphin encounter guidelines gorman said 
until those rules are issued expected by midsummer the 
fisheries service has ordered a moratorium on any more dolphin swim 
programs that has delayed plans by a hyatt hotel in hawaii to 
capture six dolphins for swims with guests gorman said 
ideally wed like to see the dolphin swims restricted to only 
nonprofit research facilities places where theres a real 
educational mission said ms scheele of greenpeace anytime 
profit is the main motive theres a possibility of abuse 
the group has also recommended that any swim facility be set up 
to allow dolphins to come and go from the wild freely and not be 
forced to interact with humans said bo bricklemyer a greenpeace 
attorney in washington 
there may also be health risks when humans swim with dolphins 
ms scheele said since it is not known exactly what is causing a 
virus that has killed hundreds of dolphins in the last year along 
the east coast she said there has been no proof that dolphins and 
humans have exchanged such viruses 
wood of theater of the seas agrees there should be some 
regulation but he feels many checks are already in place to 
protect dolphins and said forprofit attractions can help in that 
effort 
the whole idea that were out to rape the oceans of all the 
dolphins is incredibly misleading he said the federal 
government nowadays makes it a long arduous and expensive process 
just to get the approval to capture a dolphin theres no way the 
law would allow a big run on dolphins 
federal law allows fewer than 100 dolphins to be taken for 
scientific or public display purposes every year yet as many as 
12500 dolphins are allowed to be incidentally killed in nets 
in the commercial harvests of tuna and other fish gorman said 
the number of dolphins that could ever be taken for swim 
programs is a drop in the bucket wood said greenpeace has 
their priorities way out of line here its programs like ours that 
create the awareness to save the dolphins that are really 
endangered 
were not getting rich off the dolphin swim program either 
he said if we wanted to get rich we could run this like a ride 
at disney world we would never allow that to happen

governors from 10 parched states held an emergency meeting 
thursday to plot steps to help farmers survive the worst drought in 
50 years while forestry officials said the hot dry ground was 
increasing the danger of fires 
by midafternoon temperatures once again hit the middle 90s to 
around 100 degrees from the central high plains through the lower 
missouri valley into the tennessee valley and midatlantic states 
the devastating combination of extreme heat and record low 
rainfall also continued to stall barge traffic in the nations 
midsection increased the threat of forest fires and even raised 
the possibility of higher beer prices the weather eased in parts 
of the northeast however 
in st louis the medical examiners office said thursday that a 
99yearold woman whose body was found in a sweltering bedroom the 
previous day had died from the heat but a worker who collapsed and 
died wednesday at an unairconditioned chrysler corp plant in 
nearby fenton mo was found to have died of heart disease 
unrelated to the weather officials said thursday 
the workers death had prompted others at the plant to walk off 
the job for a time but work resumed thursday chrysler said 
workers had also walked out briefly on tuesday 
records were broken in at least 25 cities including kansas 
city mo where the 102degree reading beat the 15yearold record 
by 10 degrees the 98 degrees in washington dc tied a record 
that has stood for 114 years 
the record high of 104 degrees at billings mont was 2 degrees 
short of the alltime record of 106 degrees on july 4 1937 
tucson ariz reached 113 degrees the third straight day in 
which the high reading exceeded the previous alltime record of 111 
degrees 
other cities with record highs included atlantic city nj 
98 bismarck nd 103 charleston wva 90 chattanooga 
tenn 100 evansville ind 100 greensboro nc 97 
huntsville ala 98 kansas city mo 102 memphis tenn 
101 minot nd 100 nashville tenn 101 norfolk va 
99 paducah ky 103 richmond va 100 and sheridan wyo 
103 records were tied in at least nine cities 
in chicago agriculture secretary richard lyng told 10 
midwestern governors that the federal government would do what is 
needed to aid farmers but one of the 10 said later that lyng had 
failed to recognize the full extent of the problem 
governors discussed steps to aid their struggling economies 
from the diversion of water from lake michigan to speed up the flow 
of barge traffic on the mississippi to longterm measures to halt 
the drop in water tables in the northern and western states 
in a speech to the governors lyng announced a drought hot line 
for farmers and noted that existing cop insurance and disaster loan 
programs were available as farmers determine the extent of crop 
losses in the coming days and weeks 
the situation is still fluid well need a little bit of 
time to learn what the losses are he said but we will do what 
is needed to minimize the severity of the damage 
gov george sinner of north dakota speaking at a closing news 
conference disputed lyngs comments that the drought damage was 
undetermined farmers in several states already had lost much of 
their cash crops and others have sold off entire livestock herds 
for lack of feed grain sinner said 
where i think he lyng is wrong is in the wheat area said 
sinner a democrat that damage is done and it is very very 
severe in the livestock feed area that damage is done and its 
going to grow 
lyng left the conference after his speech but said he would 
meet with reagan on friday to discuss the drought 
opening the conference illinois gov james thompson said that 
unless his state gets rain in the next 30 days we risk the loss 
of our corn crop and soybean crop and all the governors here can 
tell much the same story 
because barge traffic along the mississippi river is so crucial 
to agriculture thompson proposed that the us army corps of 
engineers seek permission to divert water from lake michigan to 
solve the problem 
that proposal however drew the ire of gov tommy thompson from 
neighboring wisconsin who said it might turn out to be more 
disastrous over the long term than the immediate salvation it 
provides 
some 1000 barges were halted along the mississippi in memphis 
tenn area alone and dredging of the channel continued thursday 
in its first drought advisory for 1988 the national weather 
service said the outlook for the plains and midwest for the 
remaining days of the month was for more hot and dry weather 
but a cold front brought some relief to the northeast 
we got tremendous rain it was a godsend said priscilla 
palmer at her farm in pownal vt where 22 inches of rain fell 
overnight everyone looked outside and said thank you lord 
in kentucky the heat was blamed for exacerbating a train 
derailment and chemical leak late wednesday that drove thousands 
from their homes phosphorus coming out of a derailed tanker burst 
into flames spreading a toxic cloud across five western kentucky 
counties white phosphorus spontaneously burns when exposed to air 
temperatures above 85 or 90 degrees officials said 
the weather also raised the spectre of forest fires one of the 
governors in chicago on thursday george mickelson of south dakota 
had spent 2 hours wednesday viewing two large fires from the air 
in the northwestern part of his state 
us forest service officials told him vegetation was so dry 
that they couldnt get readings on their instruments mickelson 
said they have never recorded higher temperatures with lower 
moisture levels it is tinder dry he said 
fires had burned more than 10000 acres in the state officials 
said there were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings 
the drought could even increase beer prices because of a huge 
increase in the cost of barley a prime ingredient of the sudsy 
brew industry officials said 
robert weinberg a st louis brewing consultant said if 
barley went through the roof were probably talking a 3 to 4 
percent price increase at the retail level 
if not yet through the roof perhaps prices are at least 
heading toward the rafters since june 6 the drought has pushed 
the average price for barley from 255 to 260 per bushel to 
430 to 450 said marge jones owner and publisher of the 
brewers bulletin in woodstock ill

a group of lawyers working out of a tworoom 
office behind gray brick walls in central beijing has come to the 
defense of the rising number of chinese women who seek legal means 
to redress wrongs 
according to the law women in china have equal status with men 
but in reality women traditionally are often looked down upon 
they increasingly face discrimination at work particularly in 
hiring and promotions supervisors frequently reject women 
applicants on the grounds they are not as efficient or skillful as 
men 
accounts of wife beatings appear regularly in the chinese press 
and cases of arranged marriages and girls being sold into marriage 
have resurfaced in the countryside 
the 18 lawyers at the beijing 8th lawyer office 17 of whom are 
women exclusively help women facing such problems in the past 
three years they have counseled more than 3000 women and handled 
nearly 400 cases in court 
on the walls of their small office near tiananmen square are 
reminders of some of their victories 
a set of calligraphy scrolls commissioned by a grateful client 
who won her case against a bigamist husband hangs just inside the 
door 
upright for life your spirit lives as long as heaven and 
earth it says in praise of the lawyers 
established in 1985 by the allchina womens federation the 
legal center is the first and largest of its kind in china 
similar legal aid offices for women have opened in the southern 
city of canton guangzhou and in sichuan province but none has as 
big a staff or case load as the beijing office 
everyone has the same goal the deputy chief lawyer zhang 
xiaoqing said of her colleagues we want to use our legal 
knowledge for the benefit of women and children 
in the cramped and badly lit office yu lin in her 60s 
conducted an interview one recent day with a 47yearold divorced 
woman who was fighting for custody of her 6yearold son 
nearby tian hui a 24yearold lawyer sat at a narrow wooden 
desk carefully taking notes as a 39yearold factory worker from 
the countryside talked about her dissatisfaction with a recent 
divorce settlement 
the client fought back tears as she related how her second 
husband asked for a divorce because his two children by a previous 
marraige were grown and he no longer needed her 
the district court had already granted the divorce but she was 
unhappy with the financial settlement which awarded her husband 
their six joint bank accounts their apartment and furnishings and 
bicycle 
women like these have a hard time getting legal aid because 
china has a shortage of lawyers only 20000 to 30000 for a 
country of more than 1 billion people zhang said 
the 8th lawyers office is open mornings for walkin 
consultations in the afternoons the lawyers work on cases 
fees start at 50 fen 13 cents for consultations and are never 
more than 2 yuan 54 cents the basic fee is 1 yuan 27 cents 
but about onethird of the women are too poor to pay even that 
to represent a client in a divorce case the lawyers charge 30 
to 50 yuan 8 to 13 based on rates set by the state but again 
about 30 percent of the women pay less or nothing 
some women learn of the office from a notice in the beijing 
intermediate peoples court while others are referred by the 
womens federation 
we only take on those cases that are reasonable zhang said 
if they have no legal reason for bringing up a case we try to 
explain the law to them thats part of our work too 
one of their more interesting cases involved a 60yearold 
deafmute woman whose husband was branded a counterrevolutionary 
during the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
out of concern for his wife and two children the man divorced 
the wife and told her they would remarry if his perilous situation 
improved 
after the cultural revolution he was rehabilitated received 
back pay and given compensation for his home and household goods 
that were confiscated 
the man however married someone else moved to another 
province and never paid child support or gave any kind of financial 
assistance to his first wife for the years she reared their 
children on her own 
the 8th lawyers office took her case to court which ruled that 
the man had to pay the woman 1500 yuan 405

through nationwide radio and tv ads and a 
mailing to every american household carole lafavor has come to 
represent the anguish of people afflicted with aids 
obviously women can get aids im here to witness to that 
aids is not a we they disease its an us disease ms 
lafavor says in messages broadcast since october and in packets 
mailed this month 
in january doctors told the 40yearold single mother from 
minneapolis she had six weeks to live doctors cant explain why 
they were wrong but ms lafavor says educating others gives her a 
purpose 
it is one of the reasons why i am alive it is an important 
vocation she said 
everybody says its important for people to see the faces and 
hear the voices of the people who have the disease and so thats 
why i do it if one person can be prevented from getting the 
disease by any one thing i say its worth it she said 
ms lafavor learned she had aidsrelated complex in the fall of 
1986 she says she engaged in a lot of unsafe behavior including 
sharing needles with other drug abusers until she was caught 
stealing drugs from the hospital where she worked as a registered 
nurse 
counseling helped and she worked a year and a half as a 
chemical dependency counselor until aids struck and she was forced 
onto medical disability 
six months ago she and four other people including another 
aids sufferer founded spirits alive which trains people to teach 
others about acquired immune deficiency syndrome a deadly disease 
for which there is no known cure 
she also surrendered some of her privacy to appear in the public 
service announcements and mailings produced at the direction of 
the us centers for disease control 
if those of us who have it arent willing to talk about it 
were not going to be able to get the word out as effectively 
said ms lafavor a woman with a face creased with lines who 
appears older than her 40 years she is identified only as carole 
in the mailings 
while she agreed to be identified by her full name in an 
interview ms lafavor said she was leery about having it printed 
in the brochures 
i was trying to protect my daughters confidentiality i sort 
of figure i can handle the negative things but its not fair for 
her to have to thankfully that hasnt happened ms lafavor 
said 
instead she says she has received support 
a young friend of her 9yearold adopted daughter theresa 
offered sympathy after seeing ms lafavor in the public service 
announcements 
she said i hope your mom doesnt die i think thats a 
pretty sensitive thing for a 9yearold child to say theresa felt 
supported by it said ms lafavor who has made arrangements for 
a friend to adopt her daughter 
ms lafavor said she felt the ads were making an impact when a 
woman in a hairstyling salon slipped her a note as she was leaving 
she said she had seen me on tv and that for the first time it 
had really caused her to stop and think about her own behavior and 
about the whole issue of aids said ms lafavor 
she received about 1000 for the public service announcements 
for the approximately 75 speeches she has given in the last year 
mostly to health organizations and american indian groups ms 
lafavor an ojibwe indian received only payment for expenses 
offers to speak have increased since she made the public service 
announcements but she said she has to choose carefully because she 
fatigues easily and doesnt want to spend too much time far away 
from her daughter 
ms lafavor still wiry says she most misses running and 
staying athletic since she got aids her home decorated with 
indian art objects is in a workingclass neighborhood of south 
minneapolis 
ms lafavor was among about 30 people contacted through aids 
education groups and interviewed last year for the broadcast 
announcements and brochures people who see her say they are 
surprised she has aids that she seems shes somebody they would 
like to know said stephen heller vice president and creative 
director at ogilvy amp mather advertisings atlanta office theyre 
surprised she has aids because she doesnt fit the stereotypes

when larry mundth went to market to sell his livestock he knew 
all about the drought outside but he wasnt quite ready for the 
flood inside 
cattle filled the milwaukee stockyards where mundth and other 
anxious farmers gathered to sell their animals in what has become 
another casualty of the midwests worst drought in 50 years 
business is booming at stockyards and auction barns across the 
heartland as farmers faced with hay shortages and rising feed 
prices are liquidating their herds the selling frenzy meanwhile 
has pushed down livestock prices 
its not an easy ballgame to play said mundth a reedsburg 
wis farmer who last week sold a dozen steers no one 
appreciates selling when its a buyers market they buyers were 
enjoying the feast 
these slaughterhouses are all filled up he added all of 
these animals that have flooded the market its very 
upsetting 
mundth said his steers were ready for market but other farmers 
fearing lower prices and hay shortages are sending beef cattle to 
slaughter before they are mature and in some cases are selling off 
dairy cattle 
some of the people look at the feed supply and feel theyre 
going to take whatever they can said norbert brandt general 
manager of the midwest livestock producers cooperative in 
wisconsin its a very tense situation very demoralizing 
some of them think prices will go down even more he added 
every day that goes by without rain the situation is that much 
more worse 
the liquidation in recent weeks has been a boon to midwest 
auction houses which charge a commission to the seller chuck 
levitt a market analyst estimated the drought may be bringing an 
additional 10000 to 15000 cattle to market each week 
there has also been an increase in hog and sows being 
slaughtered because of higher price of feed but the jump has not 
been as great as the increase in the number of cattle 
in southern missouri officials at the ozark regional stockyards 
last week had a record number of cattle sold the 5650 head was 1 
times the number sold in the same period in 1987 
at the milwaukee stockyards a 20 percent to 30 percent increase 
in receipts was posted last week said cattle salesman bob strauss 
theres a little bit of panic selling he said people 
need money all the time in farming if thats all youve got you 
sell whatever sells the best 
but selling now means less profit strauss said cows early this 
week were 39 cents a pound a sharp drop from the 5152 cents of 
two weeks ago 
some also fear the rush to market now could have dire 
consequences later 
that old cow is the factory said russ harriman executive 
vice president of the missouri cattlemens association shes the 
one that produces next years calf crop if you dont have a 
factory you dont have a calf crop you dont have anything to 
sell next year 
and for those who sell and want to start over competition will 
be fierce 
when people all want to rebuild the herd theyre going to be 
bidding against each other said c william swank executive vice 
president of the ohio farm bureau 
to help farmers and slow the culling of herds ohio and some 
other midwest states have begun hotlines to match people needing 
hay with those who have it 
swank also said while consumers will enjoy lower prices in 
upcoming weeks eventually meat supplies will shrink and shoppers 
will feel the pinch 
the consumers better load up their home freezers this fall 
said levitt senior livestock analyst at shearson lehman hutton 
inc in chicago next springs prices could be record highs 
mundth 33 said if hed had more grain he would have held his 
steers longer but he said he was concerned about falling prices 
and estimated he already lost 1600 by not selling 10 days sooner 
he hopes to recoup some of his losses this fall but noted that 
our profits are so minimal its extremely difficult to make up 
for it it looks very highly unlikely this is going to be a 
very good year

west germanys parliament has approved 
a tax reform package that will cut income taxes by about 11 
billion beginning in 1990 
the bundestag passed the legislation thursday by a 256209 vote 
independent west german economists welcomed the tax reform 
package but have argued that it should take effect earlier than 
1990 to stimulate the countrys sluggish economic growth 
economists have also pointed out that the legislations effects 
would be partially offset by an increase in consumer tax revenues 
of about 4 billion next year 
the tax reform package goes before the bundesrat upper house

anatoly n rybakov author of children of the 
arbat is in the front rank of those struggling to reform the 
soviet system a system which sent him to siberia in the 1930s and 
blocked publication of his novel for 21 years his book finally 
published in russian last year has recently appeared in english 
and his been critically acclaimed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
anatoly naumovich rybakov still 
energetic at 77 jumped up and pulled a bundle of papers from one 
of the shelves that line the study of his cottage in the forested 
writers colony outside moscow 
carefully lovingly the novelist laid the bundle on the desk 
next to the window untied the string and pulled out two covers of 
the largest soviet literary magazine novy mir one from 1966 and 
the other from 1978 
in the soft light filtered through the trees rybakov held up 
first one and then the other of the blue sheets of stiff paper 
tracing with his gnarled finger the underlined announcement that 
the journal would soon publish children of the arbat his novel 
of the great terror waged by dictator josef v stalin in the 1930s 
both times in 1966 and 1978 publication was blocked by the men 
in the kremlin men who rose to power under stalin 
rybakovs patience paid off 
more than 21 years after it was written children of the 
arbat was published last year in the literary journal druzhba 
narodov friendship of peoples as part of mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign to reform the tyrannical system created by stalin 
the novel has since appeared in hardback editions and was 
published in english in the united states last month by little 
brown amp co 
the book probes more deeply than any other yet published in the 
soviet union into stalins mind and methods the pettiness and 
arbitrariness that guided his followers the innocence of his 
victims and the terror he created 
it tells the story of sasha pankratov a young man of 23 who 
like rybakov was sentenced without trial for a crime he never 
committed and sent to siberia for three years of cold and lonely 
exile 
rybakov grew up in the apartment building inhabited by most of 
the books characters no 51 arbat street an old shopping street 
in downtown moscow that was at once popular among the communist 
party elite and among fashionable young people 
rybakov is working on the sequel 1935 and other years 
which will continue the story and like children of the arbat 
will give intimate portraits of stalin and his lieutenants and 
describe how he terrorized his deputies and the country 
the entire nation lived in fear said rybakov his craggy 
features grim beneath a balding pate and gray hair only one 
person thought for himself everyone else abandoned free thought 
gorbachev and his supporters have concluded that a nation based 
on such a system cannot survive in the technological age 
during the years rybakov waited for his blockbuster to appear in 
print he lived and worked at his peaceful dacha or cottage at 
peredelkino the wooded village where the nobel prizewinning poet 
and novelist boris pasternak wrote and is buried rybakov earned a 
comfortable living by writing 11 other novels as well as 
screenplays for television and movies 
he resisted the temptation to publish his works abroad as 
pasternak aleksandr solzhenitsyn and others had done pasternak 
was ostracized his works banned until recently and solzhenitsyn 
was exiled to the west 
i wanted to publish it in this country said rybakov i 
wanted to change my country that is why i have been so patient 
hardback and paperbound editions of the book are expected to 
reach 35 million copies he said a phenomenal circulation in the 
soviet union where a run of 100000 is considered generous for 
works of fiction 
the book disappears from stores before it reaches the shelves 
the only places it can be found in moscow are in hotel shops open 
only to foreigners and at a special store on kropotkin street that 
accepts no rubles only western currency on the black market it 
sells for 30 rubles 5140 more than 10 times its retail price 
inside the kropotkin store a saleswoman told an american 
visitor im sorry we dont have children of the arbat it 
hasnt come in yet 
then she lowered her voice ill get you a copy but just 
one she disappeared returning a few minutes later with the 
volume 
the written word has played a huge role in russia since the 19th 
century when works by writers such as pushkin and tolstoy were a 
moral and spiritual counterbalance to the authoritarian rule of the 
czars the influence of writers in the soviet union is immensely 
greater than that of any american author in the united states 
i dont think that fiction is as important in the united 
states in shaping the image of a country in the minds of the 
people said rybakov just back from a monthlong trip to 
america his third visit in as many years 
in reforming the soviet system said rybakov the first step 
is to change the psychology of the people perestroika 
restructuring started in literature films the mass media the 
fields that shape peoples spiritual lives and thinking 
we need to reshape peoples minds and that will inevitably 
lead us to economic freedom said rybakov 
children of the arbat deals largely with the purges within 
the communist party and only mentions in passing a far bloodier 
episode the 192932 collectivization of agriculture which 
caused a famine and according to estimates by western scholars 
claimed 8 million lives 
rybakov said he will explore this in greater depth in his next 
novel 
my figures are even higher he said 
although food shortages persist six decades later soviet 
authors have only tentatively touched on the collectivization 
issue any detailed discussion might lead to calls to return the 
land to private farmers a step reformers in china have taken 
rybakov lets a grin crease his leathery face i am no expert 
on decollectivization but we need greater freedom in the village 
the smile gives way again to a look of grim determination who 
will take land and cultivate it if he fears that someone will take 
it away from him

the party of five from the advertising agency was 
not unusual says restaurant owner neville blech they reserved a 
table for 1 pm and called at 140 pm to cancel 
but for blech it was the last straw he sued the agency in 
small claims court and won demonstrating how some british 
restaurants are beginning to fight back against the problem of 
noshow diners 
these people are messing about with my livelihood its bad 
news says blech who won about 140 or the average gross 
profit from a lunch for five at mijanou his posh 30seat french 
eatery 
while few choose to sue many are casting off customary british 
reserve to fight what they say is a growing lack of consideration 
among modern diners some say american tourists are among the worst 
offenders 
but this in turn has caused divisions with other restaurateurs 
saying noshows are an inescapable fact of life 
the restaurateurs association of great britain representing 500 
dining spots mostly in london is compiling a list of repeat 
offenders for its members 
certain people have already come to light after six weeks of 
collecting information association chairman roy ackerman said in 
an interview 
he denied it was a blacklist saying the association lets the 
restaurant decide whether it wants to refuse a booking or ask for a 
deposit in advance 
ackerman acknowledges the tactic may scare away customers or be 
dodged by using a false name but he believes the mere existence of 
the list may be a deterrent 
were there to serve people so we dont want to put people 
off booking or eating out he says but were trying to ask for 
courtesy in exchange for our hospitality 
the association took action because it seemed to be a practice 
which was growing we had complaints from a lot of our members 
who suspect some people double or triplebook 
blech estimates he loses 8850 annually from noshows and 
places some blame on transatlantic visitors 
judging by their accents i have to say some of the worst 
offenders are american tourists he says they come over pick 
your name out of a guide shop late at harrods and decide theyre 
too tired to go out to eat 
ackerman however says people from all walks of life are 
guilty adding whos going to say anything about the americans 
we need them 
he says the spread of the problem is a natural phenomenon 
because more and more people are eating out competition to get 
a good table at a restaurant is that much more competitive 
restaurateurs say customers dont realize that when they book a 
table they are entering into a contract a fact of british law 
that won blech his court case 
noshows also dont understand how much they can hurt a 
restaurant a 40seat eatery may not break even on a night when a 
table of four or six fails to show up says ackerman 
the rival 15000member british hotels restaurants and caterers 
association also worries about the problem but disagrees with 
drawing up a list 
we dont believe its easy to operate said robin lees 
chief executive of the association the only way to make sure is 
that when the contract is made the owner has sufficient 
information to come back either in small claims court or on the 
telephone to say look we had a contract 
others say even that sounds too strong 
if you lose a table once every few days it doesnt matter so 
much says aron misan the french owner of keats eatery its 
part of the business 
he says he calls noshows the next day says youve been a 
naughty boy and then this chap has respect for you you keep 
friends the other way you make enemies

phosphorus inside a derailed tank car 
reignited thursday night as workers tried the right the car and 
authorities urged a second nighttime evacuation because of a 
windblown toxic cloud officials said 
the intensity of the smoke has diminished significantly its 
not without its problems but it now appears to be taking a better 
direction don armstrong a spokesman for the state department of 
disaster and emergency services said late thursday night 
phosphorus spilled from the ruptured tanker in wednesday nights 
34car derailment formed a cloud and then burst into flames in the 
99degree heat burning for more than 12 hours 
the toxic cloud forced residents in five western kentucky 
counties to evacuate and about 50 familes living in the immediate 
area were advised to stay away from their homes thursday 
the new cloud 100 yards wide and 400 feet high was moving 
southeast toward the tiny community of apex in northeast christian 
county where officials warned residents but evacuations were 
voluntary armstrong said 
he said officials believe the fire will burn itself out but 
were still cautioning people to stay upwind from the smoke 
earlier thursday officials said the crew of the derailed 
freight train might have avoided the accident had it seen a 10 mph 
speed limit sign 
the speed limit was posted because of a track problem the train 
was traveling 35 mph tim hensley a spokesman for csx 
transportation corp said thursday 
this probably is a factor but we are not saying that this is 
a cause hensley said and it has not been developed whether it 
was human error on the part of the crew or whether they were not 
provided with the information with regards to that slow order 
hensley said the safety order was issued because of a 
oneblocklong stretch of rough track possibly caused by heat 
extension of the rails 
hensley said the track was supposed to have been posted with a 
warning sign one mile before the rough section but the crew 
reported that they didnt see it the only sign they said they saw 
was at the point of the rough track he said it was too late then 
to avoid the derailment 
residents evacuated from the path of the toxic vapor began 
returning to their homes thursday officials asked about 50 
families in the immediate vicinity of the derailment to stay out of 
the area 
the evacuations included towns in five counties with a combined 
population of about 2500 but red cross workers were unable to say 
immediately how many people left their homes 
no serious injuries were reported but several people were 
treated for throat and lung irritations caused by the smoke which 
blanketed the rural area 80 miles northwest of nashville tenn 
randy looney and his wife tricia were roused by firefighters 
scooped up their infant son and headed for a shelter set up at the 
crofton elementary school 
their house trailer less than two miles from the derailment was 
filled with acrid smoke looney said 
it smelled like sulfur and burned your lungs he said 
when we went outside you could hardly see anything 
the chemical burst into flames when the 34 cars derailed in a 
steep ravine about two miles north of crofton a town of about 900 
people 
the federal aviation administration restricted air traffic over 
the site until about dawn thursday and safety workers temporarily 
sealed off roads in the vicinity

the university of arkansas violated the 
constitutional rights of a homosexual group by denying it funds a 
federal appeals court has ruled 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
overturned a lower court ruling wednesday and ordered appropriate 
relief to the schools gay and lesbian students association gsla 
the gsla filed suit after the universitys student senate which 
decides on funding for student organizations denied the groups 
request for funds because of the content of its message a 
violation of the first amendment 
in brief the appeals court said we hold that a public 
body that chooses to fund speech or expression must do so 
evenhandedly without discriminating among recipients on the basis 
of their ideology 
the university need not supply funds to student organizations 
but once having decided to do so it is bound by the first 
amendment to act without regard to the content of the ideas being 
expressed 
this will mean that the taxpayers will occasionally be 
obligated to support not only the thought of which they approve 
but also the thought that they hate this is one of the fundamental 
premises of american law 
the appeals court rejected the schools claims that the case was 
moot and that it does not have the final say over the student 
senates funding decisions 
in elaborating on its decision the appeals court said true 
sodomy is illegal in arkansas however the glsa does not advocate 
sodomy and even if it did its speech about an illegal activity 
would still be protected by the first amendment people may extol 
the virtues of arson or even cannibalism they simply may not 
commit the acts

a 44yearold airplane carrying allied ambassadors 
flew from frankfurt to berlin to highlight celebrations marking the 
airlift that fed 2 million city residents during a soviet blockade 
40 years ago 
among the passengers thursday was one of the berlin airlifts 
original pilots dubbed raisin bombers who said that out of 
fairness he droppped candy and raisins to children in both the 
communist and western halves of the city 
the berlin airlift changed this city and it changed the 
world us ambassador richard burt said of the june 
1948september 1949 operation which delivered more than 18 million 
tons of food and vital supplies to berlins alliedcontrolled 
western sectors 
accompanying burt on thursday on the dc3 a civilian version of 
the military c47 transports used during the airlift were british 
ambassador sir christopher mallaby french ambassador serge 
boidevaix and west german defense minister rupert scholz 
longtime berlin resident helga galler 60 was among the 400 
people waiting for the landing at berlins templehof airport she 
said she recalled well the shortages and feelings of hopelessness 
created by the soviet blockade 
everything was in short supply food clothing everything 
mrs galler said so when we saw these planes coming we knew we 
didnt have to worry any longer 
i dont what we would have done without them mrs galler 
said 
at the end of world war ii berlin was divided into soviet 
us british and french sectors the city was surrounded by 
sovietcontrolled territory that later became east germany 
bitter disputes between the kremlin and the united states 
britain and france led to the soviet move to cut all berlin off 
from the west 
specifically soviet leader josef stalin was staunchly against 
the creation of a unified german state in the three western 
occupation zones and when the western allies backed a currency 
reform to speed up germanys economic recovery moscow imposed the 
blockade 
retired air force col gail halvorsen who accompanied the 
ambassadors on the plane was the first to begin dropping raisins 
and candy to berlins children to sweeten the supplies they were 
already receiving 
halvorsen 67 said that once during the airlift days he 
received a letter asking why no candy was dropped over berlins 
eastern sector 
so i flew over east berlin after that and started dropping 
candy there too he said 
but after one such run halvorsen said an officer came up to 
me and asked what i was doing he told me the russians had 
complained that we were trying to influence the thinking of the 
kids over there so i had to stop it halvorsen who was a 
27yearold us army air force lieutenant when he started flying 
berlin airlift missions in july 1948 said he flew a total of 126 
roundtrip missons from july 1948 to february 1949 taking off from 
the us rhine main base near frankfurt 
he later became commander of the us air force at tempelhof air 
base from 1970 to 1974 he has since retired from the military and 
makes his home in provo utah 
halvorsen said he first had his crew throw out candy to children 
waiting at templehof airport 
there were only about 30 kids gathered at the airport on 
that run he said but the idea spread like wildfire and soon 
there were thousands of children throughout the city waiting for 
sweets to be tossed out of airlift planes which were quickly 
dubbed raisin bombers 
when the soviets blocked off allied access to the western 
sectors of berlin in 1948 they also cut delivery of electricity 
and food from berlins communistcontrolled eastern sector 
in response the allies officially announced the berlin airlift 
on june 26 1948 by the time the airlift ended on sept 30 1949 
more than 277000 planeloads of food and supplies had been brought 
to the former german capital

president reagan put in a plug for vice 
president george bush during this weeks economic summit but 
getting bush elected as his successor apparently isnt the 
presidents top priority 
in fact it was 15th on a list of items on reagans agenda that 
was put together by a reagan aide 
reagan obviously hopes to witness the inauguration of the 
republican vice president as his successor next jan 20 but just 
how much he will do in the bush campaign remains a question mark 
reagan went out of his way during the toronto summit to bring 
bush into the picture lauding the vice presidents role in the 
fight against drugs during his concluding speech to members of the 
empire and canadian clubs 
drugs have only once before been on our agenda at an 
economic summit he said a north american dialogue between prime 
minister brian mulroney and vice president bush put them there 
this time 
over breakfast in washington in april the prime minister and 
the vice president exchanged thoughts on how our countries could 
work together to fight the drug kingpins reagan said one area 
they discussed was appropriate for the talks at this summit how 
to prevent the laundering of money across international borders 
canadas strong support for the bush initiative is reflected 
in the historic commitment endorsed by the summit leaders in the 
toronto communique he said canada agreed to steppedup 
cooperative efforts to stop drug money laundering 
later as the president flew back to washington on air force 
one reporters sent a note forward asking to speak with kenneth 
duberstein the deputy chief of staff who is taking over from 
retiring chief of staff howard h baker jr they said they wanted 
to talk about the presidents postsummit agenda 
what they got in return was a note from white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater listing in this order 
strategic arms reduction talks 
a united nations resolution enforcing a ceasefire in the 
persian gulf 
peace in nicaragua 
efforts to get a trade bill acceptable to the administration 
welfare reform 
signing of a bill providing catastrophic illness insurance 
a fair housing bill that the president supports 
help for farmers hardpressed by the drought 
approval of the uscanadian free trade agreement 
peace in the middle east 
the work of the presidents drug task force 
the budget and appropriations bills 
the investigation of department of defense procurement 
the republican convention 
finally in 15th place came support for the bush campaign it 
was followed on the list by official visits by leaders of turkey 
and australia a forthcoming trip to miami and several other items 
the impression was that the president would campaign for bush 
when he got the time but that hes still president and has other 
things to do 
its an impression thats been around for some time after bush 
wrapped up the republican nomination reagan delayed endorsing him 
for several weeks and then gave an endorsement that was viewed as 
so lackluster that the white house followed up with a formal 
presidential statement to make clear that he was really for bush 
behind the scenes negotiations continue over what role the 
president will play an administration official familiar with the 
discussions said decisions are expected to be made before the gop 
convention opens in new orleans in midaugust

the house ethics committee has launched a 
preliminary investigation to determine if georgia rep pat swindall 
violated the law or house rules in pursuing a loan after being told 
it likely would be financed by drug money he would be helping to 
launder 
after a closeddoor meeting thursday the committee issued a 
statement saying it had received evidence reasonably indicating 
that swindall a secondterm republican may have violated laws or 
acceptable standards in his negotiations for an 850000 loan 
swindall who represents a suburban atlanta district asked the 
committee last week to review his actions in the negotiations last 
fall for the loan he was seeking to finance construction of his 
12 million home in stone mountain ga 
swindall left washington for georgia on thursday arriving at 
hartsfield atlanta international airport he said he had asked for 
and welcomed the investigation 
basically ive turned it over to them he said if 
anything unethicals been done i want to know 
a preliminary inquiry is the first step in an ethics committee 
investigation if the panel finds reason to believe that the 
alleged violation in fact occurred it makes a formal statement of 
the violation and can ultimately recommend disciplinary action 
ranging from reprimand to expulsion 
swindall asked for the investigation one day after the atlanta 
journal and the atlanta constitution reported details of the loan 
negotiations that came from conversations secretly recorded during 
a federal money laundering investigation 
the taped conversations involved discussions between swindall 
and two other men charles lechansey who later was indicted on 
money laundering charges and michael mullaney an undercover 
internal revenue service agent posing as a money broker for 
underworld figures 
the newspaper said the tapes show that swindall continued to 
pursue the loan for several weeks after mullaney had advised him 
that it might be financed with illegal drug or gambling profits 
swindall at one point accepted a 150000 check from lechansey 
but returned it uncashed several days later the tapes show that he 
broke off the negotiations after mullaney told him he would have to 
accept the loan proceeds in cash and sign a receipt for them 
the only reason i cant do that is i would then be essentially 
laundering yalls money swindall told mullaney according to 
the newspapers account of the tapes in other words if charles 
lechasney wants to launder yalls money fine but i cant do 
that and to sign a receipt of cash would be to do that 
at a news conference last week swindall apologized for his role 
in the negotiations saying he was wrong and ashamed but would 
continue to seek reelection 
i was wrong to have ever considered such a proposal to have 
discussed it he said i was wrong not to have gone to 
authorities before i did 
swindall said however that he eventually made the right 
decision in walking away from the deal and insisted that he did 
not break the law nor do anything unethical 
swindall is the only candidate in the aug 9 republican primary 
for his 4th district seat since qualifying for the primary has 
ended his name is the only one that can appear on the republican 
primary ballot under state law 
three democrats are competing in their partys primary for the 
right to challenge swindall in the november general election

discovery of 10 million military medical records that duplicate 
some lost in a 1973 fire 
veterans groups say thousands of veterans from world war ii and 
the korean war could be affected by the discovery they say the 
newfound records would provide verification for claims denied 
because there were no records to substantiate them 
thomas k turnage the va administrator announced the discovery 
on thursday and called it a very important development 
it opens up new vistas for us it means that these people who 
before had difficulty establishing a basis for their disability 
compensation or the degree of it it means we can have another 
chance to look at it and in effect may come up with a different 
result turnage said 
the va said that it would immediately begin going through the 
new data and reviewing claims rejected because of lost records the 
agency urged veterans seeking information about their claims to 
contact their va regional offices 
turnage said the va had become aware of the information last 
week and it was too early to say how many people would be 
affected he also did not have figures on how many claims were 
denied because of lost records 
officials cautioned against overestimating the impact of the 
discovery rj vogel the vas benefits director said that most 
veterans who made disability claims did so during their initial 
years after service and would likely have filed claims before 1973 
but john sommer director of the american legion veterans 
affairs and rehabilitation commission whose office helps veterans 
with their disability claims said there was no doubt the 
development could affect thousands 
youd be amazed at the number of people world war ii veterans 
in particular who waited until they retired to file a claim with 
the va and then found the records had been destroyed he said 
many of them felt they just didnt want to take anything from the 
government then as they aged they decided to file a claim 
and discovered their records had been burned 
others likely to be affected include people with an injury or 
disease suffered during active duty that became more pronounced 
over the years such as a back or heart ailments officials said 
eighteen million military personnel records were destroyed or 
seriously damaged in the july 12 1973 fire at the national 
personnel record center in st louis the lost records were from 
the years 1912 through 1959 for army personnel and 1947 through 
1963 for air force personnel with the surnames of hubbard and 
through the letter z 
the duplicate records cover the years 1942 to 1945 and 1950 to 
1954 and so will primarily affect veterans of world war ii and the 
korean war 
the records were collected by the national research council a 
private research organization during the 1950s as part of its 
analysis of army hospital records a researcher at the council came 
across the records and notified the national archives said jill 
brett an archives spokeswoman 
ms brett said that the records are on computer magnetic tapes 
created by the council from hospital admissions punch cards 
prepared by the office of the surgeon general she said the 
archives paid the council 8662 for the tapes and will reformat 
them for crossreferencing against other files 
she said they were not listed by the military officers name 
but included the officers serial number grade and rank age date 
and place of admission as well as disease and diagnosis 
of the 10 million files there were 35 million files for the 
year 1944 alone turnage said covering about 24 million people 
for 1945 2 million files were discovered covering about 14 
million people he said the agency still was trying to compile the 
breakdown for the other years

the parents of a teenager who was shot by 
syndicated columnist carl t rowan after taking an unauthorized dip 
in the journalists pool say their son may have shown immaturity 
but rowan displayed even worse judgment by responding with a deadly 
weapon 
the us attorneys office said thursday that rowan would not 
face assault charges stemming from the june 14 incident but it 
deferred a decision on whether to bring weapons charges against the 
columnist to district of columbia authorities 
us attorney jay b stephens said in a prepared statement that 
there was a substantial basis for charging rowan an avowed 
guncontrol advocate with possession of an unregistered handgun 
the court developments angered the parents of 18yearold 
benjamin n smith of suburban chevy chase md who has been 
charged with unlawfully entering rowans northwest washington 
property 
neil smith acknowledged that his son had committed an unlawful 
act by entering rowans yard but he added was that act cause 
for mr rowan to shoot ben and possibly kill him 
dinah smith said her son certainly showed immaturity but mr 
rowans judgment is appalling 
the younger smith who was wounded in the right wrist by a 
bullet from rowans unregistered 22caliber revolver may not 
recover full use of his hand his father said 
the columnist has made no attempt to contact her family or 
apologize for the incident mrs smith added 
r stan mortenson a lawyer for 19yearold laura bachman of 
bethesda md arrested along with smith at rowans residence said 
ms bachman deeply regrets that the events of june 14th ever 
occurred 
mortenson whose client also faces a charge of unlawful entry 
called the governments case unjustified and highly unusual 
smith and ms bachman pleaded innocent to the misdemeanor charge 
thursday before a district of columbia superior court hearing 
commissioner trial was scheduled for aug 18 
rowan who has been ridiculed by progun groups as hypocritical 
for advocating handgun bans while keeping one himself refused to 
discuss the latest developments 
i am not saying one word about that decision he said when 
called at his home i think ive been very generous in talking to 
the media and ive said all im going to say 
rowan has told authorities that his son carl jr a former fbi 
agent gave him the gun after he received several threats he said 
his son had been told by city officials he did not need to register 
the weapon after leaving the fbi 
the districts farreaching 1976 handgun ordinance says that all 
weapons must be registered possession of an unregistered handgun 
or ammunition carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a 
1000 fine 
rowan has defended his use of the weapon saying he thought his 
life was in danger he said he called police after hearing noises 
in his backyard investigating and finding four people in his pool 
the columnist said he fired at smith after the young man lunged 
at him smith disputes that saying he did nothing to threaten 
rowan and was trying to flee when he was shot 
smith and ms bachman face a maximum penalty of six months in 
jail and a 400 fine if convicted the two had been charged with 
illegal entry shortly after the incident but those charges were 
withdrawn within hours pending an investigation the charges were 
reinstated thursday 
stephens said his office found insufficient evidence to warrant 
an assault charge against the 62yearold rowan but believed he 
should be charged with possession of an unregistered firearm 
the city government traditionally handles weapons charges and 
claude bailey a spokesman for the district of columbia corporation 
counsel said officials would decide within a few days whether to 
prosecute rowan

the house is close to approval of legislation 
to strengthen enforcement of the nations fair housing law after 
defeating a proposal to eliminate the ban on discrimination against 
families with children 
final approval in the house should come sometime next week 
although no specific time has been set because leaders want to 
complete action on remaining appropriation bills before the end of 
the month 
fair housing is a top priority item said house majority 
whip tony coehlo dcalif on thursday before the house recessed 
so members could attend the funeral of rep john j duncan 
rtenn in knoxville 
the senate is expected to act quickly after the house vote thus 
sending the measure to the white house before the end of the summer 
rep peter w rodino jr dnj chairman of the house 
judiciary committee said this legislation to finally make fair 
housing a reality for so many americans is another significant step 
forward for our nation in eliminating discrimination and providing 
equal opportunity for all in one of our most basic human needs 
housing 
the bill would give the department of housing and urban 
development the power to bring actions on behalf of individual 
victims of discrimination would ban discrimination against the 
disabled and forbid limitations on renting to families with 
children except in clearly defined retirement communities 
the house eliminated the last controversial amendment on 
thursday when members voted 289116 to defeat a proposal by rep 
e clay shaw jr rfla that would have eliminated the provisions 
protecting families with children under age 18 from housing 
discrimination 
shaw said that the bills language was confusing unenforceable 
and would wipe out every senior citizen community in this 
country rep don edwards dcalif chief sponsor argued that 
the provision had been drafted in consultation with groups 
representing senior citizens and had received their full support 
since enactment of the first federal law to ban discrimination 
in the sale and rental of housing in 1968 the homebuilding and 
sales industries have staved off repeated efforts to toughen 
enforcement rules the recurring battles have embittered civil 
rights advocates and denied millions of families equal access to 
decent housing 
however a crucial compromise was reached late last week and 
announced on tuesday that set the stage for quick passage of the 
bill 
originally the bill would have created a system of 
administrative law judges who would hear cases against alleged 
housing violators when conciliation failed the judges could award 
actual damages to a plaintiff and impose fines any ruling could be 
appealed to the federal court 
the reagan administration and the national association of 
realtors opposed the bill because they believed that administrative 
law judges would create constitutional problems they argued that 
an accused party could be forced to pay fines and damages without a 
jury trial in violation of the constitutions seventh amendment 
under the compromise however either the plaintiff or the 
defendant can elect to go to federal court first thus satisfying 
the objections of the administration and the realtors

president reagan says the united states will 
try to keep australia from being caught in a crossfire over farm 
subsidies but he is not offering any new steps to deal with 
australian concerns 
reagan met with australian prime minister bob hawke on thursday 
and said afterward were in full agreement on the need to open 
up international trade in agricultural products a keystone of both 
our economies 
we also agree on the need to redouble our efforts toward the 
elimination of tradedistorting government subsidies of 
agricultural products the president said in a departure ceremony 
in the white house east room 
until we achieve that goal he added we will assure that 
any measures the united states may take to counter unfair 
subsidization of agriculture will take fully into account the 
interests of countries like australia 
gaston sigur assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs when asked how this pledge would be carried out 
said well he didnt make any very specific commitments as such 
this is the same commitment that he made to the prime minister in 
1986 its a continuation of this 
at issue is a us policy of entering markets that have been 
invaded by subsidized countries australia contends that this 
damages its farmers because australia also exports to the same 
countries 
hawke in a speech to a joint meeting of congress earlier in the 
day said australias farmers are finding themselves squeezed out 
of markets by practices which distort prices and levels of 
production 
in agriculture we find ourselves caught in the crossfire of a 
destructive and counterproductive transatlantic subsidies war 
the australian leader said 
reagan advocates an end to agricultural subsidies by the year 
2000 but gained little support for his proposal from european 
powers in the sevennation economic summit that ended tuesday in 
toronto

jesse jackson stepped back from credentials 
fights at the 1988 democratic national convention but he is 
pressing forward with demands for new party rules for 1992 demands 
that could trigger a floor fight in atlanta 
the atmosphere at thursdays credentials committee meeting was 
peaceful and united with aides to jackson and dukakis exchanging 
compliments as the temporary roll of delegates to the july 
convention was agreed to without dissent 
but the rules committee meetings this weekend may be quite 
different 
there is still some disagreement with party rules state and 
national former new mexico gov toney anaya said thursday 
rev jackson has determined the proper place to take those 
disagreements is the rules committee 
he wants the convention to make the changes for next time 
said ann lewis a top jackson adviser he doesnt want it just 
referred to another commission 
the two campaigns have been working late into the night this 
week to settle as many of the issues as possible and dukakis aide 
tad devine said the negotiations are continuing on the 
delegateselection rules 
jackson has the strength to force a floor fight at the 
convention in atlanta july 1821 but he does not have enough votes 
on the rules committee to win without the agreement or at least the 
acquiescence of dukakis 
but devine said no agreements had been written in stone by 
thursday on the rules in contrast to the quiet resolution of 
dispute after dispute about credentials 
the credentials committee approved resolutions settling all of 
the delegate challenges and putting the stamp of approval on 
delegates who had not been challenged 
the only outstanding delegate disputes between the campaigns are 
in pennsylvania and puerto rico private talks to settle those 
arguments which were never filed as challenges are progressing 
both campaigns said 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk was pleased 
with the results saying it is the first time in history that the 
party will convene without delegate challenges 
looking to the future jackson is seeking specific changes in 
the rules that govern primaries and caucuses 
lewis said jacksons focus is on changes that will make a 
states delegation to the convention more closely reflect the 
popular vote among the states democrats as evidenced in a primary 
or caucus 
for most of the proposed changes there are powerful forces in 
the party who object to such revisions such as dnc members who 
could lose their automatic seats at the convention 
in specific jackson is seeking to ban directelection primaries 
and bonusdelegate systems and wants some changes in the super 
delegates 
in directelection primaries delegates are elected 
individually not in proportion to the overall popular vote in a 
district or state this tends to favor the leading candidate or the 
candidate with the most support from wellrecognized political 
figures who run for delegate slots 
in bonusdelegate states the winning candidate in each 
congressional district wins one more delegate that he would under a 
strictly proportional system 
jackson is also unhappy with having more than 600 unpledged 
super delegates at the convention whose votes do not have to follow 
the primary returns these include governors state chairmen 
members of congress and dnc members 
he also wants the 1988 convention to make these rules decisions 
for 1992 and not leave it to a party commission meeting between 
conventions jackson has said the party commission that wrote the 
1988 rules ignored its instructions from the 1984 convention 
instructions written at his urging

the pentagons chief spokesman says it has 
never tried to disguise the amount of money it spends on 
consultants particularly since a lot of the work they perform is 
demanded by congress 
dan howard in a lengthy rebuttal thursday to complaints by sen 
david h pryor dark said the pentagon will spend 387 billion 
on all types of consulting services during the current fiscal year 
pryor the chairman of a senate governmental affairs 
subcommittee that has been investigating the governments use of 
private consultants accused the pentagon on tuesday of keeping a 
shadow government under wraps 
citing a general accounting office review the senator said the 
pentagon claimed it spent only 155 million on outside consultants 
in fiscal 1987 when in reality it had spent 28 billion 
howard used his regular pentagon briefing on thursday to counter 
the assertions saying pryors figures were wrong he said the 155 
million figure came not from the defense department but from a gao 
informationgathering system that howard said demonstrates the 
maxim garbage in garbage out 
of the total the pentagon will spend this year the spokesman 
continued 254 million will go for studies analyses and 
evaluation 
one of the things it includes is a number of studies mandated 
by the congress since 1970 the number of annual studies required 
of the department of defense by the congress has increased 1900 
percent it has gone from 36 reports in 1970 to 719 reports this 
year howard said 
were it not for the contracting of these reports to 
consultants we estimate that it would have required an 
additional 29000 dod employees to do the reports 
howard said the pentagon this fiscal year will spend 114 
million on individual experts and consultants 970 million on 
management support studies such as developing a computer model 
to predict future aircraft costs 3797 million on engineering and 
technical support to teach military personnel how to operate and 
repair new weapon systems and 5838 million on information 
technology meaning the maintenance and acquisition of computer 
data bases 
all told that is 2199 billion in the fiscal 1988 budget 
the spokesman said 
in addition to those programs the pentagon will spend 943 
million on outside systems engineering contracts he continued 
systems engineering people are those who for example when 
you install a new complex system in an aircraft an existing 
aircraft ensure that the systems all fit together that they all 
work together he said 
a final category totals 725 million and involves federal 
funding for certain key research and development centers that 
perform dozens of military studies every year such as the rand 
corp and the institute for defense analysis howard said 
so if you combine the two categories the contracted advisory 
and assistance services at 2199 billion and these other contract 
services you get a grand total of 387 billion

house taxwriters trying to avoid an 
electionyear hassle with farmers are ready to repeal a new law 
requiring offtheroad business users of diesel fuel to pay the 
federal tax and then apply for a refund 
the house ways and means committee agreed thursday to add the 
repeal amendment to a package of miscellaneous tax provisions and 
to authorize refunds with interest for any taxexempt diesel users 
who have paid the tax since april 1 
the senate finance committee has agreed to repeal the diesel 
provisions retroactive to april 1 when they went into effect 
the house panel also approved tax relief for up to 20 million 
owners of shares in mutual funds and agreed to extend expiring tax 
credits for research and development and for employers who hire the 
poor and a tax exemption for mortgage bonds that benefit 
lowincome firsttime home buyers 
aides said the committee meeting behind closed doors had no 
problem approving tax relief for farmers contractors barge 
operators and others who use diesel for offtheroad business 
purposes farmers especially have complained loudly that the new 
law enacted last december drains their cash flow and increases 
their paperwork burden 
the new law aimed at tax cheats requires that such diesel 
users even though they are exempt from the tax of 151 cents a 
gallon py it and then apply for a refund the following year when 
they file their tax returns the vote thursday would repeal that 
requirement so long as a user can show evidence of taxexempt use 
the house committee added the repeal provision to a bill whose 
main purpose is to correct errors in the 1986 tax overhaul aides 
said rep dan rostenkowski dill the committee chairman hopes 
to complete work on the bill next week 
before the bill is finished the panel will have to find ways to 
pay for the special tax reductions rostenkowski has proposed a 
package that would place most of the burden on defense contractors 
owners of singlepremium life insurance and corporations that hold 
sizable shares in other corporations 
aides said it is likely that members of the committee will 
propose relief for other beneficiaries because of budget 
restrictions any such tax cut that is adopted will have to be paid 
for by a tax increase on some other group 
the committee spent much of thursdays session arguing about 
rostenkowskis proposal to tighten slightly and extend the 
mortgagebond tax exemption which is due to expire dec 31 the 
reagan administration opposes any extension 
in addition the general accounting office an arm of congress 
contends the bonds open the door to home ownership to very few 
people who could not afford to buy otherwise also gao said in a 
report last march home buyers on average receive only about 36 
to 39 cents in benefits for every dollar in tax revenue forgone 
extending the mortgagebond exemption would cost about 165 
million through 1991 
the panel also voted to 
extend through 1990 the credit for increased spending for 
research and development lawmakers view the credit as a big plus 
in the effort to make us businesses more competitive abroad to 
offset part of the cost the business deduction now allowed for 
research expenses would be reduced by the amount of the credit the 
two provisions would mean a revenue loss of 105 billion through 
1991 
permanently permit owners of mutualfund shares to fully deduct 
certain investment expenses of the funds thus granting them tax 
relief of about 1 billion through 1991 without the change many 
shareholders would be unable to write off those expenses because of 
the new restriction that allows deduction only of miscellaneous 
expenses that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income 
extend through 1990 the targetedjobs tax credits under which 
the government in effect pays up to 2400 of the firstyear wages 
of workers considered economically disadvantaged the credit due 
to expire dec 31 would cost about 315 million through 1991

frustrated house members are calling a new 16 
million telephone system a failure after its third outage in as 
many days and some are beginning to wonder whether selecting atampt 
was the right choice 
the house of representatives system was out of order for more 
than two hours on thursday bringing howls from members unable to 
communicate with constituents or with their home district offices 
the outage also forced house leaders to resort to hand signals 
to communicate with their floor organizers 
its like returning to the 19th century said one leadership 
aide 
one lawmaker rep jim kolbe rariz went to the floor and 
held up two styrofoam coffee cups linked by a piece of wire 
if i get the contract for 10 million or so to install this in 
the house of representatives i promise that it will work just as 
well as the phone system we have here now he said 
american telephone amp telegraph co flew in top management and 
technical executives from around the country in an attempt to 
ferret out the mystery bug in the balky computer switching system 
the system called system 85 controls some 17000 telephones in 
three house office buildings two annexes and the house side of the 
capitol it was installed last august after atampt won in a 
competitive bidding process held by the house administration 
committee 
the problems began last week when the system shut down for 
nearly an hour substantial outages have occurred at least three 
times since then and thursdays was the longest yet 
atampt officials met with the chairman of the panels office 
systems subcommittee rep charles rose dnc late thursday 
rose later went to the house floor to implore members to be as 
indulgent and patient as they can and promised that if the system 
isnt working by the july fourth weekend the whole blooming 
thing will be replaced 
ray colley the deputy house clerk said the system is one of 
the largest in the country and the problems are atypical its a 
flukey sort of thing he said were losing a lot of calls 
obviously believe me we have total attention from atampt 
technicians suspected a computer software problem perhaps 
exacerbated by an unusually high volume of calls coming through the 
system but they were examining everything including the 
possibility of computer hackers tampering with the system from 
outside colley said 
congressional offices reported everything from totally dead 
telephones to intermittent service on some lines in some offices 
all the phones suddenly rang at once 
kolbe said the communications glitch reminded him of the atampt 
television commercials showing distraught employees bemoaning their 
choice of a competing phone system and discussing how their 
businesses had been ruined the commercials end by proclaiming atampt 
the right choice 
well in the interest of truth in advertising i think we 
ought to admit that the same source of that advertising is the one 
that has the telephone system here in the house kolbe said 
i dont know what motivated this installation of the new 
system but its certainly proven to be a failure complained 
rep walter jones dnc if alexander graham bell the inventor of 
the telephone had been around the house the past two weeks he 
would have been most depressed and despondent to say nothing of 
being embarrassed jones said 
herb linnen an atampt spokesman said the company was trying to 
replicate the house calling patterns in its denver laboratories to 
help isolate the problem but had been unable so far to do so 
we are totally empathetic with the frustration of lawmakers 
linnen said we are frustrated we have a commitment to get the 
problem fixed as quickly as possible he said

scientists studying the inner ears of birds 
have found a clue that could lead to the possible development of a 
therapy to restore hearing to people who have a deafness caused by 
exposure to loud noises 
in articles published today in science two groups of 
researchers report that both adult quails and young chickens are 
able to regrow cells in the inner ear after their hearing has been 
damaged by acoustic trauma 
the studies suggest that there may be a hormone or protein 
secreted by damaged sensory cells in the ear could cause the growth 
of new replacement cells 
edward w rubel of the university of washington coauthor of a 
study using adult quails said the finding is truly new and 
could eventually be important to some of the 22 million americans 
among them president reagan who suffer from hearing loss 
we have not found a cure for deafness but we have found 
something in the ear of birds that we havent thought possible 
rubel said 
douglas a cotanche an assistant professor at the boston 
university school of medicine and coauthor of a study using young 
chickens said researchers are not yet able to show that the 
regrowth of the cells critical to hearing also occurs in mammals or 
humans 
but cotanche said the findings do offer a theoretical 
possibility of one day correcting a type of deafness in humans 
both of the bird studies centered on an inner ear organ called 
the cochlea a key part of the hearing process the researchers 
discovered that when sensory cells within the bird cochlea are 
destroyed by loud noise some chemical process causes the growth of 
new sensory cells apparently restoring a key link in the hearing 
process 
in the hearing process sound waves cause the ear drum to 
vibrate this vibration is transmitted through bony parts of the 
middle ear to the inner ear where it creates a pressure wave in the 
fluidfilled cochlea microscopic hairs lining the cochlea act as 
sensors to detect this pressure wave and cause nerve signals to be 
sent to the brain which interprets the signals as sound 
intense levels of noise can cause the cochlea hair cells to be 
killed thus lowering the hearing acuity if enough hair cells are 
lost deafness can result 
some people such as reagan can compensate for the hearing loss 
by wearing an electronic aid that amplifies sound 
reagans hearing problems began early in his movie career when 
he was costarring in a crime story film a pistol was fired just 
inches from his ear he later said that the acoustic trauma was so 
great that he almost collapsed the injury severely damaged the 
hearing in one ear but reagans doctor said he wears two aids as 
do many people to achieve a hearing balance 
even hearing aids however are ineffective if enough of the 
hair cells have been killed 
these are the most important cells for hearing and cells that 
we cant replace surgically rubel said 
but the findings in the studies on quails and chickens raise the 
possibility of finding a way to cause the body to stimulate 
regrowth of these hearing cells 
if we can find the protein or the genes that get turned on to 
do this cause hair cell regrowth in birds then we may be able to 
artificially stimulate them in a mammal but thats still far down 
the road cotanche said 
for their independent studies both rubel and cotanche injected 
two groups of laboratory birds with a tracer chemical that marks 
genetic and cellular activity one group of birds in each study was 
then subjected to traumatic levels of sound control groups of 
birds were not exposed to the noise 
later the birds were killed and their hearing organs analyzed 
the scientists by checking for the presence of the tracer 
chemical were able to show that the traumatic sound caused the 
spontaneous growth of replacement hairs cells in the cochleae of 
the birds subjected to the noise birds in the control groups 
showed no such new cell growth 
cotanche was coauthor on the chicken study with jeffrey t 
corwin of the university of hawaii rubels coauthor in his study 
was brenda m ryals of the veterans administration medical center 
in richmond va

midwesterners and southerners can expect heat 
waves and droughts more often because the longdreaded greenhouse 
effect warming of the earth has begun but the current dry hot 
weather cant be specifically tied to the global warming 
scientists told congress 
instead the weather troubles now affecting much of the united 
states could be the result of normal climate fluctuations several 
scientists told the senate energy and natural resources committee 
on thursday 
it is not possible to blame a specific heat wavedrought on 
the greenhouse effect said james hansen climatalogist at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations goddard institute 
for space studies in new york city 
however hansen and other scientists said the current hot dry 
weather is an example of things to come 
the four globally warmest years on record have all fallen in the 
current decade and 1988 is practically certain to break all 
records at close to ninetenths of a degree fahrenheit warmer than 
normal defined as the 19511980 average 
many scientists have said that they believe the longpredicted 
greenhouse effect has begun in the most definite statement yet 
hansen said it has 
global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe 
with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship 
between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming he said 
he said there is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong in 
blaming rising temperatures around the world on the buildup of 
manmade gases in the atmosphere 
syukuro manabe soil specialist at the geophysical fluid 
dynamics laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said the current drought is an example of the 
kind of drought that will occur more frequently as the global 
warming becomes larger 
computer models predict more frequent droughts in the american 
midwest and southeast and the latest models predict a bestguess 
estimate of an increase in global average temperature of about 054 
degrees fahrenheit each decade into the middle of the next century 
temperature increases in high latitudes could be more than 
double that this could mean growing cotton in siberia and oranges 
in british columbia tropical temperatures would hardly change 
although precipitation would increase at high and low latitudes 
the warmer weather would also mean a rise in sea level of about 
a foot which has been about the increase on the us atlantic 
coast over the past century a period in which the average 
temperature worldwide rose about ninetenths of a degree fahrenheit 
hansen earlier had published predictions of what this would mean 
for several cities in terms of the typical number of days each year 
with temperatures above 100 degrees fahrenheit washington 12 
instead of one dallas 78 instead of 19 memphis tenn 42 
instead of four chicago six instead of none 
it reached 101 degrees in washington on wednesday 
the greenhouse effect is the result of gases emitted by modern 
civilization reducing the heat normally radiated by the globe into 
space just as the glass in a greenhouse raises the temperature 
inside 
several gases contribute and last years treaty calling for a 
halving of chlorofluorocarbon emissions should reduce future 
warmings by 10 percent but half the effect is the result of carbon 
dioxide formed in the burning of fossil fuels like coal 
the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 
10 percent since 1958 and 25 percent since about 1790 roughly when 
coalfired steam engines set off the industrial revolution in 
england currently 3 billion tons of carbon are added to the 
atmosphere every year 
reducing emissions by 3 billion tons or 50 percent to 60 percent 
of current levels could stabilize the content of the 
atmosphere said george m woodwell director of the woods hole 
research center in massachusetts it is well within reach no 
question about that 
sen wendell ford dky concerned about his states coal 
industry asked physical chemist william r moomaw of the world 
resources institute a washingtonbased policy research 
organization if technology could reduce the harmful emissions 
moomaw replied i would argue the resource we have in most 
abundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficiently 
at much lower cost than building any form of power generation

surgeon general c everett koop stepping 
beyond his role as a chieftain in the fight against aids and 
smoking says the nation should lend additional emphasis to 
prevention of all diseases 
it is a strange paradox in our health system koop told a 
congressional panel thursday we recognize that the promotion of 
good health and the prevention of disease is the way to go we 
recognize that it is every effective and we recognize that it is 
very cheap 
but we tend not to pay for it 
appearing before the health subcommittee of the joint economic 
committee koop said there are three overarching issues dealing 
with the longrange future of health care in america 
the evolving relationship between technology and health care 
the emerging changes in the way the public relates to organized 
medicine 
the potential changes in how societys values may hamper the 
historic financial support for a broadbased health care system 
he said that americans are preoccupied with health and drawn 
to glamorous hightech solutions 
the things such as prevention of disease promotion of health 
good counseling are very effective very cheap but have no 
glamour whatsoever i think we have to face the fact that you can 
have glamour as long as it is cheap but when glamour gets as 
expensive as it is you have to sort of trim your sails 
on the second point he said the new mobility of american 
society makes it much less likely the average patient will be 
known and served by the same physician and same hospital staff for 
a lifetime 
he said that an estimated 15 million americans have turned to 
selfhelp because they have lost a sense of personal contact with 
doctors and other health professionals 
my only concern and its a major concern is that some 
people who need the help of experts with medical training arent 
getting it or are avoiding it and their health and possibly their 
lives may be in peril as a consequence he said 
a third major concern he said is that the public might seek 
retribution in the future against people with certain illnesses 
that may be associated with lifestyle 
he said the american people are generous in supporting through 
taxes and personal donations the goal of good health for everyone 
in society 
but they can also become impatient he said for example 
most americans disapprove of smoking and would like to see all 
smokers stop hence the nonsmoking public is asking for new 
and stronger state and local laws to curb cigarette smoking in the 
work place and in all public governmental and commercial 
buildings 
calling this an example of public retribution directed against 
smokers koop cautioned that such movements should be kept in 
perspective 
he expressed concern that such trends toward retribution could 
result in a backlash against health care spending on people with 
illnesses that probably could have been prevented with healthier 
lifestyles

a diverse group of business political and 
religious leaders will gather in williamsburg va this weekend to 
celebrate freedom of religion a right guaranteed by the 
constitution that they feel has come on rough times 
the leaders representing catholics jews buddhists mormons 
christian scientists as well as secular institutions will meet in 
the colonial capitol at williamsburg that is where thomas 
jefferson james madison and others first agreed in 1776 that all 
citizens should have the right to freely exercise their religious 
beliefs 
then in ceremonies on saturday morning the leaders will sign a 
charter that reasserts religious freedom and offers some guidelines 
for what the leaders hope will be more constructive debate on 
religious issues organizers from the williamsburg charter 
foundation are expecting about 100 people to put their names on the 
charter 
the rev billy graham will deliver the main address following 
the charter signing others scheduled to make remarks over the 
weekend are camelia sadat daughter of the late egyptian president 
anwar sadat makaziew mandela daughter of south african black 
leader nelson mandela benjamin hooks executive director of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people and 
george gallup jr of the polling firm 
there is no pretense that these people believe the same thing 
whether in politics or religion said robert kramer a spokesman 
for the foundation they are coming together merely to say that 
we all should take a moment to step back from our antagonisms 
were not saying that we have to find some common religion 
that we have to paper over our differences kramer continued 
we are saying that there has to be some common notion of 
responsibility and respect for others you may think the other 
persons beliefs are foolish but you still have to respect that 
persons right to hold them 
that in essence is the message of the charter which has been 
undergoing repeated changes in the past two years 
the version of the charter that will be signed this weekend 
acknowledges continuing differences but warns that religious 
liberty can never be taken for granted it also says if 
religious liberty is neglected all civil liberties will suffer 
were not so much looking for a middle ground as for some 
basis for coexistence so that one group does not fear that the 
expansion of rights to others means fewer rights for themselves 
kramer said 
os guinness executive director of the foundation said it has 
taken two years to overcome the suspicions of many of the religious 
and other leaders who will sign the charter they either feared the 
foundation was promoting some religion or working against religion 
guinness said 
the foundation which goes out of business at the end of the 
year is doing neither he said 
this charter is clear from the beginning that its an 
agreement on how to disagree we are not offering specifics 
guinness said we are trying to offer a way of answering the 
question how do we live with each others differences 
during the weekend colonial williamsburg will offer its usual 
tours of historic buildings but the guides will focus their 
discussions on religious liberty folk singers peter paul and mary 
will perform on saturday and a top us postal official is expected 
to present the first issue of a commemorative stamp honoring the 
bicentennial of virginias ratification of the constitution the 
events will be topped off saturday night with a musical program and 
fireworks

massachusetts gov michael dukakis move to help 
balance his state budget with 115 million in new taxes immediately 
spilled over into the presidential campaign with the campaign of 
republican george bush pouncing on the plan 
in addition to announcing his support of tax measures dukakis 
faced a barrage of questions thursday about an fbi investigation of 
the siting of a massachusetts prison and the indictment of his 
former top education adviser for alleged corruption 
dukakis was heading to the island of nantucket today for a 
fourday vacation 
before traveling to washington for a unity dinner thursday 
night dukakis signed a 40 million state cigarette tax and said he 
supported raising another 75 million by bringing the massachusetts 
tax code in line with federal tax changes 
he downplayed the political ramifications saying his immediate 
concern was to make sure that the states fiscal base is solid 
and strong 
but the bush camp immediately labeled dukakis a taxraiser 
its obvious that his reaction is to tax said bush 
spokeswoman sheila tate instead of cutting spending he raised 
taxes it seems to speak for itself 
dukakis disagreed 
i think the people of this state and the people of this 
country can recognize when someone is talking about fiscal 
responsibility and someone who is doing it dukakis told a 
statehouse news conference 
gov dukakis has balanced nine budgets and is about to balance 
a 10th which stands in stark contrast to eight years of a 
reaganbush administration that has left us with more red ink than 
all the previous administrations combined the dukakis campaign 
said in response to tates remarks 
the massachusetts constitution requires the governor to balance 
the budget although dukakis has twice inherited deficits 
dukakis had to decide by today whether to sign the legislation 
authorizing the 5 percent sales tax on cigarettes and other tobacco 
products the tax is effective in 90 days 
housepassed legislation to raise about 75 million by 
conforming state tax codes with federal tax laws which is awaiting 
approval in the senate would affect about 15 percent of the 
states 4 million taxpayers the coupling tightens exemptions 
for tax shelters and business expenses and would affect mainly the 
wealthy 
dukakis also wants to raise about 16 million by closing a 
corporate tax loophole because revenues have not met projections 
he now favors an 118 billion spending plan some 200 million 
less than his original proposal 
dukakis has said he would raise federal taxes only as a last 
resort seeking first to reduce the deficit by trimming spending 
cutting inflation rates through economic growth and collecting 
unpaid taxes 
the longawaited word on dukakiss position on the tax proposals 
came the same day the fbi said it was conducting a preliminary 
inquiry into plans to build a mediumsecurity prison in rural new 
braintree 
the agency said it was reviewing whether there were possible 
violations of the hobbs act a federal antiracketeering statute 
dukakis is not currently a subject of the investigation the fbi 
said 
opponents of the proposed prison contend the owner of the land 
purchased it after receiving inside information that it was being 
eyed by the state 
the process was as open as it could possibly be dukakis 
said we have very tough procedures for the acquisition of 
property 
also thursday former dukakis education adviser gerard t 
indelicato was accused of larceny and forgery related to his state 
duties indelicato previously pleaded guilty to separate federal 
charges of fraud and conspiracy 
the criminal charges against gerard indelicato are very 
serious more so because they allege a violation of the public 
trust dukakis said i expect every public official who works 
for the commonwealth to meet the highest standards of integrity

in a sudden reversal of policy the justice 
department says people who wear tshirts proclaiming meese is a 
pig will now be allowed into the building 
a bicycle messenger wearing one of the shirts was not permitted 
to make a delivery on the premises earlier this month because he 
was inappropriately attired department spokesman patrick s 
korten said as of the start of business thursday that policy 
stood 
but korten said later in the day that the policy had been 
reversed 
the matter was raised with the attorney general this morning 
and he said from here on out our policy will be that if they want 
to enter the building wearing that sort of tshirt they may 
korten told the washington post 
christopher stalvey who said he was turned away from department 
offices june 10 visited the american civil liberties union this 
week to tell legal director arthur b spitzer about the encounter 
spitzer said the aclu was prepared to bring suit if the policy 
remained in effect it seems like a perfectly clear case of 
discrimination based on the content of the tshirt spitzer told 
the associated press 
the justice department obviously doesnt understand what the 
first amendment is all about spitzer said before the policy 
change if they had a rule that said no tshirts that might be 
an acceptable rule but apparently they have a rule that says no 
tshirts that insult ed meese presumably this guy would have been 
allowed in if he was wearing a tshirt that said reaganbush 
84 
told later about the change of policy spitzer said thats 
great

tracing the sexual contacts of people infected 
with the aids virus can be a tricky but costeffective way to slow 
the spread of the disease as long as health workers dont disclose 
names say authors of a new study 
we tried very hard to develop a positive empathetic and 
compassionate relationship with the people we worked with said 
dr randolph e wykoff coauthor of a study that found 
contacttracing to be worthwhile contrary to the predictions of 
many health officials 
i could see very clearly where this would have been a 
miserable failure if they hadnt trusted us wykoff said of the 
study published in todays journal of the american medical 
association 
the study conducted in a rural south carolina county in 1986 
turned up 82 men and one woman who possibly had been exposed to the 
virus researchers said 
the cost of the tracing worked out to about 105 per person 
tested for aids or 810 for each infected person located thats a 
small price compared with the cost of treating a single case of 
aids which is estimated at between 40000 and 100000 wykoff 
said wednesday 
if we prevented one case at 40000 thats 400 people we can 
educate said wykoff a district director for the south carolina 
department of health and environmental control 
educating and counseling both infected and uninfected people led 
them to greatly reduce the number of their sexual partners as 
shown by a check six months later the researchers said 
after counseling most of the individuals started using condoms 
at least some of the time although none had used them before the 
researchers said 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse shared 
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants 
before or during birth 
the study suggests that at least in rural areas there is a 
sizable population that has not been reached by other education 
efforts wykoff said our study gives a preliminary suggestion 
that we can produce a positive behavior change in this population 
i dont think the study says contacttracing will work 
everywhere or that it will always be effective but it does suggest 
it will work in some communities he said 
but an editorial accompanying the study said contacttracing 
should not become the main weapon against aids although the 
strategy would be appropriate in areas where the disease is less 
common 
if one were to attempt contact tracing for all sexual and 
needlesharing contacts of all persons with hiv aids infection in 
cities like new york or san francisco the costs would be 
enormous drs george w rutherford and jean m woo of the san 
francisco department of public health wrote 
contacttracing has been effective with other sexually 
transmitted diseases but the doctors say aids differs in three 
ways 
the vast majority of aids infections are still undiagnosed so 
contact tracing would reach only a fraction of people affected 
the infection usually causes no symptoms for years making it 
difficult to go back and find sex partners 
no cure exists making it questionable whether any intervention 
is really helpful

the birds landing post office 
named one of the smallest in the nation looks more like a 
sprucedup tool shed than the local outpost of the us postal 
service 
postmaster shirley paolini admits that handling mail for the 24 
folks in town and about 100 families in the surrounding countryside 
doesnt sound like a highpressure job by city standards 
nevertheless paolini says she never has a dull moment 
for me its never boring it can be anything else but its 
never boring you never know what the day is going to bring she 
said 
the post office serves an important function for the farm 
families who have lived in the area for generations and for the 
homesick basque peruvian and mexican sheepherders under contract 
with local ranches 
paolini who lives with her husband in a frame house just behind 
the post office has been postmaster for 20 years in the summer 
she and her husband are joined by their grandson who catches 
turtles in the nearby creek and plays softball in the road 
an american flag and red geraniums grace the front of the post 
office while two friendly old dogs watch the locals trade gossip 
at nearby picnic tables inside a table and two chairs provide 
more opportunity to catch up on town news next door sits a 19th 
century general store 
founded by settler john bird in the 1870s birds landing is 
located south of fairfield in solano county about 20 miles 
northeast of san francisco 
the us postal service announced wednesday that the birds 
landing post office tied with two others in a contest to name the 
nations smallest post office the two others were salvo nc and 
ocholpee fla beating out such places as cut and shoot texas 
smile ky and remote alaska 
candidates for the contest were nominated by the public using a 
point system nominees were compared in such categories as square 
footage local population number of post office boxes and number 
of delivery route stops 
the contest was the brainchild of officials at the postal 
services oakland division which includes birds landing 
contenders had to be freestanding post offices with appointed 
postmasters and their own zip codes 
each town has a cute little story to tell said dan 
demiglio spokesman for the oakland postal division the majority 
of nominating calls came from people who grew up in some 
wonderful small town and remember the way life used to be

the air force is reviewing a proposed 102500 
fine by the nuclear regulatory commission for alleged violations 
associated with a 1986 spill of radioactive powder at an ohio 
military base 
nrc spokesman jan strasma said thursday that it is the first 
time the nrc has ever proposed a fine against the military 
strasma said the proposed fine involving wrightpatterson air 
force base near dayton is for willful failure to report the spill 
within 24 hours and for the internal exposure of an individual to 
the powder 
the failure to report violation is responsible for 100000 of 
the total proposed fine he said 
there was an effort to avoid reporting it to anyone including 
other groups within the air force strasma said 
patti turner spokeswoman for the air force surgeon generals 
office said that the nrc action is being reviewed and a response 
will be filed within 30 days she declined further comment 
no one was injured in the spill of americium241 but a 
radiological safety officer at the base said tests showed he 
inhaled a small quantity of the powder 
wrightpatterson spokesman lt col michael turner said that the 
violation notice was received at the base wednesday afternoon and 
that no decision has been made on whether to pay the fine or 
protest it 
a protest would be evaluated by nrc staff which could then 
modify the proposed fine if a fine is imposed the air force could 
appeal it to an administrative law judge or the atomic licensing 
safety board 
the radioactive powder leaked out of an unlabeled barrel at the 
base in september 1986 while four workers were taking inventory in 
a storage building the powder is not considered dangerous on the 
skin but can cause cancer if swallowed or inhaled experts say 
the workers later washed themselves under a spigot at a boy 
scout camp on the base air force officials say tests show there 
was no contamination there but as a precaution offered to test 
hundreds of boy scouts who had camped there 
wrightpatterson spokeswoman kathy higgins said that none of the 
140 boy scouts and leaders tested so far has tested positive for 
exposure 
the powder allegedly was accepted for storage at the base from a 
jeweler who had used it to change the color of diamonds cleanup of 
the spill cost nearly 1 million 
prosecutors in ohio have been investigating an alleged attempt 
to cover up the spill and a former radiation safety officer at the 
base was indicted by a federal grand jury last may for his role in 
the incident

americas prairie waterfowl their 
numbers already depleted by decades of agricultural development and 
lost habitat are seriously threatened this summer by the worst 
drought since the great depression 
north dakota cited by the agriculture department as suffering 
more from the searing heat than any other state is at the heart of 
the prairie pothole region a 300000squaremile patch of glacial 
gouges that is a critical stop on the central flyway for migrating 
and nesting birds 
in a landscape resembling a vast piece of swiss cheese the 
potholes trap precious fresh water that creates the food and 
shelter for birds trying to reproduce 
about 50 percent of all ducks in north america come from the 
prairie potholes 
but this year because of recordbreaking heat a drastic drop 
in annual rainfall and a barren dry winter the us fish and 
wildlife service estimates the duck population in north dakota is 
down 18 percent from last year and has decreased 22 percent in 
south dakota since 1987 
federal counters estimate north dakota has 24 million ducks 
south dakota about 2 million 
further say fish and wildlife aerial surveyors theres been a 
sharp decline in the number of waterholes available to those birds 
attempting to hatch young 
in north dakota the pond count is down 49 percent from last 
year in south dakota the number of available waterholes has shrunk 
42 percent 
weve put transmitters on about 175 female mallards in north 
dakota and minnesota this season and so far only five have hatched 
broods said gary krapu a federal research biologist at the 
northern prairie wildlife research center in jamestown 
its likely fewer than 20 of those hens will produce broods 
this season 
a brood averages eight to 10 ducklings because of predators and 
a chancey food supply only about half live through their first two 
months 
if the drought lingers and populations continue to decline 
americans can expect to see far fewer waterfowl than they have 
traditionally known krapu said 
birds that flock to prairie pothole country which spans parts 
of north and south dakota minnesota montana and three canadian 
provinces include everything from tiny teals to majestic swans and 
endangered whooping cranes 
among the 119 bird species found in north dakota are seagulls 
from california white pelicans from texas the threatened piping 
plover that has almost vanished from its original great lakes 
range and even swallows from bolivia and upland sandpipers that 
fly all the way from the argentina pampas to nest in the potholes 
but when the birds arrived this year things were different and 
krapu believes they knew it immediately 
i think the birds sensed drought from the beginning krapu 
said in april we had the worst dust storms since the 1930s 
maybe half the birds didnt nest at all and the other half made 
one attempt and gave up 
krapu a native north dakotan is pained by the disappearing 
flocks especially the masses of ducks he remembers from childhood 
to one person seeing two ducks is all they need to see to 
another person seeing 1000 isnt enough said the biologist who 
says hes devoting his life to studying birds 
krapus grandfather was a homesteader in the virgin prairies of 
north dakota shortly after it gained statehood in 1889 
there used to be waterfowl in such numbers that they blackened 
the sky as they flew by said krapu 44 my dad whos 80 this 
year remembers an april sunrise when the whole sky was moving 
north 
that was before the plow before agricultural erosion and 
before 3 million of north dakotas 5 million acres of pothole 
wetlands were drained by farmers 
today only a century after settlement 28 million of the 
states 44 million acres are cropland and there has been a 
drastic decline in just about every bird species thats been coming 
or living here for millions of years before man came krapu said 
ive watched many species of birds pass into oblivion and today 
the duck population is down to a very small part of what it once 
was 
krapu said this years drought the culmination of several 
abnormally dry years is a crushing blow to bird populations 
already severely stressed because of water and food shortages 
we are not facing seeing waterfowl driven to extinction but 
from mans standpoint these birds are an important tradition to 
millions of americans an important symbol of our natural 
resources and a barometer of our overall wildlife situation 
we must wonder whether the birds will be a viable important 
part of our national heritage if the drought continues

in a second round of expulsions for alleged 
spying canada has kicked out a senior soviet diplomat bringing to 
19 the number of soviet officials banned from canada this week 
the soviet union promised to retaliate in a move indicating 
little hope for an end to the titfortat expulsions 
foreign minister joe clark on thursday ordered col grigori 
stepanovich roublev the senior military attache in the soviet 
embassy out of the country by monday 
clark also said sergei mikhailovich kashtanov a former second 
secretary at the embassy who served in canada from 19811985 was 
no longer welcome in canada because of espionage activities 
in addition the total soviet diplomatic contingent in canada 
was cut from 63 to 60 
the move brought to 19 the number of soviet diplomats and 
officials expelled or declared persona non grata since tuesday 
nine have been thrown out and 10 formerly assigned here have been 
told not to come back since canadian authorites announced the 
breakup of a spy ring that was seeking military secrets 
the kremlin retaliated wednesday by expelling two canadian 
diplomats in moscow and banning reentry for three other canadians 
not presently in the country 
soviet embassy spokesman viatcheslav bogdanov termed thursdays 
action indecent revenge and said there is no doubt 
whatsoever that there will be retaliation it is going to happen 
canadian officials accused the soviets of trying to obtain 
highly classified military and civilian technology 
but defense minister perrin beatty denied reports the targets 
included us naval communications and weapons systems made by 
paramax electronics of montreal the company is a subsidiary of 
unisys corp of detroit and a major contractor for new canadian 
frigates under construction 
we have no indication at all of any connection between these 
expulsions and the frigate program beatty said 
disclosure of such naval espionage could be highly embarrassing 
to prime minister brian mulroneys government which has asked the 
united states to approve the transfer of nuclear submarine 
propulsion technology to canada 
canada is currently negotiating the 66 billion purchase of its 
first fleet of eight to 10 nuclearpowered submarines and the 
options include a britishdesigned boat using the us technology 
clark also accused the soviets of trying to infiltrate the royal 
canadian mounted police security service and its successor the 
canadian security intelligence service 
we are confident that canadian security was not compromised 
he told parliament on wednesday he said a soviet translator at the 
international civil aviation organization in montreal yuri smurov 
had defected to canada after providing intelligence on the soviet 
operations 
intelligence service spokesman jerry cummings said the 
expulsions stem from soviet spying operations going back five years 
asked if they were connected with the arrest earlier this month 
of stephen ratkai a canadian of hungarian descent charged with 
trying to pass us military secrets to the soviets cummings said 
he could not comment because the case is before the courts 
cummings said the government did not intend to make the first 
round of expulsions public but the story leaked out during the 
sevennation economic summit in toronto this week 
canada is willing to put the matter behind us if moscow ends 
the retaliation now officials said 
the mass expulsions are the first since 1978 when 13 soviet 
diplomats were sent home for trying to recruit a royal canadian 
mounted police intelligence officer as a double agent 
but that doesnt mean others havent been declared persona 
non grata or expelled since 1978 cummings said

a 44yearold airplane carrying allied ambassadors 
flew from frankfurt to berlin to highlight celebrations marking the 
airlift that fed 2 million city residents during a soviet blockade 
40 years ago 
among the passengers thursday was one of the berlin airlifts 
original pilots dubbed raisin bombers who said that out of 
fairness he droppped candy and raisins to children in both the 
communist and western halves of the city 
the berlin airlift changed this city and it changed the 
world us ambassador richard burt said of the june 
1948september 1949 operation which delivered more than 18 million 
tons of food and vital supplies to berlins alliedcontrolled 
western sectors 
accompanying burt on thursday on the dc3 a civilian version of 
the military c47 transports used during the airlift were british 
ambassador sir christopher mallaby french ambassador serge 
boidevaix and west german defense minister rupert scholz 
longtime berlin resident helga galler 60 was among the 400 
people waiting for the landing at berlins templehof airport she 
said she recalled well the shortages and feelings of hopelessness 
created by the soviet blockade 
everything was in short supply food clothing everything 
mrs galler said so when we saw these planes coming we knew we 
didnt have to worry any longer 
i dont what we would have done without them mrs galler 
said 
at the end of world war ii berlin was divided into soviet 
us british and french sectors the city was surrounded by 
sovietcontrolled territory that later became east germany 
bitter disputes between the kremlin and the united states 
britain and france led to the soviet move to cut all berlin off 
from the west 
specifically soviet leader josef stalin was staunchly against 
the creation of a unified german state in the three western 
occupation zones and when the western allies backed a currency 
reform to speed up germanys economic recovery moscow imposed the 
blockade 
retired air force col gail halvorsen who accompanied the 
ambassadors on the plane was the first to begin dropping raisins 
and candy to berlins children to sweeten the supplies they were 
already receiving 
halvorsen 67 said that once during the airlift days he 
received a letter asking why no candy was dropped over berlins 
eastern sector 
so i flew over east berlin after that and started dropping 
candy there too he said 
but after one such run halvorsen said an officer came up to 
me and asked what i was doing he told me the russians had 
complained that we were trying to influence the thinking of the 
kids over there so i had to stop it halvorsen who was a 
27yearold us army air force lieutenant when he started flying 
berlin airlift missions in july 1948 said he flew a total of 126 
roundtrip missons from july 1948 to february 1949 taking off from 
the us rhine main base near frankfurt 
he later became commander of the us air force at tempelhof air 
base from 1970 to 1974 he has since retired from the military and 
makes his home in provo utah 
halvorsen said he first had his crew throw out candy to children 
waiting at templehof airport 
there were only about 30 kids gathered at the airport on 
that run he said but the idea spread like wildfire and soon 
there were thousands of children throughout the city waiting for 
sweets to be tossed out of airlift planes which were quickly 
dubbed raisin bombers 
when the soviets blocked off allied access to the western 
sectors of berlin in 1948 they also cut delivery of electricity 
and food from berlins communistcontrolled eastern sector 
in response the allies officially announced the berlin airlift 
on june 26 1948 by the time the airlift ended on sept 30 1949 
more than 277000 planeloads of food and supplies had been brought 
to the former german capital

a rearseat passenger restrained only by a lap 
belt is exposed to greater risk of disabling or perhaps fatal 
injury during a car crash than a passenger wearing a 
lapandshoulder belt a privately commissioned study says 
rearseat occupants wearing only lap belts are exposed to 
substantially greater impact forces in the abdominal and lower 
spinal column area than occupants wearing lapshoulder belts the 
study said this greatly increases their risk of sustaining 
severe injuries including disabling or fatal injuries to the 
spinal cord and abdominal organs in such crashes 
the study was released by the institute for injury reduction at 
a hearing on thursday of the house government activities and 
transportation subcommittee the institute based in dunkirk md 
was founded this year by attorneys involved in productinjury 
litigation 
the study was prepared for the institute by automotive safety 
testing inc of east liberty ohio which used instrumented dummies 
belted into the rearseat assembly of a 1987 honda accord lx and 
subjected to simulated crashes 
a simulated crash at 27 mph showed an adultsize dummy pressing 
against the outside part of a lap belt at 2350 pounds per square 
inch 338 percent higher than the pressure recorded when a 
lapandshoulder restraint was used 
the national highway traffic safety administration said the 
study showed a lack of reponsibility toward public safety 
in our opinion it is irresponsible for anybody to discourage 
the wearing of any kind of safety belt said ron de fore nhtsas 
director of public and consumer affairs the department of 
transportation has for years studied hundreds of thousands of fatal 
crashes and our data shows that you have a nine times greater 
chance of being killed in the rear seat without a belt as opposed 
to wearing the belt even if it is a laponly belt 
de fore accused the institute of special pleading the people 
who presented the testimony have an underlying motive by their 
own admission they represent plaintiff attorneys who have clients 
that are among the few that have been injured by the lap belt de 
fore said 
the use of lap belts alone in rear seat became a subject of 
contention among auto regulators with the 1986 release of a 
national transportation safety board study that concluded the belts 
might cause serious injury rather than protecting the passenger 
the highway traffic safety administration has said the 1986 
study was based on insufficient data 
the traffic safety administration and auto manufacturers have 
said a properly adjusted lap belt will provide protection because 
the force of the crash will be absorbed by the large pelvic bones 
a misadjusted belt will result in the belts cutting through the 
soft abdomen to the spinal column studies have shown 
the institutes study did not consider the position of the lap 
belt on the passenger 
virtually all 1990model us cars will have lapshoulder belts 
in the two rearwindow positions said thomas hanna president of 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association which represents the 
automakers 
hanna said that members of the association have designed kits 
for nearly all models made in the last 10 years that allow owners 
to install lapshoulder belt combinations in the back seat of 
vehicles 
the kits however may be difficult to obtain the institute for 
injury reduction said the organization on may 2526 conducted a 
random telephone poll of 30 dealers for five automakers in six 
cities and found none had lapshoulder belt kits in stock 21 said 
no kits were available and only eight said kits could be ordered 
the conclusion is inescapable that manufacturers have 
failed to undertake vigorous production marketing pricing and 
installation programs aimed at substantially increasing the 
availablility of retrofit rearseat lapshoulder belts to american 
car owners said a benjamin kelley the institutes president

republican george bushs campaign immediately branded democrat 
michael dukakis a taxraiser after the massachusetts governor 
backed 115 million in new state taxes dukakis was coping with 
other homestate headaches as well including an fbi probe of his 
administrations selection of a prison site 
bush was flying to cincinnati today for a gop unity conference 
and the republicans were expected to have a field day with dukakis 
tax move several of bushs former rivals for the nomination 
kansas sen bob dole former secretary of state alexander haig and 
christian broadcaster pat robertson were to be on hand for the 
republican event 
dukakis on thursday signed a 40 million state cigarette tax and 
said he supported raising another 75 million by bringing the 
massachusetts tax code in line with federal tax provisions 
the state faces a 400 million deficit in the current fiscal 
year but dukakis defended his ability to manage a budget saying 
it stood in sharp contrast to the record of the reagan 
administration 
the bush camps reaction to dukakis action was swift and a 
bit gleeful 
its obvious that his reaction is to tax said bush 
spokeswoman sheila tate instead of cutting spending he raised 
taxes it seems to speak for itself 
bush has already been getting a lot of campaigntrail mileage 
out of tax issues making frequent reference to taxandspend 
democrats dukakis has said he would raise federal income taxes 
only as a last resort 
the paths of the presidential rivals nearly crossed thursday 
night in washington bush and dukakis posed separately a few 
hours apart for pictures with visiting australian prime minister 
bob hawke 
dukakis was in washington for a democratic fundraiser before 
heading off today for a fourday vacation on the island of 
nantucket in massachusetts 
democrat jesse jackson meanwhile was in puerto rico today the 
islands residents do not vote in the general election but jackson 
was angling for a share of puerto ricos 57 delegates to the 
democratic national convention 
jackson was greeted on his arrival thursday night by the 
territorys governor rafael hernandez colon who said earlier in 
the day that he was considering jacksons request that he be given 
some of the delegates jackson won puerto ricos nonbinding 
primary in march but most of the delegates have said they would 
vote for dukakis at the convention 
the jackson forces are taking a conciliatory approach to 
delegate questions though on thursday democrats agreed to a list 
of delegates to next months national convention 
but jackson has put the dukakis campaign on notice that he 
intends to keep pressing platform demands unacceptable to dukakis 
including a call for new taxes on the wealthy and support for a 
palestinian homeland a democratic committee was convening today in 
denver to continue work on the platform draft 
jackson was also keeping alive the issue of whether he should be 
dukakis running mate hes said he ought to be asked but wont 
say if he actually wants the job 
jackson told reporters in washington on thursday that he has 
made up his mind about whether he wants a spot on the ticket but 
said hes not telling anyone what his private verdict was not 
even dukakis 
that would be public he said 
dukakis has repeatedly said that many people are being 
considered for the no 2 spot and said thursday he wasnt close to 
a decision on a running mate 
youre going to have to wait on that for a while he said 
dukakis spending one last day tending to business before 
beginning his vacation was beset by a series of woes on thursday 
after signing the cigarette tax he brushed aside questions 
about the political repercussions of raising taxes in the midst of 
his presidential campaign saying that his main concern was to 
make sure that the states fiscal base is solid and strong 
the tax action followed a day of questions about a federal 
investigation of the dukakis administrations plan to build a 
prison in the small town of new braintree 
local officials have accused the dukakis administration of 
tailoring a deal on the site because the coowners of the property 
are longtime acquaintances of the governor and one coowner has 
contributed to dukakis presidential campaign 
the fbi which does not usually confirm when a probe is under 
way said it revealed the investigation because of dukakis status 
as a presidential contender the fbi said dukakis was not a target 
of the probe but said the investigation had not reached a stage in 
which subjects would be singled out 
dukakis denied any wrongdoing saying the suggestion that his 
administration had acted improperly was unfortunate and 
regrettable 
also thursday former dukakis education adviser gerard t 
indelicato was accused of larceny and forgery related to his state 
duties he had previously pleaded guilty to separate federal 
charges of fraud and conspiracy 
dukakis called the charges very serious more so because they 
allege a violation of the public trust

tons of rocks and earth tumbling down on a 
mountain village have forced the suspension of rescue work at the 
site of a major landslide that buried at least 100 people alive 
officials said 
radio reports late thursday said villagers heard people crying 
for help from underneath the debris 
the victims including 30 travelers stranded in a coffeehouse by 
an earlier landslide early thursday were buried by the major 
landslide which swept down on catak village thursday afternoon 
according to reports from the northeastern area 
catak is located in trabzon province about 500 miles northeast 
of ankara and not far from the black sea the earth was loosened by 
heavy rains in the region where frequent landslides are sometimes 
blamed on extensive cutting of forests 
provincial deputy gov haydar ozgun said it was feared the death 
toll would be high since so many people were missing rescuers 
hobbled all day by rain had recovered only one body by late 
thursday provincial governor enver hizlan announced 
an announcement over loud speakers by the turkish red crescent 
a relief organization caused panic when it said 300 people had 
been killed the independent hurriyet news agency said officials 
denied that the toll was so high 
state radio reported that at least 31 people were injured in the 
disaster in catak one victim said the landslide came without 
warning thursday 
it happened all at once after a noise that sounded like 
thunder turan alemdar a truck driver who witnessed the 
disaster was quoted as saying by hurriyet the rocks swept away 
everything in a second 
i saw the mountain coming over me and started running away 
zeki ilhan was quoted as saying by the semiofficial anatolia news 
agency 
state radio said villagers reportedly heard people crying for 
help as they lay underneath a mass of earth and stones 
rescue teams put off work until early today after a third 
landslide hit area thursday evening no one was reported buried in 
the new slide which dumped tons of mud and rocks near the village 
ozgun told the associated press by telephone that land slide 
experts had ordered the rescue operations halted for the day 
hizlan said that a german rescue team today will fly in to help 
turkish rescue efforts he said the german team would bring trained 
dogs to help dig out victims 
the mud and rock roared down a mountainside onto at least three 
houses four stores a restaurant a high school and the crowded 
coffeehouse according to news agency reports 
several buses and cars were lined up on the road when the 
landslides hit state radio said 
televised reports said the landslides had also caused a river to 
flood the village footage showed houses under water 
landslides blocked a riverbed and sent the waters coursing 
through the village according to news reports 
the televised reports also showed trees and lampposts lying on 
ground some vehicles were buried in soil 
a survivor wrapped in blankets said on television that he was 
trapped in the coffeehouse but swam out 
rescue workers recovered two minibuses under the wreckage but 
no one was found inside according to news services 
television also showed footage of the village smothered between 
mountains with the roofs of its houses barely protruding from the 
rubble 
the reports said it took about four hours for rescue teams to 
reach the site they said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers tried 
unsuccessfully to push away the mud and stone which covered the 
area they moved slowly for fear of causing new landslides 
buses and vehicles were waiting on road at the time of the slide 
because the highway was closed by the earlier landslide thursday 
shortly after midnight the reports said 
deputy gov erkan isilgan told the associated press that 
authorities were trying to find out whether the buses were carrying 
any foreign tourists 
isilgan said 17 houses in the village were evacuated 
the red crescent sent 150 tents to the area and dispatched a 
mobile hospital according to the news reports 
meanwhile the closure of the highway disrupted traffic in the 
area bus services from eastern provinces to tarbzon province were 
canceled hurriyet said vehicles formed long lines on both sides 
of the highway waiting for bulldozers to clear the road

television stations have been put on notice 
scenes of a barebreasted woman seducing a 15yearold boy are off 
limits on primetime tv 
beyond that though tv stations say they have little to guide 
their programming decisions and protect themselves from government 
sanctions for violating decency standards 
this is a baby step of further information but its not 
enough to provide any cohesive or comprehensive guidelines for 
stations said walt wurfel a spokesman for the national 
association of broadcasters 
the fcc issued the guidance on thursday when it slapped a 
2000 fine on kansas city mo station kzkctv for airing the 
movie private lessons at 8 pm on may 26 1987 a time the 
agency said when children were likely to be watching 
the movie is about a 15yearold boy seduced by his housekeeper 
who undresses while the boy watches in one scene she appears 
barebreasted in several other instances these scenes the fcc 
said were neither isolated nor fleeting 
the commission said nudity and sexual themes are not necessarily 
indecent but their context and treatment in private 
lessons were 
the movie included nudity and scenes depicting sexual matters 
which were dealt with in a pandering and titillating manner the 
fcc said 
the story line of the seduction of a 15yearold boy by an 
older woman together with the inclusion of explicit nudity would 
have commanded the attention of children and the sexual references 
would have been readily understood by children who tuned into the 
program the commission said 
the stations owners media central inc of chattanooga tenn 
said the movie had been cut by an inexperienced editor and violated 
the stations own standards of good taste 
but the kansas city times reported in todays editions that 
media central says it will not pay the 2000 fine 
its a matter of principle morton kent media centrals 
chairman of the board told the newspaper we have the money to 
pay the 2000 fine but we will not 
kent said the fcc ignored the fact that kzkc changed its editing 
policy after the rrated movie was broadcast 
the fccs decency guidelines have been under fire since they 
were adopted in april 1987 broadcasters and others say the 
guidelines are unconstitutionally vague a coalition of these 
groups is challenging the guidelines in court 
the fcc judges material to be indecent if it depicts or 
describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory 
organs or actitivies 
obscene material defined as appealing to prurient interest and 
lacking literary artistic political or scientific value by law 
cannot be aired at any time but the supreme court has said 
indecent material cannot be totally banned the fcc says indecent 
material can be aired after midnight when there is little risk 
children would be watching 
critics have demanded that the fcc give more specific guidance 
about what will be considered indecent but commission lawyers have 
said that providing a list of dos and donts would run afoul of the 
constitution instead the fcc has told broadcasters they should be 
guided by the decisions the agency makes in the cases that come 
before it 
since the fcc revised its decency standards it has acted on 
nine complaints against broadcasters including the one against 
kzkctv at the same time that the fcc revised the standards it 
issued warnings to three radio stations and later dismissed 
complaints against two tv and three radio stations 
the commission has said several times that context is a crucial 
factor in determining whether material is indecent 
in one case the commission dismissed a complaint against a tv 
program on sex education that included a simulated demonstration of 
birth control devices the fcc said that though the program 
contained references to sexual and excretory organs and activities 
the references in context were not vulgar lewd or shocking nor 
were they made in a pandering or titillating manner 
in another case the fcc put a radio stations reading from the 
james joyce classic ulysses in the decent category along 
with the song i want to kiss her but which the commission 
said was capable of two meanings one innocent one sexual 
when the fcc adopted its tougher decency standards in april 
1987 it ruled in a case involving new york disc jockey howard 
stern that use of doubleentendre was indecent when it was mingled 
with explicit references that made the material capable of only a 
sexual meaning

stars and bars may again grace the uniforms of 
chinese soldiers as the government announced today it had set up a 
committee to study restoring ranks to the peoples liberation army 
the late chinese leader mao tsetung abolished ranks more than 
20 years ago calling them a vestige of hierarchical bourgeois 
society 
zhang husheng director of the information bureau of the general 
office of the standing committee of chinas parliament said today 
the committee will also take up proposals to confer medals on 
retired soldiers and confirm ranks held in 195565 before mao did 
away with the system 
zhang was speaking at the first news briefing ever held by the 
standing committee he said it was part of efforts to increase 
openness of government proceedings 
the 155member standing committee handles daytoday affairs of 
the 3000member national peoples congress chinas parliament 
which hold only one session annually the committee is meeting for 
the second time since the seventh plenary session was convened in 
march 
zhang said the agenda will be led by a series of proposals 
submitted by the central military commission headed by senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
among the proposals is one that defines the roles of officers in 
the peoples liberation army 
zhang said military ranks were conducive to commanding and 
control of our army and required by modernization and 
standardization of our army 
deng has repudiated maos concept of an egalitarian proletariat 
army and has sought to bring back ranks as part of efforts to 
create a more modern and efficient fighting force since 1985 
chinas military has been reduced in size from 4 million to 3 
million troops 
the military has also abandoned its old force doctrine of 
peoples war which relied on guerrilla warfare to protect the 
country and embraced military theories closer to those of the west 
it is widely believed that the pla will formally reinstate ranks 
on either aug 1 army day or oct 1 national day 
even though chinese soldiers have been formally without ranks 
for the past two decades they have not been equal generals still 
command and foot soldiers still obey 
in addition even though all military uniforms appear to be the 
same irrespective of a soldiers position subtle differences in 
clothing indicate great differences in power highranking 
officers for example wear wool mao suits in the winter and the 
jackets usually come with four pockets foot soldiers wear cotton 
suits and only get two pockets 
zhang said the standing committee will also discuss such issues 
as the nations financially pinched education system and how to 
improve the work of the national peoples congress and the 
committee 
although chinas policies are still set by the ruling communist 
party the peoples congress in recent years has shed its 
rubberstamp image and become a forum for debate and discussion of 
those policies 
zhang said the standing committee will establish a practice of 
holding news briefings once every two months and will make the 
contents of its meetings as open to the public as possible 
he said the committee also plans to set up a reception room 
where ordinary congress members can come to express opinions

the mighty mississippi drained to an 
alltime low looks like an emptying bathtub receding waters have 
exposed cracked river banks and beachlike expanses where barges 
sit mired their crews restlessly hoping for an unlikely rain 
were stuck on this thing said johnny bryson 35 pilot of 
one of 56 towboats parked thursday along a 40mile stretch of idle 
river around memphis thats all everybody talks about the 
river the low water no rain 
the crews stalled by the worst drought in half a century are 
swabbing decks changing engine oil and finding other ways to kill 
time until the river is navigable again 
a few miles north of here a dredge worked around the clock to 
deepen a channel that was 6 inches shallower than the 9foot depth 
guaranteed by the army corps of engineers a 35foot scoop that 
looks like a dustpan scrapes a sand shoal at a rate that could 
deepen a football field by 9 feet a day 
the coast guard hoped to have the channel open this afternoon 
freeing the 22 southbound tows and 34 northbound boats that had 
lined up by 7 pm thursday the river was shut to commercial 
traffic tuesday night 
normally 30 to 50 towboats moving barges of wheat corn coal 
petroleum steel bauxite chemicals auto parts cement and other 
bulk goods churn past memphis each day 
the cargo floats on a natural interstate highway that is a 
lifeline to the nation it would take 27000 trucks to haul the 
tonnage pushed past memphis in a day 
these days however the mississippi is at its lowest level 
since records were first kept in 1872 receding waters have left 
beachlike expanses of sand bars and stone dykes used to control 
channel flow and river banks baked by the relentless sun show 
deep dry cracks 
the only things moving on the brown waters thursday were 
pleasure craft and fishing boats 
the charlotte and its five metal barges which shimmered with 
griddlelike heat waves in broiling 100degree heat was bound for 
st louis from beaumont texas the river traffic jam could extend 
add a week to the 14day trip 
its ok to break for a day or so said engineer darrell 
eriest 32 of harned ky then everybody gets anxious 
theres an old saying out here that a towboat never stops but 
its always stopping were used to hurrying up and then waiting 
its part of the game eriest said 
eriest spent the day changing oil on the main engines greasing 
the rudders and cleaning engine filters 
when the boat shuts down thats when my work starts he 
said 
one problem for boats arriving at the bottleneck was finding a 
spot to tie off the water has dropped so low that sturdy trees are 
more than 1000 feet from the water 
hardmuscled rivermen most with tanned and leathery skin are 
used to seeing the big muddy blocked from time to time by 
accidents barges running aground or ice packs but the worst 
drought in 50 years has brought record low water and the dry 
months of july and august are still to come 
whats got everybody shook up is its happening early in the 
year before the dry months theres no end in sight said dl 
carroll 58 captain of the arnold sobel which is carrying 
fertlizer 
carroll used the dead time to have an abcessed tooth pulled in 
memphis he also radioed his home office in st louis jokingly 
asking them to send rain gear 
wed all rather be under way time passes better when the 
engines are running carroll said but there are still things 
to be done 
depending on which company they work for river crews work 30 
days then get 15 or 30 days off if the boat shuts down they 
still get paid from 57 to 200 a day depending on whether they 
are a deckhand or a captain 
in a way its easy money there really isnt that much to 
do said stuart mill 27 an assistant engineer from daytona 
beach fla 
modern towboats bear little resemblance to the steamdriven 
paddlewheelers of mark twains time when memphis was built on a 
bluff to accommodate the cotton and riverboat trade 
the arnold sobel is like a floating motel complete with air 
conditioners private rooms and a laundry on board for a crew of 
nine are five television sets and one videocasette recorder the 
better to pass the time on idle days the carpeted guest room has a 
private lounge and brass beds 
the boat is pushing 23 barges from new orleans to hartford 
ill a trip that usually takes 10 days thursday was the ninth day 
of the journey and only its halfway point 
aint no use being in a hurry said robert patterson 48 a 
mate from arlington ky if it dont rain there aint going to 
be no grain to ship anyhow

three huge gasoline tanks exploded 
thursday at a depot in this northeastern industrial city killing 
at least two people and starting a blaze too hot for firefighters 
to approach officials said 
twenty people were hospitalized with burns including six in 
very serious condition officials said 
several vehicles parked near the tanks turned to molten metal 
and the temperature near the fire at times reached 5400 degrees 
said nuevo leon state judiciary police director hernan guajardo 
garza who visited the site 
two workers died from burns at the san rafael tank farm owned by 
the government petroleum monopoly pemex said raul de la garza 
nuevo leon press secretary de la garza earlier had said four 
workers died but later corrected the figure citing his latest 
information 
pemex spokesman guillermo guevara at a press conference with de 
la garza said firefighters managed to extinguish the flames in two 
of the tanks around 1130 pm edt and said they expected the 
blaze in the third tank to be put out early monday 
de la garza said 10000 people were evacuated from their homes 
around the tank farm in case the flames spread 
about 200 amy infantry troops cordoned off the area to prevent 
looting and the government news agency notimex quoted police as 
saying 40 people found loitering around evacuated houses were 
detained for questioning 
federal and state police blocked access roads to guadalupe 
creating traffic jams around the greater monterrey metropolitan 
area 
the three tanks exploded one after another starting at about 3 
pm 5 pm edt at 930 pm 1130 pm edt the fire was 
still out of control and a reddish glow could be seen 10 miles away 
flames shot up more than 100 feet in the air and palls of smoke 
about 1000 feet high rising from the three burning tanks 
guadalupe is just outside monterrey mexicos industrial center 
and its third largest city with a population of about 2 million 
both cities are about 440 miles northeast of mexico city 
firefighters at the tank farm said intense heat prevented them 
from approaching the three tanks to pour in chemicals to control 
the blaze authorities said they used 50foot pipes that can eject 
chemical foam at a great distance to put out fires at two of the 
tanks 
the special equipment was flown in from the gulf of mexico port 
of ciudad madero 280 miles southeast of guadalupe 
the san rafael complex has 23 tanks of about 55000 barrels 
capacity each where pemex stores gasoline and diesel oil for 
retail distribution in monterrey and other parts of northeastern 
mexico 
guillermo guevara a pemex spokesman said in a telephone 
interview the three tanks were full of lowgrade 81octane 
gasoline he said the other tanks contained highergrade 90octane 
gasoline and diesel oil mostly used by trucks 
were trying to control the fire and allow the gasoline to be 
consumed naturally gasoline is very flammable it burns 
easily we dont know why the explosions occurred we cant get 
close enough to investigate because its too hot guevara added 
fire brigades were also rushed to the scene from dozens of 
industrial plants in monterrey including private companies the 
monterrey airport other pemex facilities in the area and the 
nearby pemex refinery at cadereyta 
guevara said a total of 226 million gallons of liquid fuel was 
stored at the tank farm 
he said 250 pemex workers are employed at the tank farm but 
added he did not immediately know how many were at the site when 
the explosions occurred 
four pemex workers were hospitalized with second and 
thirddegree burns on more than 50 percent of their bodies and two 
others were hospitalized with lesser injuries guevara said 
natalia palacios who lives about four blocks southeast of the 
tank farm said se took her family of eight including an uncle and 
aunt out of their home and rushed them to a friends home farther 
away where they planned to spend the night 
mrs palacios said her husband works at another pemex plant 
an explosion and fire may 24 at pemexs gas and kerosene supply 
depot in the northern city of chihuahua caused the evacuation of 
more than 100000 residents according to the chihuahua state 
government 
pemexs preliminary report on that disaster found that a spark 
during the installation of firefighting equipment touched off the 
blaze

a federal judges dismissal of a damage suit 
accusing 29 people of running a gunsfordrugs smuggling scheme to 
aid the contra rebels was angrily denounced by stunned plaintiffs 
as a political move 
but one of the defendants who included former cia officials 
contra leaders and cocaine traffickers said the 24 million 
lawsuit was itself a political attack on the reagan administration 
and probable republican presidential nominee george bush 
im very pleased retired maj gen john k singlaub a key 
figure in the irancontra scandal said following thursdays 
ruling i think the case is 100 percent political 
chief us district judge james lawrence kings ruling also 
cleared irancontra figures richard secord and albert hakim former 
cia deputy director of operations theodore shackley contra leader 
adolfo calero and leaders of colombias violent medellin cartel 
in granting summary judgments to the defendants king found that 
the plaintiffs two journalists had failed to prove their case 
christic institute attorney daniel sheehan whose liberal 
washingtonbased organization represented the plaintiffs accused 
king of political motivations in his ruling and said he would 
appeal to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
the judges action is a conscious action to stop this case 
from going to trial before the election said sheehan the 
court has defied the law not just mistaken the law 
sheehan and the plaintiffs said they were stunned the judges 
ruling came only a few days before the trial was to start monday 
tony avirgan who filed the suit with his wife martha honey 
after being wounded in a 1984 bombing blamed on the defendants 
reacted angrily to the decision 
i think its absolutely absurd that the judge has said we 
dont have enough evidence avirgan said in a telephone interview 
from his costa rican home all the key defendants have refused to 
take depositions walked out on depositions refused to turn over 
documents and hes refused to take sanctions against them 
king ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove their basic contention 
that a wideranging conspiracy was behind the news conference 
bombing in nicaragua that injured avirgan eight people were killed 
but the apparent target contra leader eden pastora was only 
wounded 
the judge also ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove the 
defendants were responsible for threats to news sources and the 
journalists aimed at covering up the defendants involvement 
singlaub who said he spent 250000 on his defense and 
shackley promised retaliatory legal action against the christic 
institute 
singlaub and calero said the motive for the suit was to attack 
the administration and vice president george bush before the 
november election and to punish those who helped the contras 
the suit was filed in may 1986 six months before the 
irancontra affair became public many of the people it brought to 
light have been indicted or appeared before congressional 
committees investigating that case 
it alleged the defendants belonged to a rightwing terror 
network dating back to 1959 that illegally participated in 
assassination plots gun running and drug trafficking 
the suit accused the defendants of funding illegal contra 
activities with drug runs in cooperation with the medellin cartel 
and threatening imprisoning and even killing anyone who threatened 
to uncover the ring 
other wellknown defendants included cartel leaders pablo 
escobar gaviria and jorge ochoa vasquez irancontra figure robert 
owen costa rican rancher john hull and former mercenary sam hall 
hall had been ordered jailed during the trial after refusing to 
answer questions in a deposition but apparently will not have to 
serve the sentence

the attorneys general of 47 states 59 us 
senators and 112 house members are asking the supreme court to 
leave intact a 1976 civil rights ruling that they say is the 
armor in the battle against prejudice 
the officials joined by a coalition of civil rights groups and 
other organizations said on thursday that reversal of the 
12yearold ruling would send the signal that discrimination is 
tolerable in american society 
justice department officials meanwhile said that the reagan 
administration will sit out the controversy and will not offer its 
views by filing a friendofthecourt brief 
at issue is the courts announcement last april that it will 
consider overturning a decision that allows people to sue private 
citizens accused of racial discrimination 
a decision is expected sometime in 1989 
the extraordinary move no one had asked the court to overturn 
the ruling was taken by a 54 vote and the four dissenters 
accused the court of undermining the trust of minorities 
critics said mere consideration of such a move could have a 
major psychological impact on minorities raising fears that an 
increasingly solidified conservative majority on the court is 
willing to consider dismantling other civil rights victories 
the court in april said it will use a north carolina case 
involving charges of onthejob racial harassment to reconsider a 
decision called runyon vs mccrary 
in the 1976 ruling the court said racially segregated private 
schools that refuse to admit black students violate the civil 
rights act of 1866 a law enacted to ensure recently freed slaves 
all the rights of citizenship 
the 1976 decision let civil rights groups use the law as a 
weapon in attacking private discrimination 
if runyon vs mccrary is overturned no federal law would ban 
racially segregated private schools 
also civil rights activists say a major deterrent to racial 
bias in employment would be lost because the 1866 law is the only 
one that allows victims of illegal discrimination to collect hefty 
punitivedamages awards 
more than 100 civil rights and public interest groups joined in 
urging the justices on thursday to leave the 1976 ruling intact 
among the groups signing the brief were the american civil 
liberties union the aflcio the southern christian leadership 
conference the national organization for women and the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
the unprecedented number of groups signing onto this brief is 
indicative of the concern that the courts action has caused 
said ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights 
for the millions of americans for whom civil rights is not 
just an abstract legal principle but rather armor in the battle 
against prejudice the courts decision to overturn runyon would be 
a direct assault neas said 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said 
lawyers in the north carolina case were informed by letter 
wednesday that the justice department wont be filing in the 
case 
she said the brief letter did not give specific reasons for 
solicitor general charles frieds decision not to file a brief

a local florist who paid 2000 to bring a 
sioux indian medicine man to dance and pray for rain in the 
droughtstricken midwest says the showers were brief but the money 
was well spent 
cliff doebel said thursday he was pleased with the attention 
leonard crow dogs ceremony drew to the drought and its effect on 
the states agriculture economy 
people around the world need to know that this year we may not 
be able to supply the grain we usually supply he said 
crow dog used an eagle bone whistle and a peace pipe at the 
30minute ceremony sunday when he guaranteed that the 
droughtstricken northwest ohio town would receive rain by thursday 
the medicine man who said the ritual always brings rain blew 
the whistle toward the north south east and west and then toward 
the sky and ground 
the showers arrived ahead of schedule wednesday night as a cold 
front moved through the state the national weather service does 
not have an official rainfall monitor in clyde but precipitation 
in nearby communities ranged from 22 inches in fremont to 08 
inches in milan forecaster matthew peroutka said 
its not enough and the situation is still here and still 
severe but i think it was enough to help some of the corn out 
doebel said 
doebel said he wasnt sure whether to credit crow dog or just 
luck 
im not one to know those answers he said all i know is 
you flip a coin and sometimes it comes up heads

opponents of president kurt waldheim of 
austria are using pope john paul iis second visit to this country 
to demonstrate against the controversial president 
five hours before the pope arrived at viennas schwechat airport 
on thursday a group of six jews from the united states led by 
rabbi avi weiss of riverdale ny demonstrated outside waldheims 
office 
they told reporters the popes meeting with waldheim on thursday 
evening constituted a desecration of the memory of those jews and 
christians who were murdered at the former nazi concentration 
camp at mauthausen 
jewish leaders have harshly criticized the pope for meeting 
waldheim 
elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress 
in new york said late thursday that the popes meeting with 
waldheim has thrown into doubt the longplanned meeting between the 
vatican and jewish groups on the holocaust 
waldheim has been the focus of international controversy 
concerning his service in the balkans during world war ii as a 
soldier in the german army 
he has denied any wrongdoing 
do not embrace waldheim no said rabbi weiss as he stood 
outside the presidential offices in downtown vienna 
standing with rabbi weiss were five jewish students dressed in 
black and white striped garb like those worn by nazi concentration 
camp inmates they held up posters including a blown up photograph 
of waldheim in a germam army uniform 
later rabbi weiss and his associates were joined by parisbased 
nazi hunter beate klarsfeld and a group of ten jews from france at 
a hotel overlooking st stephens cathedral 
as the pontiff entered the cathedral they unfurled banners from 
windows overlooking the church one said pope john paul dont 
meet waldheim 
austrian police stormed the rooms and one demonstrator was hit 
when he refused to turn over his poster ayall schanzer chairman 
of the new yorkbased north american jewish students network 
said no arrests were made 
its unbelievable klarsfeld said i think its a lack of 
sensitivity toward the holocaust 
weiss who heads a group called the coalition of concern said 
his organization also objects to the planned papal visit to the 
former mauthausen concentration camp today a day after the pope 
met with waldheim 
about 110000 prisoners died in the camp and weiss said after 
the pope leaves the site of the former camp his group plans to 
resanctify the camp and recite prayers 
about 100 young austrians belonging to the new austria group 
of intellectuals who oppose waldheim staged an antiwaldheim 
demonstration near the hofburg palace at 600 pm thursday one 
hour before the pope met waldheim there 
the demonstrators tried to approach the palace but were 
prevented by police who posted dozens of guards in the area

scriptwriters voted overwhelmingly 
to continue their 4monthold strike threatening the fall tv 
schedule and prompting layoffs and angry promises from both sides 
not to compromise 
members of the writers guild of america voted 2789to933 or 
75 percent to 25 percent to reject the latest contract offer by 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers the union 
announced thursday 
with the exception of the few shows whose producers signed 
contracts independent of the alliance virtually all fall tv 
entertainment programming is threatened by the strike the 
exceptions include the cosby show and the tonight show with 
johnny carson 
the alliance reacted to the results of wednesday nights vote by 
saying it had nothing further to negotiate with the guild leaders 
promised to push forward with television programming where 
possible and to begin layoffs where necessary 
its disastrous for the entire business said paul junger 
witt a guild member and coexecutive producer of the golden 
girls and beauty and the beast 
layoff notices were issued almost simultaneously with the 
announcement of the voting results at universal studios a memo 
went out to employees thursday announcing that the commissary would 
close today and more layoffs are planned 
its devastating said dan slusser senior vice president 
and general manager of universal city studios inc weve already 
made a number of cutbacks in the tv and studio operations group 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg said the guild vote was 
emotional rather than a serious appraisal of the offer 
but union officials said producers stubbornness caused the 
strong rejection 
the message to the companies is loud and clear said mona 
mangan executive director of the writers guild east our 
members want a contract that resolves the key issues of the strike 
if the companies end their inflexibility which forced the 
strike and prolonged it we can end this strike quickly and put 
everyone in our industry back to work she said 
meanwhile late night with david letterman head writer steve 
odonnell said thursday the talk show which has been in reruns 
because of the strike will return to live telecast tuesday night 
odonnell said the show is seeking a waiver contract with the 
guild but will resume without its writers if approval isnt 
granted by then he said the writers were supporting letterman 
members of the 9500member guild went on strike march 7 over 
the issues of residual payments for onehour shows and programs 
broadcast in foreign markets 
producers say their fouryear contract offer would be worth an 
extra 71 million to writers and includes an acrosstheboard 
increase in residuals of 147 percent payments to writers now 
total about 360 million a year steinberg said 
the guild contends its negotiators accepted a flexible formula 
for payment on onehour televison shows sold for reruns but was not 
rewarded with a more generous offer for shows sold overseas the 
union has linked the two items in an economic package 
the guild said 104 independent waiver contracts have been 
signed but alliance officials contend most of those are small 
producers with little impact on the industry

federal officials say they believe health care 
workers are heeding a set of recommended precautions designed to 
protect them from potentially dangerous viruses including the one 
that causes aids 
the recommendations dealing with patients body fluids were 
published last august and in response to numerous questions from 
health care workers across the country clarified and updated in a 
report issued thursday by the centers for disease control 
officials at the atlantabased cdc said the questions and other 
signs indicate that people are paying attention to the 
recommendations 
we have not done any formal study however from what we hear 
health care workers are being more careful said julia s garner 
the cdcs chief of prevention activity 
use of protective gloves by health care workers the main 
emphasis of the cdc report has increased to the point where there 
is a shortage of the gloves officials said 
ms garner said it was not clear how much can be attributed to 
the governments recommendations and how much is simply the result 
of generally heightened awareness of the aids epidemic 
in addition more care apparently is being taken in the disposal 
of needles and other sharp objects which ms garner said is a 
serious threat to transmit human immunodeficiency virus the virus 
that causes aids and hepatitis b virus 
the cdc recommends that needles scalpels and other sharper 
objects that come in contact with blood and other potentially 
dangerous body fluids be disposed of in punctureresistant 
containers 
four years ago it was not unusual to see used needles in 
cardboard boxes used to store supplies ms garner said 
the 1987 report was updated to be more specific about what types 
of fluids health care workers must protect themselves from and to 
apply the precautions to hepatitis b as well as hiv ms garner 
said officials also wanted to quell rumors that a certain type of 
medical glove was inadequate 
gloves should be used whenever an individual might come in 
contact with a patients blood the updated report said other 
universal precautions such as gowns masks and protective 
eyewear also are advised 
blood is the single most important source of hiv hepatitis 
b and other diseasecausing microorganisms and viruses the cdc 
said 
universal precautions also apply to tissues semen vaginal 
secretions cerebrospinal fluid synovial fluid pleural fluid 
peritoneal fluid pericardial fluid and amniotic fluid the cdc 
said 
feces nasal secretions sputum sweat tears urine and 
vomitus do not require universal precautions the cdc said unless 
they contain visible blood 
breast milk though it has been implicated in the prenatal 
transmission of hiv and hepatitis b virus does not require the 
high degree of precaution for health care workers the cdc said 
however those who have frequent exposure to breast milk should 
consider wearing gloves 
gloves are not needed when feeding patients or wiping saliva 
from skin the cdc said though gloves and handwashing are 
recommended for such practices as digital examination of mucous 
membranes

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk said today he will take part in peace talks with 
vietnamese officials next month but expressed doubt about hanois 
planned withdrawal of troops from cambodia 
im in favor of dialogue i am not mr nyet i am mr da im 
not going to say no to anybody sihanouk said at beijings 
airport 
he left today for bangkok to attend a meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the association of southeast asian nations asean a 
principal backer of the threeparty antivietnam coalition that 
sihanouk heads he is also likely to meet secretary of state george 
shultz who will be in bangkok for the conference 
sihanouk said he will say always yes to all proposals that 
would lead to a settlement of the cambodian conflict and called 
plans for informal peace talks to be held next month in jakarta a 
good thing 
vietnam has said it will also attend the cocktail party 
talks in jakarta 
i am interested in solving the problem of kampuchea so with or 
without the vietnamese in jakarta im going to attend he said 
the composition of the participants has no importance 
the cocktail party would bring together for the first time 
the rival factions of the threeparty resistance representatives 
from vietnam and from the hanoiinstalled cambodian government 
sihanouk also said he was willing to meet with cambodian prime 
minister hun sen he broke off talks with hun sen in paris earlier 
this year accusing him of being a puppet of the vietnamese 
i will talk to the vietnamese to hun sen to everybody 
sihanouk said the most important thing is to start the process 
of examining the problem and trying to exchange views and having 
discussion 
the resistance coalition made up of sihanouk the communist 
khmer rouge and the noncommunist forces of son sann is calling 
for the withdrawal of vietnamese troops that have occupied cambodia 
since late 1978 the group also wants the formation of a fourparty 
government that would include hun sen 
vietnam has said that it will pull out 50000 troops this year 
and the remainder of its estimated force of 120000 by 1990 but 
sihanouk said he feared the troops would only be rotated 
i dont believe it is true he said that must be rather a 
rotation of troops rather than a genuine withdrawal the vietnamese 
cannot afford to withdraw because the hun sen regime would 
collapse 
vietnams pullout which is to begin this month has renewed 
concern about the return of the communist khmer rouge which killed 
a million or more people before being ousted by hanoi 
sihanouk denied western news reports that china had offered to 
give asylum to khmer rouge leader pol pot in an attempt to help 
solve the cambodian conflict 
china on thursday called the reports highly irresponsible 
and absolutely groundless

after 26 years of buddhist passivity 
and private grumbling opponents of burmas authoritarian regime 
are taking to the streets in violent protest 
since october students have mobilized demonstrations three 
times causing deaths mass arrests and long university closures 
nine people were killed this week in the latest ongoing street 
confrontations in rangoon the burmese capital officials said 
the students are demanding release of detainees and legalization 
of their unions 
however western diplomats in rangoon and knowledgeable burmese 
observers say the outbursts reflect deeprooted disillusionment 
with a regime that has monopolized power for a quarter century 
during that time it has led the resourcerich southeast asian 
nation to economic ruin and isolation 
in an unprecedented admission of failure strongman u ne win 
last year called on the state to pinpoint the disease and 
lifted controls on the vital rice trade there was also talk of 
constitutional change but little to indicate ne wins party would 
throw out the basic tenants of his rule rigid socialist economics 
isolationism and singleparty control backed by the powerful 
military 
no real reform has yet been made although there has been some 
smallscale tinkering with the economy wrote a leading american 
burma scholar josef silverstein recently the economys 
downward spiral remains unchecked 
despite the unprecedented surge of opposition there have been 
no predictions so far that anything but old age or ill health will 
topple the 78yearold leader 
while ordinary citizens have joined students in some 
demonstrations there has been no sign of a meaningful and 
organized opposition to ne win among the military bureaucracy or 
influential buddhist monkhood 
the activist students themselves have shown little evidence of 
planning and coordination although the rangooncentered protests 
have been touching off minor disturbances elsewhere in the country 
ne win who came to power in a 1962 military coup has in the 
past systematically rooted out opponents and dealt harshly with the 
few open protests he faced rarely seen in public and never 
interviewed by the press ne win is said to be a superb and highly 
intelligent political infighter and a strong nationalist 
but beyond a neutralist foreign policy that has paid dividends 
his overall record as national leader is badly marred 
he has lost whatever lingering support he may have had people 
now realize the government has never had their interests in mind 
said one western diplomat in rangoon last year he made the comment 
after the government took about 60 percent of the kyat currency out 
of circulation without explanation or compensation 
burmese in the streets talked of official robbery angry 
students spilled out of their campuses in the first rioting since 
1974 
analysts regarded the reaction to the demonetization as a 
watershed event 
it coincided with a nosedive of the already weak economy that 
continues even now 
once the worlds largest rice exporter and an oil producer 
burma has suffered spot food shortages and has had to import 
petroleum products regarded as potentially the richest nations in 
southeast asia because of its vast natural resources burma with 
a per capita annual income of less than 200 ranks among the 
worlds ten poorest nations 
although the state officially controls much of the economy a 
black market actually accounts for twothirds or more of the 
transactions the government must spend a third of its budget on 
fighting a welter of ethnic minorities seeking autonomy and another 
big chunk on servicing a foreign debt of about 35 billion dollars 
observers have long said that one lid on protest in burma was 
its fertile soil and a low population currently about 38 million 
another widely accepted theory was that burmas deeply rooted 
buddhism fostered an acceptance of suffering as ones karma or 
fate and deference to authority figures 
a final factor may be burmas stateimposed isolation from much 
of the world with few real friends and no real enemies outside 
pressures for change have been minimal

the defense has subpoenaed us attorney general 
edwin meese iii as a witness in the wedtech corp corruption trial 
of rep mario biaggi and six others 
although meese was served with the subpoena thursday it is up 
to the judge presiding over biaggis racketeering trial whether the 
attorney general will be required to testify 
a justice department spokesman in washington patrick korten 
confirmed that meese had been subpoenaed and that the us 
attorneys office in manhattan would argue today or monday against 
requiring meese to appear 
there is no testimony that the attorney general can provide 
that is relevant said korten 
biaggi his eldest son and five others are accused of turning 
wedtech a nowbankrupt defense contractor into a racketeering 
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to secure 
nobid government contracts 
wedtech grew from a small machine shop in the impoverished south 
bronx into a 100millionayear business through a series of 
nobid contracts set aside for companies controlled by minority 
group members 
prosecutors charge biaggi and the other defendants helped 
wedtech obtain those contracts through bribery and fraud and then 
allegedly extorted 5 percent of wedtechs stock as payment 
the defense has maintained that corrupt wedtech officials had 
numerous connections with reagan administration insiders like 
meese meeses former personal lawyer e robert wallach and former 
white house aide lyn nofziger 
with friends like that in a republican administration the 
defense claims there was simply no logical reason to bribe mario 
biaggi a bronx democrat for help in obtaining government 
contracts 
dominic amorosa attorney for biaggis son richard claimed the 
testimony of meese and a former meese aide will establish that it 
was they and others and not richard biaggi and his father who 
corruptly acted on behalf of wedtech 
in a letter to us district judge constance baker motley on 
monday amorosa sought her approval for testimony by meese and 
james jenkins a former meese aide when he was presidential 
counsel jenkins was subpoenaed wednesday night at his carmichael 
calif home 
jenkins chaired a crucial 1982 white house meeting on wedtechs 
problems in securing a 32 million nobid army engine contract 
wedtech got the contract several months later jenkins left the 
white house in 1984 and became a consultant for wedtech in 1985 
korten said meese had but one thing that he did and that is 
that he asked that they wedtech officials be given a fair 
hearing by the army 
meese who has been under fire from members of congress for his 
legal difficulties and beset by the resignations of several key 
aides has not been charged with any wrongdoing concerning wedtech

5400 degrees burned out of control today after three gas tanks 
exploded killing two people in this northeastern industrial city

officials said the heat of the blaze melted several cars and the 
fires glow could be seen up to 10 miles away 
the blasts and the fire also injured 20 people authorities said 
six of them were in very serious condition early today 
the blaze started after three tanks exploded one after another 
at the san rafael tank farm belonging to pemex the state petroleum 
monopoly 
the flames shooting more than 100 feet in the air forced the 
evacuation of more than 10000 people from nearby homes 
nuevo leon state judiciary police director hernan guajardo 
garza who visited the site said at times the fire reached 5400 
degrees fahrenheit or 3000 degrees celsius and turned several 
nearby vehicles into molten metal 
firemen rushed in from all around the area were finally able 
to douse the flames in two tanks late thursday using special 
equipment with 50foot pipes that can shoot chemical foam at a 
great distance a third tanks continued to burn 
the equipment was flown in from ciudad madero 280 miles away on 
the gulf of mexico coast pemex spokesman guillermo guevara said 
he said firemen expected to control the flames in the third tank 
early today 
guevara and nuevo leon state press secretary raul de la garza 
who spoke at a joint news conference thursday night in monterrey 
said there were no immediate clues as to what started the fire on 
the 23tank farm but that an investigation was under way 
the private television network televisa quoted pemex officials 
as saying the explosions and fire were caused by stray sparks from 
welding equipment being used nearby 
an explosion and fire may 24 at pemexs gas and kerosene supply 
depot in the northern city of chihuahua was blamed on a spark set 
off during the installation of firefighting equipment no one was 
hurt then but more than 100000 people were forced to evacuate 
their homes for a day 
guevara said the 23 tanks were loaded with a total of 226 
million gallons of gasoline and diesel oil when thursdays disaster 
occurred 
the tankfarm employing 250 workers is used as a retail 
distribution center for monterrey and the northeastern region 
monterrey is the countrys third largest city with a metropolitan 
population of 28 million people and one of its main industrial 
centers 
the explosion and fire set off panic among residents of 
guadalupe a small city on monterreys outskirts about 440 miles 
north of mexico city 
people fled their homes even before the state government ordered 
the area evacuated at midafternoon thursday about 10 government 
and private shelters were packed with an estimated 8000 people who 
spent the night there some looking for lost relatives 
raquel garcia monrial 35 begged for help finding her 
7yearold daughter 
we heard the explosion and ran from the house she said 
with tears streaming down her checks searching through one shelter 
the street was full of people and my daughter got away from 
me ms garcia said it was terrible people were screaming and 
crying the flames were so big 
antonio bernal 36 searched frantically through an auditorium 
packed with about 300 people at the guadalupe exposition grounds 
i cant find my son hes 10 years old he said all the 
children were in the house and i guess he ran out it was pure 
panic 
people left their houses wide open and just ran he added 
the state integral family development agency brought in 
emergency shipments of food and blankets at several locations but 
one director said the organizations main job was to help family 
members locate each other 
the people are very disoriented said yolanda elizondo de 
lopez guadalupe the agency president at one place we have 200 
names of missing people 
people rested on the floor on blankets or lined up for plates of 
sandwiches rice and beans at the guadalupe shelter 
tomorrow im going to go stay with some friends but right 
now i just dont feel like going anywhere were pretty nervous 
said celia mendoza who sat on the floor holding her two small boys 
ms mendoza said she was on a bus near the plant when the 
explosion occurred people were climbing all over each other to 
get out it was a mess she said 
about 200 army infantry soldiers cordoned off a fivemile area 
around the tank farm police patrolling inside detained 40 people 
for questioning after they were found loitering near the evacuated 
homes the government news agency notimex said

a jailhouse lawyer tried to prove that he 
died on the operating table during openheart surgery and 
therefore completed his life sentence for murder but a 
disbelieving judge ordered him back to prison 
law is interesting cayuga county judge peter corning said 
trying to suppress a smile after hearing convict jerry rosenbergs 
argument thursday 
corning ruled that rosenberg 49 did not meet the court of 
appeals 1984 definition of death a lack of brain activity or an 
irreversible halt in heart and lung activity 
as his presence in this courtroom indicates he did not 
die corning said 
rosenberg who has earned several law degrees from 
correspondence schools during his 25 years in prison said before 
the ruling that he planned to appeal if he lost after the 
decision guards from auburn correctional facility escorted him 
from the courtroom 
rosenberg contended that he died when his heart stopped during 
the 1986 bypass operation doctors restarted his heart 
he tried to convince corning that the definition of death was 
ambiguous and that there were two kinds of death reversible and 
irreversible 
the higher courts the supreme court has never defined death 
theyve defined life rosenberg said before a crowded courtroom 
reversible death which is a medical term means they bring you 
back from death to life not life to life 
however assistant attorney general ken goldman presented 
affidavits countering rosenbergs claim from three doctors 
including dr leslie kohman who operated on the convict 
having a patients heart stop during a bypass operation does not 
represent an untoward occurence kohman wrote 
corning asked rosenberg if he believed that everyone whose heart 
stopped during heart surgery should be considered legally dead 
rosenberg said yes 
the judge said that under rosenbergs theory everyone who has 
heart surgery could collect on his or her life insurance policy be 
declared divorced and have estates probated 
yes yes said rosenberg i know this is farreaching and 
im opening up a can of not worms but boa constrictors 
rosenberg was convicted in 1963 of murder in the killing of two 
police officers in new york city and was sentenced to death but 
managed to find a legal loophole and have his sentence commuted to 
life 
while in prison he has filed lawsuits ranging from a successful 
appeal for a mafia kingpin to a child custody request for a fellow 
convict 
rosenberg has another lawsuit pending in federal court in 
syracuse in which he claims hes being denied proper medical 
treatment and access to the media

forty liberal lawmakers from the governing 
nationalist party proposed today that taiwan improve its almost 
nonexistent relations with communist china 
the legislators who were elected delegates to upcoming party 
congress in july issued a statement urging the nationalist party 
to map out a positive and forwardlooking policy toward china 
it said the nationalist party or kuomintang should adopt an 
open and realistic attitude to promote more exchanges and 
contacts with china 
the nationalists have refused all official contact with the 
rival communist government in beijing since 1949 when they fled to 
taiwan after losing a civil war on the chinese mainland both 
governments claim to be the rightful ruler of both taiwan and the 
chinese mainland 
last year the nationalists lifted a ban on travel to china to 
allow family reunions the partys policymaking central standing 
committee proposed last week to allow mainland chinese studying 
overseas to visit taiwan but ruled out cultural and athletic 
exchanges with china 
the legislators demanded that the party allow the 1200 party 
delegates to decide on a new policy toward china rather than 
rubberstamping a resolution made by the central standing 
committee 
the statement urged the government to also allow sightseeing 
cultural and athletic exchanges 
we should open up gradually the statement said the next 
phase of development should depend on how the chinese communists 
respond to taiwans relaxation of its policy 
the nationalist government wants china to promise that it wont 
use force to unite the two and stop isolating the island 
diplomatically 
taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with 22 countries and has 
withdrawn from most international organizations because of chinas 
objection 
in a related development taiwan announced today that it had 
rejected a request by a staterun research group to attend an 
international science meeting in beijing 
foreign ministry spokesman chen yuchu told a press conference 
that the cabinet would not allow academia sinica of taiwan to send 
a delegation to the 22nd annual meeting of the international 
council of scientific unions in september

zapping freshly laundered underpants in 
the microwave may prevent the recurring yeast infections that 
plague millions of women researchers say 
a fiveminute microwave treatment at high power kills the fungus 
that causes vaginal infections in 20 million women yearly said 
byron j masterson chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the 
university of florida 
the underwear must be cotton and still damp he warned not 
your fredericks of hollywood nono masterson said the 
bunny suits would probably go kaboom in your microwave 
yeast infections can cause irritation and discharge 
the study was published recently in the journal of reproductive 
medicine 
previous studies have found that yeast or candida albicans 
survives laundering in detergent even in hot water thats because 
candida is killed at 154 to 163 degrees while household water 
heaters are set at about 120 degrees 
undergarments are contaminated and regular washing doesnt 
seem to kill it raymond kaufman an obstetriciangynecologist at 
baylor college of medicine in houston said thursday he did not 
take part in the university of florida study 
most people carry candida its a very common organism most 
women who develop vaginal infections can be treated very 
effectively with drugs 80 percent of the time kaufman said 
but youve got a percentage who keep getting reinfected over 
and over we see this commonly in diabetic women or those whose 
immune systems are below par 
other studies have shown that boiling underpants kills the 
yeast but how many women do you know are going to boil their 
underwear masterson asked

administration acted improperly in selecting a prison site in a 
small massachusetts town is unfortunate and regrettable 
and dukakis administration officials are questioning whether 
political motivations lay behind the revelation that the fbi is 
looking into the selection process in publicly acknowledging the 
probe the fbi broke its usual policy of neither confirming nor 
denying the existence of investigations 
a bureau spokesman in washington bill carter said thursday the 
reason for the exception was that this case could appear to 
implicate a presidential candidate dukakis is all but assured the 
democratic presidential nomination 
the bureau released a statement saying dukakis was not the 
subject of the probe but spokeswoman sue schnitzer added that the 
inquiry has yet to reach the stage where any individual would be 
identified as a subject of investigation 
bureau spokesmen declined to say whether any information 
implicating dukakis had been discovered dukakis said no 
administration official has been contacted or subpoenaed by the fbi 
some residents of the town of new braintree have accused dukakis 
of cronyism in his support for purchasing land there for the 
prison the governor told reporters thursday that his 
administration had been as open as it could possibly be about 
the prison controversy 
any suggestions that the secretary of human services and his 
staff proceeded other than in accordance with the law and strict 
standards of integrity are unfortunate and regrettable dukakis 
told reporters 
dukakis administration officials on thursday questioned whether 
the reagan administration might have engineered publicity over the 
probe the first report of which appeared thursday in the 
washington times 
i think its very curious said john devillars a top 
dukakis aide adding i would certainly be interested in what 
us attorney frank mcnamara has to say 
mcnamara a former republican candidate for congress is a 
reagan appointee he declined comment on the probe on thursday 
those who accuse the dukakis administration of tailoring a deal 
on the prison site point to the fact that the coowners of the 
782acre property are longtime acquaintances of the governor and 
one coowner has contributed to dukakis presidential campaign 
a norwood mass development firm owned by daniel striar and 
gary jacobson purchased the land from the seventhday adventist 
church in december 1985 for 3 million jacobson was a boyhood 
neighbor of dukakis 
dukakis said he was unaware who owned the land at the time he 
approved it as a prison site 
but the boston globe reported in todays editions that 
selectwoman dorothea thomasvitrac a member the governing board of 
new braintree said dukakis was told the names of the people who 
owned the land at a meeting with town residents in the governors 
office may 6 1986 
jacobson and striar purchased the land a month after the state 
listed the land as a possible prison site a later statefunded 
appraisal of the property in 1986 valued the land at 87 million 
that appraisal led critics of the plan to complain that the site 
owners were going to make millions dukakis said thursday that the 
state would release its final appraisal of the land in the next 10 
days and hinted it would be considerably less than 87 million 
in february 1987 jacobson and striar offered to sell the land 
to the state for 95 million more than three times the purchase 
price 
jacobson has been a contributor to dukakis political campaigns 
he and his wife each contributed 1000 to dukakis presidential 
campaign this year the maximum allowed by law 
a secretary said jacobson a physician was seeing patients and 
was unable to return a reporters phone call striar is on vacation 
and could not be reached 
new braintree has a population of 800 the 22 million prison 
would hold 500 inmates 
dukakis has been dogged by opponents of the prison plan while 
campaigning for the democratic nomination residents have held 
protests and lobbied lawmakers against the prison proposal 
thomasvitrac one the strongest opponents to the prison said 
she has been questioned at least twice by fbi agents beginning last 
march the selectmen have been independently seeking a probe first 
with the state attorney general and last march with the us 
attorney 
thomasvitrac said she has turned over to the fbi a box of 
documents relating to the case she has received through requests 
under the freedom of information act documents relating to the 
prison site 
but the dukakis administration has refused to release two 
documents she wants one is an october 1986 memo to dukakis chief 
legal counsel stephen rosenfeld from an aide the day before the 
adventists announced that striar and jacobson were potential buyers 
of the property another dated dec 2 1985 were sent from 
rosenfeld to dukakis the day before the actual sale of the property 
an index of documents released by the administration indicated 
the author recipient and subject of the memos 
there are some documents in this administration we dont 
release publicly on grounds of executive privilege dukakis said

student protesters abandoned burmas 
holiest buddhist shrine its trustees said but authorities kept 
guard around the reopened complex and other major temples in the 
capital today 
the heightened security culminated a week of tension and 
studentled rioting officials said nine people died in street 
violence and the government has imposed a dusktodawn curfew 
closed institutions of higher learning and prohibited all public 
meetings 
buddhist pilgrims reported thursday that students had moved into 
the sprawling hilltop shwedagon pagoda a centuriesold marvel of 
golden spires and stupas to set up a strike center that would 
coordinate antigovernment protests 
however pilgrims who entered the pagoda after it was reopened 
today said they found no trace of student demonstrators 
pagoda trustees who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
university students arrived in groups at the shrine on wednesday 
afternoon and probably mingled with worshippers before the 600 
pm government curfew 
the students were also said to have left later that day though 
it was not clear whether they too were observing the curfew or 
departed for some other reason 
the trustees said security officials searched the temple grounds 
wednesday night and barred public access thursday 
the weeks protests have also caused classes to be suspended at 
schools in mandalay the countrys second largest city 
antigovernment protests have also been reported in pegu north of 
rangoon and in moulmein on the southeastern seacoast 
since october the 26yearold regime of strongman u ne win has 
been rocked by three violent protests in rangoon and smaller ones 
in other parts of the country 
diplomatic and other sources says lack of personal freedoms and 
a downward spiraling economy are fueling unrest 
buddhist pagodas in burma have traditionally been centers of 
political protest in 1920 rangoon students moved into the 
shwedagon grounds to launch agitation against the british who were 
then the colonial rulers in burma 
the posting of guards at sule botataung and other shrines today 
was viewed as a measure to prevent activists from entering the 
buddhist holy places where violence of any kind is forbidden 
traffic increased in rangoon today and all markets were open 
although fewer shoppers were seen 
last week students at several institutions had peacefully 
demonstrated for release of detained students and legalization of 
student unions violence broke out after the government responded 
by closing the schools 
on tuesday about 5000 students and other protesters fought 
police with stones 
last march police and military units brutally suppressed a 
similar demonstration arresting hundreds and killing what western 
diplomats put at possibly up to 100 protesters

foreign secetary sir geoffrey howe denounced any 
bargain for release of british hostages in lebanon while a middle 
eastern newspaper said it had obtained reports that those captives 
would soon be freed 
howe spoke thursday amid rising hopes that a recent series of 
contacts between britain and iran could lead to the early return of 
a british diplomat to tehran and negotiations for the british 
hostages 
but he told the association of american correspondents that this 
weeks private visit of four british lawmakers to tehran had not 
changed britains policicies toward iran or the hostages 
the parliamentary delegation the first to visit iran since the 
1979 revolution said wednesday that iran had agreed to use its 
influence to try to obtain the release of the british hostages the 
delegation urged britain to post a diplomat to tehran 
meanwhile the alkhaleej newspaper in sharjah united arab 
emirates reported thursday that church of england envoy terry 
waite and some other hostages held in lebanon have been taken to 
iran where they will be freed soon 
the publication which is usually reliable quoted informed 
lebanese sources in its frontpage report which said the other 
hostages involved are believed to be british too 
the daily said waite and the other hostages were moved from 
their kidnappers hideouts in the shiite moslemdominated slums of 
south beirut by iranian revolutionary guards last month 
the guards had been fighting alongside guerrillas of the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god against the syrianbacked 
shiite amal militia 
they left south beirut under the ceasefire brokered by syria 
and iran that ended three weeks of fierce fighting alkhaleej 
reported 
it said the guards took waite and the other captives first to 
the syrian capital of damascus and then to tehran 
it was not clear whether the syrians were aware the hostages 
were being moved 
the daily said the captives are expected to be released within 
the coming few days 
however other reports have said the hostages are held in a 
hezbollah barracks ringed by syrian troops in south beirut 
mohammad akhoond zadeh basti irans charge daffaires in 
london said wednesday night he was very optimistic that the 
improvement in diplomatic relations could lead to the release of 
waite journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan 
but howe said britains relations with iran remained at a very 
low ebb because of the shameful way in which british diplomat 
edward chaplin was abducted and beaten by iranian agents in tehran 
may 28 1987 britain reduced its ties with iran to a caretaker 
status following the incident and ordered its diplomats home 
the foreign secretary stressed that the parliamentary mission 
was organized by archbishop of canterbury robert runcie of the 
church of england not the government 
waite mccarthy and keenan are among 18 foreign hostages held in 
lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was abducted march 16 
1985 
france and iran named ambassadors to each others countries 
thursday one week after restoring diplomatic relations the 
appointments were linked to the return of the last three french 
hostages from lebanon

lawmakers are debating whether following the 
letter of the constitution as it concerns the 1990 census may 
result in a system that is unfair to citizens 
this is a fairness issue said rep thomas j ridge rpa 
at a census subcommittee hearing on thursday 
ridge and others argued that illegal aliens should not be 
included in the 1990 count because states will large numbers of 
illegal aliens would benefit unfairly when their large population 
totals give them extra seats in the house 
every census since the constitution was adopted has counted 
all residents of the states including both legal and illegal 
alienssaid rep don edwards dcalif 
house and other political districts are redrawn every ten years 
on the basis of the census and because there is a 435seat limit in 
the house when one state gains a member another must lose one

despite the highly publicized cases that youre all aware of 
i submit that the courts in this country are grossly undercovered

district attorney or a spokesperson to come to deliver or get 
their story for them 
i would find that day after day i was the only reporter in

actor paul newman and delicatessen 
owner julius gold both say they believe jurors were leaning in 
their favor before golds lawsuit against newman came to an abrupt 
end with a mistrial 
but several jurors said they werent even close to a decision 
and predicted that if the case hadnt ended in a mistrial thursday 
there would have been a hung jury 
gold who owns a deli in nearby westport is seeking stock in 
newmans food company newmans own inc claiming he helped 
develop newmans products and is partly responsible for their 
success

mayeran 
mayeran and another juror timothy morris said there was a 
possibility of a hung jury if the trial hadnt ended 
bridgeport superior court judge howard zoarski declared the 
mistrial after jurors sent a note saying they couldnt ignore 
depositions that werent admitted as evidence but were 
inadvertently turned over to them wednesday the second day of 
deliberations 
zoarskis ruling reversed one he made minutes earlier 
instructing jurors to disregard copies of the depositions from gold 
and others involved in the case 
the note delivered to the judge said some members do not feel 
an unbiased opinion can be rendered in light of their reading of an 
amount of the depositions 
zoarski said he had no choice but to order a mistrial 
afterward newman standing in the courthouse lobby thanked 
jurors for their efforts the westport resident called the mistrial 
a terrible unfortunate circumstance adding that i always 
thought this case had no merit and mr gold did not have a case 
newman said he was ready for another trial and gold vowed to 
continue pursuing the lawsuit he filed five years ago 
attorneys for newman indicated they would file a motion asking 
the judge to decide the case in their favor there was no immediate 
indication from zoarski as to how the case eventually would be 
resolved

extremely disappointed by the mistrial after spending more than 
three weeks on the case

received depositions from gold and some of the defendants and 
wanted to see newmans 
newmans attorney w patrick ryan said wednesday it appeared 
the clerk who took the exhibits into the jury room also 
inadvertently took the depositions

of the stock from newmans own inc gold said he contributed 30 
months of effort to the company 
newmans own whose products include spaghetti sauce lemonade 
and popcorn has donated 15 million in profits to charity since

as ambulances their sirens wailing raced to evacuate casualties 
arafats loyalists dislodged mousas followers from the two 
camps in previous rounds of fighting the fatahuprising fighters 
have regrouped along the syriancontrolled edges of the shantytowns 
and launched a series of abortive attacks to regain lost territory 
the police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said the tiny camp of chatilla took the brunt of the 
fatahuprising shelling from positions in syrianpoliced west 
beirut 
it appears they mousas forces are trying to demolish what 
is left of chatilla the spokesman said

israel and syrianbacked shiite moslem militias beginning in 1982 
the fighting raged despite a libyanbrokered truce announced in

mediation 
they are massacring our people he added speaking on 
condition of anonymity

clashes at the two camps to sabotage syrias role in order to 
be acceptable to america

reconciliation meeting between arafat and syrian president hafez

a veteran 911 emergency dispatcher has been 
suspended for a delay in reporting to patrol officers a frantic 
call from a woman facing an assailant who then shot and killed her 
police said thursday that it took officers 38 minutes to respond 
to an emergency call from the woman she was shot while phoning a 
second time for help 
the average time for a dispatcher to send an emergency call to a 
radio car is 35 minutes but in this case the dispatcher took 
almost 20 minutes to alert a patrol car after a police operator 
told the dispatcher of the call said police spokeswoman alice 
mcgillion 
carol kudelycz 24 of queens was shot to death shortly after 11 
pm tuesday 23 minutes after she first called the police 
emergency number a police operator heard ms kudelycz scream and 
then heard a gunshot 
officers arrived 15 minutes after the shooting according to 
police records 
investigators today said they were looking for her former 
boyfriend for questioning he had been free on 5000 bail while 
awaiting trial on charges of having tried to set ms kudelycz on 
fire in march 
during her first call to police ms kudelycz reported that a 
man who was trying to kill her and who had already tried once 
before was ringing her doorbell ms mcgillion said 
the dispatcher cloria washington 32 who worked for the police 
emergency phone system for seven years was suspended without pay 
and will face a departmental hearing ms mcgillion said 
the department also will discipline the operator who took ms 
kudelycz first call because he failed to include information about 
the past attempt on the womans life when forwarding the call to 
ms washington the spokeswoman said 
that operator whose name was not released will face 
departmental charges and will be reassigned and retrained 
according to ms mcgillion

heatsensitive phosphorus inside a derailed 
csx tanker reignited as workers righted it spewing more toxic 
smoke a day after 15000 people were evacuated from eight western 
kentucky counties authorities said 
thursday nights cloud however was not as severe as the one 
the previous night which forced one of the largest evacuations in 
the states history officials said there were no reported 
injuries from the second fire 
only about 60 families living within three miles of the 
derailment were evacuated after the chemical reignited said don 
armstrong a spokesman for the state division of disaster and 
emergency services 
by midnight it was determined that the problem was getting 
less and not greater said armstrong theyre letting it burn 
out this morning 
theres just a small fire this morning and very little of the 
chemical left in the tank said shirley arnold a state police 
dispatcher police units remained at the scene throughout the night 
to keep sightseers away 
the tanker was part of a csx transportation corp train that 
officials say was going too fast through rural christian county 
when 34 of its cars derailed in a ravine 
the new cloud 100 yards wide and 400 feet high was moving 
southeast armstrong said 
greg powell of the us environmental protection agencys 
atlanta office said the danger appeared minimal nobody was hurt 
when the train caught fire again armstrong said 
officials said they believe that once the second fire is out all 
of the phosphorus will have been consumed 
earlier thursday officials said the crew of the freight train 
that derailed wednesday might have avoided the accident had it seen 
a 10 mph speed limit sign 
the speed limit was posted because of a problem with the track 
at the point where the train derailed the train was traveling 35 
mph said tim hensley a spokesman for csx transportation corp 
this probably is a factor but we are not saying that this is 
a cause hensley said and it has not been developed whether it 
was human error on the part of the crew or whether they were not 
provided with the information with regards to that slow order 
hensley said the track was found to be in good condition when it 
was inspected last month he said the safety order was issued 
because of a oneblocklong stretch of rough track possibly caused 
by heat extension of the rails 
where theres a curve it will cause them to move to the 
outside and form a kink he said 
the phosphorus which can ignite spontaneously in high 
temperatures spilled from the ruptured 33000gallon tanker and 
burned in 99degree heat for more than 12 hours after the wednesday 
night crash

reagan said stennis led some of the most crucial legislative 
battles in history on behalf of our nations defense 
the president told of going to see stennis at walter reed army 
medical center after stennis left leg was removed in a cancer

next addition to the nations nuclearpowered carrier fleet

1947 he has served longer than any other senator in history except 
the late democratic sen carl hayden of arizona 
sen sam nunn dga who succeeded stennis as chairman of the 
armed services committee said in introducing the president it 
is hard for me to imagine the senate of the united states next 
january without john stennis at its helm 
stennis speaking from his seat said the speakers who had 
praised him were truly expressing their interest in and respect 
for the free government that we have 
i am not entitled to as much credit as my friends have given 
me tonight he said i was just trying to do what looked to be 
my duty and kept up the best i could

swarms of locusts migrating from northwest africa 
will threaten the food supply in the subsahara region and could 
reach the red sea united nations officials said today 
there is actually little hope of being able to contain the 
plague in the near future the directorgeneral of the un food 
and agriculture organization edouard saouma said in a statement 
he added that the invasion is of unprecedented dimensions and 
will affect the food security of 15 african countries from the 
atlantic ocean to the red sea 
dr lukas brader head of the emergency center for locust 
operations at fao said the locusts moved south in april and may 
earlier than expected because plentiful rains there resulted in 
favorable breeding and living conditions 
he said the situation will worsen during the next few weeks as 
new swarms arrive coinciding with the harvest in the sahel the 
area that extends from senegal to the sudan and separates the arid 
sahara from tropical west africa 
brader said countries in this region face a potential loss of 1 
million tons of grains about 300 million worth of food aid would 
be required to make up for the destroyed crops he said 
united nations experts have said a swarm covering just half a 
square mile can contain 50 million insects weigh 100 tons and eat 
its weight in vegetation each day 
brader said that morocco algeria and tunisia which were first 
infested with the locusts had succeeded in keeping the locusts 
south of the atlas mountains in relatively uncultivated areas 
he added that since the beginning of 1988 123 million acres in 
those countries and mauritania have been treated with pesticides 
in the sahel locust control is more difficult because the 
insects are more dispersed 
saouma said in his statement that locust swarms were sighted in 
sudan this week and that it must now be feared the plague will 
extend to the red sea where it may invade the arabian peninsula 
and the horn of africa 
if unchecked the swarms eventually could reach israel and 
turkey as well as the indian subcontinent 
authorities try to control locusts mainly by spraying pesticides 
the fight has cost 45 million since the beginning of 1988 and 
fao estimates a total of 150 million may be needed for the year 
the last major invasion of locusts in africa began in 1950 and 
lasted for 13 years brader said the current invasion is the 
biggest plague history recalls

unknown gender adult humpbacks reach 50 feet in length 
by photographing the whales flukes tail we fingerprinted 
it he said

markings on the underside of the flukes he said theyre 
distinctive enough markings that we can see them their whole 
lives

west coast of canada and the united states but individual 
humpbacks occasionally stray into puget sound during the winter 
breeding season they frequent waters around hawaii and mexico

the senate today condemned the use of nerve 
gas in the iraniraq war and urged president reagan to pursue 
aggressively an international agreement to ban production and 
stockpiling of all chemical weapons 
on a 910 vote the senate adopted a resolution noting a united 
nations finding that iraq has used chemical weapons several times 
during the war and citing reports that iran retaliated in kind 
the resolution specifically cited a march 16 attack in which an 
estimated 2000 kurds were gassed to death on iraqi soil by iraq in 
an effort to regain control of an iranianocuppied villate 
this is a grave violation of international law said sen 
george mitchell dmaine chief sponsor of the resolution unless 
both sides forgo use of chemical weapons there could be an even 
more alarming esclation of the nearly 8yearold gulf war 
mitchell noted that a 1925 geneva agreement outlaws use of 
chemical weapons but does not bar their production or stockpiling 
the united nations has never invoked sanctions of any sort 
against a violator of the geneva protocol he said 
the resolution calls on the president to seek allied 
cooperation to further tighten controls on the export of chemical 
compounds to countries seeking to develop a chemicalweapons 
capability 
it urges the president to pursue american efforts at the 
geneva conference on disarmament to reach an armscontrol agreement 
banning the use production development stockpiling transfer and 
acquisition of chemical weapons 
either we can sit around and wait for the inevitable said 
sen mark hatfield rore or we can actively and aggressively 
pursue an agreement today that seeks to prevent that next attack

a government official said today that 
he will recommend that the united nations lease desert islands so 
that vietnamese boat people have a place to live 
thirteen thousand of these islands abound in indonesia and it 
is possible they can be converted into profitable farming areas 
said somporn klinpongsa deputy permanent secretary of the interior 
ministry 
somporn said the island rentals could solve the problem of what 
to do with the increasing number of vietnamese seeking asylum 
when the leases expire say in 10 years the people must 
return to their homeland he told the associated press 
somporn said he would seek endorsement of the proposal from the 
un high commissioner for refugees jeanpierre hocke at an 
annual refugee conference in geneva beginning june 29 
somporn said the islandsforrent idea gained widespread 
acceptance during a recent tour he took of southeast asian nations 
many of the boat people are farmers and they should be 
encouraged to grow sugarcane and rubber on the islands he said 
thailand and other southeast asian countries regard a large 
majority of the recent vietnamese fleeing their homeland as 
economic migrants rather than genuine refugees 
the united nations said that as of march 31 it was handling 
about 40000 vietnamese refugees in asia up from 32000 two years 
ago the largest numbers are found in thailand hong kong

a judge who ordered a political 
consultant to make classroom appearances and a public service ad on 
voting said he wanted the sentence to serve as a warning to others 
who contemplate tampering with the system 
a jury ordered 7600 in fines and a year on probation for rocky 
mountain who was convicted of 38 misdemeanor forgery charges for 
instructing workers to put phony signatures on petitions that got 
former delaware gov pete du pont on the states republican 
presidential primary ballot in march 
southern political consulting inc of which mountain is vice 
president was ordered to pay 38000 in fines 
harris county judge sherman ross added to the sentence ordering 
mountain to talk to two civics classes a week for a year on the 
topic the political process and how to make it work right and 
prepare a public service announcement about the value of the 
right to vote 
ross also ordered mountain to finish college he must take six 
hours of spanish to do that 
i hope this message rolls like thunder across the country that 
at the grassroots level the most important level of politics we 
have to maintain the integrity of the system ross told the 
political consultant thursday 
mountain faced a maximum punishment of one year in jail and 
76000 in fines the company faced a maximum fine of 380000 
defense lawyers said the convictions might be appealed 
after the trial kevin burnette the companys president 
reiterated his claim that his houstonbased firm was the victim of 
selective prosecution because it is disliked by state gop officials 
we reacted very stupidly to a very stupid rule he said of 
the petition rule in effect for the presidential primary 
gop candidates had to submit 5000 signatures to get on the 
ballot that rule has since been changed to allow a 5000 filing 
fee instead 
mountain 27 testified tuesday that he ordered the forgeries 
because he had been pressured by a du pont campaign official he 
said he never intended for the du pont campaign to submit them 
but after the punishment was announced mountain said i dont 
believe i was guilty of a crime but i accept the verdict of the 
jury 
of the probation conditions set by ross mountain said if 
this thing isnt overruled and if i have to as a condition of 
probation go out and talk to civics classes ill look forward to 
doing that in the long run that will probably help business more 
than anything else

the fish and wildlife service said today it 
plans to cancel or restrict the special early hunting season for 
the bluewinged teal in 18 states and two other jurisdictions 
because of the drought 
the action could be only the first of new hunting restrictions 
this fall the service has warned 
this species of duck whose migration south begins well before 
others has been hunted for a few days in september for the past 18 
years last year the season was nine days in september in most 
states that had one 
populations of the bluewinged teal total about 36 million this 
year compared with a normal 48 million the service has called the 
prospects for breeding this year grim because of the loss of 
marshy areas in the great plains of the united states and canada 
frank dunkle director of the service has accepted a staff 
recommendation made earlier in the week to propose cancelling the 
season in alabama arkansas indiana illinois louisiana 
mississippi missouri ohio texas colorado oklahoma kansas and 
new mexico 
a similar season in iowa legally not limited to the bluewinged 
teal but in practice dominated by it also should not be held 
according to the proposal 
bag limit reductions shorter seasons or both will be proposed 
for bluewinged teal and some other species in some cases all 
ducks for florida kentucky tennessee alaska puerto rico and 
the virgin islands 
loss of habitat from drought and other causes led the service to 
adopt hunting restrictions in 1985 aimed at reducing the annual 
harvest by hunters by 25 percent dunkle has warned there will be a 
hard look at the regulations this summer 
todays action will be proposed for public comment and should be 
adopted by july 18 said spokeswoman meagan durham 
regularseason regulations generally taking effect in october 
are not adopted until august

catholic bishops gathered today for a 
national conference on such issues as womens concerns in the 
church and society and disagreements about a statement on the use 
of condoms to stop the spread of aids 
more than 250 bishops from across the country were expected at 
st johns university for the fourth meeting in six years of the 
national conference of catholic bishops 
the rev george speltz former bishop for the st cloud area and 
a spokesman for the diocese said he thinks the pastoral on women 
will generate the most discussion followed by a proposed statement 
on the morality of nuclear deterrence and the aids issue which 
will be debated behind closed doors monday 
i think they will be rather heavy discussions because theyre 
all sensitive issues speltz said 
the report on the morality of us nuclear policy is the result 
of two years of work by a bishops committee commissioned as a 
followup to their 1983 peace pastoral the committee is 
recommending that its conditional acceptance of nuclear 
deterrence be retained according to a preconference news release 
speltz said he doesnt think the position of the original 
document will be altered after talks on the new report 
he said conditional acceptance could be viewed as a 
psychological deterrence to nuclear war i have always felt its 
like bluffing in poker he said 
some people speltz said will find the first draft of the 
womens pastoral inadequate because it doesnt discuss ordaining 
women to the priesthood but that issue wont come up 
the holy father said there is no possibility of it and the 
us church does not want to contradict that he said 
the draft calls sexism a sin asks that key church positions 
excluding ordination be open to women urges an end to the economic 
inequities women suffer and says men need to be more responsible in 
marriage and family relationships 
the closeddoor discussion on aids is a followup to decembers 
dispute about a statement in a paper that discussed church policy 
on aids the paper mentioned the use of condoms in public education 
programs as a way of stemming the spread of the deadly disease 
some bishops feared the statement would be misinterpreted as 
condoning sex outside of marriage and the use of artificial birth 
control which the catholic church opposes 
in other business the bishops will 
consider proposals to join a new interfaith cable tv venture or 
work more closely with the eternal word television network 
vote on a proposal outlining conditions for the use of general 
absolution or forgiveness of a group of penitents without 
individual confessions 
adopt a formula for distributing money raised in a new national 
collection beginning this december to meet the retirement needs of 
religious communities 
update bylaws for the national conference of catholic bishops 
and the us catholic conference

the supreme court said today its famous 
miranda ruling is sufficient to protect the rights of criminal 
defendants questioned by police after they are indicted or 
otherwise formally charged 
the justices voting 54 to uphold an illinois mans murder 
conviction said the warnings police have given suspects since the 
courts landmark 1966 decision adequately protect an 
alreadyindicted suspects right to legal help 
the court ruled 22 years ago in a decision called miranda vs 
arizona that police must tell suspects before interrogating them 
that they have a right to remain silent to confer with a lawyer 
before answering any questions and to have a lawyer provided if 
they cannot afford to hire one 
the court said then that such warnings are needed to protect 
suspects privilege against selfincrimination assured by the 
constitutions fifth amendment 
today the court said the socalled miranda warnings also 
adequately protect an indicted defendants sixth amendment right to 
legal assistance 
whatever warnings suffice for mirandas purposes will also be 
sufficient in the context of postindictment questioning justice 
byron r white wrote for the court 
the states decision to take an additional step and commence 
formal adversarial proceedings against the accused does not 
substantially increase the value of counsel to the accused at 
questioning or expand the limited purpose that an attorney serves 
when the accused is questioned by authorities white said 
the issue arose after tyrone patterson was indicted in a 1983 
murder in evanston ill 
patterson a member of the vice lords street gang eventually 
was convicted of the aug 21 1983 beating death of james kevin 
jackson a member of the rival black mobsters street gang 
pattersons convcition and the 24year prison sentence it drew 
were upheld by the illinois supreme court last year 
while in custody at the evanston police station patterson was 
informed he had been indicted by a grand jury for his role in 
jacksons death patterson said he understood his miranda rights 
when read to him by a police officer but agreed to answer questions 
without first seeking a lawyers help 
during two interrogation sessions patterson incriminated 
himself in connection with the crime 
pattersons lawyer later tried to have the incriminating 
comments excluded from the trial contending that using them as 
evidence would violate pattersons sixth amendment right even if 
his fifth amendment right had not been violated 
state courts rejected the argument but the justices last october 
agreed to study pattersons appeal 
today they agreed with the state courts 
because we believe that pattersons waiver of his sixth 
amendment right was knowing and intelligent we find no error 
white said 
justices harry a blackmun john paul stevens william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
the case is patterson vs illinois 867059

religion and at least 25 people were injured police said today 
the clash with homemade bombs and guns lasted about two hours 
thursday in rajshahi about 120 miles northwest of dhaka police 
said by telephone 
trouble began after two major opposition groups began a march to 
protest the new law 
jamaateislami a fundamentalist moslem party tried to block 
the march and fighting broke out police said 
jamaateislami has been involved with the opposition groups 
since last november in an unsuccessful campaign of strikes and 
rallies to oust president hussain muhammad ershad 
but the moslem party broke with its allies over the islam bill 
contending that to oppose it would encourage antiislamic forces 
the bangladesh parliament passed a constitutional amendment on 
june 7 making islam the state religion more than 85 percent of 
bangladeshs 105 million people are moslem 
the law has drawn considerable protest not only from minority 
hindus and christians but also from opposition parties who contend 
it violates the countrys secular tradition

independence after a civil war in 1971

mental health workers and congressmen say theyve been besieged 
by calls from farm families anguished because now gods against 
us as 10 governors prepared recommendations for federal action 
to save droughtstricken farms 
a persistent heat wave meanwhile continued to exacerbate the 
worst drought since the 1930s though parts of the northeast and 
midwest enjoyed cooler weather on thursday than the recordhigh 
temperatures of recent days temperatures hit record lows overnight 
in the northeast and northwest including 40 at burlington vt 
and 39 at olympia wash 
showers and thunderstorms were scattered across much of the 
southeast the gulf coast and central texas the storms brought 
brief relief to some parched areas including a halfinch of rain 
in sections of missouri and a quarterinch at mobile ala parts of 
minnesota wisconsin and iowa also got rain with 18 inches at 
waterloo iowa 
in st louis the medical examiners office said a 99yearold 
woman whose body was found in a sweltering bedroom wednesday died 
from heat in georgia thomas county coroner sam brown said a woman 
died of a heart attack brought on by heat stroke while working in a 
tobacco field 
scattered showers and thunderstorms were predicted today in 
parts of the midwest the southeast and elsewhere but the national 
weather service said the plains and midwest should have continued 
hot and dry weather for the rest of june 
iowa gov terry branstad today again pushed the reagan 
administration for more aid to droughtstricken farmers arguing 
the situation is getting more critical day by day 
its not fair for the farmer who has a crop disaster to bear 
the financial burden of this branstad said on nbcs today 
show we cant afford to see more family farmers be pushed off 
the land 
on thursday branstad and fellow governors from north dakota 
south dakota illinois minnesota nebraska kansas montana ohio 
and wisconsin warned that the drought is seriously affecting food 
production 
the situation is much more critical than we even realized 
said gov george sinner of north dakota chairman of the national 
governors associations agriculture committee 
im afraid were going to lose some farmers and weve lost 
enough already in my state sinner said after a chicago meeting 
of 10 governors us agriculture secretary richard lyng farm 
representatives and agricultural experts 
the governors agreed to 36 recommendations aimed at protecting 
farm income encouraging conservation and efficient use of water 
supplies and preventing early sales of livestock due to feed 
shortages 
gov george mickelson of south dakota said the meeting would 
only be successful if we go to washington and see that these 
things are actually implemented 
lyng promised that the federal government will do what is 
necessary to minimize the severity of the damage he noted that 
1200 counties in 30 states have been granted permission to cut hay 
or graze cattle on governmentrented land set aside for 
conservation or crop reduction 
but he said the extent of the damage is undetermined 
sinner said lyngs speech confused us a bit since experts 
already predict a 25 percent to 30 percent drop in wheat yields 
this year he said livestock feed also has been harmed 
the worsening outlook has set loose an alarming number of 
calls from families troubled by the drought say mental health 
officials 
many of the calls are from adolescents with families who are 
feeling tremendous pressure because the parents are under such 
great stress said myrt armstrong a spokeswoman for the north 
dakota mental health association hotline 
many farm families already suffered from a tough agricultural 
economy said milan christianson a family therapist at north 
dakota state university 
and now some of them are even saying and theyre shaking 
their fist and saying it nature now gods against us 
christianson said 
us rep byron dorgan dnd said hes received many calls 
from desperate farmers dorgan said one woman even blamed him for 
the drought 
during the course of the conversation she was saying you 
know you guys gotta do something you cant let this happen 
dorgan said i said well listen unfortunately we dont 
control the drought

the supreme court today limited the 
governments broad immunity from lawsuits reinstating a suit by a 
couple fired on by a drunk offduty navy medic in maryland 
the 63 ruling expands the governments liability for negligence 
in personal injury claims 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said 
negligence by government employees that allows a foreseeable 
assault to occur by someone else can be a basis for a lawsuit 
against the government 
the government assumed responsibility in this case when navy 
corpsmen found the drunk medic but failed to report his condition 
or that he was armed in violation of navy rules stevens said 
the theory of liability in this case is analogous to cases in 
which a person assumes control of a vicious animal or perhaps an 
explosive device he said 
similarly he said the government has a duty to prevent a 
foreseeably dangerous individual from wandering about unattended 
the case stems from an incident on the evening of feb 6 1982 
outside the bethesda medical center in maryland a few miles from 
the nations capital 
michael and mary sheridan were driving past the hospital when 
shots rang out mrs sheridan was struck by the bullets and pieces 
of the shattered windshield her husband said he suffered from 
shock 
the shots were fired by robert w carr a navy enlisted man who 
worked as a medical aide at the hospital 
according to court records carr was inebriated when he was 
found unconscious shortly before the shooting by three other navy 
corpsmen 
they attempted to take him to an emergency room at one time 
permitting him to slip from their grasp and fall down a flight of 
concrete steps 
before reaching the emergency room carr regained consciousness 
and flashed he barrel of a 22 caliber rifle he was carrying the 
three corpsmen fled and took no further action to alert authorities 
carr began shooting at passing vehicles hitting the sheridans 
car 
the sheridans sued the government claiming the three corpsmen 
were negligent for violating a navy regulation that requires 
personnel to report violations of any navy rule 
the rule in question was carrs possession of firearms on the 
base something that generally is forbidden by the navy 
the sheridans argued that had a civilian possessed a firearm on 
the navy base rather than an offduty corpsman the government 
would be liable for any injury 
the sheridans also said the government violated its duty to 
protect the public by failing to supervise carr properly 
they sued the government under the federal tort claims act which 
authorizes claims against the government for negligence 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year the 
government is shielded from the suit 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to uphold the 
appeals court ruling on grounds that permitting the suit could 
expose the government to a vast array of such claims 
stevens said today the government would not be liable for 
negligence if nothing more was involved than carrs conduct at the 
time he shot at the sheridans 
but stevens said the actions of the other corpsmen opens the way 
for the the government to be sued for negligence 
the government is in a legal position in this case similar to 
that of a private hospital that was allegedly negligent he said 
dissenting were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
the case is sheridan vs us 87626

the completed upgrading of the nations 
air traffic control centers will allow controllers to keep pace 
with air traffic through the next decade the head of the federal 
aviation administration said 
the salt lake city air route traffic control center was the last 
of 20 centers to receive the new 40 million system linking it 
with facilities nationwide 
faa administrator t allan mcartor said during a ceremony 
thursday that the new system operates 10 times faster and has four 
times the capacity of the old system 
the old system was difficult to maintain and had a backup 
system that was switched to quite often the new one will allow for 
much faster response times and easier maintenance and no need for 
a backup system he said 
he said the new system will allow introduction of new functions 
to enhance safety and increase controller productivity 
mcartor said upgrading salt lakes computer was as significant 
as the driving of the golden spike that joined rails linking the 
nations first transcontinental railroad about 50 miles north of 
here at promontory in 1869 
today were passing another transportation milestone with 
another golden spike its appropriate for us to take our bows 
this is a culmination of a lot of work he said 
the salt lake computer cost 9 million with the remainder of 
the 40 million going for support technology 
the salt lake center controls air traffic over utah idaho 
montana and wyoming and parts of oregon nevada and north and south

the fish and wildlife service will not 
consider further applications to exhibit pandas in us zoos while 
it tries to decide what its policy will be the service announced 
today 
at least 30 institutions most in the united states but some 
overseas have been reported negotiating with china for panda 
exhibits posing new cumulative threats to the wild and captive 
populations of the species said a federal register notice 
the service promised decisions as quickly as possible 
the worlds pandas of which only a few hundred live in the wild 
in china are an endangered species protected by treaty and may not 
be imported without a permit from the service 
on monday the service denied import permits to the michigan 
department of natural resources for exhibition of two pandas at the 
state fair on the grounds the trip might harm their breeding 
potential 
last week a court decision barred the collection of fees by the 
toledo ohio zoo for its panda exhibit for which the service had 
granted import permits 
conservation organizations have protested the growing practice 
of showing pandas imported from china pandas attract large crowds 
and sharing the fees reportedly can yield china 300000 to 
500000 
the zoos contend the fees help chinese panda breeding and 
conservation programs but conservationists contend the panda loans 
threaten more harm than good

democrats today released a preliminary draft of a 
platform that promises to restore competence and hope to the 
presidency while avoiding any mention of higher taxes a freeze on 
pentagon spending or a palestinian homeland 
the 3500word draft was being debated revised and voted on 
later today by a 16member platform drafting committee meeting on 
the eve of the first gathering of the full 186member platform 
committee 
the draft incorporates language on a dozen issues that 
representatives of likely nominee michael dukakis and his only 
remaining challenger jesse jackson agreed to two weeks ago in 
drafting sessions on mackinac island mich 
but in every significant area of dispute it is dukakis 
preferences and not jacksons that are embodied in the preliminary 
draft jackson has said he may fight to the convention floor in 
atlanta next month for planks endorsing higher taxes on the rich 
and a freeze on the pentagon budget 
ted sorensen the onetime john f kennedy speechwriter who 
penned an earlier platform discussion paper for democratic 
party chairman paul g kirk jr said in an interview today its 
fairly clear now this will be the shortest platform in over a 
hundred years 
it will be a thematic readable platform it will not have the 
traditional negative cast reagan republican bush those words 
arent even mentioned said sorensen who also helped write this 
draft 
the draft is headed the restoration of competence and hope 
it pledges party leaders and elected officials to restore 
competence caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive 
branch and get it working again fairly for all americans 
it calls for more stable defense budgets appointment of a 
drug czar and maintaining the special relationship with israel 
while pursuing peace in the middle east along the lines laid out in 
the camp david accords 
dukakis who has ruled out any talk in the platform of raising 
taxes gave a terse reply thursday in fall river mass when asked 
if he supported jacksons call for a palestinian homeland 
no of course not said the massachusetts governor and 
certain nominee 
several state democratic parties have called for 
selfdetermination for palestinians saying the issue should be 
part of the platform 
the 16member platform drafting committee headed by rep william 
h gray of philadelphia was planning to vote late today on a 
preliminary draft culled from position papers agreed to in the 
first round of drafting sessions two weeks ago on mackinac island 
mich 
dukakiss representatives there refused to endorse higher taxes 
on the rich and insisted the platform call for a stable pentagon 
budget not the freeze jesse jackson wants 
grays panel is essentially a subcommittee of the full 
186member platform committee which will hold its first meetings 
here saturday and sunday 
the full panel chaired by michigan gov james j blanchard 
will try to craft the document that the entire convention will be 
asked to approve on july 19 jackson has more than a quarter of the 
delegates enough to force a floor fight on any issues he chooses 
jackson huddled in washington on thursday with his convention 
and platform strategists 
ron brown director of jacksons convention operation said 
discssion on the palestinian issue is still going on between the 
jackson and dukakis camps 
asked if jackson would insist on acceptance of a platform plank 
calling for a palestinian homeland brown said we want language 
we can accept 
pressed on the palestinian state question he added we 
havent drawn any line in the sand 
dukakis told reporters i support direct negotiations between 
israel and its neighbors and responsible palestinians who 
recognize israels right to exist within its borders 
jackson reportedly told his lieutenants in the private 
washington meeting that he expects to see all the disputes settled 
and the party unified coming out of atlanta 
jackson asked why he had not endorsed dukakis as have the 
governors other former rivals said kennedy did not stop before 
new york in 1980 hart did not stop before san francisco in 1984 
he said the others may have thrown in the towel in the face of 
adversity but im tough i will never surrender

inadequate trauma care is killing 20000 
americans each year and causing billions of dollars in losses 
researchers say 
most states lack regional systems to treat people injured in 
motor vehicle or industrial accidents falls shootings stabbings 
or drowning a study shows 
it has been 22 years since the national research council labeled 
trauma the neglected disease of modern society the study in 
todays journal of the american medical association said 
only two states maryland and virginia have all the elements 
needed for adequate emergency medical services to handle trauma 
under standards defined by the american college of surgeons the 
study found 
it said 19 states and the district of columbia either had 
incomplete statewide coverage or lacked essential components 
while 29 states had yet to initiate the process of trauma center 
designation 
studies dating to 1979 show onethird of trauma deaths in 
hospitals not able to handle such cases are preventable said the 
study which was led by dr john g west of st joseph hospital in 
orange calif 
up to 20000 americans die needlessly each year because they are 
treated inadequately for trauma west said thursday 
trauma costs the nation an estimated 113 billion annually 
including lost wages twentyfive percent could be saved with 
adequate trauma care he said 
trauma centers differ from regular hospitals they have a 
surgical team ready at all times to operate on critically injured 
patients they also have advanced communications and transportation 
systems to get patients to the site as quickly as possible 
west said many hospitals resist cooperating with trauma care 
networks for various economic reasons 
in urban areas hospitals tend to avoid being designated as a 
trauma center because many trauma patients are poor and cant pay 
he said 
in nonurban areas hospitals want to be designated as trauma 
centers so as not to lose business to rivals 
both problems can be addressed with adequate regional 
cooperation and planning according to the study

in a case of particular importance to rural 
areas the supreme court ruled today that states are not required 
to provide free bus transportion for poor school children 
by a 54 vote the justices said north dakota officials did not 
violate the rights of families that have trouble affording the 
busing charges 
a states decision to allow local school boards the option of 
charging patrons a user fee for bus service is constitutionally 
permissible justice sandra day oconnor said for the court 
the constitution does not require that such service be provided 
at all and it is difficult to imagine why choosing to offer the 
service should entail a constitutional obligation to offer it for 
free 
the ruling is in line with earlier court decisions upholding 
laws that treat the wealthy and poor differently the court has 
said such laws are permissible if they serve a rational purpose 
north dakota law provides free bus transporation to those living 
in districts that have reorganized to broaden their tax base and 
improve education only those districts that have not reorganized 
are allowed to charge parents for busing costs 
the law was intended to spur reorganization while assuring 
people in those districts they would not have to pay for 
transporation 
the court said the law is a rational approach to encouraging 
local school officials to reorganize 
the law was challenged by paula kadrmas from rural dickinson 
nd she said the statute denied equal rights to her daughter 
sarita because the family could not afford a 97 annual bus fee 
ms kadrmas has driven sarita the 16 miles to school rather than 
pay the fee 
bus service in dickinson is offered for a fee to elementary 
school students who live more than three miles from school and to 
high school students who live more than four miles away 
the north dakota supreme court had upheld the law 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said 
today the court continues the retreat from the promise of equal 
educational opportunity by holding that a school districts refusal 
to allow an indigent child who lives 16 miles from the nearest 
school to use a schoolbus service without paying fees does not 
violate the constitution 
he was joined by justice william j brennan justices john paul 
stevens and harry a blackmun dissented in a separate opinion 
in other action the court 
limited severely states authority to lower the electric rates 
public utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal 
regulators 
the court by a 63 vote said mississippi authorities are 
required to pass through to retail electricity customers a 
utilitys federally determined share of the costs of constructing 
the grand gulf 1 nuclear plant 
limited the governments broad immunity from lawsuits 
reinstating a suit by a couple fired on by a drunk offduty navy 
medic in maryland 
the 63 ruling expands the governments liability for negilgence 
in personal injury claims 
ruled that state and federal officials may not be sued for 
monetary damages by people whose social security disability 
benefits were cut off unlawfully 
by a 63 vote the court said the fact that congress has 
provided an assortment of remedies for people whose benefits 
wrongly are terminated means federal courts may not allow such 
lawsuits 
said its famous miranda ruling is sufficient to protect the 
rights of criminal defendants questioned by police after they are 
indicted or otherwise formally charged 
the justices voting 54 to uphold an illinois mans murder 
conviction said the warnings police have given suspects since the 
courts landmark 1966 decision adquately protect an 
alreadyindicted suspects right to legal help 
limited the power of federal judges to dismiss criminal 
charges when prosecutors violate a law requiring speedy trial of 
defendants 
in a 63 ruling the court reinstated the indictment in seattle 
of larry lee taylor who is accused of cocaine trafficking

state and federal officials may not be sued 
for monetary damages by people whose social security disability 
benefits were cut off unlawfully the supreme court ruled today 
by a 63 vote the court said the fact congress has provided an 
assortment of remedies for people whose benefits wrongly are 
terminated means federal courts may not allow such lawsuits 
millions of people file social security disability claims each 
year 
such a remedy not having been included in the elaborate 
remedial scheme devised by congress is unavailable justice 
sandra day oconnor wrote for the court in reversing a legal 
victory previously won by several arizona residents 
their lawsuit sparked by the cuttingoff of benefits in 1981 
had been filed against one state and two federal officials who made 
policy under the social security acts disabilitybenefits program 
the suit said the recipients constitutionally protected 
dueprocess rights had been violated by thensecretary of health 
and human services richard schweiker john svahn head of the 
social security administration at the time and william r sims 
director of the arizona disability determination service 
a series of supreme court decisions since 1971 has allowed 
people alleging certain constitutional violations by public 
officials to sue for monetary damages in federal court 
the court has done so when it found no special factors 
counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by 
congress and no explicit congressional declaration that 
monetary damages may not be awarded in such cases 
in todays decision oconnor said congress has indicated that 
such lawsuits should not be available when social security 
disability benefits are ended unlawfully 
we agree that suffering months of delay in receiving the 
income on which one has depended for the very necessities of life 
cannot be fully remedied by the belated restoration of back 
benefits oconnor said 
she noted that one of the arizonans who sued james chilicky 
was in the hospital recovering from openheart surgery when he was 
informed that his heart condition was no longer classified as 
disabling 
congress however has addressed the problems created by state 
agencies wrongful termination of disability benefits oconnor 
said whether or not we believe that its response was the best 
response congress is the body charged with making the inevitable 
compromises required in the design of a massive and complex welfare 
benefits program 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a 
blackmun dissented 
in appropriate circumstances we should defer to a 
congressional decision to substitute alternate relief for a 
judicially created remedy brennan wrote for the three but he 
said nothing in the social security act or its amendments contains 
any suggestion that congress meant to preclude recognition of 
federal lawsuits for persons whose constitutional rights are 
violated by those charged with administering the program 
the case is schweiker vs chilicky 861781

the supreme court today limited the power of 
federal judges to dismiss criminal charges when prosecutors violate 
a law requiring speedy trial of defendants 
in a 63 ruling the court reinstated the indictment in seattle 
of larry lee taylor who is accused of cocaine trafficking 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said the 
presiding judge in the case abused her authority by failing to 
analyze adequately all the factors that contributed to delay in 
bringing taylor to trial 
seemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay and the 
consequential lack of prejudice to taylor as well as taylors 
own illicit contribution to the delay blackmun said 
he said the judge apparently threw out the case in order to 
send a strong message to the government that unexcused delays will 
not be tolerated that factor alone does not suffice to justify 
barring reprosecution in light of all the other circumstances 
present 
the ruling is a victory for the reagan administration which 
argued for reinstatement of the indictment 
under the speedy trial act of 1974 any criminal defendant in 
federal court must be brought to trial within 70 days of being 
indicted if not the indictment can be dismissed 
in taylors case us district judge barbara j rothstein 
dismissed the indictment and blocked any effort to reindict him on 
the same charges 
taylor had been indicted july 25 1984 on charges of conspiring 
to distribute cocaine and possessing 400 grams of cocaine with 
intent to distribute it 
his trial was scheduled to begin nov 19 1984 one day before 
the 70day deadline under the speedy trial act 
taylor failed to show up for his trial however and was 
declared a fugitive 
he was arrested in san mateo county calif the following 
february taylor then was placed in the custody of federal 
authorities in san francisco while he testified as a defense 
witness in a federal narcotics prosecution 
the federal grand jury that indicted taylor issued a superseding 
indictment on april 24 1985 
judge rothstein in considering the time elapsed from taylors 
disapperance until the issuance of the new indictment ruled that 
most of the delay was not the governments fault and therefore did 
not apply to the speedy trial act 
but she said 15 days of the delay were due to the governments 
actions and therefore the speedy trial act deadline had been missed 
by 14 days 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld her ruling throwing 
out the case 
the supreme court reversed that ruling today 
dissenting were justices john paul stevens william j brennan 
and thurgood marshall 
the case is us vs taylor 87573

a rash of new mudslides sent boulders 
hurtling down a mountainside today disrupting efforts by rescue 
workers to reach 100 people believed buried under tons of mud and 
rocks that smothered this village 
radio reports said 31 people were injured in the mudslides 
thursday in catak village one body was recovered thursday before 
torrential rains triggered more slides that halted rescue efforts 
for the night 
radio reports also said villagers heard people crying for help 
from beneath the debris 
catak is in trabzon province near the black sea about 500 miles 
east of ankara 
turkish civil defense workers helped by a 32member west german 
rescue team with search dogs shoveled through the mud and stones 
that roared down on the mountain village thursday morning 
the dogs found three separate areas where there may be people 
buried but we dont yet know if theyre dead or alive said 
klaus kolter of the mannheimbased west german rescue dog 
association 
soon after the rescuers started work this morning however 
rocks began tumbling down the mountainside hitting a truck and 
slightly injuring the driver the anatolia news agency said 
the rescue operation is difficult because landslides keep 
coming down gov enver hizlan of trabzon province said they 
stop work and raise thick clouds of dust everywhere 
turkish newspapers today reported death tolls ranging between 50 
and 200 they said five buses and two trucks were buried beneath 
tons of mud 
officials denied an announcement thursday by the turkish red 
crescent a relief organization that up to 300 people had been 
killed 
televised reports said the landslides had caused a river to 
flood the village footage showed some houses under water and 
others buried beneath the mud their roofs barely protruding 
the televised reports also showed trees and lampposts lying on 
ground some vehicles were buried in soil 
hizlan said 26 turks and three west german tourists were so far 
reported missing but that he expected the numbers to rise 
they were mostly people from other districts so we havent 
heard from their relatives yet hizlan said 
villagers said the initial mudslides with a deep rumbling noise 
it sounded like someone was exploding dynamite close by there 
were clouds of dust i flung myself down then ran for my life when 
i saw the landslide coming said construction foreman recep 
ergain 
heavy rains apparently triggered the slide which buried a 
crowded coffeehouse a restaurant four houses and a high school 
closed for the summer vacation it blocked a fastflowing stream 
that flooded another part of the village 
the villagers panicked as they rushed away from the falling 
debris i saw 25 to 30 people crammed on a small crossing that 
collapsed under their weight ergain said 
he said bulldozers had uncovered an empty van but that a bus 
was still unaccounted for 
the three missing west germans were identified as markus mutter 
andreas burghard and birgit hastenteufel all traveling to trabzon 
their ages were not immediately available 
they were reported missing by two friends 
catak village president riza yavuz was quoted as telling turkish 
newspapers he had warned the public works ministry of a landslide 
threat in the area where a major highway construction project is 
under way but got no response 
the earth had been loosened by heavy rains in the region where 
frequent landslides are sometimes blamed on extensive cutting of 
forests 
the television reports said it took about four hours for rescue 
teams to reach the site they said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers 
tried unsuccessfully to push away the mud and stone which covered 
the area they moved slowly for fear of causing new landslides 
buses and vehicles were waiting on a road at the time of the 
slide because the highway was closed by the earlier landslide 
thursday shortly after midnight the reports said 
catak is strung along a twolane highway leading to eastern 
anatolia and iran from the black sea port of trabzon it lies in 
turkeys main hazelnutgrowing region near a famous tourist 
attraction the ruined byzantine monastery of surmela

jesse jackson picked up six of 
puerto ricos 57 delegates today and said their switch represented 
a victory for the people who gave him a primary win here 
as jackson opened a threeday visit to this caribbean island 
the boston globe reported that the democratic candidate has 
indicated to aides that he would not accept the vice presidential 
nomination if it is offered by michael dukakis 
what he implied was that he was not going to tie his tail to 
anyone elses kite one aide speaking on condition on anonymity 
told the globe 
jackson breakfasted this morning in the condado beach hotel with 
his local campaign committee and said picking up the delegates 
represented a victory for the peoplea victory for democracy 
he said thursday night he also wants to meet with puerto rican 
delegates in hopes of persuading more of them to support him 
jackson won the islands nonbinding primary on march 20 but 
received none of the islands 57 delegates they were chosen as 
uncommitted then pledged to massachusetts gov michael dukakis by 
puerto rico gov rafael hernandez colon 
weve made steps in the right direction jackson said after 
an hourlong session at the stately 16thcentury spanish governors 
mansion 
hernandez colon said he and other party leaders decided there 
were six delegates who werent firmly committed to dukakis and 
preferred jackson 
we expect we will be able to obtain that support from them 
in the interests of party unity and in the interests of the 
fairness question hernandez colon said 
he said jackson wants other delegates approached as well 
we are willing to undertake such a search to see if additional 
support can be gotten the governor said 
jackson said he will push at next months convention for a 
change in delegateselection rules hernandez colon agreed that 
puerto ricos system should be changed 
hernandez colon explained that the vote for uncommitted delegate 
slates who didnt campaign for presidential candidates was a 
battle of local politics 
his popular democratic party which supports the commonwealth 
status won 55 of 57 delegates over the rival new progressive 
party which wants statehood 
hernandez colon said he had conferred earlier with dukakis 
national campaign officials 
they told me to do what we thought was best for party unity 
hernandez colon said 
jackson reiterated his support for puerto rican 
selfdetermination which he described as giving the islanders the 
right to choose their own status without fear of losing us 
support he said he thought the issue of puerto rican status should 
be addressed at the convention 
asked whether he sought support from the puerto rican governor 
for himself as the partys vice presidential candidate jackson 
replied we did not discuss that but between now and saturday 
he could get that inspired 
jackson said earlier in washington he has made a decision on how 
he would reply if offered the vice presidential nomination but is 
keeping it private for now hernandez colon said jackson deserves 
serious consideration 
hernandez colon angered many puerto rican politicians in new 
york by campaigning for dukakis jackson was accompanied here by 
state sen olga mendez of new york 
the governor who will head puerto ricos delegation to atlanta 
met in new york two weeks ago with puerto rican political leaders 
to explain why he supported dukakis 
the governor who for years has had close ties with 
massachusetts sen edward m kennedy said he supported dukakis 
because he considered him a socially progressive governor who had 
the best chance to win dukakis also is willing to support 
increased autonomy for the commonwealth hernandez colon said 
the 32 million puerto ricans have us citizenship and are 
largely selfgoverning but subject to federal laws they do not 
vote in national elections and their delegate to congress has no 
vote

the white house said today it wants legal 
proceedings to go forward in the case of fired national security 
council aide oliver l north and is doing everything possible to 
release the necessary classified documents 
spokesman roman popadiuk responded to a statement by judge 
gerhard a gesell who said at a hearing in us district court 
thursday the highest levels of the government have to make a 
decision as to whether this case is going to go or if its not 
going to go 
gesell suggested that attorney general edwin meese iii name a 
justice department official to help the administration decide 
whether it is willing to make the disclosures of national security 
documents that are necessary to move the case to trial 
popadiuk said a team of senior officials has been spending an 
inordinate amount of hours to meet the demand for relase of 
classified documents 
we want the legal proceedings to go forward but the question 
of a trial is up to the judge and the prosecutor popadiuk said 
we are doing everything we possibly can 
popadiuk added that he could not say whether the administration 
would consider any further steps to speed up the declassification 
process 
the judge said that he wondered whether we dont need a clear 
decision from the administration itself that they want to try this 
case or they dont want to 
gesell made the comments after he heard independent counsel 
lawrence e walshs request for a months delay in the production 
of 150000 pages of classified cia and justice department documents 
still to be reviewed by an interagency task force 
the group composed of officials from the agencies that produced 
the documents must identify the passages the government doesnt 
want disclosed in court walsh said it cannot complete the work by 
july 1 
while the members of the interagency task force are not trying 
to torpedo the case or help the case they are not in the 
position to judge the larger implications of the case the judge 
said 
but the obstacles keep arising 
voicing frustration at the additional delay the judge indicated 
that he had planned on friday to issue an order setting the date 
for norths trial im not going to do that the case isnt 
ready he said 
if you cant get a trial going soon there isnt going to be a 
trial gesell told lawyers on both sides 
the hearing was held a day after gesell had given north until 
july 11 to specify which secret documents he wants to disclose in 
court when the case goes to trial 
the fired national security council aide is accused of 
conspiring with former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord to 
illegally divert usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
rebels gesell ordered separate trials for each of the four 
so far 82000 pages of classified documents have been turned 
over to the defense for pretrial inspection 
walsh said that a much smaller number but still a large 
number of documents were relevant to the case he said he doubted 
that many of the 150000 pages of unreviewed material would be 
admissible as evidence 
under the classified information procedures act a defendant 
must notify the court before trial of his intention to disclose 
specific secrets in court 
the court has the power to delete portions of documents the 
government doesnt want disclosed or to substitute statements of 
facts that the material would prove if shown to the jury 
but if there is a sufficient quantity of secret material that 
cannot be edited the judge is empowered to dismiss the charges if 
the government refuses to let it be disclosed in court 
an alternative to dismissing all the charges in the irancontra 
case would be to try the defendants on those counts of the 
indictment that dont involve the wide use of classified documents 
clearly the main conspiracy count against all four defendants 
would require the greatest disclosure of government secrets to show 
they acted with authority of high government officials 
north and poindexter might not be entitled to disclose as many 
secrets to rebut charges that they lied to congress or obstructed a 
presidential inquiry into the irancontra affair 
the same would hold for charges that north obstructed an fbi 
inquiry into who paid for a 15000 security fence around his home 
in great falls va or that he pocketed some of the travelers 
checks given to him by a contra leader to cover expenses

the head of the congress of racial equality 
confirmed today that an investigator hired by his group has 
uncovered evidence of drug use in the case of a black teenager who 
claims she was kidnapped and raped by white men 
meanwhile a man who says he is a surveillance expert either has 
or soon will appear before a federal grand jury investigating 
possible fraud in the tawana brawley case according to reports 
published today 
the new york times citing unidentified sources said 
authorities had granted samuel mcclease immunity from prosecution 
for illegal breakins and other possible offenses in exchange for 
his cooperation 
the new york post also quoting unnamed sources said that the 
deal may include mccleases pleading guilty to some minor charges 
mcclease has said he was hired by the rev al sharpton a 
brawley family adviser to plant listening devices in the home and 
office of one of the brawley family lawyers c vernon mason and 
in sharptons own home 
the private investigator hired by core said in a wkny radio 
interview thursday in kingston that he had evidence suggesting miss 
brawley was involved in drugs and prostitution during her fourday 
disappearance last november 
our best belief is that tawana got involved in something 
initially voluntarily said galen kelley a forensic psychologist 
hired by core executive director roy innis last december it had 
to do with drugs youd have to define it as prostitution 
kelly said he would report his findings to the grand jury in new 
york city thats the report he has presented to me innis said 
of kelleys comments today from his brooklyn office that drug 
thing comes up all the time 
mcclease has said his tapes show that the advisers did not 
believe miss brawleys story that she was kidnapped and raped by 
six white men but were using the case for personal and political 
gain 
none of the papers sources could verify that the tapes included 
the information mcclease said they did however wcbstv reported 
today that both us attorney rudolph giuliani who heads the 
federal investigation and state attorney general robert abrams 
who has been appointed special prosecutor in the brawley case have 
heard the tapes 
miss brawley 16 and her family have refused to cooperate with 
a state grand jury which has been trying to learn what happened to 
the wappingers falls girl during four days last november 
the post said that mcclease turned over tapes of conversations 
to the federal grand jury thursday the sources also said mcclease 
testified thursday and was expected to resume testifying today 
but the times said it was unclear when mcclease would be called 
to testify 
mcclease said sharpton feared as early as february that the 
story was falling apart and wanted something he could use to 
protect himself 
sharpton denies knowing meeting or hiring mcclease the team of 
brawley advisers have called him a liar

the navy will drop manslaughter charges 
against at least two of the six sailors charged in a recruits 
death and has offered nonjudicial punishment rather than a court 
martial to three of them defense attorneys say 
attorneys for petty officers 1st class richard e blevins and 
david j smith instructors at the naval rescue swimmer school 
said they were informed thursday of the decision by rear adm david 
r morris chief of naval air training in corpus christi texas 
a spokesman for morris lt lee saunders said today he couldnt 
comment on the lawyers statements because the admiral is still 
investigating the case 
blevins smith and three other instructors were charged with 
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery in the 
march 2 death of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
mirecki was literally scared to death when he was forced into a 
swimming pool after trying to quit a rescue course at the pensacola 
naval air station according to testimony at an investigative 
hearing two weeks ago 
morris also gave blevins and smith the option of nonjudicial 
punishment which could mean a pay cut restriction to the base or 
extra duty on the conspiracy charge and an added charge of battery 
the lawyers said 
thomas a torchia the officer in charge of the school was 
charged only with dereliction of duty and also is being offered 
nonjudicial punishment instead of a courtmartial said his 
lawyer lt thomas c leighton 
none of the three have decided whether to accept the unspecified 
nonjudicial punishment or opt for courtmartial which could clear 
them of the charges their attorneys said 
smiths civilian attorney barry beroset said he was told of 
the admirals decision in a telephone call from the prosecutor in 
the case lt cmdr larry wynne 
blevins attorney lt steven h cohen said today that blevins 
was given until monday to make his decision if he should opt for 
the nonjudicial punishment he would go before morris on wednesday 
in pensacola 
petty officers 2nd class frankie d deaton john w zelenock and 
michael w combe had faced the same charges as smith and blevins 
but lawyers for those three refused to comment on the disposition 
of their cases 
if courtmartialed and found guilty the defendants could have 
been sentenced to prison and expelled from the service 
nonjudicial punishment could include a 50 percent cut in pay 
for two months reduction of one pay grade restriction to base for 
60 days extra duty for 45 days or any combination of those 
penalties cohen told wear 
lynne johansen mireckis sister said the family expected that 
courtmartials might not be recommended for all the defendants 
following the investigative hearing 
mrs johansen said criminal proceedings were secondary to 
finding out how her brother died which the hearing accomplished 
and said changes in the training program were made to avoid a 
recurrence 
we still feel very satisfied in knowing many changes have been 
made in the situation she said in a telephone interview from 
appleton 
the rescue swimmer school was closed march 29 and reopened 
monday after changes in procedures including a ban against 
instructors touching recruits

the drought may be holding the attention of 
crop watchers around the world but professionals in the 
agriculture department also are keeping a weather eye on other 
countries that compete with american grain farmers in the global 
market 
a deep fear of farmers real or partly imagined is that the 
us government other countries war in the mideast or the weather 
might deprive them of the valuable export markets that have meant 
so much 
with rising grain prices and declining prospects for 1988 
harvests some foreign buyers might be tempted to shop around to 
see if better deals can be made its one of the possibilities the 
usda is considering 
foreign grain production excluding rice is forecast up 3 
percent in 198889 led by increases in europe and the soviet 
union says the departments economic research service 
however among the major exporters competing with the united 
states smaller gains in grain area and production are expected 
if europe and the soviet union are discounted total area and 
production of wheat and coarse grains mostly corn oats barley 
and sorghum are expected to climb by less than 2 percent 
remaining well below the levels of the early 1980s 
as with us harvest prospects this year the world situation 
also is uncertain and early crop projections are likely to undergo 
substantial revisions especially for crops in the southern 
hemisphere 
two agency economists pete riley and sara schwartz examined 
the competitive grain export situation in a report scheduled for 
the july issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
concerns about hot and dry weather in the united states and 
canada and the recent run up in prices may have influenced 
southern hemisphere farmers planting decisions which are made in 
may and june the report said 
but the report added that only a few large adjustments in 
planted area or production are expected some larger some smaller 
and the changes tend to offset each other 
the global wheat supply has tightened more than for coarse 
grains the report said wheat trade has been brisk but world 
traffic in coarse grains has been flat since 198586 and compared 
with wheat supplies of corn and the other grains are abundant 
wheat plantings in the major competiting countries are forecast 
to rise by less than 1 percent in 198889 higher prices may 
trigger some expansion in australia and argentina but wet weather 
last fall in the european economic community held down plantings 
total eec wheat plantings for 1988 may have dropped 2 percent 
but yields are expected to be greater this year so production 
could be up 
in the coarse grains major competitors are projected to boost 
production by only 2 percent this year with corn output rising the 
most significantly not counting the eec where no change is 
indicated corn production could rise by 14 percent over 198788 
smaller increases are expected for barley and sorghum 
the most dramatic change among the coarse grain competitors is 
likely in thailand where a monsoon hurt the 198788 corn crop and 
the area planted was already down because of low prices the 
report said 
in 198889 thailands corn production is forecast to jump more 
than 75 percent to 48 million metric tons and will enable 
thailand to recapture some of its traditional export markets 
south africa another competitor is also boosting corn 
production despite the governments policy of diversifying its 
agricultural exports away from corn production could increase to 8 
million tons from 75 million last year 
in argentina coarse grain output was forecast at about the same 
as in 198788 although the planted area may increase about 4 
percent 
an average argentine growing season could mean more 
abandonment of planted acreage in 198889 offsetting some of the 
likely increase in plantings while yields are not expected to 
match 198788 the report said last season with excellent 
conditions and high yields there was belowaverage abandonment 
eastern europe although not usually considered a major 
exporter is expected to rebound sharply in corn production this 
year thus allowing for larger exports and reduced imports 
chinas corn production may be down slightly to around 76 
million tons in 198889 with the planted area declining 3 percent 
the report said

the fish and wildlife service said friday it 
plans to cancel or restrict special september hunting seasons in 18 
states for the bluewinged teal a variety of duck hard hit by the 
current drought 
director frank dunkle has accepted a staff recommendation made 
earlier in the week to propose dropping the early season generally 
nine days this year in alabama arkansas indiana illinois

a similar season for all ducks in iowa would be canceled 
additional shortening of the season or lower bag limits would be 
proposed for bluewinged teal and in some cases other ducks in 
florida kentucky tennessee alaska puerto rico and the virgin 
islands 
the bluewinged teal has been one of the species most damaged by 
the drought and loss of marshy breeding habitat in the northern 
great plains and in canada the service earlier called the breeding 
outlook this year grim 
the normal population of 48 million has declined to about 36 
million according to preliminary estimates 
dunkles decision will be published for public comment and final 
regulations should be adopted july 18 spokeswoman meagan durham 
said 
regulations for the regular hunting season later in the fall 
usually are adopted in august and the service has warned hunters 
it is taking a hard look at the restrictions it adopted in 1985 
to see if they should be tightened further

ah wilderness eugene oneills only 
comedy is tinged with a poignancy that rarely surfaces in revivals 
of this sweettempered play 
that sadness comes through in the production starring jason 
robards and colleen dewhurst which opened thursday at broadways 
neil simon theater it is a wistful gentle remounting of a work 
that celebrates the loss of innocence as well as the gaining of 
selfknowledge 
what makes the poignancy even more apparent is the pairing of 
the play with long days journey into night they are running 
in repertory at the neil simon as part of the first new york 
international festival of the arts long days journey with 
its miserly father drugaddled mother and alcoholic sons was the 
reality of oneills life ah wilderness is the fantasy 
oneill once called the comedy a nostalgia for a youth i never 
had and a rosyhued remembrance infuses the entire play its 
set in 1906 six years before long days journey into night 
and takes place in a small connecticut town during that most 
american of holidays the fourth of july parades picnics 
fireworks family dinners with most of the clan gathered around the 
table all are part of the plays long leisurely story 
ah wilderness centers on the miller family particularly 
the 17yearold son richard a standin for the playwright richard 
is a rebel and a romantic fond of quoting swinburne shaw and all 
those other radical writers dismissed by his mother and 
secretly admired by his father 
the parents in ah wilderness are everything oneill wanted 
in his own father and mother nate and essie miller are 
goodhumored people who may be stern but are also always forgiving 
most of the other adults are equally understanding theres quiet 
aunt lily and the harddrinking but genial uncle sid who is not 
made unbearable or destroyed by liquor like some of the characters 
in long days journey 
robards excels as crusty but kindhearted father and dewhurst 
manages to turn the role of the mother usually considered a minor 
character into a protective hen who will battle for her baby even 
if she disapproves of what he does they are adept at getting 
laughs out of the most inconsequential situation 
the pivotal role of richard is played by a ruddycheeked young 
actor named raphael sbarge he brings an openmouthed innocence to 
a character who could be insufferable but here is genuine and 
appealing 
there are effective cameos from elizabeth wilson as lily george 
hearn as a goldenvoiced uncle sid a happy drunk who knows how to 
sing campbell scott as richards pompous older brother and annie 
golden as a babyfaced lady of the evening who tries to seduce 
richard 
the setting by michael h yeargan also links the play to long 
days journey into night that living room designed by ben 
edwards was dark and dank and featured a view of long island 
sound the same water view is in yeargans set but the living room 
is filled with bright furnishings and framed by flowered wallpaper 
arvin brown has directed the show at a slow pace there are 
three long acts and he has filled each with a lot of stage 
business it is a deliberately oldfashioned approach to the play 
allowing the audience to savor each member of the large cast 
ah wilderness ends on a hopeful expectant note as brown 
and company conjure up a stunning tableau richard gazes dreamily 
at a full summer moon while his father remarks to his mother 
spring isnt everything theres a lot to be said for autumn 
and winter if youre together 
its a togetherness oneills family never achieved but at 
least he managed to unite his imaginery family in ah 
wilderness robards dewhurst and the rest of the cast bring them 
vibrantly to life 
frank rich in the new york times said its hard to 
imagine contemporary theatergoers being held by ah wilderness 
unless they see long days journey in close proximity i would 
visit the plays in reverse order of composition for oneills most 
cheerful work is best enjoyed now not for its comedy but as a 
chaser to the mature brew of his art 
howard kissel in the new york daily news wrote arvin browns 
production captures beautifully the sunlit quality of the play at 
times it moves slowly but after all this is a period when 
motoring is still regarded as a sport 
clive barnes in the new york post wrote that the play provided 
total enchantment on the surface ah wilderness is no 
better a play than life with father or you cant take it with 
you but listen deeper and the echoing resonance of oneill the 
youth of commonplace language with the certainty of natural speech 
the depth of characterization and aptness of anecdote soars above 
the conventional

lush green mountainsides in southern 
vermont have been scarred with patches of brown the work of tiny 
insects that are threatening the states maple sugar industry and 
tourism 
a bug known as the pear thrip is blamed for damaging nearly 
500000 acres of forest in vermont this year by comparison 21000 
acres were damaged last year said h brenton teillon chief of 
forest protection for the state department of forests and parks 
officials say the bugs that attacked millions of maple trees 
this spring are the states worst insect problem in more than 25 
years the current drought is putting still further stress on trees 
the maples are a source of income for hundreds of vermonters who 
tap them to produce syrup and sugar candy the state produced 
370000 gallons of maple syrup this year leading the nation and 
that generated 125 million in income 
the loss of a significant portion some foresters fear up to a 
fifth of the maples could also mean far fewer dollars this fall 
from tourists who come to view the foliage 
from a window in a fourseat plane state forester pete 
norkeveck assessed the damage over bennington on thursday 
afternoon some forestland had retained its brilliant green but 
there were wide swaths of shriveled brown foliage with tints of 
gray and orange 
those trees are in real trouble says norkeveck if we 
dont get some rain in the next couple of weeks were looking at a 
very high mortality rate even with some rain a lot of them might 
not survive 
pear thrips have been in the united states since the early part 
of the century but historically they have been a problem mainly in 
orchards 
norkeveck said the pear thrips attack a trees flowers in early 
spring the bugs then enter a period of dormance 
experts are unsure why the problem flared up this year they 
cite a variety of possible factors including the drought a 
heavierthannormal blooming of the maples this spring and a cold 
snap at a key time this spring that may have been a boon to the 
insects 
bob twitchell of landgrove said he was one of the first maple 
growers to be affected he first saw the defoliation in the early 
summer of 1985 to reduce stress on the maples on his 60acres he 
decided not to tap his trees the following spring losing his main 
source of income for a year 
if you dont tap for one year you dont have the resources to 
continue he said a lot of people just do it as a parttime 
thing and they dont depend on it as much but if i let up for one 
year im done for 
the problem has grown only worse 
it looks like winter theres nothing there he said i 
just dont know as theres anything i can do 
hes given up sugaring completely for lumbering and talks of 
selling off some of his property to make ends meet 
a similar sense of worry and uncertainty was evident thursday 
among 50 maple sugar producers landowners state and canadian 
officials who met in bennington to discuss the problem 
to a lesser degree the infestation has also affected parts of 
other new england states new york and pennsylvania foresters said

the american civil liberties union has filed a 
lawsuit on behalf of an artist whose portrait of the late mayor 
harold washington in womens undergarments was seized by police 
from an exhibition 
the lawsuit filed thursday in federal court seeks 100000 in 
damages from police superintendent leroy martin unidentified 
officers and three city council members allan streeter dorothy 
tillman and bobby rush 
several black aldermen marched from city hall to the school of 
the art institute on may 11 to demand that the portrait by david 
nelson be removed from an exhibiton of students work 
police seized the painting saying the display could provoke a 
riot 
we all must follow the rule of law not the rule of 
aldermen said aclu attorney harvey grossman the law is quite 
clear the police must control the audience not the speaker 
not the painting 
i am deeply offended and angry at the vigilante behavior of 
the aldermen and the irresponsible conduct of police nelson said 
in a statement i am suing to vindicate my rights and to ensure 
that chicago aldermen and police do not become the censors of other 
artists in the future 
rush called the lawsuit frivolous 
im not sure what the absolute motivation is whether its an 
attempt to enhance aclu fundraising activities or if its 
political because there were only three aldermen targeted for the 
suit he added 
defendants are accused of depriving nelson of his right to 
freedom of expression under the first amendment his right to be 
free from unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment and his 
right not to be deprived of property without due process under the 
14th amendment

the fish and wildlife service warned zoos 
friday it will not consider applications to import pandas for 
exhibit while it tries to decide whether and how to restrict the 
practice 
a federal register notice said reported plans by 30 instititions 
in the united states and abroad to show pandas on loan from china 
are posing new cumulative threats to the wild and captive 
populations of the species 
michigans department of natural resources was denied import 
permits on monday to show pandas at a state fair last week a 
court order barred the toledo ohio zoo from collecting fees to see 
pandas there on loan from china 
the toledo pandas were imported under a permit granted by the 
service 
pandas are an endangered species protected by treaty and may not 
be imported without a permit from the service only a few hundred 
live in the wild in china and zoologists fear the populations 
devastated by the loss of bamboo forests are not large enough to 
be selfsustaining 
conservation organizations claim the enthusiasm for showing 
pandas imported from china which attract large feepaying crowds 
could hurt the species chinas share of the fees from a panda loan 
has been reported at 300000 to 500000 
the zoos contend that the fees help chinese panda breeding and 
conservation programs 
the service promised decisions as quickly as possible

pope john paul ii visited a former 
nazi death camp and condemned the ideology that made it possible 
but the pontiff angered austrias chief rabbi by not making any 
specific reference to the jews 
an estimated 110000 people died in mauthausen the most 
infamous austrian concentration camp during the third reich 
here in mauthausen were people who in the name of a lunatic 
ideology set into motion a whole machinery of contempt and hatred 
of others john paul said during a speech at the site 
he also emphasized the pain and death of all people 
especially those who when world war ii was raging in europe 
suffered the torture of such camps 
however while the pontiff mentioned marcel callo a catholic 
activist who died in mauthausen and other catholics persecuted in 
nazi camps he made no reference to jews by name 
that infuriated chaim eisenberg austrias chief rabbi who told 
reporters in vienna a visit to mauthausen without mentioning the 
word jews once is not satisfactory 
the only jew he mentions who suffered is jesus christ and he 
didnt die in mauthausen eisenberg added an estimated 6 million 
jews died in the holocaust 
the 68yearold pontiff told austrias jewish leaders earlier 
today that palestinians have a right to a homeland but did not 
respond to their call for the vatican to give full diplomatic 
recognition to the state of israel 
the jewish people has the right to a homeland as any other 
nation has according to international law john paul said the 
same goes for the palestinian people many of whom have become 
homeless and refugees 
john paul reminded austrian jewish community president paul 
grosz and five of the countrys other leading jews that he had made 
a similar call last september in miami during his tour of the 
united states 
by means of a common readiness for understanding and 
compromise solutions should finally be found which lead to a just 
comprehensive and lasting peace in this area the pope said 
delivering his remarks in german 
they met at the office of the papal ambassador called the 
nuncio to austria 
john paul then flew by helicopter to the town of trausdorf near 
the border with hungary where he celebrated an outdoor mass for an 
estimated 80000 roman catholics most of them from hungary and 
yugoslavia 
speaking to the jewish leaders the pope said the 
incomprehensible pain suffering and tears of the holocaust 
still are before my eyes and etched deep in my soul 
but he added it would be clearly unjust and untrue to charge 
christianity with these unspeakable crimes 
the roman catholic leader said that instead the holocaust arose 
from a world without and even aimed against god and called for 
an end to antisemitism 
some jewish leaders have accused christians and the vatican in 
particular of failing to do enough to prevent the holocaust 
grosz in his remarks said the pontiffs decision to receive 
controversial president kurt waldheim at the vatican last year 
shows that many austrians still have not come to terms with their 
past 
waldheim has faced allegations of complicity in nazi war crimes 
during his service in the german army while some jewish leaders 
have accused the church of failing to try to prevent the holocaust 
waldheim has denied any wrongdoing during his world war ii 
military service 
the jewish community leader added we sincerely regret that 
full diplomatic relations between israel and the holy see have not 
yet been established the pontiff did not respond to that point 
the vatican has cited what it says is israels lack of settled 
borders as well as the international dispute over jerusalem for 
the absence of diplomatic ties with israel 
grosz appealed to the pontiff to work together with the jewish 
community to seek a way to solve the problem of the middle east 
together 
grosz the head of the nations 12000member jewish community 
later told a news conference that the good atmosphere of the 
meeting was overwhelming

the state department says it will begin 
consultations with congress this autumn on what to do about the 
us embassy in moscow which may have to be torn down because it 
is believed to be riddled with listening devices 
state department spokesman charles e redman said consultations 
with congress will be necessary before a presidential decision on 
the embassy because appropriations to fix the problem will be 
necessary 
a final report on the matter is still pending from a team of 
consultants the bdm corp and mkferguson co 
according to a preliminary report by the private engineers it 
would be better and no more expensive to tear down the entire 
eightstory chancery building and erect a new structure than 
rebuild part of the building 
congressional investigations led by reps olympia snowe 
rmaine and dan mica dfla also have led to suggestions the 
facility be razed 
on the other hand surveys commissioned by the reagan 
administration recommend the remodeling approach former defense 
secretary james r schlesinger proposed that the top three stories 
be rebuilt and that the most sensitive work be conducted in a newly 
constructed annex 
a study by anne l armstrong head of the presidents foreign 
intelligence advisory board also said the building could be 
salvaged 
the united states began work on the new building a decade ago 
but it has not been occupied by american diplomats because of 
structural flaws and evidence that the soviet embedded listening 
devices in the walls 
in a titfortat move the soviets have been denied access to 
their new chancery building in washington

the supreme court today relaxed the deadlines 
prison inmates face when seeking to appeal their cases in federal 
appellate courts 
by a 54 vote the justices said inmates satisfy one 
preliminary 30day deadline if they deliver the necessary 
documents to prison authorities in time 
those documents do not have to reach a court within the 30day 
deadline justice william j brennan wrote for the court 
prentiss houston serving a 50year sentence in a tennessee 
prison for murder challenged his state court conviction in an 
appeal to a federal trial judge in early 1986 
when the judge threw out houstons appeal the inmate decided to 
appeal to the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
he prepared the necessary notice of appeal to send to the 
trial judge and gave it to prison authorities 27 days after the 
judges ruling against him 
federal law allows 30 days for such notices to be filed with 
the clerk of the federal district court houstons notice was 
stamped filed by the court clerks office one day beyond the 
30day deadline and his appeal was dismissed by the 6th circuit 
court for that reason 
reviving houstons appeal before the 6th circuit court the 
nations highest court today said houstons notice of appeal was 
filed the moment he delivered it to prison officials 
unskilled in law unaided by counsel and unable to leave the 
prison an inmates control over the processing of his notice 
necessarily ceases as soon as he hands it over to the only public 
officials to whom he has access the prison authorities brennan 
said 
he added that such a rule for judging whether a deadline has 
been met will help cut down the number of disputes over such 
filings 
brennan was joined by justices byron r white thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
chie justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy dissented 
writing for the four scalia acknowledged that the rule 
fashioned today makes a good deal of sense but he said the 
court was taking a shortcut to changing federal law and cheating 
congress out of an opportunity to veto the change before it takes 
place 
houston and a codefendant bobby vinson pleaded guilty to the 
aug 10 1982 killing in south fulton tenn of marcel anderson 
22 of union city 
police said that the two accosted anderson in an apartment 
complex parking lot and that vinson shot him as he tried to get 
out of a car 
the case is houston vs lack 875428

the equal employment opportunity commission 
has sent out thousands of notices to people whose age 
discrimination complaints may have been handled improperly eeoc 
chairman clarence thomas said friday 
thomas said the 7500plus notices went out in cases where there 
was reason to believe complaints had not been pursued within the 
twoyear time frame required by law whether due to agency 
negligence or late filing 
the notices were required under the age discrimination claims 
assistance act which president reagan signed into law april 7 the 
act was designed to give second chances to complainants following 
revelations that eeoc workers had let hundreds of cases expire 
beyond the statute of limitations 
we blanketed the world with them thomas said of the notices 
during a break in a hearing by the senate special committee on 
aging we did not want to underestimate we know we overestimated 
well make absolutely sure that there are none left hanging out 
there 
thomas said the notices sent out last month tell people that 
you may still have an opportunity to pursue your case 
age discrimination complaints constitute 20 percent of the eeoc 
caseload the new claims assistance law applies to cases filed 
after jan 1 1984 and shuts the door on second chances in 
september 1989 
currently the agency is aware of 1650 age discrimination cases 
that may have been improperly handled thomas said he expected only 
3 percent of the new notices to prompt reopened proceedings 
some of the notices are probably duplicates he said and many 
people wont respond he said other cases may have been settled or 
closed properly or may turn out to be without merit 
thomas said that in the future age discrimination cases will be 
pursued first before race and sex discrimination complaints he 
said the age bias law is the only one that contains a statute of 
limitations

employees of general dynamics corp 
have for the past three years secretly helped the taiwan government 
develop a new fighter plane it was reported today 
the fort worth startelegram said the aircraft is being designed 
by a group of about 100 taiwanese engineers and technicians with 
general dynamics employees acting as advisers 
the americans are not directly involved in the aircraft design 
or production said a company official familiar with the program 
who spoke on the condition he not be identified we are not 
building it or designing it we are merely teaching them how to 
design it he said 
the program has the approval of the state department but has 
operated quietly to avoid offending china china and taiwan do not 
recognize each other 
its a touchy political problem the state department knows 
about it china knows about it but as long as it doesnt get a lot 
of publicity they wont complain the official told the 
startelegram 
the nature of the ustaiwanese military relationship is a 
highly sensitive issue that state department officials are 
reluctant to discuss 
under a 1982 agreement the united states retains the right to 
sell defense equipment and services taiwan needs for defense at 
the same time however a 1972 agreement between china and the 
united states imposes qualitative and quantitative restrictions 
on what taiwan is given 
neither agreement spells out in detail how the restrictions 
apply to particular weapons systems 
alex almasov a state department spokesman today declined to 
comment on the report about general dynamics 
general dynamics spokesman z joe thornton told the newspaper 
thursday that he could not comment on the program 
we cant talk about that its a sensitive issue he 
said 
the unidentified general dynamics official said that several 
hundred employees have worked on the program which is worth about 
200 million to the defense contractor and also involves other us 
companies 
work on the program is being done in a small unmarked building 
in fort worth the startelegram said 
col yi chou a weapons procurement officer in taiwans 
representative office in washington dc said the taiwanese 
government has a team based at general dynamics 
he declined to provide any details of the work being performed 
in fort worth but said the team was headed by a taiwanese military 
officer 
a press officer at the chinese embassy said that he could not 
comment on the taiwanese aircraft program however chiwei zhang 
added our governments general policy is that we oppose any 
foreign country to supply arms to taiwan

successful fighter aircraft in us history with more than 3000

ousted haitian president leslie manigats stopover 
in miami today on his way to an international forum of christian 
democrats in rome wont win him support from haitians living in the 
united states a haitianamerican leader said 
he thinks hell look better in the eyes of the haitians back 
home but hes not going to get a tribute here said roger 
biamby head of the haitian american community association of dade 
biamby said manigat hopes his visit to miami will shore up his 
credentials as a genuine opposition figure but the strategy wont 
work 
we were not supporters of manigat said the rev gerard 
jeanjuste who heads the haitian refugee center a grassroots 
organization in little haiti 
manigat arrived in miami this afternoon aboard a private 10seat 
jet as he walked with his wife to a us customs office he 
flashed a v sign to about 25 haitians gathered at miami 
international airport they responded with applause 
he had been in exile in the dominican republic since he was 
overthrown sunday by lt gen henri namphy 
namphy ran the country as head of an interim junta for two years 
after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile he turned over 
power in february to manigat who was elected the previous month in 
militaryrun elections that were rife with fraud 
i do understand that he is passing through miami friday on his 
way to rome where there is a meeting of the christian democrat 
international conference said state department spokesman charles 
redman hes going to be participating in that 
the united states is not involved in manigats travel plans and 
no administration officials planned to meet with him redman said 
manigat 57 will probably escape any protest demonstrations 
because exiles in miami dont want to be seen as backing sundays 
coup instead haitian groups here plan to ignore manigat 
he should not be allowed to come to the united states hes a 
traitor to the haitian people hes a traitor to democracy 
biamby said referring to allegations that manigat was connected to 
the violence that disrupted haitian elections

liberal democrats using the conservative 
heritage foundation as their model are drawing up a progressive 
blueprint they hope a president dukakis would use to set the 
direction for his administration and to avoid victory without 
vision 
encouraged by opinion polls showing dukakis has stronger support 
around the country than republican george bush project leader mark 
green said friday it was put together because we think 
conservatism is faltering because we think there is a new 
progressive majority 
green an unsuccessful candidate for the senate in new york in 
1986 is president of the democracy project sponsor of the attempt 
to formulate a progressive agenda 
transition 89 is dedicated to avoiding victory without 
vision he said looking back at the election of democrat jimmy 
carter 12 years ago green said in 1976 it was a political 
victory without a program carter lasted one term and then was 
trounced in 1980 by ronald reagan 
as reagan prepared to take power from the democratic president 
an obscure conservative think tank called the heritage foundation 
suddenly attained prominence as a source of ideas for the incoming 
administration 
heritage was ready with agenda for progress a 378page 
study that recommended cutting 586 billion from the 1982 federal 
budget while at the same time increasing defense spending by 337 
billion 
heritage became a source of ideas and personnel for the reagan 
administration and its days in obscurity ended 
green and his fellow liberals are hoping for a similar 
resurgence in the event of a dukakis victory in november 
we hope to be a conduit between 20 years of progressive 
public interest policy experience and a new government open to 
fresh approaches said green in a statement announcing release 
of a 140page book called ideas that work 60 solutions for 
americas 3rd century 
the book includes proposals in areas ranging from the economy 
education and the environment to foreign and defense policy 
but while the book offers a preview of the approaches the 
progressives would take green said the main project of his group 
is an agencybyagency study of the government by 48 experts who 
would issue their recommendations after the november election 
while a lot of folks are understandably concentrating on the 
politics of 88 transition 89 wants to concentrate on the 
policies of 89 he said 
one of the people on greens list was stephen f cohen an 
expert of ussoviet relations at princeton university who said 
suddenly it seems theres a chance to end the cold war 
cohen said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at great risk to 
himself is revising in the confines of his own national security 
elite almost 70 years of soviet cold war dogma the key soviet 
cold war dogma has been that the nature of the united states made 
the cold war inevitable it had nothing to do with soviet behavior 
and gorbachev is now saying that isnt so 
cohen said the next president ought to send a message to 
gorbachev publicly or privately that this president is prepared 
to negotiate every dispute issue anew 
he expressed dismay at dukakis commitment to a buildup in 
conventional forces and said he has seen no sign from the 
democratic candidate that he or his advisers are willing to seize 
the opportunity for dramatic change in ussoviet relations

space shuttle discovery was linked 
friday to the two solid fuel booster rockets that are to hurl it 
into space this summer on the first postchallenger shuttle mission 
a giant overhead crane hoisted the 85ton spaceship on a metal 
sling and gingerly guided it into position for mating with the 
126foottall boosters and a 154foot fuel tank that will feed the 
crafts three liquid fuel engines 
nasa workers then made electrical fuel line and other 
connections on sunday they will begin testing the connections 
barring problems discovery will be transported to the launch 
pad in the glare of powerful floodlights friday starting at 1201 
am the ships fiveman astronaut crew and nasa officials will 
participate in the rollout ceremony from a flagbedecked grandstand 
outside the shuttle assembly building 
forrest mccartney director of the kennedy space center will 
present the astronauts with an autograph book which they will carry 
into space on their fourday mission the book contains the 
signatures of the 15000 center workers here who have labored to 
return the shuttle fleet to space 
mccartney has invited center workers and their families to drive 
their personal cars onto the spaceport that day for a drive around 
the launch pad to view discovery there 
discoverys linkup with the boosters was delayed more than a day 
while engineers overcame a problem with a mechanism controlling the 
landing wheel doors in discoverys nose 
the shuttle was moved into the assembly building tuesday after 
undergoing an extensive overhaul of several of its systems many of 
the changes the result of the challenger explosion that killed 
seven astronauts shortly after liftoff on jan 28 1986 
the disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of challengers 
solid fuel boosters the joint has been redesigned and has passed 
four testfirings with one more set for july 26 before discovery 
is cleared for flight 
the three main engines also must undergo a preflight test that 
20second firing with discovery bolted on the pad is set for july 
22 
the current launch target date is sept 3 but officials say 
there is a chance liftoff could occur in late august 
during the flight commander rick hauck and his crew will deploy 
a communications satelite conduct science and technology 
experimets and test modifications made to the shuttle the other 
crew members are dick covey mike lounge george nelson and david

an american engineer went on trial friday 
for the murder of a spanish prostitute last year and he said he 
remembered only punching her in the nose during an argument over 
money 
the prosecution said david baxter of st louis an engineer with 
mcdonnell douglas corp smothered rufina sanz a 35yearold 
madrid prostitute in his hotel room and mutilated her body on 
march 3 1987 
baxter 30 came to spain two days before the murder to work on 
a joint mcdonnell douglasspanish government project set up in 
1983 after spain agreed to buy 72 f18 fighter bombers from the 
st louisbased company 
a forensic report said sanz died of asphyxiation from having a 
foot pressed across her throat 
the report also said she was beaten and disfigured with a knife 
before being thrown from a window onto a cement patio 
the prosecution cited psychiatric reports indicating baxter 
suffered from a psychosexual illness of a sadistic nature that 
led him to commit the murder 
the prosecution said it considered baxters illness an 
extenuating circumstance that kept it from seeking the maximum 
penalty of a 30year prison term it asked for a 20year prison 
term in the event of conviction 
baxters defense attorney julian perez templado cited the same 
psychosexual illness outlined in the reports as evidence his client 
could not be held responsible for his acts 
baxter dressed in a blue suit and handcuffed testified he met 
sanz and returned with her to his hotel room after drinking at 
several bars late on march 2 1987 
he said he hit her in the nose in his room after they argued 
over the price he was to pay for sexual favors 
baxter said he could not remember what happened after that he

a sharply divided supreme court ruled friday 
that children from poor families do not have a constitutional right 
to free bus transportation to and from school 
the 54 decision in a case from north dakota has particular 
importance for people in rural areas the ruling was denounced by 
the dissenters for denying hope and equal opportunity to the 
disadvantaged 
the courts majority however said north dakota officials acted 
rationally and lawfully in permitting local school districts to 
charge busing fees 
in other decisions the court 
limited severely states authority to lower the electric rates 
public utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal 
regulators the 63 ruling will cost mississippi consumers 3265 
million 
voted 54 to uphold an illinois mans murder conviction ruling 
that its famous miranda decision is sufficient to protect the 
rights of defendants questioned by police after they are indicted 
or otherwise formally charged 
ruled 63 that state and federal officials may not be sued 
for monetary damages by people whose social security disability 
benefits were cut off unlawfully 
by a 63 vote limited the governments broad immunity from 
negligence lawsuits the court reinstated a suit by a couple shot 
at by a drunken offduty navy medic in maryland 
restricted the power of federal judges to dismiss criminal 
charges when prosecutors violate a law requiring speedy trial of 
defendants the 63 ruling reinstated the indictment in seattle of 
a man accused of cocaine trafficking 
relaxed the deadlines prison inmates face when seeking to 
appeal their cases in federal appellate court the 54 decision 
revived the appeal of a convicted murderer serving a 50year 
sentence in tennessee 
ruled 81 against a worker in california who was dropped from 
a racediscrimination suit against his company and labor union 
because of a clerical error 
in the busing case justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the 
court that states generally have a free hand in deciding whether 
families must pay to get their children to school 
a states decision to allow local school boards the option of 
charging patrons a user fee for bus service is constitutionally 
permissible she said the constitution does not require that 
such service be provided at all and it is difficult to imagine why 
choosing to offer the service should entail a constitutional 
obligation to offer it for free 
the ruling is in line with earlier court decisions upholding 
laws that treat the wealthy and poor differently for example the 
court has upheld the use of property taxes to support public 
schools even though children from less affluent communities may 
suffer the court has said such laws are permissible if they serve 
a rational purpose 
but in a dissenting opinion friday justice thurgood marshall 
said for the poor education is often the only route by which to 
become full participants in our society in allowing a state to 
burden the access of poor persons to an education the court denies 
equal opportunity and discourages hope 
justices william j brennan john paul stevens and harry a 
blackmun also dissented 
north dakota law provides free bus transportation to those 
living in districts that have reorganized to broaden their tax base 
and improve education only those districts that have not 
reorganized are allowed to charge parents for busing their children 
the law was intended to spur consolidation and assure people in 
reorganized districts they would not have to pay for transportation 
the court said the law is a rational approach to encouraging 
local school officials to reorganize 
the law was challenged by paula kadrmas from rural dickinson 
nd she said the it denied equal rights to her daughter sarita 
because the family could not afford a 97 annual bus fee 
mrs kadrmas has driven sarita the 16 miles to school rather 
than pay the fee ironically oconnor noted that meant the family 
spent more than 1000 in 198586 to get sarita to and from school 
bus service in dickinson is offered for a fee to elementary 
school students who live more than three miles from school and to 
high school students who live more than four miles away

lush green mountainsides in southern 
vermont have been scarred with patches of brown the work of tiny 
insects that are threatening the states maple sugar industry and 
tourism 
a bug known as the pear thrips is blamed for damaging nearly 
500000 acres of forest in vermont this year by comparison 21000 
acres were damaged last year said h brenton teillon chief of 
forest protection for the state department of forests and parks 
officials say the bugs that attacked millions of maple trees 
this spring are the states worst insect problem in more than 25 
years the current drought is putting still further stress on trees 
the maples are a source of income for hundreds of vermonters who 
tap them to produce syrup and sugar candy the state produced 
370000 gallons of maple syrup this year leading the nation and 
that generated 125 million in income 
the loss of a significant portion some foresters fear up to a 
fifth of the maples could also mean far fewer dollars this fall 
from tourists who come to view the foliage 
from a window in a fourseat plane state forester pete 
norkeveck assessed the damage over bennington on thursday 
afternoon some forestland had retained its brilliant green but 
there were wide swaths of shriveled brown foliage with tints of 
gray and orange 
those trees are in real trouble says norkeveck if we 
dont get some rain in the next couple of weeks were looking at a 
very high mortality rate even with some rain a lot of them might 
not survive 
pear thrips have been in the united states since the early part 
of the century but historically they have been a problem mainly in 
orchards 
norkeveck said the pear thrips attack a trees flowers in early 
spring the bugs then enter a period of dormance 
experts are unsure why the problem flared up this year they 
cite a variety of possible factors including the drought a 
heavierthannormal blooming of the maples this spring and a cold 
snap at a key time this spring that may have been a boon to the 
insects 
bob twitchell of landgrove said he was one of the first maple 
growers to be affected he first saw the defoliation in the early 
summer of 1985 to reduce stress on the maples on his 60acres he 
decided not to tap his trees the following spring losing his main 
source of income for a year 
if you dont tap for one year you dont have the resources to 
continue he said a lot of people just do it as a parttime 
thing and they dont depend on it as much but if i let up for one 
year im done for 
the problem has grown only worse 
it looks like winter theres nothing there he said i 
just dont know as theres anything i can do 
hes given up sugaring completely for lumbering and talks of 
selling off some of his property to make ends meet 
a similar sense of worry and uncertainty was evident thursday 
among 50 maple sugar producers landowners state and canadian 
officials who met in bennington to discuss the problem 
to a lesser degree the infestation has also affected parts of 
other new england states new york and pennsylvania foresters said

the environmental protection agency has 
recommended permanently relocating people living near a 
superfund hazardous waste site for only the fourth time in the 
nation and the first time in new england 
there is no immediate health threat to the residents of a mobile 
home park built on the site of the former dump but the site is a 
chemical time bomb that needs to be cleaned up epa deputy 
regional administrator paul keough said thursday 
there are other sites that certainly rank high from a 
potential pollution standpoint said mike deland an epa regional 
administrator there is no other site in vermont or new england 
that has people living on top of it 
epa remedial project site manager paula fitzsimmons said the two 
main classes of hazardous chemicals in the dump are polychlorinated 
byphenyls or pcbs which are suspected of causing cancer and 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or pahs basically oil and 
petroleumbased products 
keough said there was a significant longterm potential for air 
soil and leachate contamination if residents remained and the site 
were not cleaned up 
in addition he said the area posed a threat to residents who 
might inadvertently dig up contaminated soil while planting a 
garden for example 
officials said they will hold public hearings on the cleanup 
proposal with relocation to begin after a final agreement is 
signed possibly in september 
about 60 people live at the springfield mobile estates park 
some really dont want to move theyre most elderly said 
resident christine chapman there are those who tried to sell and 
couldnt a couple of years ago because nobody would buy it on top 
of toxic waste site theyre relieved 
the epa estimated the cost of the cleanup and relocation to be 
at least 125 million and to take 2 years 
the site would be dug up covered with a protective cap and 
fenced off as soon as all residents are moved leachate or 
contaminated groundwater would also be collected and treated 
officials said the site would be checked every five years for 30 
years to determine if the cleanup technology is working 
although the pcbs were not dumped in bulk the pahs were dumped 
by huge tankers these and other wastes were left at site from 1946 
to 1968

cplus student

rescue workers dug in a 20foot layer of 
mud and rocks friday for about 100 people buried by a landslide 
using sniffer dogs and dodging boulders that skittered down the 
mountain 
a truck driver and a resident were injured by the new rockslides 
that pelted down on what remains of this village in the rainsoaked 
mountains above the black sea port of trabzon 
its too soon to give up hope of finding people alive but i 
think we will soon be discovering bodies said klaus kolter a 
member of the west german rescue dog association helping in the 
search for victims of thursdays disaster well keep on trying 
rescue workers abandoned plans for an allnight search because 
of fears of a new major landslide the operation was to resume at 
dawn saturday 
heres a risk that an entire hilltop could come crashing down 
in the same area cracks already have been observed but its not 
possible to predict when it might happen said erkan omarbeyoglu 
turkeys general director of highways 
he said that if a new landslide occurred during daylight hours 
the rescue teams would have time to evacuate 
three west german tourists were among those missing in the 
landslide which residents of catak blamed in inadequate 
buttressing of the walls of the highway that runs through the 
village 
members of the west german team wearing red coveralls took 21 
sniffer dogs over mounds of earth covering a coffeehouse a 
restaurant 20 homes and a high school that had been closed for 
summer vacation 
earthmovers cleared loose debris and a team of 50 civil defense 
workers dug in spots where the reactions of the dogs indicated 
survivors might be trapped in air pockets beneath boulders 
more than 30 hours after hundreds of tons of mud and rock roared 
down on catak only one body had been recovered 
villagers said at least 30 bus passengers were in the 
coffeehouse when the landslide occurred having breakfast and while 
bulldozers cleared a rockfall that had blocked the highway the 
night before dozens more waited at the roadside they said 
my friends were in the coffeehouse id gone back outside to 
see if the bus was ready to leave and i saw a telegraph pole slowly 
bending over said gaby engeler 28 a nurse from west germany 
i heard a noise like an explosion and the whole hillside came 
away in front of me 
she identified her friends as birgit hastenteufel a 25yearold 
social worker and andreas burghard 28 a pharmacist the third 
missing west german was identified only as markus mutter 
enver hizlan the provincial governor told reporters 26 turks 
were listed as missing but the number was likely to rise because 
the people involved were in transit and it would take time for 
relatives to contact authorities 
catak is a straggling village of about 1000 people bisected by 
the main highway from trabzon to eastern anatolia and iran it is 
in a region of hazelnut and cherry orchards about 20 miles from the 
black sea near the ruins of the byzantine monastery of surmela a 
major tourist attraction 
the twolane highwy was widened three years ago because of 
increasing truck and tourist traffic but villagers said it was not 
buttressed properly 
the retaining walls werent big enough and we started having 
landslides not big ones but enough to block the road said riza 
yavuz the village headman 
he said construction teams tried to shore up the overhang but 
three weeks ago the coffeehouse owner complained again to the 
public works people but he was told the highway was safe 
villagers were camping out in tents friday and eating meals 
provided by the turkish red crescent the moslem equivalent of the 
red cross many spent the day on an opposite slope watching the 
rescue efforts some weeping as they waited for news of missing 
relatives 
i keep telling myself hes still alive but when i look at the 
earth and the stones its hard to be convinced said hussein 
aksoy whose son hassan is a driver and had stopped in the coffee 
house on his way back to trabzon

the united states on friday rebuffed a soviet 
proposal for an exchange of data on conventional forces in europe 
calling it a fruitless exercise that would perpetuate a 13year 
stalemate on the issue 
instead both sides should clear away diplomatic hurdles barring 
the start of actual force reduction talks state department 
spokesman charles e redman said 
the spokesman was reacting to recent statements by soviet 
leaders on reducing the massive armies that have confronted each 
other across europes eastwest dividing line since world war ii 
the latest soviet comments on the subject came at the united 
nations on thursday when lt gen konstantin f mikhailov deputy 
chief of the foreign ministrys disarmament directorate repeated 
moscows willingness to make greater reductions than the west in 
some conventional forces 
the united states which for years has complained of massive 
soviet superiority in tanks artillery and other weapons has said 
the elimination of these asymmetries in the balance is a 
necessary ingredient of conventional disarmament 
mikhailov said that as a first step toward identifying the 
imbalances the two sides should exchange official data on the 
size of their forces 
redman noted however that the main sticking point in the 
viennabased mutual and balanced force reduction talks that have 
been deadlocked since the mid1970s is the inability of the two 
sides to agree on forcesize data already exchanged 
the soviet call for an initial data exchange in advance of and 
unrelated to specific proposals is a recipe for the kind of 
fruitless data dispute which has plagued the mbfr talks for many 
years redman said 
the problem in those talks has been stalemate over the 
inability to agree on figures the us spokesman said 
warsaw pact and north atlantic treaty organization nations have 
agreed in principle to shift the conventional arms talks away from 
mbfr which deals only with central europe to a new set of 
discussions involving more nations and covering forces throughout 
the continent 
the two blocs have failed so far to establish a mandate for 
the new talks because the united states and its allies want the 
discussions to include human rights issues and some warsaw pact 
countries want to restrict the agenda to military matters 
earlier this year the reagan administration was saying it hoped 
to establish the framework for the talks by the end of the summer 
but optimism has dimmed because of continuing disagreement 
we encourage the soviets to complete the task at hand

settlement movement said the arabs would interpret the gesture as 
a sign of weakness 
as long as the uprising continues our policy must be 
much much more aggressive katzover said on israel radio the 
arabs understand by these gestures that israeli accepts the current 
situation or is unable to cope with it

tugboats carrying police and soldiers 
towed a usregistered oil tanker back to dockside friday after 
protesters had tried to use it to block visiting british warships 
on thursday shipyard workers sympathetic to the opposition 
socialist party towed the 80000ton copper mountain to the mouth 
of vallettas grand harbor and left it there 
no crewmen were aboard the copper mountain at the time the 
vessel identified as owned by the point vale company of delaware 
had been in drydock for months while the shipyard awaited payment 
for repairs 
the socialists oppose the warships port call scheduled for 
saturday saying that three of the ships carry nuclear arms and 
that the visit would violate the tiny mediterranean islands policy 
of neutrality and nonalignment 
the general workers union of malta which backs the socialists 
on friday called a strike to protest the port call the union 
covers 7000 employees in maltas drydocks and shipbuilding areas 
and some 2000 in other sectors 
the police who brought the tanker back to berth hired two 
private tugs since pilots of the staterun tugboats refused to work 
in protest of the british visit 
the maltese parliament on thursday approved a motion reaffirming 
that nuclear arms should not be allowed on maltese territory and 
declaring that other nations should respect this policy 
earlier thursday in an effort to block the arrival of any 
protesters ships the prowest nationalist government gave notice 
that a specific port permit would be needed to enter the harbor 
during the weekend 
the ships led by the aircraft carrier ark royal were to stop 
in malta on their way to australia for bicentennial celebrations in 
the commonwealth nation

the united states and its major trading 
partners remained far apart friday on the contentious issue of farm 
subsidies but negotiators reported progress in other areas aimed 
at reducing protectionist pressures 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said differences had 
been narrowed in a number of areas including the procedures to 
expand the compact that governs world trade to include services and 
investments two areas not now covered 
we havent solved all of the problems but we believe we have 
come a long way in achieving consensus yeutter said 
his remarks came at a news conference that closed the two days 
of meetings involving trade ministers from the united states 
japan canada and the 12member european community 
the discussions were held as part of continuing negotiations to 
expand and strengthen the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
known as gatt 
the united states has made the elimination of all farm subsidies 
by the year 2000 its major goal in the gatt talks but president 
reagan faced stiff opposition when he discussed his proposal 
earlier this week at the sevennation economic summit in toronto 
the summit countries ended up directing their trade negotiators 
to work harder to narrow their differences in preparation for a 
critical meeting of all 96 member nations of gatt in montreal in 
december 
the differences on farm subsidies are so great that the trade 
negotiators did not even have the issue on their formal agenda for 
the talks held at a resort in the lake country of minnesota 
but the issue did dominate discussions between the bargaining 
sessions and over meals even though no progress was made 
officials said 
the us proposal is opposed by the european community and 
japan which pay high subsidies to their farmers 
even though the major countries of the world are spending 200 
billion annually in the costly subsidy battle the europeans and 
japanese say it is unrealistic to talk about a complete phaseout of 
subsidies they said the discussions should be focused on reducing 
subsidies instead perhaps by cutting them in half 
yeutter hinted that the administration might be willing to back 
off its demand for total elimination of subsidies by the end of the 
century in favor of a longer phaseout period but he would not 
publicly state what compromise the united states might offer 
we are not moving off any options maybe in 1990 we will make 
some adjustments but not in 1988 he said the year 1990 is when 
the current gatt round of trade liberalization talks is scheduled 
to be completed 
yeutter and the other trade ministers tried to be optimistic 
that the farm battle could be resolved 
if you want to make progress you have to work hard and 
consistently said willy de clerq trade minister for the 
european community 
john crosbie canadas trade minister said the trade ministers 
may get together again after the us presidential election nov 8 
but before the montreal meeting in december to work on unresolved 
issues such as agriculture 
yeutter said he was encouraged with the progres between 
negotiators during the two days of talks he said he believed a 
number of contentious issues ahd been resolved which would insure 
substantial progress would be made in montreal 
the ministers agreed in principle to a common position on 
strengthening gatts procedures for settling trade disputes between 
nations by speeding up the process 
yeutter said progress was also made on another reagan priority 
to find methods to increase the unrestricted flow of investment 
around the world as well as some progress in trying to draft rules 
to cover trade in services 
yeutter said the services question was far from being totally 
resolved because of the difficulty of deciding which of 150 
different sectors from telecommunications and banking to 
construction and insurance should be covered by the rules 
this was the 14th bargaining session between the four sides 
which represent the biggest markets in world trade at the talks 
which began in 1983 the participants try to reach agreement among 
themselves and then sell their positions to the other 92 members of 
the gatt organization 
in a show of solidarity all four trade ministers wore tshirts 
at the news conference emblazoned think big the motto for the 
conference which was aimed at promoting a global view of trade and 
combatting protectionist sentiments

syrianbacked guerrillas on friday 
bombarded yasser arafats loyalists in a bloody struggle for 
control of two palestinian refugee camps police said 10 people 
were killed and 34 wounded 
at one point police said five shells a minute were hitting the 
chatilla refugee camp as col saeed mousas radical fatahuprising 
tried to crush arafats fatah guerrillas they said chatillas only 
hospital was hit dozens of times 
a fatah spokesman charged that mousas fighters started 
shelling the camps indiscriminately to sabotage mediation efforts 
by libyan officials they are massacring our people said the 
fatah spokesman who refused to be named 
a truce announced in tripoli on thursday called for the warring 
factions to return to positions they held before fighting broke out 
may 1 in chatilla and the nearby bourj elbarajneh camp it was 
reached in a meeting between libyan officers and representatives of 
neutral palestinian groups 
since may 1 112 people have been killed and 502 wounded in the 
fight for control of the refugee camps on beiruts southern 
outskirts 
a palestinian official said mousas gunners used 240mm mortars 
to shell chatilla the first time they have used the heavy weapons 
in the fighting 
the official quoted a doctor in chatilla as saying most of the 
hospitals medical and surgical equipment were damaged 
were crippled we dont have the means to carry out even 
minor operations even oxygen bottles and gauze supplies have been 
blown up the official quoted the doctor as saying 
fatahuprising said in a statement that arafat provoked the 
clashes to sabotage syrias role in lebanon in order to be 
accepted in the americanzionist arrangements 
syria has 7500 troops deployed in west beirut to control 
unrest last month syria sent 2400 troops into south beirut to 
end a bloodbath between the shiite moslem militias amal and 
hezbollah at least 300 people died in the battle for control of 
the southern slums where western hostages are believed held by 
factions of the proiranian hezbollah 
mortar rounds and rockets fired by fatahuprising gunners were 
raining down on the camps at a rate of five a minute around dawn a 
police spokesman said 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said fatah defenders entrenched in the rubble of the two 
shantytowns responded with heavy weapons fire 
the fighting raged through the day as smoke from burning 
buildings billowed over the camps ambulances evacuated the wounded 
to hospitals in west beirut 
fatah the main component of the palestine liberation 
organization pushed mousas followers out of the camps in earlier 
fighting 
the dissidents regrouped along the syriancontrolled edges of 
the shantytowns have launched several abortive attacks in an 
attempt to regain their lost bases 
the police spokesman said mousas gunners concentrated their 
shelling on the tiny chatilla camp 
they hammered chatilla all day theyre turning whats left of 
the camp into a pile of rubble he said 
the camps have been badly damaged by fighting that began when 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 and besieged west beirut and the 
camps in an attempt to drive out palestinian guerrillas 
proisraeli christian lebanese militiamen massacred hundreds of 
civilians in chatilla and the nearby sabra camp in september 1982 
syrianbacked shiite moslems besieged the beirut camps in 1985 
pounding them for more than two years in an abortive effort to 
prevent arafat from rebuilding the power base he lost when the 
israelis invaded 
what was left of sabra was bulldozed by the shiites but 
chatilla and bourj elbarajneh held out until the shiites lifted 
their siege 
mousa broke away from the plo in 1983 in a syrianbacked mutiny 
by radicals opposed to arafat the latest fighting came despite a 
reconciliation between arafat and syrian president hafez assad in 
damascus last april to end their fiveyear feud over who would 
control the palestinian movement

nato agreed friday to create a 
multinational army unit to replace a 5000man canadian air and sea 
brigade that had been earmarked to reinforce northern norway in 
times of crisis 
the decision caps a year of study and internal nato controversy 
about how to respond to the disbanding of the canadian airsea 
transportable brigade which had been committed to norway for 19 
years 
the norwegian government had criticized the canadian move 
saying failure to replace the brigade would weaken the north 
atlantic treaty organizations ability to stop attacks on its 
northern flank 
canada said in june 1987 it would offset the move by adding to 
its forces in west germany 
the alliances defense planning committee adopted outlines of a 
plan for creating an army unit of us west german and canadian 
troops that would be designated as early reinforcements for norway 
in times of tension 
a nato announcement said gen john r galvin the chief 
commander of alliance forces in europe was negotiating terms of a 
composite force for norway it said details would be worked out 
later 
this will enhance natos overall deterrence in a time of 
tension demonstrate alliance solidarity and reinforce the 
defense of this vitally important region in a crisis the 
announcement said 
the problem of reinforcing northern norway stems from the oslo 
governments longstanding policy of prohibiting the stationing of 
foreign troops on its soil in peacetime it also prohibits alliance 
military maneuvers in the northern finnmark county that borders the 
soviet union 
in oslo prime minister gro harlem bruntland told a news 
conference friday she was pleased with the alliance decision 
the outlined solution represents a net strengthening of the 
allied contribution to the defense of norway she said 
norways concern about the withdrawal of the canadian force has 
been heightened by its fear of growing superpower military strength 
in the north 
besides turkey norway is the only nato member to share a border 
with the soviet union 
a 13000man us marine amphibious brigade and a 5000man 
dutchbritish landing force already are committed to reinforcing 
central norway in wartime 
when the possibility of west german troops being included in a 
replacement unit for the canadian brigade first was raised publicly 
last fall some norwegian press reaction was negative 
nazi troops occupied northern norway for five years and 
destroyed many villages and factories before withdrawing in may 
1945 resentment is still evident in some parts of the sparsely 
populated north 
the day after a foreign press report in september 1987 said 
german combat troops could be returning to northern norway for the 
first time norways most widely read newspaper verdens gang ran 
a photograph of a column of german soldiers above the headline 
unwelcome in norway 
government officials have never suggested they would not accept 
a german contingent in a new multinational reinforcement unit in 
march defense minister johan joergen holst called german 
participation welcome

americans personal income and spending grew 
modestly in may the government reported friday but economists 
said consumer spending likely will weaken this summer as wages lag 
behind inflation 
the commerce department said income rose 03 percent last month 
following a 01 percent gain in april 
meanwhile personal consumption expenditures which include 
virtually everything except interest on debt rose a moderate 05 
percent in may following a 04 percent increase in april 
john hagens an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa consulting firm described the spending increase as sort of 
run of the mill translating into a real annual growth rate of 
about 25 percent after the 03 percent rise in consumer prices in 
may is taken into consideration 
i think basically our biggest concern is how weak consumer 
spending is the income growth is simply not there to support 
much growth particularly given higher food prices expected because 
of the drought he said i dont think well get 25 percent 
this summer 
through the first five years of the sixyear economic expansion 
consumer buying has fueled the growth now analysts are looking 
for exports and sale of equipment to businesses to drive the 
economy 
americans disposable income what they have left after paying 
taxes shot up 15 percent in may after a 10 percent drop in 
april that was the largest decline in a year 
that was the result of the big tax bite the government takes on 
april 15 personal tax payments fell at an annual rate of 352 
billion in may after rising 369 billion in april 
in all personal incomes rose 133 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted annual level of 395 trillion 
the report said both the april and may increases look weaker 
because march income was boosted by profitsharing payments to ford 
motor co workers and retroactive social security payments also a 
lag in federal payments to farmers held back the may advance 
excluding those special factors the government said personal 
income would have advanced 08 percent in april and 04 percent in 
may 
americans saved 1519 billion in may compared with 1196 
billion in april boosting the personal savings rate to 45 percent 
from 36 percent 
the april savings rate was unusually low because of income tax 
payments on average americans have been saving 44 percent of 
their income so far this year compared with a rate of 37 percent 
last year 
hagens said the rate could decline this summer as consumer dip 
into their savings to bolster purchasing power eroded by inflation 
but he said that likely would be only temporary and cannot support 
consumer spending in the long run 
wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 122 billion in 
may after an 118 billion increase in april farm income fell 24 
billion last month following an 119 billion drop in april 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years decreased 15 billion 
last month following a 79 billion april increase purchases of 
nondurable goods rose 76 billion following a 51 billion 
decrease 
purchases of services which includes housing costs rose 96 
billion following a 108 billion increase

police kept guard around burmas holiest 
buddhist shrine friday after student protesters had abandoned the 
hilltop pagoda 
pilgrims who entered the spawling shwedagon pagoda after it was 
reopened friday said they found no trace of the demonstrators 
traffic increased in rangoon and all markets were open 
although fewer shoppers were seen police also kept tight security 
around other temples in the capital 
nine people were killed in the week of studentled street 
violence officials said the government imposed a dusktodawn 
curfew closed institutions of higher learning and prohibited all 
public meetings 
buddhist pilgrims reported thursday that students had moved into 
the shrine a centuriesold marvel of golden spires and stupas to 
set up a strike center that would coordinate antigovernment 
protests 
pagoda trustees who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
university students arrived in groups at the shrine wednesday 
afternoon and probably mingled with worshippers before the 6 pm 
government curfew 
the students were also said to have left later that day though 
it was not clear whether they too were observing the curfew or 
departed for some other reason 
the trustees said security officials searched the temple grounds 
wednesday night and barred public access thursday 
the weeks protests also forced the suspension of classes at 
schools in mandalay the countrys secondlargest city 
antigovernment protests also have been reported in pegu north of 
rangoon and in moulmein on the southeastern seacoast 
since october the 26yearold regime of strongman u ne win has 
been rocked by three violent protests in rangoon and smaller ones 
in other parts of the country 
diplomatic and other sources says lack of personal freedoms and 
a downward spiraling economy are fueling unrest 
buddhist pagodas in burma have traditionally been centers of 
political protest in 1920 rangoon students moved into the 
shwedagon grounds to launch agitation against the british then 
burmas colonial rulers 
the posting of guards at sule botataung and other shrines was 
viewed as a measure to prevent activists from entering the buddhist 
holy places where violence of any kind is forbidden 
last week students at several institutions had peacefully 
demonstrated for release of detained students and legalization of 
student unions violence broke out after the government responded 
by closing the schools 
on tuesday about 5000 students and other protesters fought 
police with stones 
last march police and military units brutally suppressed a 
similar demonstration arresting hundreds and killing what western 
diplomats put at possibly up to 100 protesters

the government has refused to give a 
passport to a prominent kenyan lawyer who was invited to the united 
states to be honored by the american bar association a newspaper 
reported friday 
the standard newspaper wrote that gibson kamau kuria hopes to be 
honored in absentia 
kurias passport was confiscated when he was detained feb 26 
1987 a day after he filed a petition challenging the detention 
without charge of two lawyers and a university lecturer 
joseph p griffin aba chairman invited kuria to receive a 
citation for his work in promoting respect for and observance of 
the rule of law he was to leave june 12 and return june 26 
kuria told griffin in a letter made available to the associated 
press that an immigration official had informed him the government 
only returns held passports when it decides the holder can travel 
outside kenya 
that policy is in conflict with the kenyan law which governs 
the return of passports held by public authorities kuria said 
the kenyan law requires that authorities repossess passports 
only for a specific reason and for a specified period 
like his clients kuria was held under a law that allows 
indefinite detention without charge 
president daniel arap moi freed kuria dec 12 and the attorney 
rejoined his partners in a nairobi law firm

democrat michael dukakis all but ruled 
out bill bradley as a prospective running mate on friday saying 
the new jersey senator had told the campaign he wasnt interested 
and adding i respect that 
beginning a fourday vacation at a borrowed vacation home on 
nantucket island dukakis said bradley had told paul brountas the 
dukakis senior adviser who is leading his search for vice 
presidential candidate that he apparently wasnt interested 
in any event were going to keep in touch dukakis said 
he said rival jesse jackson reported to have said privately he 
would turn down the vice presidential nomination had not sent that 
word to the dukakis campaign 
i dont know anything about that he said of the jackson 
report in the boston globe which was attributed to unnamed sources 
dukakis the massachusetts governor who is awaiting the 
presidential nomination at the democratic national convention next 
month said that if any of the prospective vice presidential 
candidates ruled themselves out clearly and unequivocally to me 
then obviously im not going to press the point 
i might push a little bit if somebody seemed to me to be a 
good prospect he said but if they came back and said look 
weve thought about it we decided this isnt the time 
he was asked if that was the case with bradley a senator who 
has campaigned with dukakis and is clearly a personal favorite of 
the governor 
well apparently so he said we havent talked personally 
about it hes somebody i have a lot of respect for apparently 
he said that to paul and i respect that 
dukakis flew to nantucket island off cape cod with his wife 
kitty he said he plans to read and relax over the weekend before 
returning to boston on monday evening 
mrs dukakis is recovering from spinal surgery she underwent 
three weeks ago she wore a plumcolored scarf around a neck brace 
when she and her husband appeared before reporters and 
photographers on the lawn of the picturesque home where they are 
staying she took off her neck brace briefly to show the scar left 
by the operation 
want to see my scar she said drawing laughs from the crowd 
of reporters 
the couple is staying at a brown woodframe colonial home 
overlooking an inlet off nantucket harbor the home where the 
dukakises have stayed before is situated up a treelined drive and 
not visible from the road 
the home is owned by bernard and grace grossman famiily friends 
for some 20 years bernard grossman is a former executive of a 
wellknown bostonarea lumber company 
unlike repulican nomineetobe george bush who owns a shoreside 
family estate at kennebunkport maine dukakis owns no vacation 
home 
the governor relaxed on a lounge chair while wearing a cotton 
sweater pants and deck shoes without socks rarely is he seen in 
public without his usual attire a suit and black wingtipped shoes 
its an incredible place he said looking at the view and 
recalling that he and kitty came to nantucket on their honeymoonn 
25 years ago weve been coming back ever since 
he said it was to nantucket that they came in the fall of 1978 
after he lost a bid for reelection to heal our wounds 
he said this time he brought two bags of reading material and 
planned to spend his four days reading and walking 
he had little to say about the series of events that buffeted 
his campaign over the past several days including the disclosure 
that the fbi is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the states 
decision to locate a new prison on land owned by longtime 
acquaintances of the governor he said he planned no investigation 
of the case by the governors office 
he again defended his decision to sign a bill imposing a 5 
percent increase in the state tax on cigarettes as a move to 
counter the state revenue shortfall pointing to previous tax cuts 
weve run into this rather modest shortfall and when you do 
that you have to respond to it he said 
dukakis provided little insight to his vice presidential 
deliberations beyond his comments on bradley theres no list 
he said were trying to expand the circle as broadly as 
possible 
aides said he planned no meetings or serious discussions on the 
vice presidential choice during his vacation brountas did not 
accompany him to the island and campaign manager susan estrich 
flew home to los angeles for the weekend

an army special operations helicopter was 
forced to ditch in the persian gulf after encountering mechanical 
problems pentagon officials disclosed friday 
the thursday night incident the first involving one of the 
secret mh6 copters in the gulf occurred during a routine patrol 
and did not involve any hostile fire officials said 
both crewmen escaped injury and were picked up later in good 
condition the pentagon said the helicopter sank 
lt col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman said the 
incident occurred shortly before midnight local time or around 4 
pm edt thursday he identified the craft only as a us 
helicopter operating in the central persian gulf on a routine 
surveillance mission 
but other officials who asked not to be identified said the 
helicopter was an mh6 flying from one of two large barges moored 
in the northern persian gulf 
the barges are used to support minesweeping vessels as well as 
a number of special operations aircraft and commando teams and 
also as bases for surveillance missions to keep track of iranian 
gunboats the navy and defense department officially refuse to 
acknowledge their existence 
the mh6 is a small fast reconnaissance aircraft that has been 
armed with several sophisticated weapons and nighttime sensors and 
modified to fly with little noise a derivative of a bubblecanopy 
copter designed by hughes aircraft it is thought to be flown by 
only one unit of the armys special operations forces based at 
fort campbell ky 
since arriving for gulf duty the copters have at times been 
referred to by the nickname sea bat and also as ah6s the army 
does not discuss the helicopter 
the helicopters were ferried to the gulf last summer not long 
after the us navy began protecting reflagged kuwaiti tankers in 
the gulf kuwait a key ally of iraq in the iraniraq war 
requested the protection after iran began singling out the vessels 
for attack 
former defense secretary caspar w weinberger acknowledged the 
helicopters presence in the gulf after one of them intercepted and 
attacked an iranian navy ship the iran ajr as it sowed mines in 
international waters of the gulf last sept 21 
pentagon sources said friday they were certain an effort would 
be made to raise the downed helicopter depending upon the depth 
of the water there 
and we would very definitely like to have it back one

jello before falling asleep

greenpeace activists tied a yellow 
float to the anchor of a us ship friday to protest the alleged 
presence of nuclear weapons at the american base here 
the protest provoked a skirmish with american patrol boats who 
used hoses to douse antinuclear activists on the small craft 
greenpeace said the protest was to highlight claims that 
nucleartipped tomahawk sealaunched cruise missiles have been 
deployed at the base 
the greenpeace ship sirius entered the base and launched two 
small rubber craft toward the moored submarine tender frank cable 
protesters then attached a large yellow float emblazoned with the 
words nuclear free seas to the ships anchor chain according 
to steve morgan a british photographer recording the event for 
greenpeace 
two us tugboats one italian tugboat and three patrol boats 
two american and one italian moved in according to a statement 
issued by the group in rome 
the us patrol boats doused two women on the yellow submarine 
with fire hoses and rammed the float boathooks and knives were 
used to puncture it and untie it from the frank cable said morgan 
he said the women braved the hose blasts and retied the partly 
deflated float to the tender but they were finally forced to 
paddle the crippled craft back to the mother ship 
there were no arrests or injuries the group said 
officials of the us embassy in rome had no comment on the 
episode other than to acknowledge that it occurred no one answered 
the phone at the base commanders office at la maddalena 
a greenpeace spokesman mike ross said the action was prompted 
by evidence obtained by researchers in washington allegedly proving 
that the frank cable has been carrying nucleartipped tomahawk 
cruise missile since 1985 
a us navy spokesman in naples lt david morris said it is 
us policy neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear 
weapons on any naval vessel 
former italian defense minister giovanni spadolini has denied

producers vowed friday to tape a new fall tv 
season despite the 3to1 rejection of their latest contract offer 
to scriptwriters but the union said its walkout would keep 
hollywood paralyzed 
as the strike continued in its 16th week layoff notices began 
almost simultaneously with the announcement of the voting results 
thursday at universal studios a memo to employees announced that 
the commissary was closing friday 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers offer 
was turned down 2789 to 933 the 9000member writers guild of 
america voted wednesday night during spirited meetings in los 
angeles and new york that injected a renewed dose of union 
solidarity 
if we have to strike for two years well do it said scott 
frank a writer on the television series plainclothes 
debut of the fall season has already been delayed to at least 
midoctober and there were harsh words from producers who had 
described the offer as their final one 
weve finished talking we wont go back said alliance 
spokesman herb steinberg adding that production of some fall tv 
shows will begin after the july 4 holiday he wouldt elaborate how 
the producers hoped to find nonunion scriptwriters or lure guild 
members into crossing picket lines 
we have some things ready to go steinberg said we are 
very optimistic we will have new shows for the fall season 
but guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden dismissed the chances of any 
meaningful startup 
they were claiming they would attempt to produce with scab 
writers she said we dont think that will be any significant 
help to them no one is crossing the lines 
we dont think they can increase production to any extent 
virtually all fall programming is idled by the work stoppage 
the exceptions are some independently produced shows that have 
signed guild contracts including the cosby show and the 
tonight show with johnny carson 
guild president george kirgo leading hundreds of union members 
on a picket line friday outside the nbctv studios in burbank said 
six more independent companies immediately signed contracts with 
the guild after the union vote 
steinberg vowing to do everything we can to get the town back 
to work said it will be next week before producers can determine 
the extent of the production startup 
if we cant get it all going there will be layoffs he 
said we have been holding some people on the payroll hoping the 
writers would come to their senses now that they are dug in we 
have to reassess that 
leaders of a dissident guild faction that had favored the pact 
pledged not to cross picket lines kirgo said but one of the 
dissidents said he was unhappy the walkout was continuing 
i believe the strike of 1988 will become the guilds own 
vietnam war writer rift fournier told daily variety 
its disastrous for the entire business said paul junger 
witt a member of the guild and coexecutive producer of the 
golden girls and beauty and the beast 
dan slusser senior vice president and general manager of 
universal city studios inc called the unions vote devastating 
weve already made a number of cutbacks in the tv and studio 
operations group 
the union went on strike march 7 over the issues of payments for 
reruns of onehour shows and programs broadcast in foreign markets 
the problem issue is in the economic area residuals 
domestic and foreign ms rhoden said 
producers claim the fouryear package offered would be worth an 
extra 71 million to writers and contains an acrosstheboard 
increase in residuals of 147 percent payments to writers at 
present total about 360 million a year steinberg said

some people are claiming the radio code name 
pontiac that the secret service uses for democrat jesse 
jackson has racial overtones but a secret service spokesman said 
friday that jackson does not think its racist 
the secret service gave jackson the code name when the agency 
began protecting him as a presidential candidate last fall secret 
service agents use the code names in their radio transmissions as 
they track the movements of the candidates 
jackson aides tried to trace why jackson had been assigned that 
name after learning that folklore expert alan dundes had said 
pontiac is a slur the punch line to a series of racist jokes 
collected by his students at the university of california 
berkeley said jacksons national political director frank watkins 
pontiac usually associated with a car and a city in michigan 
is also an acronym for poor old nigger thinks its a cadillac 
dundes told the philadelphia inquirer which alerted the campaign 
and the secret service to the allegation 
the campaign uncovered no proof of racial motivation in the 
assigning of jacksons code name but watkins stated 
given this administrations civil rights record and what weve 
heard as to the mentality they have toward black people 
absolutely nothing would surprise me 
however secret service spokesman bob snow that when the service 
was first questioned about the matter by a reporter a few weeks 
ago the agents immediately went to jackson and asked him if he 
considered the name racist and if he wanted a new one 
we asked him if he had a problem with it and he said 
absolutely not snow said 
watkins concurred that neither he nor jackson knew of pontiac in 
a racial context but said jackson asked his staff to look into the 
matter some blacks watkins subsequently talked to recalled it as a 
racial slur from their childhood 
the name originated on a list of dozens of names provided to the 
secret service by the white house communications agency a branch 
of the military assigned to serve the white house and secret 
service according to snow 
snow said the service chooses code names from the random list 
for their utilitarian attributes though sometimes the codes appear 
to fit characteristics of the candidates or government officials 
president reagan has a cowboystyle code rawhide 
deacon is used for jimmy carter a bornagain christian and 
jacksons 1984 code name was thunder which appeared to reflect 
his thunderous oratory 
snow said when people in the agencys communications division 
were questioned about pontiac they didnt know what we were 
talking about 
they said that was the name we selected because that was the 
name we picked 
snow said the service generally tries to give all candidates in 
a given year code names beginning with the same letter such as 
gov michael dukakis code name peso 
he noted some people think that name was chosen because dukakis 
is short and speaks spanish 
im sure nobody in our communications department knew that mr 
dukakis speaks spanish he said 
however he acknowledged that when the service narrows down the 
names to fit its needs such as not having similar sounding names 
that will get confused on radio airwaves there are still many to 
choose from and he could not put myself inside somebodys mind 
who actually made the selection 
he said the matter was brought up at a secret service staff 
meeting and no one related pontiac to a racial slur 
dundes said the meaning of jacksons code name was obvious to 
him when he discovered jacksons code name by reading a news 
magazine article 
dundes said there are five or six versions of the pontiac joke 
which has been around for about 10 years the most basic one he 
said involves the riddle of why a black man buys a pontiac instead 
of a cadillac 
dundes said his students and field researchers had collected 
many examples of the pontiac joke

swarms of locusts migrating from northwest africa 
will threaten harvests in 15 african nations and it will require 
about 300 million in aid to make up for damaged crops un 
officials said friday 
there is actually little hope of being able to contain the 
plague in the near future the directorgeneral of the un food 
and agriculture organization edouard saouma said in a statement 
saouma said the invasion was of unprecedented dimensions and 
will move through the subsahara region to affect the food 
security of 15 african countries from the atlantic ocean to the 
red sea 
dr lukas brader head of the emergency center for locust 
operations at fao said the insects moved south in april and may 
earlier than expected because plentiful rains there resulted in 
favorable breeding and living conditions 
he said the situation will worsen during the next few weeks as 
new swarms arrive coinciding with the harvest in the sahel the 
area that extends from senegal to the sudan and separates the arid 
sahara from tropical west africa 
brader said countries in this region face a potential loss of 1 
million tons of grains about 300 million worth of food aid would 
be required to make up for the destroyed crops he said 
un experts have said a swarm covering just half a square mile 
can contain 50 million insects weigh 100 tons and eat its weight 
in vegetation each day 
brader said that morocco algeria and tunisia which were first 
infested with the locusts had succeeded in keeping the insects 
south of the atlas mountains in relatively uncultivated areas 
he added that since jan 1 123 million acres in those 
countries and mauritania have been treated with pesticides 
in the sahel locust control is more difficult because the 
insects are more dispersed 
saouma said in his statement that locust swarms were sighted in 
sudan this week and that it must now be feared the plague will 
extend to the red sea where it may invade the arabian peninsula 
and the horn of africa 
if unchecked the swarms eventually could reach israel and 
turkey as well as the indian subcontinent 
authorities try to control locusts mainly by spraying pesticides 
the fight has cost 45 million so far this year and the 
organization estimates a total of 150 million may be needed for 
the year 
the last major invasion of locusts in africa began in 1950 and 
lasted for 13 years

a group of veterans trying to take food and 
medicine to nicaragua protested friday at the state department but 
officials refused to meet with them over an order barring their 
battered convoy of trucks and buses from leaving the country 
police blocked the circular drive in front of the state 
department after several trucks and vans plastered with slogans and 
bumper stickers such as children need rainbows not rambos 
rolled past the diplomatic entrance 
more than a dozen officers were called to keep the chanting 
members of the veterans peace convoy away from the doors of the 
building 
when veterans decide to wage peace they cant handle it if 
we were carrying bombs or weapons for the contras the would have 
let us right on in said hal muskat of san francisco 
if we were working for former presidential aide ollie north 
we would have walked right across but if were bringing food and 
medicine to children and trucks to transport it across that 
country they dont want to hear from us 
state department officials told one member of the group who was 
allowed inside stephen somerstein of new york that the convoy 
should take its case instead to the justice department 
theres no justice there shouted one member of the group of 
veterans most of them from the vietnam war they should change 
it to the criminal department 
state department spokeswoman ellen bork said officials refused 
to talk to the group because the matter is in litigation 
the veterans filed a federal lawsuit in laredo texas 
contesting a us customs order barring them from leaving the 
country at laredo unless they posted bond and signed an agreement 
to return the aging fleet of 38 school buses and pickup trucks to 
the united states 
customs seized four of the convoys vehicles in laredo and 
another four had mechanical problems and didnt make the long trip 
from the border to washington the convoy arrived thursday and its 
remaining 30 vehicles circled the white house in protest for a 
couple of hours while the veterans rallied across the street 
the administration contends that to let the vehicles remain in 
nicaragua would violate a trade embargo 
convoy spokesmen said they wanted to meet with elliot abrams 
assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs because 
they believe he played a major role in keeping the convoy from 
leaving the united states 
members of the convoy said they would try to meet with other 
administration officials in washington next week 
the convoy began in four cities seattle missoula mont 
minneapolis and caribou maine and the four groups traveled 
through 100 cities in 42 states before joining up in austin 
arriving in laredo on june 7 
the 30 tons of aid carried by the group includes oats and dry 
milk medicine and medical supplies such as crutches and 
wheelchairs and clothing 
an additional 140 tons of humanitarian aid collected by the 
group was shipped to nicaragua members of the convoy said

morton thiokol engineers have yet to 
take apart a redesigned space shuttle rocket motor testfired last 
week but early analysis indicates it performed as expected a 
spokesman said friday 
the june 14 test was the fourth of five required to qualify the 
redesigned booster for resumption of space shuttle flights grounded 
after the 1986 challenger explosion 
the fifth test is scheduled late july at rocket manufacturer 
morton thiokols plant west of here and the shuttle discovery is 
tentatively scheduled to fly late in the summer 
officials of morton thiokol and the national aeronautics and 
space administration pronounced the test successful at the time 
but said a thorough examination was necessary 
the 126footlong motors joints have been inspected inside and 
out and there was no evidence of damage from superhot gases said 
company spokesman rocky raab 
none of the joints leaked and the inside of the motor looks 
very good he said 
the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 was blamed on a 
booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through 
an oring triggering the blast that killed the seven crew members 
raab said engineers had spent several days calibrating the 
hundreds of channels of instrumentation involved in the testfiring 
to make sure the readings were accurate 
he said the engineers were examining computer results and likely 
would begin taking the motor apart next week

vice president george bush citing michael dukakis support for 
115 million in state tax increases said friday the difference 
between him and the democratic governor was tax cuts versus tax 
hikes dukakis said new jersey sen bill bradley has taken 
himself out of consideration for the vice presidential nomination 
i respect that dukakis told reporters as he began a brief 
vacation 
jesse jackson dismissed a published report he had told aides 
that he would not accept the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket 
whoever was talking was not authorized but also was not 
dealing in the truth said jackson 
the former civil rights leader said thursday he had decided 
whether or not to accept the vice presidential nomination but he 
refused to disclose his decision the boston globe reported friday 
that jackson had told aides he wasnt interested in the vice 
presidency 
jackson denied the report during a visit to puerto rico where he 
picked up six of the states 57 democratic convention delegates 
previously the entire delegation had been committed to support 
dukakis at the july democratic national convention 
talking to reporters at a republican unity meeting in 
cincinnati bush cited dukakis announcement on thursday that he 
supports a 115 million tax package that included a 40 million 
levy on ciagrettes as part of an effort to deal with a 200 million 
state budget shortfall 
i will not raise your taxes period said the vice 
president he just has in his home state 
bush added that im just pointing out a fundamental difference 
that i have on the federal level in terms of what the governor 
himself has said it makes me wonder what his commitment is 
bush told reporters that their views on taxes was a plain as 
day difference between himself and dukakis he said that 
difference was tax cuts versus tax hikes 
the massachusetts tax increases offered a welcome target to 
republicans eager to knock down the lead dukakis has enjoyed in 
recent national polls 
gop senate leader bob dole of kansas was scheuled to address a 
party meeting in ohio on saturday and his office released the 
following excerpt 
george bush has made it clear that he will not raise taxes 
period and what about mike dukakis ask the people of 
massachusetts yesterday they got some more bad news from their 
governor hes at it again he just announced 110 million in new 
taxes for the people of taxachusetts 
the revenue shortfall in massachusetts is common to other states 
as well and is a result in part of the changes in federal tax laws 
enacted in 1986 
bush was asked why he was not equally critical of republican 
ally gov james thompson of illinois who has also proposed a tax 
increase to help balance his state budget 
dukakis is running for president of the united states jim 
thompson is not said bush 
the vice president also said he was confident he would overcome 
the socalled gender gap the indication in polls that women voters 
support dukakis by a far higher percentage than do men 
i am confident we can overcome this gender gap said bush 
i want to be sure im as sensitive as possible to the concerns of 
these activist women in our party i think weve got a good message 
for women 
dukakis said bradley had told the campaign he wasnt interested 
in the vice presidency 
in any event were going to keep in touch said the 
massachusetts governor who was vacationing on nantucket an island 
off the coast of massachusetts 
at his side was his wife kitty who underwent spinal surgery 
three weeks ago 
want to see my scar she said removing the neck brace she 
has worn since the operation 
meanwhile democratic party platform writers worked in colorado 
on what was shaping up as the shortest party platform in half a 
century a document calling for restoration of competence and 
hope and avoiding talk of higher taxes a pentagon spending 
freeze or a palestinian homeland 
those three issues could be the subject of convention fights 
between supporters of dukakis and jackson though jackson partisan 
eleanor holmes norton said im not expecting any battles were 
trying to work out things that could cause great difficulties 
in other political news 
the latest figures from the federal election commission show a 
continuing slump in republican fundraising although the gop still 
leads the democrats 
the fec summary of 15month totals through march 31 showed 
republican committees had raised 97 million compared to 127 
million at the same point in 1986 137 million in 1984 and 116 
million in 1982 the democrats have raised a total of 29 million 
in this cycle compared to 24 million in 1986 37 million in 
1984 and 13 million in 1982 
sen john glenn of ohio got a boost as democratic vice 
presidential nominee from republican party chairman frank j 
fahrenkopf jr at the cincinnati gop meeting fahrenkopf said 
glenns presence on the democratic ticket would make the gops job 
more difficult in november 
he is a national hero the gop chairman said of glenn the 
former astronaut who was the first american to orbit earth 
people take a lot of pride in that and it can transcend party 
affiliations

the senate appropriations committee approved a 
bill friday providing 106 billion for the governments 
transportation programs despite a veto threat from the reagan 
administration 
the measure for fiscal 1989 sent to the full senate on a voice 
vote would also allow spending of up to an additional 144 
billion from the revenues the government collects each year for 
aviation highway and mass transit programs the fiscal year begins 
oct 1 
under the legislation the government would spend 66 billion 
for the federal aviation administration an increase of 800 
million over this year spending for the coast guard would grow 
350 million to 3 billion of which 492 million would be set 
aside for drug interdiction work 
in a continuation of a perennial dispute between the 
administration and the democraticcontrolled congress the 
committee ignored a white house request to slash spending for mass 
transit and eliminate federal aid to amtrak the passenger railroad 
instead the committee would provide 581 million for amtrak and 
32 billion for mass transit 
james c miller iii director of the presidents office of 
management and budget sent letters thursday to committee members 
saying he would urge president reagan to veto the legislation 
miller complained that the measure would allow 23 billion in 
spending more than the president wants he also objected to the 
mass transit and amtrak spending and the inclusion of about 25 
million for local highway projects lawmakers had tucked into the 
bill 
the legislators accepted an amendment on voice vote by sen 
warren rudman rnh aimed at blocking logan international 
airport in boston from imposing higher landing fees on small 
aircraft 
in an effort to reduce congestion for airline passengers by 
encouraging private planes to use suburban airfields logan 
officials have scheduled the higher fees to take effect july 1 
rudmans provision would halt federal aid to the airport unless 
officials agreed to hold off the increases until the department of 
transportation completes an inquiry on the pricing structure and 
until lawsuits seeking to block the higher costs are settled 
the house is scheduled to vote next week on a 109 billion 
version of the spending bill

a grand jury has heard the case of a 
newspaper editor accused of criminally libeling two state 
legislators in an editorial but announced no decision 
williamsburg county court officials said a decision about the 
charges against editor jim fitts will be announced when the next 
session of court begins monday which is the usual procedure 
state rep bj gordon and an attorney for fellow plaintiff 
state sen frank mcgill who is recovering from cancer treatment 
would not comment on their 30minute appearance before the grand 
jury thursday 
gordon did however disagree with civil libertarians who have 
said the states criminal libel law is outdated if its 
outdated then the ten commandments are outdated 
the case has drawn interest because criminal libel laws which 
can send journalists to jail are unusual in the united states 
critics say they can be used to stifle freeflowing political 
debate 
the charge carries a penalty of up to 5000 in fines or a year 
in jail or both 
only four times in 40 years has the law has been used in south 
carolina similar laws exist but are rarely used in 23 other states 
and the district of columbia said jane kirtley executive director 
of the reporters committee for freedom of the press in washington 
dc 
i think that criminal libel laws are a relic of the past 
ms kirtley said it seems to me that punishing people for 
speaking is not an american concept 
fitts was arrested and jailed may 20 on the charge of criminal 
libel after he wrote a column critical of gordon mcgill and their 
reelection bids in the june 14 primaries which both men won 
in his column in the may 17 issue of the voice a blackoriented 
newspaper with a circulation of about 2300 fitts wrote in part 
i will say to you without fear of contradiction if every black 
in williamsburg county would start stealing today and steal every 
day for the rest of their lives they could not steal as much as 
those two have stolen during their time in power 
fitts would not be specific thursday when asked what he thought 
the two men had stolen other than to say he thought they had 
stolen the pride of people in williamsburg county 
and he said the issue was economic not racial fitts and gordon 
are black mcgill is white 
neither gordon nor mcgills attorney kingstree lawyer wallace 
connor would say whether would consider settling out of court 
both said the law was necessary because civil suits are often 
uncollectable because of the defendants inability to pay and as 
long as the law is on the books it should be obeyed they said 
fitts said mcgill and gordon represent the haves in the county 
who oppress the havenots 
its not a racial issue he said im just challenging a 
sytem that has been programmed for years to control the people 
gordons response was to note that hes been elected to office 
for nine consecutive terms 
fitts bond initially was set at 40000 after two days in 
jail he was released may 22 on a personal recognizance bond 
gordon said thursday his intent was not to silence the press 
but to make sure the law was obeyed 
freedom of the press is not to go around with freedom and

the soviet union claims an israeli hotel built 
an access road on sovietowned property in downtown jerusalem and 
is suing it for tresspassing an attorney said friday 
it was the first property suit brought by a soviet consular 
delegation that arrived in israel last summer after a 20 years of 
minimal contact between the two countries the soviet union broke 
diplomatic relations during the 1967 middle east war 
israeli officials say they are willing to negotiate the soviet 
claims and hope the talks will not disrupt what they see as a thaw 
in sovietisraeli relations 
the disputed property is a parking lot near the tirat bat sheva 
hotel on king george street said yacov miron an israeli attorney 
for the soviet delegation 
the area is registered as a soviet government property and we 
demand it back miron told the associated press 
most of the soviet property in israel was bought in the 19th 
century by the russian orthodox church or by governmentaffiliated 
bodies of imperial russia 
last july the soviet union sent the eightmember consular team 
to israel to examine property holdings and renew passports for the 
estimated 2500 soviet passport holders here 
israel has demanded a reciprocal visit by an israeli delegation 
to moscow earlier this month soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze said the israeli delegation would receive visas in 
july 
two weeks ago soviet delegation head georgy martirosov informed 
israels foreign ministry it had completed a survey of soviet 
property being used by israel 
the ministry said the soviets were expected to present demands 
for rental payments 
miron said the parking lot was registered in the name of the 
soviet government in 1949 after israel was created 
the area was first seized by the jerusalem municipality which 
turned it into a municipal parking lot he said then the hotel 
made a access road through it 
according to the israeli news agency itim the hotel is using 
some 200 square yards of the area hotel officials refused comment 
miron said the complaint followed letters sent to the hotel and 
the jerusalem municipality which demanded evacuation of the area 
he said the municipality had not responded 
in the complaint which was filed thursday the soviets demand 
the parking lot be evacuated 
miron said other property claims may follow but did not 
elaborate he declined to say what the soviets intended to do if 
they got the area back 
they just want it back he said

the fortunes of the republican party have been 
in a slump while the democrats still lagging far behind in overall 
dollars inch their way up the fundraising laddder federal 
election commission figures showed friday 
the fec summary of 15month totals for this election cycle 
through march 31 showed the three nationallevel republican 
committees had raised 97 million compared with 127 million at 
the same point in 1986 137 million in 1984 and 116 million in 
1982 
the democrats meanwhile have raised a total of 29 million in 
this cycle compared with 24 million in 1986 37 million in 1984 
and 13 million in 1982 the figures are based on committee reports 
to the fec and do not include socalled soft money that the parties 
raise for nonfederal campaign spending 
kathryn murray communications director of the republican 
national committee acknowledged friday that the rnc hit a rough 
stretch in 1987 but she said the committee already has turned the 
corner to move back into bonanza fundraising days although not 
on a par with the 1984 election cycle when president reagan ran for 
reelection 
were sure democratic national committee chairman paul kirk 
would change checkbooks with us any day she said adding that 
she expects the second quarter of this year to come it at over 10 
million 
while still not as strong as the 15 million during the same 
period in 1984 that will top any other rnc second quarter she 
said 
when broken down by committee the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee and democratic congressional campaign committee 
both have shown steady growth over the years while their 
republican counterparts have lagged 
the reason the overall democratic total is lower in this cycle 
than in the 1984 presidential year is due to the drop in receipts 
to the democratic national committee between 1984 and 1986 
in 1984 the dnc had collected 26 million in the first 15 
months of the cycle in 1986 receipts dropped to less than 11 
million at the same point and this year are back up to nearly 13 
million the fec report shows 
the democrats now are carrying a total debt of 37 million 
compared with less than 1 million for the gop 
dnc spokesman mike mccurry said the democrats are pleased with 
their progress this year even the fec numbers show the 15month 
dnc receipts are only half what they were in 1984 
the party going into this general election cycle is in a 
strong financial position rather than trying to play catch up 
as in past years he said 
the rncs murray said gop hopes have been stirred by the fact 
that the first quarter of 1988 brought in 126 million almost as 
good as the 13 million in 1986 the 17 million raised during the 
same period of 1984 was an aberration that showed reagans 
extraordinary popularity she said 
generally the rnc and dnc have their biggest fundraising 
successes in presidential years while the senatorial and 
congressional committees are active in the offyear congressional 
races 
in total contributions and support of congressional candidates 
the democratic committees spent 12 million as of march 31 
compared with 744186 spent by the republicans 
the disparity was most notable in the war for the us senate 
where the democrats have considerably fewer resources but spent 
more in support of their candidates than the republicans 
for campaign costs paid directly by a national committee rather 
than by a candidates own campaign the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee spent 420173 on its candidates as of march 31 
compared with 2814 spent by its gop counterpart the fec data 
showed 
tom mason spokesman for the national republican senatorial 
committee acknowledged serious fundraising problems over the past 
several months and said the committees ill fortunes were not a 
surprise 
after the 1986 elections when the republicans gave up control 
of the senate by losing nine seats enthusiasm among gop 
contributors waned he said 
he said the presidential campaign also has drained away 
potential donors to senate races 
mason tried to put a good face on the financial picture 
however saying that while gross intake is down the net money 
available to help candidates has improved in recent years because 
the nrsc has taken a sharper pencil to the cost of fundraising

a plan by sen john warner rva to close 
roads through the manassas national battlefield park was killed by 
a senate panel friday but warner vowed to revive the plan in talks 
with house members 
im going to do my best to try and go forward with planning 
roads warner said after the senate appropriations committee 
rejected his request for 28 million to study ways to cut off two 
heavily traveled roads that run through the historic civil war 
battlefield 
warners compromise plan which is similar to a previous 
interior department proposal is part of a federal effort to reduce 
the impact of a proposed 12 million square foot shopping center on 
the nearby national park 
warner does not oppose the commercial complex but believes that 
closing roads within the park would lessen the developments impact 
on the battleground 
historians and preservationists argue that the complex which 
also would include 17 million square feet of office space and 560 
homes would forever violate the sanctity of the stillrustic 
battlefield 
three measures now under consideration in the house would either 
authorize the federal government to purchase the land or scuttle 
the shopping center plan by preventing federal highway money from 
being used for roads to and from the development 
before warners plan can again be considered an amendment that 
would prevent federal money from being used for highway 
construction associated with the development must be dropped from a 
house appropriations bill 
congressional rules stipulate that if that amendment offered by 
rep robert mrazek dny warners amendment could then be 
reconsidered in future talks between house and senate conferees 
mrazek is not likely to drop his amendment at least until the 
outcome of the landpurchase bills is clear said tad boggs a 
spokesman for the congressman 
plans to purchase the property offered by rep frank wolf 
rva and a similar measure by mrazek and rep michael andrews 
dtexas would also close two roads running through the park and 
build new roads around it 
buying the 542acre development site and adding it to the 
4600acre battlefield park is not an option at least in the 
senate warner said 
the mall site is currently valued at 135 million but the 
ultimate selling price would likely be three times higher a 
figure approaching the federal governments annual appropriation 
for park purchases

jesse jackson denied friday that he 
told aides he would reject the democratic vice presidential 
nomination and said he wanted the party platform to discuss 
palestinians and puerto ricans 
jackson who said thursday he had made his decision on the vice 
presidency but would keep it private unless michael dukakis offers 
him the job was asked about a report quoting unnamed aides as 
saying he would turn down the post 
no absolutely not therefore whoever was talking was not 
authorized but also was not dealing in the truth jackson said 
the matter of the vice presidency is a serious matter the 
destiny of our nation perhaps the rest of the world rests on the 
campaign in july and in november to that extent there will be no 
intrigue about that decision jackson told reporters 
he and dukakis agreed in a california meeting tuesday that only 
the two of them and a top adviser to each ron brown for jackson 
and paul brountas for dukakis would discuss the vice presidential 
question 
jackson said he will make his decision known at an appropriate 
time 
jackson breakfasted with his local campaign committee and 
dressed in a white latinstyle shirt and blue jeans danced to 
africanrooted puerto rican folk music at a rally for a fishermans 
association in santurce a sector of san juan founded 215 years ago 
by freed slaves 
before a scheduled speech to the puerto rico chamber of 
commerce jackson planned to huddle again with gov rafael 
hernandez colon and senate president miguel hernandez agosto the 
governor agreed thursday to seek support for jackson from at least 
six of the islands 57 delegates 
jackson had complained about receiving no delegates despite 
winning puerto ricos march 20 primary 
jackson said it was too early to assess the draft platform being 
worked out in denver jackson said hell continue to push for a 
freeze on the defense budget and for increasing taxes on the 
wealthy two items excluded from the preliminary platform 
clearly the defense scam is evidence we can freeze the 
military budget without freezing our defense jackson said 
saying 60 billion could be saved by 1993 by freezing the 
corruption and the cost overruns and ending singlesource 
contracts 
the money for needed social programs such as expansion of 
health care and education should come from the wealthy he said 
the people who did not benefit from the reagan years of 
prosperity must not have the burden jackson said 
he also said he wanted a platform plank on palestinians a 
subject that makes some democrats nervous because they fear it 
could alienate loyal jewish voters 
the language is being addressed now the concept is very 
clear jackson said we stand for security for israel with 
secure borders security for israel justice or homeland for 
palestinians and peace for both we stand for the principle of 
mutual recognition and mutual security 
he also said he supports puerto rican selfdetermination he 
said puerto ricans should choose their own form of government 
with no interference and without intimidation 
he has indicated he supports a transfer of powers from the 
united states prior to a puerto rican vote on political status the 
governing party supports commowealth status established in 1952 
but wants greater local power 
some believe ending legal ties to the united states before 
voting on status would virtually rule out statehood expected 
republican nominee george bush supports puerto rico statehood 
the 32 million puerto ricans are us citizens who are largely 
selfgoverning but subject to federal laws they do not vote in 
national elections and their delegate to congress has no vote

william m kuntsler and other lawyers 
defending six members of a leftwing group charged with setting off 
a bomb in the us capitol derided the prosecution friday as a 
political effort to silence dissent 
prosecutors want to teach a lesson to all dissidents that 
the penalties are very high if you commit crimes against the 
government kuntsler said after he appeared with the defendants 
and their lawyers before us district judge harold greene 
asked about greenes reputation as a fair judge kuntsler said 
his actions belie it hes a product of the system 
a fair trial is impossible anyway for anyone like them we can 
only do the best we can do said kuntsler who represents 
defendant laura whitehorn 
earlier kuntsler was asked about greenes reputation as a 
liberal judge to which he replied to me a liberal means 
neofascist 
during the hearing greene denied a motion to remove a clear 
plastic wall between the spectators and the court that the defense 
claims is intended to intimidate the defendants and prejudice 
jurors once the case goes to trial 
these women and men were accused by the government to in 
essence criminalize their political beliefs said defense lawyer 
russell f canan 
by installing the shield and tv cameras the government is 
using the courtroom as simply just another tool for political 
surveillance canan said 
the strident political rhetoric by defense lawyers signaled 
their intention to turn the proceeding into a trial of the politics 
of the reagan administration rather than the charges that the 
defendants set off bombs in the capitol and three other locations 
in washington 
we are not terrorists nor criminals we are antiimperialist 
political prisoners and we are guilty of no crimes said the 
statement by defendants marilyn buck linda sue evans susan 
rosenberg alan berkman timothy blunk and whitehorn 
the politically motivated indictment against us is part of a 
program of repression against the most active elements in the 
central american solidarity movement that has grown among the 
people of the us over the past years the statement said we 
will fight these charges but we will not allow ourselves to be part 
of a governmental show trial 
the six plus fugitive elizabeth duke are charged with setting 
off a bomb that blew a large hole in a wall outside the us senate 
chamber on nov 7 1983 they also are accused of detonating bombs 
at three washington military facilities in 1983 and 1984 
buck evans and whitehorn also are charged with leading a 
campaign of armed propaganda against imperialist rule by a 
secret leftwing group that set off bombs in four locations in new 
york city between 1983 and 1985 
the other defendants are named but not charged as participants 
in the alleged conspiracy to oppose obstruct or change the 
foreign and domestic policies of the us government through 
violent and illegal means 
none of the blasts caused any injuries 
but after the capitol bombing a group calling itself the armed 
resistance unit issued a communique to national public radio 
threatening possible future violence against individual members 
of the ruling class and government 
we do not choose to kill any of them at this time but their 
lives are not sacred the communique said 
rosenberg and blunk are serving 58year sentences for possession 
of 600 pounds of ammunition and explosives evans is serving terms 
totaling 45 years for illegal weapons charges 
buck who was not in court friday is awaiting sentencing in new 
york for murder and armed robbery in connection with a botched 1981 
holdup of a brinks armored car that left a guard and two policemen 
dead

south africa and angola ended a day of 
usmediated peace talks friday still widely separated with 
neither side indicating it was willing to back down on positions 
unacceptable to the other sources said 
south africa is insisting on the withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola as a precondition for independence for southwest africa 
also known as namibia angola is demanding an end to south african 
military and logistical aid to angolan rebels 
the talks are aimed at bringing peace to angola where civil war 
has raged for 13 years and to bring independence to namibia which 
is controlled by south africa 
after a twohour formal opening session delegations dispersed 
to discuss proposals put forward by south africa and the joint 
angolancuban group sources close to the conference said 
further formal talks were scheduled for saturday morning the 
second and final day of this third round of negotiations that began 
in london last month 
the talks went pretty roughly a cuban source said 
reports in the south african press said south africas foreign 
minister rf botha angrily led his delegation out of the 
conference hall south african cuban angolan and american 
delegates denied it 
the talks are taking place at three tables with chester 
crocker assistant us secretary of state for african affairs 
sitting at the head table as mediator 
delegates refused to talk officially on the substance of 
proposals presented friday confirming only that the formal talks 
would resume saturday 
but sources close to the conference who insisted on anonymity 
said botha insisted that as a precondition for namibian 
independence cuba announce a date by which it would withdraw its 
more than 50000 troops from angola 
the sources said the angolan delegation headed by foreign 
minister afonso van dunem demanded that south africa halt its aid 
to angolan rebels 
the sources also said that should a fourth round of talks be 
needed angola and cuba would insist that they be held in new york 
the first two rounds of talks were in may in london and 
brazzaville congo 
in new york on friday a senior angolan official pedro 
vandunem minister of state for petroleum and economy asserted 
that the united states had introduced a new double linkage in 
its negotiating position 
he told reporters that in a meeting wednesday with angolan 
representatives secretary of state george p shultz not only 
reiterated a us call for a cuban withdrawal from angola but also 
pressed the angolans to negotiate with the angolan rebel group the 
national union for the total independence of angola or unita 
which has us support 
vandunem said such negotiations are out of the question 
asked about vandunems statement a state department official 
in washington said it has long been the us view that direct 
discussions between the angolan government and the unita forces are 
needed for a settlement 
its not a condition that we are laying down its just a 
fact given the reality of the situation on the ground said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity

the democratic attorney general of massachusetts 
said friday he believes that reports of an fbi probe of a state 
prison project were probably a leak from the reagan 
administration whose own top legal officer blasted leaks and 
warned associates to keep quiet 
state attorney general james shannon said he believes the fbi 
investigation was leaked for political purposes in washington 
the reporter who first revealed the fbi probe said shannon was 
wrong 
attorney general edwin meese iii meanwhile addressed the issue 
of news leaks involving democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis at a friday meeting of top justice department managers 
spokesman patrick korten said meese reminded his deputies there is 
to be no leaking of information about any current 
investigations 
meese described any leaking as highly unprofessional conduct 
and extremely injurious and extremely unfair according to korten 
on thursday the washington times cited law enforcement 
authorities and others and said the fbi was conducting a 
preliminary inquiry into the conduct of dukakis and 
highranking members of his administration in connection with the 
1986 selection of a multimillion prison site in central 
massachusetts 
the fbi confirmed the probe but said dukakis was not a 
subject of the investigation 
i dont know who did it shannon told reporters at a news 
conference on civil rights but when you see what is clearly a 
leak from federal law enforcement authorities there are clearly 
conclusions youre likely to jump to that it was a leak from the 
reagan administration 
shannon supports dukakis campaign for the democratic 
presidential nomination but holds office independently of the 
governor and is not part of the dukakis administration 
jerry seper who wrote the piece said of shannons remarks 
thats just absolutely false no one from the reagan 
administration the justice department and no one from the fbi 
leaked this story to the washington times 
the story resulted from asking questions in massachusetts of a 
lot of people over several weeks 
shannon said he called the fbi office in boston after reading a 
version of the times story 
they made perfectly clear to me that its the most preliminary 
of inquiries shannon said he praised james ahearn the special 
agent in charge of the boston office for issuing the statement 
clarifying that dukakis was not a subject of the fbis inquiry 
the case centers on a proposed prison that has met with vigorous 
opposition in the community of new braintree opponents charge that 
the property owners one of whom is an acquaintance of dukakis 
and a donor to his political campaigns stand to make millions of 
dollars in profit from the sale 
fbi officials have had no comment since releasing a carefully 
worded statement that said the boston field office is conducting an 
inquiry into the proposed land deal and noting later in elaboration 
that it is too soon in the inquiry for anyone to be called a 
subject 
shannon said he has long been aware of complaints about the 
siting process at new braintree and that he has referred all 
charges of impropriety to the state inspector general 
i assume that what the fbi is doing is the same thing you 
get an allegation and you have to ask some questions shannon 
said we felt that because allegations had been made the proper 
way was to have the inspector general take a look 
if the inspector general found grounds for a criminal 
investigation he would refer the matter back to the attorney 
generals office shannon said and that has not happened

australian prime minister bob hawke flew to 
texas friday after warning top officials here that current american 
farm support policies could produce a backlash in his country 
damaging to usaustralian military cooperation 
during a twoday washington visit hawke gave that message to a 
meeting of both houses of congress to president reagan at the 
white house and to the two leading candidates to succeed reagan 
republican vice president george bush and democratic gov michael 
dukakis of massachusetts 
he said he believes that bush like reagan backs ending the 
farm supports and he would be disappointed if dukakis doesnt also 
the australian leader was scheduled to speak at the university 
of texas in austin before returning home 
hawke spent his last half day in washington golfing with 
secretary of state george p shultz on the fashionable burning tree 
course and meeting an array of us economic and business officials 
at an australian embassy lunch 
the guests included agriculture secretary richard lyng 
securities and exchange commission chairman david s ruder 
chairman beryl w sprinkel of reagans council of economic 
advisers deputy secretary of state john whitehead and washington 
post chairman katherine graham the embassy said 
between meetings with bush and dukakis late thursday hawke 
asked americans to recognize that the australian military bases and 
satellite tracking stations shared with us forces have an 
important role in the vital verification process of ussoviet 
nuclear disarmament including the treaty under negotiation to 
reduce strategic longrange arms by 50 percent 
the prime minister told a television interviewer he rejects 
linking the future of the bases to us farm subsidies damaging the 
australian economy but that realistically australian public 
opinion would link them 
im simply saying honestly and objectively that if there 
were to be an increase in this adverse impact upon our farmers who 
are unsubsidized and the most efficient in the world there will be 
a growth of resentment of the united states hawke said on the 
macneillehrer tv newshour 
he added it would be wrong to close down those facilities 
military bases but politicians in the end cant resist the 
will of the people 
the impact of subsidized us wheat exports has been 
considerable hawke said declaring that the share of the world 
wheat market for unsubsidized australian wheat dropped from 20 to 
12 percent during the three years of the us wheat export subsidy 
program while the us share rose from 29 to 43 percent 
bush understands and i think supports my position said 
hawke i would be disappointed if dukakis didnt adopt the same 
position he added in the interview which took place before his 
talk with dukakis

leslie manigat the 
deposed president of haiti knew when he fired lt gen henri 
namphy as military commander that the general would retaliate 
manigats wife said friday 
myrlande manigat said several ranking army officers advised her 
husband to put namphy in jail but the president decided instead to 
confine him to house arrest without a telephone or other means of 
communication 
manigat knew namphy would take action but not in that 
manner she said in a televised interview referring to the 
palace guards who freed namphy on sunday and put him back in the 
national palace 
manigat who arrived in the dominican republic with his family 
the day after the coup and flew to miami on friday has said he was 
ousted because he tried to end corruption in the army and the 
government 
the confrontation with gen namphy was inevitable sooner or 
later because he and my husband had nothing in common morally in 
terms of humaneness intellectually in their values in nothing 
mrs manigat said 
namphy led the junta that ruled haiti for two years after 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled in february 1986 he turned over 
power to manigat on feb 7 after manigat won a presidential 
election with the armys help and proclaimed himself presidend 
monday after the coup 
the night of the coup many ambassadors called manigat and told 
him to hide mrs manigat said two ambassadors offered refuge in 
their embassies but he refused to leave and said they had to come 
arrest him she said without elaborating 
after seing namphy on television announcing the takeover with 
all the ranking officers at his side manigat told his family 
you have to prepare for anything all is lost we cant count 
on the armed forces to overcome a military coup she said 
when soldiers arrived with tanks and began shooting at the 
manigat house she said the 20 people inside prepared to fight but 
manigat told them to surrender because you cant resist a tank 
with a rifle 
the group shouted their surrender and went outside 
they put us in line and started shooting again and i thought 
they were going to kill us all but they didnt mrs manigat 
said i think it was a psychological action to make us think they 
were going to 
the manigats and their daughter were taken to the airport and 
flew to the dominican republic around midday 
when i found myself in the hotel in santo domingo when we 
were alone i simply started to cry without being able to control 
myself mrs manigat said it was a kind of relief to be 
safe to be in a friendly place and to no longer be alone

canada doesnt have spy scandals very often but 
it suddenly finds itself embroiled in an espionage drama involving 
sophisticated us naval technology the banishment of 19 soviets 
and reprisals from moscow 
yet nobody was supposed to know about it 
as the canadian embassy in moscow awaited the kremlins next 
move friday officials here remained silent on exactly what the 
soviets they expelled were trying to do 
in the latest retaliation by the kremlin the soviet government 
newspaper izvestia on friday accused three canadians diplomats who 
have been expelled or barred from the soviet union of specific acts 
of espionage izvestia said one of them had collaborated with us 
diplomats who were also ejected as spies 
according to intelligence sources the soviet spy ring was 
trying to infiltrate the paramax electronics plant in montreal 
where weapons guidance communications and sonar systems for a new 
generation of canadian frigates are being supplied under a 830 
million contract 
paramax is a subsidiary of the detroitbased unisys corp a 
major defense contractor with access to highly classified 
electronic warfare technology already in use in the us navy 
another target was the us naval base at argentia 
newfoundland where 400 members of the naval security command 
monitor the movement of soviet submarines the sources said 
there was also an attempt to penetrate the royal canadian 
mounted police intelligence service and its successor the canadian 
security intelligence service according to foreign minister joe 
clark he refused to detail other alleged soviet transgressions 
in a statement to parliament wednesday clark announced eight 
soviets had been expelled and nine others formerly assigned here 
were barred from returning 
we are confident that canadian security was not compromised 
clark said 
the soviets retaliated immediately expelling two canadian 
diplomats and barring three others from returning to the soviet 
union 
clark proclaiming the innocence of his envoys then escalated 
the incident by expelling the senior military attache at the soviet 
embassy in ottawa col grigori roublev and barring a former 
second secretary from returning 
paul frazer a spokesman for clark said he was aware of the 
accusations in izvestia but had no comment 
the canadian press news agency quoted izvestia as saying ken 
moodie former assistant air attache at the canadian embassy in 
moscow was caught redhanded posing as a tourist at a military 
installation in the siberian city of novosibirsk 
izvestia also named john digangi a former second secretary in 
moscow and cmdr ray steele a naval attache who was scheduled to 
leave moscow today canadian press said in its report izvestia 
said digangi carried out instructions given by three us diplomats 
who were expelled for spying but did not elaborate the news 
agency reported 
canadian officials rejected the charges the news agency said 
intelligence service spokesman jerry cummings and government 
officials told the associated press the spy story was never 
supposed to get out 
it became known because a frenchlanguage reporter in ottawa 
normand lester of radiocanada got a tip from an intelligence 
source that there was a mass exodus of soviet diplomats last week 
with children suddenly withdrawn from schools and apartments 
emptied overnight 
lester knocked on doors to confirm the exodus and broke the 
story tuesday as prime minister brian mulroney was hosting the 
sevennation economic summit in toronto 
at his summitclosing news conference mulroney confirmed that a 
group of soviet representatives had been kicked out for spying but 
gave no details 
according to informed sources the saga began june 11 when a 
25yearold canadian of hungarian descent stephen joseph ratkai 
was arrested in newfoundland and charged with obtaining classified 
us military documents intended for the soviet union 
the sources said capt boris tatarintsev assistant naval 
attache at the soviet embassy in ottawa left the country 
immediately after ratkais arrest 
tatarintsev was one of the original eight diplomats on the 
expulsion list made public wednesday 
government officials would not confirm tatarintsevs involvement 
in the us naval base case but the sources said authorities 
suspected him of working for the gru the soviet military 
intelligence agency and of having overall responsibility for both 
the argentia and paramax operations 
the soviet embassy refused to return calls from the ap to answer 
questions about tatarintsev but embassy spokesman viatcheslav 
bogdanov earlier claimed none of the soviets named were spies 
sources said canadian authorities worked a double agent at 
argentia to prevent soviet infiltration clark said a russian 
translator at the international civil aviation organization in 
montreal provided information on some of the spying operations the 
translator yuri smurov has now defected with his wife and 
daughter 
canada had military and commercial reasons for wanting to keep 
the expulsions secret 
its navy is seeking us approval for the transfer of nuclear 
propulsion technology incorporated in the british trafalgarclass 
submarines it may buy lax security could make the americans veto 
the transfer 
in addition a public rift between the soviet union and canada 
might endanger soviet purchases of canadian wheat and potential 
pipeline and dam projects for canadian engineering firms

republican george bush attacked democrat 
michael dukakis on friday for increasing taxes in massachusetts and 
said i will not raise your taxes period he just has in his 
home state 
the vice president indicated he would go even further than 
president reagan in ruling out all forms of new taxes including 
excise taxes 
bush repeated his criticism of dukakis tax increase at a gop 
unity rally telling applauding republicans i promise you ill 
not raise taxes as a first second or last resort we dont 
need more taxes we need a president who can hold the line against 
congressional overspending 
bush told a news conference the massachusetts governor refuses 
to rule out a tax hike for the nation we know what that means 
bush said that differences between him and dukakis were 
brought into high relief by the announcement yesterday by the 
governor of massachusetts of a 115 million tax hike for his 
state 
dukakis on thursday announced he would sign a package designed 
to close an estimated 200 million state budget shortfall 
including a new 40 million tax on cigarettes 
im just pointing out a fundamental difference that i have on 
the federal level in terms of what the governor himself has said 
it makes me wonder what his commitment is bush said 
in his dukakis announcement he said this represented a 
sharp contrast with the policies of the administration i couldnt 
agree more bush said 
asked whether he would rule out all forms of tax increases even 
excise taxes bush said he would although he would not extend 
that pledge to user fees like those charged for entering 
national parks 
bushs vow went further than the tax opposition voiced 
repeatedly by president reagan 
the administration has supported about 200 billion in tax 
increases during the past seven and a half years including excise 
taxes and a tax hike reagan agreed to last winter as part of a 
budget deficitreduction compromise with congress 
asked if he was concerned his stand would lock him in if 
elected bush said he was not i think its reassuring to the 
working men and women in this country 
bush said he had a plain as day difference with dukakis 
tax cuts vs tax hikes 
bush was asked why he was criticizing dukakis for a tax increase 
in his state when the week before during a campaign swing through 
illinois he declined to criticize gop illinois gov james thompson 
for supporting a taxincrease package 
dukakis is running for president of the united states jim 
thompson is not bush said 
new hampshire gov john sununu who traveled to cincinnati with 
bush told reporters on air force two that i dont know why 
anybodys surprised that dukakis signed a tax increase 
everytime hes had a problem hes run to a tax increase he 
said 
bush was here for a unity rally and a series of republican 
meetings including a session with republican women 
sitting beside sen nancy kassebaum rkan and maureen reagan 
the presidents daughter bush said the gender gap problem dogging 
his campaign would close once he begins to speak out more on issues 
we want to emphasize the strength of family bush said in a 
portion of the meeting open to reporters i think this gap will 
go away 
recent polls have shown that women voters prefer dukakis over 
bush by 20 or more points 
bush told reporters i think weve got a good message for 
women and i want to do a better job of getting that message out of 
family and caring and equal opportunity and peace and jobs 
at the same time bush said he remains against the equal rights 
amendment but for womens rights 
bush said he would soon unveil a child care program that would 
be a major part of his campaign platform 
republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf meanwhile said 
reagan is eager to stump for bush but fahrenkopf said bushs 
current problem in the polls partly stems from the fact that he is 
the vice president 
being a vice president and running for the presidency is a 
difficult position to be in the party chief said 
on the subject of a vice presidential choice bush said he had 
assigned campaign aide bob teeter his chief pollster to develop a 
process for coming up with a list of potential names 
however he said he still had not begun considering specific 
choices 
as he has been doing at nearly every stop during the past week 
bush took another jab at the massachusetts prison furlough program 
under which some convicts were released on weekend passes 
although the program was modified earlier this year to stop 
furloughs for firstdegree murderers bush said the dukakis 
furlough program still applies to convicted drug dealers giving 
them a chance to maintain their contacts in the criminal world and 
peddle their illicit wares 
two vanquished gop rivals sen bob dole of kansas and christian 
broadcaster pat robertson praised bush at the rally 
the republican party is united and we are not about to see the 
country go for a mediocre liberal like michael dukakis robertson 
said 
quipped dole id accept the nomination but its already 
gone 
bush also met with dole and a group of local farmers to discuss 
the drought afflicting most of the nations central farm belt 
we should be prepared if conditions continue to deteriorate 
to provide more disaster relief as needed bush said in a 
statement after the meeting these programs should be funded from 
savings from the reduced cost of this years farm programs

fire rekindled in a gasoline storage 
tank friday just hours after officials declared it extinguished 
and 10000 evacuated residents of the area started going home 
flames and thick black smoke shot into the air over this 
industrial suburb of monterrey for a second day radio and 
television stations warned people to stay away from the san rafael 
gasoline depot where three 40foottall tanks exploded thursday 
killing at least four people and injuring at least 18 
it was the second explosion and fire in a month at a depot 
operated by pemex the government oil monopoly on may 24 more 
than 100000 people were forced out of the area around a gas and 
kerosene supply depot in the northern city of chihuahua no one was 
hurt 
news reports in monterrey said the death toll at san rafael 
might be higher the daily el sol said one of its reporters saw 
seven badly burned bodies at a local morgue and ran a banner 
headline saying theyre hiding deaths 
officials declared two of the blazing tanks extinguished late 
thursday night they reported the third one out friday morning but 
then said the collapsed tank began burning again a few hours later 
a pemex statement friday afternoon said two people were killed 
thursday and two of the injured died friday it said firefighters 
had the new blaze under control and it was expected to burn out 
within hours 
one of the dead was vicente quiroga garcia ownermanager of the 
monterrey construction company constructora quiroga y villarreal 
which pemex hired to maintain fireprevention equipment at the 
depot maria estella garcia a construction company secretary said 
by telephone friday 
the construction company gave the monterrey newspaper el norte a 
list of the names of the 54 workers who were at the plant thursday 
and noted that 13 had not been accounted for 
some of the 13 missing may have died because weve been told 
there are people they havent been able to identify because they 
are so badly burned ms garcia said she said she did not know 
whether that information was from pemex or state health officials 
raul robles assistant commercial director of pemex blamed the 
explosions and fire on a leak in one of the tanks officials said 
each of the 23 tanks at the depot holds 22 million gallons of 
gasoline or diesel fuel 
thousands of people who fled on thursday had begun heading home 
many searching for relatives lost in the rush to escape a fire that

the largest solar flare in four years 
exploded from the sun friday spurring warnings that a major 
magnetic storm probably will disrupt global communications and 
satellite operations on monday 
ive got a major storm warning out for monday and it likely 
will ebb into a minor magnetic storm tuesday said chris balch 
duty forecaster at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations space environment laboratory in boulder colo 
the flare an explosive release of hot gas electrically charged 
particles and xrays poses no direct threat to life on earth but 
the magnetic storm could disrupt such ordinary matters as 
longdistance phone calls and electric power transmission 
proton radiation associated with the solar flare should reach 
orbiting spacecraft saturday said gary heckman noaas chief of 
space environment services he said it should pose no danger to 
soviet cosmonauts orbiting earth as long as they stay inside their 
mir space station 
the magnetic storm is expected to push earths auroras away from 
the poles making the northern lights visible as far south as the 
great lakes boston and england in the northern hemisphere he said 
during a telephone interview 
xrays from the flare probably disrupted communications briefly 
friday although there were no immediate reports he added 
while officials cant forecast the magnetic storm with 
certainty balch said there is a really high probability it 
will start monday as hot gases and charged particles emitted by the 
flare hit earths magnetic field 
the flare began at 944 am pdt friday and lasted nearly two 
hours balch said a smaller flare at 901 am pdt lasted 41 
minutes 
communications likely to be disrupted are shortwave including 
international broadcasts shiptoshore communications polar 
communications and contact between airliners and ground 
controllers heckman said during a phone interview a noaa 
statement said longdistance phone calls also might be affected 
the magnetic storm also will cause errors in the orbits of 
some satellites he said it will slow them down in orbit some 
people will have trouble operating their satellites 
it also could induce stray voltages in electrical power 
transmission systems causing temporary outages and making lights 
flicker he added 
heckman said the magnetic storm warning was issued to the 
national aeronautics and space administration the defense 
department the federal aviation administration and other agencies 
dale gary a solar astronomer at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena said the flare was the biggest since april 
1984 and its visible portion extended perhaps 200000 miles above 
the suns surface he said it came from a group of about 20 
sunspots some up to three times larger than earth 
heckman said the initial burst of xrays and expected magnetic 
storm disrupt communications by altering the shape of earths 
ionosphere a layer of electrically charged particles 100 to 500 
miles above the planets surface 
particles emitted by the flare disrupt satellites both by 
hitting their electronics and by producing drag that slows their 
speed 
the last barnburner magnetic storm occurred in for two days 
in august 1972 although the one expected monday shouldnt be that 
large heckman said 
the current 11year sunspot cycle was expected to peak in 1991 
but scientists said months ago that it seemed to be rising much 
faster than previous cycles and may peak by 1989 
gary said solar flares occur when the magnetic configuration 
of sunspots gets complicated and twisted then they release stored 
energy 
electrically charged particles and gases from the sun flow 
toward earths poles along magnetic field lines to cause the 
northern and southern lights or auroras 
the northern lights normally visible over northern alaska and 
hudson bay are pushed farther south during magnetic storms because 
the earths magnetic field is altered as it is hit by particles and 
gases from solar flares 
heckman said the impending storm should make the auroras visible 
as far south as 50 degrees north latitude and as far north as 50 
degrees south latitude

pope john paul ii on friday condemned 
nazism on the site where 110000 world war ii prisoners died but 
the pontiff angered austrias chief rabbi by not making a specific 
reference to jewish victims 
earlier john paul urged austrian jewish leaders to accept the 
vaticans call for a palestinian homeland the roman catholic 
leader did not respond to appeals for the vatican to give full 
diplomatic recognition to israel 
the pope also said mass in trausdorf near the hungarian border 
for an estimated 80000 people most of them yugoslavs and 
hungarians 
the emotional high point of the day came at mauthausen 
austrias most infamous death camp where an estimated 110000 nazi 
prisoners died or were murdered 
on his arrival six us jews who were opposed to the pontiffs 
meeting thursday with president kurt waldheim scuffled briefly with 
police outside the camp the group was kept away from the pope and 
it was not known if he saw the altercation 
they threw me down they used excessive force rabbi avi 
weiss of riverdale ny told the associated press 
earlier in vienna police detained nazi hunter beate klarsfeld 
and eight supporters 
ludwig soswinski the head of the camp survivors group 
introduced the pope to 11 camp survivors including a polish 
priest rev zdislaw lipinski 
the polishborn pontiff speaking outside a memorial chapel 
said here in mauthausen were people who in the name of a 
lunatic ideology set into motion a whole machinery of contempt and 
hatred of others 
delivering his remarks in german the pontiff continued they 
tortured them broke their bones cruelly abused their bodies and 
their souls 
camp inmates were forced to work in nearby quarries carrying 
huge granite blocks up 189 steps known as the stairway of death 
the pontiff mentioned marcel callo a catholic activist who died 
in mauthausen polish priest st maximilian kolbe and two other 
catholics who died in nazi camps but the roman catholic leader 
made no reference specifically to jews 
that angered chaim eisenberg austrias chief rabbi who told 
reporters in vienna a visit to mauthausen without mentioning the 
word jews once is not satisfactory 
the only jew he mentions who suffered is jesus christ and he 
didnt die in mauthausen eisenberg said 
during the visit john paul stood silently for nearly a minute 
in front of a plaque written in hebrew and german in memory of the 
jewish victims of mauthausen 
the vatican citing austrian researchers says that of the 
44000 poles killed in mauthausen 7000 were jewish while a 
majority of the 32000 hungarians who lost their lives there were 
jewish tens of thousands of soviets and germans also perished 
although the vatican provided no breakdown on the percentage of 
jews 
the pontiff met earlier with austrian jewish community president 
paul grosz and five other jewish leaders in vienna 
the klarsfeld group was outside the building voicing its 
opposition to the pontiffs meeting with waldheim who has faced 
allegations of complicity in nazi war crimes 
mrs klarsfeld and seven supporters were released within several 
hours but her son arno was detained for further questioning 
during the protest he had been wearing a nazi uniform which is 
illegal 
the jewish people have the right to a homeland as any other 
nation has according to international law john paul said the 
same goes for the palestinian people many of whom have become 
homeless and refugees 
the pope reminded his audience he had made a similar call in 
september in miami 
grosz appealed to the pope to work with jewish leaders to seek 
a way to solve the problem of the middle east together 
grosz also said he regretted that full diplomatic relations 
between israel and the holy see have not yet been established 
the pontiff did not respond to that point 
the vatican has cited israels lack of settled borders and the 
international dispute over jerusalem for the absence of diplomatic 
ties with israel 
speaking of the nazi murder of an estimated 6 million jews the 
pope said the incomprehensible pain suffering and tears still 
are before my eyes and etched deep in my soul 
but he added it would be clearly unjust and untrue to charge 
christianity with these unspeakable crimes 
some jewish leaders have accused christians and the vatican in 
particular of failing to do enough to prevent the holocaust 
many jews have criticized the pope for meeting with waldheim at 
the start of the fiveday trip 
waldheim has faced allegations of complicity in nazi war crimes 
during his service in the german army the austrian president has 
denied any wrongdoing

a democratic panel on friday unanimously approved 
a preliminary draft platform that promises to restore competence 
caring and incorruptibility to washington but avoids any talk of 
higher taxes a freeze on pentagon spending or a palestinian 
homeland 
the 16member drafting committee finished work without resolving 
the differences that still divide the michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson campaigns 
but the campaign staffs said they would keep negotiating through 
the night before the full 186member platform committee begins work 
saturday on the document which was shaping up as the democrats 
shortest platform in half a century 
rep william h gray iii of pennsylvania heading the drafting 
effort said i think we have a document that is succinct that 
is clear and a document that will be readable he predicted the 
same spirit of collegiality and cooperation would prevail in the 
platform committee 
before adjourning the panel agreed to a motion by dukakis 
representative michael barnes to strike a vaguely worded paragraph 
that said we believe that executivelegislative cooperation 
instead of confrontation can halt the debacle of deficit and debt 
and more nearly match our revenue base with urgent national 
needs 
barnes said he hoped to offer more substantive language on the 
deficit saturday 
were going to be working hard through the night on a number 
of issues barnes told reporters but he said it was likely some 
issues would not be resolved 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons platform chief said while 
we havent erased the differences we have come closer 
together 
grays panel began the day with a 3500word draft based on 
agreements reached on a host of issues two weeks ago in michigan 
it made numerous revisions which were being incorporated in the 
document overnight 
the panel added a provision sought by rep charles rangel 
dny opposing legalization of illicit drugs 
the document also endorses giving pension funds financial 
incentives to invest in housing construction a variant of a 
jackson campaign proposal 
jackson still in the running although dukakis is virtually 
certain to become the presidential nominee has said previously he 
may take his fight over such issues as higher taxes on the rich and 
a pentagon freeze to the floor of next months democratic 
convention in atlanta 
but norton said there are no nonnegotiable demands from the 
jackson campaign 
dukakis has not ruled out the possibility of higher taxes if he 
is elected but he has refused to allow any discussion of higher 
taxes in the platform 
dukakis has also rejected any mention of a palestinian homeland 
the fact that we may not get the words palestinian state 
does not mean that there are not ways to show greater recognition 
of the rights of palestinians norton said 
the full platform committee will try to put the document in 
final form by sunday 
the preliminary draft incorporated language on a dozen issues 
that dukakis and jackson representatives agreed to two weeks ago on 
mackinac island mich 
but in every significant area of dispute dukakis preferences 
not jacksons were embodied in the preliminary draft 
ted sorensen a john f kennedy speechwriter who penned an 
earlier platform discussion paper for democratic party chairman 
paul g kirk jr said in an interview friday i am the drafter 
of the present draft as well 
its fairly clear now this will be the shortest platform in 
over a hundred years said sorensen it will be a thematic 
readable platform it will not have the traditional negative cast 
reagan republican bush those words arent even mentioned 
said sorensen 
sorensen apparently overstated the case the shortest platform 
in recent history was franklin d roosevelts platform in 1932 
which was under 2000 words 
in contrast the 1984 platform ran to 58 pages and more than 
40000 words 
the draft is headed the restoration of competence and hope 
it pledges party leaders and elected officials to restore 
competence caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive 
branch and get it working again fairly for all americans 
it calls for more stable defense budgets appointment of a 
drug czar and maintaining the special relationship with israel 
while pursuing peace in the middle east along the lines laid out in 
the camp david accords 
it endorses freedom of reproductive choice without 
mentioning abortion it calls for an equal rights amendment 
advance notice of plant closings and voluntary national public 
service 
kirk has instructed the platform committee and its chair 
michigan gov james j blanchard to produce a short visionary 
document not one weighted down with special interest planks 
the preliminary draft also denounces south africa as a 
terrorist state as jackson wanted although it does not mention 
reagan or bush by name it derides voodoo economics and 
promises the democrats will promote peace and prevent war but 
not by trading weapons for hostages not by sending brave 
americans to undefined missions in lebanon and honduras and 
not by toasting a tyrant like marcos as a disciple of democracy

federal investigators probing possible 
corruption in defense contracts have videotaped evidence of 
pentagon officials allegedly taking bribes from consultants for 
inside information nbc news reported friday 
nbc citing sources it did not identify said the officials in 
the videotapes are victor cohen a deputy assistant secretary of 
the air force and james gaines a deputy assistant secretary of 
the navy 
the consultants on the videotapes nbc reported include melvyn 
paisley a former assistant secretary of the navy whose office was 
searched by federal authorities last week 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella denounced the 
officials who provided the information to nbc 
this is just a further example of the government trying their 
case in the press rather than waiting for specific allegations to 
try in court barcella said in a telephone interview friday 
night if they want to try a case about leaking government 
information they should stop leaking information 
federal authorities are investigating whether defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
nbc said officials close to the case said cohen would clear his 
calendar and leave the pentagon whenever a defense consultant would 
call the meetings were recorded and videotaped and money changed 
hands nbc quoted the sources as saying 
gaines also was videotaped meeting with consultants and highly 
confidential documents relating to pentagon contracts allegedly 
changed hands nbc said 
michael schatzow the attorney for gaines said friday night 
that he would have no comment on the nbc report 
ill just wait and allow everybody whos been reporting these 
stories to wait and be embarrassed later schatzow said 
a phone call friday night to the home of cohens attorney 
seymour glanzer was answered by a woman who said he was out for 
the evening 
the washington times reported friday that a congressional staff 
member who requested anonymity said that henry hudson the us 
attorney for the eastern district of virginia who is heading the 
investigation told members of congress that the fbi had videotaped 
some of the alleged crimes under investigation and agents had 
extensive tape and wiretap evidence 
both cohen and gaines have been temporarily reassigned to other 
duties since their offices were searched last week by investigators 
gaines already has begun cooperating with prosecutors and cohen 
is negotiating with the government on whether to do the same 
sources told the associated press earlier this week 
schatzow would not confirm that gaines is cooperating with 
authorities 
the los angeles times reported thursday that investigators 
believe gaines was a principal supplier of pentagon documents to 
paisley who was gaines boss until he left the government in 1987 
paisley and gaines worked together at boeing co in seattle in 
the 1970s

indians who have refused to leave 
rundown housing on federal land in the northern california town of 
central valley were ordered evicted friday by a federal judge 
us district court judge milton schwartz on friday granted 
summary judgment in favor of the government which sought the 
indians eviction because housing built originally for shasta dam 
workers is unsanitary and unsafe 
it isnt the happiest decision ive made schwartz said but 
added no evidence has been produced as to the rights of 
possession by the indians 
deputy us attorney steve lapham will draft the eviction order 
within 10 days he said he hopes to draft the order in a way that 
would avoid a physical confrontation between wintu indians and us 
marshals 
the more than 30 wintu indian men women and children at the 
60acre toyon site were joined for a time in february by scores of 
indians from other areas when eviction notices were last posted in 
the longrunning dispute 
the indians could not be reached for immediate comment in 
central valley 160 miles north of sacramento the residents do not 
have telephones and a woman the only person a reporter found at 
the site friday went inside a house when approached 
the indians attorneys mike bush and bob bryzman said after 
the court session that they were uncertain how their clients would 
react 
earlier this year mickey gemmill a toyon resident since 1984 
said it will be a defeat for indians nationwide if we are forced 
to leave here 
lapham who represents the us bureau of indian affairs said 
another of the buildings which have no utility services burned 
down recently theres a great deal of urgency to the eviction 
proceedings he said 
attorneys for the indians argued that their clients had a right 
to live on the land for a variety of reasons including the fact 
that their ancestors once occupied the region 
the attorneys said a court settlement in april 1987 between the 
government and a group representing some of the indians the 
toyonwintu center inc did not include all of the indians at the 
site the settlement ended the centers 15yearold permit to use 
the land 
however judge schwartz told attorneys bush and bryzman who 
work for legal services of california that they had submitted 
very speculative theories in support of the indians who remain 
at the site 
originally built in the 1930s for shasta dam construction 
workers the vacant toyon housing project was used by the bureau of 
indian affairs as a center for indians beginnning in 1971 
the agency decided in 1985 to demolish the buildings after they 
became run down about the same time electricity and water were 
cut off to the houses because of unpaid utility bills 
representatives of the toyonwintu center agreed last year to 
vacate the buildings under the court settlement an administration 
building and a shop would be the only buildings not razed 
the wintus would then be given eight years to become federally 
recognized as an indian tribe thereby eligible for federal funds 
which would allow the wintus to rebuild at the site

the army corps of engineers is planning a 
huge temporary dike on the bottom of the mississippi river to 
block a droughtinduced saltwater intrusion that threatens new 
orleans drinking water 
salt water from the gulf of mexico is ordinarily blocked from 
moving upstream by the rivers flow but the drought has dropped 
the river to its lowest level in 120 years said robert muller the 
state climatologist 
salt water which threatens not only water supplies but also 
marshes where oysters and other seafood grow reached 57 miles 
above the rivers mouth friday said corps spokesman bruce sossaman 
the 600000 dike of sand and clay will be constructed from bank 
to bank near myrtle grove in plaquemines parish 63 miles upstream 
from the mouth of the river the corps said new orleans canal 
street at the edge of the french quarter is at the 95mile mark 
the dike will be about 600 feet wide at the base 10 to 15 feet 
high and at least 45 feet beneath the surface so it wont disrupt 
shipping said sossaman 
salt which is heavier than water travels in a wedge along the 
river bottom 
we know this is going to slow the salt down said joe 
dicharry chief of the navigation section in the corps engineering 
division but we dont know how much 
construction is expected to take about 30 days and the barrier 
will be designed to wash away when the river flow returns to full 
volume he said 
sossaman said plans are for the structure to be built by mike 
hooks inc a lake charles la company already under contract to 
keep the river dredged in a broad area known as the port of new 
orleans 
what we hope to do now is to modify our contract with hooks 
so we can start on it next week sossaman said friday 
new orleans and several other communities along the river in 
south louisiana draw their drinking water from the river

a navy swimming instructor accused of 
literally scaring a recruit to death by holding him under water has 
been recommended for a courtmartial but five others accused in 
the incident should face lesser punishment a navy spokesman said 
friday 
petty officer 2nd class michael w combe an instructor at the 
navy rescue swimmer school was recommended for courtmartial by 
rear adm david r morris chief of naval air training said lt 
cmdr dennis hessler 
the navy accused combe of holding the head of airman recruit lee 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis under water after combe and other 
instructors pushed or tossed the trainee into a pool when he 
panicked and tried to quit the course 
morris in corpus christi texas recommended combes 
courtmartial to vice adm nr thunman chief of naval education 
and training the ranking officer in pensacola said hessler 
thunmans public affairs officer 
morris also decided to drop the manslaughter charges against all 
of the instructors except combe hessler said 
combe and four other instructors were charged with involuntary 
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery lt thomas a 
torchia the officer in charge of the school was accused only of 
dereliction of duty a lesser offense 
at a hearing earlier this month a pathologist testified that 
mirecki who had a phobia about being dragged under water died of 
sheer terror when he was forced back into the pool after trying 
to quit the course 
all five instructors were accused of shoving or throwing mirecki 
into the pool while combe was also accused of holding the young 
mans head under water afterward mirecki died either of heart 
failure brought about by fear or subsequently drowned the 
pathologist testified 
all six defendants could have faced courtsmartial but hessler 
said morris recommended that the other cases be resolved with 
nonjudicial punishment a proceeding known as an admirals 
mast that only determines punishment not guilt or innocence 
morris concluded that disciplinary action is appropriate 
hessler said 
the five have until monday to decide whether to ask for a formal 
courtmartial in hopes of clearing themselves outright or opting 
for the lesser hearing on punishment hessler said 
if courtmartialed and found guilty military defendants can get 
time in prison and be removed from the service those penalties 
cannot be imposed in a nonjudicial proceeding though lesser 
punishment such as a reduction in rank can be ordered 
besides torchia the others recommended for the admirals mast 
hearing were petty officers 1st class richard e blevins and david 
j smith and petty officers 2nd class frankie d deaton and john w 
zelenock 
thunman will review morris recommendations and make the final 
determination on whether combes case warrants a courtmartial 
hessler said 
mireckis sister lynn johansen also of appleton said she was 
not disappointed that some of the defendants could avoid a 
courtmartial 
the familys main concerns were to find out how her brother died 
and see that changes were made to prevent further deaths mrs 
johansen said the fact that new safety procedures were ordered at 
the school after the death showed that lee didnt die in vain 
she said 
lawyers for smith and blevins said they had been told that 
morris had decided to dismiss the most serious charge against them 
the involuntary manslaughter count but hessler said he could not 
confirm this 
several other defense lawyers declined comment

former gov evan mecham said friday he 
will go to court to overturn his impeachment conviction and return 
to office 
we think that its important to challenge this mecham said 
contending that leaving his conviction unchallenged would leave all 
public officials open to impeachment 
mecham said he will not seek any political office this year but 
will go to court in an effort to have his april 4 impeachment 
conviction overturned 
mecham in an interview on ktsptv also blasted firstterm sen 
john mccain a fellow arizona republican who has been mentioned as 
a possible running mate for vice president george bush the certain 
gop nominee 
mccain a firstterm senator called for mechams resignation in 
january 
no john isnt qualified to be vice president mecham said 
he doesnt have the intellect he doesnt have the stature he 
doesnt have the honesty he doesnt have the character that it 
takes and he certainly doesnt have the political foundation 
mccain who was speaking friday night in watertown sd on 
bushs behalf said former gov mecham is entitled to his 
opinion nothing surprises me 
mccain said he was not seeking the vice presidential nomination 
noting that other qualified candidates come from states with more 
electoral votes he has said he backs sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
for the gop second spot 
mecham and mccain are members of the arizona delegation to the 
national gop convention in new orleans aug 1518 
mecham was convicted by the senate on impeachment charges of 
misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund which he said 
he did not believe was state money and trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat he was acquitted june 16 
on criminal charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
the former governor said he probably would take his challenge to 
federal court although the decision will be up to his lawyers he 
also said it was uncertain how soon it will be filed 
gov rose mofford the democratic former secretary of state who 
succeeded mecham said earlier friday she plans to run for 
reelection in 1990

a proposal being sent to president reagan 
would allow the federal government to draw up emergency evacuation 
plans for nuclear power plants when local governments fail to do 
so published reports said friday 
the proposed executive order would give that authority to the 
federal emergency management agency a move that could clear a 
major obstacle to licensing the seabrook plant in new hampshire 
the wall street journal reported friday that white house aides 
said the proposed order was endorsed by a cabinetlevel group this 
week and could be considered by reagan as early as next week 
formally composing and issuing the order could take several weeks 
the aides said 
the portsmouth herald reported friday that a draft of the 
document directed fema to take immediately all action necessary 
to ensure the establishment and maintenance of emergency 
preparedness plans in circumstances where state and local 
governments fail for whatever reason to come forward with plans 
that is the case at seabrook where massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis has refused to submit emergency plans for six massachusetts 
communities near the plant the likely democratic presidential 
nominee says no plans could assure the safety of residents if there 
were a major radiation release 
seabrooks utility owners have submitted emergency plans in 
place of those dukakis refuses to sign but massachusetts and other 
opponents argue that utilities cannot legally pinchhit for police 
and other governmental agencies in a public emergency 
the draft order addresses that issue by instructing fema to 
ensure that the federal government in a radiological emergency or 
disaster is prepared to assume any and all functions and 
undertakings described 
seabrook spokesman rob williams said he was unfamiliar with the 
proposed order but said plant owners and industry groups have been

states rights to participate in the nuclear licensing process and 
to protect the health and wefare of their citizens 
the antinuclear clamshell alliance denounced the proposed

to a total collapse and corruption of federal regulation of

defense department and fbi investigators are 
probing the thefts of two small computers on two consecutive nights 
from the star wars offices in the pentagon a tightly controlled 
security area 
pentagon officials who asked not to be identified said friday 
the theft of one privately owned computer and one governmentowned 
computer occurred two months ago and appeared to be an inside 
job 
the thefts did not compromise any classified programs but were 
troubling because of the emphasis placed on physical security by 
the strategic defense initiative organization the pentagon unit 
responsible for the star wars antimissile program the sources 
added 
the thief or thieves entered the facility by sabotaging the 
security system protecting the star wars office local television 
station wjla reported friday videotape cameras failed to record 
the theft because they had not been loaded a common occurence in 
the high security office the abc affiliate citing unidentified 
pentagon investigators for the information 
maj bill oconnell a pentagon spokesman said in a statement 
that one privately owned standalone personal computer was stolen 
from offices within the sdios pentagon complex in early april 
since that theft the defense criminal investigative service 
and the fbi have been conducting an investigation the 
investigation to date leads us to conclude that no national 
security information was compromised in any way 
late friday the spokesman released a second statement saying 
agents were investigating a potentially related matter 
involving the disappearance of an ibm compatible at class 
personal computer from the sdio computer training center 
no classified materials of any sort are used in the training 
facility 
oconnell declined to elaborate but a source said the thefts 
occurred over the weekend of april 9 and 10 
the first theft involving a commodore personal computer owned 
by a midlevel manager in the kinetic energy program occurred 
between friday evening and saturday morning the second theft 
occurred between saturday evening and sunday morning the official 
said 
kinetic energy weapons are designed to destroy enemy missiles 
through the sheer force of impact 
according to the source investigators believe an sdio employee 
with the proper doorsecurity card and clearances entered the 
basement complex through the main doors where a guard was on duty 
but then left with the computers through another security door that 
is under television surveillance but not guarded 
the star wars office complex is one of the few areas of the 
pentagon building that is offlimits to those without a special 
security pass in addition to the normal building pass

the leftist sandinista government 
publicly urged the ussupported rebels friday to agree to renew 
talks here next week to end nicaraguas more than sixyearold 
civil war 
a statement by the presidential press office also suggested that 
if the rebels refuse a special preparatory meeting be held in 
miami to discuss prolonging the current ceasefire which ends june 
30 
the proposal coincides with a visit secretary of state george p 
shultz is making to nicaraguas neighbors guatemala honduras el 
salvador and costa rica june 29july 1 to discuss with the chiefs 
executives of the four countries the situation in central america 
it also coincides with calls in washington for the reagan 
administration to renew us military aid to the contras as the 
rebels are known shultz will not visit nicaragua 
the statement said the government made the proposal in a message 
that gen humberto ortega the defense minister sent earlier 
friday to alfredo cesar director of the contra umbrella group 
called nicaraguan resistance 
representatives from both sides have been negotiating one and 
off since march 21 to end the war agreeing so far only on a 
provisional ceasefire but they have been unable to agree on how 
to make it permanent and on contra demands the sandinistas 
undertake democratic reforms before the rebels lay down their 
weapons 
the original 60day truce ended may 30 and was extended by 
tacit agreement for 30 days more while the negotiations continued 
but the contras broke off the last round of talks june 9 in 
managua claiming the sandinistas were not negotiating on good 
faith over the reforms 
earlier this week ortega sent a message to the contras urging a 
new round of four days of talks in managua beginning sunday the 
rebel leaders have not replied 
ortegas brother president daniel oretega and other top 
officials have been claiming the shultz visit to the region is in 
preparation for either direct or indirect us military 
intervention in nicaragua 
president ortega repeated that claim friday night when he 
publicly urged sandinista soldiers to be ready to repel north 
american aggression and quash the contra mercenary forces 
ortega spoke at a rally of 30000 sandinista supporters in the 
main plaza of masaya a city 19 miles south of the capital 
today we face an enemy more powerful that somoza and his 
national guard and that is the government of the united states 
which is trying to destroy the nicaraguan revolution and does not 
accept the reality of our democratic and revolutionary process 
ortega said 
the sandinistas seized power in july 1979 after overthrowing 
the dictatorship of president anastasio somoza

mayflower descendant phoebe legere thinks her 
ancestors might be rocking and rolling in their graves over her 
nude photo spread in playboy 
she also plays with a rock band stars in an upcoming horror 
movie lightens her blond hair wears too much makeup and likes 
bodyrevealing outfits 
but the 26yearold entertainer is ambivalent about her debut as 
a centerfold and was initially reluctant to even do the spread 
she said the magazine niced her into doing the pictures at 
the time she said she felt devastated by the loss of a singing 
job and the failure of her first record which helped put her 
30000 in debt 
i was going through some very sad times she said in an 
interview i felt a little degraded i guess and i guess i wanted 
to degrade myself even more i guess i felt like i was just a piece 
of flesh anyway and i thought maybe i should make enough money to 
pay for my own funeral 
someone at playboy saw her picture on a promotional ad for a 
performance at carnegie hall and the magazine began courting her 
she recalled telling the editors under no circumstances will 
i perform nude im a mayflower descendant a vassar graduate with 
a 40 average an intellectual im a feminist 
she instead offered them erotic drawings she had done 
they said well this is fine but if you show us one 
nipple were going to make you very rich i said absolutely not 
im an accomplished musician i went to the new england 
conservatory of music 
she eventually agreed to do it 
they just wore me down she said i guess i just wanted a 
little attention i didnt have a boyfriend at the time i was a 
little lonely and thats about the size of it 
but life is pretty good these days for legere she has a part in 
toxic avenger ii for troma productions a new yorkbased 
company of lowbudget campy horror movies six of her songs will be 
in the movie 
she also has her own line of lingerie designs her own clothes 
and appears with her rock band blond fox 
in the recent movie mondo new york which critics trounced 
she performs one of her own works marilyn monroe 
legere is no longer the innocent 17yearold who came to new 
york from lexington mass to attend vassar college and take her 
shot as a musician 
i was totally preppy she recalled i was the flat shoe 
with my hair in a braid and no makeup and very politically 
correct 
and she said it got her nowhere so looked for inspiration to 
the excesses of nightlife in the east village 
it wasnt until i started learning from the models and the 
drag queens around me that i really began to attract attention 
she said 
she started to dress differently she padded her face with 
excessive makeup lightened her blond hair and showed off her body 
and her popularity grew 
but while she said she developed an appreciation of my own 
anatomy she says she remained true to her upbringing and her 
ancestry including isaac allerton and his daughter remember who 
rode the mayflower to freedom 
legere said she seeks a kind of freedom of expression freedom 
to be beautiful and to make beauty not just conform mindlessly to 
some commercial notion of what music should sound like or what 
women should look like 
she never quite felt comfortable in massachusetts 
there was great pressure to conform to be normal blend 
dont call attention to yourself wear brown she said all i 
ever wanted was to be a great musician 
still if largescale success comes her way she might have to 
tone down her act 
i sort of imagine that when i get to the top ill go back to 
not wearing any makeup and wearing my hair in a braid she said

new evidence has come in lately to buttress the 
widely espoused belief that the stock market makes no sense 
on may 17 the government reported a sharp drop in the trade 
deficit and the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 2122 
points 
on june 14 the government reported another sharp drop in the 
trade deficit and the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
2507 points 
at least one large bank ran advertisements noting these 
divergent performances and suggested its certificates of deposit 
as an alternative to stocks for people who wanted investments they 
could understand 
the bank had a point any investor with a strong desire for 
order simplicity and stability is probably better off avoiding any 
strategy that depends on the daytoday fluctuations of the stock 
market 
but to the charge that the market behaves irrationally its 
advocates respectfully plead innocent 
though the reasoning may get convoluted at times they say 
there is almost always a method behind the madness portrayed on the 
ticker tape 
in the case of the recent trade reports said hugh johnson an 
analyst at first albany corp in albany ny the explanation for 
the markets differing responses lay not far below the surface 
in both instances he noted the trade deficit declined 
significantly 
however the decline in the march deficit reported in may 
signaled that the economy may be strengthening and the decline in 
the april deficit reported in june signaled that the economy may 
be weakening 
the march trade deficit improved because exports surged 
suggesting that domestic demand in west germany japan etc was 
strengthening and was placing pressure on us manufacturers to 
meet that demand 
this was viewed by the financial markets as inflationary 
the april trade deficit improved because imports declined 
suggesting that domestic demand in the us was slowing this 
suggested inflation may not be as big a problem as it has been made 
out to be 
the two events when taken together and reviewed along with 
the markets reaction to other recent releases demonstrate how 
important it is to the financial markets that the economy slows 
down from the pace of the prior three quarters 
in other words stock traders reactions to the trade reports 
were simply a new variation on a theme that has become familiar on 
wall street in the 1980s good news is bad news and vice versa 
favorable news for nearterm business activity conjures up 
images of increased inflation rising interest rates and 
credittightening by the federal reserve all of which could serve 
as prelude to a recession 
unfavorable news for nearterm business activity evokes visions 
of reduced inflation falling interest rates and stimulative credit 
policy from the fed all of which could set the stage for renewed 
growth later on 
suppose you have worked your way through all this and you still 
dont buy it 
how could one monthly report on a single aspect of the economy 
send fears of inflation rippling through the market and another 
four weeks later persuade thousands of investors that things were 
not so bad after all 
well one could argue expectations do not really change that 
radically when the market rises or falls 20 points as measured by 
the dow it is actually moving up or down by about 1 percent to 
adjust for the latest information received 
and at the same time one could acknowledge that this 
adjustment process is emotional messy and sometimes outright 
violent 
most devotees of the stock market will readily admit to all 
that just dont try to tell them it is nonsensical

imagine edward r murrow trying to sell cbs 
landmark 1960 documentary harvest of shame to nbc programming 
executives these days 
murrow this is an important story americans dont realize 
the very food they eat is reaped by oppressed migrant farmworkers 
who live in squalor plagued by poverty disease indifference 
 
nbc executives well it might fit in our summer showcase 
documentary series but its so depressing there are no 
celebrities just poor people who arent even violent or anything 
murrow a television network is supposed to inform the 
public 
nbc executives yeah but did you see the lousy demos on that 
homeless documentary 
murrow is that all you people care about ratings 
nbc executives no no of course not what if we got 
robert redford to narrate it 
the network that has been no 1 in the ratings for three years 
but just cant seem to find room for a primetime news show the 
last tellingly enough was 1986 has chosen the season of 
least viewership to run a series of documentaries packaged as a 
yattayattayatta kind of entertainment event summer showcase 
the first airing tuesday is of macho and men another of 
the lifestyle documentaries that are becoming endemic to nbc 
admittedly entertaining and highrated they offer little new 
information and their point of view is about as sharp as a 
marshmallow 
life in the fat lane was a mostly lighthearted look at the 
length to which americans will go to stay thin and scared 
sexless took a walk down the welltrodden path of sexual 
attitudes in the age of aids 
women in prison was an exception a thoughtful informative 
portrait of a part of society that most americans tend to think of 
in terms of stereotypes 
and nbc has had a few worthwhile hardnews documentaries 
notably last years home street home about the homeless and 
six days plus 20 years a dream is dying a hardball look at 
the situation on the west bank from the viewpoint of the 
palestinians 
summer showcase will offer at least one serious documentary 
the pension cookie jar a last offering from legendary producer 
reuven frank before he retires to take a fellowship at columbia 
universitys gannett center 
in of macho and men correspondents deborah norville and 
lucky severson interview men who complain of a variety of ills 
from being wrongly accused of sexual harassment to getting shot 
pointblank by an angry wife but the correspondents offer no point 
of view and might as well have turned to the camera shrugged and 
broken into a chorus of aint that a shame 
norville interviews an inarticulate male strip teaser at the 
nightclub chippendales for his opinion on like whatever evidence 
of malebashing is provided by clips of sam the bartender being 
clobbered by various females in the nbc sitcom cheers hey why 
pass up an opportunity to publicize the real entertainment on the 
network 
there is one enlightening segment a comparison of two cases of 
sexual abuse of minors one involving a 14yearold girl seduced 
by a male teacher the other a boy the same age seduced by a female 
librarian the male teacher got 12 years in prison the librarian 
got no jail time a judge didnt think a boy could be 
psychologically damaged by such an experience 
then back to heartwarming segments as fathers show they are 
good parents too not exactly stopthepresses stuff there is 
passing reference to the number of divorced fathers who dont pay 
child support 
norville sums up with the courageous stand obviously we 
havent resolved any of these conflicts but what we hope weve 
done is open some eyes equality is a twoway street and more and 
more men are realizing these days they havent always gotten a fair 
deal 
maybe nbc viewers will start noticing the same thing isnt 
there a rerun of thirtysomething on the other channel

in a moment of abandon one march day a 
year ago in a respite from finality henry brod and his wife li 
dined on roast duck and white wine at their favorite restaurant and 
topped off the evening by watching ballet star rudolf nureyev 
dance it was one of those rare days 
then li 61 suffering from terminal cancer went home to die by 
eating jello laced with the powder from 35 seconal capsules 
washing it down with bourbon henry had helped her get the 
barbiturates in small doses from two doctors under the pretense 
that she was having nightmares they had planned her death together 
but she would choose the time a little after midnight march 12 
1987 without telling her husband 
facing pain and surgery without hope of cure she decided on a 
good death rather than a lingering one says brod a 63yearold 
psychologist the means was suicide morally and spiritually we 
were together she took her own pills i was not involved in the 
legal sense 
the brod case several recent mercy killings and a sensational 
article by an anonymous physician in a leading medical journal 
have given a fresh impetus to the long dispute over whether when 
and in what circumstances euthanasia would be legally warranted 
proponents of euthanasia tried to get the issue on the november 
ballot in california but fell short of the required number of 
signatures on their petition 
that campaign caused less of a stir nationally than an article 
its over debbie in the journal of the american medical 
association in january the author whose name has never been 
disclosed described the mercy killing through an injection of 
morphine of a 20yearold woman who was dying of ovarian cancer 
some physicians including dr john h burkhart chairman of the 
amas council on ethical and judicial affairs have questioned the 
authenticity of the account because some details dont jibe 
we performed no independent investigation so we cant assure 
you whether the event occurred says dr george d lundberg the 
journals editor we believe the author to be telling the truth 
many people who have been speaking loudly about this case have 
assumed it was current and in this country neither assumption is 
necessarily true our journal is read in every country in the world 
and we receive articles from very many countries 
in any case lundberg adds whether the essay was true or not 
is irrelevant to our purpose our plan was to stimulate debate on 
the subject of suffering and dying from many viewpoints we 
succeeded extremely well 
lundberg says the journal received about 300 letters one of the 
highest number ever for the publication and that as a followup it 
ran 10 pages of letters editorials and commentary he said the 
article resulted in workshops and seminars across the country 
particularly on university campuses and debate in the letters 
columns of many newspapers 
there is now more than ever a serious concern about prolonging 
dying by technological means and there is much debate about the 
process of dying and the alleviation of pain he says 
all of this is occurring at a time when the netherlands allows 
thousands of terminally ill patients to be put to death by doctors 
without prosecution and california has been considering a 
referendum to legalize euthanasia 
the national hemlock society a los angelesbased organization 
with 24000 members and its political arm americans against human 
suffering are proposing legislation in california that would allow 
doctors to give terminally ill adults lethal doses of drugs upon 
the patients written request 
the present law permits the withdrawal or withholding of 
lifesupport systems such as respirators under certain conditions 
these include a living will signed by the patient specifying he or 
she does not want to be kept alive by artificial means or a power 
of attorney if the person becomes incompetent or incapacitated 
thirtyseven other states and the district of columbia have 
adopted similar living will laws a number of other states have 
recognized the patients right to refuse treatment through court 
decisions 
under the proposal in california the humane and dignified death 
act two physicians must certify that the patient would die within 
six months the patients signed declaration must be witnessed 
independently by two people who would not stand to gain from the 
death the family must be informed and anything they say must be 
considered even though they cant stop it

the first effort failed when americans against human suffering 
got only 250000 valid signatures of the 372128 required by the 
may 8 deadline to put the issue on the california ballot 
the hemlock society and americans against human suffering plan 
to try again in 1990 not only in california but also in oregon 
washington state and florida 
the hemlock society draws its name from the hemlock weed that 
ancient greeks used in suicide it was founded in 1980 by derek 
humphry a 58yearold english journalist and his second wife ann 
wickett 
humphry the societys director watched bone cancer ravage his 
first wife jean for 2 years when the couple was living in 
england they talked about their plans for euthanasia for nine 
months she asked him to help her and picked the day march 29 
1975 
on that day humphry made her a mug of coffee mixed with 
sleeping pills and pain killers that he obtained from a doctor 
friend he placed it on the table beside her they embraced she 
said goodbye my love fifty minutes later she was dead at age 
42 
only a close circle of friends shared his secret until three 
years after his wifes death when he published a book about his 
experience jeans way which tipped off law enforcement 
officials he offered to plead guilty but english authorities 
decided against prosecuting him 
by the time the book was published in america in 1979 he was 
living in the united states moving from the sunday times of london 
to the los angeles times deluged by invitations for speaking 
appearances and hundreds of letters asking for help he says he 
started the hemlock society 
the society publishes a suicide manual let me die before i 
wake which humphry says sells 1500 copies a month 
obviously a fair number of people are using it he says 
isnt it better that there be a tougher law a tougher standard 
rather than the covert way its happening now 
it was this book that the brods used to plan lis suicide after 
hearing humphry speak in sarasota she had the pills for two months 
before choosing her time of death 
every night i was wondering if shed do it says brod now 
an eastern regional director of the hemlock society once li had 
her 35 pills she was free of all worry anxiety of all the panic 
that had to do with slow painful death we had decided to go out 
and have all sorts of fun and do all of the things she wanted to 
do 
brod was questioned extensively by the county sheriff but no 
charges were filed against him 
while both he and humphry walked away free men that was not the 
case with charles griffith and roswell gilbert both serving 25 
years in florida jails without parole for mercy killings 
susan m wolf an associate for law at the hastings center a 
research institute on medical ethics in briarcliff manor ny is 
troubled by the inconsistency and the enormous room for 
prosecutorial discretion in mercy killings 
i think the consensus among legal scholars remains that it 
should not be legalized she says one of the proposals has 
been to recognize mercy killing as a defense to a homicide charge 
or in some ways treat mercy killing separately and more leniently 
currently it amounts to homicide but prosecutors handle it very 
differently so we have the extreme of the gilbert case all the way 
to complete nonprosecution 
by his own account in a recent telephone interview and in 
testimony at his trial gilbert shot his wife of 51 years emily 
to death on march 4 1985 as she lay on a sofa in their fort 
lauderdale condominium her mind wasted by alzheimers disease her 
body brittle from the bone disease osteoporosis she was 72 
roswell i love you dearly she told her husband a retired 
electronics engineer why does everybody hurt me so i dont hurt 
anybody somebody please help me please god somebody help me 
whos that somebody but me you know gilbert asked himself 
and there she was in pain and all this confusion and i guess if i 
got cold as ice water thats what had happened i thought to 
myself ive got to do it its got to be mine ive got to end 
her suffering this cant go on 
griffith shot his 3yearold daughter joy to death on july 3 
1985 in a miami hospital where she had been for eight months with 
brain damage suffered when she got her head caught in a recliner 
chair the oxygen to her brain was cut off long enough so that she 
was left in a chronic vegetative state

they cut a hole in my babys throat for the machine 
griffith wrote in a letter from his jail cell published in the july 
1987 issue of hemlock quarterly they drilled a bolt into her 
head to monitor her brains swelling they also put a tube in her 
stomach to feed her through and splints on her arms and legs to 
keep her from curling up 
griffith said he tried everything to wake her up but nothing 
worked 
i would rub lemon juice saltwater and sugarwater on her lips 
i would put hot and cold washcloths on her arms and legs telling 
her this is cold joy or this is hot honey i also flashed 
different colored lights in her eyes telling her what each color 
was i would sit there and stroke her and cry and i heard her ask 
me not to let her hurt anymore i know that joy is in heaven she 
can see talk play and laugh again 
griffiths attorney benedict p kuehne called his case a 
tragedy for the criminal justice system which is not equipped to 
resolve the problem of misguided mercy killings and thus must 
resort to murder prosecutions when such cases do not belong in that 
category 
the hemlock societys humphry says it does not approve of 
violent mercy killings but that in the cases of gilbert and 
griffith they had no choice because nobody offered them a legal or 
better way out 
the american medical association and many doctors like burkhart 
the chairman of its council on ethical and judicial affairs oppose 
active euthanasia 
it is murder or manslaughter depending on what the court 
says burkhart says as long as it is illegal that in itself 
is enough for the ama to oppose it its against the medical oath 
to kill you cant be a healer and a killer at the same time 
just the same 60 percent of 2218 colorado doctors responding 
to a survey in that state said they have had patients for whom they 
thought euthanasia would be justified if legal almost all said 
they would have given them a lethal drug if allowed 
in one form or another euthanasia is being practiced by 
decent professionals and supported by the affected patients says 
dr frederick abrams associate director of the center for health 
ethics and policy at the university of colorado at denver yet it 
is opposed by large numbers of people we must develop consensus in 
colorado concerning legal and ethical ground rules 
ama guidelines allow for passive euthanasia the equivalent of 
withholding and withdrawing care from terminally ill patients on 
their instructions in a recent survey by the ama 78 percent of 
1000 randomly selected physicians said they favor withdrawing 
lifesupport systems including food and water from hopelessly ill 
or irreversibly comatose patients if they or their families request 
it 
like many other doctors nancy dickey a family physician in 
richmond texas sees a distinction between active and passive 
euthanasia 
i think its difficult to maintain the trust my patients have 
when i also become an executioner she said i have an 
obligation when patients are facing death to make that dignified 
and as painfree as possible there is a difference in me no longer 
delaying that from happening and in me deciding on the time and 
place and mechanism of death doctors have been known to be wrong 
both about diagnosis and time schedules 
at griffiths trial a pediatric neurologist testified that the 
deeper areas in the base of his daughters brain were spared 
damage that she was showing progressive recovery could breathe by 
herself could see and possibly hear and could tell who was taking 
care of her 
in the gilbert trial emily gilberts doctor testified that a 
month before her death she was having less pain from her 
osteoporosis that she suffered no physical pain from alzheimers 
and that she could have conceivably lived another 5 to 10 years 
but roswell gilbert says he was desperate that he didnt know 
which way to turn that he just went over the edge he says he has 
no regrets even though he will be 100 years old by the time his 
sentence is up 
if shed continued to live shed have suffered a lot more 
than im suffering in here he says

while some see growing support for active euthanasia in certain 
segments of the american population many leading experts on 
medical ethics lawmakers doctors lawyers and religious leaders 
remain strongly opposed 
for some the answer is living wills directives to withhold 
treatment and to give them as much drugs as required to keep them 
free of pain even if it speeds up their deaths in cases of 
incurable illnesses or irreversible injuries where two examining 
doctors certify there is no hope for recovery 
dr john burkhart chairman of the american medical 
associations council on ethical and judicial affairs personally 
opposes euthanasia but says 
i think attitudes have changed to where active euthanasia 
would find favor with many people and perhaps many of the newer 
physicians 
burkhart a 67yearold family physician in knoxville tenn 
who has been practicing 40 years believes active euthanasia will 
be the next step he cautions that it would require many 
restraints consultations and supporting opinions 
but theres a lot of problems with that he says because 
once you get to where you can practice active euthanasia for people 
who are terminally ill the next step is to begin to do it for 
people who are mentally incompetent old and with no place to live 
just in the way costing the family money getting in their hair 
sooner or later it gets to the place where the unwanted are 
the ones for whatever reason at risk 
daniel callahan a noted author and expert on medical ethics who 
is the director of the hastings center says he opposes active 
euthanasia because he too thinks the potential for abuse is great 
and because he has not been persuaded that there is a desperate 
need for it 
callahan and another author expert dr eric j cassell 
professor of public health at cornell university medical college in 
new york city say that doctors are not trained well enough in 
making patients last days comfortable and do not give them enough 
painkillers 
the reasons callahan says are that marijuana and heroin both 
painkillers are not legally or morally accepted that there is a 
lingering fear that patients will become addicted to other drugs or 
that heavy doses may shorten their lives 
theres a feeling if you do that you might be accused of 
murdering the patient he said so theres a kind of wariness 
of going too close to that line and the result is that they stay 
too far away from the line i dont think that legally or in terms 
of medical ethics it has been historically considered wrong to 
provide pain relief even if it may have the effect of shortening 
life

allan bakke will say he has been working two 
years as an anesthesiologist in a southern minnesota town best 
known for the mayo clinic 
but the conversation ends there bakke who claimed reverse 
discrimination 15 years ago when his application for medical school 
was passed over in favor of minority applicants has maintained 
silence over the case by refusing all requests for interviews even 
with his colleagues the subject is taboo 
i just really dont want to do it at all bakke said to an 
interview request when reached by telephone at the olmsted medical 
group in rochester where he went on staff aug 11 1986 
according to the state medical examiners board the 48yearold 
minneapolis native earned his medical degree june 18 1982 from 
the university of california medical school at davis he served a 
fouryear residency at the mayo clinic and was licensed to practice 
medicine in minnesota in 1983 his file at the medical examiners 
board is free of any disciplinary reports 
it would have been unfortunate had he not been able to pursue 
his career said dr gary oftedahl medical director at the 
45doctor olmsted clinic like any of us he could be replaced 
but it would have been unfortunate 
oftedahl said bakke doesnt socialize with his colleagues at the 
clinic and is known for his quiet demeanor 
he does a good job making patients feel comfortable before 
they go into anesthesia oftedahl said hes conscientious 
bakke once led a fight to keep a federal prison out of a 
rochester neighborhood said dr gertrude tyce who worked with 
bakke as a member of the olmsted citizens for a better community 
the groups effort failed even though a nonbinding referendum on 
whether the city should allow the prison drew a record number of 
voters who overwhelmingly opposed the prison 
tyce said the referendum was bakkes pet project 
i think allan is a great guy she said hes a very 
straightup guy right is right and wrong is wrong 
but like oftedahl tyce noted that bakke steadfastly avoids 
discussing the 10yearold us supreme court decision that cleared 
his path into medical school 
we thought he was sort of a local celebrity and introduced him 
as such tyce said he changed the subject immediately 
the blueeyed blondhaired bakke who worked 11 years as a 
research engineer for nasa before studying to be a doctor lives in 
a 210000 house just outside the city limits which he bought in 
october 1986 with his wife judith according to olmstead county 
real estate records the couple has at least two children oftedahl 
said 
according to records at the state board of medical examiners 
bakke attended high school in coral gables fla and earned his 
engineering degree from the university of minnesota from there he 
joined the marines where he earned the rank of captain 
he scored an 803 percent average on his national board 
certification examination more than 5 percentage points above the 
passing threshold according to his application for a medical 
license

the first days of summer brought record heat little rain and 
wilting hopes of averting the dust bowl of 1988 
watching a drought is almost like watching paint dry said 
ron affeldt director of the office of emergency management in 
hardhit north dakota but out there today it is happening fast 
extremely fast 
the impact was measured not only in failing crops but in 
frantic commodity trading surging electric power demand 
restrictions on lawnwatering and carwashing in dozens of towns 
and shipping backed up on the no longer mighty mississippi the 
river was 20 feet below its yearago levels at memphis tenn 
where more than a thousand barges were stranded 
in some respects it was already a lost summer rain could still 
save some crops said kansas agriculture secretary sam brownback 
but the pastures are so short theyre never going to get ahead of 
the herd theyre past their growing 
however agriculture secretary richard lyng said thursday that 
hard steady rains in the next two weeks could still prevent major 
damage and that it was still too early to commit federal money to 
drought relief 
in the past week the drought was measured in many ways 
the us department of agriculture listed 1231 counties 40 
percent of the total as having a drought emergency 
the us geological survey reported that the number of streams 
with normal flow in may was the lowest in six years with only 54 
percent of 191 river measuring stations at normal or better 
streamflows in california were 42 percent below average in may the 
saline river in arkansas had only 10 percent of normal flow while 
the tombigbee river at coatopa ala was 15 percent of normal 
sixtyone cities had record high temperatures on tuesday 64 
set records on wednesday and 35 on thursday 
cows were selling for 39 cents a pound down from 5152 cents 
two weeks ago as farmers rushed to get rid of herds they could no 
longer feed 
tom george administrator of soil conservation service erosion 
surveys said wind erosion damaged 131 million parched acres in 
the great plains this year about three times the annual average 
corn prices have doubled in a month from 170185 in may 
to 348 at thursdays close soybeans nudged close to 11 a bushel 
for july delivery 
with the corn crop each week that goes by without rain means 
another 10 percent is lost said joel karlin an analyst with 
research department inc in chicago some estimate anywhere from 10 
percent to 30 percent of the us corn crop already has been ruined 
while that was bad news for consumers farmers with adequate 
rain and those with grain in storage stood to reap windfall profits 
im afraid were going to lose some farmers and weve lost 
enough already in my state said gov george sinner of north 
dakota one of 10 midwest governors who met with lyng in chicago 
last week 
the bottom line for consumers the agriculture department said 
is a 1 percent increase in food prices if the drought persists 
grainbased foods such as bread and pasta were likely to 
increase the most economists said but drought was also likely to 
raise the price of beer barley a prime ingredient in beer had 
increased from 255260 a bushel to 430450 since june 6 
said marge jones owner and publisher of the brewers bulletin in 
woodstock ill 
low river levels also posed a pollution threat because there 
wasnt enough water in many places to properly dilute sewage and 
other wastes 
flows were barely adequate to handle discharges from pulp and 
paper mills along the fox and wisconsin rivers said bruce baker 
director of water resource management for wisconsins department of 
natural resources 
once a flow drops below risk level waste from the plants 
exceeds a rivers capacity to assimilate it baker said at 
that point we must just sit back and watch the fish die 
but its not so easy to raise levels even where stored water is 
available the army corps of engineers found that discharging water 
from the gavins point dam on the south dakotanebraska border might 
wash awy the nests of piping plovers and interior least terns both 
federally protected species

the kansas city star sometimes you forget the river has all 
kinds of users not just people 
the dry heat raised concern about the dreaded greenhouse 
effect the theory that all the carbon dioxide pumped into the 
atmosphere by our cars furnaces and factories was warming the 
climate 
global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe 
with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship 
between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming james 
hansen a climatalogist at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations goddard institute for space studies in new york 
city told a congressional committee 
however hansen added there was no way to prove the 
greenhouse caused this heat wave

editors note its a school for doityourself sheep shearers 
in western pennsylvania where sheep farmers are largely 
parttimers who have small flocks of 50 or less but somebody still 
has to shear them and therein lies the problem commercial shearers 
dont want to fool with small flocks

shearing a sheep is nothing like cutting hair 
theres no delicacy no style and no one seems to mind if the 
customer suffers a few nicks scrapes or even gouges as long as 
theyre not near a vital organ 
the idea is to cut off the fleece as quickly as possible 
because like little boys sheep get fidgety around barbers 
its harder than it looks says shirley mounts of 
claysville wiping the sweat off her brow with the back of a hand 
after tackling a halfshorn ewe seeking freedom im always 
afraid im going to cut the daylights out of them 
one sad ewe ambled off with about four sizable cuts but nobody 
seemed concerned 
theyre a long way from the heart remarked one student as 
mrs mounts 32 fretted over her blunders 
mrs mounts was one of 18 sheep fanciers who recently took a 
class on how to cut fleece without cutting the animal the twoday 
program sponsored by the washington county agricultural extension 
office is held once a year during the spring shearing season in 
this hilly farmstudded corner of southwestern pennsylvania 
sheep farmer david horn opens up his large wooden barn perched 
on a slope overlooking neatly grazed pastures and provides 
students with as many customers as they need to hone their 
skills in return horn gets about half of his flock of 180 shorn 
for free although the results are a little ragtag 
i was going to experiment with mine but im sort of glad i 
didnt i think i would have killed them said dave krupski 30 
who raises 15 sheep on a relatives farm in independence township 
its hard work believe it or not a lot of them arent lambs 
theyre lions some will sit and lay in your lap but the ones with 
the horns are real feisty ive done five sheep in eight hours and 
they say the australians can do a sheep every 1 minutes 
agricultural extension agents say that after two days of 
classes students are able to shear a sheep in about five minutes 
speed means money to commercial shearers who charge about 2 a 
head but for the students who just want to learn enough to shear 
their own flocks speed means the difference between doing it right 
and not doing it at all 
sheep get fussy if theyre fussed over for too long 
after years of hard times sheep farming in this country is on 
the rebound in the west its a fulltime job because flocks 
number in the hundreds and thousands but in eastern states like 
pennsylvania sheep farmers are largely parttimers who have small 
flocks of 50 or less says the appropriately named joanna shepherd 
of the washington county extension service 
in washington and neighboring greene county the states two 
leading sheepraising counties commercial shearers are a premium 
she says sheep farmers particularly those with small flocks have 
been turning to the classes mainly because they cant find anyone 
to do the job 
last year nine people signed up for beginning sheep shearing 
this year 22 wanted to attend but four had to be turned away 
because there werent enough instructors 
we have only 35 sheep people dont want to be bothered with 
them says bill smith 39 of lagonda then when you do find 
someone they dont show up till the end of june and your sheep 
are about dying from the heat 
at one end of the barn extension agent ed wood coached a 
teenage boy on the importance of keeping his free hand away from 
the clippers sharp teeth 
get your hands out of the wool or youll cut yourself wood 
barked over the incessant buzzing of a dozen clippers 
but as the teen moved his hand away he failed to pull the skin 
taut causing the clippers to leave about a inch layer of fuzz 
youre leaving too much wool on her wood complained if 
you sold wool you wouldnt have enough money to go out on saturday 
nights 
to get the maximum value for a fleece it has to be cut closely 
with long strokes so it comes off all in one piece shearers start 
from the back left side work up to the belly head and back and 
then repeat the procedure on the right side ending up at the back 
right leg 
proper clipping technique means nothing though if the shearer 
cant pin down a struggling 130pound sheep 
you need to know where to put your legs how to hold the 
animal how to stretch their skin ms shepherd says you 
concentrate on how to get the wool off later 
for horn and most of the countrys sheep farmers who mainly 
raise sheep for meat wool is a secondary commodity a fleece from 
most meat breeds weighs about five pounds with the price per pound 
averaging just under 1 ms shepherd says after paying for the 
price of shearing the farmer makes about 3 per animal from the 
wool 
if the fleece is cut improperly or is too dirty or coarse he 
gets even less 
sheep are shorn late in the spring after cold weather has passed 
but before the onset of summers high temperatures domestic sheep 
have to be shorn once a year to maintain a highquality fleece and 
to rid the animal of accumulated dirt and parasites and it simply 
helps them feel more comfortable 
sometimes though their drastic change in appearance is 
unsettling especially to their own lambs 
a lot of them dont recognize their mothers at first horn 
says theyll bawl for a while 
an increasing number of people in pennsylvania are turning to 
sheep as a hobby or to supplement their incomes ms shepherd says 
people like sheep she says its an animal most of us can 
physically handle without a lot of fuss they dont take a whole 
lot they just eat grass and a little bit of grain and theyre 
nice they must be just look at what these students are doing to 
them

growth in the communications industry over the 
next five years should exceed the expected growth in the overall 
economy and expansion in other leading industries according to an 
investment banker that specializes in media deals 
the industry is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 
101 percent through 1992 down from its 109 percent expansion 
pace for the previous five years the firm veronis suhler amp 
associates inc reported tuesday 
the firms report covers revenue forecasts for radio 
television newspapers magazines recorded music books films and 
information services 
veronis suhler said gross revenue in the communications industry 
should rise to 218 billion in 1992 from 1349 billion in 1987 
the report said the overall economy is expected to grow at a 75 
percent rate annually over the next five years 
veronis suhler said the communications industrys growth will 
exceed what it expects will be the annual growth rates for 11 other 
major industries over the next five years including 96 percent in 
health and medical services 85 percent in educational services 
and 84 percent in electronic equipment 
it was the second annual fiveyear forecast from the investment 
firm last year it forecast a 103 percent growth in the 
communications business for the period 1987 through 1991 
a slowdown in the expansion of fastrising home video cable and 
business information segments accounted for the lower expansion 
projection for the next five years 
television broadcast ad spending is expected to rise 115 
percent a year to 404 billion by 1992 the report said that 
includes 85 percent annual growth in spending on the broadcast 
networks to 133 billion in 1992 it said 
network television will continue to lose both audience share 
and share of advertising dollars over the next five years the 
report said 
television stations revenues should grow at an annual rate of 
128 percent to 251 billion by 1992 the report said while 
barter syndication a system under which programs are exchanged for 
the rights to sell commercials on the shows will account for 
another 2 billion in revenue 
veronis suhler said the increased availability of quality 
programming should enable independent stations to compete more 
effectively with network affiliates 
cable television revenues are expected to grow at a rate of 92 
percent a year to nearly 16 billion by 1992 including 135 
billion from subscription fees and 25 billion from advertising 
the report said 
by 1992 veronis suhler estimates that 57 percent of the homes 
with televisions will have cable in 1992 up from 50 percent in 
1987 
higher basic cable fees are expected to propel a 104 percent 
annual growth rate in basic cable over the next five years but 
those higher basic cable fees and competition from rental cassettes 
should limit pay cable growth to less than 4 percent a year the 
report said 
radio revenues are expected to grow by about 10 percent a year 
to 1165 billion by 1992 
veronis suhler said newspaper revenues are expected to rise at a 
rate of 10 percent a year to 609 billion including 109 percent 
annual growth in advertising revenue and 62 percent annual growth 
in classified advertising 
book publishing revenues should rise 94 percent a year to 181 
billion in 1992 with the biggest increases expected in elementary 
and high school textbooks and in professional books the report 
said 
magazine revenues are expected to rise at an annual rate of 84 
percent to 214 billion including a 90 percent annual rise in 
consumer magazines and a 59 percent rise each year in business 
magazines 
the remainder of the revenue projection for 1992 includes 303 
billion in filmed entertainment 116 billion in business 
information services and 8 billion in recorded music

new heights to test its hiking and mountaineering socks the andes 
mountains 
thorlo a division of statesvillebased thornesburg hosiery 
co was the corporate sponsor of the american andes biomedical 
research expedition to several peruvian mountain peaks including 
22205foothigh mount huascaron 
while other participants such as nasa and new york university 
medical center conducted physical tests on climbers thorlo 
provided socks to be used in its own testing 
im a little tired but i loved it said michael shadroui 
thorlos national field coordinator who returned home last week 
after climbing 19000foot mount pisco 
my previous high climb was 14000 feet shadroui said in a 
telephone interview tuesday from the companys office the last 
5000 feet was a revelation 
the expedition which began june 4 and still is under way was 
sponsored primarily by new york university medical center medical 
research conducted during the climb included field tests for nasa 
and walter reed army hospital 
among the 17 climbers in the expedition were dr william 
bernhard of nyu medical center col thomas mader of the madigan 
army medical center in tacoma wash and col lawrence mohr the 
white house physician 
areas of study included altitude mountain sickness hypobaric 
hypoxia and brain response time at high altitudes shadroui said 
thorlo became involved in the expedition after a conversation 
six months ago between bernhard and jim thornesburg president of 
the privatelyheld hosiery company shadroui said 
thorlo usually tests its products in the field with fitness 
buffs hikers members of the ski patrol and long distance runners 
according to enid walker the companys director of communications 
thornesburg decided the peruvian expedition was an excellent 
opportunity to conduct tests on the companys hiking and 
mountaineering socks each climber was given a set of socks for 
testing of moisture management abrasion and thermal quality 
the temperatures ranged from 85 degrees during the day to 
subzero at nights said shadroui who also participated in a 
barrage of tests conducted by the medical teams 
results of thorlos own tests wont be known for some time 
shadroui said and much of the information will remain secret for 
competitive reasons based on the reaction of his fellow climbers 
the companys products apparently held up well under tough 
conditions 
dr bernhard said hed never been on an expedition with fewer 
foot problems shadroui said

washington growers worried that mushy 
apples could harm the reputation of the states fruit say its 
crunch time for the nations biggest apple crop 
a number of growers on thursday spoke in favor of a state 
agriculture department proposal to grade washington apples not only 
by external appearance but also by internal firmness 
we in effect would guarantee that apples have a good chance of 
reaching consumers with crunch and crispness said jim clements 
acting chairman of the washington association of apple growers 
such a proposal has been in the discussion stage for three 
decades and if adopted would make washington the first state to 
use such a standard for its apples the agriculture department 
after weighing testimony is to decide on july 6 whether to adopt 
the proposal 
at a public hearing in yakima most growers and industry 
officials supported the change saying it was needed to ensure that 
washington apples could compete with other states and countries in 
the international marketplace 
but others complained the proposal was an overreaction based on 
one bad crop and would reduce income for growers 
grower charles boone said production costs will rise next year 
as farm labor becomes scarcer because of federal immigration 
reform and said the timing of the change was wrong 
les barbee a zillah grower said the problem was with 
distributors and retailers not growers 
most all apples are good when they leave our warehouses he 
said in arguing against the change what happens en route to the 
market is the question that needs to be addressed 
the issue is of tremendous economic importance to washington 
apple growers who earned 489 million from the states biggest 
cash crop in 1986 
washington which produces half the nations supermarket apples 
and 80 percent of the exports has been saddled with a record crop 
this year that also suffered severe weather damage 
economic pressure is forcing many poor quality apples into the 
marketplace ruining consumer confidence and future sales some 
growers complained 
the junk sent out there for the consumer to buy is shameful 
said dave larson a grower who lives in bellevue ive seen our 
industry lose customer after customer this year 
with washingtons apple trees producing larger and larger crops 
repeat business is the key to economic survival said richard 
clements chairman of the washington state horticultural 
associations grade and pack committee which proposed the change 
apple grades which determine prices are based on color and 
other surface conditions like blemishes only controlled 
atmosphere apples those held in a special lowoxygen 
highnitrogen environment currently are under firmness standards 
while the controlled atmosphere apples are twothirds of the 
fresh market crop they are sold later in the year after the 
damage to consumer confidence has already occurred some growers 
contend 
the states growers are facing increasing competition from 
highquality apples from michigan new york and southern hemisphere 
nations said gaylord enbom a yakima grower 
we cant be like other industries in the us that failed to 
make changes when required he said

domestic cars but 08 percent fewer domestic light trucks than a 
year ago for a total 57 percent increase in combined sales

the nations heat wave is producing dangerous 
conditions at factories around the country few of which are 
airconditioned union officials say 
the risks of heat stress or stroke are greatest where heat isnt 
a normal part of working conditions said frank mirer director of 
the united auto workers unions health and safety department 
people who are not acclimated to the hot environment are at 
greatest risk mirer said if you dont consume sufficient 
fluids during the day you lose your acclimatization suffer great 
heat stress and greater risk of heat stroke 
in factories such as foundries and steel mills where workers 
and machines handle molten metal workers bodies are used to the 
temperatures and work rules help by providing more breaks and 
relief workers he said 
but where its not normally hot and humid workers bodies can 
become overheated as they try to discharge their own heat into 
uncooled air symptoms such as headaches nausea heat cramps 
fatigue and feeling funny can mean heat stress mirer said 
if the symptoms are being experienced they have to be rapidly 
reported to the medical department and action taken he said 
workers can get heat passes medical passes allowing them to 
leave hot areas 
at a chrysler corp factory in fenton mo workers blamed the 
death of a 54yearold paint shop worker wednesday on extreme high 
temperatures but an autopsy found the man died of a heart attack 
caused by diseased arteries 
several hundred workers in the paint shops of that plant and an 
adjoining chrysler factory walked off the job on wednesday and 
again on thursday complaining of temperatures as high as 110 
degrees 
heat stress is a very welldocumented medical condition 
governed by temperature humidity and the rate of work someone is 
doing diane factor industrial hygienist in the aflcios 
washington dc occupational safety health and social security 
office said thursday 
the heat can surpass the threshold of what your body can 
handle factor said 
during the heat wave that baked much of the nation this week 
temperatures in plants without air conitioning factories such as 
auto assembly and metal stamping plants climbed well into the 100s 
workers tried to keep cool by soaking towels in ice water 
drinking free beverages from vending machines and spending their 
breaks in airconditioned cafeterias 
its unbearable in that plant i dont have enough fans in my 
building said maurice mitchell an official of uaw local 1264 at 
chryslers 4000worker stamping plant in sterling heights 
mitchell said the mercury climbed above 110 wednesday in the 
plant he blamed the heat on a lack of outside air the plants 
windows are sealed to keep out cold and the union has to bargain 
with management for fans 
the federal occupational safety and health administration has no 
regulations governing heat in the workplace factor said 
the aflcio wants standards that would require air conditioning 
or other engineering means of cooling the workplace as well as 
rules that require longer more frequent breaks away from hot areas 
and machinery and switching of work shifts from the hottest parts 
of the day factor said 
heat stress is a preventable occurrence she said

union carbide corps plans to restructure 
its three worldwide businesses could be a prelude to the companys 
spinning off one of the companies to raise capital and reduce debt 
analysts said 
some analysts also said after union carbide announced the 
planned restructuring thursday that the company also could be 
trying to protect itself from lawsuits stemming from the 1984 gas 
leak in bhopal india 
union carbide chairman robert d kennedy also unveiled plans to 
spend 450 million to expand and add product lines at the companys 
plants in seadrift texas and taft la 
kennedy announced the new strategies after union carbides board 
approved a management recommendation seeking the new structuring 
the plan would have union carbide become the holding company for 
the newer companies 
the restructuring must be approved by shareholders 
carbide remains deeply indebted after fending off a hostile 
takeover two years ago by gaf corp analysts said as of march 31 
carbide reported total debt of 32 billion compared to total 
capitalization of 51 billion 
the 63 percent ratio of debt to capital is about twice that of 
carbides competitors and the company may hope to reduce that 
analysts said 
it gives them increased flexibility to raise capital in the 
future said leslie ravitz a financial analyst with salomon 
brothers inc in new york it opens up the potential to spin off 
pieces of their business to the public or to a third party 
james wilbur a vice president with smith barney harris upham 
and co inc said there has been speculation that carbide might 
want to restructure so it can go public with one division while 
keeping the others private 
wilbur said it was possible the company was restructuring as a 
defensive strategy to get the bhopal monkey off the operating 
divisions back although he viewed that as the the least likely 
motivation 
wilbur also said the restructuring could be strictly 
organizational 
carbide has long been an amalgam of different companies he 
said the feeling may have been that it had become too 
centralized for the nature of its business 
ravitz said carbide has a history of going through a 
restructuring every several years and dismissed any link to bhopal 
the indian government has filed 3 billion in lawsuits against 
carbide on behalf of all victims of the bhopal gas leak at least 
2660 people died in the accident the worlds worst industrial 
disaster 
the board also approved a proposed joint venture with allied 
signals uop subsidiary the deal will combine uop with carbides 
catalysts absorbents and process systems businesses

the 12 european economic community nations 
overcoming a greek veto threat on friday finalized an accord to 
limit spending on support prices for eec farmers this year to 319 
billion or twothirds of the total eec budget 
the longawaited agreement could blunt criticism by the united 
states that europe does not do enough to rein in farm subsidies 
while the 198889 farm package generally freezes prices at last 
years levels it cuts prices for some of the eecs 103 million 
farmers by as much as 5 percent officials said 
the deal was clinched after greece lifted its june 17 veto to a 
compromise deal keeping the farm budget at last years level 
the agreement calls for a gradual dismantling of the eecs 
socalled monetary compensatory amounts or mcas which comprise a 
highly complex system of border taxes on exports of farm produce 
from countries with weak currencies 
greek mcas now range from 291 to 48 percent last week the 
eecs executive commission proposed to offer greece a 145 percent 
cut including an immediate 10point reduction 
early friday greece accepted an immediate dismantling of its 
mcas by 15 to 20 points this adds at least 116 million to the 
farm budget but officials were confident they could keep overall 
spending at last years levels 
the agreement in effect means lower support prices for eec 
farmers for the second straight year last year prices declined by 
35 percent on average as part of a package that also generally 
froze subsidies 
in consultations with the united states the eec will likely use 
fridays accord to underscore that europe is serious about curbing 
farm subsidies after years of runaway spending that has brought the 
community to near bankruptcy 
the united states long a critic of the eecs farm subsidies 
has suggested an end to all such subsidies by the year 2000 
while the eec agrees that farm subsidies must be reduced to 
prevent the buildup of huge unmarketable surplus stocks of food 
it has rejected the proposal to do away with farm subsidies 
altogether as dangerous and undesirable

the supreme court in a ruling that will cost 
mississippi consumers 3265 million today limited severely 
states authority to lower the electric rates public utilities 
charge as a result of agreements with federal regulators 
the court by a 63 vote said mississippi authorities are 
required to pass through to retail electricity customers a 
utilitys federally determined share of the costs of constructing 
the grand gulf 1 nuclear power plant 
states may not regulate in areas where the federal energy 
regulatory commission exercised its jurisdiction to determine just 
and reasonable wholesale rates or to insure that agreements 
affcting wholesale rates are reasonable justice john paul 
stevens wrote for the court 
mississippi therefore may not conduct any proceedings 
that challenge the reasonableness of fercs allocation of costs 
stevens said 
mississippi power amp light co provides electric service to about 
330000 customers in the western half of mississippi 
its electric generation and transmission facilities are planned 
constructed and operated on a coordinated basis with those of three 
affiliated utilities arkansas power amp light co louisiana power 
amp light co and new orleans public service inc 
in all the companies provide electricity to customers in four 
states mississippi louisiana arkansas and missouri 
each of the four companies is a subsidiary of middle south 
utilities inc an interstate public utility holding company 
middle south in 1974 formed a new subsidiary to finance 
construct and operate a nuclear generating station grand gulf 1 
near port gibson miss it cost 36 billion to complete about 
500 percent more than originally anticipated and began operations 
july 1 1985 
after three years of proceedings the federal energy regulatory 
commission decided that the costs of grand gulf 1 should be 
shared equitably by all four operating companies and their 
customers 
it ruled that mpampl should be required to pay for 33 percent of 
the nuclear power plants cost 
the mississippi public service commission and various other 
governmental agencies and officials from mississippi arkansas 
louisiana and missouri appealed the commissions ruling but the 
us circuit court of appeals here upheld most of it last year 
the federal commissions decision required mpampl to pay enormous 
amounts of money for grand gulf 1 power and to get the money mpampl 
asked the state public service commission to approve a rate 
increase 
the state commission approved a 3265 million increase 
stretched over a 10year period but state attorney general edwin 
lloyd pittman and the mississippi legal services coalition 
challenged the state commission order 
the state supreme court overturned the rate increase refusing 
to accept as reasonable the federal commissions allocations of 
cost 
since mississippi cannot use 33 percent of grand gulfs power 
the federal commissions ruling providing for the allocation of 
33 percent of its cost would seem to be imprudent the state 
court ruled 
the state courts ruling was reversed today 
mpampl had told the justices that the state courts ruling 
conflicts with their 1987 ruling in a case from north carolina and 
tennessee 
in it the justices said states must allow as reasonable 
operating expenses the costs incurred by a utility as a result of 
paying a wholesale price determined by federal energy regulators 
todays decision against mississippi relied heavily on the 1987 
ruling 
mississippis effort to invade the province of federal 
authority must be rejected stevens wrote for the high court 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a 
blackmun dissented 
the case is mississippi power amp light vs mississipi 861970

americans personal income held back by a decline in subsidy 
payments to farmers rose a modest 03 percent in may the 
government said today 
but because of a decrease in federal tax payments which 
followed a big tax bite in april americans disposable personal 
income shot up 15 percent in may the commerce department said 
that followed a 10 percent decline in aftertax income in april 
the biggest drop since april 1987 
beforetax income had edged up 01 percent in april after a 12 
percent surge in march 
todays report said both the april and may increases look weaker 
because march income was boosted by profitsharing payments to auto 
workers and retroactive social security payments a lag in federal 
payments to farmers also held back the may advance 
excluding those special factors the government said personal 
income would have advanced 08 percent in april and 04 percent in 
may 
on thursday the commerce department said the us economy grew 
at a 36 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year 
still strong although less than the previously estimated 39 
percent rate 
separately the presidents council of economic advisers said it 
was confident enough in the economy this year to boost its growth 
forecast for all of 1988 to 35 percent from the original estimate 
of 29 percent 
our rosy forecast wasnt rosy enough beryl sprinkel 
chairman of the council of economic advisers told reporters the 
economy is doing better than even we expected 
in another report the commerce department said the aftertax 
profits of us corporations fell 10 percent in the first quarter 
the poorest showing since the first quarter of 1987 
frenzied trading in chicago pushed the july contract for 
soybeans to a 15year high but prices fell sharply when 
uncertainty about the weather caused a nervous wave of selling 
corn and wheat futures also retreated on the chicago board of 
trade while oats rose to record highs on fears of further damage 
to the droughtravaged crop 
were trading hysteria right now cathy leow a new 
yorkbased grain analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
said of the soybean markets erratic performance 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average fell 391 
points to 214829 following a nearly 70 point rise over the 
preceding two sessions 
after the october stock market collapse many private economists 
expected a slowdown or even a recession this year but the economy 
boomed 
the administration is looking for a sixth straight year of 
economic expansion the longest in peacetime since the civil war 
to bolster the chances for a republican presidential victory in 
november 
sprinkel said the expansion gives every indication of 
continuingon into next year 
a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 14 
percent slightly lower than the previously estimated 17 percent 
and well below the 27 percent pace of the fourth quarter 
the concern now is that too much demand from american 
consumers as well as from overseas buyers will strain factory 
capacity causing shortages and driving up prices later this year 
in other economic news automakers reported that sales of 
domesticmade cars and light trucks rose 128 percent in midjune 
from a year earlier resuming 1988s robust pace after a brief 
lapse earlier in the month

senate democrats today defeated a republican 
attempt to exempt employers from giving workers and local officials 
advance warning of large layoffs and plant closings if they provide 
60 days severance pay to laid off employees 
on a 5931 vote the senate rejected an amendment by sen dan 
quayle rind that would remove the obligation of employers to 
provide advance notice under a democraticsponsored bill if the 
severance pay is provided 
the practice of paying severance pay in lieu of notice is a 
common one and ought to be encouraged quayle said the earlier 
an employee can go out and develop some new skills and not be 
pinned down to a job that no longer is going to be there the 
better off that employee will be 
sen howard metzenbaum the primary author of the legislation 
said the amendment would defeat the bills primary purpose 
this bill is about giving notice its not about requiring 
severance pay metzenbaum said the object is not to put an 
additional financial obligation on employers 
the vote was the first in three days of senate debate on the 
bill as republicans attempted to stall a democratic effort to link 
enactment of the layoff notices to winning passage of a trade bill 
later 
senate democratic leaders had hoped to get a vote this week on 
the plant closinglayoff measure which has been separated from the 
trade bill that president reagan vetoed last month house leaders 
on thursday promised immediate action as soon as the senate 
finished its vote 
but gop opponents using lengthy speeches and long periods of 
silence thwarted any votes thursday while declining to offer 
amendments they had promised throughout the day to introduce 
were trying to make a case on this and the strongest case we 
can make is on one clearly defined amendment said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas we wanted to have that vote 
first 
however republicans agreed to allow votes today on other 
amendments aimed at weakening the notice requirements 
after caucusing in doles office republicans decided to have 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan offer an amendment to strip the word 
layoffs from the bill and make the mandated 60day advance notices 
apply only to plant closings 
sen orrin hatch rutah complained that advance notices in 
cases of layoffs will tilt the delicate labormanagement 
balance that now exists in favor of unions 
it makes it almost impossible for a business to lay off 50 
people when it needs to and it will discourage union leaders from 
negotiating productivity improvements he said 
mrs kassebaum however declined to offer the amendment 
thursday out of fear that opponents would vote it down immediately 
then she said she would be out of town friday effectively 
forestalling any action on her amendment or a final vote on the 
bill itself until at least next week 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said mrs kassebaums amendment 
would create a loophole big enough to allow an employer to lay off 
980 of 1000 employes at a plant without giving them any notice 
this is a killer amendment said senate majority leader 
robert c byrd dwva not only does it kill this bill but it 
will kill the trade bill 
democrats still hoped to send the plant closing bill to the 
white house by july 4 for an expected veto by reagan while holding 
a revised trade bill hostage to overriding the veto 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas with the backing of 71 other 
senators on thursday reintroduced without the plant closing 
provision the trade bill vetoed by reagan last month a similarly 
strippeddown bill was introduced in the house last week 
reagan cited the provision requiring employers to give workers 
and local officials 60 days advance notice of layoffs of 50 people 
or more as his main objection to the trade bill but he indicated 
he would sign a trade bill that did not include the layoff 
provision 
we may not get any but were not going to settle for half a 
loaf byrd said thursday ive maintained all along that the 
president doesnt want a trade bill 
organized labor leaders agreed to removal of the layoff notice 
provision from the trade legislation only on the condition that 
congress would act on it before reconsidering the trade bill 
since recent polls indicating that more than 80 percent of 
americans favor requiring businesses to provide workers with 
advance notice of layoffs and plant closings the issue has become 
a major campaign topic 
our cope people out in the field wanted another upordown 
vote on plant closing alone before the election one labor 
official said speaking of the aflcios committee on political 
education offices in the 50 states 
without enactment of mandatory layoff warnings as a separate 
law the aflcio has threatened to withdraw its pivotal support for 
any trade bill that does not include the provision 
we would have no reason to support it nor oppose it said 
rex hardesty a spokesman for the federation 
other supporters of the trade bill including many business 
groups acknowledge that the political impetus behind it might 
falter without labors support 
republicans admit the strategy has put them on the defensive 
the judgment has been made by the majority that this is a 
hot issue that ought be brought up and maybe we can singe a few 
republicans in the process said dole who might win in 
november suddenly has become the issue not the merits of this 
bill 
at least one republican senator standing for reelection sen 
john chafee of rhode island said he has switched during the past 
month from opposing the mandated notices to supporting them

italian financier carlo de benedetti 
ended his battle for control of societe generale de belgique on 
friday by announcing plans to sell most of his stake in belgiums 
largest holding company 
despite the outcome de benedetti said his bid for societe 
generale had been a financial success in an interview with italian 
television he estimated he earned about 1 billion from the sale 
of his stake 
i would like to repeat every six months what i did in the last 
six months de benedetti said at a news conference where he made 
the announcement 
under terms of a settlement de benedettis french investment 
firm cerus sa will sell 775 million societe generale shares to a 
rival francobelgian group cerus currently owns 1425 million of 
million societe generales 42 million outstanding shares 
in return de benedetti will boost his holding in cie 
financiere de suez a parisbased financial services group and his 
chief rival for control of societe generale suezs main ally is 
groupe ag belgiums largest insurance firm 
the agreement marked the end of a bitter battle for societe 
generale which started in january when de benedetti acquired 186 
percent of the company and vowed to buy at least 15 percent more 
the sale will reduce ceruss holding in societe generale to 16 
percent thus handing control of the company to suez and its 
allies the francobelgian group currently holds about 55 percent 
of societe generales stock 
in return de benedetti will obtain an undisclosed cash payment 
will raise his stake in suez to about 4 percent from the current 1 
percent and will be made one of three vice presidents of societe 
generale 
de benedetti said he did not believe he miscalculated his 
strategy particularly as he still will play an important role in 
the new management of societe generale 
the two sides said societe generale would continue to trade on 
the belgian stock market becuse they wanted once more to give the 
public greater access to the capital of societe generale 
most of societe generales stock was acquired by the two groups 
earlier this year at the height of the takeover battle when the 
price of societe generale reached record levels of 8000 belgian 
francs per share 
societe generale stock closed at 4495 francs on thursday 
a special shareholders meeting will be held soon to approve the 
new management structure of the holding company 
the two groups said the board would be invited to appoint de 
benedetti suez chairman renaud de la geniere and groupe ag 
chairman maurice lippens as vice chairmen of societe generale 
societe generale which has stakes in more than 1200 companies 
controls about a third of belgiums economy 
both de benedetti and the francobelgian group have said they 
want to turn the company into a paneuropean holding company ahead 
of the european economic communitys plans to eliminate trade 
barriers by the end of 1992

the united states canada japan and the 
european community concluded a round of trade talks today with 
negotiators saying they had reslved some questions but remained far 
apart on the contentious issue of farm subsidies 
at a news conference concluding the two days of meetings us 
trade representative clayton yeutter said that much more work was 
needed before the farm subsidy issue could be resolved and at least 
for the present the united states was not willing to modify its 
demand for the elimination of all subsidies by the year 2000 
we are not moving off any options maybe in 1990 we will make 
some adjustments but not in 1988 he said yeutter and the other 
trade ministers pronounced themselves pleased with the progress 
made on some other less contentious issues during the two days of 
talks at a resort in the minnesota lake country 
they said they had narrowed the differences separating them on 
expanding the rules governing global trade to include trade in 
services and investment two high priorities for the united states 
yeutter called the talks productive and wellfocused and 
said they would help pave the way for successful conclustion of a 
meeting of all 96 countries involved in the current trade talks to 
be held in montreal in december 
in addition to services and investment officials reported 
progress on other issues such as protection of intellectual 
property rights and reform of the process by which trade 
disagreements get settled 
the discussions by the four countries were aimed at narrowing 
the differences between them before a critical trade conference in 
montreal in december 
one area where officials said progress had been made was in 
reforming the process by which the 96member general agreement on 
tariffs and trade resolves disputes between countries 
everybody is in favor of a better dispute settlement 
mechanism said willy de clercq trade representative for the 
european community we have to make the system run smoother and 
quicker 
an american official who spoke on condition his name not be 
used suggested that the countries meeting in montreal could well 
agree to the removal of some trade barriers as early as 1989 
the current round of trade liberalization talks began in 1986 in 
uruguay and is scheduled to end in 1990 the montreal meeting is 
aimed at settling as many issues as possible and providing momentum 
for the two remaining years of negotiations 
but on the no 1 priority of the united states reform of 
agricultural subsidies all sides agreed they are far apart 
reflecting the heated debate that took place between reagan and the 
other six summit countries at the justconcluded toronto summit 
the 200 billion subsidy war has contributed to surplus 
production and slumping prices but the allies rebuffed reagans 
call for totally scrapping subsidies the final economic communique 
simply repeated language calling for further negotiations aimed at 
reducing subsidies rather than eliminating them 
yeutter said that congress could very likely increase export 
subsidies just as it did in 1985 if current global trade 
negotiations on the matter appear to be at a stalemate 
sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in 
order to achieve progress he told reporters here 
i am not making legislative threats i am just giving you an 
assessment of what could happen yeutter said 
in another form of pressure treasury secretary james a baker 
iii said earlier this week that countrybycountry trade deals 
such as the uscanada free trade agreement might be the way to 
force other nations to capitulate in their opposition to 
eliminating farm subsidies 
baker said that if the united states and canada join together 
the two countries may be able to dislodge obstacles in special 
areas of common concern such as agriculture 
all countries agree in principle that farm subsidies are a major 
drain on their treasuries but europeans claim that political 
pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support 
programs 
western europe the worlds largest food importer in 1970 is 
now second to the united states in the amount of food it exports 
the united states is still the worlds largest exporter of farm 
commodities accounting for about 40 percent of the volume of wheat 
and feed grains sold on world markets but since reaching a record 
of 417 billion in 1981 us farm exports steadily declined to a 
low of 266 billion in 1986

the jury in a case linking the hazards of 
asbestos and smoking found today that american tobacco co was not 
liable in a former shipyard workers lungcancer death but should 
have put warning labels on cigarette packs sooner 
the federal jury awarded no damages in the death last year of 
john ray gunsalus 55 of chester 
the case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in newark 
nj decided three tobacco companies should pay 400000 to the 
widower of a lifelong smoker it was the nations first monetary 
award against a cigarette maker 
the jury in the gunsalus case had to answer two questions were 
pall mall cigarettes prior to 1966 defective at the time sold in 
that they failed to provide a warning and were they a 
substantial cause of gunsalus death 
the panel answered yes to the first question faulting the 
company for not cautioning of the dangers of tobacco before 1966 
when warnings began to be printed on cigarette packages as mandated 
by congress 
to the second question the jury answered no to award damages 
it had to find that cigarettes were a substantial cause of 
gunsalus death gunsalus estate had sought an unspecified amount 
for pain and suffering 
attorneys for american tobacco cheered the verdict outside the 
courtroom but declined to comment to a reporter 
the eightmember jury had begun deliberations thursday 
american tobacco attorney edward f mannino had contended 
smokings dangers were not the issue but instead told the jury 
that gunsalus drank heavily suffered multiple stab wounds and had 
three heart attacks before dying of lung cancer 
attorneys for gunsalus estate tried to show american tobacco 
produced a defective product because cigarette packages carried no 
warnings for people who work near asbestos gunsalus worked for 
several years at a chester shipyard where asbestos was prevalent 
according to testimony from dr paul epstein of graduate 
hospital in philadelphia gunsalus died of cancer caused by smoking 
and asbestos exposure 
epstein a witness for the gunsalus estate said the interaction 
of asbestos and cigarette smoke causes a far greater risk of cancer 
than either substance does on its own 
in closing remarks thursday mannino said gunsalus smoked 
because he chose to he called gunsalus as a strongwilled 
person who ignored six doctors warnings to quit smoking 
nobody told john gunsalus what to do mannino repeatedly 
told the jury 
he described gunsalus as a heavy drinker who drifted from job to 
job lived with other women while still married suffered multiple 
stab wounds and three heart attacks before dying last year still 
unable or unwilling to give up his habit of smoking two packs of 
pall mall cigarettes a day 
thomas f johnson the attorney for gunsalus estate angrily 
rebutted manninos comments 
the unspoken assumption of american tobaccos argument is 
what does it matter if we kill a bum he told the jury 
he doesnt want to make it into a product liability case and 
wants to make it into a plaintiff liability case he said

farmers insurance group inc battling a 
hostile 45 billion takeover bid by batus inc announced friday 
that it had adopted a poison pill defense 
farmers board of directors will issue shareholder rights 
entitling holders to buy additional stock in the insurance company 
at half price in the event an outsider acquires 20 percent or more 
of the companys stock also if the company were bought 
shareholders would be entitled to buy stock in the acquiring 
company 
such plans common among companies worried about takeovers are 
called poison pills because they dilute the value of the 
holdings of the buying company forcing a hostile bidder to spend 
more in order to swallow the target company 
batus a conglomerate based in louisville ky whose operations 
include the maker of kool cigarettes and retailers led by new 
yorks saks fifth avenue is offering to buy farmers stock for 63 
a share it has failed to persuade farmers management to negotiate 
a friendly merger and the companies are battling in hearings before 
insurance regulators in nine states who must approve a buyout 
batus said friday that farmers adoption of the poison pill 
defense was a desperate attempt by the board to further 
obstruct batus takeover bid 
the adoption of this poison pill is not in the best interest 
of the shareholders and policyholders since it is intended to 
retain farmers boards entrenched position the company said in 
a written statement obviously farmers board is responding in a 
selfserving manner to increasing pressure from shareholders which 
will inevitably lead to the successful completion of the 
acquisition 
the statement also said that fridays action is also a clear 
signal that farmers board does not in reality believe it will be 
successful in stopping the acquisition at the state regulatory 
level 
last week california became the first state to reject batus 
application batus challenged the decision by the california 
insurance department in los angeles superior court this week 
earlier this month batus said it had received offers to sell 
from holders of 28 percent of farmers stock 
farmers shareholders rights are to be issued july 5 and are 
valid for 10 years unless recalled by management 
if the plan is triggered each share of farmers stock would 
carry the right for its owner to pay 160 for 320 worth of farmers 
stock 
batus is a subsidiary of bat industries plc of britain

jacobs suchard ag conceded defeat on friday in the 
takeover battle for british confectioner rowntree plc to swiss 
foods giant nestle sa which now will displace jacobs suchard as 
the worlds secondlargest confectioner 
but jacobs suchard which agreed to sell its 284 percent stake 
in rowntree to nestle for 690 million pounds or 12 billion is 
walking away with a hefty profit which analysts estimate at more 
than 200 million pounds 
jacobs suchard is now expected to turn its attention to cadbury 
schweppes plc the british confectioner and soft drink company in 
which general cinema corp of the united states holds an 184 
percent stake 
on thursday rowntree the york englandbased manufacturer of 
candies such as the kit kat bar announced that its board had 
accepted a sweetened nestle offer of 255 billion pounds or 1075 
pence a share 
jacobs suchard said it would allow its own rival offer for 
rowntree of 232 billion pounds or 950 pence a share to lapse 
and nestle later confirmed it had purchased jacobs suchards entire 
stake that gives nestle about 51 percent of all rowntrees stock 
jacobs suchards decision to bow out gave control of rowntree to 
nestle ending a monthslong takeover battle which created a huge 
controversy in britain and was dubbed the candy bar wars 
critics have objected to the purchase of a 263yearold british 
company by a foreign one and have feared an acquisition would 
result in layoffs 
the merger of rowntree into nestle will create a confectioner 
that ranks only behind mars inc of the united states the worlds 
biggest confectioner jacobs suchard falls to third place 
zurichbased jacobs suchard which has interests in chocolate 
and coffee said it agreed to sell to nestle its 642 million 
rowntree shares at nestles offer price 
jacobs suchard said the increased nestle offer was higher than 
the maximum price it could afford 
nestle based in vevey switzerland had raised its offer 21 
percent from 21 billion pounds or 890 pence a share and 13 
percent above jacobs suchards offer 
the rowntree takeover battle began april 13 when jacobs suchard 
which makes the toblerone chocolate bar snapped up nearly 15 
percent of rowntrees shares in a dawn raid 
that move prompted nestle to jump in with its original offer 
april 26 suchard countered with its bid a month later 
analysts speculated jacobs suchard will try to reach a friendly 
agreement with cadbury schweppes or will try to split up the 
company with general cinema taking the confectionery business for 
itself and leaving the soft drink operations with the usbased 
company 
general cinema whose headquarters are in chestnut hill 
massachusetts has interests in movie theaters soft drink bottling 
and retailing 
cadbury is the last one thats publicly available if you want 
to be among the top three world confectionery companies said 
michael landymore a food companies analyst with the london 
investment firm henderson crosthwaite ltd 
richard allan a food companies analyst with kleinwort grieveson 
securities ltd said cadbury is the most obvious alternative 
its the only apparent major play in the chocolate confectionery 
business left with suchard 
analysts said jacobs suchards other alternatives are to acquire 
small independent producers piecemeal spend a lot of money 
developing business in the far east where it sees the biggest 
opportunities in the long term or it could decide to develop in a 
totally different direction

the stock market retreated friday in moderate 
trading apparently discounting the beneficial effects of a 
stronger dollar and eased interest rates in the credit markets 
some traders said they werent surprised that investors would 
cash gains made earlier in the week when the dow jones industrial 
average hit a postcrash high on the dollars resurging value 
as far as the stock market is concerned you might get a 
breather in here said gerald rivlin executive vice president at 
rodman amp renshaw inc in chicago 
but others who had thought the dollar move possibly signaled the 
start of a sustained upward move in stock prices were disappointed 
some said talk had resurfaced that the dollars new strength 
instead of helping stocks by easing inflation and attracting 
foreign buyers could prove harmful by blunting the improvement in 
the nations trade deficit 
anytime the market makes a good run somebody comes out with 
something on the negative said philip c puccio senior vice 
president and manager of institutional trading at dillon read amp co 
in new york people should stop thinking about the short term and

africans have cautiously hailed the 
decision by the worlds seven richest nations to ease the 
continents massive debt burden but theyre not expecting it to 
solve their economic woes 
we have reservations about the blueprint on africas debt 
the times of zambia said in a typical african editorial reaction to 
the toronto economic summit that ended tuesday 
but there can be no doubt that it was the most significant in 
the series particularly for africa 
the continents leaders have refrained from commenting publicly 
about the 14th economic summit of the united states britain 
canada france italy japan and west germany evidently wanting 
time to assess the implications of the final communique 
in it the industrialized powers pledged to do more to lift the 
crippling debt burdens of the poorest nations particularly in 
africa but made no new initiative to help latin american debtors 
the leaders who gathered for three days in toronto backed a plan 
offering a variety of options that will benefit most subsaharan 
countries such as lowering interest rates and scrapping some loan 
repayments 
but those measures fall far short of persistent african pleas to 
western creditors to write off most of their 200 billion in debts 
and reschedule others at a time when servicing saps most of their 
export income 
french president francois mitterrand had appealed to summit 
leaders to follow his governments example of cancelling a third of 
all debts owed by subsaharan nations 
on the eve of the toronto talks former tanzanian president 
julius nyerere reflected most african leaders repeated appeals 
when he told reporters in rome it is not possible for a minority 
of northerners to control the wealth of the world and hope to live 
in peace sooner or later it the debt crisis is going to 
explode 
nyerere chairman of the south commission set up in 1986 to 
promote economic cooperation between third world countries urged 
the rich nations to defuse a poverty bomb by writing off all 
debts 
leaders like nyerere argue that they have been virtually 
bankrupted by foreignfixed low prices for their exports and high 
costs of imports particularly oil but they resist some calls to 
arbitrarily cancel the debts fearing they will be denied future 
credits and trade 
some western economists also cite natural calamities like 
drought and famine and manmade tragedies such as civil war 
rampant corruption and government mismanagement for africas 
economic ills 
but all agree that most of the continents 550 million people 
suffer from lack of development and limited spending on schooling 
health and housing 
the toronto plan for the poor nations calls for creditor 
countries to reschedule official debts according to the final 
communique 
but it did not hold the seven powers to any particular pledges 
offering them instead options including reduced interest rates on 
shortterm loans extended repayment periods at higher interest 
rates partial cancellation of loans or a combination of all those 
measures 
it marked the end of the disturbing silence which those 
countries that africa owes money had long maintained on the debt 
issue the ruling partyowned times of zambia noted in its 
editorial

maximum production quotas on steel companies for the past eight 
years

eec industry ministers decided to lift by july 1 the quotas applied 
to four products coils coldrolled sheets heavy plates and heavy 
sections 
quotas will remain on heavysection steel

the dollar continued its upward surge friday 
piercing key psychological resistance points to reach levels 
against many major currencies not seen in eight months 
gold prices fell republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid price of 443 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt down 
sharply from 44790 late thursday 
traders said activity was hectic particularly following a 
report that quoted an unnamed us official as saying the dollar 
could rise as high as 138 japanese yen before diminishing the 
competitiveness of the nations exports 
the report said a 5 percent increase in the dollar would not 
be that big a deal and we traded right up to that point said 
stephen flanagan an assistant vice president at manufacturers 
hanover trust co 
while the dollar gyrated up and down flanagan said the 
currencys basic upward direction is being sparked by some very 
large buying 
he said the dollar is seeing good investor demand from 
japan where investors are attracted by relatively higher us 
interest rates as well as strong recent rallies in the stock and 
bond markets 
still some analysts remained puzzled by the dollars strong 
showing 
from an economic point of view theres really not all that 
much fundamentally to support the dollar said jack barbanel a 
senior vice president at gruntal amp co 
he noted however that a commerce department report that 
personal income rose a modest 03 percent in may supported the 
contention that inflation is in check 
traders shrugged off rumors of central bank intervention to stem 
the dollars advance and the currency pushed beyond the sharp 
gains it posted earlier friday in european trading 
overseas active buying by us banks helped push the dollar 
past the psychologically important barrier of 180 west german 
marks late in european trading despite midday dollar sales by the 
west german central bank 
people were expecting a downward correction and when it 
didnt materialize the dollar went higher said robert bauer a 
senior dealer at commerzbank ag in frankfurt west germany 
in tokyo where the business day ends before europes begins 
the dollar rose 115 japanese yen to a closing 12970 yen later in 
london it was quoted at a higher rate of 13005 yen in new york

the droughtdriven rally in most grain and soybean futures 
markets stalled friday as scattered showers forced skittish traders 
to pause for a look at reality analysts said 
prices yoyoed on the chicago board of trade but finished mixed 
with only oat futures continuing the sharply higher trend 
established earlier in the week 
on other exchanges precious metals futures fell sharply 
livestock and meat futures were mixed energy futures slipped and 
stockindex futures retreated 
this thing has more lives than a cat it kept coming back and 
coming back victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc said of the grain markets erratic performance 
reports of scattered showers in the farm belt and expectations 
for more rain dampened the buying enthusiam that has driven grain 
and soybean futures prices up sharply this month but the markets 
resilience suggested prices could skyrocket again next week if the 
weekend is dry and meteorologists continue to foresee drought 
conditions analysts said 
soybeans opened lower climbed higher fell sharply then came 
back to settle mixed for the session but substantially below the 
15year high of 1099 a bushel reached thursday corn futures 
followed a similar path 
its a particularly sensitive time right now as far as the 
market is concerned said ted mao grain specialist with shearson 
lehman hutton inc in chicago 
the crop is still under stress but traders are trying to 
answer the question has this recent runup in price discounted a 
lot of the potential damage or is there a lot more discounting that 
has to take place and that will be answered early next week 
wheat finished slightly higher and 1988 oat futures which 
reached record highs earlier this week soared their daily limit 
for the fifth consecutive session on reports of severe 
irreversible crop damage 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to 6 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in july at 380 a bushel corn was 5 cents lower to 
2 cents higher with july at 342 a bushel oats were 6 cents 
lower to 15 cents higher with july at 363 a bushel soybeans were 
10 cents lower to 10 cents higher with july at 1029 a bushel 
precious metals futures fell sharply on new yorks commodity 
exchange in response to the dollars strong gains against other 
currencies 
a stronger dollar is perceived as reducing the potential for 
inflation analysts said a variety of government reports issued 
this week indicating only modest growth in the economy also helped 
cool inflation fears 
precious metals which are perceived as an investment hedge 
against inflation tend to rise and fall with inflationary 
expectations 
the markets are feeling that maybe the economy is nt 
overheating and thats helped to reduce concerns about inflation 
said craig sloane a metals analyst with smith barney harris upham 
amp co in new york 
gold settled 470 to 660 lower with august at 446 a troy 
ounce silver was 175 cents to 181 cents lower with july at 681 
a troy ounce 
copper was 155 cents to 460 cents lower with july at 1045 a 
pound 
cattle futures advanced hogs were mixed and frozen pork bellies 
continued their steep slide on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the steadying grain futures boosted cattle futures on ideas that 
feed prices may not rise high enough to force as much herdthinning 
as had been feared said thomas morgan president of sterling 
research corp in arlington heights ill 
the grain markets also supported hog futures but not enough to 
overcome the bearish implications of wednesdays agriculture 
department report showing large supplies of pork and poultry in 
cold storage morgan said 
live cattle were 10 cent to 65 cent higher with august at 
6277 cents a pound feeder cattle were 45 cent to 108 cents 
higher with august at 7085 cents a pound hogs were 95 cent lower

bellies falling the 2cent limit for the third straight day were

rally in the gasoline pit at the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents to 36 cents 
lower with august at 1601 a barrel heating oil was 77 cent to

continental airlines said friday it expected to 
report a secondquarter loss because of a 131 million upward 
revision in estimated expenses for foreign currency fluctuations 
and passenger scheduling foulups 
continental said in a statement that the revised estimate would 
be identified separately in the secondquarter earnings report of 
its parent firm texas air corp 
the houstonbased airline said its estimates for categories such 
as ticketing errors and currency fluctuations were short by 67 
million while estimates for reaccommodation costs for transporting 
ticketholders on other airlines was off by 64 million 
these accounts are really unearned revenue spokesman bruce 
hicks said when we collect for tickets until flights are flown 
it is unearned revenue and an air traffic liability 
the number always is an estimate we noticed a decline in that 
account very recently and did a thorough review and in last few 
days determined the magnitude of this 
the airline said that like other carriers it conducts an annual 
verification of such accounts but made the review earlier than 
normal because the accounts had been declining in recent months 
hicks said the changes in estimates would have no impact on 
current or future cash levels of continental and that the airline 
expects to be profitable for the last half of 1988

of kansas city a privately owned payless competitor that operates 
about 86 building materials stores in midwest and southern states

shares 
perry sutherland an executive in sutherland lumber said the 
group was still interested in acquiring payless 
the payless management group said it has received commitments to

a floating general store and fuel depot 
that ferries supplies to passing towboats has seen business dry up 
as the worst drought in 50 years has sporadically halted barge 
traffic on the shrinking mississippi river 
the boats are just sitting out there the diesel fuel sales 
have all but come to a halt things have come to a standstill 
said robert luttrell executive vice president of waterways marine 
inc he estimated the shutdown has caused a 30 percent to 40 
percent drop in business 
weve never seen anything like this were working on unplowed 
ground luttrell said 
the mighty mississippi is at an alltime low since records were 
first kept in 1872 it was closed to commercial traffic from 
tuesday evening until friday because the channel about six miles 
north of memphis was six inches shy of the 9foot depth needed to 
allow towboats and their barges to pass 
a 35footwide dredge was sent in to clear the channel and 
until it finished 56 towboats and their barges were parked along a 
40mile stretch of river around memphis the river has fallen so 
low some boats had trouble finding trees near enough to the water 
for anchor lines 
we should have all the backup cleared out of here by midday 
sunday coast guard cmdr michael donohoe said after the oneway 
channel was reopened for southbound traffic first 
when traffic was at a standstill waterways marine was ferrying 
groceries drinking water newspapers and mail to the idled boats 
its a mess said general manager david cummings an 
exriver pilot whose first job was on a steampowered sidewheeled 
paddleboatthe problem here is theres no relief in sight as far 
as the rain forecasts go this is a crisis 
in normal times 30 to 50 towboats churn past memphis daily 
pushing barges loaded with wheat corn fertilizer coal steel 
gas jet fuel oil chemicals cement auto parts and other bulk 
goods 
it would take 27000 trucks to haul a days cargo on the 
mississippi which is like a natural interstate highway that serves 
as a lifeline to the nation 
some of the larger towboats cost 1000 an hour to run so they 
lose money if they stop they like to refuel and restock supplies 
on the run 
waterways marine can deliver more than 5000 items all a boat 
has to do is radio in orders for steaks potatoes coffee flour 
sugar ice cream watermelons milk and all types of hardware 
i cant remember it being this dry for this long i cant 
remember the river being closed this long said cummings weve 
just got to live with it if thats what the lord wants and pray for 
rain 
tommy pinion 38 of lambert miss pilots fuel boats for the 
depot 
ive never seen the water so low that the boats cant get 
through pinion said its going to hurt a lot of people if the 
companies have to start laying people off 
the whole river industry will be hurt

more than 1800 workers at general 
electric corps plant here may be headed to the picket line if 
their unions local and national negotiators dont reach a contract 
settlement soon 
representatives of the company and the dozen labor unions which 
represent ges 67000 union employees have been meeting in new york 
since june 17 trying to negotiate a national contract the current 
contract expires at midnight sunday 
a bargaining team from the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers local 2249 has been trying to negotiate a local 
contract for workers but those negotiations have been postponed 
until next week because the unions president is involved in 
national negotations in new york 
most of ges unionized workers are covered by the national 
contract however the electrical workers union operates 
independently which means that salary and benefits settlements are 
based on those reached in national negotiations but are not 
formally bound by national contracts work rules and other local 
issues are negotiated separately as part of the local contract 
a telephone taped message for unionized ge employees from the 
national negotiating committee friday said negotiations were 
stalemated and urged workers to prepare for a possible strike 
so far bargaining progress is nonexistent the recording 
said there is a real possibility we will be forced to strike 
members are urged to prepare for a job action and make sure 
management knows you are militant 
however a clause in the existing contract requires the union to 
give the company 10 days notice before calling a strike ge 
bloomington manager of employee relations mike horrigan said the 
electrical workers local is not technically required to follow the 
terms of the national contract but has always done so 
ge officials at company headquarters in fairfield conn 
believe that the differences between the company and the unions can 
be resolved 
there are still differences to resolve but we believe that 
both parties will make every effort to work out agreement said 
jack batty a ge spokesman 
we still have two days to go and well be negotiating right 
up to the deadline were still very hopeful that there will be a 
satisfactory settlement he said 
were working toward a sunday deadline and the two sides are 
meeting continuouslysaid jerry borstel a spokesman for the iue 
and the joint union bargaining committee we dont know at this 
point whats going to happen but we do expect to get an offer from 
ge on sunday 
its important that our members not assume that this thing is 
going to be easy or anything like that he said 
borstel said job security has been a major issue in the national 
negotiations because of a large number of layoffs cutbacks and 
plant shutdowns during the past few years he said the union also 
hopes to win a substantial wage increase for workers
