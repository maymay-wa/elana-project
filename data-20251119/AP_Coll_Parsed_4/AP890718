a laser reflection experiment that scientists 
compared to using a rifle to hit a moving dime two miles away is the 
only instrument on the moon from the apollo program still working 
nasa officials said tuesday 
the device called a laser ranging retroreflector is used 
regularly to reflect laser beamss aimed at it from earth said 
officials at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
one was set in the lunar dust in the sea of tranquility 20 years 
ago by astronauts neil a armstrong and edwin e buzz aldrin 
jr the national aeronautics and space administration said 
one of the reasons why its still being used is because theres 
no energy required on the moon for it to be used said jean 
dickey supervisor of the space geodetic science and applications 
group at the laboratory 
similar reflectors were left elsewhere on the moon by apollo 14 
and apollo 15 and by lunakhod 2 an unmanned soviet lander and all 
four still are used by three ground stations on earth dickey said 
its the only experiment from the apollo program that is still 
working she said 
a solarpowered instrument package also was left on the moon to 
transmit data back to earth by apollo 11 and each of the five 
successful lunar landings placed nuclearpowered instrument stations 
on the moon 
but all were shut down during the mid1970s as budget cuts made 
it impossible to continue processing data transmitted from the moon 
said charles redmond a nasa spokesman in washington 
the laser ranging retroreflector is the moving dime in 
scientists rifleshooting analogy and was designed to reflect 
laser pulses fired from the mcdonald observatory in fort davis 
texas the idea was to measure the roundtrip travel time of a pulse 
of light from the earth to the moon and back 
the information can be used to calculate distances with 
unprecedented accuracy not only from the earth to the moon but 
between particular observatories on earth dickey said 
when you think that we can measure the distance from the earth 
to the moon to within three centimeters about an inch its really 
pretty incredible dickey said 
among other things experiments have shown that the moon is 
gradually pulling away from the earth at about 1 inches a year 
scientists using the lunar reflectors also have measured how the 
earths continental plates are slowly drifting they found that the 
atmosphere tides and earths core cause variations in the length of 
a day varying by about onethousandth of a second over a year 
theres been a tremendous growth in our accuracy dickey 
said twenty years ago the original ranges were with an accuracy 
of meters 
improvements in accuracy were made possible primarily by the 
placement of additional reflectors on the moon and of two 
additional observatories in hawaii and france dickey said 
the reflectors are too small to be seen from earth so even when 
the laser is correctly aligned on earth it is a challenge to 
actually hit the lunar target laboratory officials said 
the amount of light reflected back to earth is very small dickey 
said and usually is measured in photons the fundamental unit of 
light

the kirov ballet combined the beautiful la 
bayadere third act with a paean to its revolution battleship 
potemkin at the metropolitan opera on tuesday night 
altynai asylmuratova 28 the ballerina most admired during the 
current kirov ballet engagement danced the leading role opposite 
konstantin zaklinsky who is her husband in la bayadere 
there is a story to this marius petipa ballet but seeing the 
third act alone one doesnt need to know it and dancers dont need 
to act characters the corps de ballet enters one at a time and 
this corps de ballet is unsurpassed for timing and sweetness miss 
asylmuratova didnt surpass memories of dame margot fonteyn dancing 
the same thing but she too made this section of la bayadere 
magical 
three ballerinas irina chistyakova yelena pankova and zhanna 
ayupova who danced variations all were wonderful 
battleship potemkin was choreographed some four years ago by 
the companys artistic director oleg vinogradov to a score 
composed for it by aleksandr tchaikovsky americans would consider 
potemkin a novelty but its obvious from its hourplus length 
and many elaborate backdrops that its intended to be more than 
that americans probably also wouldnt want to see potemkin more 
than once some of it is decidedly odd 
the choreographic technique is to use modern dance not following 
the rules of ballet but making the turns and steps extremely 
balletic especially for solos by vladimir bondarenko and andrei 
garbuz as sailors ships officers kick a sailor to death then 
another death gennadi babanin has a long athletic duet with each 
the ships commander yuri gumba hops with both feet together 
and has other steps which portray him as a childish madman the tzar 
and tzarina come on board moving stiffly like puppets she dances 
as though imitating the can can the choreography makes the 
oppressors look silly but it isnt very interesting as dance 
finally the sailors band together face officers with guns who 
run away kick the commander toss their shirts in the air cavort 
with joy and run down an aisle 
the artistic image to hold from this program is la bayadere

all children in the united states especially 
those entering middle school or junior high school should be given 
a second vaccination against measles the american academy of 
pediatrics said 
the shot would be in addition to one that all children are 
supposed to receive when they are about 15 months old according to 
the academy headquartered in suburban elk grove village 
the warning issued by the academy monday comes with doctors 
fearing that measles infections in 1989 could be worse than in any 
of the past nine years 
many children are contracting the disease even though they were 
vaccinated as infants dr scott giebink of the university of 
minnesota said monday giebink is a member of the academys 
committee on infectious diseases 
the centers for disease control in atlanta has counted 7563 
measles cases throughout the nation this year up to july 9 a 376 
percent increase over the 1586 cases reported during the comparable 
period last year 
john mullen of the cdc said there are 30 outbreaks or clusters 
of measles cases in 19 states 
the majority of new cases are in children and young people from 
kindergarten through college giebink said 
about 60 percent were in children already vaccinated he said 
as a result the academy and the us public health service 
both now recommend two doses of the vaccine for all children in the 
united states he said

here are highlights of events on the 
apollo 11 moon flight 20 years ago today 
as apollo 11 coasted smoothly toward the moon astronauts neil 
armstrong and buzz aldrin left mike collins alone in the command 
module columbia and crawled through a connecting tunnel to enter the 
lunar module eagle with earthlings watching on television 
armstrong and aldrin inspected the craft and checked switch settings 
to make certain nothing had been disturbed or damaged by buffeting 
at the time of launch they reported the lunar ship was in good 
shape 
at 1132 pm edt the astronauts passed through an area called 
the equigravisphere a twilight zone in which the gravitational 
influence of the earth and moon is about equal once through this 
zone the moon won the gravitational tugofwar and apollo 11 was in 
the grip of lunar gravity the ship passed through this invisible 
barrier when it was 43495 miles from the moon and 214402 miles 
from earth

a new genetic discovery may help the search for 
treatments for retinitis pigmentosa a disease of blindness that 
afflicts some 100000 americans researchers say 
scientists reported monday they had located a gene that causes 
one form of the inherited disease a step toward isolating and 
analyzing the gene 
that analysis in turn could give leads for finding genes that 
cause other forms of the disease said researcher peter humphries 
and finding out what the genes do may give researchers ideas for 
treatment he said 
retinitis pigmentosa called rp progresses from night blindness 
to tunnel vision to blindness symptoms are caused by degeneration 
in the retina a delicate layer of cells at the back of the eye that 
detect images and relay them to the brain 
rp comes in several forms about 20 percent of cases are caused 
by the autosomal dominant form in which each child has a 50 
percent chance of inheriting the disease from an affected parent 
the gene in the new study may cause about half the autosomal 
dominant cases of rp said study coauthor stephen daiger professor 
of medical genetics at the university of texas health science center 
in houston 
other scientists located the gene for another form of rp several 
years ago but they have not yet been able to isolate it daiger 
said 
he and humphries who is lecturer in medical genetics at trinity 
college in dublin ireland discussed the discovery at a news 
conference sponsored by the baltimorebased rp foundation fighting 
blindness the organization supported the research 
the work is the first big step to isolating and analyzing the 
gene said gerald chader director of intramural research at the 
national eye institute in a telephone interview 
genes lie on tiny threadlike structures called chromosomes some 
genes cause disease when they fail to work correctly 
to locate particular genes scientists begin with socalled 
chemical markers on the genes these markers which can be 
easily recognized in the laboratory can be used to trace patterns 
of inheritance when researchers find families with markers close to 
a gene of interest they can move toward isolation of the gene 
itself 
the new work revealed a marker that appears to lie very very 
close indeed to the rp gene on the chromosome scientists designate 
number 3 humphries said 
humphries and colleagues studied a family near dublin that has 
100 living members of whom half have rp the work involved 
comparing genetic material from affected and unaffected family 
members 
it may take several years to isolate the gene daiger said 
daiger said tentative data from his lab suggest that the gene 
found in the irish family is not responsible for the disease in an 
american family he is studying 
that is not surprising since the two families have different 
kinds of autosomal dominant rp he said the irish family shows an 
earlyonset form in which night blindness can be apparent as early 
as age 1 while the american family shows a lateonset form in 
which night blindness may not appear until age 20 or later 
the work on the irish family is to be published in the october 
issue of the journal genomics the rp foundation said

the government insisted monday that 
gen manuel antonio noriega would not step down as panamas de facto 
leader complicating talks with the opposition on resolving the 
nations political crisis 
earlier government representatives had said they were willing to 
listen to a proposal for noriegas departure the negotiations began 
sunday under sponsorship of the organization of american states 
the discussions mark the first time since the annulled may 7 
elections that the opposition has met with representatives of 
noriega progovernment parties and the executive branch 
despite disagreements the groups agreed on an agenda in the talks 
mediated by oas diplomats 
a government representative said negotiations will resume when 
the opposition delegates return from an oas meeting wednesday in 
washington 
the items listed on the agenda by the opposition include the 
removal of noriega as chief of panamas defense forces defining 
what is meant by transfer of power the elections that international 
observers said the opposition won by a 31 margin and human rights 
violations 
government and military representatives listed as their agenda 
items an end to what they called us agression and military threats 
against panama withdrawal of additional us troops sent to panama 
the return of panamanian funds being held by the united states 
strict compliance with the 1977 panama canal treaties that provide 
for panama to gain full control over the canal at the end of 1999 
and no us interference in panamas political affairs 
the main differences are over fundamental issues said 
ricardo arias calderon during a break in the second day of talks 
calderon was an opposition vice presidential candidate in the may 
vote 
carlos duque the government party candidate said during the 
break noriega is not negotiable 
before the session began duque said government representatives 
would consider noriegas departure but they also want two us 
generals to leave and us sanctions to end 
we will bring the evidence to defend noriegas case duque 
said they can bring it up as we could bring up the departure of 
gen marc cisneros and gen fred woerner and an end to the us 
economic aggressions and the withdrawal of the additional us 
troops sent to panama 
woerner heads the southern command which includes all us 
military installations in panama cisneros is commander of army 
troops charged with the defense of the canal 
cisneros often is criticized locally for his antinoriega 
statements and the military maneuvers and exercises his forces 
conduct 
the opposition had refused to take part in talks unless 
representatives of the military also took part noriegas position 
was that the problem was one for politicians to solve and that he 
would remain as head of the defense forces come what may 
the us government also is opposed to noriega whom it has 
indicted on drugrelated charges and accused of domestic repression 
the united states has imposed economic sanctions on panama to force 
noriegas ouster and has increased its military forces for 
protection of the panama canal 
the meeting was arranged by an oas mission led by foreign 
minister diego cordovez of ecuador other members of the mission are 
oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares of brazil guatemalan 
foreign minister mario palencia and sahadeo basdeo foreign 
minister of trinidad and tobago 
the group said it would leave for washington on tuesday to submit 
a report to the organization the following day 
while mondays meeting was in progress noriega attended a 
session of the state council which is studying a proposal for 
forming a junta after sept 1 when the current governments term 
ends 
as he left the meeting noriega was asked about the countrys 
political situation he said nothing but reached into the seat of 
his car and smiling took out a police club and waved it at 
journalists

interim results from a study of an experimental 
alzheimers disease drug called tha are promising enough to keep the 
study going the projects chief investigator says 
researchers analyzed results from the first 100 patients to 
complete the project said kenneth davis 
the study could have been stopped if interim results demonstrated 
that tha was either worthless or highly effective 
davis said that under the rules of the study he could not 
release details from the interim analysis but he said it was 
encouraging enough to warrant continuation of the study 
researchers hope 300 patients will eventually complete the study 
final results may be available in a little more than a year davis 
said monday 
davis is professor and chairman of psychiatry at the mount sinai 
medical center in new york and principal investigator of the tha 
study which involves 16 institutions 
the project sponsored by the national institute on aging the 
alzheimers association and the warnerlambert co follows up on a 
1986 study that suggested the drug may ease some symptoms in some 
patients 
alzheimers disease is a progressive degenerative illness that 
impairs memory thinking and behavior an estimated 25 million 
americans are afflicted 
tha or tetrahydroaminoacridine is also called tacrine 
about 340 patients have entered an initial phase of the study so 
far but only 40 percent have proven eligible to continue into the 
main portion of the project davis said 
about 15 percent of the original group had to drop out because 
they showed signs of potential liver damage from the drug he said 
the balance of the dropouts were removed because tha created no 
significant improvement in their alzheimers symptoms in the initial 
phase of the study he said

almost every day the sound of rocket 
and artillery fire echoes through the capital a reminder that the 
moslem guerrillas are close 
it sounds like thunder but when you look at the sky and there 
are no clouds you know what it is said iqbal akhmed 
and you know theyre out there just waiting the 38yearold 
antiques dealer said pointing at the mountains 
the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors are hiding in the 
mountains about 10 miles away just beyond the ridges that ring this 
city of 225 million people 
since the final pullout of soviet troops on feb 15 the 
guerrillas have been saying a fullscale attack on kabul is 
imminent but if they carry through with their threat they will 
face powerful air and land defenses capable of resisting a 
substantial offensive 
in a military emergency the government can put 200000 armed men 
and women into battle against the guerrillas this includes the 
elite 16000man presidential guard and 20000 armed civilians 
fiercely loyal to the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
i can assure that kabul is welldefended said the mayor 
gen mohammad hakim this is no hollow claim 
rebel commanders in the frontier city of peshawar pakistan say 
they are mobilizing 20000 fighters and readying them for action 
ussupplied weapons are loaded on colorfully painted trucks 
captured soviet jeeps or donkeys and hauled from pakistan on narrow 
dirt roads that crisscross the rebelcontrolled countryside and over 
mountains toward kabul 
some pressure has got to be brought on the government said 
mohammad ishaq a peshawarbased spokesman for hezbeislami 
believed to be the strongest of the guerrilla groups around kabul 
but guerrilla leaders and field commanders appear divided about 
their strategy fearing a repeat of the march offensive on the 
provincial capital of jalalabad about 75 miles east of kabul 
the countrys fifthlargest city jalalabad was the guerrillas 
first major target after the soviet troops left afghanistan the 
insurgents had predicted the city would fall within three days but 
they have so far failed in their assault on president najibs 
wellequipped and dugin forces 
in kabul the mujahedeen want to go stepbystep and not face 
the problems they faced in jalalabad said mohammad shoaib a 
peshawarbased spokeman for the jamiateislami rebel group 
foreign military experts in kabul say any attack on the capital 
would require a major effort in manpower and fire support as well as 
a unified command structure and coordination by the already divided 
guerrilla alliance 
we do not think that the rebels have such capabilities at 
least they have not shown that they possess such capability in the 
battle for jalalabad said an asian defense expert speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the only option before the mujahedeen is to carry out 
largescale sabotage and create a fear psychosis and then during the 
confusion aim to launch a physical attack he said 
the afghan army has divided kabul into three sectors the 
northern district is defended by regular army units the eastern 
district is under the command of the sarandoy or state police 
the western and southern districts which have been linked as one 
security zone are under the afghan secret police known as khad 
while the hills that surround kabul provide cover for the 
guerrillas they also are a strategic advantage for the government 
defense posts dotting the hills can detect advancing rebel groups 
and pound them with artillery fire 
the army also has 122mm rockets to bombard rebelheld points and 
converted sovietmade transport planes that can drop bombs from well 
above the range of the rebels americanmade stinger antiaircraft 
missiles 
although the soviet troops are gone the kremlin still sends 
dozens of giant military transport planes to kabul every day with 
weapons and ammunition 
the rebels refuse to be tied to deadlines but say they wont wait 
until next year to launch an attack 
were not willing to postpone it that long but it is hard to 
predict from day to day it takes time said abdul haidi 
arghandehwal a spokesman for fundamentalist guerrilla leader 
gulbaddin hekmatyar 
arghandehwal said the guerrillas plan to concentrate on the 
perimeter defense posts and roads around kabul and will try to 
infiltrate into the city mobilizing the people and generating mass 
protests to undermine najibs government

its life in the fast lane for a road 
crew given 24 days to complete a repaving project that usually would 
take more than three months 
about 75 workers hopped on bulldozers monday along the sevenmile 
stretch of interstate 96 west of grand rapids after state department 
of transportation officials fired a starting pistol and waved an 
orange construction flag dot spokeswoman janet foren said 
they really started moving when that gun went off foren said 
cold cash might have accounted for the hot start 
the state will pay the chief contractor thompsonmccully co of 
belleville 500 for each hour by which the company beats the 24day 
or 576hour deadline but if the company misses the deadline it 
will be fined 500 for each additional hour needed foren said 
road crews will work from 6 am until 10 pm six or seven days 
a week to complete the 14 million project foren said they 
usually work from about 7 am to 330 pm five days a week 
motorists can monitor the progress of the project by watching two 
huge clocks at either end of the construction site that will count 
down the 24 days 
foren said the clock will stop only when it rains 
unlike baseball however no full rain days will be allowed 
when the raindrops stop the clock starts ticking

president joaquim chissano said monday 
his country is weary of war and said he authorized church leaders to 
present government peace proposals to guerrillas 
chisano said the church officials and a government delegation 
were in nairobi for talks with guerrilla leaders on wednesday in 
portugal a rebel spokesman said the guerrilla delegation would 
consider the government proposals 
it was not immediately clear what the government proposals would 
include 
an estimated 100000 people have died in the 12yearold civil 
war that broke out after mozambique gained independence from 
portugal about 16 million mozambicans are refugees and half the 
countrys 147 million people depend at least partially on food 
aid 
chissano who in the past has rejected negotiations with the 
mozambique national resistance guerrillas said monday he decided to 
negotiate because of the sentiments of the population vis a vis 
the war 
he said that although the mozambican people repudiated the 
guerrillas acts of violence they also had a great desire for 
the end of the war 
chissano said he asked catholic and protestant members of the 
19church mozambican christian council to meet with a guerrilla 
delegation in nairobi kenya to find out what they want the 
government news agency aim reported 
aim quoted chissano as saying the government will not inist that 
the guerrillas lay down their arms but that they end all acts of 
terrorism and banditry 
chissano said a mozambican government delegation consisting of 
provincial leaders was also in nairobi to clarify the governments 
position for the kenyan government or the church delegation 
renamo began its guerrilla war against the marxist government in 
1977 with rhodesian help and was then aided by south africa from 
198084 until south africa signed a nonaggression pact with 
mozambique 
the mozambican government continued to accuse south africa of 
violating the agreement but relations have improved recently and 
the mozambican government now says support for the guerrillas still 
comes from south africa but it does not say who is behind it 
renamo which has been accused of mutilating peasants enslaving 
children burning villages and crops and attacking food relief 
convoys is not openly supported by any government but it maintains 
offices in the united states and portugal

gov henry bellmon unveiled a plan monday to 
do away with property taxes and substitute a system of income tax 
surcharges and new levies on most goods and services 
the governor said the plan designed to increase financing for 
public schools could generate 245 million in new revenue beginning 
in 1991 amounting to about 8 percent of the state budget 
teachers would get most of this new money bellmon said 
noting it could mean average raises of up to 6000 per teacher 
the republican governor met privately with legislative leaders to 
discuss the plan which bellmon said he wants the legislature to 
pass in a special session he has called to begin aug 14 
teachers union officials praised the plan but some legislators 
expressed reservations about the possibility of passing the 
funding equity and equal educational opportunity act in the 
special session 
bellmon said the plan addresses public school funding and teacher 
pay areas in which oklahoma has lagged far behind the national 
average 
we believe that once the plan is understood there will be 
widespread support bellmon said once the plan is fully 
implemented oklahoma will be among the leaders in educational 
excellence 
the state ranks 48th nationally in teacher salaries with an 
average of approximately 22000 a year according to the oklahoma 
education association 
the tax program overhauls the method of financing schools and 
county government by replacing the local property tax with a 15 
percent income tax surcharge and a new 2 percent school tax on 
goods and services 
the 2 percent school tax would be levied on value received 
from the sale or lease of finished goods and services it would be 
in addition to the current 4 percent state sales tax 
groceries on which the sales tax is now levied and prescription 
drugs would be exempted the sales tax exemption would be removed 
from the value of professional services such as those provided by 
doctors dentists attorneys accountants plumbers barbers 
beauticians and mechanics 
the income tax surcharge would be assessed as a percentage of 
personal and corporate income taxes paid that money would be used 
to fund county government that now depends on property taxes 
the plan abolishes property taxes on homes farms and other 
personal property a property tax would remain for commercial 
property valued at more than 100000 and on utility company 
property 
local property taxes now produce more than 800 million for 
schools and county government 
bellmon said his proposal is designed to solve a whole series 
of problems related to education 
kyle dahlem president of the oklahoma education association was 
smiling broadly after bellmon unveiled the plan 
i am optimistic ms dahlem said i must be optimistic we 
cannot afford to go another year or two or three without a 
longrange plan 
some legislators expressed caution 
its quite the most comprehensive change ive been associated 
with since ive been in the legislature said democratic sen bob

merit i hope it does

courtroom spectators cheered monday as a 
judge upheld an antiloitering ordinance designed to rid streets of 
drug dealers 
the 4monthold city ordinance was challenged by attorneys for 
four men arrested under the law and by the southwest michigan 
chapter of the american civil liberties union they argued that the 
law violated the constitutional right of freedom of association 
district judge quinn benson ruled the city had a compelling 
interest to stem the flow of drugs which outweighed any potential 
infringement on the right of people to associate with drug dealers 
city attorney robert cinabro and lawyers representing four 
neighborhood groups argued that without the ordinance the rights of 
residents to lead peaceful safe lives would be violated 
aclu attorney robert travis argued that if the ordinance was not 
overturned then it should be amended to allow the arrest only of a 
person having intent to use or sell drugs 
the aclu said it had not decided whether to appeal bensons 
ruling 
under the law those who knowingly loiter in places where drugs 
are used or sold may be arrested 
bensons ruling was cheered by mattie jordan executive director 
of the northside association for community development this is 
going to clean our streets up she said at least the police are 
left a tool to fight the war 
city police have made 33 arrests since may said capt scott 
dolfman of the departments special investigations unit 
weve allowed citizens of the area freedom of movement in their 
neighborhoods again dolfman said 
although other cities around the country have similar laws the 
only similar ordinance in michigan is in detroit

hurricane dalilia swirled toward hawaii on monday 
on a course that would take it 150 miles south of the states 
southernmost island meteorologists said 
anything can happen the way it looks now we may get a little 
from it but not much said edmund manning of the central pacific 
hurricane center here but then you cant be too optimistic 
at 2 pm hst monday the hurricane was 630 miles eastsoutheast 
of hawaii island southernmost in the chain moving west at 20 mph 
manning said its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 mph a storm 
is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph wind 
gusted up to 90 mph 
at that speed and course the hurricane was expected to pass 
south of hawaii island the big island on tuesday night 
however the center said a slight change in direction would bring 
the hurricane closer to the state 
a tropical storm watch was issued for the island at 5 pm hst 
which means winds up to 73 mph large waves and heavy rains might 
hit the island the center said 
an air force reconaissance plane from keesler air force base in 
biloxi miss was scheduled to fly through the storm tuesday to 
collect data on its intensity and direction said clarence lee head 
of the hurricane center 
the last major storm to hit hawaii was hurricane iwa which 
brushed the island of oahu and roared over the top of kauai with 
winds up to 117 mph in november 1982 causing 234 million damage 
manning said it was too early to predict with certainty how 
dalilia would affect hawaiis weather 
a lot depends on how close dalilia moves to the islands he 
said some increase in showers and winds will likely result 
especially on the big island there will also be some surf 
manning said wave action associated with a fastmoving hurricane 
like dalilia tends to bunch up and arrive close to the passage of 
the center surf on hawaii islands southern beaches was not 
expected to increase until midday tuesday he said 
harry kim hawaii county civil defense administrator called a 
briefing monday with hawaii island agencies responsible for 
monitoring surf at this time it seems like the worst we will 
have is surf problems kim said

the dozen heavily armed officers abandoned 
their cars haphazardly on the street and raced across the housing 
projects muddy yard their guns aimed at the doors the windows 
though trying to ignore the children setting off firecrackers 
next door in a belated fourth of july celebration they flinched 
occasionally as the explosions went off 
these guys were on edge for two months the members of the us 
marshals service and local police had worked for the street terror 
offender program that nabbed 456 fugitives wanted on drug or 
drugrelated homicide charges in the washingtonbaltimore area 
on this dreary july afternoon they stormed into the southeast 
washington home in search of a 40yearold fugitive james alston 
according to the officers alston failed to appear on a cocaine 
distribution charge and violated parole 
the officers had been briefed at their navy yard headquarters on 
the homes basic layout but they had no idea whether anyone inside 
would be armed waiting for them so they kept their guns drawn 
wore bulletproof vests some of them weighing up to 35 pounds and 
carefully scanned each room 
ten officers remained outside making sure no one escaped or 
tossed contraband out a window 
there was no resistance as the entry team barged into the home 
and discovered a young woman and her baby on the living room couch 
upstairs past the bathroom door hanging by one hinge to the 
rotting door frame they found six men and a woman some already had 
injected heroin others were preparing to do so one man had a 
needle sticking into his ankle and it pulled when he jerked his 
leg blood dripped down soaking into his white canvas shoe 
one by one the entry team sent the addicts down the stairs to 
fellow officers ordering them to keep their hands on their heads 
they were directed to keep their fingers entwined palms outward 
but the maneuver was beyond them 
sullenly quietly the addicts walked downstairs they provided 
their names and whatever identification they carried at least one 
would turn out to be false 
ever been in jail one was asked 
no 
oh come on 
no 
whens the last time you were in jail 
about a month and a half ago 
and so it went with officers peering at the mens faces and 
comparing them with a grainy photocopy of alstons picture 
eventually a wiry man came down the stairs he said his name was 
bradley but he matched the photo at an officers direction he sat 
on the couch beside the other refugees from the shooting rooms 
an officer confronted the man and asked if he was mr alston 
the man smiled slightly as he nodded his head resigned to the 
inevitable 
thats what i like about him said an officer as alston was 
escorted outside the guys honest 
operation stop which targeted fugitives for eight weeks starting 
may 22 eventually arrested 25 people on drugrelated homicide 
charges the other 431 including alston had at least three 
previous felony drug arrests or convictions and were wanted on new 
charges 
although 62 percent of those arrested were considered armed and 
dangerous no shots were fired during the raids us marshals 
service director stanley morris said monday when the results were 
announced 
the 13 million federal program involving 56 federal marshals 
and 34 local officers from the district of columbia the surrounding 
suburbs and baltimore was shut down after eight weeks even though 
another 229 people targeted for arrest remain at large the marshals 
service said 
people get tired morris said in an interview when asked why 
the program ended before all the suspects were arrested 
eight weeks is a long time our experience is thats about 
the length of time you can run an operation like this without people 
starting to get homesick a little careless and start to lose their 
edge 
back in southeast washington the officers were on alert 
until we leave were in control bellowed metropolitan 
police department sgt ricky barrow if you want to get up ask 
somebody 
what weve seen today gives us about carte blanche to come in 
here anytime we want he lectured the woman who rents the home 
the woman whom a tipster had identified as alstons girlfriend 
everything leads us to believe youre running a crack house 
heroin he said as she shook her head saying theres no crack 
the officers eventually freed everyone but alston even though 
they were caught shooting heroin and two full hypodermic needles 
were found in a dish on a bedroom dresser 
why clog up the system said one officer 
before the sixhour series of raids was over about two dozen 
addicts and squatters had been rousted 
half were found in a wellknown shooting gallery the team has 
raided repeatedly after ordering the addicts to lie down on the 
raindrenched sidewalk and checking their identification the 
officers cut them loose 
one marshal told an addict familiar to such busts see you 
later

a second former federal housing official is 
refusing to testify about his role in the scandalriddled department 
of housing and urban development 
hunter cushing a former deputy assistant hud secretary invoked 
his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination monday before a 
house subcommittee investigating hud operations 
meanwhile subcommittee chairman rep tom lantos dcalif said 
monday his panel is not considering granting immunity to anyone 
lawyers for former hud official deborah gore dean have met with 
lantos and the subcommittee staff but no deal was reached that 
would prevent her testimony from being used against her in some 
possible prosecution 
last month ms dean who was executive assistant to former hud 
secretary samuel pierce jr also invoked constitutional protection 
in refusing to testify 
cushing told the panel he hoped to testify at the appropriate 
time but said he had not received enough documents from the 
agency to allow him to prepare for his testimony 
in these circumstances until ive had an opportunity to review 
all the transactions that may be discussed i have decided to 
follow my counsels advice and assert my fifth amendment rights in 
response to questions concerning activities at hud cushing said 
the subcommittee is investigating allegations of 
influencepeddling abuse and mismanagement at the agency current 
hud secretary jack kemp has suspended three hud programs and ordered 
an agencywide review 
other witnesses in the investigation have testified that ms dean 
used her authority at hud to direct funds to developers who used 
consultants with political connections during the reagan 
administration 
one of those consultants fred bush who has been nominated to be 
ambassador to luxembourg has told the panel one of his colleagues 
had been directed by cushing to seek out ms dean in securing 
funding for a project 
lantos labeled absurd a request by cushing that subcommittee 
members submit their questions to him in advance 
cushing is now a deputy assistant secretary for loan programs at 
the commerce department a senior department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said cushing went on unpaid leave about a 
week ago at the urging of the department 
earlier monday former hud secretary carla hills defended her 
role in helping persuade pierce to ease restrictions on drg funding 
corp a client company that eventually cost the government millions 
of dollars in bad loans 
i dont disagree that the company had misbehaved and was being 
spanked thrashed if you like and you feel that it should be 
strung up ms hills said drg hired her law firm in 1981 to 
represent it in housing matters 
hud has indefinitely suspended the company frm doing government 
work congressional investigators say the lender cost the government 
at least 695 million in bad loans and that the figure could rise 
to 300 million 
ms hills told the house panel she was hired because of her 
housing expertise and not because of any influence she might still 
have at the department currently the us trade representative ms 
hills served as hud secretary during the ford administration 
she said drg paid 33500 for her representation including a 
onehour meeting with thensecretary pierce 
meanwhile the house appropriations committee sent a bill 
including funds for hud to the full house but without money for a 
housing rehabilitation program involved in the investigation 
with tens of millions of dollars still unspent in the program 
the committee directed hud to issue rules prohibiting the use of 
consultants by companies lobbying the agency for approval of their 
projects

the taxpayers investment in surplus farm 
commodities continues to show a sharp decline from last years 
levels largely as a result of droughtreduced crop production in 
1988 and rising market prices 
an agriculture department report released monday showed the 
commodity credit corp had 135 billion invested in price support 
loans and actual inventories as of may 31 that included 91 
billion in loans outstanding and 44 billion in governmentowned 
commodities said the report by keith bjerke the cccs executive 
vice president 
a year earlier on may 31 1988 the ccc had an investment of 
231 billion including 143 billion in loans outstanding and 88 
billion in inventories 
the ccc finances various price support operations of the 
department including those for wheat feed grains rice tobacco 
cotton soybeans dairy products honey and sugar 
in the case of the major grain crops the 1988 drought reduced 
production and pushed up prices that reduced the need for price 
support loans and forfeitures which means the ccc takes over 
ownership of crops when farmers opt not to repay the loans 
when market prices are high enough its usual for farmers to pay 
off the loans and use or sell as they choose 
the farmerowned grain reserve which enables wheat and feed 
grains to be stored and kept off the market under government loan 
until prices rise enough to trigger their release consisted of 287 
million bushels of wheat valued at more than 1 billion as of may 
31 the report said 
corn and other feed grains in the reserve totaled more than 103 
billion bushels valued at 257 billion 
the total value of commodities acquired by ccc in the first eight 
months of the fiscal year that began last oct 1 was 172 billion 
the report said in the same period of 198788 ccc acquired 
products valued at 962 billion 
net losses to ccc totaled about 352 billion through may 31 the 
report said compared with a loss of more than 10 billion in the 
same eight months of 198788 the decline was mainly due to the 
smaller volume of grain moving into ccc inventories and reduced 
payments to farmers 
dairy inventories held by ccc also continued to edge down from 
the high levels of a few years ago 
as of may 31 for example total holding were reported at 5676 
million pounds of products valued at 7594 million compared with 
7159 million pounds with a ccc investment of 8201 million 
inventories of dried milk and cheese were down sharply but the 
butter stockpile was up from a year ago

agriculture department scientists are working 
on an edible nearly invisible coating made from milk that could 
extend the shelf life of fruit and vegetables 
attila e pavlath a chemist with the departments agricultural 
research service said tests are concentrating on a film based on 
casein a milk protein a small amount of vitamin c is added to help 
protect against browning 
pavlath who works at the agencys research laboratory in albany 
calif said in a report released here on monday that small pieces 
of sliced and peeled apple dipped in the coating stayed fresh for 
several days unprotected pieces shriveled and turned brown within a 
few hours 
the scientists want to make the film thinner a process that 
might take two more years pavlath said 
films that the tongue cannot feel and the taste buds cannot 
detect also could be made from protein in soybeans corn and 
wheat the report said 
some people who like fresh produce dont necessarily want to 
spend time in their kitchen washing slicing peeling pitting and 
paring pavlath said its part of the trend toward buying food 
that is ready to use and easy to store 
a successful coating would allow more types of produce to be 
presliced and packaged such coatings may have other potential 
uses perhaps for keeping fillings in pizzas or preventing pies from 
soaking the crust 
unlike waxes on cucumbers or other edible coatings such as the 
skin on sausages new films could be modified to add flavors or 
colors to standard fare pavlath said 
one possibility he said would be fresh sliced pears protected 
with a somewhat thicker protein coating flavored with red cherries 
john m krochta a former chemical engineer at the albany 
laboratory who is now at the university of california davis said 
an ideal edible coating should keep out microbes that promote 
softening browning mold and other types of decay 
the coating should also trap vital moisture in produce to keep it 
fresh yet enable it to breathe by taking in oxygen and giving 
off carbon dioxide he said

managers of a key star wars experiment who 
claim major progress with a potential antimissile weapon say 
congress budget cuts leave the futuristic space defense program 
up in the air 
the real issue is what is the funding for sdi said air 
force col thomas meyer the head of the strategic defense 
initiative organizations office of directed energy 
its difficult for me to tell you when well have a weapon in 
space without a clear definition of what our future funding is and 
its continuing to be up in the air meyer told reporters 
he spoke at a pentagon news conference monday on the results of 
sdis latest experiment which for the first time shot a beam of 
atomic particles into the heavens 
the bear or beam experiment aboard rocket was considered a 
primary step in the pentagons reseach into the lasers beam 
accelerators and other futuristic weapons to shoot down nuclear 
missiles 
meyer said elements of the experiment have produced 
ontheshelf hardware but that some engineering problems still 
need to be worked out 
it only takes the money to put it together and thats when 
well get the weapon he said 
the 60 million experiment launched over white sands missile 
range in new mexico last thursday was conducted to test how a 
neutral particle beam accelerator would work in space 
the sdi system would make use of particle beams as a potential 
antimissile weapon a beam would be shot across space to determine 
whether an object fired into the sky is a decoy or an enemy warhead 
also the beam could be used to disable such a missile 
last weeks experiment involved lifting into space just for a 
few minutes a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small aires 
rocket before the rocket returned to earth the accelerator was 
turned on and scientists collected data on how it worked and how the 
particle beams moved 
meyer and his aides declared the test a success displaying a 
fuzzy black and white video tape of the bright pulsing beam as it 
emerged from the rocket 
meyer said the experiment showed that the complex equipment 
needed to produce the beam could be made compactly survive being 
shot into space and function well 
we took a laboratory experiment and showed it can be 
operated autonomously in space it is a major achievement both in 
technology and engineering meyer said 
overall meyer said the experiment clearly demonstrates the 
promise of sdi that we have talked about all along 
the director said the programs designers and scientists also 
wanted to test how the beam acted in space and how space affected 
the beam 
the test came as secretary of defense dick cheney has been 
fending off budget cuts directed at the billiondollar program by 
capitol hill 
last month the house armed services committee voted to slash 
11 billion from cheneys budget for the antimissile program by 
voice vote the committee approved a 35 billion budget for sdi 
considerably less than the 46 billion president bush proposed for 
the program 
on friday the senate armed services committee reduced the 
administrations request to 45 billion

house taxwriters seem intent on changing the 
catastrophic health program for retirees but they apparently will 
have to do it without cutting the tax on capital gains 
in the face of intense lobbying the house ways and means 
committee was working on a plan today that could reduce both the 
special tax bite on older americans and some benefits from 
catastrophic health insurance 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the committee chairman said after 
a fruitless day of negotiating monday that his own proposal for 
solving the catastrophic care problem will not include a cut in the 
capital gains tax 
asked why he responded because im a democrat 
president bush has proposed a capital gains cut as a way to raise 
revenue although not necessarily for financing the catastrophic 
program many democrats are reluctant to go along because most of 
the direct benefit from a lower tax on capital gains profits from 
the sale of stocks and other investments would go to people with 
incomes over 100000 a year 
the committee is working on a bill to raise 53 billion in new 
revenue for deficit reduction in the budget year that begins oct 1 
the committee is likely to attach to that bill several tax 
amendments including measures extending a handful of tax benefits 
that are expiring and whatever agreement can be reached on 
catastrophic insurance rostenkowskis statement monday left some 
committee members wondering where they would find the revenue to pay 
for those tax benefits 
although bush contends a lower capital gains rate would boost 
revenues several years into the future democrats say it likely 
would be a moneyloser after the first year when many investors 
would find it beneficial to sell some assets 
but a congressional source said monday night the bush 
administration is willing to accept an increase in the wage ceiling 
on which the hospitalization part of social security taxes is 
levied raising revenues without raising tax rates 
the extra revenue would be aimed at easing but not completely 
eliminating the income surtax on elderly americans with high 
incomes that finances catastrophic health insurance coverage for 
medicare recipients 
administration tax officials told the committee in a closed 
session monday the proposal by rep pete stark dcalif was 
generally acceptable the option would increase the wage base on 
which the 29 percent payroll tax for medicare coverage is levied 
from 50700 to 60000 in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 and 
make state and local government employees subject to the tax for the 
first time 
members of the committee make no effort to disguise their concern 
about the catastrophic program that is because many older americans 
who are paying for most of the program dont like the financing 
mechanism 
members say most of the fire has come from higherincome 
retirees some of whom are paying a surtax of up to 800 this year 
so older people with low incomes can also be protected against some 
of the costs of a catastrophic illness 
the people who are paying the most insist the expense of 
providing catastrophic protection for the poor should be borne by 
society in general 
for 1989 the surtax is 15 percent of a retirees ordinary income 
tax above 150 about 59 percent of retirees pay no surtax at all 
56 percent are paying the full 800 
the rest of the cost of the insurance is paid by most persons 65 
and older through a 4 increase in the 2790 monthly premium they 
already pay for doctors fees coverage 
a plan under discussion monday but gaining little support 
would have eliminated the surtax and transferred more of the cost to 
elderly people with lower incomes and to workers in general

george bushs vision of a kinder gentler 
nation may collapse under the weight of a severe economic crisis 
that forces a leaner meaner society to cancel social programs for 
the poor and elderly an expert believes 
amitai etzioni director of the center for policy research at the 
george washington university said he and other experts believe the 
united states may soon face an economic disruption so severe that 
government spending would be cut into the bone resulting in 
what he called a meaner society 
a major major economic shakedown could result in a 10year 
belttightening he said monday following a keynote address to the 
general assembly of the world future society if that happens 
society will find it very difficult to be generous and gentler and 
kinder belt tightening almost inevitably leads to a meaner more 
conflictfilled society 
etzioni said he cant guarantee there will be such a serious 
national financial shakedown but he noted the longer we delay 
our economic solutions the severer the crisis will be i would 
think that american society is not about to become kinder and 
gentler 
bush in his speech accepting the republican nomination for 
president last august pledged a kinder gentler nation and that 
became a theme of his campaign 
etzioni said current efforts by congress and the bush 
administration to cut the federal deficit by reducing government 
spending increases are some extremely minor trimming just window 
dressing and adjustments 
the belttightening im talking about would be larger by an 
order of 10 said etzioni in such an event he said our 
society will not be able to afford the essentials of decent and safe 
social programs we will not only be unable to afford the 
luxuries we will have to cut into the bone 
he described a meaner society as one doing away with programs 
like head start which is designed to help the early education of 
poor children and taking mental patients and throwing them into 
the street 
it means cutting down on police forces school lunches make it 
tough for handicapped to apply for social security taxing the 
elderly for medicare said etzioni above all it means using 
social security to cover deficits 
averting such an economic crisis he said may require a major 
change that would allow the us economy to grow at a faster pace 
but he said he doesnt believe the political parties have shown 
the willingness to deal with such a tough issue 
etzioni is also a visiting professor at the harvard business 
school and author of a book called the moral dimension which 
deals with social sciences and economics 
the fiveday meeting of the world future society concludes on 
thursday

a move to sharply limit the interior 
secretarys power over the national park service is headed to the 
senate amid complaints that park employees have been intimidated by 
administration officials 
rep bruce vento dminn is expressing optimism that anger over 
decisions by top interior department officials is strong enough to 
push through a measure that was not considered by the senate last 
year 
individual senators have contacted me concerned about the 
undermining of park professionals he said 
the house by voice vote approved legislation monday that would 
give the head of the national park service a fixed term and make the 
person answerable directly to congress 
vento chairman of the house interior subcommittee on national 
parks and public lands said the measure would give more power to 
professional park employees who have been harassed intimidated 
and drummed out of the service by administration policies 
supporters said environmental concerns were being swept aside by 
businesses interested in using the parks for commercial development 
rep peter kostmayer dpa told of the reagan administrations 
approval jan 19 of ski lift construction over the appalachian trail 
in vermont that was opposed by the interior departments career 
staff 
he said the career staffs opposition was reversed when the 
proposal reached the top political appointees in washington 
special interests have been better represented than the assets 
of the parks vento said the way they do that is by suppressing 
the professionals 
the legislation would require the president to nominate a park 
service director who would be confirmed by the senate for a 
fiveyear term that could not be terminated except for just cause 
the interior secretary would relinquish power over the parks 
including hiring of personnel keeping only the power over the 
budget and cabinet policy authority 
the park service director now is appointed by the president and 
is not subject to senate confirmation 
opponents of the bill led by rep john rhodes rariz tried 
unsuccessfully to change the measure they say president bush will 
veto the bill if it passes unchanged in the senate 
although the bill was approved by voice vote the key vote came 
on rhodes amendment that would have eliminated all provisions of 
the bill except the one requiring the director to be confirmed by 
the senate it failed 148251 
although that margin was wide supporters of the bill would have 
to get more votes to override a presidential veto 
interior secretary manuel lujan told the house interior committee 
this year he would recommend a veto if the bill passed in its 
present form according to department spokesman tom wilson 
steve whitney of the wilderness society which pushed for the 
legislation emphasized the environmental damage that could occur 
when the professionals are ignored 
he said the interior secretarys office last year decided to 
allow oil and gas exploration in the floridas big cypress national 
preserve despite the objections of all the professionals in the 
department 
this is the everglades said whitney it is extraordinarily 
biologically rich and fragile 
he said the wilderness society sued to stop the exploration 
which would have required extensive use of explosives the day a 
judge was to hear arguments for an injunction two weeks after 
exploration work began the interior department stopped the project

president bush traces his ancestry to 
religious dissenters who fled here for the new world according to a 
city archivist who says the president also is a distant relative of 
vice president dan quayle 
the archivist theo schelhaas presented bush with a copy of his 
family tree monday showing his links to an english couple who 
married in leiden in 1603 the president was in the netherlands for 
a 24hour stop the last in his 10day journey 
bush appreciated very much that his lineage had been fleshed 
out said pieter de baar a research assistant for schelhaas 
a small community of english protestant dissenters lived in 
leiden for more than a decade before setting sail for america in the 
early 17th century 
bush is a direct 12th generation descendant of francis cooke and 
his canterburyborn wife hester mahieu according to schelhaas 
records 
little is known about the cookes except their marriage date june 
4 1603 and that they had three children including their daughter 
jane cooke a bush ancestor born here in 1615 
according to the leiden records bushs roots can also be traced 
to another pilgrim family the sisters abigail and sarah jenney 
both born in leiden and daughters of a brewers apprentice john 
jenney and his wife sarah carey 
bushs father was related to abigail jenney as well as to the 
cookes and his mother is a descendant of sarah 
bush in his remarks at st peters church in leiden joked 
im glad to be back with my cousins because we fondly remember 
aunt abigail back there those many years ago 
de baar said the records show the president also is a distant 
relative of vice president dan quayle with some branches of their 
ancestry going back to a 14th century family living on the isle of 
man and of archivist schelhaas himself 
you might say theyre cousins in the 35th degree de baar 
said referring to bush and quayle 
leidens mayor gh goekoop also mentioned bushs roots and 
pointed out that two other american presidents william howard taft 
and franklin delano roosevelt had ancestors in leiden 
yes here in leiden not only the dutch and american nations 
come together indeed even the families of democratic and 
republican presidents are linked goekoop said we believe the 
american reality began right here when the pilgrims asked for 
refuge

the united states is offering to pay up to 
250000 per victim to the families who lost relatives when a us 
navy cruiser shot down an iranian airliner in the persian gulf last 
year 
the state department says however that the us government will 
only turn over the money if the iranian government names an 
appropriate intermediary to disburse the funds 
an intermediary possibly another government or an insurance 
company is needed to make sure the proper people benefit from the 
money officials said monday 
some 250 iranians were among the 290 people killed on iran air 
flight 655 july 3 1988 when the cruiser uss vincennes mistakenly 
fired on the jetliner 
the payment plan personally approved by president bush calls 
for the united states to give the families of each fulltime worker 
250000 while the families of others will receive 100000 to get 
the money families would have to waive legal claims against the 
united states 
the package could total 30 million with the money coming from a 
special department fund 
although the united states is not liable under international 
law to pay compensation to the families of flight 655 victims on 
july 11 1988 president reagan announced that in accordance with 
the humanitarian traditions of our nation the united states would 
do so on an ex gratia basis boucher said in a statement 
the commander of the vincennes said he believed he was threatened 
with attack when he fired the missile at flight 655 after warning 
the pilot 
the united states has contacted officials in india italy 
pakistan the united arab emirates and yugoslavia to have them relay 
the offer to victims families there 
although the countries have yet to respond boucher said the 
united states is confident the offer will be accepted 
the same offer has been communicated to the government of 
iran he said unfortunately during the past year the government 
of iran has ignored repeated efforts by the united states to obtain 
information from the families of the iranian victims iran was 
contacted through an unidentified channel

united states aid to the afghan rebels will 
continue despite reports that 30 rebel military leaders were 
murdered in an ambush by a rival resistance commander 
our commitment to support the mujahedeen is very clear state 
department spokesman richard boucher said monday and the nature 
and character of our support is unchanged and it will continue 
boucher said the us is still investigating the reports of the 
internecine killings which apparently took place july 9 in the 
fakhar valley northwest of kabul 
we deplore this tragic and brutal act he said it can only 
play into the hands of the enemies of a free afghanistan we urge 
the mujahedeen to focus on the vital work of improving unity and 
cooperation 
boucher said peter tomsen washingtons special envoy to the 
mujahedeen interim government is looking into the attack 
preliminary information indicates the rebels were ambushed by a 
rival mujahedeen commander affiliated with gulbuddin hekmatyar 
boucher said hekmatyar heads a faction of islamic fighters who 
reportedly have received aid from washington 
the murdered commanders were returning from a strategy planning 
session with ahmad shad massoud boucher said adding that tomsen 
met with one of massouds brothers last week 
pressed on whether the incident might prompt us human rights 
concerns he said were looking into this incident and im sure 
well draw the appropriate conclusions

asked at a news conference about reports of stepped up us 
assistance to the rebels who seek to bring down the marxist 
government in kabul

nearly 100 boat captains protested the 
dredging of muck from the san francisco bay which they say is 
suffocating fish devastating the fishing industry and creating 
toxic hazards 
fishermen blew their horns and flew flags of protest on monday to 
call attention to the more than 10 million cubic yards of new 
sediment that ends up in the bay every year 
boats displayed banners that read stop choking our bay 
stop the dumping and muck kills 
bob martin 27 a recreational fisherman who has been fishing for 
striped bass in the san francisco bay since he was a young boy said 
he was worried by the decline of the fish 
right now its hardly worth fishing for them he said i 
just hope we get to the point that if i have kids someday i can tell 
them what a striped bass is instead of what it was 
we want the people of california to know and the politicians 
to know and the regional water board to know that our bay just 
cannot take anymore dumping of dredging spoils said keith fraser 
former president of the united anglers association we are at the 
saturation point 
but bill prout spokesman for the us army corps of engineers 
which does most of the bay dredging and oversees the rest defended 
dredging as a necessary means of maintaining shipping channels in 
the naturally muddy area 
weve been dredging here for 65 years and it hasnt killed off 
all the fish up to this point prout said the species here live 
in the turbid environment 
dredging critics also fear that an underground mountain of 
dredged muck west of alcatraz island poses a navigational and toxic 
hazard the alcatraz dump site is targeted for closure in december 
1991 but critics want it closed immediately 
critics said seals and sea lions already have fled the bay for 
cleaner water and striped bass and halibut populations have been 
way down in recent years 
demonstrators want the muck hauled up the sacramentosan joaquin 
delta to shore up levees or at least 25 miles out to sea where the 
ocean depth drops abruptly from a few hundred feet to at least 3000 
feet 
prout said it costs between 2 and 3 per cubic yard to haul 
sediment from the port of oakland to alcatraz compared to estimated 
costs of up to 8 per cubic yard to haul it out to seas 
theres not an easy answer to this problem he said 
denny larson of citizens for a better environment conceded that 
proposals to haul dredging spoils beyond the bay will be costly but 
he said keeping open the alcrataz dump site may pose greater costs 
dredging stirs up toxic chemicals like cadmium mercury nickel 
lead zinc and petroleum hydrocarbons said greg karras a toxicity 
specialist for citizens for a better environment 
karras said about 40 percent of all dumped material ends up 
recirculating in bay waters about 30 percent remains near alcatraz 
and another 30 percent is swept out to shallow ocean areas 
were creating toxic hot spots underwater karras said

soldiers opened fire to break up 
a small demonstration at the university of el salvador and eight 
people were reported injured including an american who broke his 
leg while fleeing 
students said the soldiers fired to prevent the roughly 30 
demonstrators from leaving the campus monday night but a military 
officer said the troops were returning shots fired from inside the 
school 
no soldiers were reported hurt 
the protest was called to demand that soldiers free rene cruz an 
economics student and leader of the general association of 
salvadoran university students students say soldiers arrested him 
sunday but the army denied it 
the military said in a statement on the demonstration that the 
students committed acts of provocation against the troops that 
guard and provide security to the university of el salvador 
during the protest police defused a car bomb 500 yards from the 
1st infantry brigade headquarters near the school the statement 
said it did not say whether the military believed the protest and 
the bomb were related 
several students who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soldiers fired to keep the demonstrators from leaving the campus 
but col francisco elena fuentes commander of the 1st infantry 
brigade said in a telephone interview that sovietmade ak47 rifles 
were fired from inside the school and that firebombs were thrown 
in television film of the disturbance shots appeared to be 
coming from one of the campus buildings 
ambulances were not allowed onto the campus until the shooting 
stopped two hours after the disturbance began said a red cross 
worker who requested anonymity he said eight people were taken to 
hospitals including a man who identified himself as robert drennon 
33 of new york city 
drennon who said he has been studying spanish on a student 
exchange program told reporters when i heard the shots i ran and 
i broke my leg 
the red cross did not describe the injuries suffered by the other 
seven protesters who were taken to the hospital 
the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front fighting for 
nine years to overthrow the usbacked government said in a call 
to a local radio station that its urban units were not involved in

attorneys for a divorcing couple who are 
battling over control of seven frozen embryos have established key 
differences over the donors rights in an invitro fertilization 
program 
in a brief filed monday j g christenberry an attorney for 
mary sue davis who is seeking the right to have the embryos 
implanted in her said that males have never had any control over 
the reproductive process once they have fertilized an egg 
the fact this case represents an artificial method of 
fertilization and conception and that the gametes are in artificial 
storage only allows the opportunity to artificially change a law of 
nature which has been determined since the beginning of history 
he wrote 
but charles clifford attorney for junior lewis davis said in a 
brief filed in circuit court friday that that to give mary davis the 
sole right to decide what to do with the embryos would leave junior 
davis only to ponder when and if he will be a father and what his 
legal emotional and psychological relationship will be with any 
children mary davis may elect in her sole discretion to bear 
the trial is scheduled for aug 7 
junior davis 30 sued his 28yearold wife for divorce in 
february in that suit he asked the court to ensure that his wife 
could not have any of the seven frozen embryos that he had 
fertilized implanted without his permission 
mary davis has since countersued and claims she can have the 
embryos implanted if she so decides regardless of her husbands 
wishes or their marital status 
clifford in his brief on behalf of junior davis said the 
embryos which are in storage at the knoxville hospital where the 
davises participated in an invitro fertilization program are not 
persons under the law and thus can be treated as property 
he also argued that both junior davis and mary davis have a 
fundamental right to control their reproduction process and the 
decision should not be made by one party alone 
christenberry said that junior davis consented to his wifes 
pregnancy when he entered the invitro fertilization program with 
her 
and he said mary davis contribution to the in vitro program was 
greater than her husbands because the process involved in 
removing egg cells from her body is much more discomforting than the 
sperm donation process 
invitro fertilization involves surgically removing a womans 
eggs from her ovaries and fertilizing them with a mans sperm in a 
laboratory dish

for years northrops chief test pilot 
had to contain his enthusiasm for the progress of the topsecret 
stealth bomber 
but bruce j hinds emerged monday from the cloak of secrecy 
surrounding the radarevading b2 as the aircraft itself left its 
giant hangar and took to the air 
the pilot and air force test pilot richard couch had high 
praise for the arrowheadshaped planes handling characteristics 
it was meant to fly hinds said it likes to fly 
hinds 50 and the 43yearold couch applied terms such as 
nimble and beautiful to their sunrise test flight 10000 
feet above the mojave desert 
for hinds a former air force test pilot who has flown 66 
different aircraft including the u2 spy plane and the f104 
starfighter the flight from a northrop hangar to nearby edwards air 
force base represented a rendezvous with history 
i had always been fascinated with flying wings hinds said 
referring to the wingshaped prototypes built by aviation mavericks 
in the 1930s and 1940s on which the b2 is based 
the northrop pilot couldnt indulge his curiosity publicly 
however little more than a year ago the stealth bomber with a 
program price tag of more than 70 billion did not officially 
exist for a decade it lurked in the shadows of the pentagons 
highly classified black programs 
since hinds was the bombers chief test pilot he had to maintain 
the same vow of secrecy as the 32000 other workers in the b2 
program 
its often the case with test pilots that they cant discuss 
the airplane theyre working on said northrop spokesman tony 
cantafio 
still hinds crossed paths with other fliers at meetings of the 
society of experimental test pilots there he listened to pilots 
from earlier generations discuss test work from flying wings 
conceived before he was born 
as early as the 1930s aviation pioneer jack northrop was 
building such allwing aircraft stubbornly he contended the wings 
had great loadcarrying capacity superior fuel economy and 
aerodynamics 
during world war ii the germans built prototype allwing 
bombers todays b2 shares an eery resemblance to a horten bomber 
built for the luftwaffe but never flown in combat according to 
william sweetmans reference work titled stealth bomber at 
wars end german designers were working on a sixengine allwing 
jet bomber 
with the flying wing you get the feeling they should have kept 
going hinds said that whole series of planes was pretty 
remarkable for its time 
just as remarkable hinds said is the b2s advanced computer 
controls that keep the flying wing stable in flight without aid of a 
tail 
its like flying a conventional aircraft he said

hawaii island residents were urged to stock up on 
batteries canned goods and other emergency supplies as hurricane 
dalilia swirled toward the state 
late monday the hurricane was moving west at 20 mph several 
hundred miles eastsoutheast of hawaii island according to the 
national weather service its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 
mph with gusts up to 90 mph 
at that speed and course the hurricane was expected to pass 
about 150 miles south of hawaii island tonight however the weather 
service said a slight change in direction would bring the hurricane 
closer to the state 
storms have a mind of their own said lead forecaster hans 
rosendal weve put out a tropical storm watch in case dalilia 
strays from the path 
the weather watch issued monday afternoon warned residents that 
73 mph winds large waves and heavy rain could hit the island he 
said it was issued only for the island of hawaii 
an air force reconaissance plane from keesler air force base in 
biloxi miss was scheduled to fly through the storm tuesday to 
collect data on its intensity and direction according to the 
central pacific hurricane center here 
dal said it was too early to predict with certainty how dalilia 
would affect hawaiis weather 
it depends how close it comes he said there would 
probably at least be some heavy rain and high surf on the big 
island its too early to say about oahu and the rest of the state

a congressional study of the nations system 
for guiding aircraft says some air traffic controllers work without 
video screen information on altitude speed and direction for up to 
16 minutes 
however a spokesman for the federal aviation agency said monday 
safety had not been compromised thanks to adequate backup systems 
the long and short of it is that controllers are not working in 
the blind when these things occur dick stafford said backup 
systems provide them with information not as good as the regular 
information but were not going to put more aircraft in the sky 
than can be safely handled at any given time 
sen frank lautenberg dnj on monday released a draft of the 
study he had commissioned in march 1988 from the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress 
he also released a companion draft of a gao report on efforts to 
reduce near collisions it showed 231 of 326 such incidents 
involving commercial flights in 1988 were classified as serious 
but stafford said incidents of nearmidair collisions are 
actually declining 
he said the number of reports dropped by 33 percent in 1988 to 
their lowest level since 1985 through the first five months of 
1989 he said nearcollision reports were down another 23 percent 
from the same period in 1988 
in its study on the facilities used by air traffic controllers 
the gao recommended transportation secretary samuel skinner direct 
the faa to take action that would avert further interruptions of air 
traffic functions 
computer capacity shortfalls at terminal area facilities are 
widespread the study said faa did not recognize these capacity 
shortfalls until controllers began experiencing lost flickering or 
delayed data on their displays 
the faa plans to overhaul the existing traffic control systems 
with new equipment in the midtolate 1990s but the report called 
for skinner and the faa administrator to study available 
alternatives for the next 10 years 
the gao found between june 1988 and june 1989 computers at 27 of 
faas 63 larger airport radar control centers were overloaded 
the study said the problem could worsen with a requirement in 
effect since july 1 that all planes flying within 30 miles of large 
traffic control centers be equipped with transponders that transmit 
altitude information the requirement which affects 44000 
additional aircraft was designed to reduce near collisions 
the aircraft owners and pilots association which represents 
nearly 300000 operators of small planes want that requirement 
withdrawn 
adding additional workload to a system that is already severely 
overloaded will further jeopardize the safety of the flying public 
and general aviation in particular said association spokeswoman 
patricia weil 
lautenberg said it doesnt make sense if an effort to improve 
safety at one level degrades it at another 
steven schlein a spokesman for lautenberg chairman of the 
senate transportation appropriations subcommittee noted air traffic 
is being guided with 1960s technology 
the technology will be 30 years old by the time the new 
equipment comes in schlein said they didnt have a contingency 
plan for this for what to do in the meantime 
the faa plans to award a contract by sept 30 to unisys corp to 
acquire additional capacity for the air traffic computers which 
have been obsolete for years according to the study 
to supply the outdated processors unisys will have to restart 
a production line because these computers developed in the late 
1960s have not been manufactured since the 1970s the study said

president bush should veto legislation that 
would block him using money from other countries for activities that 
the us congress refuses to bankroll according to sen jesse helms 
this doesnt even make good nonsense because congress doesnt 
have the authority to do that helms rnc said monday as 
debate opened on an amendment offered by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny to a state department authorization bill 
moynihans proposal arises from the irancontra investigation 
when it was revealed that the reagan administration solicited funds 
from foreign nations to aid the contra rebels in nicaragua at a time 
when congress had barred using us funds to provide such aid 
during the hearings the countries were referred to by code names 
such as country one and country two and the like but it was

nomura securities analyst yoshiro inoue said the number of issues 
sold markedly outnumbered those purchased mainly because of 
concerns over the elections and the yens losses against the

a series of recent polls have predicted that the governing 
liberal democratic party will lose badly in the upcoming election 
although senior party leaders say they will win at least 54 seats of 
the 126 to be decided sunday analysts see that as a tough goal 
the governing party has lost its popularity due to an 
influencepeddling stock scandal an unpopular sales tax and reports

death threats to a pair of roman catholic priests 
are a daily ritual now they say it is proof that their crusade 
against the sale of drug paraphernalia is paying off 
at hundreds of stores throughout the city an elementary school 
pupil looking for candy can find himself shopping sidebyside with 
an addict buying a new crack pipe the priests say 
you go in a store and what you see right off is bread candy 
and drug paraphernalia said the rev michael pfleger this is 
teaching children that drugs are an ordinary part of life 
and death 
drugs are the no 1 killer ive had to deal with said 
pfleger a white priest who for nearly 15 years has ministered to 
the allblack congregation at st sabinas 
between them pfleger and the rev george clements whose 
parishes are in the citys south side have attended hundreds of 
funerals for junkies drug pushers and bystanders killed in drug 
warfare 
in my neighborhood its an epidemic a raging epidemic said 
clements virtually no family has been left untouched 
finally it became too much for the priests both of whom have 
the added worry of their own adopted sons being exposed to and 
possibly lured into drugs 
our effort is really to heighten the contradiction in a society 
which says that its legitimate to buy drug paraphernalia but 
illegal to take drugs said clements thats the height of 
hypocrisy 
that may stop soon 
a bill outlawing the sale of drug paraphernalia was recently 
passed by the state general assembly gov james r thompson is 
expected to sign it 
the priests say theyve been meeting with local congressmen as a 
first step toward a national ban 
their efforts have brought confrontations with store owners and 
misdemeanor arrests for refusing to leave shops in chicago and in 
clements case in shreveport la 
each saturday pfleger and 100 or so parishioners fan out to the 
neighborhood liquor stores groceries and video shops that openly 
sell the drug gear from clements holy angels church the priest 
and parishioners make daily forays 
some of the stores have scales for weighing cocaine and 
substances for diluting the drug most have the users tools such 
as pipes glass vials and capsules 
in the last two months about 400 stores have taken the 
paraphernalia off shelves the priests say those that dont readily 
agree get repeated visits and threats of boycotts 
some doubt the usefulness of the priests work 
we pulled it off the shelf no problem said ali saleh who 
agreed to remove the paraphernalia from shelves at the fampg liquor 
and food mart he manages but there has to be a law against it or 
people can just go down a block or two and theyll be selling the 
same thing there 
as the priests efforts have progressed so have the threats 
not a night goes by without a half dozen telephoned threats 
usually between 2 am and 6 am said pfleger 
written death threats have been flung through church windows with 
rocks 
clements who is one of the nations bestknown black catholic 
priests and who officiated at last years wedding of heavyweight 
boxing champion mike tyson and actress robin givens said someone 
recently smashed his car window and tore out the radio and air 
conditioning 
a note read the first of many from your friendly drug 
dealer 
obviously were having an effect pfleger said 
the priests now plan to take their fight against drugs further 
to the doorsteps of pushers 
we want people to tell us where drugs are being sold he 
said and when we find out well put a sign up saying a drug 
dealer lives here and the neighbors want him to leave the 
neighborhood 
pfleger acknowledged it could be dangerous 
but fear is not going to do anything to stop us he said 
the only thing were afraid of is not doing anything

a judicial review has accepted an investigation 
that found that icy wings rather than a bomb caused a 1985 plane 
crash that killed 256 us servicemen and crew in gander 
newfoundland a newspaper said today 
the review found no need to reopen the case the paper said 
the canadian aviation safety board probe was controversial 
because five board members said icy wings caused the crash while 
the other four theorized that a bomb was to blame 
some board members also charged that evidence pointing to a 
terrorist attack was withheld 
sources at the safety board and department of transport said the 
review ordered in march by transport minister benoit bouchard 
generally exonerates the boards staff investigators the toronto 
globe and mail said 
the newspaper said in todays editions that the review written 
by justice willard estey a former supreme court of canada judge 
will be released friday 
the fivemember majority on the investigatory board found that a 
thin layer of ice reduced the lifting capacity of the wings of the 
arrow air jet causing the chartered aircraft to crash on takeoff on 
dec 12 1985 
the paper quoted sources as saying the review gives no credence 
to the bomb theory or to claims that evidence was withheld 
the dissenters suggested a coverup by canadian and us agencies 
sought to hide what they argued was a terrorist attack on the aging 
dc8 that was taking us troops home for christmas after a 
peacekeeping tour in the middle east 
no evidence of a bomb has ever been presented although the 
dissenters say its absence demonstrates the wideranging nature of 
the coverup 
safety board chairman ken thorneycraft refused monday to discuss 
esteys review he said he was unaware of its findings but added 
that he had always been confident that any independent assessment of 
the agencys investigation would conclude it was conducted 
thoroughly and reached reasonable conclusions 
critics of the icing finding including the us airline pilots 
association have accused the board of fabricating evidence in a bid 
to blame the planes pilots both pilots six other crew members and 
all 248 us servicemen on board died in the crash the worst ever 
in canada 
the globe and mail also said les filotas one of the boards 
dissenters sent a letter to estey saying arro air may have been 
involved in armsforhostages exchanges conducted secretly on 
behalf of highly placed individuals in the american administration 
and that if so there would have been strong motivation for 
attempts to confound aspects of the investigation 
the letter obtained through the access to information act 
suggests the unsubstantiated link could also have been a motive for 
targeting air arrow for a terrorist attack the newspaper said 
it said estey returned the letter dated april 2 unread to 
filotas

americas first astronaut in the 1960s 
space race with the soviet union opposes joint missions today but 
not for political reasons 
i think it would be a step backwards to go that route alan 
shepard said monday during a visit to the space and rocket center 
for space celebration 89 festivities i would rather see us 
develop the technology to have planetary travel manned and 
unmanned 
a separate celebration of the 20th anniversary of the 1969 moon 
walk meanwhile included some bitterness 
about 40 aging german rocket scientists who helped build 
americas space program expressed disappointment that one of their 
brethren was not present for a reunion of the 20th anniversary 
celebration of americans landing on the moon 
arthur rudolph project manager for the saturn 5 rocket at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville remained in voluntary 
exile in his native west germany under threat of prosecution for 
alleged nazi war crimes if he returned to the united states 
its a shame for the united states to send out a man who did so 
much for the united states said scientist konrad dannenberg 
everyone here should be ashamed this thing happened 
rudolph now 84 retired in january 1970 after helping send two 
spaceships to the moon and moved to san jose calif where he lived 
in relative obscurity for 14 years 
his tranquil retirement ended when the justice departments 
office of special investigations raised allegations that during 
world war ii he was involved in the deaths of thousands of 
concentration camp prisoners who were forced to work in a v2 rocket 
factory where he was technical director those allegations were 
backed up by some survivors 
rudolph left the country and returned to hamburg west germany 
where a twoyear investigation found no offense against rudolph his 
west german citizenship was returned 
shepard one of 12 americans to walk on the moon disagreed with 
apollo 11 moonwalker edwin buzz aldrin who said during a trip 
to huntsville saturday that america should pursue joint missions 
with the soviet union and possibly japan 
i think our space technology level in general is ahead of the 
soviets shepard said 
shepard now 65 rode a huntsvillebuilt redstone rocket into 
space on may 5 1961 as the american space program rushed to catch 
the soviets who had sent yuri gagarin into space on april 12 
he returned to space in february 1971 on apollo 14 and became the 
fifth man to walk on the moon a feat never matched by the soviet 
union shepard is now is a commercial real estate developer in 
houston 
meanwhile children who werent alive when man first landed on 
the moon got a chance to guide another spacecraft to a lunar 
landing monday 
fifteen students worked at the challenger centers mock mission 
control in houston while another group of children were flying 
in a simulator at a second challenger center in greenbelt md they 
were helped by flight controllers who were in nasas mission control 
during apollo 11s historic landing 
the youths talked through headsets and completed checklists 
before giving the goahead for the mock landing 
the centers built as a memorial to the seven astronauts who died 
in the explosion of the space shuttle challenger offer youngsters a 
chance to learn by participating in simulated missions

tons of medical waste near a trash hauling company and said they 
suspected a link with organized crime according to a report today 
authorities are trying to determine whether the body parts 
arms legs and part of a torso discovered in september belonged to 
an mob execution victim or victims and if so whether other victims 
were disposed of the same way 
there were no fingers or other identifiable parts a law 
enforcement source told the daily news 
city and federal investigators got and executed a search warrant 
for the company nationalstage carting after a tip from a mob 
informant the report said 
they found the parts in a refrigerated trailer full of medical 
waste which was packed in more than 50 boxes parked on a side 
street near the company in the brooklyn borough

confirmed that the trailer contained body parts 
the newspaper said the tractortrailer was registered to 
rosendale haulage a florida company with ties to anthony vulpis 
vulpis nationalstage owner angelo paccione and a developer 
fred weiss were indicted last month on federal charges of

dump that allegedly stored infectious medical waste 
vulpis nephew anthony senter was convicted recently of 
racketeering and a civil rights conspiracy during his 17month 
trial witnesses said he disposed of two mob execution victims who

the tipster identified senter as the man who killed the victim 
whose body parts were found at nationalstage the newspaper said 
the two cases have nothing to do with each other said ben 
brafman the attorney for vulpis and senter it is stretching the 
truth to connect them 
paccione is a major player in a mob carting cartel controlled by 
the gambino crime family investigators told the daily news

connections and that nothing improper happened at the dump

15monthold halfsister tiffidie anne were rescued from the pool 
tiffidie anne was found floating face down in the shallow end of

taffidie was on the bottom of the pool near her sister she 
didnt show a pulse but was revived en route to the hospital 
officials said she remains in critical condition and on life 
support systems at texas childrens hospital spokeswoman tina 
foster said

regardless of what they thought they were beasley said i 
cant imagine anybody standing there looking at two kids in the 
pool they would be better off out of the pool no matter what 
district attorney john b holmes said there are no criminal 
sanctions for failing to rescue the children 
but common sense suggests that no caring thinking human being 
would stand handily by while two kids were drowning he said 
the girls apparently left their apartment sunday morning while 
their mother slept and wandered into the pool 
the girls mother tammie patterson 20 said she learned her 
children had fallen into the pool when an unidentified man knocked 
on her door 
i dont understand why they didnt try to save the children 
said ms patterson 
its too late she said ive got one baby thats dead and

the retired commander of a nato intelligence 
gathering post said he noticed a drop in material from east bloc 
sources in late 1985 and 1986 when two men accused of passing 
secrets to east germany were working at the base 
retired col kenneth roneys testimony monday came on the opening 
day of the federal trial of huseyin yildirim 61 who is accused of 
scheming with army warrant officer james william hall iii to provide 
military secrets to the soviets and east germans 
yildirim worked as a civilian mechanic at an army auto shop in 
west berlin during halls time at the field station 
army intelligence experts said the operation funneled information 
about the wests eavesdropping capabilities to east german and 
soviet agents for more than six years they said the case appeared 
to have inflicted serious damage to electronic spying efforts in 
europe 
roney who was commander of the berlin field station from 1984 to 
1986 testified that toward the end of his command he noticed a 
reduction in the amount of material coming to the berlin listening 
base from eastern bloc sources 
roney also testified that hall yildirims alleged 
coconspirator attracted his attention at field station berlin in 
1986 because he owned a 21000 1985 volvo 760 gle auto roney said 
he was hesitating about buying the same model on his colonels 
salary 
the government is prosecuting yildirim while trying to avoid 
disclosing details about the intelligence operations he is accused 
of harming two experts at the trial representing the defense 
departments national security interests effectively were serving 
as censors 
during roneys testimony the experts objected to several defense 
questions regarding the operation of field station berlin 
did anyone under your command engage in counterespionage 
activities asked defense attorney lamar walter roney was not 
allowed to answer because the security advisers said the response 
might include classified information 
in opening arguments assistant us attorney fred kramer said 
the intelligence operation that the two men are accused of violating 
was needed to overcome the warsaw pacts edge in conventional forces 
in europe 
what is required to equalize the balance is information 
kramer said 
walter said his client did not participate in this conspiracy 
to the extent he should be charged 
i know some of you read spy novels you never know what the 
conclusion is until you read the last chapter walter told the 
jury adding that hall did most of the work 
the trial is being held in savannah since hall was stationed at 
nearby fort stewart at the time of his arrest kramer said hall who 
was courtmartialed in march will be a government witness against 
yildirim hall 30 was sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined 
50000 
hall pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage attempted 
espionage and failing to obey army regulations he was dishonorably 
discharged and forfeited all future army pay and allowances hall 
admitted to army officials he received more than 100000 between 
1983 and 1988 to provide classified documents to eastern bloc agents 
yildirim identified in court documents as meister bie or mike 
jones the man hall identified as his conduit of classified 
national defense documents to east germans is charged with 
conspiring with hall to provide classified information from 1983 to 
1988 hall was named as a coconspirator in yildirims indictment 
yildirim has been held in seclusion since his arrest at his 
belleair beach fla home in december

for the first time since he was exiled a 
masscirculation magazine has published a work by alexander i 
solzhenitsyn a speech in which he urges other writers to throw off 
the shackles of communist censors 
the 10page speech was published monday in novy mir the nations 
leading literary journal solzhenitsyn wrote it after winning the 
nobel prize for literature in 1970 
soviet officials barred him from traveling to sweden to give the 
lecture 
publication of the nobel speech marked another important step 
toward the rehabilitation of solzhenitsyn who was kicked out of the 
soviet writers union in 1969 and exiled to the west five years 
later 
the chronicler of stalinist terror was sent abroad after western 
publishers published his magnum opus the gulag archipelago a 
critique of soviet rule since its birth in the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
in his nobel lecture solzhenitsyn condemned the persecution of 
millions of soviets including writers he urged his fellow authors 
to describe reality as they saw it not as dictated by communist 
authorities 
the whole of our national literature lies buried not only

a man charged in the murder of a church 
volunteer was a smalltime burglar but no murderer a defense 
attorney said during the first day of john david browns murder 
trial 
brown 34 went on trial in circuit court monday more than two 
years after a slaying that touched off an intensive twomonth 
manhunt 
browns flight from the law inspired songs tshirts and other 
local folklore but the state regards him as a murderer and is 
seeking the death penalty 
in his opening remarks browns courtappointed attorney brad 
kessler portrayed brown as someone who had a penchant for stealing 
guns but he said brown was no murderer 
however assistant attorney general tim finnical said tests from 
four ballistics experts showed that the 357caliber magnum revolver 
brown carried when he was arrested at a motel in oklahoma was the 
same gun used to kill claude long 56 
long was shot and his car stolen shortly after he opened the new 
life apostolic church near doolittle in southcentral missouri for 
evening services on april 1 1987 
at the time dozens of police officers were manning road blocks 
and searching the surrounding ozark hills for brown who was wanted 
for wounding a rolla police officer with a rifle two days earlier 
brown had been at large since escaping from the ozark 
correctional center near springfield in june 1984 he was serving a 
fouryear term for burglary and possessing explosive weapons 
two hundred law officers from across the state including 
national guardsmen were involved in the twomonth search for brown 
the evidence will be that this man deliberately took a life to 
steal a car to avoid capture finnical said 
kessler said that the state was relying on circumstantial 
evidence no one saw long killed and police did not find browns 
fingerprints in the church he said

the french edition of the satanic verses goes on 
sale in bookstores wednesday and its publisher said orders have 
been brisk despite the controversy and violence the book has 
provoked in other countries 
the novel first published in english last year is considered 
blasphemous by many moslems before he died last month irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on moslems to kill the author 
salman rushdie 
two iranian clerics supported the edict by offering a 52 
million bounty 
demonstrations against the book by angry moslems have occurred in 
many cities around the world including several in england rushdie 
an indianborn writer now living in england has been in hiding 
under police protection 
of the 55 million people living in france 25 million are moslem 
i am not publishing this book to reignite a religious war but 
because a publisher must respect his obligations christian 
bourgois head of editions christian bourgois publishing company 
said in a radio interview today 
i am publishing it under my name and i have received the 
public support of the minister of culture jack lang in the name of 
the government to publish a book is not a provocation for a 
publisher 
publication of the french edition has been postponed several 
times bourgois said the delay was in the translation and that he 
only received the definitive french version in june 
i dont feel in danger but i can only take seriously the 
demonstrations that occurred in the middle east in pakistan or in 
london bourgois said he said he and his family had been taking 
special security measures since winter 
this is the integral version of the book bourgois said 
there was never any question of publishing a modified or truncated 
version i have always intended to publish this book in its integral 
version that is 585 pages 
the publisher would not say exactly how large the printing of the 
french first edition was its a big printing he said 
tens of thousands of copies have been ordered most of the big 
department stores have ordered copies as well 
the book is considered blasphemous by many moslems because it 
includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of the wives of 
the prophet mohammed and because it suggests that mohammed wrote the 
koran himself rather than receiving it from god

from cornfields and the backs of pickup 
trucks hundreds of people waved at amtraks montrealer passenger 
train as it snaked through northwestern new england for the first 
time in more than two years 
the washingtontomontreal train resumes endtoend service for 
the public beginning today following mondays special train that 
left amherst mass and ended in montreal 
the montrealer has been a fixture in new england since 1972 but 
the train stopped running north of springfield mass in april 
1987 amtrak said 49 miles of track had deteriorated so badly that 
the train could only inch along at 5 mph in spots 
the former owner guilford transportation industries and amtrak 
couldnt agree on payments for repairs and amtrak finally asked the 
interstate commerce commission to condemn the line the icc agreed 
and another railway bought the line and fixed it with a 
congressional appropriation 
money has also been set aside to fix another 50mile stretch in 
massachusetts in the meantime the train is running on an alternate 
route in connecticut and massachusetts 
about 400 politicians rail buffs and train executives were 
aboard mondays train 
a fife and drum corps greeted them in claremont nh where 
passenger rail service returned for the first time in 23 years 
my wife and i are going to go to montreal on this train in a 
couple of weeks said tom burnham one of 300 to welcome the train 
in claremont this is great for the area its the only stop in 
new hampshire but i think its excellent an opportunity we cant 
afford to miss 
the politicians took turns engineering the train with vermont 
gov madeleine kunin in the drivers seat as the train pulled into 
montpelier 
we look at passenger train service as a nostalgic look into the 
past but i really think its a look into the future she said 
if youre worried about the ozone layer up there heres one 
alternative 
mike brazinski an assistant conductor from waterford ny saw 
another reason to make the trip

ronald lauder has spent 85 million so far in 
his quest to become mayor more than any mayoral candidate in new 
york history according to a report 
all the mayoral candidates filed campaign finance reports 
tuesday and lauders dwarfed that of five other strong candidates 
former us attorney rudolph giuliani lauders opponent in the 
republican primary has raised between 12 million and 14 million 
ninetythree percent 79 million of lauders campaign money 
came out of his pocket according to the new york times in todays 
editions 
lauder an heir to the estee lauder cosmetics fortune had an 
income last year of 30 million and reported his net worth at 227 
million 
the republican primary turnout is expected to be about 100000 
campaign aides told the times so lauder has already spent about 85 
on each potential voter 
the bulk of lauders spending has gone for television ads 5 
million worth 
the finance reports indicate that all the candidates except 
lauder are having trouble raising money and as a result public 
matching funds for their campaigns is likely to be lower than 
anticipated 
manhattan borough president david dinkins has raised nearly 19 
million 
mayor edward i koch also has 19 million to spend 
city comptroller harrison j goldin has between 14 and 17 
million 
and former metropolitan transportation authority chairman richard

absentee leadership bad economic forecasting and 
taxcut fever all may have contributed to massachusetts current 
budget crisis but theres no simple explanation for how the best of 
times turned into the worst 
people still find it difficult to understand how a state 
overflowing in money with a presidential nominee for a governor 
wound up in a financial hole 
this state had six of the most extraordinary years in our 
history gov michael s dukakis said monday maybe we began to 
believe it would never change 
in 1986 as dukakis told everyone who would listen massachusetts 
was a miracle state able to pay for new innovative programs and 
cut taxes at the same time the major domestic debate that year was 
over what to do with a 348 million budget surlus fueled by a 
booming state economy 
three years later dukakis suffered what he called the most bitter 
day of his political career this coming from a man who lost 40 
states in the presidential election dukakis last thursday unable 
to convince voters to support a tax increase cut nearly a half 
billion dollars from the state budget 
the 491 million in budget cuts included a 210 million reduction 
in state aid to cities and towns for such things as schools and 
police a 97 million cut in human services and 62 million from 
education 
the explanation dukakis gives for the state fiscal situation is 
that revenue taken in by tax collectors plummeted over the past two 
years and the state has been been taking up the slack left by reagan 
administration budget cuts 
both are true revenue experts can talk for hours about how 
changes in the federal tax code the stock market crash of october 
1987 and this years sales tax decline made a mockery of their 
revenue estimates the numbers on which state spending is planned 
but critics who hold a more conservative fiscal viewpoint than 
dukakis say the governor and the legislature over the past six years 
simply allowed state spending to rise out of control 
james howell chief economist of the bank of boston dismissed 
the notion that faulty revenue forecasts led massachusetts into its 
current crisis the right question is if they had been given the 
right information all along would they have had the courage to make 
the right decisions 
partisan critics have blamed the 18month dukakis presidential 
campaign for leaving the state without a leader as the financial 
crisis developed others see roots much deeper 
from 1984 through 1989 state spending increased 673 percent or 
nearly three times the rate of inflation according to the 
massachusetts taxpayers foundation personal income during the same 
period has gone up 51 percent 
figuring precisely what the massachusetts public wants has not 
always been easy in one recent newspaper poll for example 64 
percent of those responding opposed an emergency tax increase passed 
by the legislature to make up for last years budget deficit in the 
same poll 65 percent said they were opposed to dukakis budget 
spending cuts for this fiscal year 
some argue that the fiscal conservatives those most critical of 
dukakis and state spending are partially to blame for the current 
crisis 
in 1986 when state revenue was pouring in dukakis under heavy 
pressure from the legislature and public opinion repealed a surtax 
he had imposed in his first term the move cut state revenue by 280 
million other tax cuts which dukakis eventually supported trimmed 
revenue by some 400 million during the past six years ironically 
those cuts just about equal the shortfall the state is facing

defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of e 
robert wallach have called one former us attorney general as a 
witness but they will not get a chance to question the man 
currently holding the post 
us district judge richard owen on monday threw out a subpoena 
to call attorney general richard thornburgh to the stand 
wallachs attorney gary naftalis said he wanted to question 
thornburgh about an internal justice department report that faulted 
former attorney general edwin meese iii a defense witness 
the report which was issued in january said meese had violated 
codes of ethics in his efforts to help wallach in an illfated 
mideast oil pipeline proposal and to assist him with the wedtech 
corp 
wedtech once a small machine shop in the south bronx grew into 
a 100 million government contractor through a special small 
business administration program that set aside contracts without 
competitive bidding for minoritycontrolled companies 
evidence at earlier trials has shown that wedtech continued to 
receive the nobid contracts through a series of bribe schemes even 
after it ceased to be a minorityowned company 
wallach a san francisco attorney who is a longtime friend of 
meese is charged with two others in a 21count racketeering 
indictment with extracting almost 2 million in illegal payoffs and 
payments from wedtech including 525000 in alleged bribes to 
wallach to influence meese and other government officials 
meese was asked about the report when he was crossexamined by 
assistant us attorney baruch weiss last thursday 
weiss submitted into evidence a press release that stated 
thornburgh had accepted the report after meese testified that 
thornburgh had not adopted the reports findings 
naftalis argued that weiss had incorrectly stated that thornburgh 
had adopted the findings of the departments office of 
professional conduct 
according to naftalis thornburgh had in fact distanced himself 
from the report and had delayed its release so meese and his lawyers 
could prepare a rebuttal made public on the same day 
naftalis said weiss tried to make it look like meese had lied to 
the jury and that he needed to question thornburgh to set the record 
straight 
weiss opposed the subpoena and said thornburghs testimony would 
be irrelevant 
the other defendants are w franklyn chinn 47 a former wedtech 
board member and onetime meese financial adviser and a business 
associate of theirs r kent london

a wooden replica of a civil warera sailing 
vessel sank in the north atlantic after its sevenmember crew was 
rescued from a massive ice pack shrouded in fog the ships builder 
says 
a danish shrimp boat responded to the sheila yeates mayday call 
on friday and plowed through ice and fog to save the crew said 
geoffrey pope 76 who built and skippered the ship 
the trawler towed the ship 430 miles from the spot off the coast 
of greenland where it was trapped but the boat took on water and 
finally was cut loose and sank monday he said 
the sheila yeates a topsail ketch with a 50foot deck was one 
of the tall ships that commemorated the us bicentennial the ship 
left duluth on may 15 bound for cornwall england 
popes account was delivered from aboard the trawler to friends 
in the minneapolis area just moments after the ship went down 
i feel very responsible pope said i lost the ship but 
aside from that i feel such a reaffirmation of the potential of 
the bond that exists between men in extremus 
pope said the voyage went smoothly until thursday when the ship 
approached a point about 80 miles south of greenlands point farwell 
and encountered ice farther south than expected 
in an apparent misunderstanding over ice conditions the sheila 
yeates found itself in thick fog surrounded by massive chunks of ice 
with no room to maneuver the shifting ice would have crushed the 
wooden ship to bits pope said 
the trawler kiviuq which fishes in the arctic and is equipped 
with icebreaking equipment responded to the tall ships mayday by 
radio the skippers of the two vessels traded navigational 
coordinates until the kiviuq broke through the ice pack and found 
the sheila yeates

a tamil leader with close links to 
india was shot and killed by unidentified assailants in colombo 
police said today 
uma maheswaran 44 was killed on sunday said a police official 
speaking on condition of anonymity the leaders body which had a 
gunshot wound in the head was identified late monday the official 
said 
last week two other tamil leaders also considered proindia 
were shot and killed in their colombo residence witnesses 
identified the assailants as members of the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam a rebel group fighting the 40000 indian soldiers 
deployed in northern and eastern sri lanka 
the tigers denied the charge 
in madras india a spokesman for sri lankan tamils said 
maheswaran had been attacked by tiger assailants at least three 
times in the past the spokesman ponnudurai ravinesan said 
maheswaran was targeted because he broke away from the tigers in 
1975 to form his own militia 
maheswaran headed the peoples liberation organization of tamil 
eelam a former rebel group that accepted an indiansponsored accord 
in 1987 aimed at ending the insurgency by members of sri lankas 
tamil minority who seek greater autonomy 
the tigers rejected the agreement and turned their guns on the 
indians since may the tigers have been holding talks with the sri 
lankan government and both sides have called for indian soldiers to 
pull out by the end of july 
india has refused saying a hasty withdrawal will enable the 
tigers to attack rival tamil groups and escalate violence on the 
island nation 
the issue has soured relations between the colombo and new delhi 
and both sides have exchanged sharplyworded letters on the subject 
meanwhile a spokesman for the tigers said 16 members of the 
group left colombo on monday after concluding a round of talks with 
the government the talks started in may the fist direct contact 
between the two sides since the insurgency began in 1983 
both sides say they are satisfied with the progress in the 
negotiations another round of talks will be held soon the tiger 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
at least 9000 people have been killed in the tamil insurgency 
which was launched by at least a halfdozen guerrilla groups the 
victims have included many tamils caught up in internecine fighting 
india became involved in sri lankas problems because of the 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils for the rebel cause 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
allege they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 
75 percent of the population

a religious groups call for a oneyear boycott of 
products made by mennen co and clorox corp for advertising on 
television shows full of sex violence and profanity was 
denounced by some advertising and tv executives 
christian leaders for responsible television or cleartv 
announced monday that it singled out clorox and mennen for placing 
ads on offensive television programs from april 27 through may 24 a 
sweeps period during which the popularity of network programming 
was gauged 
we hope that concerned americans will join us in this boycott 
and in our efforts to preserve the quality of life we enjoy in this 
country said billy melvin chairman of the suburban wheatonbased 
group 
but advertising executive george lois said calls for such 
boycotts were threats to the independence and creativity of his 
industry 
were in a hell of a shape if people succumb to those kind of 
tactics said lois chairman of loisggk in new york 
sue binford a spokeswoman for nbc said cleartv is ignoring 
americas traditions of free choice and free speech in attempting to 
define for others what is acceptable programming 
were confident that viewers who believe in their own right to 
choose what to watch on television will support the advertisers that 
have been unfairly singled out and will recognize this onesided 
misguided tactic for what it is ms binford said 
programs the group found particularly offensive during that 
period included miami vice tour of duty and midnight 
caller melvin said 
cleartv describes itself as a coalition of 1600 christian 
leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people its founder 
the rev donald wildmon of tupelo miss is a vocal critic of 
antichristian television 
in a written statement the mennen co said it should not act as 
a censor for cleartv or any other group objecting to programs 
sponored by the manufacturer of toiletries the company said it 
prescreens shows and doesnt advertise on shows that dont meet its 
standards 
clorox said in a statement that the company for years has had 
very stringent standards for the shows it buys time on it said 
the shows were prescreened by its advertising agencies and there 
is no indication they did not meet our standards

veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski 
is taking a big and politically perilous step in streamlining the 
network of veterans hospitals and clinics but hes counting on a 
commission to help take the heat 
even so the recent shock of military base closings recommended 
by a pentagon commission might make the maneuver more difficult for 
derwinski 
it would be hard to take a hospital closures bill where we just 
got through with base closures rep gv sonny montgomery 
dmiss said monday after derwinski announced his proposal 
va facilities like military bases are pet projects among 
members of congress largely because of the jobs they provide 
montgomery head of the house veterans affairs committee said 
he would cosponsor the bill out of courtesy to derwinski but will 
give it only one hearing and put off further action until next year 
on the other side of the capitol sen frank murkowski ralaska 
said he will help sponsor derwinskis bill but has also introduced 
his own which specifically makes closings a possibility derwinski 
only talks about changing missions and realignments 
its no secret that when va desires to modify the size or 
mission of va facilities its efforts are met with a great deal of 
resistance from members of congress who represent those districts or 
states said murkowski the ranking gop member of the senate 
veterans affairs committee 
a mechanism to remove political considerations from discussions 
of mission changes and consolidations is desperately needed he 
said 
his and derwinskis bills would be all or nothing giving 
congressmen virtually no chance of reversing decisions to close the 
facilities once the process has started 
sen alan cranston dcalif and chairman of the senate veterans 
affairs committee said only i will work with the administration 
to develop acceptable legislation 
as a result of the military baseclosing panel 86 installations 
and housing complexes were ordered closed and 54 received new 
missions montgomery said some similar decisions could be made about 
hospitals with some changing to outpatient facilities for example 
murkowski noted no va hospital has been closed since the johnson 
administration when six were closed 
if established by congress the commission would examine all 172 
department of veterans affairs medical centers plus hundreds of 
clinics and treatment units the nine to 15 members chosen by the 
va secretary would make an allornothing proposal to the va by 
jan 1 1991 
the va secretary would send the proposal to congress if the plan 
is approved the recommendations would have to be implemented by 
jan 1 1997 
the members would be chosen from the fields of clinical care 
academic medicine research and veterans interests 
we have an aging veteran population that is also shifting 
geographically and we have pressures on the va system that must be 
addressed derwinski said this legislation provides the impetus 
for getting many of our problems solved quickly rather than trying 
to make piecemeal changes 
said murkowski the practice of medicine is constantly changing 
due to advance in medical technology and sometimes as a result of 
efforts to control the cost of health care the delivery of care has 
shifted from a system which relied on inpatient hospitalization to 
increases in outpatient care 
the number of veterans over 65 is increasing meaning a greater 
need in nursing home care and care for the diseases of old age

a golfer who shot a holeinone to win a 
car will get to keep it even though he made the shot two days after 
the car contest ended 
a car dealer had refused to deliver the 1988 chevrolet beretta gt 
that amos cobaugh claimed after hitting the shot on the ninth hole 
of the fairview golf course in southeastern pennsylvania in may 1987 
the car was intended as a prize for a charity golf tournament two 
days before cobaugh played the car and signs announcing the prize 
for a holeinone were still on the tee when cobaugh dropped the 
ball into the cup with one shot during another tournament 
in a 21 decision released monday the pennsylvania superior 
court said cobaugh is entitled to keep the car offered by 
klicklewis inc of palmyra 
contract law dictates that if a person performs as stated in a 
contest and wins its an enforceable contract the court said 
a person reading the signs would reasonably understand that he 
or she could accept the offer and win the car by performing the feat 
of shooting a holeinone said judge donald e wieand 
i feel great said cobaugh 56 an electrician for hershey 
foods it was his only holeinone in 21 years of playing golf he 
plays about twice a week 
the dealers attorney robert m frankhouser jr of lancaster 
said the dealer fears the ruling will discourage other car dealers 
from donating vehicles for charitable purposes 
in a dissenting opinion judge zoran popovich said the contract 
couldnt be enforced because giving a car for a holeinone amounts 
to illegal gambling 
quoting statistics from golf digest magazine popovich said an 
average golfer playing a par3 hole of average difficulty has a 
1in20000 chance of acing the hole a professional has a 
1in10000 chance the judge said

were put inside a horse trailer and driven off a cliff in may 1983

the b2 stealth bomber is a 
revolutionary advancement in intercontinental bombers that was in 
development for 18 years air force officials say 
the b2 was designed to evade detection by sophisticated enemy 
air defenses with an unorthodox design of curves and contours 
the stealth technology does not elude enemy radar so much as 
absorb it reflecting little radar energy back to ground receivers 
were talking about an aircraft now that basically negates the 
air defenses built up in many many places around the world over many 
years said gen bernard p randolph who directs research 
development and testing of aerospace systems for the air force 
the flying wing design was first conceived in the 1940s by 
northrop corp founder jack northrop although the yb49 aircraft he 
built was scrapped by the government in 1948 in favor of more 
conventional bomber designs 
a factor leading to the demise of the yb49 was a crash that 
killed air force test pilot glen edwards the mojave desert air 
force base that now bears his name has become a focus of advanced 
flight test research 
the history of the flying wing came full circle monday as the 
b2 successfully completed its maiden flight and landed smoothly at 
edwards 
the bomber is about 17 feet high and 69 feet long only slightly 
longer than an f15 fighter 
the wingspan however is about 172 feet almost the span of a 
b52 bomber 
it is powered by four general electric engines mounted on top of 
the wing the air force says the engines were derived from those 
used in f16 and f14 fighters 
the bomber flies at subsonic speeds and is capable of hugging the 
terrain closely or flying as high as 50000 feet the air force said 
the b2 has an operational range of more than 6000 nautical 
miles at high altitudes and more than 10000 nautical miles with 
aerial refueling capability 
the aircraft will carry both nuclear and conventional weapons 
the air force said 
the twohour test flight was conducted with the landing gear 
extended during the entire flight 
northrop test pilot bruce j hinds 50 and copilot air force 
col richard s couch 42 said they flew the bomber at three speeds 
and guided it through numerous turns to test its stability 
couch described the b2 as a very nimble aircraft and said 
the landing approach was rock steady

crews battling a stubborn 
wildfire reinforced their air power today and continued to struggle 
to cut a containment line through steep terrain 
the fire which flared up over the weekend after experts thought 
it was defeated has burned 3000 acres of pinyon trees and juniper 
brush but has spared anasazi indian cliff dwellings in the park in 
the southwestern corner of the state 
firefighters planned to double their capacity to dump 
fireretardant slurry on the flames by setting up a depot in the 
park to load the chemical mix into three helicopters working the 
blaze they previously had to shuttle to durango or grand junction 
20 and 120 miles distant respectively 
the staff on the fire lines was tripled monday to 260 said fire 
information officer john pasquantino and fire bosses were hoping to 
contain the blaze wednesday 
officials estimated the blaze was 85 percent contained and there 
were about 3 miles of fire line left to build the remaining 15 
percent however was on extremely steep terrain pasquantino said 
and containment wasnt expected until wednesday afternoon 
elsewhere in the west 
the us bureau of land management launched a renewed attack 
against a weekold lightningcaused blaze in pinon juniper and sage 
that was estimated at 1000 acres outside rangely in northwestern 
colorado blm spokesman mike rieser said the blaze approached a 
ranch and a cow camp but firefighters moved engines in and prepared 
to backburn an area to protect them 
decreasing winds helped turn a wildfire away from summer homes 
and a fish hatchery in southwestern utah but officials doubled 
their manpower in case the 6500acre blaze explodes today forest 
service officials added 10 more pumpers and 400 fresh firefighters 
to the lines monday night in anticipation the blaze burning in the 
dixie national forest east of cedar city would grow to 8000 acres 
the fire is one of five uncontained blazes in southern utah

progress is about to claim another 
victim the depressionera ringdown telephone system that has been 
serving 18 homes in the canyon of idahos salmon river 
on dec 15 the operator keeping the customers of the north fork 
telephone co in touch with the outside world will be replaced by an 
atampt computer 
the new equipment will no longer make the link between the 
worlds communications system and the crankoperated canyon 
telephones that run on batteries and magnetos residents will be 
able to talk to each other but wont be able to connect with the 
outside world 
the system is the last of its kind in idaho and one of the last 
in the united states 
it hit us so unexpectedly weve always been assured we would 
have this service said marsha smith who with her neighbors is 
accustomed to living without electricity and only seasonal running 
water in the central idaho canyon cut by the wilderness river 
century telephone co which has been providing the operator 
offered to help solve the problem but since it is becoming simply 
the local exchange company manager frank barsalou said there was 
little his company could do 
the systems users are linked to the world beyond by a single 
wire connected to insulators hanging from rocks poles and trees 
calls to and from the outside must go through a local operator who 
buzzes the proper phone with a coded ring 
the system originally served the us forest service and it was 
bought by the resident cooperative in 1952 when the government 
switched to radio communications 
the canyon is too curvy for antenna radios to work and while 
residents of the 18 homes strung along a 31mile stretch of the 
canyon could hire their own operator it would cost more than 1600 
a week 
because the salmon is a wilderness river in that area west of 
north fork the forest service refuses to allow new aboveground 
telephone lines and burying the phone cable could cost 600000 
neither is economical and canyon residents dont want to change 
anyway 
we would much rather have this for a wilderness area north 
fork vice president john booker said 
idaho public utilities commissioner perry swisher said he 
believes phone service can be saved if everyone cooperates until a 
technological answer can be found 
but swisher said whats bothered me personally is that i 
havent seen much imagination by the telecommunication people in how 
to get down that canyon with service

a new agreement calling on the census bureau to 
doublecheck its 1990 results and adjust them if necessary could 
mean more federal money for some cities and changes in congressional 
representation 
the federal government agreed on monday to examine results of the 
1990 census and adjust them if necessary to correct a historical 
undercount of minorities and inner city dwellers 
this is a civilrights issue not a money issue said new 
york city corporation counsel peter l zimroth the money is 
secondary what we want is the most accurate count there are people 
in this country who are not brought into account they are losing 
representation 
mayor edward i koch who called the agreement a a great 
victory for the city added the impact is money 
relying on the oneperson onevote doctrine new york city 
joined by two states and several major cities with large minority 
populations and civilrights organizations filed suit last 
november to get the census bureau to use a statistical method 
devised to correct the undercount 
the dispute focuses on drawing electoral districts for the house 
of representatives 
because the house is limited to 435 members distributed 
according to population areas where people are missed in the census 
lose seats to other states in addition many federal programs 
distribute money according to population 
under a settlement announced in federal court the commerce 
department and the census bureau agreed to set up an eightperson 
panel of statisticians and demographers to review the results of the 
1990 census and recommend to the commerce secretary whether the 
numbers need to be adjusted 
the secretary will not be bound by the recommendations 
following the nationwide head count the census bureau also will 
conduct a massive followup survey sampling 150000 households 
nationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted 
a somewhat smaller survey already was planned to evaluate the 
count 
following criticism that it missed as much as 1 percent to 2 
percent of the population in 1980 the census bureau already 
analyzed the possibility of adjusting its figures for undercounting 
of some population segments 
however last fall the commerce department parent agency for the 
census decided against making an adjustment 
commerce officials said they didnt believe any sample could be 
as accurate as the national head count itself they also said they 
were concerned an adjustment would undermine public confidence in 
the census 
that decision was widely criticized 
barbara bailar the census official who researched methods of 
adjustment resigned she is now head of the american statistical 
association bailer could not be reached for comment on mondays 
agreement 
in addition some local officials accused the department of 
playing politics in the decision an accusation the department 
denied 
because the undercount largely affects minorities and innercity 
residents most often represented by democrats critics asserted 
that republicans stood to benefit from cancelling the adjustment 
plans 
the agreement provides for a careful and thorough 
reexamination as to whether the census requires adjustment to 
produce a more accurate population count secretary of commerce 
robert mosbacher said in a statement 
in the suit joined by new york state california los angeles 
chicago houston dade county fla and several civilrights 
organizations new york city charged that the methods of the census 
bureau commonly undercount blacks hispanics the homeless and 
illegal aliens 
zimroth said the agreement potentially means many millions of 
dollars for the city in federal funds lost because of the 
undercounting it also could affect legislative boundaries which 
are drawn according to population 
according to the city the 1980 census missed as many as 500000 
people or 6 percent of the citys population the mayors office 
said the city has lost out on more than 200 million since the 1980 
census because of the undercounting 
stephen hart a justice department lawyer said that as many as 7 
percent of the nations blacks were overlooked in previous censuses 
the census bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount 
caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperating 
with neighborhood canvassers 
mondays agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminary 
injunction that could have stopped the 1990 census

republicans and democrats hailing the first 
successful flight of the b2 bomber warn that the 
halfbilliondollar aircraft must still clear the checkbook 
hurdle in congress 
the radarevading bomber accompanied by two f16 fighters 
performed test maneuvers during a nearly twohour flight monday in 
southern california a maiden excursion 18 months behind schedule 
despite the success lawmakers stressed that the stealth bomber 
which at about 500 million a copy is the most expensive plane in 
history looms large on the radar screen of the budgetconscious 
congress 
i think theres a great deal of reluctance to spend that much 
money per airplane said rep newt gingrich of georgia the no 2 
republican leader the president and defense secretary dick cheney 
will have to work hard to carry a vote in the house 
the pentagon has proposed 47 billion for the stealth bomber in 
the fiscal 1990 budget and about 24 billion for the program during 
a peak threeyear spending period in the mid1990s 
the house armed services committee last month slashed 800 
million from spending for the b2 program on friday the senate 
armed services committee trimmed 300 million from the bush 
administrations request and included a series of testing 
requirements before the plane could go into full production 
the full house and senate take up the defense bill and the 
spending level for the b2 next week 
i think its going to be one of the most controversial items in 
the defense authorization bill said house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash right now i would say its an uphill fight for the 
b2 
gen bernard randolph head of the air force systems command 
said on nbctvs today show this morning that the actual 
production cost would amount to 274 million per plane in 1989 
dollars when such expenses as research and development and spare 
parts were removed 
regardless of the differing cost estimates randolph said the 
real issue you have to ask is how we can afford not to have the b2 
which is fundamental to the deterrent posture of the nation 
were talking about an airplane that can literally penetrate 
hundreds of billions of dollars of air defenses in the soviet union 
so this is a fantastic step forward 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and a supporter of the stealth program said the b2s 
cost would not have been as high had the nation not gone ahead with 
building the interim b1b bomber 
i think when you look at the 23 billion in b2 research and 
development divide that into only 100 aircraft thats 230 million 
per aircraft that we already have invested nunn said on cbs 
this morning 
i think it tells us something about the cost of the b2 but it 
also tells us that we should never have produced the b1 then wed 
be talking about 200 stealth aircraft or more and you would be 
amortizing or dividing that very large research and development 
package into more aircraft he said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said the bomber just cleared one hurdle but the test 
program just begun has far to go to answer all the technical 
questions 
and the b2 has still another hurdle to clear the checkbook 
hurdle the issue is whether its worth the price 
members of the house plan a number of amendments on the b2 
including a measure that would mothball the production line after 
the manufacturer northrop corp has produced 13 bombers 
after testing and evaluation congress would have an opportunity 
to decide whether to continue or kill the program 
introducing the amendment will be an unusual coalition 
republicans john rowland of connecticut and john kasich of ohio and 
democrat ronald dellums of california 
the three members are planning an allout effort to win support 
for the amendment including calls and letters to their colleagues 
but at least two members indicated monday they wont support the 
measure 
right now im going to offer an amendment to sustain the cheney 
budget including full funding for b2 said rep william 
dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the armed services panel 
i think that at this point total termination of the program is 
probably premature aspin said 
rowland in response said only in washington can you spend 9 
billion and be accused of terminating the amendment would include 
spending that amount to meet its requirements 
while the battle lines were clearly defined on the house side 
members of the senate generally expressed their support for the 
program 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said he was very proud as an american with 
this accomplishment coming 20 years after man landed on the moon 
but sen john glenn dohio a member of the senate armed 
services committee said no more b2s should be funded until the 
results of flight testing are received 
one flight does not a test program make the former astronaut 
and test pilot said

a team of scientists led by a lawyer 
wearing a skullandcrossbones tshirt is homing in on the graves of 
five gold prospectors who were slain and cannibalized 115 years ago 
the 13 scientists and anthropologists on monday used 
radarmapping equipment to pick up underground abnormalities that 
could turn out to be the remains of the five victims of alferd 
packer the men died during a bitter winter in the san juan 
mountains 
onlookers and hot clear weather gave a festive atmosphere to the 
dig 
in addition to the skull and crossbones the tshirt worn by dig 
leader james starrs bore the legend gimme five the alferd packer 
expedition july 1989 
the george washington university law professor has nicknamed the 
site the bone zone 
the scientists working with starrs were to begin digging for the 
bones today based on the results of the radar mapping data 
its subtle but after years of looking at this type of data i 
feel confident that we are in the right place said stan smith an 
engineer who on monday operated the radar equipment at the site 170 
miles southwest of denver 
the scientists working with starrs are hoping to resolve 
lingering questions about how the five men died and whether packer 
consumed their remains 
the goldhunting party formed by packer became snowbound on the 
9000foot pass in 1874 maintaining one of the members of the party 
killed the four others packer said he was forced to kill the fifth 
in selfdefense packer also admitted to consuming the remains of 
the five to survive 
packer eventually was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 
40 years in prison he was paroled in 1901 and died april 24 1907 
the scientists are searching near a grave marker that was erected 
to the victims in an area known as deadmans gulch between 
cannibalism plateau and round top mountain two miles south of lake 
city 
the marker honors the five men who were murdered on this spot 
early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources of the 
san juan country 
the scientists were watched by residents and tourists who were 
kept behind barricades erected by the hinsdale county sheriffs 
department 
observers joked that the scientists probably would unearth the 
remains of such celebrities as jimmy hoffa or elvis presley belt 
buckles many sat in lawn chairs with coolers of refreshments by 
their sides 
although starrs is fairly certain the group will locate the 
bones walter birkby curator of physical anthropology at the 
arizona state museum in tucson who is on the dig was less confident 
he said there is no guarantee any bones were down there at 
all 
it would be wonderful to have 206 bones for each individual 
but its bloody unlikely birkby said we dont know if anything 
is there and we wont until we actually start digging 
the dig differs from usual practices of archaeologists who often 
are secretive about their research starrs however said his goal 
to raise 10000 to fund the expedition has not been reached 
leading him to encourage media coverage 
the group has set aside the week to search for the bones any 
findings will be sent to the arizona state museum at tucson for 
analysis 
next month starrs plans to restore the site to its 
preexhumation condition the expeditions results are scheduled to 
be released early next year

the nations worst oil spill resulted 
from arrogant and complacent managers who failed to prevent the 
accident and then failed to move quickly to contain the spreading 
ooze a state study concluded 
robert leresche who heads the states inquiry into the grounding 
of the exxon valdez said in a report issued monday that poor 
management by exxon shipping co not a berserk captain is to 
blame for the spill 
exxon shippings failures and lapses in management were so 
numerous and pervasive that it is a wonder the exxon valdez was the 
first tanker grounded leresche said 
he described alyeska pipeline service cos response after the 
spill in similar terms calling it a total massive 
incredible failure and likening it to something out of the 
keystone kops 
the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 shortly after leaving 
valdez spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince 
william sound 
the real causes of the exxon valdez disaster were not heroic 
but only pedestrian leresche said there was not a berserk 
captain waving a bottle on the bridge there was not an autopilot 
device run amok there was not a broken radar or a storm 
there were simply arrogant and complacent people at the top 
levels of exxon shipping co and alyeska pipeline service co who 
did not pay attention to their responsibilities 
leresches comments were contained in 110page document submitted 
to the national transportation safety board the document is the 
states proposed findings and recommendations based on the ntsbs 
weeklong hearings in anchorage in may the ntsb will issue its own 
findings later 
leresche was the states representative during the hearings 
calls for comment to exxon shipping offices in san diego and 
thousand oaks calif and houston texas were not returned monday 
but alyeska a consortium of seven oil companies including 
exxon that operates the transalaska oil pipeline and the valdez 
tanker terminal rejected leresches conclusions 
we totally disagree with the findings said alyeska spokesman 
tom brennan 
nothing alyeska could have done in the first 24 hours of the 
spill would have significantly affected the course or environmental 
impact of the spill brennan said he repeated the companys 
contention that the spill was simply too big to manage even if 
all the resources in the world had been instantaneously available 
alyeska also renewed its claim that its response was hamstrung by 
the unwillingness of the state and the coast guard to allow the use 
of chemical dispersants and burning to dissipate the spill the 
state and the coast guard repeatedly have dismissed alyeskas 
argument in the past 
leresche chided exxon shipping for its amateurish and 
bumbling attempt to monitor and assist skipper joseph hazelwood 
after his 1985 treatment for alcoholism 
the report also accused exxon shipping of failing to plan for 
crew rest and alertness on trips from valdez trying to reduce 
manning levels aboard tankers with little regard for crew safety 
and failing to provide the ships officers with needed management 
skills and a stable work force 
as for hazelwood the report said his judgment was impaired at 
the time of the accident he left the bridge when he should have 
been on it and he endangered the ship further after the grounding by 
trying to free the exxon valdez from a reef 
hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanor and three 
felony crimes and is scheduled to stand trial this fall hazelwood 
pleaded innocent to all charges 
the state report includes 13 recommendations for the ntsb 
including increased drug and alcohol testing for tanker crew members 
and enhanced navigational aids in prince william sound

traces of radiation were found in the air 
filter of a norwegian ship that shadowed a stricken soviet nuclear 
submarine near the norwegian coast scientists said today 
the tiny amount of radioactive iodine 131 could have been left 
over from a previous accident or other ships that the norwegian 
vessel trailed said researcher gunnar saxeboel of the norwegian 
institute on radiation hygiene 
soviet officials had denied radioactivity was released from the 
alfaclass sub that surfaced sunday and released clouds of black 
smoke 75 miles east of the norwegian coast in the barents sea and 30 
miles north of soviet territorial waters 
norwegian officials thought the smoke was from a fire but moscow 
said it came from auxiliary diesel engines the sub had to start up 
after a short circuit in a battery forced the shutdown of the 
reactor 
preliminary tests dont prove any radioactivity that can be 
traced to the submarine reactor said a statement from the 
institute but it did not rule out the submarine as the source 
water samples from the area proved free of radiation 
the filter may have been on the ship for a long time and the 
amount of radiation is so small that there is no danger of 
contamination said saxeboel 
saxeboel speculated the isotope could have come from a soviet 
power plant on the kola pennisula or from another soviet ship 
the norwegian ship the mariatta was in the norwegian sea on 
june 26 when a fire broke out on another soviet submarine the 
soviet tass news agency reported four sailors suffered radiation 
poisoning but later said the four were healthy 
norway complained of soviet tardiness in reporting three 
accidents aboard soviet nuclear submarines near its shores in less 
than four months 
the supreme commander of the soviet fleet adm vladimir 
chernavin said in an interview published in the soviet newspaper 
pravda today that warnings will be promptly issued in the future 
the norwegian news agency ntb reported from moscow 
if there ever is a problem with radiation information will 
immediately be provided the admiral was quoted as saying

accusing japan of colluding with chinas 
dictatorial government and plotting an economic invasion a 
chinese group has threatened to kill two japanese in china each 
month japans embassy said today 
the previously unknown group which calls itself the bloodbright 
dare to die squad sent a letter written in chinese to japan 
airlines beijing office and said the killings would start aug 15 
the letter concluded please tell other countries if they 
collude with the dictatorial government they will meet the same 
fate japan airlines which received the letter monday afternoon 
released copies of it today 
the antigovernment tone suggested the group might be linked to 
students whose nationwide prodemocracy protests were crushed by the 
army in beijing and by police in other cities students and 
supporters in many cities formed dare to die squads during the 
democracy movement 
police rounding up participants in the seven weeks of protests 
arrested a leading journalist dai qing and yang wei a recently 
freed dissident linked to a new yorkbased chinese group 
the husband of ms dai contacted by telephone said plainclothes 
police came to their home thursday during dinner and led her away 
saying they wanted to talk to her he said he had not heard from her 
since 
the official xinhua news agency said shanghai police arrested 
yang on today on charges of conducting demagogical propaganda for 
counterrevolutionary ends yang 33 was jailed from 1987 until 
january on similar charges 
several western embassies said there were no reports of other 
companies japanese or nonjapanese receiving threats from the 
chinese group 
we dont know how serious this is said hideo watanabe first 
secretary of the japanese embassy he said the embassy contacted 
beijing police and planned a meeting with them later today 
communist china has no known terrorist organizations although 
sporadic acts of sabotage are reported from time to time and usually 
are attributed to disgruntled individuals 
official controls and supervision extend to many aspects of daily 
life making it difficult for underground groups to operate 
but there has been speculation since the army killed hundreds of 
unarmed civilians june 4 in running student protesters out of 
central beijing that some of protesters would turn to underground 
activity 
when dynamite exploded on a shanghaibound train june 26 killing 
24 people authorities said they suspected sabotage results of a 
police investigation have not been released 
a japan airlines official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he believed the letter writers real target was the chinese 
government not japan i think the person selected japan airlines 
because it is comparatively famous he said he said he did not 
believe the threat would be carried out 
however he said it was up to the airlines head office and the 
embassy to decide if any safety precautions should be taken 
the letter written in blocklike almost childish characters 
said 
because the japanese pirates collude with the communist party 
dictatorial government and plot to launch a largescale economic 
invasion of china from today we the bloodbright dare to die 
squad enter into a state of war with the japanese pirates 
it said if japan did not repent we will kill one japanese 
pirate in china each week the group said its targets would be 
businessmen tourists and friends of the chinese communist party 
students journalists and diplomats and their families were 
exempt the letter said it made no specific demands 
watanabe said there are about 1000 japanese living in beijing 
about half the number before the june army attack on the protesters 
many foreigners fled china in the following days 
some japanese businessmen have returned since but most say they 
are reluctant to put more money into china the japanese government 
has halted highlevel contacts with china and frozen development aid 
few japanese tourists have returned 
in the only other known case of a terrorist threat being made 
against foreign nationals chinese authorities told the us embassy 
in june 1988 that nationals of an unidentified third country planned 
a terrorist attack on americans in beijing 
the embassy issued an alert but lifted it three days later when 
the chinese said the danger was over no details of the threat were 
ever made public

a fundamentalist guerrilla group today 
acknowledged killing at least some fighters of a rival faction after 
reports it ambushed and executed 30 fighters of the competing force 
rebel sources said the two groups are locked in a power struggle 
that could hinder efforts to overthrow the sovietbacked afghan 
government 
reacting monday to the earlier reports of the killings on july 9 
in takhar province about 140 miles north of kabul bush 
administration officials deplored the attack but said us support 
to the afghan guerrillas would remain intact 
our commitment to support the mujahedeen is very clear and the 
nature and character of our support is unchanged and it will 
continue said state department spokesman richard boucher the 
guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
the dead including seven key commanders belonged to the 
fundamentalist jamiateislami guerrilla group jamiateislami said 
the ambush was carried out by the rival hezbeislami group which 
is led by gulbaddin hekmatyar 
jamiat spokesman said mohammad shaoib said five people were 
killed in the ambush and 25 others were later executed spokesman 
qaribur rehman saeed of the hezbeislami group denied anyone was 
executed but he acknowledged at least some of the killings 
saeed did not say how many guerrillas were killed and he said 
his group was still investigating what happened 
hekmatyar is a hardline antiamerican fundamentalist despite 
his antius stand the united states has backed him and other 
guerrilla commanders who are trying to overthrow president najibs 
government in afghanistan 
the struggle for power between the guerrillas has been waged 
almost since the outset of the decadeold war it has left scores of 
afghan rebels from both groups dead guerrilla sources said today 
the forces killed in the latest attack were from afghanistans 
northern provinces of badakhshan kunduz takhar and baghlan they 
were returning from a strategy meeting with jamiat commander atmad 
shah masood said shaoib 
shaoib gave no details of the attack or executions 
it is a great loss for all afghanistan especially for the 
north he said 
in the northern provinces there are only two powers jamiat 
and hezb said saeed many of our commanders have been killed by 
masoods people 
masood formed a northern council to incorporate guerrillas 
belonging to the seven rebel parties with headquarters in pakistans 
border city of peshawar in a message to his headquarters in 
pakistan more than one year ago masood said he was consolidating 
forces and establishing an islamic army 
saeed said the conflict started right from the beginning when 
masood wanted the upper hand in the north 
masood wanted to clear the area of hezb mujahedeen he said 
he said had masood agreed to temporary ceasefires with soviet 
troops during their nine years of afghan military intervention 
ending in february rival clashes broke out when hezbeislami 
forces refused to recognize those arrangements said saeed 
another rebel source who spoke on condition of anonmity said 
both the sides are greedy they want more and more control 
rebel sources independent of either group speaking on condition 
of anonymity said they fear the latest round of killings could 
cripple guerrilla efforts to gain control of governmentcontrolled 
cities in the north 
sources within jamiat said masoods strategy has been to 
concentrate on northern cities particularly kunduz baghlan and 
badakhshan 
a moderate rebel who spoke on condition anonymity said masoods 
troops could not approach the afghan capital kabul even if they 
wanted because they are blocked by hezbeislami forces in central 
parwan province 
in stockholm sweden officials said today that senior us and 
soviet officials will meet there on july 31 for talks on afghanistan 
swedish news reports said the talks likely will focus on us and 
soviet arms supplies to the opposing sides in the civil war

officials said more talks are planned 
between the government and opposition despite the governments 
insistence that gen manuel antonio noriega will not step down 
the two sides announced an agenda monday after the first meeting 
to include military representatives since the may 7 election that 
intensified the countrys political crisis 
diplomats from the organization of american states who arranged 
and were mediating the talks were to leave today for washington on 
wednesday they report to the oas on the progress of their effort 
negotiations will resume when opposition representatives return 
from the oas meeting a government representative said 
noriega who chief of the defense forces and de facto leader of 
the country did not attend the monday meeting instead he attended 
a session of the state council which is studying a proposal for 
forming a junta after sept 1 when the civilian governments term 
ends 
asked about the countrys political situation he said nothing 
but reached into the seat of his car and smiling took out a police 
club and waved it at journalists 
in addition to noriegas departure as chief of the panamanian 
defense forces the opposition agenda includes defining what is 
meant by transfer of power the elections which international 
observers say the opposition won by a 31 margin and human rights 
violations 
government and military representatives listed an end to us 
aggression and military threats against panama withdrawal of 
additional us troops sent to panama an end to economic aggression 
and return of panamanian funds held by the united states strict 
compliance with the 1977 panama canal treaties and no us 
interference in panamanian political affairs 
under the treaties panama is to take full control of the canal 
at the end of 1999 
international observers say noriega rigged the presidential 
election in favor of his candidate carlos duque and had it 
annulled when the fraud and opposition victory became obvious 
the opposition and the united states have insisted for a year and 
a half that noriega step down as chief of defense forces noriega 
refuses 
noriega was indicted in the united states on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges but he denies the charges and says they 
are part of a us attempt to retain control of the canal 
as part of its effort to force noriega to leave the united 
states froze panamanian government deposits in us banks barred 
payments to the panamanian government and increased its military 
strength in the canal zone

a nuclear plant supervisor who deliberately 
drank lemonade laced with radioactive material is under 
investigation but officials said today they had no ready 
explanation for the act 
the dose of radioactive material swallowed by the supervisor at 
the james a fitzpatrick plant was not lifethreatening and was 
equal to the amount of radiation in five chest xrays officials 
said he didnt require hospitalization or medical treatment 
there are a lot of questions unanswered and we are attempting 
to get the answers said cliff spieler spokesman for the new york 
power authority which runs the plant 
the authority released a statement monday saying the worker told 
investigators that he had put radioactive material in a bottle of 
lemonade before drinking the liquid spieler refused to say what 
reason the man gave 
the supervisor was idenitified by the power authority only as a 
worker for institute of resource management a maryland company 
under contract to provide shortterm workers at the lake ontario 
plant 
wayne schmidt senior resident inspector for the us nuclear 
regulatory commission said he was a radiation supervisor on the 
plants refuel floor an area where fuel is loaded and unloaded from 
the reactor 
a radiation detector alerted officials to the presence of

president bush won praise from 
dutch government officials today for his knowledge of european 
affairs mixed with criticism from an opposition leader over the 
environment and other issues 
duth foreign minister hans van den broek said the first visit by 
an american president to the netherlands had established a new 
marker in the two centuries of close ties between the two 
countries 
joep de boer a parliamentarian for premier ruud lubbers 
christian democratic appeal party called bush the most european 
oriented president there has been for years 
bush conferred with 11 dutch politicians over breakfast before 
departing for washington at the end of his fournation 10day trip 
to europe 
bush also met privately for 30 minutes before breakfast with 
dutch opposition leader wim kok leader of the opposition labor 
party and a likely winner of elections scheduled for sept 6 
aboard air force one bush told reporters the dutch politicians 
had expressed strong views on the environment and other issues that 
at times bordered on argument 
kok told reporters after the meeting that he had argued for 
ussoviet negotiations on elemininating both superpowers arsenals 
of shortrange nuclear missiles 
kok also criticized bush for not endorsing a dutch government 
plan to enlist united nations help in setting up monitoring rules to 
protect the atmospheres delicate ozone layer 
the attitude of the americans towards strenghtening the united 
nations in environmental matters is too reluctant said kok 
during his dutch visit bush reiterated the nato position that 
the allies must first press for substantial reductions in 
conventional troops and weaponry in europe before seeking a treaty 
with the soviets on shortrange nuclear weapons 
as regards his attitude towards the soviet union bush is more 
cautious then we are we can do a lot more to give the process 
of economic and political reform a chance said kok whose party 
helped orchestrate nationwide opposition to basing 48 usbuilt 
cruise missiles on dutch soil in the early 1980s 
although the lubbers government decided to go ahead with the 
plan the missiles never came because of the 1987 ussoviet pact 
to ban all intermediate range nuclear wapons 
van den broek in a radio interview called the bush visit 
extremely gratifying and successful 
in the uninterrupted relations between our two countries this 
is a new marker in a long era of mutual friendship the foreign 
minister said 
joris voorhoeve leader of the rightwing liberals junior 
partner in the coalition government said bush had offered the 
american prescription of lower taxes to speed up economic growth 
as a cure for the netherlands economic woes 
although dutch economic growth is above average for the 12 
nations of the european economic community the nation still suffers 
a crippling 14percent unemployment rate 
de boer his partys foreign affairs spokesman said he had 
warned the president about the resurgence of nationalism in west 
germany im totally reassured they are aware of the problem

communist leader wojciech jaruzelski 
reversed himself today and said he will be a candidate for 
president which the national assembly is to elect wednesday 
also today bus and tram drivers in the countrys most populous 
province of katowice went on strike for higher pay a sign of 
growing public dissatisfaction with the beleaguered economy a new 
president will face 
gen jaruzelski had declared june 30 that he was not a candidate 
saying he was too closely linked to the 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
that attempted to crush solidarity and not closely enough with 
democratic changes now sweeping poland 
he proposed the candidacy of a longtime loyalist interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak but communist leaders asked jaruzelski to 
reconsider and he appeared in the last few weeks to be leaning 
toward running 
a victory hinges on how whether the communist coalition which 
has a majority of the seats in the national assembly will stand 
behind its leader 
the presidency whose powers include control of the military and 
foreign relations was a result of governmentsolidarity talks in 
the spring the negotiations also brought elections in june in which 
solidarity candidates were limited to winning a minority number of 
seats in the national assembly 
on monday jaruzelski met with solidarity lawmakers and submitted 
to nearly six hours of questioning in an attempt to win votes 
but as the solidarity delegation convened this afternoon to 
decide how to vote the opposition lawmakers indicated they doubted 
there would be any support among them for jaruzelski 
i feel he is responsible for all of the mistakes he is 
responsible so i cannot support him said zofia kuratowska a 
deputy speaker of the senate 
the new president will seat a government that must deal with 
worsening consumer shortages and inflation that based on a new 
statistics for the first six months of 1989 appears headed for an 
annual rate of 160 percent 
the vote wednesday is to be a roll call which should make it 
easier for coalition leaders to insist that each lawmaker vote for 
jaruzelski 
the staterun pap news agency said jaruzelski announcing his 
candidacy today at a meeting of communist lawmakers said he was 
driven by a sense of duty in heeding the urging of party leaders 
that he run 
to win approval jaruzelski would need the votes of nearly all 
coalition lawmakers because the coalition holds a 54 percent 
majority in the national assembly the president is to be chosen by 
a simple majority during a joint session of the 100member senate 
and 460member sejm 
some members of the communist and affliiated peasant party were 
elected to in junes balloting with solidarity support and it is not 
clear if they could support a jaruzelski candidacy 
under the april agreement that reinstated solidarity the free 
trade union movement was only allowed to field candidates for 46 
percent of the 560 seats in the twochamber assembly it won all but 
one of those seats 
on friday solidarity chief lech walesa said he would cooperate 
with jaruzelski if the general is elected he said political 
conditions require that the president come from within the communist 
coalition 
there are fears that a noncommunist president would provoke a 
dangerous reaction from hardliners at home and elsewhere in the 
soviet bloc 
solidarity lawmakers who met with him on monday said jaruzelski 
did not sufficiently repudiate the 1981 crackdown or polands 
participation in the 1968 sovietled invasion that crushed prague 
spring reforms in czechoslovakia 
jaruzelski was defense minister at the time he has led poland 
for 8 years and this year presided over the reinstatement of 
soldarity under a revamped constitution the new president is to 
serve up to two sixyear terms 
senator karol modzelewski of wroclaw speaking for the solidarity 
lawmakers stressed monday that walesas endorsement of jaruzelski 
does not mean they feel bound to vote for the general 
it appeared virtually certain that the solidarity group would 
feel bound to somehow register their dissatisfaction with jaruzelski 
walesas statement and words of praise for jaruzelski from 
president bush during his trip to poland july 911 are considered to 
have helped persuade jaruzelski to run 
if jaruzelski becomes president he said monday he would give up 
the post of party chief according to solidarity lawmakers

the detroit symphony orchestra says it will be 
unable to pay regular biweekly salaries to 155 employees this week

symphony chairman robert s miller announced monday there was 
no way the orchestra would be able to come up with the 200000

could issue oneweek paychecks symphony finance committee chairman 
alfred r glancy iii said he expected to learn today if that was 
possible 
miller said last month that the symphony would close in midjuly 
unless the state city and businesses pledged 182 million for the

since then state city and corporate leaders have given hopeful 
signs of additional funding but no hard commitments spokeswoman 
mary loiselle said today 
we have made a lot of progress and we are encouraged by that 
lioselle said but in the mean time the cash is running out

flag burner gregory johnson will have 
succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his fetid imagination if 
the nation adopts a flagburning amendment shrinking basic rights a 
constitutional scholar testified today 
he will have succeeded in making the greatest nation on earth 
if we give him this amendment look just a little silly a little 
less brave and a little less free said walter e dellinger iii of 
duke university law school 
he testified at the beginning of two days of hearings by the 
house judiciary committees constitutional law subcommittee on the 
bush administrations proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag 
burning 
dellinger said the nation should beware of any stampede toward an 
amendment curtailing the rights of dissidents he said many 
americans have tolerated freedom of speech when it was painful to do 
so and changing the system now would be unfair to them 
johnson will have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his 
fetid imagination dellinger said 
johnson was arrested in dallas during the 1984 republican 
national convention following a protest that ended with 
demonstrators igniting an american flag authorities said was taken 
from a pole outside a bank building 
he denied he actually ignited the flag but said he approved the 
action and gave speeches during the protest he claimed he was 
singled out for prosecution because dallas police knew he was a 
member of the revolutionary communist youth brigade 
the supreme court threw out his conviction in ruling that flag 
burning is a form of free speech protected by the constitution 
in a statement at the outset of the hearing rep james f 
sensenbrenner jr rwis urged lawmakers to be serious and frame 
the issues as they are in reality whether we really want to carve 
an exception out fo the first amendment and hold our honored and 
revered flag above all else or whether we want to let the flag 
burners have their way 
a man who might have made the ruling come out differently if the 
senate had not rejected his nomination to the supreme court is 
scheduled to testify on wednesday 
robert bork has said he would have upheld the texas statute if he 
were on the court the man who took the seat bork would have had 
anthony kennedy provided the fifth vote in the 54 majority that 
overturned the flag ruling 
bork who is now with a washington think tank contends congress 
must now go ahead with a constitutional amendment if it wants to 
overcome the courts decision 
theres near total agreement in congress that something must be 
done about the ruling however there are some mostly democrats 
who are hesitant to amend the constitution and especially in a way 
that restricts individual rights guaranteed by the first amendment 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash plans to bring a simple 
statute before the chamber before the august recess supporters of 
that approach hope the issue which seemed so urgent at the time of 
the court decision as the fourth of july holiday approached will 
fade 
however president bush is behind a constitutional amendment that 
has already been introduced in the house by minority leader bob 
michel rill and that senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
planned to introduce in the senate 
many democrats remembering last years presidential campaign in 
which bush visited a flag factory fear that voting against the 
constitutional amendment will let republicans portray them in the 
next election as somehow less patriotic 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine last week 
promised that both the statute and the constitutional amendment 
would see senate action he and dole have agreed to hold those votes 
in october

the cambodian resistance says next 
weeks peace negotiations may fail because vietnam refuses to 
resolve key issues and looks upon talks as part of the war and not 
part of the search for peace 
hopes for a settlement are the brightest yet because the warring 
factions have agreed to meet in paris on july 2425 and join an 
international conference with the five permanent members of the un 
security council five days later 
a guerrilla radio broadcast monday however said success hinged 
on vietnams sincerity and mentioned recent historical lessons 
a text seen tuesday said vietnams wars with france and the 
united states showed that it always considered the negotiating 
stage as part of the war and not part of the search for peace as 
expected by the rest of the world 
one thing is indisputable not even once has vietnam respected 
any negotiated agreements the broadcast said 
the vietnamese refuse to work out a comprehensive settlement on 
the futures of the vietnamesesponsored government in cambodia and 
the khmer rouge the largest guerrilla group and oppose deployment 
of a peacekeeping force the broadcast said 
vietnam loudly states that it wants peace more than anything 
else but vietnam blocks every key leading to this peace the 
radio said vietnams odious goal would always be to use the 
negotiating stage as a forum to gain some reprieve at a time 
when its economy is moribound in this case we of the cambodian 
resistance will fight on 
three guerrilla groups oppose vietnams decadeold occupation of 
cambodia the khmer rouge khmer peoples national liberation front 
and the forces of prince norodom sihanouk former ruler of cambodia 
vietnam invaded in december 1978 ousting the brutal khmer rouge 
regime led by pol pot and the civil war began after the vietnamese 
installed a new government in phnom penh the next month hanoi has 
pledged to have all its military forces out of the country by the 
end of september 
a central issue for negotiators in paris is the future role of 
the khmer rouge who killed hundreds of thousands of people when 
they ruled cambodia from the end of the indochina war in april 1975 
until the vietnamese invasion 
premier hun sens government has rejected resistance demands that 
the khmer rouge be included in a provisional coalition government 
cambodias official news agency spk said fiveday international 
conference on the phenomenon of genocide and the prevention of the 
genocidal pol potists return to power in cambodia would begin

a yugoslav minister told a conference 
of evangelical christians on tuesday that efforts to spread their 
faith have been hindered by the scandalous behavior of american 
television preachers 
another speaker warned that tv preaching often fails to strike a 
responsive chord among audiences in underdeveloped countries 
during a speech to the conference peter kuzmic director of the 
biblijskoteolofski institut in osijek yugoslavia said evangelists 
must lead by example and that the integrity of their movement will 
enhance the gospel or discredit and hinder it 
this is illustrated by the recent scandalous behavior and 
related worldwide negative publicity of prominent american tv 
evangelists and other evangelical leaders kuzmic said 
these scandals show what the cheap gospel related to dollars 
rather than rooted in christ does and how it links with the 
sinful human nature kuzmic said 
the yugoslav did not mention names but he appeared to be 
referring to scandals involving american evangelists jimmy swaggart 
and jim bakker 
american evangelists have used television extensively to build 
worldwide followings and multimilliondollar corporate empires 
but philemon choi secretarygeneral of breakthrough ministries 
of hong kong said heavy use of satellite and television 
communications which only the rich can afford may lead the 
evangelical movement into the trap of insensitivity to culture 
while modern communication technology has its glamor and power 
in terms of touching millions at a time we should not forget that 
in twothirds of the world many people still consider radio sets a 
luxury he said 
choi said the appeal of evangelical christianity as presented by 
tv preachers evaporates once the television is turned off 
we must remember that the tears of the tv evangelist is no 
substitute for the weeping of the wounded and the electronic 
church is no substitute for the true christian community life he 
added 
the lausanne ii conference has brought together about 4200 
evangelical christians from 191 countries to discuss ways to spread 
their faith around the world 
it was organized by the lausanne committee chaired by the rev 
leighton ford a canadian who lives in north carolina he is a 
brotherinlaw of billy graham the famous american evangelist and 
pioneer in television preaching

vice president dan quayle predicted the 
supreme courts recent ruling on abortion will focus debate not on 
whether abortions should be legal but under what circumstances they 
should be performed 
most people in america support the right of a woman to have an 
abortion quayle said monday at a breakfast with reporters but 
thats not going to be the argument the argument is going to 
be how are the abortions going to be performed in this country 
quayle on a california tour and campaign stop for republican 
sen pete wilsons gubernatorial bid said he foresees such future 
restrictions as parental consent required for minors bans on 
abortions in public hospitals and bans on abortions performed solely 
because the fetus a woman is carrying is not the sex she wanted 
the supreme court ruling in webster vs reproductive health 
services earlier this month granted more authority to the states to 
regulate abortions 
quayle who said he personally favors abortion only if a womans 
life is in danger said a socalled human life amendment is 
likely to be approved by congress such a constitutional amendment 
would let states decide if abortions should be legal 
quayle said president bush would support such a measure 
quayles remarks drew criticism from those on both sides of the 
issue 
democratic consultant ann lewis suggested the vice president was 
trying to boost the republican partys appeal to voters who believe 
women have a right to have abortions 
susan carpentermcmillan the spokeswoman for the los angeles 
chapter of right to life responded read our lips we will not 
accept a change in the prolife policy from the bush 
administration 
later in the day quayle told the western governors association 
meeting in long beach the nation needs to renew its enthusiasm for 
the space program and chart a course for the future that includes 
manned space exploration

administration 
the letter commended bush for meeting with south african 
archbishop desmond tutu and other opponents of the racial policies 
of the south african government 
as for bushs meeting with de klerk congressmen said they 
opposed such a session unless the south african government took 
these steps

president bush flying home from a 
10day trip to europe today said leaders in poland and hungary have 
too much hope for their economic and democratic reforms to fear 
a soviet backlash 
i was struck by the tears i saw in almost every place bush 
said of the thousands who greeted him on his fournation journey 
across both sides of the iron curtain 
earlier bidding farewell to us officials at the embassy in the

political book my judgment has been vindicated said bush he 
is serious he is doing a firstclass job 
the president said he had no information to confirm a new york 
times report that us and soviet negotiators had reached agreement 
on key elements of a treaty banning chemical weapons 
it would be a pleasant surprise said bush adding that 
verification is what has thwarted an agreement all along 
id like to see that in writing before i get euphoric about 
it he said 
his chief of staff john sununu and national security adviser 
brent scwcroft also said they had no information on a chemical 
treaty breakthrough 
asked the highlight of his journey bush cited the moment in 
budapest on wednesday when prime minister miklos nemeth gave him a 
plaque with barbed wire from the recently dismantled fence along its 
western border 
when nemeth handed me that barbed wire that gets close to 
it he said 
recalling his reception from the crowds he encountered bush 
remarked i was struck by the tears i saw in almost every place 
but he said he was glad to be coming home i think things are 
going pretty well 
asked if the polish and hungarian leaders feared a backlash from 
the kremlin if they go too far on their reforms bush said 
theyre not dwelling on that theres too much hope too much 
optimism its still there but its overpowered by the moves going 
on there 
before queen beatrix of the netherlands saw him off at the 
airport bush met with dutch opposition leader wim kok and other 
parliamentary leaders for what he termed lively talks that at times 
bordered on argument over environmental and other issues 
everybody wants the united states to pick up the check for 
everything bush lamented but he said they understand we are 
not rolling in money because of our deficit 
with stops in 12 countries under his belt since jan 20 bush was 
heading home from the firstever visit to the netherlands by an 
american president after attending the sevennation economic summit 
in paris and visiting poland and hungary 
the highlight of his visit to the netherlands was a speech monday 
at pieterskerk a medieval church in nearby leiden where bush 
saluted moves toward political and economic reforms in eastern 
europe especially the soviet union poland and hungary 
and they know as we do that ultimately whatever the odds 
freedom will succeed bush said 
he said we must work together toward the day when all of 
europe east and west is free of discord free of division 
compared with his predecessors bush has been a whirlwind of 
motion both internationally and domestically since he came to 
power 
in his first six months as president ronald reagan ventured 
outside the country only once to neighboring canada 
jimmy carter visited only two countries england and switzerland 
in his first six months 
bush on the other hand went to canada three weeks after taking 
power 
he went to tokyo in february for the funeral of emperor hirohito 
and then made stops in china and south korea 
in may bush went to italy stopped in brussels belgium for a 
nato summit and continued to west germany and england 
bush also has been busy crisscrossing the united states the 
white house calculates he has visited 26 states since his 
inauguration 
and he wont be sitting still for long bush is expected to make 
a twoday trip beginning july 28 to chicago las vegas and tennessee 
in eight years as reagans vice president he toured almost 80

the rev jesse jackson confirmed tuesday that 
he is moving his legal residence to washington but again sidestepped 
questions about whether he will run for mayor 
mobbed by reporters after his appearance before a congressional 
subcommittee jackson who made unsuccessful bids for the democratic 
presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 said im not running for 
mayor of washington 
however when asked whether he would end all speculation by 
saying unequivocally that he would not join the 1990 race for mayor 
jackson said only that i will not bear the burden of your 
frustration 
pressed to explicitly state his plans jackson repeatedly changed 
the topic from the mayors race to the campaign for statehood for 
the district of columbia he said he was moving to the city to press 
for making the district a state and to work for other civil rights 
causes 
when asked if he was moving his legal residence here he said 
at some point we will 
such a move if it occurs at least a year before the nov 6 
1990 mayoral election would make him eligible for the race 
mayor marion barry has held the office since 1979 barrys aides 
said last week that he was running for reelection and expected 
jackson to support him 
jackson has owned a house since 1984 in the northwest section of 
the city but has resided in chicago where the rainbow coalition 
which he founded and still heads has had its headquarters 
the coalition is relocating to washington and jackson said he 
will be living here by sept 1 in order to become a legal resident 
he must change his voter registration or start paying city income 
taxes 
jacksons house which has been under renovation is not ready to 
be occupied in the meantime jackson has made arrangements to rent 
a threebedroom apartment in the district 
my opinion is that both the mayor and jackson are engaged in a 
holding pattern intended to keep other candidates for mayor off 
balance and to keep the financial supporters of other candidates off 
balance said charlene drewjarvis a member of the city council 
who has said she will announce her candidacy for mayor soon 
jackson said it was too soon to be concentrating on the mayors 
race the mayor has another year to serve he said 
focus on the mayors race is paralyzing the city he said 
the priority issue ought to be enfranchisement of the district of 
columbia 
other announced mayoral candidates include david clarke the 
council chairman john ray a member of the council and 
businesswoman sharon pratt dixon a former democratic national 
committee treasurer 
jackson was questioned by reporters after testifying in favor of 
legislation to expand the rights of the disabled his appearance was 
before the house committee on education and labor subcommittees on 
select education and employment opportunities

black nationalist leader nelson 
mandela says he will not be freed from prison this year his wife 
winnie reported after a fivehour birthday visit today 
his exact words were there will be no release definitely not 
this year mrs mandela told reporters outside the victor verster 
prison farm north of cape town 
the african national congress leader jailed for life for 
plotting against whiteminority rule observed his 71st birthday 
today with an unprecedented visit by 16 members of his family 
his july 5 meeting with president pw botha has sparked 
speculation that the government might release him after september 
parliamentary elections for whites indians and people of 
mixedrace the black majority of 28 million has no vote in national 
affairs 
subsequent statements by spokesmen for bothas national party 
suggested that the government was seeking a formula to free the anc 
leader as a prelude to possible whiteblack negotiations 
mrs mandela said that national party leader fw de klerk who 
is designated to succeed botha as president after the elections was 
fully aware of the july 1 meeting de klerk has not commented on 
it yet and observers in south africa had speculated that botha 
facing forced retirement took the action to upstage his successor 
mrs mandela said her husbands release has always been the last 
item on his agenda his own freedom is of no consequence it is 
the freedom of the people he went to prison for she said 
she said he had briefly touched on his meeting on friday with 
five african national congress colleagues who were sentenced with 
him in 1964 for founding and participating in activities of the 
ancs armed wing 
she said he told her there was no specific significance to that 
meeting but mrs mandela added whatever comrade mandela does is 
in full consultation with the leadership behind bars and the anc 
outside 
mrs mandela and her daughter zindzi wore black underlining 
the solemnity of the day that they had previously marked by fasting 
and praying at home some relatives came from the united states and 
mrs mandela said it was the first time mandelas extended family 
joined him since his arrest 
some family members wore symbols of the campaign for 
blackmajority rights 
a grandson was draped in a vivid garland of roses and carnations 
in yellow black and red colors of the united democratic front 
south africas main antiapartheid alliance before it was banned 
last year 
a son held up a fruit basket with ribbons in green black and 
yellow colors of the outlawed anc guerrilla movement 
about 20 supporters of mandela shouted viva anc and viva 
mandela as relatives arrived in five cars at the gates of the 
prison farm mandela was transferred there from a cape town prison 
after he recovered from tuberculosis last year 
wellwishers stood in the rain in nearfreezing temperatures on 
one of the coldest days in recent years 
mandela has been in prison since 1962 and he is serving a life 
term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government 
mrs mandela said she brought birthday cards and greetings from 
various antiapartheid groups including united democratic front 
affiliates and the national union of mineworkers

the church of englands proposals to allow the 
ordination of divorced men and of men married to divorced women were 
defeated in the house of commons on tuesday 
lawmakers voted 5145 to reject the proposals which had been 
approved by the general synod the churchs governing body and by 
the house of lords the unelected upper chamber of parliament 
approval by both house of parliament is needed for such measures 
affecting the state church to become law 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie the spiritual leader of 
the church of england and 70 millions anglicans worldwide supported 
the proposals hoping they would boost the declining number of 
clergy 
runcie said the experience of a failed marriage could help others 
facing a similar situation and called on parliament to lay stress 
on grace and forgiveness 
conservative lawmaker sir john stokes told the house of commons 
he feared the proposals would send out a wrong or confusing signal 
to ordinary people in england who are looking to the church and the 
clergy to set high standards 
debate on the proposals was delayed until early tuesday by 
several other items of parliamentary business the government wants 
to clear up before the summer recess begins july 28 by then many 
of the 650 members of parliament had gone home 
lord hailsham britains former chief legal officer called the 
vote unrepresentative and foolish 
you cant test a mans vocation to become a priest by a 
majority in parliament it has to be done by the church 
authorities he said 
the ban on ordination for remarried divorced men or those whose 
spouses have been divorced has long been regarded as an anomaly in 
the church of england because ordained clergy can be divorced 
without losing their posts

the government said tuesday the us trade 
deficit widened sharply to 1024 billion in may as america brought 
in record imports sold less goods abroad and lost ground in its bid 
to shrink the trade gap 
mays imbalance was the biggest in five months and represented a 
236 percent increase over the 829 billion deficit registered in 
april when the nation had its smallest monthly trade gap in more 
than four years 
analysts predicted aprils figure was the low point for the year 
and said mays increase dealt a blow to hopes that the us trade 
deficit would improve significantly this year 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher called the latest report 
disappointing but said he was encouraged by the continuing 
strength of exports which declined slightly in may from a record 
high in april 
us trade representative carla hills said the report was 
consistent with our expectation that the trade deficit will 
continue to improve at a modest pace in 1989 
for the first five months of the year the trade gap was running 
at an annual rate of 1111 billion compared with an actual 1988 
deficit of 11853 billion last years figure was a 221 percent 
improvement over 1987 
the trade deficit over time and on average is improving but 
only slowly said economist allen sinai of the boston co we are 
light years away from anything resembling balance in our trade 
the nations best chance for trade improvement probably awaits 
a significant turn for the worse in the us economy which would 
cause american businesses and consumers to purchase fewer imports 
he said 
in may imports shot up 43 percent to a record 4071 billion 
boosted by a big increase in americas foreign oil bill and stronger 
spending on foreign agricultural products capital goods and 
industrial supplies 
petroleum imports surged 173 percent to 475 billion as both 
the price and volume of foreign oil purchases rose the average 
price for a barrel of oil rose for the sixth straight month and 
reached 1840 in may the volume of oil imports rose for the second 
straight month to 833 million barrels a day 
exports meanwhile dropped off 09 percent to 3047 billion 
reflecting slower foreign demand for us products in almost every 
major catogory led by a 57 percent drop in purchases of 
americanmade consumer goods 
analysts said exports are likely to decline further as the 
strength of the us dollar against other currencies increases the 
price of american goods on foreign markets 
economist michael evans head of a washington consulting firm 
said mays trade figure in part represented a bounceback from an 
artificially low april deficit but he predicted the monthly trade 
figures are likely to gradually increase for the rest of the year 
i wouldnt say this was just a fluke or that its going to get 
better again evans said we are going to see pretty sluggish 
exports this year and that is the result of the higher dollar 
bruce steinberg economist for merrill lynch capital markets in 
new york said the united states might make some modest progress on 
the trade gap later this year if the nations slowing economy pulls 
in fewer imports but nothing like the 34 billion improvement 
recorded in 1988 
i would describe the trade environment as intractable 
steinberg said its difficult to get a lot more improvement than 
weve seen 
the latest report showed increases in the us trade imbalances 
with most major trading partners 
as usual the united states posted its largest trade deficit in 
may with japan a 428 billion shortfall that was up from 389 
billion in april the nation posted a small 783 million deficit 
with western europe after registering surpluses in both march and 
april 
the imbalance with canada the largest us trading partner was 
7393 million in may up from 1748 million in april other large 
deficits in may were recorded with taiwan 109 billion south 
korea 503 million and mexico 452 million

the superpowers have made some recent progress 
toward a global treaty banning chemical weapons but the chief us 
negotiator in the talks today said there is no reason to be 
euphoric 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the united 
states and the soviet union have reached agreement on key elements 
of a draft treaty that would ban the development production 
possession and transfer of chemical weapons 
ambassador max friedersdorf the head of the us delegation to 
the geneva conference told the associated press that some progress 
was made in the latest round of ussoviet talks but thats a 
long way from completing a treaty 
friedersdorf said the two sides agreed to a document on spot 
inspections of chemical weapons sites and the paper has been sent 
to washington for approval 
but he called the issue just one aspect of the verification 
problem referring to the complex anticheating provisions widely 
considered to be the most difficult issue in negotiations that began 
more than 20 years ago 
he also said agreement was reached earlier on a paper involving 
exchange of data of the two superpopwers before the conclusion of a 
treaty but that there were still fundamental differences on when 
this information should be exchanged 
verification involves a lot more than the conduct of a 
challenge inspection and bilateral data exchange friedersdorf 
said i dont think there is any reason to be euphoric 
the new york times quoted a state department official as saying 
that the two sides had agreed in principle on a mathematical 
formula prescribing the amounts and types of chemical weapons to 
be destroyed over a 10year period but president bush national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and white house chief of staff john 
sununu all said they had no information to confirm the times report 
id like to see that reported agreement in writing before i 
get euphoric about it bush told reporters aboard air force one en 
route home from europe this morning it would be a pleasant 
surprise 
he said the problem of verifying compliance with the treaty is 
what has thwarted an agreement all along 
the united states and the soviet union have the largest arsenals 
of such weapons 
the geneva protocol of 1925 adopted after poison gas in world 
war i produced 13 million casualties prohibits the use of chemical 
weapons but not their manufacture or stockpiling 
discussions on a chemical weapons treaty have been conducted on 
and off in geneva for eight years 
the 40 members of the disarmament conferene include iran egypt 
and morocco twentyeight observers to the conference include iraq 
syria and libya 
soviet authorities say they have no more than 55000 tons of 
chemical warfare agents but western intelligence agencies estimate 
they might have as much as 300000 tons

leaders of the governing liberal democratic party 
plagued by scandals and unpopular policies gave bleak predictions 
for this weekends elections for the upper chamber of parliament 
prime minister sosuke uno his image damaged by reports of a 
relationship with a geisha planned his first election appearances 
outside the capital since the campaign began 
i feel we hit bottom on saturday party secretarygeneral 
ryutaro hashimoto told reporters since then things have been 
looking up but i cant say there has been a change in the 
overall mood 
hashimoto said liberal democratic candidates have been hurt by 
public anger over the recruit influencebuying scandal which forced 
unos predecessor noboru takeshita to resign june 2 and by a new 
3 percent consumption tax which the party backed 
hashimoto the partys no 2 leader after uno refused to comment 
on public opinion polls and media forecasts that suggest his party 
will suffer a major loss of seats in the 252member upper chamber in 
the election sunday 
but the masscirculation mainichi shimbun newspaper tuesday 
quoted senior party member michio watanabe as predicting the party 
will win only 37 of the 126 contested upper house seats falling 
short of the 54 it needs to win to maintain a majority 
watanabe reportedly said the party will be defeated in rural 
areas where moves to open up japans agricultural markets have 
alienated farmers traditionally an important source of the partys 
support 
the liberal democrats who have dominated japanese politics since 
1955 hold 66 of the contested seats and 73 more which are not up 
for reelection until 1992 the leading opposition socialist party 
has 43 upper house seats 11 of which are being contested 
a serious setback at the polls could force uno to resign 
although he has said he hopes to remain in office until his term as 
party president expires oct 31 due to the partys majorities in 
both houses of parliament the party president concurrently serves 
as prime minister 
after unos return tuesday from the paris economic summit party 
officials said he is scheduled to travel to osaka in western japan 
for his first electionrelated appearance outside tokyo since the 
upper house campaigns began july 5 
party leaders have distanced uno from campaigns because of 
reports he paid a geisha to be his mistress for several months in 
1985 uno has denied doing anything immoral 
in osaka uno will speak at a local university and travel to 
nearby kyoto for meetings with business leaders on thursday he 
will visit his home constituency in saga prefecture also in western 
japan 
unos wife chiyo will attend a liberal democratic womens rally 
in yokohama just south of tokyo on wednesday a local party 
official said mrs uno has avoided comment on the geisha scandal 
but in one interview said she trusts her husband 
due to fears the sex scandal would cost votes the partys tokyo 
chapter asked uno to stay away from campaigns for the tokyo 
metropolitan assembly earlier this month at one rally he did 
attend party supporters scuffled with women carrying 
antiprostitution placards and calling for him to resign 
when campaigns for the upper house seats began uno gave only a 
short speech in the parking lot of the partys tokyo headquarters 
before leaving for paris where he attended bicentennial ceremonies 
of the french revolution and the threeday summit meeting of major 
industrialized countries uno made no campaign appearances and party 
spokesmen said his future schedule had not been decided 
in the recruit co scandal the publishing conglomerate sold 
stock at cutrate prices to politicians and bureaucrats it hoped to 
influence stockholders made handsome profits after the stock went

an attorney defending korean air lines on 
tuesday disputed an international investigation of flight 007 which 
found the plane was significantly off course for hours before it was 
destroyed by the soviet union 
in opening statements in a civil jury trial george tompkins 
refused to concede that the kal jumbo jet was off track so early it 
was blown out of the sky over soviet air space in 1983 by a 
heatseeking missile killing all 269 people aboard 
the best evidence is that the crew of the kal jumbo jet was 
flying its correct route until shortly before it was destroyed on 
sept 1 1983 tompkins said 
tompkins said the crew sent radioed position reports periodically 
to anchorage alaska and tokyo pinpointing the planes location as 
being on course for the first four hours of its flight 
us air traffic controllers who tracked the earliest parts of 
flight 007 before it went out of radar range reported nothing 
abnormal tompkins said 
families of 132 of the passengers killed when flight 007 was 
destroyed are suing kal alleging willful misconduct by the planes 
crew and seeking to collect in excess of a 75000perpassenger 
limit in damages imposed under international treaty 
the last radioed position report in which the crew said it was 
on course over the north pacific was about an hour before the plane 
was shot down 
what happened after that only the soviet union can answer 
because its radar tracked the kal 747 and it was soviet planes that 
shadowed the jumbo jet and destroyed it said tompkins 
it certainly was willful misconduct on the part of the 
russians the lawyer for kal said 
the international civil aviation organization which probed the 
disaster concluded that flight 007 was off course for nearly 5 
hours and intruded into soviet territory for several hours before it 
was shot down with at least one heatseeking missile from a soviet 
fighter plane the reports conclusions were based on data from the 
us government japan and the soviet union 
tompkins labeled as theory conjecture speculation the 
explanation offered by families of the dead passengers that the 
planes crew knew it was off course shortly after leaving anchorage 
alaska due to an error in programming a computerized navigation 
system aboard the craft 
tompkins said there was no proof of any programming error by the 
crew 
the threemember crew didnt want to turn back to correct the 
problem because it would have had to dump much of the planes fuel 
and face disciplinary action suggest lawyers for families of the 
victims therefore the crew may have sent incorrect position 
reports and navigated without the use of the shipboard computer 
system the families lawyers have suggested 
flight 007s crew literally ran four straight red lights by 
being off course at various position checkpoints donald madole an 
attorney for the families told the jury 
the plane was more than 300 miles off track when it was shot 
down said milton sincoff who also represents the families 
how could an airplane get 300 miles off course if they were 
following procedures asked madole 
tompkins said that if the highly experienced crew aboard flight 
007 had made an error in programming the pilots navigation system 
it would been aware of it immediately 
tompkins disputed the families contention that the plane would 
have had to return to anchorage alaska to correct the problem 
saying you can update it in the air a crew member would simply 
have to reach up and throw a switch to a second automatic 
pilot and the plane would have turned and gone back on the 
course tompkins said 
kal lawyers have asked us district judge aubrey robinson to 
limit presentation of the conclusions of the icao report on the 
shootdown robinson said he would decide as the trial progresses 
what material from the report may be introduced he said any 
analysis from the report the families lawyers want to present to 
the jury must be buttressed by an adequate factual foundation 
numerous pieces of wreckage from flight 007 were recovered in the 
sea of japan in the days following the shootdown but the cockpit 
voice recorder and flight data recorder were never pulled up from 
the submerged wreckage of the plane

progress is about to claim another piece 
of history the states last crank telephone system and cut off 18 
customers who live in the rugged salmon river canyon from the 
outside world 
but the north fork telephone corp customers strung along 31 
miles of the wilderness river in isolated central idaho are not 
going to give up without a struggle 
i dont know whats going to become of it but i know the 
people are not going to take it lying down store owner donna 
myers said tuesday theyre going to fight for it 
the systems partyline users of crankoperated telephones 
running on batteries and magnetos are linked to the world beyond by 
a single wire connected to insulators hanging from rocks poles and 
trees such systems were common in rural america decades ago but 
only a few still operate 
they can ring each other but calls to and from the outside must 
go through a local operator on incoming calls the operator alerts 
the proper customer with a coded ring mrs myers is three longs 
but earlier this month the north fork customers were notified 
that the operator will no longer be so handy 
the operator service based in salmon 20 miles to the southeast 
by air is handled by the local exchange company century telephone 
co under contract to atampt on dec 15 atampt is consolidating 
operator services for the area to salt lake city 
computerized switching equipment that will handle longdistance 
calls for century telephone customers cant handle a ring down 
system like the north forks placing calls through the salt lake 
operator would run up longdistance charges 
century manager frank barsalou said theres no reason to keep on 
an operator because all theyd do is handle the canyon calls 
north fork customers could hire their own operator but it would 
cost more than 1600 a week for roundtheclock service 
a study is being made to see if service hours could be curtailed 
and a switcher someone less skilled than an operator hired to 
route calls in and out of the canyon 
canyon residents are accustomed to living without electricity and 
only seasonal running water but marsha smith said the phone 
announcement hit us so unexpectedly weve always been assured we 
would have this service 
a letterwriting campaign to public and telephone industry 
officials has been started in hopes of bringing attention to the 
problem 
this old phone it might have its ups and downs but by golly 
its been a lifesaver in a lot of cases said mrs myers we 
have things from people who were hurt and needed ambulances to cars 
breaking down 
the system originally used by the us forest service was 
bought by the resident cooperative in 1952 when the government 
switched to radio communications 
because the salmon is a wilderness river in that area west of 
north fork the forest service will not allow installation of new 
aboveground telephone lines and burying the phone cable has been 
estimated to cost 600000 
but barsalou said theyre really not interested in a modern 
system they want to keep their old crank phones 
we would much rather have this for a wilderness area said 
north fork vice president john booker 
idaho public utilities commissioner perry swisher believes 
service can be saved if everyone cooperates until a technological 
answer is found 
whats bothered me personally is that i havent seen much 
imagination by the telecommunication people in how to get down that 
canyon with service swisher said 
mrs myers thinks a solution will take some time but one way 
or another theyre going to work it out they all know we need that 
phone system

the united mine workers and the pittston co 
agreed today to resume contract talks under supervision of a 
mediator in an effort to end a bitter strike that has idled 
thousands of coal miners in several states 
umw president richard trumka and pittston vice president joseph 
farrell signed an agreement to hold negotiations wednesday morning 
for the first time since june 8 
under the agreement a federal mediator will meet with each side 
separately and deliver proposals to the other party 
the agreement also said pittston can continue to claim that talks 
are at an impasse and the union can still claim that pittston has 
failed to bargain in good faith 
the agreement was a result of a fourhour meeting with us 
district judge glenn williams 
in the coal fields more than 4000 umw miners failed to report 
for work at alabamas two largest coal companies today a day after 
they ended a fourweek walkout but a union official told them to go 
back for tonights shift 
trumka was joined at the meeting by umw vice president cecil 
roberts district 28 president jackie stump and judith scott and 
michael buckner from the unions headquarters in washington 
joining odom at the table was joseph farrell vice president for 
the pittston co the coal groups parent company 
the walkout at pittston one of the few coal companies not to 
sign a umw contract last year led to unauthorized sympathy walkouts 
beginning last month that affected up to 46000 miners in 10 states 
most of those miners have since gone back to work but wildcat 
strikes still affect several thousand miners in west virginia and 
two mining companies in alabama reported that about 4000 miners 
failed to show up this morning a union official told them to go 
back for tonights shift 
negotiations between the two sides broke down june 8 the 
governors of virginia and west virginia had issued similar offers to 
mediate talks but pittston officials had declined them 
about 1900 umw members are striking pittston in a dispute over 
benefits and job security issues the strike began april 5 in 
virginia and west virginia before spreading to kentucky hundreds of 
miners have been arrested for a variety of violent incidents as well 
as civil disobedience tactics 
federal statistics released friday gave an indication of how 
wildcat strikes that began june 12 are affecting coal production 
the data showed that during the third week of the walkout coal 
production had dropped by 57 percent in the eastern half of the 
country and 42 percent nationally compared with prestrike levels 
some miners in southern west virginia remained on wildcat strikes 
today awaiting the outcome of todays meeting trumka last friday 
asked the wildcat strikers to return to work and most appeared to 
be doing so on monday 
it was time to come back said ron airhart president of umw 
local 1412 at keystone coal mining corp in indiana county pa 
we made an important statement we got the countrys attention 
now well get to work again and hope weve made a difference 
they have a full complement of people out there today and 
everything seems to have started up very well said carl heldt 
director of human resources for old ben coal co in oakland city 
ind 
theyre in good spirits ive been told by the mine management 
that people seemed delighted and eager to be there theyve been 
without paychecks for about a month 
in west virginia pickets continued to idle mines 
there were pickets out there today scattered all over the 
highway said fred jarrell president of local 1330 at 
consolidation coal cos rowland mine in raleigh county about 60 
miles southeast of charleston 
i stood up there yesterday and preached for two hours telling 
people to go back to work i dont think it did any good 
some scattered violence was reported monday in southern west 
virginia with coal trucks serving nonunion elk run coal co in 
boone county hit by rocks and other projectiles 
mark polen vice president of the west virginia coal association 
blamed a radical minority within the union for keeping the mines 
idle primarily in charlestonbased district 17 whose 8000 working 
members are among the most militant in the nation 
district 17 is the root as usual of the problems polen 
said 
some 200 island creek coal co workers also were off the job in 
western kentucky on monday evening company spokeswoman julie accola 
said she did not immediately return a telephone call this morning 
on whether they returned today 
in alabama 4000 miners failed to report for work at the states 
two largest coal companies jim walter resources and the drummond 
co just one day after they ended a fourweek wildcat walkout 
company officials said today union officials declined to comment on 
reports that the walkout stemmed from the firing of several miners

former presidential aide michael k deaver 
citing a 1 million legal bill is seeking to reduce to 25000 the 
100000 fine he was ordered to pay for lying under oath about his 
lobbying business 
but the independent counsel who had sought a prison term for 
deaver suggested the former white house aide could pay the fine by 
selling his familys home at a large profit 
independent counsel whitney north seymour said that the value of 
deavers house has risen from its 1985 purchase price of 990000 to 
145 million 
any reduction in the fine should be viewed against the 
background of the leniency the court has already exercised toward 
this defendant seymour said in response to the request deaver 
made last month 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson who imposed the 
100000 fine and ordered deaver to perform 1500 hours of community 
service has not ruled on the defense request 
in their june 16 filing defense lawyers said deaver had not made 
any payments on the fine because his expenses which include an 
8250 monthly mortgage payment continue to exceed his income 
until he recently took a public relations job which pays 6500 
a month deaver was without virtually any means of support for his 
family other than borrowing money against his home to pay for 
monthly living expenses the defense said 
deaver who was deputy white house chief of staff for president 
reagan until 1985 also has legal bills of more than 1 million 
resulting from the investigation and prosecution that ruined his 
lobbying business the defense said 
as a condition of probation jackson barred deaver for lobbying 
the government for profit for three years 
deaver a close friend of the former president and his wife 
nancy was convicted of three felony counts of lying to a house 
subcommittee and a federal grand jury that investigated his lobbying 
business for possible ethicslaw violations 
seymour who disclosed that federal probation officers suggested 
that deaver be sentenced up to 10 months in prison said the former 
lobbyist was in a better position to pay the fine than he was at 
the time it was imposed 
among other things deaver is now earning a healthy salary 
which was not true when this court imposed the sentence in question 
here seymour said in his june 22 court filing 
but the prosecutor said the appreciation of the value of deavers 
house by 460000 was the most significant disclosure in the 
financial statement submitted to the judge 
deavers share of the equity in his home more than doubled 
since his sentencing in an ammount more than sufficient to pay off 
the fine in full seymour said 
the defense said in a reply to seymours filing that it is 
extremely doubtful that mr deavers home would bring anything near 
its appraised value in todays real estate market especially if he 
was forced to sell 
defense lawyers said deavers fine should be reduced to an 
amount that while substantial can be paid without requiring him to 
sell his home or go substantially further into debt 
besides his outstanding legal fees deaver must pay the balance 
of his 871464 mortgage in three years the defense said his 
monthly expenses are more than 12000 
the financial statement attached to deavers court filing did not 
detail the earnings of his wife carolyn who works as a real estate 
agent 
deaver who abandoned efforts to appeal his case earlier this 
year has begun counseling alcoholics at a downtown shelter for the 
homeless 
under the terms of jacksons order deaver a recovering 
alcoholic will be required to spend nights and weekends at the 
shelter deavers work involves interviewing prospective patients 
for the 25bed clinic leading alcoholics anonymous meetings and 
counseling individuals 
he is also helping a georgetown university medical professor 
devise a course to teach medical students to spot the symptoms of 
alcoholism 
deaver declined through his attorney randall j turk to discuss 
his community service saying publicity would jeopardize his 
attempts to win the trust of the street alcoholics he is counseling

a federal judge says she will order a computer 
hacker to spend a year in a rehabilitation center to treat what was 
called his addiction to computer tampering 
kevin mitnick who authorities had described as too dangerous to 
be allowed near a telephone alone for fear he might access 
computers will be placed in the custody of gateways hospitals 
rehabilitation program us district judge mariana pfaelzer said 
monday 
the judge said she will decide today whether mitnick should also 
be sentenced to prison he was scheduled to be sentenced this 
afternoon 
mitnick 25 pleaded guilty in march to computer fraud and 
possessing unauthorized longdistance telephone codes 
he previously was convicted of using unauthorized mci long 
distance codes to tap into computers at leeds university in england 
and the university of southern california and of causing million of 
dollars in damage to a digital equipment corp computer system 
both harriet rossetto the rehabilitation programs director and 
assistant us attorney james r asperger said mitnicks case was 
the first they had heard of in which a person charged with computer 
hacking had been treated as an addict 
ms rossetto testified that mitnick has an impulse disorder 
and would benefit from treatment she said his illegal computer 
activity gives him a sense of selfesteem he is otherwise lacking 
this is a new and growing addiction she said there was no 
greed involved there was no sabotage involved 
its something like climbing mt everest asperger said he 
did it because its there

house republican whip newt gingrich is seeking 
help from a former house colleague in mounting a legal defense to 
the expected ethics committee investigation of his conduct gop 
sources said tuesday 
the georgia congressman has approached former rep ed bethune an 
arkansas republican with a law practice in washington the sources 
said speaking only on condition of anonymity bethune would not say 
whether or not he had spoken with gingrich 
gingrich the secondranking house republican answered yes 
when asked if he expected an investigation to cost him a lot of 
money but he declined further comment until the ethics committee 
meets thursday to decide whether to begin a preliminary 
investigation 
gingrich whose complaint helped lead to the committee 
investigation that drove former speaker jim wright from the house 
was himself accused last april of possibly violating house rules on 
gifts and outside income as well as campaignfinance laws 
the complaint by rep bill alexander dark focused on an 
investment partnership formed by gingrich and run by his wife to 
promote a book they wrote along with a third writer 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois said when asked 
about gingrichs plans on tuesday i heard hes thinking of 
contacting former members it gets to be a pretty expensive thing 
if the ethics panel officially the committee on standards of 
official conduct begins a probe it could hire an outside counsel 
as it did in the case of wright who resigned as speaker and as a 
member last june after the panel charged him with 69 rules 
violations 
the chicago lawyer who conducted the wright investigation didnt 
dispute that he has discussed with the panel playing a similar role 
in the gingrich probe 
i hear those rumors richard j phelan said i wouldnt 
deny the rumors 
he added theres been a lot of discussion in congress about 
whether i would do it or not we will have to leave that up to the 
chairman julian dixon dcalif or ranking member john t myers 
rind 
ethics committee member vic fazio dcalif asked about the 
hiring of an outside counsel said theres obviously a lot of 
inclination to go that route there are people who think any time 
you are dealing with a leadership position outside counsel is 
appropriate on a personal level i think an outside counsel is 
appropriate if its determined theres a reason to investigate 
rep alexanders complaint said gingrich may have violated house 
rules when 21 investors contributed 5000 each to the cos limited 
partnership which was formed by gingrich in 1984 to promote his 
book window of opportunity 
the complaint contends 
the investors money could be construed as income to gingrich 
in violation of limitations on house members outside earnings 
the 105000 raised could constitute a gift to gingrich from 
those with a direct interest in legislation house rules prohibit 
members from keeping gifts of more than 100 from anyone with such 
an interest 
the money could be considered campaign contributions subject to 
reporting obligations and restrictions under campaign financing 
laws if so alexander said the investment money may have exceeded 
contribution limits and may not have been properly reported 
gingrich said in april that none of the investors received 
unusual or extraordinary personal help from him in their 
dealings with the federal government but the lawmaker acknowledged 
that some of the investors had a direct interest in legislation and 
that he had handled routine requests from some of them 
the cos limited partnership was unusual because promotion of a 
book is usually financed by the publisher gingrich has said he 
believed the partnership could use a large publicity budget to give 
him a best seller 
instead sales of the book were modest and there were no profits 
for investors who got tax writeoffs instead 
gingrichs wife marianne received a 10000 payment for setting 
up the organization and later was given a 2 percent interest in the 
partnership and a 1500 payment for her work as general manager of 
cos limited according to records released by the couple

collection notices are being prepared for a new 
batch of farmers home administration borrowers who missed paying 
loan installments the first of the year the agency said tuesday 
as of july 3 there were 15704 newly delinquent borrowers 
notices telling them to settle their debts or face foreclosure will 
be mailed by early fall upon receipt a delinquent borrower will 
have 45 days to respond 
maryln aycock an fmha spokesman said the new wave of 
delinquencies is in addition to more than 66000 borrowers notified 
last fall that they would have to provide certain financial and 
production information to the agency if they wanted help in handling 
their debts 
if there is no response or if a borrower is in such poor 
financial shape that no alternative can be worked out forced sale 
or foreclosure proceedings are in order the fmha said 
the procedure is specified by the agricultural credit act of 
1987 which requires fmha collectors to tell delinquent borrowers of 
various liberalized debtservicing options available to the 
borrowers 
aycock said the 15704 newest delinquencies represent a sharp 
reduction from more than 30000 who missed the jan 1 deadline but 
made their payments later 
it will continue to go down as we get into the year aycock 
said in an interview by the time we get around to mailing the 
notices i dont know what itll be 
the fmha an agency of the agriculture department is often 
called the governments farm lender of last resort eligible 
borrowers cannot qualify for loans from commercial lenders 
when the first notices were mailed last fall farmers had 45 days 
in which to apply for loan assistance which could include 
reamortization or rescheduling payment deferral reduced interest 
rates and in some cases debt forgiveness 
the fmha in turn had 60 days in which to review the 
applications and decide on debtrelief options for the farmers 
delinquent borrowers submitted more than 35000 applications but 
more than 31000 who were notified last fall did not respond 
according to april 24 figures the agencys most recent more than 
12500 farmers had qualified for some kind of debt adjustment 
the remainder of those applications received were still awaiting 
fmha action as of april 24 or had been returned incomplete some 
had been settled by borrowers or were written off by the agency 
in all about 919 million of the estimated 88 billion in 
delinquent loans were written off entirely or reduced under the 
laws writedown provisions by april 24 speculation has circulated 
for months that fmha eventually may write off or write down 2 
billion or more 
by state as of july 3 here are the number of new delinquent 
farmers who will be getting notices from the fmha the first column 
includes the total number of farm borrowers and the second is the 
number of delinquents farmers whose payments are at least six 
months past due

nazi hunters who helped track down 
suspected german war criminal josef schwammberger said argentine 
officials are taking too long to extradite him to west germany 
schwammberger 77 was one of the worlds mostwanted suspected 
war criminals before his arrest in argentina in november 1987 on a 
west german warrant 
prosecutors say he was responsible for the torture and murder of 
thousands of people mostly jews while commander of nazi labor 
camps during world war ii 
highranking officials from the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles said they were worried that schwammberger remains in 
argentina 
the hard truth is they have had ample time to deal with the 
matter and now were getting worried said rabbi marvin hier 
dean at the simon wiesenthal center on monday 
its happened before that people have died in jail without 
being brought to justice hier said in an interview at the cologne 
hotel where he was staying 
hier said he was informed by west german justice minister hans 
engelhard on monday that argentina has told west germany the 
extradition hearings could take another year 
this is an ominous development hier said we think its 
necessary for the new argentine government to immediately declare 
itself on the schwammberger case 
president carlos menem of argentina succeeded raul alfonsin this 
month 
hier also met in bonn with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
hier said he asked the chancellor to contact menem about 
schwammberger 
the chancellor responded that he would look into this matter 
and indicated there would be contact hier said 
simon wiesenthal the famous austrian nazi hunter and colleagues 
working for him had sought schwammberger for years 
in october 1987 the simon wiesenthal center listed schwammberger 
as among the mostwanted nazi war criminals still at large and 
announced he was believed hiding in argentina 
the centers list appeared in argentine newspapers and argentine 
authorities were tipped off about his whereabouts 
according to rabbi abraham cooper associate dean at the los 
angeles center the wiesenthal organization has found about 50 
witnesses in the united states canada israel and britain who can 
testify that schwammberger was responsible for the murder of labor 
camp inmates 
cooper said they included about a dozen former labor camp inmates 
who saw schwammberger personally carrying out inmate executions 
to us the most important thing is putting schwammberger on 
trial for history hier said to allow a person like this to sit 
in jail in argentina without a trial doesnt serve the record of 
history

some say seattlites drink more espresso than 
water in a city as wet as seattle thats saying a lot for 10 
years or so the thick rich brew has been found in department 
stores theater lobbies ice cream shops even at newsstands 
seattle has espresso bars lining downtown streets street vendors 
hawk an aromatic cup the way hot dogs and pretzels are sold in 
manhattan 
when it comes to coffee seattle is in a class by itself 
people there dont realize how well off they are until they 
travel said jerry baldwin owner of peets coffee in berkeley 
calif and cofounder of starbucks coffee in seattle 
seattle is spoken of in reverent terms in the specialty coffee 
industry now said baldwin 
dan sampson owner of a dankens ice cream parlor near the 
university of washington has watched as espresso shops just keep 
opening up its unbelievable 
sampson joined the craze his store serves nearly a dozen kinds 
of espresso drinks and specialty coffees 
we put the machine in here because theres not any place in 
town that people dont come in and ask for espresso sampson said 
i would have been scared to open a place in seattle without an 
espresso machine 
at the varsity theater the menu includes milk duds popcorn and 
espresso 
you should see it in the wintertime its a madhouse in here 
all the espresso we make carol texeira said from the ticket booth 
visitors sometimes dont know what to make of the drink said 
james egan who serves espresso from a cart on the space needles 
observation deck 
the people from montana and wyoming want to know what its 
about and i try to explain it to them but then they usually dont 
want to have anything to do with it they say give me a cup of 
coffee 
originally a middle eastern drink espresso was transported to 
italy and from there all over the world todays version is brewed 
in a special machine where 200degree water is pressured through 
darkroasted coffee beans that have been ground to a dustlike 
consistency 
the result is a concentrated syrupy brew that can cost from 70 
cents to 2 or more for an exotic drink 
its the best coffee in the world said kristen barry 
sipping a tall espresso drink at espresso roma cafe i only hope 
the rest of the united states catches on to espresso because you 
cant get it outside seattle 
barry said her favorite drink is an espresso variant called iced 
chocolate almond latte seattle shops feature several varieties on 
the latte theme which in its most basic form is a shot of espresso 
in a glass of steamed milk the more familiar cappuccino is espresso 
in foamed milk 
from there the combinations are limited only by the servers 
supplies and the drinkers imagination add nutmeg mocha lemon 
cinammon raspberry almond and on and on 
to purists such flavoring is fluff 
the good places are the ones that will automatically put two 
shots in ask for a double and you get three said angie autio 
who drinks espresso along seattles capitol hill 
shoppers often browse with a cup in their hands and espresso 
carts are rarely more than a block away from any downtown office 
theories abound on why seattle has become so coffeeconscious 
baldwin said people in seattle were receptive to new coffee tastes 
theyre not smug nobody ever thought seattle was the beall 
and endall of everything he said people in san francisco and 
new york have a tendency to think that they already have 
everything 
autio has her own theory 
this place is very laidback theres not a lot to wake you 
up she said maybe if i were in new york i wouldnt need it 
but here i do

a group calling itself the bloodbright dare to 
die squad says it will kill two japanese each month because they 
collude with the dictatorial government of china the 
japanese embassy said tuesday 
a letter in chinese mailed to the japan airlines office in 
beijing also said citizens of other countries would be killed if 
they collaborated with the regime 
police continued rounding up participants in prodemocracy 
protests that ended with the army crackdown june 34 reports 
tuesday said journalist dai qing and yang wei a recently freed 
dissident linked to a chinese group in new york had been arrested 
ms dai a reporter for the guangming daily was a leader in a 
democracy movement among intellectuals last fall after students 
took to the streets in april demanding reforms she signed several 
petitions to the government 
her husband reached by telephone said plainclothes police 
arrived at their home during dinner thursday and led her away he 
said he had not heard from her since 
it was the first known arrest of a journalist involved in the 
protests hundreds of journalists marched and signed petitions for 
press freedom and are said to be required now to write 
selfcriticisms 
xinhua the official news agency said shanghai police arrested 
yang on tuesday for allegedly conducting demagogical propaganda 
for counterrevolutionary ends yang 33 was jailed from 1987 
until january on similar charges 
while studying in the united states in 1985 he wrote articles 
for a journal published by the china alliance for democracy an 
expatriate group seeking political reform 
more than 2060 arrests were reported in china in the first weeks 
after the june 34 crackdown official reports of arrests have been 
rare recently but unofficial ones from families and friends 
continue 
chinese sources say arrests have exceeded 2000 in beijing alone 
a local official of japan airlines said the company had not 
decided whether to take special security precautions because of the 
letter received monday 
it said because the japanese pirates collude with the 
communist party dictatorial government and plot to launch a 
largescale economic invasion of china from today we the 
bloodbright dare to die squad enter into a state of war with the 
japanese pirates it said 
two japanese businessmen tourists or people considered friends 
of chinas ruling party will be killed each month beginning aug 15 
the letter said it made no specific demands but said the killings 
would increase next year to one a week if japan did not repent 
please tell other countries if they collude with the 
dictatorial government they will meet the same fate the letter 
concluded 
we dont know how serious this is said hideo watanabe first 
secretary of the japanese embassy 
the letters tone and terminology suggested links to the student 
movement students and supporters in many cities formed dare to 
die squads during the prodemocracy campaign and there has been 
speculation some would go underground 
when dynamite exploded on a shanghaibound train june 26 killing 
24 people authorities said they suspected sabotage results of a 
police investigation have not been released but the government 
later issued emergency orders for tighter security to stop the 
enemy from blowing up and sabotaging railway facilities 
china has no known terrorist organizations acts of sabotage are 
reported from time to time but usually are attributed to 
disgruntled individuals 
official controls and supervision extend to many aspects of daily 
life making it difficult for an underground organization to operate 
watanabe said about 1000 japanese are in beijing roughly half 
the number living in the capital before political turmoil caused 
many foreigners to leave 
some japanese businessmen have returned but express reservations 
about future investment their government has halted highlevel 
contacts with china and frozen development aid 
in the only other known case of a terrorist threat to foreigners 
authorities told the us embassy in june 1988 that nationals of a 
third country planned to attack americans in beijing 
china said several days later the danger had passed but gave no 
public explanation the third country was not identified

amnesty international is asking india to account 
for three sikh activists and four suspected criminals who are feared 
by the human rights group to have been killed in police custody 
the londonbased group said witnesses reported the seven men were 
taken away during police raids in april 1987 and january 1988 
it said authorities at first acknowledged some of the detentions 
but later denied them 
in a report released wednesday amnesty international called for 
speedy impartial and independent investigations into these and 
other disappearances it also said police and security forces 
implicated in such cases should be prosecuted 
indian courts have in rare cases held police or army officials 
responsible for disappearances and ordered states to pay 
compensation to relatives however no officials are known to have 
been prosecuted or convicted in such cases the report said 
the three sikhs who were suspected of political violence in the 
northern state of punjab disappeared in midjanuary 1988 after 
reportedly being arrested by plainclothes officers in chandigarh and 
mohali the report said 
the government has tried to put down a movement of sikh militants 
who want a separate homeland in june 1984 authorities raided the 
sikh golden temple at amritsar leaving 1200 people dead 
the report identified the three detained sikhs as mechanic manjit 
singh electrician jatinder pal singh and taxi driver balwinder 
singh 
it said fellow detainees whose identities were not published 
claimed they saw the first two at mayi ki sarai interrogation center 
at the end of january 1988 and said the men had been severely 
tortured the report said 
another former detainee at the interrogation center said he saw 
the third man taxi driver balwinder singh and said he also had 
been tortured no date was given for when he was reportedly seen 
amnesty international which has been barred by prime minister 
rajiv gandhi from visiting punjab says most cases of disappearances 
in the state are difficult to verify but it said the three cases in 
the report were welldocumented sometimes by eyewitnesses 
the human rights group said the other missing men include truck 
driver puran singh described by police as a robber and his 
18yearold assistant shyam singh 
they were last seen by relatives at an apartment in nai abadi in 
the hapur district of uttar pradesh on april 10 1987 the report 
said 
witnesses said the men were taken away by police officers of the 
lajpat nagar station in new delhi apparently on suspicion of 
robbery according to the report police said they went to the 
suspects house but made no arrests 
two farmers veer singh and his cousin tilak ram were reported 
to disappear that same day in an apparently related police raid in 
baraundi 30 miles away the report said 
there is strong evidence that the four have been killed 
either by shooting or following torture while in police custody and 
that staff of the south delhi police have tried to cover up the 
murder the report said

tom fenton publisher of the el paso texas 
times was an associated press correspondent in nicaragua during the 
final days of the somoza regime he recalls the time in this account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
managua was a place of fear and confusion in the last days of 
anastasio somozas regime it was a smoky noisy intensely 
dangerous city with few safe havens 
smoldering tires and pavingstone barricades turned streets into 
obstacle courses where ambushers might lurk looters smashed shop 
windows renegade soldiers and guerrillas relieved the unarmed and 
unwary of watches wallets and jewelry 
bombs demolished restaurants teenage snipers some shorter than 
their rifles played hitandrun with somozas army 
white flags flew from automobile antennas drivers hoped that 
would make them less of a target but it seldom worked 
somozas air force attacked guerrilla concentrations inside the 
city strafing rocketing even rolling bombs out of helicopters 
at las mercedes airport east of the city somoza supporters and 
their families tried desperately to get on departing flights somoza 
stayed in his bunker 
reporting became especially difficult and dangerous in may 1979 
sandinistas infiltrated the city you never knew when you would run 
into soldiers or guerrillas or how they would react 
journalists like combat troops learned to gauge situations by 
watching people in the street normal movement meant it was safe to 
proceed scurrying usually meant danger if no one was about the 
area probably was in someones field of fire 
we learned to watch for flaring nostrils on soldiers or 
guerrillas a sign of extreme agitation that meant it was time to 
leave if you could 
a chance encounter with irritable soldiers in managua cost abctv 
correspondent bill stewart his life stewart and his interpreter in 
the country only a few days were shot to death at an army 
checkpoint 
his crew recorded his death in dramatic television footage 
stewart was forced to his knees then made to lie face down in the 
street a corporal put the muzzle of his m16 to the back of the 
correspondents head and blew it away 
soldiers realized their mistake when they opened stewarts rented 
van and saw the american film crew a quickwitted nicaraguan driver 
saved their lives by suggesting to the soldiers that the murder be 
blamed on sandinistas 
the body was put into the van and stewarts crew returned to the 
intecontinental hotel just 200 yards from somozas bunker 
in case the army came to seize the tapes the abc crew made 
duplicates and passed them out to journalists in hopes at least one 
would be smuggled out of the country 
it was unnecessary abc transmited the tape to new york from 
sozomas satellite ground station before nicaraguan officials 
realized what it contained 
stewarts death was shown across the world and hastened the end 
of the somoza regime it also caused an evacuation of american 
journalists 
a us air force c130 arrived and took about 25 journalists 
most of them network television people and some american dependents 
to panama those who remained had the curious uncomfortable task of 
reporting the evacuation of our colleagues

israeli officials are increasing pressure on the 
bush administration to halt its dialogue with yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organization 
as part of the campaign foreign minister moshe arens on tuesday 
instructed more than 100 israeli embassies and missions abroad to 
distribute a report alleging the plo had not abandoned terror 
it was arafats pledge in december that cleared the way for the 
dialogue with the united states and israeli officials hope they can 
force an end to the dialogue by showing the plo broke its word 
the report compiled by israeli security officials said arafats 
fatah faction had launched 70 antiisraeli attacks this year 10 of 
which were carried out within israels pre1967 borders 
in an earlier report the foreign ministry listed nine attempts 
by plo groups to cross israels northern border from lebanon between 
december and june 
foreign ministry spokesman danny naveh also noted a dramatic 
increase in attacks on palestinians by other palestinians saying 
it coincided with prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace initiative 
approved by the cabinet on may 14 
the proposal calls for palestinian representatives to be elected 
to negotiate interim autonomy for the occupied territories the 
final status of the areas would be determined in later talks 
right after the prime ministers initiative was launched there 
was a dramatic increase in the murder of arabs by arabs said 
naveh we believe it is the result of plo terrorism in judea 
samaria west bank and the gaza strip 
as evidence he noted the report said the number of palestinians 
killed by other arabs rose from an average 16 per month in 1988 to 
14 per month in june 1989 
arens told parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee on 
monday that he had met recently with more than 10 palestinians from 
the west bank and gaza and all said they would not participate in 
the elections plan for fear of reprisal from the plo 
palestinian personalities with whom i met told me that anybody 
who presents his candidacy for elections without plo suport may find 
himself dead in 24 hours arens told the committee 
in a speech to us fundraisers later in the day arens attacked 
western leaders for meeting plo officials 
leaders of the western world who meet with terror heads create 
the perception with palestinians on the ground here that they have 
no choice but to surrender to the pressure and fear of plo terror 
said arens 
in support of the claim the report said palestinians carried out 
1403 assaults this year 710 against jews and the rest against 
other arabs 
since the start of the uprising in december 1987 it said a total 
of 64 palestinians have been killed and 243 wounded by other 
palestinians 
by associated press count 512 palestinians have been killed by 
israelis most of them shot to death by soldiers the ap lists 82 
palestinians killed by other palestinians since dec 8 1987 
most of the victims have been described by arab reporters and 
residents as either collaborators with israeli authorities or drug 
dealers and prostitutes few of those attacked have been political 
dissidents according to palestinian sources 
with increasing pointedness israeli officials have urged us 
diplomats and visiting us jewish leaders to persuade the bush 
administration to abandon its dialogue with the plo which they 
claim is undermining the election plan 
the us must decide whether to support the peace initiative 
and its dialogue with the plo the two are mutually incompatible 
yossi ben aharon the directorgeneral of the prime ministry said 
earlier this week 
the only chance for a dialogue can be through a dialogue with 
the arabs here and the plo is an obstacle to that understanding 
there is no way to bridge that gap because we will never deliver the 
palestinian population to the plo 
the israeli campaign is likely to gain force following tuesdays 
death of rita levine 39 of philadelphia she died of injuries 
suffered in the july 6 palestinian attack on an israeli bus that 
left 14 other people dead and 26 injured 
israeli officials hope their campaign will persuade a majority in 
the us congress to order a halt to the dialogue in response sen 
jesse helms rnc has introduced legislation that would bar 
usplo talks unless president bush certified participants had no 
connection to acts of terror 
but the campaign by rightwingers is undercut by liberals in the 
coalition government who advocate direct dealings with the plo and 
argue that israel is already conducting an indirect political 
dialogue with the plo 
for months clear official unequivocal negotiations have been 
underway between the israeli government headed by yitzhak shamir vi 
the americans said deputy finance minister yossi beilin of the 
labor party

rapidly rising prescription drug prices may 
soon affect health care for the elderly members of the senate 
special committee on aging said tuesday 
steadily rising prescription prices have been driving up the 
costs of medicaid programs across the country and are a concern as 
well for the medicare program some lawmakers are concerned that the 
medicare drug benefit which takes effect in 1991 may already be 
underfunded 
from 1981 through 1988 the prescription drug inflation rate of 
88 percent dwarfed the general inflation rate of 28 percent said 
sen david pryor the committee chairman 
sen richard shelby dala said that soon many elderly will 
be priced out of the market 
sen herbert kohl dwis worried that senior citizens are 
already getting squeezed out and are not having their 
prescriptions filled or are cutting their doses to make their drugs 
last longer 
manufacturers claim they need exhorbitant prices in order to 
pay for their research and development expenses pryor said the 
truth is though that the american public is footing much of the 
bill for drug companies research expenses 
pryor also released a report by the panels democratic staff 
members showing that most of the new drugs pharmaceutical companies 
put on the market are duplicates of drugs already being sold 
that report found that 84 percent of the 348 new drugs brought to 
market by the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies between 1981 and 
1988 were judged by the food and drug administration as providing 
little or no therapeutic potential to improve on existing drugs 
the committee staff also said that hospitals and the department 
of veterans affairs get the best prices for prescription drugs 
sometimes paying several times less than prices charged by 
pharmacies where medicaid and medicare patients get most of their 
medications 
winston barton secretary of the kansas department of social and 
rehabilitation services said his state has kept medicaid 
prescription costs down with a bidding procedure under the program 
drug manufacturers bid for a contract that ensures the company 
volume sales and the state discounted prices 
but barton said the program has met with significant resistance 
from the pharmaceutical industry because the discounts cut into 
profits 
the pharmaceutical companies are the only entity in the health 
care field that do not pay their fair share in meeting the 
healthcare needs of the poor of this country barton testified 
the department of veterans affairs also negotiates for discounted 
prices for drugs it distributes but dennis m styrsky chief of the 
departments pharmaceutical products division said success is 
unfortunately very limited because some drug companies wont 
participate 
most of the drug companies asked to testify refused pryor said 
gerald mossinghoff president of the pharmaceutical manufacturers 
association defended the industry saying its share of the 
healthcare dollar dropped from more than 12 percent in 1965 to just 
under 7 percent in 1987 
drug prices he said reflect extensive research and development 
commitments which have doubled every five years since 1970 
mossinghoff said costs for labor materials product promotion and 
taxes have also grown 
also he said companies have had to shorten the time during 
which they recover their research expenses because of the surge in 
genericdrug competition that comes when a brandname drug patent 
expires

the iranian ambassador to france returned tuesday 
the embassy said five months after being recalled home during the 
furor over the book the satanic verses 
irans decision to send back ambassador ali ahani was prompted by 
french ambassador christian graffs return to tehran last month 
said irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in

the bush administration lowered its forecast 
for the economy on tuesday and warned congress to abide by its 
budget blueprint or risk busting the 110 billion legal limit for 
the fiscal 1990 federal deficit 
but an uproar developed on capitol hill over an administration 
plan to save 29 billion in fiscal 1990 opening oct 1 simply by 
shifting a military payday from oct 1 to sept 29 the nexttolast 
day of fiscal 1989 
congressional budgetwriters complained that the pentagons shift 
was encouraging house and senate committees to claim deficit 
reduction by bumping paydays of other agencies f 
percent in 1990 
the administration remains confident of the future course of 
the us economy said michael boskin chairman of the presidents 
council of economic advisers 
each figure was more pessimistic than the administration had 
forecast in february estimates that at the time were called overly 
rosy by congressional and many outside economists 
darman told the budget committee that the new projections were 
still a little on the optimistic side but achievable 
a slowing economy generally boosts the federal deficit because 
goverment revenues drop and its expenses increase from higher 
interest payments and benefits paid to unemployed and poor people 
but the administration forecast that if congress enacts all the 
savings included in the budget lawmakers passed in may the deficit 
would be 992 billion thats even lower than the 994 billion 
deficit forecast earlier this year 
the gloomier economic assumptions were more than compensated for 
by a 15 billion increase in 1990 tax collections over what was 
expected in february and 43 billion less in defense spending than 
februarys estimate largely due to the payday shift 
but the administration officials warned that congress had little 
room to avoid surpassing the 110 billion shortfall ceiling if the 
target is breached the grammrudman deficitreduction law would 
trigger spending slashes in domestic and defense programs 
there is very little room for slippage darman said 
congressional committees are still working on the spending tax 
and savings bills needed to actually implement the 117 trillion 
budget for 1990 
the administration also revised downward its projection for the 
1989 deficit to 1483 billion from 1641 billion predicted in 
february mainly due to revenues running 132 billion higher than 
anticipated 
and the officials said that enactment of the savings in the 1990 
budget would leave lawmakers facing an 88 billion deficit for 
fiscal 1991 within 24 billion of the 64 billion grammrudman 
target for that year 
a storm brewed however over the pentagons paydate shift 
defense secretary dick cheney ordered the pay shift in may 
arguing that oct 1 will fall on a sunday he said moving the payday 
for the monthly checks to the previous friday would avoid 
inconveniencing troops 
under a 1965 law that darman said has been invoked seven times 
the defense secretary has the authority to move the payday 
but lawmakers grumbled that the payday shift enabled cheney to 
claim a solution to a dispute between the administration and 
congress over the pentagons budget in which congressional budget 
officials were claiming that the military would spend too much money 
next year 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn told 
reporters that the administration cant foster the use of gimmicks 
on the department of defense side of the ledger and not expect 
similar treatment from congress on the domestic side of the ledger 
the house appropriations committee on monday approved a spending 
bill in which 316 million in 1990 savings were claimed by shifting 
a payday for nasa the environmental protection agency and the 
department of veterans affairs from october to september 
congressional budget officials estimate that if lawmakers shift 
the paydays for all agencies 55 billion would be claimed in 
savings another 48 billion would be claimed as savings if federal 
pension payments were bumped into september 
congressional leaders worked monday and tuesday to try to stem 
the tide of committees shifting the paydays 
at the budget panel hearing darman would not back down from the 
pentagon shift but promised to oppose payday slippages by other 
agencies 
our firm policy is no new pay shifts he said a play on 
president bushs no new taxes campaign pledge

coal miners feel the government is making empty 
promises and will contine an 8dayold strike that has hampered 
operations at scores of soviet factories a spokesman for siberian 
miners said tuesday 
the soviet unions worst labor trouble since the turmoil of the 
1920s spread like a chain reaction to two more mines in the 
donetsk coal basin in the ukraine a strike leader said the 
official news agency tass said 39 mines in region were closed 
no new figures were available on the total number of strikers in 
donetsk and western siberias kuznetsk basin the nations main 
coalproducing regions but earlier reports put the figure at more 
than 112000 
tass said the strike had affected more than 160 coal machinery 
electronics and light industrial businesses in western siberia alone 
and that lack of coal could cause a catastrophe at steel and 
power plants 
government officials appealed on radio for kuznetsk miners to 
return to their jobs but tass acknowledged the effort might be 
futile 
many of them are obviously irritated and have stopped 
believing in the endless promises of local officials and central 
agencies about improvements in work and living conditions the 
agency said 
the kremlin sent nikolai n slyunkov a politburo member with 
experience in industry and labor to kuznetsk to negotiate with the 
miners 
valery legachev a spokesman for the regional strike committee in 
kuznetsk said miners were continuing their walkout because slyunkov 
made only general statements in long meetings monday and 
tuesday not concrete proposals 
slyunkov who leads a delegation of communist party and 
government officials also addressed 30000 people tuesday in the 
main square of prokopievsk 2100 miles east of moscow 
he promised to increase the areas regular food supplies by 20 
to 30 percent as well as soap and washing powder then toured the 
city to inspect living conditions legachev said 
izvestia the government newspaper said slyunkov promised higher 
pay for night work longer vacations and a doubling of the wholesale 
price of coal to pay for the benefits 
tass said he gave partial support to demands that most businesses 
in the region be allowed to sell some of their products outside the 
control of central agencies and ruled out halfmeasures in 
responding to the strikers 
officials have said agreements made with the kuznetsk miners also 
would apply to those at donetsk in the ukraine 1450 miles south of 
moscow 
legachev the strike committee spokesman said slyunkovs 
promises lacked substance and the miners would stay out until all 
their demands were met 
we are determined to go on with the strike because they 
received no concrete documented response to their demands he 
said there were only general statements 
grimy miners in hard hats near a tent city in the prokopievsk 
square responded with a resounding nyet when asked by a 
television correspondent whether they were satisfied with slyunkovs 
offers 
a striker interviewed on the nightly news program vremya 
predicted the money needed to pay for concessions would be taken 
from the miners 
donetsk strike committee leader vladimir komissaruk reported the 
spread of the strike there in a telephone interview from makayevka 
vremya showed miners marching in a column in the donetsk basin 
miners in the ukranian coal fields demand 40 percent more pay for 
night work better living conditions fixed days off and retirement 
after 20 years of underground work they also want the coal mining 
ministry to trim its bureaucracy 
tass said authorities agreed to the donetsk demands for pay 
bonuses and longer vacations it also carried a report denying the 
strike had spread to the third major coal region karaganda in 
kazakhstan 
strikes are rare in the soviet union and were put down by force 
before mikhail s gorbachev gained power in march 1985 tass said a 
draft law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts was being 
rushed through the national legislature 
it said the law would furnish a legal basis for a resolution of 
labor conflicts including the coal strike

the united mine workers union and the 
pittston co agreed tuesday to resume contract talks under 
supervision of federal mediators in an effort to end a long and 
occasionally violent coalfield strike 
you just had the 20th anniversary of man landing on the moon 
that was a small step and this is just one small step said 
michael odom president of pittston coal group inc pittstons 
subsidiary 
a step is better than no step at all said umw president 
richard trumka 
talks will begin wednesday they agreed in a meeting called by a 
federal judge the two sides will meet in separate rooms at a 
duffield hotel with mediators shuttling proposals between them 
about 1900 umw members are striking pittston in a dispute over 
benefits and job security the strike began april 5 in virginia and 
west virginia before spreading to kentucky hundreds of miners have 
been arrested for a variety of violent incidents as well as civil 
disobedience tactics 
the walkout at pittston one of the few coal companies that 
didnt sign a national umw contract last year led to unauthorized 
sympathy walkouts beginning last month that affected up to 46000 
miners in 10 states 
most of those miners have since gone back to work but wildcat 
strikes still affect several thousand miners in west virginia where 
some shots were fired tuesday union officials in alabama told more 
than 3000 miners to return for tuesday nights shift at two 
companies after they failed to show up earlier in the day 
trumka said he would have preferred that the union and company 
meet facetoface but he said anything is better than the stalemate 
that began when previous talks with mediators collapsed in early 
june 
us district judge glen williams who brought the two men 
together for a fourhour meeting tuesday said trumka requested that 
the talks begin immediately he said odom insisted that the talks 
begin in separate rooms 
the two sides also disagreed on who will negotiate for the 
company trumka said he is obviously disappointed that pittston 
chairman paul douglas declined to participate in talks odom said 
the company would not be pressured into changing negotiators 
trumka said he will attend only wednesdays initial session and 
umw vice president cecil roberts will head the union negotiating 
team the minute paul douglas indicates a desire to participate i 
will be there trumka said 
odom would not say who would represent the company 
trumka said he isnt sure if the agreement to resume talks will 
prompt the strikers to return to work 
odom said the wildcat strikes showed that theres no comfort in 
a national contract 
negotiations between the two sides broke down june 8 the 
governors of virginia and west virginia had issued similar offers to 
mediate talks but pittston officials had declined them

the berlin philharmonic orchestra will wait until 
october to begin searching in earnest for a successor to maestro 
herbert von karajan and one critic suggested the process could take 
years 
karajan conductor of the philharmonic for 34 years died sunday 
at 81 
klaus geitel a respected music critic living in west berlin 
said other conductors could be tied up for years with longterm 
contracts elsewhere 
sure they could ask riccardo muti or someone else to take over 
for karajan he said but the big question is could they 
accept 
muti conducts the philadelphia orchestra and milans la scala 
bernd gellermann the berlin philharmonics business director 
said the orchestra is now on summer break and wont even try in 
earnest to find a replacement for karajan until october 
the berlin philharmonic is one of the worlds most famous 
orchestras its marriage to the celebrated karajan reflected its 
place in germanys heritage of musical excellence and composing 
geniuses like ludwig van beethoven and johann sebastian bach 
music fans suffered an initial shock in april when karajan 
announced he was ending his often stormy relationship with the 
orchestra they were buffeted a second time when karajan died 
he was buried monday night in a small ceremony in his hometown 
near salzburg austria 
musicians critics and fans already were wondering who would 
replace karajan after he resigned as the orchestras conductor for 
life 
orchestra musicians and administrators are highly secretive about 
possible heirs but they made it clear this week that only the best 
conductors in the world are in the running 
i could name nine or 10 people but i wont said rudolph 
watzel a double bass player in the berlin orchestra for 21 years 
the orchestras members make recommendations for karajans 
successor so watzel is in a position to know who the top candidates 
are 
gellermann said karajan will in any case be a hard act to follow 
the successor will be taking over an enormous legacy he said 
he said karajans replacement will come from a group of 
conductors who have already worked with the orchestra 
west german music writers say the frontrunners are guest 
conductors who have been on karajans podium during his absences due 
to illness or who have conducted the orchestra since he announced 
his resignation the orchestra may have to continue to rely on guest 
conductors during the search for a permanent conductor 
the berliner morgenpost newspaper said tuesday that the likely 
contenders to replace karajan include seiji ozawa of the boston 
symphony orchestra james levine of the metropolitan opera in new 
york and muti 
all have lifted the baton in karajans place in recent months 
guest conductors are a venerable tradition at the 107yearold 
philharmonic such musical giants as johannes brahms antonin 
dvorak richard strauss and peter tchaikovsky performed historic 
concerts with the orchestra in its early years 
karajans contemporaries have taken his place over the past few 
years when he missed performances because of chronic back problems 
medical treatment and generally declining health 
karajan had not conducted the berlin orchestra since dec 31 
1988

antiapartheid leader nelson mandela 
told his family during a fivehour birthday reunion tuesday that he 
wont be freed from prison this year his wife said 
his exact words were there will be no release definitely not 
this year winnie mandela said outside the victor verster prison 
farm north of cape town where the black african national congress 
leader is held 
some of the 16 members of mandelas family who observed his 71st 
birthday gave black power salutes as they walked out the prison 
gates where about 50 youths chanted viva mandela and sang 
songs in the intermittent rain and nearfreezing cold 
on his personal agenda his release will be the last item 
mrs mandela said he wants freedom for his political views 
she said he had asked for more freedom to discuss political 
matters with other leaders and wanted contact with black trade union 
officials 
whatever comrade mandela does is in full consultation with the 
leadership behind bars and the anc outside she said 
it was the 26th birthday mandela has spent behind bars since his 
arrest aug 5 1962 and the first one he has spent with his family 
he is serving a life prison term imposed in 1964 for sabotage and 
plotting to overthrow the government 
mandelas july 5 meeting with president pw botha had sparked 
widespread speculation the government might release him after sept 
6 parliamentary elections in which the black majority of 28 million 
have no vote 
mrs mandela also said national party leader fw de klerk 
designated to succeed botha after the elections was fully aware 
of the meeting 
some south african observers had interpreted de klerks lack of 
comment as a sign that botha facing forced retirement may have 
held the meeting to upstage his successor 
the family gathering included mandelas wife two sisters his 
son two daughters eight grandchildren a greatgrandson and 
daughterinlaw they came from the united states swaziland the 
black township of soweto near johannesburg and the xhosa tribal 
homeland where mandela was born 
makaziwe mandelaamuah mandelas daughter by his first marriage 
brought her three children to see her father including her 
4yearold son kweku who had never seen his grandfather 
although he stays in his own house he is still a prisoner and 
we would like to see him free very soon said mrs mandelaamuah 
who came from massachusetts where she is seeking a doctorate in 
anthropology at amherst college 
he will be lonely but he will be happy that he saw us all 
she said it will carry him through the rest of the year 
mrs mandela said her husband told her there was no specific 
significance to his meeting friday with five african national 
congress colleagues who were sentenced with him in 1964 for founding 
and participating in activities of the ancs armed wing

a federal regulatory noose threatens to choke 
future growth of us agriculture an american farm bureau 
federation economist said tuesday 
john k hosemann of chicago said it is not enough to have sound 
monetary tax and trade policies and then have a regulatory 
apparatus that is going in the opposite direction by jacking up the 
us cost of producing food and fiber 
hosemanns remarks were in a speech prepared for a meeting of the 
national economists club at the brookings institution 
cases in point farmers have been whipsawed by consumer scares 
about nitrates in bacon salmonella in chicken and milk to alar in 
apples he said all of these with little conclusive scientific 
basis but costly to farmers nonetheless 
hosemann said that each of the scares has fanned the fire 
that the us food system is unsafe 
to the extent that all of the hype over water and food purity 
leads to restrictions on the production and resource decisions by 
farmers we are not likely to become a growth industry he said 
right now he added decisions are being made in this town 
about the next farm law that are very likely to increase the 
farmers cost of doing business we do not have research to 
respond to the simple question can us farmers compete 
internationally under alternative environmental restrictions on the 
use of farm resources 
hosemann said his views were personal and not the official views 
of the federation 
a new farm bill should keep the american farmer competitive in 
the world market and avoid goitalone decisions for curbing 
production he said the united states also should keep fighting the 
european economic community and japan for market access 
hosemann urged also that monetary fiscal trade and regulatory 
policies be consistent with economic growth 
if i have a central message it is that farming always has been 
and always will be a lot more than the price of hogs he said

the united states and soviet union have reached 
agreement on key issues for a chemical weapons ban officials said 
tuesday but they also said a global treaty is not at hand 
ambassador max friedersdorf the head of the us delegation to 
the 40nation conference on disarmament told the associated press 
in geneva that the superpowers made progress in the latest round of 
talks but thats a long way from completing a treaty 
added friedersdorf i dont think there is any reason to be 
euphoric 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher said the two 
nations which have the worlds largest arsenals of chemical 
weapons are holding bilateral discussions on technical issues 
relating to a worldwide ban 
their recommendations will be given to the multinational 
conference which has been meeting in switzerland on and off for the 
past eight years 
boucher said russian and american negotiators have settled 
differences on spot inspections of chemical weapons sites and on the 
order in which weapons would be destroyed over a 10year period 
once a treaty goes into effect 
negotiators have arrived at joint texts ready for review in 
the two capitals on those issues boucher said friedersdorf said 
the paper on inspections has already been sent to washington for 
review 
while these discussions have been productive there have 
been no major breakthroughs and much work remains to be done 
boucher said 
the new york times which first reported progress on the talks 
quoted an unidentified state department official as saying the two 
sides have agreed in principle on a mathematical formula 
prescribing the amounts and types of chemical weapons to be 
destroyed over a decade 
the task of verifying compliance with the treaty is widely 
considered the most difficult task facing negotiators 
inspections are part of verification but friedersdorf said 
verification involves a lot more than the conduct of a challenge 
inspection and bilateral data exchange 
president bush who has long supported a ban on chemical weapons 
told reporters aboard air force one on his way back from europe that 
verifying compliance is what has thwarted an agreement all along 
bush said he had yet to see any draft agreements but any 
progress would be a pleasant surprise 
officials said the superpowers have yet to resolve differences on 
the exchange of data boucher said the two sides are discussing how 
far in advance of a treaty agreement they should begin to provide 
each other with information 
the geneva protocol of 1925 adopted after poison gas in world 
war i caused 13 million casualties prohibits the use of chemical 
weapons but not their manufacture or stockpiling 
the 40 members of the disarmament conference include iran and 
the 28 observers include iraq syria and libya all of which are 
thought to have chemical weapons capabilities 
for any treaty to be effective boucher said a substantial 
number all the major players would have to be part of this

the democraticcontrolled senate reflecting 
lingering political fallout from the irancontra affair voted 
tuesday to forbid a president from soliciting foreign or private 
funds to carry out foreign policy activities prohibited by congress 
the amendment sponsored by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
passed 57 to 42 moynihan said the aim was to bar government 
officials from bending to pressure from superiors to conduct 
activities outlawed by congress 
but sen jesse helms rnc voting on the losing side 
protested that the amendment is a clear bald effort to usurp the 
foreign policy prerogatives of the president of the united states in 
a manner not allowed by the constitution he predicted that 
president bush will veto it 
the provision attached to pending legislation authorizing 46 
billion in spending for the state department and allied agencies 
would make violators subject to fines and jail terms of up to five 
years 
testimony before the congressional irancontra committees showed 
that the reagan administration had solicited millions of dollars 
from american citizens and from such nations as saudi arabia and 
brunei to circumvent a congressional ban on direct us aid to the 
contra rebels battling the marxist government of nicaragua 
onetime presidential aide oliver l north testified that he had 
helped arrange such unofficial assistance to the contras 
this amendment can be summed up in three words obey the 
law said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
mitchell noted that helms contends the president is fully 
empowered to pursue his policies by indirect means even when 
congress has outlawed a direct approach using us government funds 
the president of the united states is constrained by law just 
as is any american citizen mitchell said in disagreement 
this is a democracy not a monarchy the president is not a 
king he said 
this is a modest reasonable response to ensure there will be 
compliance with law mitchell said it will prevent officials of 
the government from having to choose between loyalty to the 
president and loyalty to the constitution this amendment says that 
if the law prohibits an act it is prohibited indirectly as well as 
directly 
but helms replied the opposition to this amendment can be 
summed up in three words obey the constitution 
he said that bush would be fully justified in vetoing the measure 
helms contended that in foreign policy issues congress has the 
power only of the purse with the ability to cut off government 
funds for a given activity but congress cannot bar a president from 
pursuing foreign policy by other means he said 
voting for the amendment were 53 democrats and four republicans 
one democrat and 41 republicans opposed it one senator did not vote

pandemonium reigned at las mercedes airport hundreds of people

roman catholic officials said tuesday they 
were disturbed by jewish protests at a convent operated by carmelite 
nuns beside the site of the auschwitz concentration camp they also 
said the convent would be moved 
but the officials in their first response to the demonstrations 
did not say when the convent would be relocated as jewish leaders 
are demanding 
in rome leaders of a jewish group met with vatican officials 
tuesday and asked that pope john paul ii intervene in the dispute 
they said their request was refused 
the group also met with the polish ambassador to seek the polish 
governments aid in the dispute 
polands official pap news agency quoted bronislaw fidelus 
deputy to cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow as saying the 
catholic community of the krakow diocese is disturbed by the 
incidents at the convent 
it is difficult to accept that the two latest incidents were 
led by a high official in the jewish clergy fidelus said 
on friday an american rabbi and six students held a fivehour 
sitin at the convent grounds they said the protest ended when 
convent workmen kicked and punched them and dragged them from the 
grounds no serious injuries were reported 
the rabbi avraham weiss of the hebrew institute in new york 
returned with four students sunday that protest ended four hours 
later without incident 
in their remarks tuesday church officials did not mention 
fridays scuffle 
a church statement carried by pap said land had been purchased 
for a religious center farther from the death campthe relocation 
would be in line with an agreement reached by 18 international 
catholic and jewish leaders but the statement did not way when the 
move might begin 
fidelus said in the center there will be room both spiritual 
and physical for the carmelite sisters and for any other 
initiatives which will together show the religious dimension of the 
memory of the auschwitz tragedy 
the agreedupon date for moving the convent from a former nazi 
warehouse that is within feet of the auschwitz guard towers passed 
feb 22 without any action 
fidelus said work on the center was about to start on a tract in 
the same town of oswiecim but away from the grounds of auschwitz 
an estimated 4 million people including 25 million jews 
perished at the auschwitz camp from 1940 to 1945 about 6 million 
jews were killed in the nazi holocaust 
many jews consider the convent an affront to the memory of the 
jews who died in auschwitz 
in rome one of the jewish leaders who met with vatican officials 
criticized elements in the catholic church in poland a 
predominantly roman catholic country 
there are some elements in the church in poland that dont want 
to settle this problem said rabbi marvin hier what is at stake 
is much more than a small issue but the entire 40year dialogue 
between the church and the jewish people it cannot be looked upon 
as a local matter 
the jewish officials who went to rome belong to the los 
angelesbased simon wiesenthal center which focuses on holocaust 
issues 
they said they had sought the help of the polishborn pope in 
moving the convent 
they vatican officials told us the pope has made the decision 
to absent himself from deliberations and that the issue should be 
settled by the church in poland said hier who serves as dean of 
the simon wiesenthal center 
hier and three other group leaders met with monsignor luigi 
gatti an official in the vatican secretariat of state and 
monsignor gerard daucourt of the vaticans office for relations with 
jews 
vatican officials confirmed the meeting took place but released 
no details 
the meeting was basically very disappointing hier said it 
was very frustrating to learn that the one person who can settle the 
problem the pope is not involved by his own decision 
the jewish officials also said they met tuesday with josef 
wiegacz polands ambassador in rome and asked for the polish 
governement to press the church on the convent issue 
the polish embassy made no immediate statement about the meeting

president bush home after a 10day trip to 
europe said tuesday he sensed the dawning of an age behind the iron 
curtain in which freedom and democracy flourish for others as they 
have for this great country of ours 
returning to the white house the president was cheered by 
thousands including members of his cabinet and tourists pulled from 
lines waiting to see the executive mansion 
visibly tired by his whirlwind trip four countries in 10 days 
bush said he had found an enormous amount of excitement in 
poland and hungary 
he recounted some of the memories he will take from the trip 
the open arms of the people of poland american flags waving in 
the sqaure at the lenin shipyard in gdansk the faces of the people 
who lined the streets greeting us with such joy the thousands who 
endured a driving downpour in budapest to welcome us to hungary 
the warmth that barbara and i felt as a reflection of the 
warmth the people of poland and hungary feel for america snd for our 
ideals 
his trip behind the iron curtain bush said left him sensing 
there is a new world within our reach a world where the yearning 
for freedom overcomes discord and confrontation where freedom and 
democracy flourish for others as they have for this great country of 
ours 
minutes later meeting with cabinet members in the oval office 
bush extolled the achievements of the weekend paris economic summit 
at which he helped to chart a campaign to preserve the global 
environment 
flying back from europe bush said earlier in the day that the 
high point of his trip may have been the presentation to him by 
hungarian prime minister miklos nemeth of a plaque containing 
fragments of a barbed wire fence that had stood between the 
communist nation and neutral austria as probably the highlight of 
his 9000mile trip 
i think when nemeth handed me that barbed wire gets pretty 
close to it bush said to reporters traveling with him on air 
force one 
i love our country so much that when people express their love 
of america by their tears which we saw among some of the older 
people in almost every place that moved me a lot he added 
or he said the high point may have been standing with lech 
walesa the leader of the polish trade union solidarity at a 
towering memorial to slain workers in gdansk 
there were so many wonderful things bush said 
as for the future of moves toward democracy and freemarket 
economies in hungary and poland bush said he felt there was too 
much hope too much optimism for those movements to be quelched by 
moscow 
in both countries reform movements were crushed in hungary in 
1956 and in poland in 1970 but bush said he did not think fear of 
the soviet union or communism could reverse the trends underway now 
in poland and hungary 
theyre not dwelling on that bush said of past soviet moves 
theres too much hope too much optimism its such a concern 
still there but its overpowered by the moves going on there 
the closest thing to a hitch on the presidents trip was a lively 
discussion with dutch parliamentarians at the us embassy in the 
hague before heading home the meeting which bush said bordered on 
an argument dealt with the environment arms control eastwest 
relations and western assistance to the third world 
many in the dutch opposition want their government and the united 
states to take a more liberal stance on such matters 
bush was the first us president to pay an official visit to the 
netherlands which first established ties with america in 1782 he 
received a warm welcome there drawing cheering crowds of several 
thousand people along his motorcade route 
referring to the quickening reform in poland and hungary he told 
some 250 workers at the us embassy in the hague i cant think 
of a more exciting time in postwar history 
bush also said he was troubled by a new book that suggests vice 
president dan quayle lacks the competence required by his job 
this is the ugly side of politics bush said as he defended 
quayles qualifications and his own judgment aboard air force one on 
the flight home 
the trip added to the image of bush as a globetrotter but he 
said he did not have imageenhancement in mind by traveling 
abroad he said he had been concentrating on foreign affairs since 
the early 1970s 
its amazing he said the respect for the united states 
around the world i think its still very very strong very 
strong 
bush will pass the sixmonth mark in office thursday asked on 
air force one how he feels about that semianniversary the 
president replied 
youre asking me on a good day ask me tomorrow after we go 
back and wrestle with some of these domestic problems 
in his first six months as president ronald reagan ventured 
outside the country only once to neighboring canada 
jimmy carter visited only two countries britain and switzerland 
in his first six months 
bush on the other hand went to canada three weeks after taking 
power 
barely a month in office he flew to asia for the funeral of 
emperor hirohito in tokyo and then stopped in china and south korea 
late in may bush went to italy stopped in brussels belgium for 
a nato summit and traveled to west germany and britain 
aside from his foreign travel bush also has been busy 
crisscrossing the united states the white house says he has 
visited 26 states since his inauguration 
and he wont be sitting still for long bush is expected to make 
a twoday trip beginning july 28 to chicago las vegas and tennessee

senators and legal scholars argued tuesday over 
whether a constitutional amendment was political patronizing or 
the best american way to overcome a supreme court decision allowing 
flag burning 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan introduced the 
constitutional amendment supported by president bush and belittled 
the idea championed by judiciary committee chairman joseph biden 
ddel that the way to overcome the decision was a simple statute 
satisfying the courts concerns about free speech rights 
there is no guarantee that the biden bill will 
constitutionalize the federal flag desecration statute we 
will have to wait perhaps three to five years for the courts to put 
their stamp of approval or rejection on the statute thats simply 
too long for the american people to wait dole said 
sen strom thurmond rsc ranking republican on the judiciary 
committee said he thought a constitutional amendment was the only 
sound and safe way to protect the flag 
but sen bob kerrey dneb a vietnam veteran and medal of honor 
winner said lawmakers were jumping too quickly to push 
flagprotection legislation in order to gain political capital 
kerrey said that while he was outraged by the decision he 
has come to believe there was no necessity to pass new legislation 
reading the decision i was suprised to discover it was 
reasonable understandable and consistent with those values which i 
believe have made america so wonderful 
and the dissenting opinion of chief justice william rehnquist he 
said might impose a functional litmus test of loyalty before 
expression is permitted 
today i declare that i dont support any of the constitutional 
amendments which are being offered by my colleagues he said 
adding that even passage of new antiflag burning statutes might be 
more patronizing than necessary 
kerrey said the constitutional amendments create problems 
rather than solving them and harvard university law professor 
laurence tribe delivered a similar message to the house subcommittee 
on constitutional law 
there are many patriotic americans who believe that the 
toughest but best way to show respect for the flag to show why we 
are so different from those in beijing who massacre protesters is 
to protect even the freedom of those who would desecrate this symbol 
of our freedom he said 
tribe said that could be accomplished through a statute like 
bidens which would make it a federal crime punishable by a fine 
of up to 1000 and a years imprisonment or both for someone to 
knowingly deface the flag 
the statute would remove all references in the existing federal 
flag burning statute to ideas communicated in the process of 
flag desecration and would punish only the physical act itself 
the supreme court held in its 54 ruling in the texas case that 
desecrating the flag was protected under the constitutions first 
amendment guarantee of free speech insofar as the act of destroying 
the flag amounted to communicating a political point of view 
tribe urged the lawmakers to count votes on the supreme court 
like they do in congress assuring them that changing a properly 
drafted statute would win over a majority of the court and as many 
as seven justices 
i submit thats the response that best protects the flag he 
said without running the risk that an amendment could rip the 
heart out of the first amendment 
walter dellinger of duke university urged congress not to touch 
the constitution because of the texas flagburning case of gregory 
johnson 
johnson will have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of his 
fetid imagination if congress reacts so strongly 
he will have succeeded in making the greatest nation on earth 
if we give him this amendment look just a little silly a little 
less brave and a little less free he said 
but republicans on the subcommittee expressed increasing 
impatience with those resisting a constitutional amendment 
whats the reticence about amending the us constitution 
asked rep william dannemeyer rcalif in my opinion the flag is 
not a light or idle cause 
rep craig james rfla criticized all this hoopla about we 
shouldnt amend the constitution when he said the court itself 
regularly amended it 
paul kamenar of the washington legal foundation said he believed 
the court ruled incorrectly but now a constitutional amendment was 
the only way to proceed he said that could be done without hurting 
first amendment rights 
the proposed amendment properly understood is not an 
amendment to the first amendment but merely overturns the courts 
judicial amendment to the constitution he said it would simply 
put the law back where it was the day before the decision was 
rendered 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash plans to bring to the 
full house an antiflagburning statute possibly before the august 
recess but has not scheduled any action on a constitutional 
amendment in the senate majority leader george mitchell has 
scheduled action in october on both approaches

attorney ervin lee has been known to accept 
chickens from financially strapped farmers as payment for his advice 
in exchange for taking the reduced payment lee of minot gets 
free legal research and information from the states farm law 
project 
cash is always better lee said this week but if people 
can afford to pay whatever i believe thats whats important 
two agencies north dakota legal services and legal assistance of 
north dakota founded the farm law project in 1985 to provide free 
resources for lawyers who agree to represent north dakota farmers at 
reduced rates 
until recently very few attorneys concentrated on agricultural 
law said jason coffel a spokesman for the project but now 
since last years drought and the fallingout of the agriculture 
economy its become a necessity 
jim fitzsimmons director of north dakota legal services said 
the project helped both poor farmers who need legal advice and 
attorneys who have questions about farm law 
a lot of farmers dont go to lawyers he said what were 
trying to do is generate a body of attorneys who will work with farm 
clients 
under the farm law project minot attorney paul temanson conducts 
background research for cases and provides uptodate information on 
farmrelated law through newsletters and public forums he also 
works directly on some cases 
attorneys who use the service reduce their fees however they see 
fit fitzsimmons said adding sometimes its unbelievable they 
dont charge a thing 
one of the farm law projects more notable cases is a 1987 
lawsuit against the farmers home administration that contests the 
agencys practice of confiscating government crop subsidy payments 
of some farmers who are in debt to the agency while a ruling is 
pending there has been a nationwide moratorium on such 
confiscations 
the farm law project is unique to north dakota and assists as 
many as 350 attorneys each year fitzsimmons said he had no precise 
figures on the number of farmers who benefit from the information 
comments about the project have been generally positive 
fitzsimmons said attorneys ive heard from say dont let this 
thing go he said 
its important to have somebody watching one specific area and 
making that information readily available lee said 
coffel said the project which is financed by private grants 
costs between 35000 and 42000 a year two grants expire sept 1 
but a 7500 emergency grant from the otto bremer foundation of st 
paul minn should carry the project through the end of the year 
he said 
despite the projects tight finances right now coffel said he 
was not too worried about obtaining grant money for 1990 
im confident about the program he said i have every 
reason to believe its going to be up and running again next year

the nations high rate of infant deaths could 
be cut along with million of dollars spent to care for premature 
babies with a communitybased program of home visitors said a 
report tuesday by a government commission 
the national commission to prevent infant mortality envisions a 
system based on those used extensively in other countries in which 
health visitors visit pregnant women in their homes to instruct them 
in good prenatal care and offer support services such as driving 
them to doctors appointments 
the cost of a resource mother could be as low as 100 per 
pregnancy compared with 30000 and more to care for a baby born 
prematurely and 400000 and more in that childs lifetime for 
medical care and special services said former sen lawton chiles 
dfla chairman of the commission 
we are currently operating under a misguided principle we 
have developed the best medicine in the world to care for babies 
born too early and too small chiles said in a statement 
accompanying the report 
home health visitors would let us work at the front end to 
prevent these babies from being born at risk he said 
an estimated onethird of all pregnant women receive inadequate 
prenatal care the commission said in 1986 more than 70000 
pregnant women received no prenatal care at all 
inadequate prenatal care is linked to high rates of infant 
deaths and low birthweight babies who are 40 times more likely to 
die in their first month of life and two to three times more likely 
to develop chronic handicapping conditions the commission said 
a house measure includes about 14 million in fiscal 1990 for 
development of new home visiting programs and support for existing 
programs sen bill bradley dnj said he plans to offer an 
amendment that would earmark 15 million to 20 million for home 
visiting programs 
under a home visiting program women in a community would be 
trained and paid a minimum wage to go to the homes of pregnant teens 
and women in their community and instruct them on the importance of 
prenatal care including good nutrition and quitting smoking and 
drug use 
such programs are used extensively in european countries all of 
which have lower infant mortality rates than the united states 
which ranks 19th among industrialized nations in the world the 
commission said 
an estimated 4500 home visiting programs are operating in the 
united states many funded by churches and community organizations

five astronauts boarded the space 
shuttle columbia on tuesday to wrap up a twoday dress rehearsal of 
next months planned launch that turned up no significant problems 
nasa officials said 
the test allowed shuttle workers to check the shuttles 
electrical systems at the launch pad and gave columbias crew a 
chance to interact with flight controllers at the kennedy space 
center and at mission control at the johnson space center in texas 
it sets the stage for final launch preparations and the launch 
of columbia in the first week of august said nasa spokesman 
george diller 
this exercise is designed to be a highfidelity test in large 
part a carbon copy of what will be occuring on launch day were 
coming out with a very good test said diller 
shuttle managers will not announce a firm launch date until july 
26 when they complete a flight readiness review 
nasa is conducting the secret mission for the department of 
defense and military space experts believe the astronauts will 
deploy an advanced reconnaissance satellite 
the practice session covers the final 24 hours of an actual space 
shuttle countdown 
this is as much a people test as it is a test for the space 
shuttle itself diller explained it is a good opportunity to 
bring out any bugs in all of the procedures that will be used when 
columbia is launched next month

thousands of armed men roamed an ethnically 
troubled black sea region tuesday where at least 16 people have been 
killed and 239 injured in three days of gunfights kidnappings and 
beatings officials reported 
a national interior ministry official said some of the 3000 
ministry soldiers patrolling the abkhazia region in soviet georgia 
formed a human barrier between georgians and abkhazians who earlier 
fought two battles along the galidze river 
the situation is very serious because so many people have 
guns said vladislav g ardzinba a national legislator from 
sukhumi capital of abkhazia where both georgians and abkhazians 
claim discrimination by the other 
many people in the region have shotguns or hunting rifles and 
several reports said mobs looted firearms including automatic 
weapons from police stations and jails 
a high official in sukhumi said snipers fired at the local 
communist party and interior ministry buildings and other armed men 
cut road and rail transport and some communications with the area 
870 miles south of moscow 
in effect they are spreading terror he said by telephone 
deputy interior minister ivan f shilov said on the national 
television news show vremya that 16 people had been killed and 239 
injured 188 of whom were hospitalized 
he said the most volatile situation tuesday was near ochamchira 
on the coast south of sukhumi where the soldiers were acting as a 
barrier between georgians and abkhazians 
zarya vostoka a georgian newspaper said 5000 people were armed 
in the sukhumi area on sunday night and there were exchanges of 
gunfire 
violence was reported in tkvarcheli gulripsh gali and gudauta 
in abkhazia and in zugdide in western georgia the official news 
agency tass said authorities had confiscated more than 300 weapons 
prisoners freed by a mob from a jail in zugdide may be among the 
armed marauders tass said only 14 of the 180 prisoners had been 
recaptured 
ardzinba the national legislator from sukhumi said the riots 
started saturday with the beating of an abkhazian the georgian 
foreign ministry said earlier the violence began when abkhazians 
attacked georgians 
the legislator said many abkhazians want the 3320squaremile 
region where georgians outnumber them 240000 to 94000 to become 
a a 16th soviet republic 
tass said there were no riots monday but the official in sukhumi 
gave a different picture

president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday suggested 
that a congress of the communist party scheduled for 1991 be moved 
up to next year that would give him another chance to remove more 
oldtimers opposed to reforms 
the official tass news agency said gorbachev made the proposal at 
a meeting with communist party chiefs from the 15 soviet republics 
and from territorial and regional party committees it said he 
recommended that the 28th communist party congress be held in the 
fall of 1990 
tass reported gorbachev rejected calls to hold an emergency party 
congress in addition to the one scheduled for 1991 on grounds that 
many major political events are already on the calendar among the 
events he listed are a a meeting of the partys policymaking 
central committee the second session of the new congress of 
peoples deputies the soviet parliament and local elections 
the central committee meeting is expected to be held this summer 
the congress of peoples deputies session will open in october and 
the elections are set for next spring 
gorbachev has increased the pace of political reform since taking 
office as communist party general secretary at the last party 
congress in 1985 he became president last october and could 
strengthen his power base with a party congress 
the congress would give gorbachev an opportunity to revamp the 
central committee beyond changes made in april at a central 
committee meeting at that meeting he engineered the retirement of 
110 senior officials including many holdovers from the era of the 
late president leonid i brezhnev blamed for leading the country 
into an economic and political morass 
in april the central committee promoted many nonvoting members 
to full voting status but was not empowered to bring in new members 
that is the exclusive job of a party congress 
several important party officials allied with gorbachev are not 
central committee members and he could bring them aboard at the 
party congress they include the party chiefs in the ethnic hotspots 
of lithuania latvia and estonia in the baltics and armenia and 
azerbaijan in the caucasus 
in a speech at tuesdays meeting gorbachev said the 20 
millionmember party was lagging behind the progress being made in 
soviet society and it could lose its leading position

a former congressman who recently returned from 
pakistan said tuesday that members of the afghan resistance would be 
willing to link release of soviet prisoners to the release of 
americans held in indochina 
william m hendon chairman of the pow publicity fund in mclean 
va said the warm reception by the mujahedeen during an initial 
visit to their base in peshawar pakistan led him to return with 
relatives of servicemen who have been missing since as early as 1961 
what weve accomplished is the biggest deal since the end of 
the war said hendon whose fund was set up to offer a 25 
million reward to anyone who escapes defects and brings an american 
pow to freedom 
they have indicated a clear desire to help and they are in 
a position to help said hendon from asheville nc thats the 
exciting thing about it 
hendon and the relatives have been in washington this week to 
talk about their weeklong trip from which they returned saturday 
he said he would ask congress to support further arms shipments 
to fight the kabul government although the mujahedeen did not make 
that a condition of help 
they said that their islamic teaching and their genuine 
compassion for our men and they view this as a humanitarian gesture 
to help their friends the americans he said we believe 
that the way we can help them the most is to help them win the war 
that they have fought for 11 years now that they have suffered 15 
million casualties they have 45000 of their own people disappeared 
or missing 
hendon said he that the idea came to him after reading an article 
in the aug 19 1988 issue of asiaweek magazine during a flight 
over laos the article about afghanistan mentioned the strong desire 
of the soviets to recover their prisoners taken in the civil war in 
that country 
that and other news accounts mentioned how intent the soviets 
were on winning the release of the prisoners the soviet government 
was even sending delegations of ordinary men and women to plead for 
the release of the prisoners he said 
hendon said he initially met in june with two fundamentalist 
leaders burhanuddin rabbani and gulbuddin hekmatyar and other 
top leaders of the resistance 
the group then met with dr zabihullah mojadeddi general 
secretary of the afghan national liberation front and others 
hendon said 
they said to us directly we will help said one of the 
relatives beth stewart of washington dc there were no hollow 
statements no platitudes 
theyve lived what weve lived for many many years because of 
their own losses said beth bischoff of wilson nc 
ms stewarts father and mrs bischoffs fatherinlaw are 
missing in southeast asia 
the state department says it has received no reports from 
islamabad about such a possibility a small number of prisoners was 
exchanged last fall and there have been periodic meetings 
although nothing would be wrong with a threeway deal a state 
department source said pows are considered a humanitarian issue 
meaning they should not be part of political negotiations that lead 
to a settlement 
the pentagon had no comment on the proposal said lt col keith 
schneider a spokesman i have no idea what the possibilities 
are he said 
the official government position is that it is unable to prove 
the existence of pows in vietnam although it wont rule out the 
possibility the number of americans unaccounted for in southeast 
asia is 2348

the house passed farm legislation tuesday 
accompanied by a report calling for further study of red dye no 3 
before any ban on the food additive as a cancercausing substance 
however the chairman of the committee that submitted the bill 
said the government was not bound to hold off on such a ban 
rep jamie whitten dmiss said his committees report seeking 
more study of the dye that gives maraschino cherries their brilliant 
color does not legally require the food and drug administration to 
leave it on the market 
his statements came in response to questions from rep ted weiss 
dny during debate over the 421 billion appropriations bill for 
rural development agriculture and related agencies which includes 
the fda 
the bill which sets spending for the fiscal year beginning oct 
1 was approved 39426 
in 1960 when congress called for a ban on foods that cause 
cancer in laboratory animals red dye no 3 and others were put on a 
provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market for an 
additional two years pending further study 
weiss who chairs a house government operations subcommittee that 
has held hearings on the issue said during the debate since 
1962 the fda has given the industry somewhere between 30 and 40 
extensions of the provisional listing of red dye no 3 
fda scientists have concluded that red dye no 3 causes 
cancer he added the ostensible grounds for further study 
outlined in the committees report to test the socalled 
secondary mechanism of the dye have already been studied and 
dismissed in 1987 by a panel of expert government scientists in a 
100plus page report 
weiss contended under the law the fda has no option but to 
follow through with its stated intentions to terminate the 
provisional listing of red dye no 3 it is high time that it do 
so 
large doses of the additive have caused tumors in rats leading 
consumer groups to demand that it be banned 
the language about further tests was put in the report on the 
appropriations bill after requests by growers and canners who would 
like to postpone action against the dye 
the wall street journal reported monday that fda commissioner 
frank young said his office worked with proponents of the provision 
he has maintained that the additive doesnt pose a health threat 
the report says the appropriations committee expects the food 
and drug administration to provide the technical expertise necessary 
for a longterm study to determine if the secondary mechanism 
effect can be confirmed for red dye no 3 
the committee further expects the food and drug administration 
to review the results of this study in addition to any other 
scientifically based findings which may emerge prior to making any 
decision relating to changes in the provisionally or permanently 
approved uses of this color 
the secondary mechanism refers to arguments that the dye is 
not a primary cause of cancer and causes tumors only when used in 
doses higher than would ever be consumed through its use as a food 
coloring 
the appropriations bill covers spending for all agriculture 
programs including research extension services animal and plant 
inspections crop insurance commodity credit corp and conservation 
programs 
it also covers rural development programs such as the farmers 
home administration rural development insurance fund and rural 
electrification administration nutrition programs including food 
stamps women infant and children food supplements and food for 
the needy fall under the legislation as do foreign agriculture 
service programs

asked for a big hamburger 
we had your basic large hamburger but these guys were 
hungry ms wasserburger recalled

communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
reversed course tuesday and announced he would be a candidate for 
the new post of president of poland 
the president will be picked wednesday by the national assembly 
polands twochambered legislature 
solidarity lawmakers decided overwhelmingly tuesday night to 
permit union legislators to follow their consciences when they vote 
for or against jaruzelski 
i think it was a good decision said deputy bronislaw 
geremek chairman of the solidarity parliamentary group after a 
long emotional debate on jaruzelskis candidacy only 38 union 
lawmakers wanted to require party discipline in the vote 
the solidaritybacked delegation makes up 46 percent of the 
assembly and most seemed likely to vote against jaruzelski who 
imposed a martial law crack down on the independent trade union in 
1981 
but geremek indicated jaruzelski would win even without 
solidarity support 
i can say gen jaruzelski should be elected by the votes of 
the coalition he said 
the communist coalition has 300 of the 560 votes in the national 
assembly and solidarity has 259 one seat was left open by the 
death of a solidarity legislator 
jerzy stepien a solidarity senator from kielce said during the 
debate lets not be afraid of confrontation it is bound to 
happen 
jaruzelski said a sense of duty drove him to change his mind 
after announcing june 30 he would not run because he was linked more 
with martial law than with current democratic changes 
the communist party leadership asked jaruzelski to reconsider and 
he said he was swayed by support from the two allied parties of the 
communist coalition and other groups 
an announcement by solidarity leader lech walesa that he would 
cooperate with jaruzelski as president and words of praise from 
president bush during a visit last week also appear to have helped 
persuade him 
jaruzelski said the decision was difficult but many emphasized to 
him the need for continuity and stability in polands government and 
international position 
it was commonly stressed that avoidance of responsibility in 
such a special moment would be in contradiction to the duties of a 
politician and a soldier and to the logic of my public service in 
the recent years jaruzelski said 
the president will appoint the next government which must deal 
with a disintergrating food market and skyrocketing inflation that a 
new report shows headed for an annual rate of 160 percent 
the solidarity lawmakers said jaruzelski did little to help his 
cause during a sixhour questioning monday by their delegation 
failing to repudiate the martial law that imprisoned some among them 
i feel he is responsible for all of the mistakes he is 
responsible so i cannot support him said zofia kuratowska a 
deputy speaker of the senate 
jan litynski a deputy for walbrzych said the caucus was divided 
between those who simply wanted to block jaruzelski from becoming 
president and those who see him as the lesser evil among other 
possible candidates 
solidarity lawmakers could vote against jaruzelski or vote to 
abstain they could also simply not participate which would help 
jaruzelski by reducing the votes he needs to win 
ten to 15 solidarity lawmakers will take that option litynski 
predicted 
a simple majority of those present will elect the president who 
can serve up to two sixyear terms and control polands military and 
foreign relations 
jaruzelski said opposition to him is understandable 
inseparably linked with openness and democratization of political 
life and acknowledged he could lose the vote 
jaruzelskis success appeared to depend on how well the communist 
coalition could maintain internal discipline 
wednesdays vote was to be an open roll call which should make 
it easier for the communists and allied peasant and democratic 
parties to insist that each lawmaker vote for jaruzelski 
some members of the communist and peasant parties were elected 
with solidarity support and it was not clear if they could support 
a jaruzelski candidacy 
according to the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza jaruzelski 
has told solidarity leaders he felt encouraged to run by statements 
at the july 78 meeting of warsaw pact allies in bucharest and the 
stance backing him taken by the polish military leadership 
jaruzelski moved to restore solidaritys legal status this year 
after a sevenyear ban he argued that dialogue must be carried on 
with all social forces in order to help poland out of its economic 
crisis 
after talks that ended in april authorities agreed to admit the 
opposition to parliament through partially democratic elections the 
freest held in poland since world war ii 
solidarity was restored to legal status april 17 and in june it 
won all but one of the 261 seats open to it in the new senate and 
the sejm or parliament

the energy department said tuesday it will 
decide within two weeks when to restart the first of three 
deactivated nuclear reactors in south carolina that are the nations 
only source of a gas needed to make nuclear weapons 
john tuck the undersecretary of energy told reporters the 
department was in the final stages of working out details of a 
restart timetable with westinghouse savannah river which operates 
the savannah river reactors under a federal contract 
within a couple of weeks not far beyond the first of august 
the restart date will be set he said adding that the timetable 
would be coupled with announcement of a broader plan for ensuring 
safer and cleaner operation of the plant 
the three savannah river reactors near aiken sc are the sole 
source of tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that is needed 
in the manufacture of thermonuclear warheads the three were closed 
down last year for technical and safety reasons 
early resumption of tritium production is considered crucial 
because supplies are falling the material must be periodically 
replaced in weapons in order to maintain their effectiveness the 
exact size of the tritium stockpile is classified but the pentagon 
said earlier this year that a supply squeeze was imminent 
tuck commented after testifying before a special panel of the 
house armed services committee that is assessing a variety of 
problems at the nuclear weapons complex which includes 17 major 
facilities in 12 states these plants design test and produce 
nuclear weapons and are operated by private companies under federal 
contract 
tuck said energy secretary james d watkins is strongly opposed 
to a bill sponsored by sen timothy wirth dcolo and a companion 
bill in the house sponsored by rep ron wyden dore that would 
transfer authority for studying the health effects of radiation on 
workers to the department of health and human services 
tuck said watkins wanted to retain that authority within his 
department 
to excuse doe from the responsibility of conducting 
epidemiologic surveys of its work force would be to excuse it from a 
key element of its responsibility to protect the health and safety 
of its workers tuck said 
wirth said the energy department should not be trusted to assess 
the health effects of radiation since it is a promoter of nuclear 
energy and weapons production 
this appearance of the fox guarding the chicken coop has 
inevitably led to a dramatic failure to win employee and public 
confidence in the health research conducted by doe wirth said 
tuck said watkins also was opposed to legislation that would 
broaden the powers of a newly created defense nuclear facilities 
safety board an independent group that will oversee the weapons 
program it is expected to start functioning this fall

the state department said tuesday it has asked 
france to clarify reports that paris is seeking to sell sensitive 
rocket technology to brazil a country with military trade links to 
libya 
so far the french foreign ministry has not yet said what if 
anything has been approved for transfer to brazil said richard 
boucher the department spokesman 
the washington times quoting unidentified officials in a story 
published tuesday said the french embassy in brasilia has notified 
the us embassy there that france has granted preliminary approval 
for the transfer of technology relating to the viking liquidfuel 
rocket engine which is used to propel the french ariane 
spacelaunch missile 
the transfer could be in violation of the missile technology 
control regime signed in 1987 by several countries including france 
and the united states 
boucher said the regime states there is a strong presumption 
against the transfer of sensitive rocket technology which is 
classified as category one 
if france were to transfer a category one rocket paris would 
have to require that it not be transferred without the consent of 
the french government boucher said 
he also said the united states has in the past raised with the 
brazilians its concerns about military trade with libya a country 
the united states has accused of inciting acts of terrorism 
but boucher said the supposition that french rocket technology 
will flow to libya is merely speculation

fundamentalist afghan insurgents 
acknowledged monday they killed members of a rival guerrilla 
faction they were responding to reports that they ambushed and 
executed 30 men from the other group 
rebel sources said the two factions are involved in a power 
struggle that could hinder efforts to overthrow the sovietsponsored 
afghan government 
reacting monday to the earlier reports of killings on july 9 in 
takhar province 140 miles north of kabul bush administration 
officials deplored the action but said us support of the afghan 
guerrillas would continue 
our commitment to support the mujahedeen is very clear and the 
nature and character of our support is unchanged and it will 
continue state department spokesman richard boucher said the 
guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
the dead including seven field commanders belonged to the 
jamiateislami guerrillas jamiat said the ambush was carried out 
by the rival hezbeislami of gulbuddin hekmatyar a hardline 
antiamerican fundamentalist 
jamiat spokesman mohammad shaoib said five people were killed in 
the ambush and 25 were executed later qaribur rehman saeed 
spokesman for hezbeislami denied anyone was executed but 
acknowledged some members of jamiat were killed 
saeed did not say how many were killed and said his group was 
investigating 
the struggle for power among guerrilla groups is almost as old as 
the afghan civil war which began after a communist coup in april 
1978 guerrilla sources say scores of men have been killed 
those slain in the latest incident were from afghanistans 
northern provinces of badakhshan kunduz takhar and baghlan and 
were returning from a strategy meeting with jamiat commander ahmed 
shah masoud shaoib said 
shaoib gave no details of the ambush or executions it is a 
great loss for all afghanistan especially for the north he said 
in the northern provinces there are only two powers jamiat 
and hezb said saeed the hezbeislami spokesman many of our 
commanders have been killed by masouds people 
masoud formed a northern council to incorporate guerrillas 
belonging to the seven rebel parties based in pakistan in a message 
to his headquarters in peshawar more than one year ago he said he 
was consolidating forces and establishing an islamic army 
the conflict started right from the beginning when masoud 
wanted the upper hand in the north saeed said masoud wanted to 
clear the area of hezb mujahedeen 
according to saeed masoud agreed to temporary ceasefires with 
soviet troops when the red army was involved in the afghan war and 
the guerrillas fought among themselves when hezbeislami forces 
refused to recognize those arrangements 
soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from 
afghanistan on feb 15 after nine years of involvement in the war 
sources independent of either group said they feared the internal 
conflict would cripple guerrilla efforts to capture 
governmentcontrolled cities in the north 
a moderate insurgent also speaking privately said masouds 
forces could not approach kabul the afghan capital because 
hezbeislami blocked them in central parwan province 
in kabul on tuesday the government said soldiers sealed off and 
searched the capitals southern sector tuesday after reports that 
guerrillas were planning to infiltrate 
on monday air force fighter jets bombed rebel bases near the 
eastern city of jalalabad killing at least 78 guerrillas and 
wounding 114 foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani told 
reporters in kabul 
he said the rebel bases were around surkhdewar 77 miles from 
kabul the report could not be confirmed independently 
tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled out at dawn tuesday 
to erect road blocks around the southern district home to about 
onefifth of kabuls 25 million people 
amani said the search lasted five hours but gave no details

citing problems with the use of classified 
material prosecutors on tuesday requested a delay in the 
irancontra case against a former cia station chief charged with 
obstruction and lying 
the trial of joseph fernandez was scheduled to start july 24 but 
a change in the cias position regarding certain classified 
information may substantially complicate the case prosecutors 
said in court papers 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh proposed that 
july 24 be set aside for a hearing on the classified information 
issue and that a trial begin as soon as practicable thereafter 
the prosecution didnt specify the nature of the change by the 
central intelligence agency other than to describe it as a new 
emphasis in the cias position 
fernandez and others under indictment in irancontra cases have 
requested declassification of large amounts of sensitive documents 
for use in their courtroom defenses intelligence agencies have been 
reluctant to declassify much of the information out of concern for 
national security 
as cia station chief in costa rica fernandez assisted former 
white house aide oliver l norths secret supply network aiding the 
contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebel 
force battling nicaraguas marxist government 
questioned by the cia inspector generals office and the tower 
commission in 1987 fernandez allegedly said he wasnt certain north 
was running the network and asserted that a secret airstrip 
construction project had been initiated by the costa rican 
government in fact the airstrip project was initiated by north 
fernandez and others to help supply the contras

commerce secretary robert mosbacher will decide 
soon whether to modify controversial regulations requiring shrimpers 
to equip their nets with turtleexcluder devices a spokesman said 
tuesday 
shrimpers claim the devices designed to keep endangered sea 
turtles from being tangled and killed in their nets also keep out a 
substantial portion of their catch because of clogging by debris and 
seaweed 
while opponents of the devices want mosbacher to continue 
suspending enforcement of the regulations until a study on the 
devices is completed by the national academy of sciences in 
february commerce spokesman brian gorman said that did not appear 
likely 
the coast guard last week ordered enforcement of the regulations 
be suspended pending mosbachers decision while the commerce 
department has its own enforcement force it relies on coast guard 
vessels for the atsea inspections 
there is not a whole lot that can be done in terms of a 
wholesale suspension of the regulations said gorman citing a 
federal court ruling upholding the law and a public comment period 
on the devices before their implementation 
gorman said the judge who upheld the law involving the devices 
us district court judge patrick carr of new orleans also agreed 
the regulations are not subject to the pending study 
mosbacher however has asked for a survey of the gulf coast to 
determine whether sargassum grass is a problem 
shrimpers claim an enormous infestation of this seaweed along 
the coast is clogging the nets and rendering the devices 
ineffective and causing a large loss of shrimp gorman said 
the survey he said began at the beginning of the month and an 
interim report is due within the next couple of days mosbacher will 
decide by weeks end or next week whether the regulations can be 
in some small way modified he said 
like the devices themselves the survey by the national marine 
fisheries service is controversial with rep solomon ortiz 
dtexas saying he is dissatisfied with the way the tests are being 
conducted 
ortiz said nets are being brought in after 20 minutes rather 
than being kept in the water for three or four hours as shrimpers 
would 
i dont think this is comparable to fishing conditions and of 
course theyre going to get different results ortiz said 
ortiz and other lawmakers said the devices reduce a shrimpers 
catch by 17 percent to 35 percent but with the recent seaweed 
infestation losses could reach 50 percent

lawsuit that president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii made an unconstitutional side agreement with congressional 
leaders on 498 million in humanitarian aid to the contras

procedures requiring consideration by the entire house and senate 
it was filed by us reps dan burton rind chuck douglas 
rnh philip crane rill and robert smith rnh 
burton and crane voted for the law providing the assistance while 
douglas and smith voted against it

inhibited in their performance of their constitutional duties they 
said in the lawsuit

contras nonmilitary aid 
the aid is intended to sustain the rebels until nicaragua holds 
elections early next year

the suspect in the attack abdel hadi suleiman rassem ghanem 23 
reportedly carried out the assault to avenge his friend who was 
shot in a clash with israeli troops and subsequently paralyzed 
the body of ms levine 39 will be flown to the united states on 
wednesday ms mekel said 
ms levine reportedly came to israel to learn hebrew and was 
hoping to open a dual law practice in philadelphia and in the jewish 
state 
she talked about a possibility of settling here the hospital 
spokeswoman said 
israeli leaders have blamed the palestine liberation organization 
for the attack and criticized the bush administration for being slow 
in defining the attack as terrorism 
joan levine speaking at a july 11 news conference that was 
arranged by the israeli foreign ministry said her sister had said 
from her hospital bed that the incident was a terrorist attack 
choking back sobs joan levine called her sister a champion of 
the homeless and the handicapped when she practiced law in the 
united states 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said in a statement to the 
associated press 
while we mourn ritas death and send our deepest condolences to 
her family we continue to hear repeatedly contemptuous declarations 
by the plo praising this horrible terrorist act the last of which 
was made by the official plo radio station in baghdad few days ago 
liel recalled how he visited rita levine in the hadassah 
hospitals intensive care unit 
she was impressive he said she was paralyzed had 
injuries all over but she was talking that she thought about 
coming to live here thought about opening an option

stonethrowers on the spot and were accepted as evidence by 
military courts 
israeli newspapers said the camera ambushes were being 
concealed near markets streets and intersections where 
stonethrowing attacks are especially frequent 
the daily maariv said in a recent incident in the west bank town 
of ramallah two suspected stonethrowers who denied their

interior secretary manuel lujan jr 
said tuesday that a proposed congressional moratorium on offshore 
oil drilling is asking americans to blindly reject even the 
possibilities before us 
democratic oregon gov neil goldschmidt said lujans remarks at 
the western governors conference were further evidence that 
president bushs administration is unresponsive to public concerns 
about restricting drilling in environmentally sensitive areas 
on the basis of what ive heard today there isnt much 
optimism of avoiding an environmental fight goldschmidt said 
complaining he had not found the administration responsive at 
all 
lujan said at a news conference later that his comments were not 
intended to signal the administrations intent to wage a major 
counterattack on the proposed oneyear moratorium resolution which 
has passed the house and is awaiting final action in the senate 
its not an allout fight but we will try to convince the 
senate that moratoria is not the way to go about it lujan said 
were not looking at drilling any of these offshore areas in the 
next year or two but we do need the opportunity to study the 
environmental problems that have to be faced to determine which 
areas we should not drill in and with the moratorium as it is now 
we cannot even do the environmental studies 
later the interior secretary told reporters that i dont mind 
a moratorium as far as drilling is concerned so long as it doesnt 
also ban research and environmental studies 
lujans tone in his formal address to the 17 governors was 
considerably less conciliatory with several direct attacks against 
congress which he said has displayed a cantdo attitude in its 
moratorium proposal and is not facing the nations vital need for 
energy independence from foreign sources 
by imposing moratoria the congress is saying that we should 
blindly reject even the possibilities before us lujan said 
certainly we must assess the risks we must realistically weigh 
the dangers we should never act recklessly but let us never be 
afraid to search for the facts and act wisely on them 
lujan also said the concern about oil spills is misdirected 
against offshore drilling operations which he said have spilled 
only minuscule amounts of oil since a 1969 accident in santa barbara 
while tankers continue to spill oil into our waters and 
offshore drilling continues to provide a record of environmentally 
sound production why are we attacking offshore drilling and 
letting the tankers nestle in their harbors lujan asked 
decreasing oil pollution in our waters can best be accomplished 
by decreasing the amount of oil transported by ship he said 
calling for an analysis of the feasibility of developing deepwater 
oil transfer facilities where oil would be transferred to shore 
from ships 
alaska gov steve cowper also raised oil spill questions in a 
presentation that sharply criticized the federal response to the 
alaskan oil spill the nations worst such accident with nearly 11 
million gallons of crude spilled in prince william sound 
the federal response to the oil spill was woefully deficient 
and we must do something about it cowper said 
we dont know how to clean up a major spill and if we did 
know how to clean it up would we have the capability to do it the 
answer is no cowper said asserting that current procedures lack 
either a clear chain of command or assurance that cleanup equipment 
will be available 
lujan replied that he agreed in general terms with cowpers 
criticisms the governors unanimously adopted a resolution drafted 
by cowper to revamp their oil spill response to among other things 
require that the coast guard maintain adequate emergency 
cleanup plans and assure resources to carry them out for all ports 
with oil spill risks 
provide guaranteed sources of money for immediate cleanup 
efforts 
guarantee the states rights to assess fees to support oil 
spill cleanup supervision 
assure states the legal authority to set liability and assess 
penalties and damage claims

a venezuelan judge tuesday charged 
economy minister and former business executive nestor rapanelli with 
misusing public funds in a multibilliondollar foreign exchange 
fraud 
rapanelli was sworn into office on saturday to succeed miguel 
roig who died suddenly after serving less than a week 
the allegation involved the overbilling of grain imports when 
rapanelli directed the caracas offices of the argentine grain 
conglomerate bunge and born between 1985 and 1986 
the purpose was to gain access to us dollars provided by the 
venezuelan government at preferential lower rates said a spokesman 
for caracas criminal court judge luis guillermo de la riva 
rapanelli said he is innocent my conscience is absolutely 
calm he told the government news agency telam 
rapanelli 60 said the charge initially was filed against him 
and executives of four other grain trading companies in the 
mid1980s and he was formally cleared in june 1988 
president carlos menem who took office on july 8 defended his 
minister 
its a lie and its going to end like all lies buried by the 
truth menem told reporters we are going to defend him 
totally 
judge la riva issued an order for rapanellis preventive 
detention the venezuelan government however did not request his 
extradition 
in the scandal a venezuelan government agency known as recadi 
over five years distributed 40 billion for subsidized imports 
recadi was created in early 1983 as venezuelas oil bonanza began 
to fade and exchange restrictions were imposed cheap dollars were 
lavishly granted via recadi to private and public companies for 
imports that otherwise would have fueled inflation 
but of the 40 billion distributed 6 billion is said to have 
been granted fraudulently mostly by overbilling personal 
connections or even outright bribery contributing to the depletion 
of the nations monetary reserves 
the scandal involved the executives of several multinational 
companies and nearly 50 arrest orders have been issued most 
businessmen and government figures involved fled the country many 
before the warrants were issued only a dozen arrests have been 
made mostly of lowlevel company employees 
no government figures have been detained although several travel 
prohibitions are pending against former finance ministers under the 
previous government of president jaime lusinchi 
la riva has been accused of taking bribes in exchange for 
juridical immunity for executives

texas education commissioner went too far in 
overturning the grade of a high school football player and declaring 
his team ineligible for the state championship trophy a judge ruled 
tuesday 
state district judge paul davis jr in austin said dallas 
carter high school can keep its 1988 trophy despite a challenge to 
the eligibility of running back gary edwards and education 
reformers fear the decision will undermine the states nopass 
noplay standard for student athletes 
last fall state investigators found that edwards had failed an 
algebra class which would have made the school ineligible for the 
high school football playoffs under texas nopass noplay law 
the principal at carter high in his own investigation found the 
teacher had miscalculated edwards grade and said he actually passed 
the principals finding was overturned by state education 
commissioner william kirby but the dallas school district got an 
injunction from davis allowing it to compete for the championship 
the judge said the commissioner should not have interfered unless 
the school abused its discretion in setting the grade 
this court finds that it was improper for the state 
commissioner of education to set the grade for an individual student 
in an individual class davis wrote 
the texas education agency will appeal davis ruling kirby said 
he believes the carter principal did abuse his discretion by 
altering the grade 
reformers say the ruling undermines efforts to set strict 
eligibility standards for school athletics 
it means that nopass noplay becomes nopass noproblem 
said lucius d bunton attorney for the university interscholastic 
league the states governing body for high school athletics 
the law which prohibits students who fail a class from 
participating in extracurricular activities is a key part of 
education reforms that texas lawmakers approved in 1984

a guerrilla organization seeking 
independence for namibia acknowledged tuesday that some of its 
members may have entered the territory but denied it was preparing a 
largescale incursion 
leaders of the southwest africa peoples organization told a 
news conference that louis pienaar administratorgeneral of 
namibia told foreign diplomats friday that 1900 armed swapo 
guerrillas were in angola near namibias northern border and 
appeared prepared to launch an incursion namibia also is known as 
southwest africa 
swapos international liaison officer theoben gurirab said 
small infiltrations by swapo members may be taking place 
it is possible that there could be individuals or very small 
groups of two or three in southern angola or northern namibia he 
said it is possible we are dealing with humans but all 
fighters have been instructed to return north of the 16th parallel 
in angola 
the dispute over possible guerrilla movements came as un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar arrived for three days of 
meetings to assess progress of the unsupervised independence plan 
in africas last colony ruled by south africa for 74 years 
today un resolution 435 is being implemented in earnest 
perez de cuellar said of the independence plan 
i want to ensure that there will conditions for the holding of 
free and fair elections he said in a brief statement upon arrival 
at the windhoek airport from lisbon portugal 
he said critical problems remain but did not elaborate 
perez de cuellar did not mention the allegations that swapo might 
be planning to invade namibia or gurirabs accusation that pienaar 
was creating war hysteria 
jacobus venter of namibias foreign affairs department said 
military intelligence indicated swapo guerrillas in groups ranging 
from 80 to 480 were massed in more than a dozen locations just 
north of the namibianangolan border 
in a letter friday to the top united nations official in namibia 
martti ahtisaari venter said the groups were armed wearing 
uniforms and had taken their rucksacks and equipment with them 
a copy of the letter also was sent to several foreign observer 
missions in namibia including the united states the soviet union 
france west germany and britain 
a joint swapoun delegation with angolan and tanzanian 
observers traveled to northern namibia on saturday to investigate 
the allegations un spokesman fred eckhard reported monday no 
evidence was found of infiltrations or largescale concentrations of 
swapo fighters 
pienaar also said in a statement issued monday that the 
situation was calm and under full control on both sides of the 
border 
gurirab denied there was an impending invasion and called the 
report an attempt by the administration to malign swapo 
as a result of this war hysteria several heads of state and 
government were awakened to be informed of an imminent crisis facing 
the namibian independence process he told the news conference 
under the un independence plan for namibia swapo guerrillas 
are allowed to return as unarmed refugees to take part in the 
november elections which swapo is favored to win after fighting a 
23year guerrilla war against south african forces 
however armed guerrillas are to remain at swapo bases north of 
the 16th parallel about 100 miles north of the namibian border 
namibias south african administration claims swapo guerrillas 
are south of that line but swapos statement said there is no 
swapo military presence south of the 16th parallel or in the 
northern part of this country

state department official about opening a dialogue on joint efforts 
to combat drug trafficking a congressman said tuesday 
the announcement by rep charles rangel dny chairman of the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control comes less 
than a week after cuban leader fidel castro criticized the united 
states for failing to warn him of cuban military involvement in 
cocaine trafficking and the execution of four cuban officers for 
that illegal activity 
rangel said he met tuesday with jose antonio arbesu fraga the 
new chief of the cuban interests section the cuban substitute for

arbesus assistant chief manuel davis 
the cubans told him they have talked with the state department 
and told them that cuba is waiting to see how havana can better 
establish a dialogue because no matter what the political 
differences are no one can allow the drug traffickers to take 
advantage rangel said 
they also told him they had told michael kozak deputy assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs that they are 
willing to cooperate in any international antidrug venture 
rangel said 
although the exact date of the meeting was not revealed a rangel 
aide noted that arbesu only became chief of the cuban interests 
section in june 
a state department official said tuesday evening mr kozaks 
met with cuban representatives many times over the years and that 
kozak has met arbesu this official declined to confirm or deny that 
the specific meeting in question had taken place or what might have 
been discussed 
we have raised narcotics with the cubans on many many 
occasions over the years said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
however he refused to say whether the state department had 
discussed cooperative antidrug efforts with the cubans or simply 
criticized them for involvement in drug trafficking accusations 
that have been leveled repeatedly by the united states 
we certainly think theres ample room for the cubans to take 
action he said were looking for deeds rather than just 
words 
when the united states says it is looking for deeds its talking 
about interdicting drugs stopping the flow over their 
territory he added 
he declined to comment on the recent execution of four cuban 
military officers for drug trafficking 
people who answered the phone at the cuban interests section late 
tuesday afternoon said arbesu and davis were both gone for the day 
and no one else was available to speak on the matter 
last week castro told the cuban council of state in a fourhour 
speech we need some way to communicate in this common battle we 
need to talk to the americans about how to manage this situation 
the cuban leader also rebuked the united states saying it had 
at least two names of military officers involved in a 
cocainetrafficking conspiracy long before contacts in colombia 
alerted cuban officials 
a hero of the cuban revolution who was a trusted advisor to 
castro army maj gen arnaldo ochoa sanchez and three other 
military officers were executed last thursday for smuggling tons of 
drugs into the united states 
the drug scandal stunned and embarrassed castro and his communist 
government which for years denied us accusations that cuba was 
being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana 
last december rangel led a congressional delegation to cuba and 
met with castro for five hours 
before he left state department and drug enforcement 
administration officials told rangel that there was no official or 
unofficial cooperation with cuba on drugs although there had been 
communications on other topics a rangel aide said 
meanwhile the coast guard abruptly canceled a closed briefing of 
rangels committee regarding uscuban drug cooperation that had 
been scheduled for early tuesday morning the congressman said 
rangel said coast guard commandant adm paul yost called him late 
monday to cancel the meeting saying changing developments were 
responsible 
if there are new developments why cant they be told to the 
congress rangel asked 
i can only conclude until i am informed otherwise that 
administration anticommunist zealots stopped this briefing which 
could have shown the congress how the united states and cuba can 
work together to stop the common enemy of drugs he said

a replica of a civil warera sailing ship 
became trapped in ice in the north atlantic and later sank in rough 
seas but the seven crew members were rescued the ships builder 
said 
the sheila yeates a topsail ketch with an oak frame and a 
50foot deck left duluth on may 15 through the great lakes and st 
lawrence seaway bound for cornwall england 
it was one of the tall ships that commemorated the us 
bicentennial and had made numerous other voyages since then 
including one in 1985 from duluth to greenland but this was to have 
been its first atlantic crossing 
geoffrey pope 76 of excelsior who built and skippered the 
ship gave an account of the ships last voyage and sinking to 
friends in the minneapolis area monday from aboard the danish shrimp 
boat kiviuq which plowed through ice and dense fog friday to save 
the crew 
i feel very responsible pope said i lost the ship but 
aside from that i feel such a reaffirmation of the potential of 
the bond that exists between men in extremus 
pope said the voyage went smoothly until thursday at a point 
about 80 miles south of greenlands point farwell when they 
encountered ice farther south than expected 
the ship was soon engulfed in thick fog and surrounded by massive 
chunks of ice with no room to maneuver the shifting ice would have 
crushed the wooden ship pope said 
a lifeboat wouldnt have survived for two seconds he said 
it was kind of a mental hell there was no escape this was the 
end 
early friday the crew awakened pope and urged him to radio a 
mayday appeal for help 
the kiviuq which fishes in the arctic and is equipped with 
icebreaking equipment responded and found the sheila yeates within 
hours 
the trawler freed the sailing vessel and towed it 430 miles 
pope said he thought the ship could be repaired within a month 
but that was before rough water made the ship take on water it was 
finally cut loose and sank monday he told fellow sailing enthusiast 
tim carlson of plymouth 
the sheila yeates was designed by robert jackson of hopkins and 
was built in lunenburg nova scotia it was launched a month before 
opsail the july 1976 sailing extravaganza in new york harbor 
more than a dozen investors sank 150000 into the vessel just to 
get it launched six times their original estimates it was insured 
for 150000 by lloyds of london less than onethird what it would 
cost to replace it according to pope

angola was expected to become the 152nd member 
of the international monetary fund despite an announcement by the 
state department on tuesday that the united states voted against it 
the us has made clear that it could not support angolan 
membership in the fund at this time and we voted against the 
membership resolution the state department said 
the united states has strong influence in the fund but less than 
19 percent of the voting power international monetary sources who 
spoke on condition they not be quoted said none of the other 
members has indicated that it would vote against the southwest 
african country 
one source said the united states was apparently willing to let 
itself be outvoted and that a strong us position against angola 
could have delayed consideration 
a spokesman for the fund said he could make no statement now 
that an announcement would come in about a week the last votes are 
due by telex wednesday at the funds headquarters in washington 
approval of angolas membership in the fund would normally clear 
the way for it also to become the 152nd member of the funds sister 
organization the world bank 
us administrations have opposed fund membership for angola 
because of its marxist government and supported the rebel unita 
movement of jonas savimbi on june 22 savimbi and the government of 
president jose eduardo dos santos agreed on a ceasefire 
the funds basic job is to keep currencies stable to do that it 
makes loans in recent years largely to third world countries 
the borrowing governments promise in return to make belttightening 
changes in policy so as to put their economies into better shape to 
repay 
some of these changes have resulted in hardships for their 
people devaluation of a borrowing countrys currency which the 
fund often calls for makes imported goods more expensive cuts in 
government spending another frequent requirement often result in 
cuts of subsidies on food and other basic articles and consequently 
high prices for consumers 
riots earlier this year in venezuela and jordan were linked to 
policies undertaken at the funds suggestion 
fund officials say that unless borrowing governments adopt such 
policies their overall situation will grow even worse 
increasingly the world bank has made similar structural 
adjustment loans but the bulk of its lending is for specific 
projects such as schools roads farming and health care which 
contribute directly to raising a countrys standard of living

president bush said tuesday he was offended by 
republican advisers who portrayed dan quayle as a campaign disaster 
who had to be protected from his own political ineptitude 
in a new book by jules witcover and jack germond several 
consultants to last years bushquayle election campaign depict the 
vice presidential candidate as a lightweight who was not ready for 
the national political scene 
one of the handlers employed by the bush team to manage 
quayles campaign travels joseph canzeri said the former indiana 
senator was tough to work with because he had a limited attention 
span the impatience of youth 
hes a fairly quick study but about what he wants to hear 
canzeri was quoted as saying in the book whose broad stripes and 
bright stars the trivial pursuit of the presidency 1988 
if he doesnt like it he goes away from it he was like a 
kid ask him to turn off a light and by the time he gets to the 
switch hes forgotten what he went for 
canzeri said the handlers knew we were going to have to script 
him 
the book also indicates that james lake the former reagan 
campaign press secretary who advised quayle was dismayed at some of 
quayles remarks on television as controversy about his vietnamera 
national guard service heightened 
at one point when the campaign wanted quayle to refrain from 
answering questions so as not to overshadow bushs convention 
acceptance speech lake said quayle wanted to answer those 
questions i just pushed him aside 
bush asked about the comments of canzeri and other former 
campaign operatives said tuesday that he found them personally 
offensive 
thats the ugly side of politics he said 
he told reporters flying home from the netherlands with him 
aboard air force one that quayle has been an effective vice 
president 
quayle traveling in california said tuesday he found it 
rather a cruel hoax that some of your top advisers would speak 
like that behind your back its most unfortunate that probably 
explains a lot of the problems we had on the campaign but thats 
behind us 
quayle made his comments during an impromptu news conference at 
san diegos miramar naval air station 
he told reporters in los angeles on monday that it was a 
critical mistake to rely on the advice of his handlers if i 
had it to do over again id do it differently i would have been a 
lot more accessible to the press from the outset i wouldnt have 
allowed myself to be in that controlled situation i share the 
blame i could have told them to go to hell but i didnt press 
secretary david beckwith quoted his boss as saying 
bush cited the vice presidents two diplomatic trips to latin 
america for the new administration as examples of his merit along 
with his chairmanship of the national space council and his 
contributions to bushs morning briefings 
hes a good man and he deserves something better than a 
postmortem kick in the ankles the president said 
my judgment has been vindicated he is serious he is doing a 
first class job bush said 
the germondwitcover book which concerns the entire presidential 
campaign not just quayles part deals with quayle as a candidate 
rather than as vice president 
political pros quoted as belittling his abilities included stuart 
spencer former adviser to republican presidential candidates and a 
californiabased political consultant 
canzeri asked spencer why he let a rebellious quayle scrap his 
text and deliver his own rambling speech on defense at one chicago 
appearance 
spencer used an obscene metaphor to state that he wanted quayle 
to foul up in public and then well own him again 
after his debate with democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen quayle was widely criticized for comparing himself to 
the late president kennedy as a young man who won national office 
canzeri quoted quayle adviser mitch daniels a former white house 
political director as moaning we told him not to get into that 
daniels in a telephone interview tuesday acknowledged campaign 
advisers had agreed it would be inadvisable to bring up such a 
comparison 
but daniels who was on the road full time with quayle said he 
did not agree with the tenor of criticisms from those quoted in the 
book saying their view of this is 180 degrees wrong 
gop consultant ed rollins also a former white house political 
director is quoted in the book as saying that had the bush forces 
received an honest reading from gop senators on quayle as a possible 
vice presidential candidate they would have been told he was a 
lightweight 
rollins was quoted as saying the campaign would have heard the 
same from any group of political reporters or any group of 
political people in this town 
beckwith said in his boss defense that quayle has built a 
reputation in washington as a serious respected effective vice 
president he said the word is a little slower getting out to 
the general public around the country

vice president dan quayle said tuesday the 
united states should commit itself to exploring and developing space 
and that congress should fully fund construction of a manned space 
station 
the president and i are committed to american leadership in 
exploration understanding economic use and yes eventual 
settlement in space he said in an address to 4000 employees of 
general dynamics space systems division 
we americans have been pushing back frontiers throughout 
history today space is americas frontier said quayle 
appointed chairman of the national space council by president bush 
quayle likened the first manned apollo landing on the moon in 
1969 to columbus discovery of the new world 
the time is now at hand for americans to be preparing for the 
equivalent of 1620 the year pilgrims landed on the shore of 
plymouth bay and settled the new world quayle said 
he addressed the employees after touring the plant where general 
dynamics is building titan centaur rockets for use as launch 
vehicles 
quayle said the expense of establishing colonies on the moon and 
mars would be returned many times over in the development of new 
industry and jobs and the expansion of knowledge 
space is a highyield investment he said and also urged 
congress to approve full funding for the national aeronautic and 
space administrations proposal to build a space station 
quayle said president bush would go into more specifics about the 
administrations space policy thursday when bush delivers an 
address to mark the 20th anniversary of americas first manned lunar 
landing 
we cannot afford not to go forward in space quayle said 
unfortunately in the past couple of decades weve had somewhat of 
a status quo approach to space weve got to do better than that 
during his stay in san diego quayle also visited qualcomm a 
hightechnology firm in sorrento valley and met with business 
leaders and officials from the university of california at san diego 
at qualcomm he used a satellite communications system to send 
greetings to 4500 truckers nationwide whose rigs are equipped with 
omnitracs messaging and position reporting computers 
congratulations on your use of high technology to enhance the 
competitive position of the industry quayle told the truckers

he came he saw he spent and spent and 
spent cosmetics heir ronald lauder has already dished out a record 
85 million in his mayoral bid but the profits from makeup havent 
covered his campaign woes 
hes got something none of the other candidates will ever have 
a very very very wealthy mother political adviser roger ailes 
a former lauder campaign worker observed early in the candidates 
campaign 
lauders mother is estee lauder head of the cosmetics empire 
that bears her name 
months later that remains lauders one big advantage 
in a year where the mayoral race is wide open almost no one 
gives lauder a chance recent polls show former us attorney 
rudolph giuliani crushing lauder in the republican primary the 
projections in the november general election in which lauder will 
be on the conservative party line are even uglier 
sure thing ron lauder will lose by a margin so large he wont 
be tempted to demand a recount predicted daily news columnist 
bill reel 
lauder and giuliani are vying for the chance to unseat democratic 
mayor edward i koch so are democrats manhattan borough president 
david dinkins city comptroller harrison j goldin and former 
metropolitan transportation authority chairman richard ravitch 
yet lauder 44 continues undaunted airing more and more 
commercials determined to continue his conservative 
prodeathpenalty campaign 
giuliani has ripped lauder as an incompetent who never worked 
for a living lauder has responded by calling giuliani a liberal 
in tv commercials 
lauder has spent 85 for each of the 100000 or so republicans 
expected to vote in the sept 12 primary double the total of five 
other mayoral contenders combined 
this is my money i earned it honestly and i owe no one 
lauder said after mondays revelation about his campaign spending 
there wont be any favors to be called in with the lauder 
administration 
but a lauder administration would have to overcome these bumps on 
the campaign trail 
on a radio appearance lauder couldnt say how many members the 
city council has it has 35 
his agenda for change included firing the schools chancellor 
the mayor has no power to do this 
asked why lauder said the incumbent hadnt done much for the 
past couple of years the incumbent had been in office for one year 
a recent news conference in the south bronx was quickly changed 
to a factfinding tour when only one reporter showed up lauder 
entertained his audience of one by incorrectly identifying the 
surrounding neighborhood

william lucas nominated to be the bush 
administrations civil rights chief gave inaccurate answers on a 
sworn application to be admitted to the new york bar the justice 
department acknowledged tuesday 
the admission came to light as lucas was administered a sharp 
snub by his home states two senators who said they would not 
introduce him to the senate judiciary committee at the opening of 
hearings wednesday on his nomination to be assistant attorney 
general for civil rights 
justice department spokesman deborah burstionwade confirmed that 
the black republican from michigan failed to state on the new york 
form in 1981 that he had once failed the district of columbia bar 
exam his application to new york was successful 
lucas 61 simply stated that he was admitted to the michigan bar 
in 1971 when asked if he had ever taken another state bar 
examination or applied to practice in another state 
lucas also answered in the negative when he was asked if he had 
ever been a witness in a civil or criminal court proceeding when in 
fact he had testified numerous times ms burstionwade confirmed 
ms burstionwade acknowledged inaccuracies on the new york state 
bar application but said i dont see that they negaate four 
decades of public service 
there is no intention here to mislead she said adding that 
she was not trying belittle or make light of the 
inaccuracies 
there is no concern about his honesty or his ethics ms 
burstionwade said the mans background is just too admirable 
but she acknowledged that attorney general dick thornburgh and 
his top aides were not aware of lucas inaccurate answers until last 
week 
the new york bar application could become an issue in conjunction 
with the fact that lucas stated on resumes and in court testimony 
that he had been a justice department attorney in 1963 when in fact 
he was a legal assistant not a lawyer 
lucas was forced to leave the department when he failed the dc 
bar examination he joined the fbi later becoming sheriff of wayne 
county michigan which includes detroit and after that county 
executive 
in signing the new york form lucas swore to the accuracy and 
truth of his answers his signature was witnessed by a notary public 
earlier in the day ms burstionwade had said lucas had given a 
truthful answer to the question about whether he had ever been a 
court witness saying the application was filed in his personal 
capacity as an attorney in that capacity he was never a witness 
confronted with more details about the form ms burstionwade 
acknowledged the inaccuracies and said she had not seen the form 
when she gave her initial response 
lucas nomination is opposed by a number of civil rights 
organizations who say he lacks the professional legal experience to 
head the justice departments civil rights division 
michigans two democratic senators carl levin and donald w 
riegle jr broke the senates usual practice by declining to 
introduce lucas to the senate judiciary committee 
nominees most often receive the courtesy of an introduction from 
homestate senators at confirmation hearings regardless of party 
differences and sometimes even the intention to oppose the nominee 
levin said in a statement he wanted to consider the judiciary 
committee proceedings as part of my decision on the lucas nomination 
because an introduction of a nominee generally implies that one has 
already decided to recommend the nominee 
riegle also sent word he would not introduce lucas saying 
through a spokeswoman that he had concerns about the nominees 
qualifications 
it would have been desirable for them to have come but i 
wouldnt read to much into it said david runkel an assistant to 
attorney general dick thornburgh 
civil rights groups including the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the leadership conference on civil 
rights have been opposed to lucas a onetime democrat who lost a 
republican race for governor of michigan in 1986 
lucas was to be followed as a witness by former circuit judge 
victor baum who in 1976 sat on a panel that held lucas in contempt 
of court for failing to ease crowding in the wayne county jail when 
he was sheriff 
that panel found culpability on the part of lucas for his 
deliberate and unilateral election to disobey the judgement and 
orders of the circuit court the judges imposed 250 fines for 
each of several violations after finding lucas had ignored a 1972 
order to improve jail conditions 
critics also have been focusing on a us circuit court of 
appeals finding in 1985 that lucas failed to investigate police 
brutality charges in the 1976 beating of a jail prisoner named 
salvatore marchese 
the panel said this served to confirm the existence of an 
unstated policy of toleration of illegal brutality 
i think that what it demonstrates is that lucas is the wrong 
person for this job by any measure said arthur kropp president 
of of people for the american way a group that is fighting the 
nomination 
lucas would succeed william bradford reynolds whose tenure was 
marked by constant friction with civil rights groups

the senate on tuesday brushed aside complaints 
that president bush is packing the ranks of the nations envoys with 
unqualified political cronies and defeated a bid to restrict 
political appointments to 15 percent of the diplomatic corps 
the vote rejecting an amendment by sen al gore dtenn was 
7920 
gore said he would try again wednesday and offered an amendment 
to hold to 30 percent the number of ambassadors and senior state 
department officials nominated for their political contributions 
gore said the higher percentage was more in keeping with the 
average of political appointments in recent administrations 
he said he also will seek to rally opposition against nominees 
whose nonpolitical qualifications to represent the united states 
abroad are thin 
arguing for the more restrictive 15 percent level gore and other 
democrats said twothirds of the 42 ambassadorial nominations 
submitted by bush can be classified as political 
but sen jesse helms rnc and other senators contended that 
the proposed restriction would represent an unwarranted and 
unconstitutional intrusion on the presidents ability to conduct 
foreign policy 
gore said the political appointments undermine the us foreign 
service damage its morale and represent an abuse for which there 
is no justification 
sen paul sarbanes dmd said the 14 career foreign service 
officers nominated as ambassadors by bush represent by far the 
lowest level in any of the last six presidential administrations 
in general career diplomats received 60 percent or more of 
ambassadorships sarbanes said 
this is a marked radical change sarbanes said this is a 
vast departure from a pattern followed by previous administrations 
republican and democratic alike 
it is a departure so outrageous sarbanes said that 
something has to be done about it 
but sen jesse helms rnc the ranking republican member of 
the senate foreign relations committee said the right of the 
president to nominate whoever he chooses as ambassador should not 
be prohibited by law 
we are intruding on the foreign policy authority of the 
president helms said 
but gore disagreed 
this practice has reached the point where the foreign service 
is curtailing prematurely the careers of increasing numbers of its 
finest diplomats gore said 
weve created a game of musical chairs in which the 
professionals the core of expertise and continuity modern 
diplomatic life demands lose out he said 
the 20 senators voting for the amendment to restrict political 
appointees were john b breaux dla dale bumpers dark quentin

fbi director william s sessions on tuesday 
filled the bureaus longvacant no 2 position by promoting 
executive assistant director floyd i clarke to be his deputy 
director 
clarkes promotion caps a meteoric rise in the ranks of the fbis 
high command clarke 47 was named an executive assistant director 
in february making him equal in rank to oliver b revell once 
mentioned as a possible director of the bureau and john e otto 
in announcing a realignment of the top fbi executive positions 
sessions said that otto would become associate deputy director for 
administration and revell associate deputy director for 
investigations 
the realignment was made to meet increasingly complex 
responsibilities and the need to meet future challenges sessions 
said in a statement 
sessions said that as deputy director clarke has the authority 
to resolve management issues across divisional lines and will chair 
the bureaus senior executive service selection board 
clarke otto and revell will continue to be part of the 
directors advisory board on strategy policy and planning sessions 
said 
revell 50 was criticized by some members of congress for his 
defense of the fbis controversial surveillance of the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador cispes in the early 
1980s 
revells defense of the operation came several months before 
sessions acknowledged on capitol hill last year that the bureau had 
overstepped its bounds by gathering intelligence on domestic 
political organizations 
six fbi officials were disciplined as a result of the cispes 
investigation no action was taken against revell 
revell will continue to oversee criminal investigations foreign 
counterintelligence and counterterrorism programs as well as the fbi 
laboratory 
clarke who had been a protege of revell was named deputy 
assistant director of the criminal investigative division in 1982 
and became assistant director for criminal investigations in 1985 
previously he had headed the fbis philadelphia field office and 
had served as an administrative assistant to the attorney general 
during the ford administration 
the no 2 position officially known as the associate director 
has been vacant since the early 1980s with the retirement of james 
b adams

the network said the president endorsed bakers call on israel to 
give up any idea of annexation of the west bank of the jordan river 
occupied by israeli troops since 1967 to stop new settlements in 
that territory and to reopen palestinian schools 
at the white house spokesman robert hall declined to say 
anything about a letter from the president but added that all 
sounds like us policy

reiterated us opposition to creating a palestinian state support 
for secure israeli borders an undivided jerusalem and assurance 
that israels military advantage over its arab enemies would be kept 
he added it was designed at the suggestion of 11 leaders in the 
us senate to help shamir resist opposition within his own likud 
party against the plan for an election in the disputed area of 
representatives who would then negotiate with the israeli government 
shamir then made a speech adopting conditions urged by other 
likud leaders continued jewish settlements in the area and a ban on 
participation in the election by palestinians living in jerusalem 
the conditions brought a threat from the israeli labor party to 
pull out of israels coalition government

die squad says it will kill two japanese each month because their 
nation collaborates with chinas government the japanese embassy 
said tuesday 
a letter in chinese mailed to the japan airlines office in 
beijing also said citizens of other countries would be killed if 
they collaborated with the regime 
police continued rounding up participants in prodemocracy 
protests that ended with the army crackdown june 34 reports 
tuesday said journalist dai qing and yang wei a recently freed 
dissident linked to a chinese group in new york were arrested

democracy movement among intellectuals last fall after students 
took to the streets in april demanding reforms she signed several 
petitions to the government 
her husband reached by telephone said plainclothes police 
arrived at their home during dinner thursday and led her away he 
said he had not heard from her since 
it was the first known arrest of a journalist involved in the 
protests hundreds of journalists marched and signed petitions for 
press freedom and are said to be required now to write 
selfcriticisms 
xinhua the official news agency said shanghai police arrested 
yang on tuesday for allegedly conducting demagogical propaganda 
for counterrevolutionary ends yang 33 was jailed from 1987 
until january on similar charges 
while studying in the united states in 1985 he wrote articles 
for a journal published by the china alliance for democracy an 
expatriate group seeking political reform 
more than 2060 arrests were reported in china in the first weeks 
after the june 34 crackdown official reports of arrests have been 
rare recently but unofficial ones from families and friends 
continue 
chinese sources say arrests have exceeded 2000 in beijing alone 
the chinese government said 200300 people were killed in the 
military attack on protesters in june but western diplomats and 
chinese sources said the death toll may have reached 3000 
a local official of japan airlines said the company had not 
decided whether to take special security precautions because of the 
letter received monday 
it said because the japanese pirates collude with the 
communist party dictatorial government and plot to launch a 
largescale economic invasion of china from today we the 
bloodbright dare to die squad enter into a state of war with the 
japanese pirates 
two japanese businessmen tourists or people considered friends

would increase next year to one a week if japan did not repent 
please tell other countries if they collude with the 
dictatorial government they will meet the same fate the letter 
concluded 
we dont know how serious this is said hideo watanabe first 
secretary of the japanese embassy 
the letters tone and terminology suggested links to the student 
movement students and supporters in many cities formed dare to 
die squads during the prodemocracy campaign and there has been 
speculation some would go underground 
when dynamite exploded on a shanghaibound train june 26 killing 
24 people authorities said they suspected sabotage results of a 
police investigation have not been released but the government 
later issued emergency orders for tighter security to stop the 
enemy from blowing up and sabotaging railway facilities 
china has no known terrorist organizations acts of sabotage are 
reported from time to time but usually are attributed to 
disgruntled individuals 
official controls and supervision extend to many aspects of daily 
life making it difficult for an underground organization to operate 
watanabe said about 1000 japanese are in beijing roughly half 
the number living in the capital before political turmoil caused 
many foreigners to leave 
some japanese businessmen have returned but express reservations 
about future investment their government has halted highlevel 
contacts with china and frozen development aid 
in the only other known case of a terrorist threat to foreigners 
authorities told the us embassy in june 1988 that nationals of a 
third country planned to attack americans in beijing

public explanation the third country was not identified

special care to ensure the safety of japanese people in china a 
ministry official in tokyo said 
in another development in tokyo the foreign ministry told a 
chinese envoy that although japan joined six other industrialized 
democracies at last weeks summit in paris in criticizing the 
government crackdown it hopes to resume cooperative relations with 
china 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said tadashi ikeda a foreign 
ministry official met with tang jiaxuan chinas charge daffaires 
in tokyo 
the spokesman said ikeda told tang that japan cannot accept the 
use of military force against citizens in china from the 
humanitarian point of view therefore our relations with china are 
naturally restrained 
but taizo watanabe said japan does not want china to be isolated 
and that ikeda told the envoy we will be ready to resume 
cooperative relations when chinas response and international public 
opinion have improved 
tang echoed the chinese governments denunciation of the 
communique issued at the paris summit according to taizo watanabe 
he said tang told ikeda the criticism was a violent intervention 
in domestic politics which ignores the facts 
tang also said the chinese policy of developing friendly 
relations with foreign countries and its economic reforms remain 
unchanged the spokesman said

gov henry bellmon modified his dayold 
school funding program that would all but abolish personal property 
tax tuesday surrendering a plan to give a tax break on groceries 
bellmon proposed monday to base school funding on a 15 percent 
income tax surcharge on corporate and personal incomes and a new 2 
percent school tax on goods and services 
the governor said he made the proposal because the current 
property tax is costly to administer and is not applied equally in 
many counties 
bellmons plan also called for eliminating the sales tax on 
groceries but the governors office issued a statement tuesday 
saying the proposed exemption was being dropped because of 
legislative objections 
bellmon also announced that the proposed new 2 percent gross 
receipts tax earmarked for schools was being reduced to 19 percent 
the plan has been called revolutionary by education secretary 
sandy garrett because it eliminates local property taxes as a major 
revenue source for funding schools a drastically reduced property 
tax would remain to retire any bonded indebtedness 
the grocery tax exemption had been hailed by some as a selling 
point for the program but bellmon said it drew objections during a 
briefing session with legislators 
he said the lawmakers were worried that some small cities which 
charge local sales taxes could not survive the revenue loss from 
exempting grocery sales 
oklahomans now pay a 4 percent state sales tax on grocery 
purchases in addition to municipal sales taxes bellmon said 
grocery sales would be exempt under the new school gross receipts 
tax 
bellmons package also had included a 2 percent gross receipts 
tax for cities but he said that plan also will not be needed since 
the grocery sales exemption was being deleted 
he said the new program would provide an extra 245 million in 
revenue beginning in 1991 which amounts to an 8 percent increase 
in the state budget 
he has called the legislature to a special session beginning aug 
14 to consider the plan 
he said when it is fully implemented oklahoma will be among the 
leaders in educational excellence 
under the bellmon plan the new school tax would redistributed to 
counties on a perpupil basis the 847 million now going to schools 
from the states general fund would continue to be distributed 
officials say 
state rep carolyn thompson chairman of the house education 
committee said legislators were trying to get some accurate 
numbers to better analyze the program 
theres no question it is a bold attempt to restructure our tax 
policies and at this point it needs detailed analysis before public 
policy decisions are made she said

defendant in the case paid him a lot of money for military 
secrets 
the tape was played on the second day of huseyin yildirims trial 
on charges he conspired to sell us defense documents to the 
soviets and east germans yildirim 61 is from turkey and lives in 
belleair beach fla 
on the tape army warrant officer james w hall iii is seen 
telling an fbi agent who posed as a soviet agent named vladimir 
that yildirim was his only contact in the scheme 
the money had increased it was substantial hall told the 
agent during a meeting near savannah late last year he was paying 
me a lot of money what i wanted to be able to do was to afford some 
of the things i wanted i didnt flaunt the money 
on the tape vladimir counted out 60000 in bundles of 
5000 each to hall at the end of an almost twohour meeting 
now listen please be careful with this when you get home 
vladimir told hall on the tape 
hall 30 is expected to testify later in the trial he was 
sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined 50000 after pleading 
guilty during a march courtmartial to charges of espionage 
attempted espionage and failure to obey army regulations

and soviet agents between 1983 and 1988 when hall was stationed in 
west germany and new jersey yildirim worked as a civilian mechanic 
at an armyrun auto shop in west berlin while hall was there 
the trial is being held in savannah because hall was stationed at 
nearby fort stewart when he was arrested last december 
two defense department experts are at the trial to ensure that no 
classified material is discussed the videotape shown tuesday was 
edited to remove references to classified information prosecutors 
said 
on the recording hall complained that his spy activity decreased 
after he was transferred from germany to new jersey 
in new jersey i was very busy he said i was with my wife 
and children the people i worked with were counterintelligence 
people they were very suspicious by their nature

sergeant to warrant officer was living a lifestyle his salary of 
20200 could not support 
hall admitted to army officials that he received more than 
100000 between 1983 and 1988 for classified documents

a woman who was a central figure in 
floridas righttodie debate has died of natural causes before the 
issue could be settled but a relative says she will continue the 
legal fight 
estelle m browning died sunday at the sunset point nursing 
center in clearwater where she had stayed since a debilitating 
stroke 2 years ago she was 89 
mrs browning drafted a living will before she suffered the 
stroke asking not to be kept alive by artificial means if her death 
appeared to be imminent 
doris herbert 80 mrs brownings legal guardian second cousin 
and only living relative said she will continue the legal battle to 
uphold such a will because it might help someone else 
im sorry that things turned out the way they did that she had 
to suffer for 2 years said ms herbert i wanted more than 
anything for her to live but i also wanted her wishes carried 
out 
the case is destined for the florida supreme court and may 
clarify whether people have the right to refuse extraordinary 
medical procedures that will prolong their lives 
in september 1988 ms herbert asked that intravenous tubes 
giving mrs browning nourishment be removed from her arm to carry 
out her wishes 
but a pinellas circuit judge refused in april to allow the tube 
to be removed 
the pinellas county state attorneys office said the case 
involved more than mrs brownings living will it constitutes 
genocide of the elderly says prosecutor c marine king 
in march the 2nd district court of appeal ruled unanimously that 
ms herbert as mrs brownings legal guardian had the right to 
order the feeding tubes be withdrawn 
the pinellaspasco state attorneys office appealed the ruling to 
the florida supreme court where it is pending the appellate court 
ruled that mrs brownings constitutional right of privacy extended 
to refusing such treatment but asked the states high court to 
consider the case as a matter of great public importance 
as a church volunteer mrs browning used to visit nursing homes 
where she saw patients hooked to lifesupport machines she signed a 
living will in november 1985 asking that her death not be prolonged 
artificially i can go in peace when my time comes she told 
witnesses john and rose king 
ms herbert moved to dunedin from albany ny to live with mrs 
browning in 1982 four years after mrs brownings husband frank 
died the two were like sisters throughout their lives said 
george felos ms herberts lawyer 
it is hoped that the florida supreme court removes the 
government from the patients deathbed and leaves decisions in 
these matters to be made by the patient and the patients family 
felos said 
state law allows patients to refuse food and water only if they 
are competent and are terminally ill doctors testified that mrs 
browning was never terminally ill although they said she couldnt 
speak and had difficulty moving and that removing the feeding tubes 
would end her life 
earlier this month gov bob martinez vetoed a bill that would 
have allowed people with living wills to refuse to be put on 
lifesupport machines and feeding tubes so long as doctors agreed 
they were ineffective he said the legislature had prematurely 
decided a controversial question without guidance from the state 
supreme court

president bush has before him a recommendation 
to call for a permanent human outpost on the moon to be used to 
launch a manned mission to mars it was learned tuesday night 
the recommendation is contained in the draft of a major speech 
the president is to give on thursday the 20th anniversary of the 
day neil armstong took his giant leap for mankind on the moon 
during the apollo 11 mission 
bush said tuesday that he had not decided what he would say on 
thursday 
but if he accepts the speech before him he will call for study 
to begin on a multibillion dollar project that would entail 
building a permanent manned moon station and launching the first 
manned flight to mars from it said a knowledgeable administration 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush also is expected to make a push for renewed funds for the 
earthorbiting space station which is suffering congressional cuts 
to the budget bush proposed for it 
one option that had been considered a joint space mission with 
the soviets is not in the recommendations bush is reviewing the 
official said 
neither cost estimates nor a timetable was contained in the 
moonmars proposal as drafted but the venture would cost hundreds 
of billions of dollars over decades 
the source described vice president dan quayle who chairs bushs 
advisory national space council as the driving force behind the 
proposal put together with the help of the council staff 
the vice president has been briefing members of congress and 
industry leaders on what such a project might entail the official 
said 
in california where he is making a series of speeches quayle 
did not divulge what bush might say thursday but he fanned the 
speculation by saying the bush administration is moving forward to 
put the pieces in place for another great leap forward in space 
he said the nation must begin to think about the voyage of a 
new mayflower about expanding the human presence into the solar 
system as a longterm goal 
the only specifics he mentioned regarding white house plans for 
space were three projects already announced asking congress to 
support space station freedom a new earth observation satellite and 
the national aerospace plane 
quayles goal and that of other boosters of rejuvenation of the 
space program is to give the space program a mission again so it 
gets the funding it deserves the official said 
space boosters have been calling for the president to make a bold 
proposal akin to president john f kennedys 1961 pledge to put a 
man on the moon by the end of the 1960s a pledge that armstrong 
kept on july 20 1969 
other sources said white house officials preparing bushs 
thursday message on space asked for extensive briefings on plan 
drafted by the national aeronautics and space administration called 
mission to planet earth a proposal for an intense environmental 
study of the planet from space 
the planet earth project calls for an intensive study of the 
earth and its environment using data gathered by sophisticated 
satellites and by scientists and instruments orbiting aboard the 
space shuttle 
there was talk that by supporting the mission to planet earth 
the president could help his image as the environmental president 
a nasa source said 
bush returning from europe aboard air force one was asked 
tuesday about his space speech but gave no indication about what 
his plans were 
the president said he did not know if his announcement would be 
a big space announcement or simply an event commemorating 
those apollo years 
bush added im not ready to say whether were going to have a 
new space initiative i want to be sure that what i propose passes 
any test of fiscal sanity fiscal reasonableness

video screen information on altitude speed and direction for up to 
16 minutes

information but were not going to put more aircraft in the sky 
than can be safely handled at any given time

network news will enter the questionable world 
of recreations this coming season on cbs and nbc 
the cast and producer of nbcs new yesterday today and 
tomorrow as well as the news divisions president argued before 
a meeting of television critics that theres nothing wrong with tv 
news recreating news events though such dramatizations have 
heretofore been the bailiwick of infotainment shows like 
americas most wanted and a current affair on fox and nbcs 
unsolved mysteries 
its just another way of telling a story the same way 
newspapers use graphics they use other ways to reconstruct said 
nbc news president michael gartner 
when we do recreations we will do them i assure you 
responsibly clearly labeled and very cautiously said mary alice 
williams one of the three cohosts of the new show 
we will only use them when there is no other way to convey the 
story when there is no other archival footage for this we might 
compare it to as you know in a federal court you still cant bring 
cameras in and so we have courtroom sketch artists 
cbs west 57th also plans to use recreations this coming 
season as part of a revamping of the show that includes the addition 
of anchor connie chung 
chuck scarborough another cohost of the new nbc show along 
with maria shriver said he did have trepidations about the use 
of recreations but in fact had himself once used a dramatization 
in a story he did on a murder which elicited a letter of complaint 
from an nbc executive in charge of the local new york nbc station 
for which scarborough works 
i think all of us have other assignments within nbc news and 
no one wants to damage their credibility said shriver 
executive producer sid feders suggested recreations are a 
natural next step in television news we have done artists 
renderings we have done animations and drawings i think an 
audience is sophisticated enough and ready for it people arent 
dumb out there 
the questioning of the ytt group followed a press conference 
by gartner who announced that former saturday night live 
producer and current nbc sports president dick ebersol would be 
taking on additional duties in the news division overseeing the 
today show some critics in the audience felt that the no 1 
entertainment network was blurring the lines between entertainment 
and news 
im going to work for michael said ebersol im working 
for a newsman gartner is a former newspaper editor who joined nbc 
last year and when you talk about shows and so forth lets keep 
in mind that all the network news heads today with the exception of 
michael did not start in news one started in politics cbs david 
burke and another one started as the preeminent sports producer of 
our time abcs roone arledge 
the sports department of the new york times certainly talks to 
the metro desk i just say i dont believe in artificial 
barriers but i believe very very strongly in principles and 
guidelines said gartner 
gartner said being the news division in the no 1 entertainment 
network made it harder to get news shows into prime time 
now theres no question that cbs and abc have lets say a 
mediocre primetime schedule he said those networks 
therefore are constantly coming to the news division saying will 
you give us something its cheaper to do a news show and 
thats why they have an easier time 
speaking of nbc he added the overall robustness of the 
network rebounds to the benefit of the news division 
yesterday today and tomorrow will premiere aug 2 as a 
series of specials nbc has not had a weekly primetime news shows 
since 1986 went off the air at the end of that year 
cbs has 60 minutes 48 hours and west 57th abc has 
2020 and the new prime time with diane sawyer and sam 
donaldson

if youre feeling things are 
moving too fast and time doesnt stretch far enough in these modern 
times youre not alone 
a recent international business survey found the predictions at 
the outset of the 1980s that high technology would produce more 
leisure time have not come true 
instead longer hours are common stress levels higher and the 
amount of time available for family and social life reduced 
our observations are that people have become exhausted 
daniel stamp president of priority management said in an 
interview i think the 80s were a time of of massive massive 
change 
the training companys survey of business people stamp described 
as middle management and above found 85 percent worked more than 
45 hours each week 89 percent take work home and 65 percent work 
more than one weekend each month 
fortyeight percent of those surveyed said they experience stress 
every day and 81 percent said they suffer stress at least once a 
week the stress is seen most commonly by headaches and anger and 
its causes are listed first as the job second as interruptions and 
third as the manager or supervisor 
the survey of 1000 people around the world had a response rate 
of 411 percent stamp said he believed it was highly accurate 
among the other findings were that executives are spending more 
time traveling but not on holidays it found 26 percent spend more 
than five weeks each year on business trips and 62 percent take two 
weeks or less of vacation the survey also found signs that family 
and social life may be suffering as a result of the trend to longer 
hours although 52 percent said they spend at least one hour daily 
with their children 27 percent said they spend less than 15 minutes 
it doesnt make you happy working like this stamp said 
its going to inevitably reflect on the working day 
stamp whose office windows offer a panoramic view of vancouvers 
magnificent skyline of skyscrapers sea and snowcapped mountains 
came to canada from britain in 1979 
his experience had been in academics and as he moved into the 
business world he found himself snowed under by the demands of the 
faster pace 
i discovered that nobody had these skills said the trim 
bearded 43yearold i thought it was just me who was going to 
pieces 
the company was started in vancouver in 1984 offering a 
timetext program that teaches how to set priorities and get 
organized 
priority management now headquartered in irving texas has 200 
franchised offices the operation extends to canada the united 
states australia new zealand britain and ireland offices in 
spain and portugal are planned 
the company claims more than 175000 people have gone through its 
programs 
stamp said he adheres to his own advice and sets a working day of 
8 am to 530 pm after that hes home with his family 
there is no loss of income as a result of being balanced he 
said i think its probably quite the opposite 
the companys program asks clients to outline their goals for 
three years they learn to break those targets down to one year and 
finally to one month 
monthly is a great cycle its also reachable stamp said 
on a monthly basis it will guide you 
he said the techniques learned in setting a monthly goal also can 
be applied to daily schedules noting that even something as simple 
as a phone call can take five minutes less time if its planned 
everybody knows the theory you dont have to be a rocket 
scientist stamp said my question is do people practice it

is under a state of emergency declared by us district jude frank 
polozola after a string of murders suicides and escapes this year 
inmates blame roemers stinginess with clemency for the 4800 men 
most serving life or very nearly life 
its the hope of release that generates faith in the system 
when an inmate loses faith you have a ticking time bomb said ron 
wikberg who has served 21 years of a life sentence for murdering a 
grocery clerk during a robbery in lafayette 
roemer granted clemency to four people only one of them from 
angola and approved 10 pardons from march 13 1988 and june 23 
1989 predecessor edwin edwards approved clemency for 42 people and 
22 pardons from march 13 1984 to june 23 1985 the start of his 
last term in office 
inmates accuse roemer of going back on his word to reduce 
sentences fairly based on merit under edwards money and political 
connections got inmates out of prison they said howard marsellus 
edwards pardon board chairman is now serving five years in prison 
for his role in a pardonforsale scandal 
when model prisoners have no hope of release they try to escape 
or kill themselves wikberg said unmodel prisoners assault or 
kill others 
i dont believe thats the problem thats an excuse roemer 
said 
theres two schools of thought said state department of 
corrections chief bruce lynn one inside the prison says they 
need more clemency the people on the outside say no they dont 
the governors caught between a rock and a hard place 
prisoners cite the case of lifer francis corky clifton 52 
who after 27 years in prison was made a trusty tending bloodhounds 
and attack dogs but two months ago he ran away from the house where 
he lived forfeiting the chance to spend the rest of his sentence 
free of chains and cells 
i realized i had a lot to lose clifton said after 
surrendering five days later to think youre going to die here 
it just gets to you it gets to working on your mind 
assistant warden roger thomas said the unwritten message from 
other inmates and employees used to be if you behave yourself in 
10 or 15 or 20 years youre going to be able to go home whats 
happening is the longtermers arent going home 
consequently many prisoners believe they have nothing to lose 
he said 
inmates want only what they have earned said wilbert rideau the 
editor of the awardwinning prison magazine the angolite 
theyre not asking for anything special theyre asking for 
people to treat them fair i cant imagine the average citizen 
having a problem with that said rideau 47 who has served 28 
years of a life sentence for slashing the throat of a bank teller in 
lake charles 
the bottom line is he needs to grant clemency to deserving 
inmates he needs to keep his word to prisoners said floyd webb 
36 who has served nine years of a life sentence for a shotgun 
slaying in st tammany parish 
wikberg 46 an associate editor of the angolite said much of 
the dissatisfaction can be traced to an april 2020 feature on 
rideau and his inability to secure release every inmate at angola 
was watching that show 
in the 2020 piece roemer made his stand on clemency clear 
clifton said that was when he decided to flee 
on may 1 lifer steven calloway howard 34 escaped after 10 
years in prison he was captured nearby three days later 
on may 8 lifer donald fink 39 tried to run off and after 
warning shots was wounded by guards im tired and im going 
home longterm inmate henry patterson quoted fink as saying 
angola has long had a reputation as a hard place the states 38 
death row prisoners live here close to gruesome gertie the 
electric chair used to execute 18 men since 1983 eight were 
executed in the summer of 1987 
the 18000acre prison 50 miles north of baton rouge is 
surrounded by the mississippi river on three sides and the 
impassable tunica hills on the other the location is remote 
accessible only by a single winding dirt road 
in 1971 the american bar association described conditions as 
medieval squalid and horrifying inmates told of the red hat 
where unruly prisoners were kept naked in dark damp dungeons and 
given only spoonfuls of food there were reports of 70 murders in 18 
years and rampant homosexuality 
in 1975 polozola of baton rouge declared the prison in a state 
of emergency ross maggio called the gangster by inmates for 
his unwavering adherence to rules was brought in as warden to scour 
away the blood and filth 
by most accounts he succeeded food was improved wretched 
dining halls were cleaned prisoners were kept busy with work in the 
fields and organized recreation more guards were hired and given 
better pay 
the prison seemed dormant for almost a decade until four murders 
four suicides 64 stabbings and 11 escapes in 14 months forced 
polozola to declare a new state of emergency june 21 another 
suicide occurred earlier this month 
the fury at angola is hidden behind the concertina wire the 
grounds are trim and neat guard towers rise above white fences 
rows of corn and herds of cattle the prison camps look washed and 
the steel bars are painted 
maggio who retired in 1984 is coming back as polozolas 
courtappointed prison specialist but warden hilton butler remains 
in his job polozola will not comment about the case 
maggio is a nervy man kidnapped at knifepoint with his mother by 
two trusties in 1982 he ran his truck into the main gate grabbed a 
pistol from a guard and unloaded it into the cab one inmate was 
killed and another wounded doris maggio then 64 was cut by the 
windshields spraying glass 
butler chosen warden of the year in 1987 by the north american 
association of wardens said maggio isnt needed that there is no 
state of emergency what is needed he said is more guards and 
better pay for them 
for two years butler has run angola with a 46 million budget 
and 1200 guards this year budget cuts deprived guards of the 
100amonth premium for working in a maximumsecurity prison its 
been years since they had a raise 
that doesnt help inmates either wikberg said theres a 
ripple effect here when employees are happy they treat prisoners a 
bit better when theyre demoralized its hard on inmates 
its a situation thats ripe for anything webb said

vincent melomo wants to be a journalist and was 
thrilled to land an internship with a worldwide news agency but 
hes uneasy even anxious 
the news agency is tass the soviet wire service 
i have strong reservations about working for any government 
organization thats primarily a propaganda device said the 
20yearold history major but that was overcome by saying well 
i have to see it see how it works see what my involvement is 
before i can really make such lofty decisions 
for the first time the new york bureau of tass has taken on 
american university students as unpaid summer interns covering 
metropolitan news the agency hopes to spruce up its image in the 
united states and help turn its englishlanguage service into a 
moneymaking enterprise 
to that end tass also has hired irene stevenson 28 a graduate 
student of slavic studies at the university of texas to edit its 
englishlanguage wire at its moscow headquarters she is to start 
work in september 
we are trying to show that we are not really the voice of the 
government said igor y makurin the new york bureau chief the 
government told us you are on your own you have to earn your 
living we have to find means to be selfsufficient to earn our 
money to pay our bills to pay our lunch 
tass englishlanguage wire has 11 us customers including the 
new york times the associated press the united nations and several 
databanks but that isnt enough to make the service profitable and 
makurin described two recent efforts to market the wire in the 
united states as a disaster 
in 1987 tass sent brochures and letters to 3000 us radio 
stations out of eight to 10 responses none signed on last year 
it contacted 75 newspapers and eight agreed to a free twomonth 
subscription all canceled after that 
one criticism was that the english tass was putting on the wire 
was unfit for american consumption makurin said you write a 
story in russian and then the guy in moscow translates it into 
english and the service sometimes is very clumsy the translation 
is clumsy and a lot of mistakes 
sometimes our subscribers call us and ask what do you mean by 
saying this or something is funny for example passover 
was once translated as jewish history he said 
enter the american students 
the interns started working on memorial day the three american 
undergraduates and one swedish graduate student all of whom are 
studying at local universities were selected from six applicants 
during their first week the interns wrote about the van cliburn 
international piano competition in fort worth texas whose 
semifinalists included three soviet pianists a sovietamerican 
sailing expedition and a recent anthology of soviet and american 
writers the human experience 
the students hope their stories will be used by a news 
organization in one of the 115 countries that have tass subscribers 
when i write a story i imagine that it might be picked up in an 
african country that relies on tass for information said sofia 
gustafsson 29 a graduate journalism student at new york university 
and un tour guide 
i probably dont realize the importance of the whole thing 
said laura yow 19 of suburban philadelphia who will be a 
sophomore at barnard college its just a place that i go and i am 
working for them 
i dont look at it as a sovietamerican thing but as a 
journalism thing said miss yow who is working mornings at tass 
and afternoons selling crystal and china at tiffanys a fiveminute 
walk up fifth avenue from tass offices in rockefeller plaza 
miss gustafsson agreed it seems to me like any other news 
service all the big papers are here the press releases seem to 
arrive calls are made the things that i would expect to find in 
any news organization are here 
but melomo who will be a senior at adelphi university in the 
fall does not consider tass just any news organization and 
although he is reluctant to admit it he is having second thoughts 
about working there 
i consider myself a progressive sort of person and i like to be 
contributing to whatever societal progress we are having between the 
two countries and if i can help any way i suppose this is it 
and yet he is skeptical 
my father once worked for the government and he had to get a 
security clearance and theres a lot that goes into that and he 
warned me to at least investigate this said melomo whose family 
lives in knoxville tenn 
plus i know in certain areas of the country in the more 
conservative south i dont know how they would welcome someone who 
worked for tass im just aware of other people and other times and 
how this thing would be viewed rather than just right now when 
everything seems so harmonious times change 
but for now the times are good 
in the last few years sovietamerican relations have changed 
dramatically and so too has the operation of tass said makurin 
who has worked in the new york bureau for nine years and been its 
chief since 1987 
two to three years ago most story assignments were made in 
moscow now the bureau can file directly on the russian wire without 
editing in moscow 
we decide here what kind of story well write here weve got 
freedom of choice said makurin a warm genial man the students 
have taken to him and respect his editorial judgment he reads their 
stories and edits them 
i know what is the news and i try to show them how to make 
their stories readable but i dont want to force anything 
what does makurin want the americans to take away from their 
three months 
something good about tass that were not bad guys 
i want them to find out the way we work in the united states 
it should be educational for them especially at the present 
time when relations between the two countries are not that bad 
maybe it could improve our relations not on the official level 
but on the level of common people

a year after the first major roman catholic 
schism in a century the vatican admits it has been unable to 
curtail the ultratraditionalist movement of marcel lefebvre the 
rebel archbishop 
both sides say lefebvre has gained thousands of followers since 
he was excommunicated for consecrating four bishops in defiance of 
papal orders 
cardinal paul augustin mayer head of a papal commission charged 
in july 1988 with keeping traditionalists in the church says many 
bishops resist a vatican effort to make the old latin mass more 
available 
among traditionalist catholics there is an attitude of 
desperation and because of that an evergreater number of them 
consider returning to monsignor lefebvre as the only possible 
response the west german cardinal said in an interview with the 
italian catholic monthly 30 giorni 30 days 
some catholics believe the church should be cautious with 
compromise church sources said the presidents of the bishops 
conferences of england france west germany and switzerland told 
pope john paul ii in may he was going too far in wooing 
traditionalists 
lefebvre 83 rejects the reforms of the 196265 second vatican 
council including acceptance of religious freedom celebration of 
the mass in local languages and interfaith cooperation 
john paul said after the schism june 30 1988 that followers of 
the french archbishop faced excommunication unless they renounced 
him but even the threat of expulsion the churchs gravest 
punishment has not hindered the movement 
spokesmen for lefebvre said only 16 priests had left his st pius 
x fraternity based in switzerland since the split with the vatican 
and 34 had been ordained bringing the number of priests to 222 
they said the number of faithful had increased by 10 percent to 
15 percent the papal commission serving traditionalists ecclesia 
dei said attendance at lefebvre churches in many areas had grown by 
30 percent 
an overall view of the statistics would indicate this 
particular challenge is not being effectively met on the part of the 
official church structure said a vatican official familiar with 
the work of ecclesia dei speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said the lefebvre movement was growing in leaps and bounds 
in the united states and expanding in france australia and south 
america 
ecclesia dei officials say the attraction of the renegade 
movement is mostly its use of the 16th century latin tridentine 
mass which was suppressed after vatican ii in the new mass the 
local language is used and the priest faces the congregation instead 
of the altar 
cardinal mayer said in the interview with 30 giorni that many 
bishops have ignored the popes request a year ago to make full 
and generous application of a 1984 decree allowing the tridentine 
rite to be used in special circumstances 
lay people know this and their response in england france 
america has been to turn to the st pius x fraternity of monsignor 
lefebvre he said 
the lefebvre movement claims millions of sympathizers and vatican 
estimates put its membership at 100000 to 12 million the roman 
catholic church has about 850 million members 
an official at the us national catholic conference of bishops 
familiar with the traditionalist issue said privately the vast 
overwhelming majority of american catholics support the new mass 
he also said the lefebvre movement goes far beyond preference for 
the latin mass to embrace social economic and political stances 
lefebvre is an ardent anticommunist some officials of his 
movement say they doubt the holocaust in which the nazis killed 6 
million jews during world war ii in may a frenchman accused of 
crimes against humanity as head of a pronazi militia was captured 
in a french priory run by lefebvre followers 
in october the vatican recognized the fraternity of st peter a 
traditionalist order led by a former lefebvre official the 
fraternity with 18 priests and 30 seminarians encourages 
lefebvres followers to return to the church 
ecclesia dei has granted special permission to more than 150 
priests to use the old mass and has received scores more requests 
from priests who chose to ask the vatican instead of their local 
bishop 
vatican efforts to blunt the impact of his renegade movement have 
irritated lefebvre making it unlikely the church will be able to 
heal its first major schism since the old catholics left the church 
in 1870 over the issue of papal infallibility 
they are waging an indecent war against us lefebvre was 
quoted as saying in 30 giornis latest issue how is it possible 
to have a dialogue with these men

dwayne reddings voice softens and his eyes cloud 
with dark memories as he talks about the year he turned 15 
that was 1981 and redding was a high school sophomore with 
college plans and a parttime job he also was a young black male in 
a city where his type was being hunted down by a wily killer who 
already had gotten someone redding knew 
i was frightened i mean i really was frightened because it 
hit close to home he said thats when it crossed my mind that 
i could become a victim 
here i was a 15yearold kid working at a dairy queen until 
11 or 12 oclock at night what saved me from being a victim 
the killings began 10 years ago soon bringing terror for the 
children of atlantas black neighborhhoods residents believed the 
deaths were linked after about four bodies were found months before 
police officially announced a connection from july 28 1979 until 
may 24 1981 28 victims slipped into the clutches of a killer 
finally there was an arrest selfstyled music promoter wayne b 
williams a pudgy bespectacled young black man was convicted of 
two murders and sentenced to life in prison police also blamed 
williams for 22 other slayings 
not everyone accepted williams connection to the other killings 
and some people still push for the cases to be reexamined 
from the time edward smith and alford evans were found dead in a 
weedy lot until nathaniel caters naked body surfaced in the 
chattahoochee river young black men in atlanta lived with the fear 
they could be next but they never really talked about it 
they say counseling efforts never reached far enough into their 
circles psychologists say many children shunned counseling either 
out of bravado or confusion 
whatever the reason these grown men when they reflect upon 
their childhood horror feel their generation was abandoned 
we need to deal with it get it out and talk about it its not 
too late to do that said derrick boazman a 23yearold student 
at morris brown college its a must for the sake of justice 
that we reexamine the whole issue it needs to be brought to the 
forefront 
boazman was 13 when the murders began by the time they ended he 
had joined a youth group the united youthadult conference and 
given up activities that kept him out after dark 
we were kind of scared we didnt want to say we were he 
said it was a saddening feeling to think that someone out there 
was preying upon and victimizing children 
redding 23 a student at georgia state university didnt say 
much to anyone about the murders until 1986 some soul searching 
prompted him to think more about timothy hill a victim who had 
frequented the ice cream parlor where redding worked at the time 
hills body was found march 30 1981 
he was a likeable kind of kid he liked to talk to you 
redding said ill never forget the day of his funeral seeing the 
funeral procession everybody was silent and saddened and it was 
kind of weird being that close to someone who had been the victim of 
what i still consider an unsolved murder 
it never occurred to me to go to counseling it hit me later 
it prompted me to be a bit more introspective about the magnitude of 
what had taken place it is an issue a lot of people would rather 
forget about and i cant understand that 
the fear still haunts michael hardnett 26 an electrician 
i thought if it could happen to them it could happen to me 
too cause back then i used to hang out in the late hours he 
said every time i left the house and hit the street i felt i had 
to be on my guard i had to watch my back 
now ill go out and when i leave im always looking out the 
door or down the street when i hear something i want to know what 
it is 
hardnett said his friends didnt want to accept what was 
happening 
a couple of them they didnt want to say they were scared but 
id say they were scared he said i wasnt just going to ignore 
it i knew i was a small person and i could get picked up that 
easily 
boazman said he had not been overwhelmingly concerned with the 
murders until a schoolmate from his neighborhood 12yearold 
charles stephens was murdered oct 9 1980 
it struck home for me ill never forget it i didnt want to 
be caught outside after it had gotten dark boazman said now 
the magnitude is still a quandary for me if i had been approached 
or accosted it would have been terrifying 
as lawyers prepare new appeals for williams the young men who 
could have been victims say they do not believe williams committed 
all the murders pinned on him they say those cases should be 
reopened 
they say the public was never fully aware of other suspects in 
the case police questioned hundreds of possible suspects they 
arrested a relative in the case of 7yearold latonya wilson but 
released him later 
the young men criticize mayor andrew young and public safety 
commissioner george napper both of whom are black for not renewing 
investigations of the 22 cases linked to williams who was arrested 
in june 1981 and charged with murdering cater and 21yearold jimmy 
ray payne 
i never felt in my heart that wayne williams was the killer of 
all those persons i really feel it was a conspiracy boazman 
said to close the doors on all the rest is an injustice whatever 
happened to the leads on them the public doesnt know 
it was politically expedient to keep it hushed he said 
here we have in the black community all these heinous crimes 
then have a black man convicted to see another young intelligent 
black man arrested and sent to jail for those cases the 
psychological effect could be lasting 
hardnett agreed it just seemed like they were after anybody to 
me they just said well he did it i really just thought it was 
wrong because to me they just didnt care about the other cases 
prosecutors decline to comment because of williams impending bid 
for a new trial but larry howard who was director of the state 
crime lab during the killings says dog hairs carpet fibers and 
other evidence painstakingly plucked from victims bodies solidly 
linked the bulk of the murdered children to williams 
i think in those cases where we identified physical evidence 
there was a single person i think we identified williams as that 
person howard said from his retirement home in montana we were 
pretty much on target 
redding who leads a group that monitors racial situations on 
college campuses in georgia said he also doubts williams guilt 
because the citys leadership seemed to thirst and hunger for a 
scapegoat once williams was arrested 
i feel justice must be served he said we have to 
investigate these crimes just as thoroughly and just as severely as 
the jews have continued to investigate those who were perpetrators 
of nazi acts of war 
we have to be that serious about it

in just over a decade a heart procedure called 
angioplasty has grown from a hightech experiment to a treatment 
widely available in community hospitals cardiologists have rushed 
to offer a service that clearly helps patients but many are poorly 
trained and inexperienced in a continuing series the business of 
medicine science writer daniel q haney and national writer fred 
bayles look at how large fees determine who does angioplasty 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
more than 200000 americans will have balloons 
thrust into their hearts this year often by doctors who are 
inexperienced poorly traind and motivated in part by the big fees 
they can earn 
many attempt the delicate procedure known as angioplasty once a 
month or less colleagues say some are so unskilled that hospital 
technicians must lead them through the work step by step 
many top heart specialists believe these lowvolume doctors are 
often incompetent at angioplasty yet there is almost nothing to 
stop them typically hospitals allow their cardiologists to perform 
the work alone after taking a threeday course or doing a few 
operations with a colleague 
it has been wide open to anyone who can convince their patients 
to have it said dr stephen oesterle who performs 250 a year at 
los angeles good samaritan hospital 
angioplasty is unquestionably an important medical advance 
capable of relieving angina chest pain for many people with heart 
disease 
last year an estimated 235000 patients underwent the procedure 
doctors fish wires through the plugged blood vessels of the heart 
then inflate balloons that squeeze back fatty buildups that block 
the flow of blood when all goes well doctors remove the wires and 
balloons and blood sails smoothly through the dilated arteries 
but many of the nations leading cardiologists worry that 
angioplasty has spread too quickly into too many small hospitals 
where it is performed by too many doctors with too little experience 
for an hour or so of work doctors typically charge about 2000 
in the view of many those who attempt an occasional angioplasty are 
motivated more by whats good for them financially than whats good 
for their patients 
its dilate for dollars said a worried dr thomas ryan of 
boston university medical center 
almost everyone agrees that in angioplasty practice makes 
perfect 
there is no such thing as a good lowfrequency operator you 
cannot do that kind of medicine on a casual basis because it 
requires technical skill that comes from doing it regularly said 
dr bernadine healy of the cleveland clinic she like ryan is a 
former president of the american heart association 
among small hospitals doing a low volume of angioplasty is 
229bed garfield medical center in monterey park just east of los 
angeles the hospitals cardiac catheterization lab where the 
procedure is performed is headed by dr eugene margolis 
he has done 148 angioplasties in nine years making him the 
hospitals most experienced angioplastor last year he performed 
52 while the four other doctors who work there did 17 14 10 and 
nine 
in his view performing two procedures a month is sufficient to 
maintain proficiency but he added i have people who work at our 
lab that if i had the power to just say you stop id do it 
either they are too nervous they dont have the experience or 
they dont do that good a job 
two of his colleagues whom he did not name are particularly 
unsure of themselves he said they sometimes literally have the 
technician almost have to do the case for them the technicians know 
enough to walk the doctors through the case if they have to 
bruce lopez a registered nurse who is one of the labs 
technicians confirmed this 
we are not physicians but we have as much experience as they 
do he said we dont like to be put in the position with 
inexperienced angioplastors of telling them what to do next 
why do these people perform angioplasties at all because its 
lucrative and everybody wants a piece of the pie said margolis 
the occasional angioplastors are allowed to continue at his 
hospital because no patients have died he said if they were 
killing people you could do something 
margolis explained unless something is really gross its hard 
to get doctors to stop doing what theyre doing to take away their 
priveleges we dont have anybody that bad 
even in inexperienced hands angioplasty is rarely fatal 
however less experienced doctors complication rates can be higher 
they are less likely to react appropriately in emergencies and they 
have less success with the basic goal of reopening clogged heart 
arteries 
at garfield for instance margolis said 75 percent of 
angioplasties are initially successful and 4 percent to 5 percent 
of patients require emergency bypass operations when the procedure 
abruptly closes an artery instead of widening it 
a few miles away at good samaritan where eight doctors do about 
700 angioplasties a year the figures are considerably better 95 
percent of angioplasties are initially successful and 3 percent 
require emergency surgery 
competition among doctors and hospitals to perform angioplasty is 
particularly intense in california usci division of cr bard inc 
which makes angioplasty equipment estimates that 850 hospitals in 
the united states performed angioplasty last year and 114 of them 
or 13 percent were in california 
however experts say the motivation to perform a few procedures 
each year exists everywhere money is seen as a chief reason 
this is an ethical issue because if there was no monetary 
incentive they would refer them to the experts and not do it 
themselves said dr augusto pichard of washington hospital center 
in the nations capital 
pichard said doctors also are motivated by the desire to hold 
onto patients some cardiologists worry that if they send 
angioplasty cases to competitors they will never see those patients 
again 
another reason is ego dr hjc swan of cedarssinai medical 
center in los angeles said many seem to tell themselves if im a 
cardiologist and ive had some training in angioplasty by god i can 
do it and by god i can do it just as well as the big shot at the 
big medical center whos doing 10 a day 
finally there is the prestige of being part of the most 
technologically advanced branch of heart medicine

<TEXT>
exactly how many angioplastors are at the low end of the volume 
scale is unknown but even an industry official uscis marketing 
vice president claudia russell called it an unfortunately high 
number 
ryan went further i think the unskilled angioplastors 
outnumber the skilled ones he said 
ryan is helping draw up voluntary angioplasty standards for the 
heart association the american college of cardiology and american 
college of physicians sources said ryans committee is expected to 
recommend that doctors perform at least 75 angioplasties annually or 
stop doing them 
several experts said 50 is a bare minimum necessary to maintain 
the competence to do simple angioplasties and yet that may be only 
the average number done annually by each of the roughly 4600 
cardiologists who perform them 
not everybody who has a catheterization lab should have the 
privilege of being able to do angioplasty said dr david faxon 
who does 200 a year at boston university medical center i think 
it should be restricted 
dr spencer king iii of emory university in atlanta who does 500 
angioplasties annually said the number of doctors doing the 
procedure is still growing and money has to be a reason 
the young cardiologists dont want to go into office 
practice he said they dont want to run coronary care units 
they dont even want to do nuclear cardiology they want to do 
cardiac catheterization and angioplasty and those are the highest 
ticket items its fun but it aint that much fun

if a doctor says you need an angioplasty 
heres a word of advice from the experts make sure your physician 
is competent 
how ask lots of questions 
many people are reluctant to challenge their physicians skill at 
doing the procedure perhaps because they fear the doctor will be 
insulted 
people spend more time in los angeles searching out the right 
restaurants than the right person to perform a procedure that 
potentially threatens their lives said dr stephen oesterle of 
good samaritan hospital 
but top cardiologists say that good practitioners will not be put 
off by reasonable questions here are some to ask 
how many angioplasties have you done 
experts say 50 a year is a bare minimum to keep up competence 
several cardiologists said they would not have the procedure done on 
themselves by doctors who perform fewer than 200 annually 
do you routinely do angioplasties in cases as complicated as 
mine 
a single narrowing in one heart artery is easier to treat than 
multiple blockages in several arteries if your problem is complex 
make sure the doctor has already successfully handled similar cases 
what is your success rate 
doctors who specialize in angioplasty are routinely able to 
initially open up 95 percent or more of blocked arteries about 3 
percent of their patients require emergency bypass surgery and less 
than 1 percent die 
will a skilled team of heart surgeons be waiting in case 
something goes wrong 
surgical backup in the same hospital is considered mandatory 
are there are other options that might be better for me

a few weeks after ronald reagan was shot in 
1981 by a wouldbe assassin he was asked if he now favored gun 
control no he said it doesnt do any good 
a few weeks after a man opened fire with an ak47 in a schoolyard 
in stockton calif george bush who had come to office just as 
adamant as reagan on gun control switched signals 
his administration imposed a temporary ban now made permanent 
on imports of semiautomatic weapons deemed to have no legitimate 
sporting purposes 
slowly without calling attention to the process the bush 
administration has turned away from positions firmly held by ronald 
reagan and warmly endorsed in 1988 by candidate bush 
in place of a reagan evolution is a bush evolution 
now six months after bush stepped into 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
theres evidence aplenty that the new conservative president has 
parted company from the old conservative president 
on mideast policy pollution issues the minimum wage the 
defense budget budgetary matters in general on star wars and the 
sale of oil leases aid to the contras and fuel economy standards 
for automobiles bush has abandoned the reagan agenda for his own 
positions usually they are more to the left of where reagan stood 
political analysts arent surprised 
some change is inevitable says c lowell harris former 
executive director of the academy of political science after four 
or eight years there are bound to be occasions where new looks at 
things even by people who are fundamentally sympathetic to the 
earlier policies are inevitable 
stephen hess a political scientist at the brookings institution 
says a vice president after years in the shadows has a visceral 
need to show his differences to show a streak of independence 
when he takes over as no 1 
bush would say there is more thats alike than different and 
he would probably be right hess says but whats different is 
whats interesting and what makes news 
william schneider of the american enterprise institute says each 
man revealed his own character in his presidency 
reagan was an agenda president who appointed people like 
edward meese iii jeane kirkpatrick elliott abrams oliver north to 
carry out his agenda and theirs he says 
bush on the other hand is an inbasket president you figure 
out what the problems are and you deal with them 
here are some places where bush has abandoned reagan policies

contra aid reagan once summed up his policy toward the leftist 
nicaraguan government in two words say uncle for eight years 
he did whatever he could to help the contras overthrow that 
government when congress cut off funds for military aid the 
irancontra affair resulted 
just two months into office bush struck a deal with congress 
that gave up reagans goal the new president made it clear he was 
willing to accept a future in which the leftist sandinistas remain 
in power in managua 
much like a treaty between nations a fourpage agreement was 
signed by bush and congressional leaders after secret negotiations 
on capitol hill by secretary of state james a baker iii 
it provided 45 million a month in nonlethal aid to the 
contras chiefly intended to encourage them to return home and 
battle the sandinistas in the political rather than the military 
arena even that limited aid would be cut off automatically if the 
contras engaged in military attacks or crossborder incursions

star wars with great fanfare in a television speech to the 
nation on march 23 1983 reagan announced plans for a spacebased 
defense system against intercontinental missiles the system that 
became known as star wars 
ive become more and more deeply convinced that the human 
spirit must be capable of rising above dealing with other nations 
and human beings by threatening their existence said a president 
whose commitment to the idea was evident to anyone watching 
billions of dollars later bush appears to be edging away from 
the reagan commitment the first clue of that came from john g 
tower while he was still hopeful of being confirmed as secretary of 
defense 
tower testified that he personally did not believe that we can 
devise an umbrella that can protect the entire american 
population from nuclear incineration 
an umbrella exactly like that was the star wars goal that 
reagan envisioned 
bush cut spending on the program to 46 billion for fiscal 1990 
down from the 59 billion reagan had proposed defense secretary 
dick cheney also announced that bush would shift the focus of star 
wars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a more 
advanced system known as brilliant pebbles consisting of 3000 
to 5000 small orbiting satellites each capable of tracking and 
destroying an intercontinental ballistic missile 
whether bush will be any more willing than reagan to use star 
wars as a bargaining chip in arms control negotiations with the 
soviets remains to be seen

mideast the reagan administration opened contacts with the 
palestine liberation organization but was careful to go no further 
than nudge the israelis toward seeking a settlement with the arabs 
substance did not change but emphasis did in the bush 
administration 
the nudge became a shove when baker replaced secretary of state 
george p shultz 
two speeches show the change in tone 
shultz on sept 16 1988 israel will never negotiate from or 
return to the lines of partition but it must be prepared to 
withdraw from territories occupied in the recent conflict 
baker on may 22 telling israel to forswear annexation of 
the occupied territories now is the time to lay aside once and 
for all the unrealistic vision of a greater israel

budget a state of budgetary warfare existed for most of the 
reagan presidency between the white house and the 
democraticcontrolled congress after months of stalemate the 
october 1987 stock market crash which was fed by concern over 
federal deficits made both sides agree they had no choice but to 
compromise 
the result was a budget accord that reagan swallowing hard 
signed off on it provided for new taxes that he had opposed and 
cuts in defense spending 
when reagan left office bush inherited a reagan budget proposal 
that called for more growth in military spending bush revised it 
the pentagon budget would stay abreast of inflation but not grow 
beyond it 
taking a cue from bushs inaugural address to my friends and 
yes i do mean friends in the loyal opposition and yes i do mean 
loyal i put out my hand bushs budget negotiators quickly 
struck a deal with congress 
bush accepted even less for the military and more for domestic 
programs bragging of a budget compromise that for the first time 
was reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of a 
crisis

gun control each time he was asked if the shooting by john 
hinckley hadnt changed his mind on gun control reagan said no he 
said hinckley broke a district of columbia law and more laws 
wouldnt make any difference 
that view was shared by bush too when he took office but the 
new president changed his tune before he did so his wife took a 
stand 
in the aftermath of the stockton calif schoolyard shooting 
that left five children dead and 29 wounded barbara bush said she 
absolutely favored a ban on semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons 
even then bush held firm but a public outcry joined in by 
police over the widespread availability of semiautomatic weapons 
changed the atmosphere the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
responded it froze then banned imports of those weapons which it 
said were not suitable for sport

the environment midway in his presidency reagan called his 
environmental record one of the best kept secrets in washington 
but even anne burford his first head of the environmental 
protection agency and herself a target of environmentalists 
criticism became a critic of reagans record 
we dont have an environmental policy in this administration 
she said three years after leaving office 
bush said in june that it is time to break the stalemate that 
has hindered progress on clean air for the past decade and 
announced proposals for revising the clean air act unchanged for a 
dozen years 
bushs program is intended to clean up the smog in most cities by 
the year 2000 and sharply reduce the forest and lakekilling 
pollution known as acid rain it provides for a 50 percent reduction 
in sulfur dioxide emissions from coalburning power plants that are 
a chief cause of acid rain it also calls for a phasein of cars 
powered by methanol and a requirement that industry use new 
technology to curb the release of cancercausing chemicals 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney said the bush proposal was 
the most positive move by the united states in a decade of canadian 
complaints about acid rain 
the bush administration also has proposed higher fuel economy 
standards for automobiles standards that reagan had tried to 
eliminate outright

oil lease sales reagan had proposed leasing three areas off the 
coasts of northern and southern california and southern florida for

significant adverse environmental effects that have not been

minimum wage from franklin roosevelt to jimmy carter the 
minimum wage was increased under every president until reagan it 
was fixed at 335 an hour when reagan took office in 1981 and it 
remained there when he left reagan proposed a lower rate for young 
people 250 but no increase for other workers 
bush retained the idea of a lower minimum for youth this time 
dubbed a training wage but announced his willingness to accept 
an increase in the minimum wage to 425 over three years 
democrats in congress pushed through an increase to 455 with a 
subminimum to be paid workers with less than two months work

r gordon hoxie president of the new yorkbased center for the 
study of the presidency thinks the nation is now seeing the real 
george bush 
prior to 1980 there was a great difference between him and 
reagan so he had to always submerge those differences hoxie said 
bushs whole approach to things is different he says hes 
far more of a handson president than his predecessor 
i think this president is much more sensitive to minority group 
interests and i think hes going to make headway with blacks and 
hispanics hoxie adds calling attention to one more area of 
difference 
bush paid tribute to the late martin luther king as an american 
hero in 1983 reagan was asked about charges by sen jesse helms 
rnc that king had communist sympathies referring to future 
declassification of justice department records reagan replied 
well know in about 35 years wont we he subsequently 
apologized to kings widow 
hess says bush no matter how he departs from reagans record is 
careful to pay homage to reagan 
there will be a time when george bush needs ronald reagan in a 
midterm election he may wish to use reagan or if theres a severe 
economic downturn hess says 
so hes got to be very attentive personally while making the 
proper separations politically thats the trick

a chinese government company has given an 
american camera maker the right to lease 60 million square feet of 
land for up to 25 years and sublease it to other foreign firms that 
want to manufacture in china 
the concord camera corp signed the unusual agreement monday in 
hong kong with the wan kong economic development corp of baoan 
county 
the deal appears to be an attempt on chinas part to help regain 
the confidence of western investors following the june crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators that left hundreds of people dead 
many foreign business representatives fled the country during the 
turmoil and the repercussions are believed to be having a serious 
impact on the nations economy 
under the agreement concord based in rahway nj will 
sublease manufacturing space and supply labor to other corporations 
that want to operate in the newly formed industrial park in baoan 
prounced bowahn in southern chinas guangdong province about 15 
miles north of hong kong 
jack benun chairman of concord declined to say how much the 
deal was worth he said his company had yet to determine how much it 
would charge for space in the industrial park 
over the weekend the official china news service quoted a 
chinese official from southern hainan province as saying china 
wanted to proceed with another project that also allows a foreign 
firm to lease space to foreign investors 
an official at the hong kong office of that firm kumagai gumi 
the japanese construction giant said monday the firm had no comment 
on the chinese report about the yongpu port 
in recent weeks hong kong newspapers have said conservative 
chinese officials who have gained power as a result of the 
crackdown had criticized projects such as these the officials were 
quoted as saying the projects were tantamount to selling chinas 
sovereignty to foreigners 
to increase confidence of potential investors benun said 
concord was planning to establish an insurance company that would 
guarantee assets on the leased property but he said his firm hadnt 
arranged the details yet 
benun said he secured the deal during a visit of top officials 
from baoan county to his new jersey home several weeks ago the 
basis of the deal he said was concords sixyear relationship with 
the county 
concord began producing cameras in baoan in 1983 and has gone 
from occupying 10000 square feet of space to its current production 
facilities of 240000 square feet it now employs 2000 chinese 
benun said concord makes approximately 4 million cameras a year 
55 percent of which are sold in the united states and 45 percent in 
europe and asia 
benun said he did not believe the recent unrest in china would 
affect his investment 
its our belief that with six years under our belt and with the 
local authorities having always delivered what they promised there 
should be no reason why anything should change benun said 
he said the space to be leased is currently fields and mountains 
asked why the chinese were willing to grant leasing rights to a 
foreign firm benun said he believed the chinese saw the need for 
foreign help in marketing china 
its like a company with a good product needing a little 
marketing help he said they believed that the management of 
our company would tell the story better even than they could

unilateral us action both in the hormone dispute and in a 
conflict over eec soybean imports 
we continue to contest unilateral actions taken by the us 
he said 
britain had proposed exempting oxtongues a popular food there

that might have enabled the us to reduce its retaliatory duties 
on 100 million worth of eec goods british officials said

the british proposal because it would have required a change in eec 
laws and would have damaged the credibility of the ban on hormones 
an italian proposal for the eec to erect countermeasures against

the house by voice vote approved legislation 
that would allow farmers to plant some alternative crops without 
losing their acreage base for federal farm programs 
the bill was sent monday to the senate where there has been no 
action on similar legislation the bush administration has no 
objection to the bill 
under the measure farmers in 1990 could plant up to 20 percent 
of the acreage designated for program crops such as wheat feed 
grains cotton and rice with certain alternatives namely canola 
rapeseed sunflower safflower flaxseed kenaf crambe guayule 
milkseed and meadowfoam 
the legislation allows the alternative planting without causing 
loss of the acreage base used to determine eligibilty for federal 
farm programs 
the government would require farmers to plant at least 50 percent 
of their acreage in program crops in order to be eligible to plant 
alternatives 
the congressional budget office estimates that the bill would 
save the government 10 million in fiscal 1990 and 15 million in 
fiscal 1991 because of reductions in deficiency payments and storage 
and handling payments for program commodities

operation 
we said some time ago that the new drexel would not countenance 
improper behavior and we meant it drexel chief executive fred

commissions and trading profits on the transaction

falsified documents during repsols offer of 7995 million shares at 
the equivalent of 1470 each or a total of 114 billion the 
shares were sold to 400000 investors worldwide from april 20 to may 
6 
in a filing with spanish securities regulators drexel requested 
a block of the shares worth about 60 million and said they would go 
to the 400 individual investors but officials said that on may 11 
the first day of public trading drexel improperly sold the shares 
to the private institutions 
spanish regulators said last week that some of the 400 investors 
mainly friends and relatives of drexel employees were unaware their 
names had been used as nominees for the stock in repsol europes 
eighthlargest oil company 
results of the investigation in spain have not been announced 
drexel could be fined up to five times the profit on the 
transaction in the case according to reports from spain criminal 
charges also are possible if drexel used investors names without 
their permission the reports said 
drexel said dbl capital markets espana officials waited 10 days 
before telling the parent company that spanish authorities had 
requested information about the repsol transaction 
drexel also said it was withdrawing its application for a 
brokerage license in spain the firm said spanish authorities had 
not requested the withdrawal 
drexels madrid office which opened in 1987 employed 27 people 
in his statement joseph said there were reports in spain that 
other firms in madrid engaged in similar transactions during the 
repsol offering but that is something for spanish authorities to 
determine 
for drexel it is behavior which we find unacceptable and 
cannot condone and is clearly not the manner in which we plan to 
conduct business joseph said 
we recognize that the decision to close is a drastic step 
however prompt response was called for he said 
drexel last year agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a 
record 650 million to settle us securities law violations 
stemming from the governments crackdown on wall street crime 
drexel also agreed to overhaul its management and toughen its 
internal compliance systems

in a period of sluggish investor activity 
prudentialbache securities inc is getting a bargain by purchasing 
the retail brokerage division of struggling wall street firm thomson 
mckinnon inc analysts say 
after canceling a full merger the two investment firms announced 
monday the sale that will add thomson mckinnons 2000 brokers at 
154 offices to prudentialbaches sales force of 6000 
the deal comes during a period of retrenchment on wall street and 
sustained skepticism about whether individual investors scared off 
by the 1987 stock market crash will ever return to the market in 
precrash numbers drexel burnham lambert inc recently sold its 
entire retail unit to smith barney harris upham amp co 
if you acquire a firm with a lot of brokers its an opportunity 
to expand for a very low cost said brenda davis mccoy who 
follows the securities industry for painewebber inc 
a merger agreement between the two investment firms announced 
june 13 was scrapped friday after prudentialbache discovered 
problems with thomson mckinnons financial records 
when it became clear a merger was not feasible rather than 
parting ways we worked together to develop this new arrangement 
prudentialbache chairman george l ball and thomson mckinnon 
chairman j ronald morgan said in a statement 
prudentialbache the nations fourthlargest securities firm 
will acquire thomson mckinnons retail business and customer 
accounts officials said the combined retail sales force at 
prudentialbache which has more than 320 offices would be trimmed 
by an undetermined amount 
thomson mckinnon had 4700 employees before the sale 
terms were not disclosed but people familiar with the deal said 
prudentialbache will pay 60 million up front plus another 60 
million over three years in incentives designed to keep thomson 
mckinnon brokers from leaving 
the sale effectively marks the end 104yearold of thomson 
mckinnon which has struggled since the market crash and repeatedly 
entered into sale negotiations with other major brokerages 
thomson mckinnon officials said the firm planned to sell its 
remaining assets such as its capital markets hong kong and 
administrative operations in the coming months 
among problems that led to scrapping the merger was a reported 
80 million difference between thomson mckinnons liabilities and 
cash reserves weekend negotiations yielded the retail brokerage 
deal 
prudentialbache is the brokerage arm of prudential securities 
which is owned by prudential insurance co of america 
prudentialbache also said it plans to purchase about 5 percent 
of thomson mckinnon asset management lp the firms only publicly 
traded entity which operates its money and investment management 
business the partnerships unit price closed down 50 cents at 10 
in new york stock exchange trading monday 
under the deal thomson mckinnon brokers will not be able to sell 
prudentialbache money market mutual funds once they join that firm 
officials said the split was designed to prevent brokers from 
selling only prudentialbache funds and to keep the thomson mckinnon 
asset management fund alive 
thomson mckinnon brokers will continue to offer other nonmoney 
market mutual funds managed by the asset management group also 
prudentialbache brokers will not sell thomson mckinnon mutual funds 
last october privately held thomson mckinnon the nations 
ninthlargest brokerage said it was looking for a buyer to purchase 
the 23 percent thomson mckinnon stake owned by the hartford 
insurance group a unit of itt corp 
itt spokesman jim gallagher said monday the company may have to 
increase to 275 million from 23 million the secondquarter 
reserve it expects to take from the sale of hartford insurances 
stake in thomson mckinnon reducing itts earnings by 19 cents a 
share 
itt said the size of the reserve depends on thomson mckinnons 
ability to pay hartford for the 23 percent stake under the aborted 
june 13 merger agreement hartford was to sell back all its shares 
to thomson mckinnon

computerized job interviews make people more 
honest but less comfortable a recent study found 
applicants tend to give straighter answers to computers possibly 
because they believe the computer is more likely to catch a lie 
according to the study but some people particularly those seeking 
higherlevel jobs resent placing their job future in the hands of a 
machine 
the study was done with students in simulated job interviews it 
was conducted by dennis nagao a researcher at the georgia institute 
of technologys college of management and christopher martin of 
louisiana state university 
a growing number of companies are using computers to conduct 
initial job interviews the applicant answers a series of questions 
on a computer terminal and if the responses show promise the job 
seeker will be called back for a followup 
in the case where you have a higherlevel job your expectation 
probably includes some kind of facetoface interview nagao said 
these people come in expecting to get a little more detail 
someone to answer their questions 
the validity of the responses was checked by comparing the 
interview responses with the students actual academic record 
we got a lot of exaggeration but the exaggeration was much 
stronger in the facetoface situations than in the computerized or 
the paper and pencil situations nagao said 
nagao attributed this to people making socially desirable 
responses telling the interviewer what they think he or she wants 
to hear 
if you try to present yourself in a favorable way you will 
respond in a certain way he said 
when the pressure of trying to make a good impression on the 
interviewer was removed nagao said the applicants tended to be 
more honest 
nagao said there needs to be more study on the effectiveness of 
computers in job interviews but he said the findings of resentment 
show the need to pay attention to how the computers affect people 
employers perhaps should have a company representative talk to 
the job seeker immediately after the computer interview he said 
our point is to alert people that you cant just put a bank of 
pcs in a room and shuttle people through nagao said 
were not saying it computer interviewing is bad at all he 
said all we are saying is lets not get blindsided lets look 
at the social consequences and get away from the feeling that 
everything is hunkydory and you dont need to look beyond 
computer interview services sell their systems on the basis of 
consistency accountability and their ability to profile job 
applicants steve boyd vice president of human resource systems an 
atlantabased job interview service said the computer programs are 
especially popular with banks and retailers 
nagao and martin conducted their study by observing a group of 
students in simulated job interviews with a friendly interviewer a 
cold interviewer a paperandpencil application and a computer 
the researchers divided the test applicants among those seeking 
an entrylevel clerk job and those wanting a management trainee 
position the researchers observed how the applicants felt 
afterwards

interest rates are likely to stay high in canada 
despite their drop in the united states because of the canadian 
governments determination to control inflation economists here say 
i dont think theres much chance of their coming down marc 
meagher of merrill lynch canada said monday id be sort of 
inclined to look for more stability than any decline over the short 
term 
i dont think that recent months argue for any easing of 
interest rates added mark chandler of the royal bank of canada 
in a phone interview 
inflation rose in june to a 54 percent yearoveryear rate the 
highest level in more than five years after a 5 percent rate in 
may the same figure in june 1988 was 39 percent 
finance minister michael wilson said last week in paris that high 
inflation in canada leaves little room for loosening domestic 
monetary policy he said a different perception on inflation in 
the united states allows american officials more flexibility to ease 
monetary policy 
the bank of canada kept its rate at 1230 percent last week in 
the same range it has been since early june the rate is the minimum 
cost of shortterm financing to canadas chartered banks who have 
been offering most daytoday loans at 135 percent 
the prime rate in many us commercial banks has dropped as low 
as 105 percent that rate is charged to customers with the best 
credit ratings 
many analysts believe that the widening difference between 
canadian and us rates has contributed to the canadian dollars 
strength since spring attracting investors it has been trading in 
the range of 83 to 84 cents to the us dollar one or two cents 
higher than most forecasts had predicted 
as in the united states the canadian economy has expanded for 
seven years projections of a slowdown in the next year are 
widespread with some mention of a potential brief recession 
a survey of forecasts by the toronto globe and mails report on 
business earlier in july projected a fall to 29 percent in annual 
growth for 1989 and 15 percent next year down from the 45 percent 
increase in the gross domestic product that was registered in 1988 
strong growth however took place in the first quarter of 1989 
when real output rose at a 38 percent annual rate 
wilson said in june that the economys strong showing in the 
first part of the year indicated the bank of canadas high interest 
rate policy was justified 
the bank of canadas governor john crow has said repeatedly 
that keeping the lid on inflation is his top priority 
the increase in june inflation however was largely a result of 
higher federal and provincial taxes and seasonal food prices as 
such most canadian private sector analysts believe the figures 
would not prompt the government to push interest rates even higher 
the employment situation in canada also boosted the view that the 
government must hold off before declaring that the brakes on the 
economy have been applied sufficiently no drop in interest rates is 
expected until indications are clearer that the economy actually is 
slowing down 
in june unemployment fell to 73 percent which was its lowest 
since summer 1981

the commodity futures trading commission is 
curtailing its control over exotic investment products known as 
hybrids such as bonds linked to the price of oil or bank rates 
tied to the consumer price index 
hybrids are so named because they are financial instruments 
combining some aspects of commodity futures and options with the 
characteristics of debt securities such as bonds or bank deposits 
examples of these hybrid instruments include a bank deposit with 
its interest rate indexed to the exchange rate of the dollar and the 
japanese yen or a corporate note with its yield tied to the price 
of gold or oil 
new rules the cftc approved monday detailed the types of hybrids 
that will be exempt from its scrutiny including debt securities 
already regulated by the securities and exchange commission time 
deposits offered by a bank insured by the federal deposit insurance 
corp or instruments where the value of the option part has a 
premium of no more than 40 percent of the instruments issue price 
the hybrid issue has been controversial since 1987 when the the 
cftc which regulates futures and commodity options markets first 
proposed that such new investment instruments be regulated by the 
commission and traded only on organized exchanges 
but hybrid investment product issuers complained that such 
regulation would kill the development of a potential 
multibilliondollar market 
in january the commission voted 50 to remove some kinds of 
hybrid instruments from its control and formalized that vote monday 
thereby facilitating continued innovation and competition in these 
and related markets said cftc chairwoman wendy l gramm 
some have argued that the commission should not make any 
statements in these areas arguing that the regulatory uncertainty 
that exists was created by the commissions unwarranted assertion of 
jurisdiction this simply is not true said ms gramm in a 
statement 
regulatory uncertainty results because these innovative 
instruments by their very nature tend to cut across established 
regulatory and jurisdictional boundaries she said 
the cftc also voted to issue to a policy statement on the kinds 
of swap transactions it will not regulate because of jurisdictional 
limits 
interestrate and currency swaps are widely used to manage risks 
in world financial markets in a typical interestrate swap one 
party such as a bank strapped with by fixedrate customer loans 
exchanges its fixedrate debt for an equivalent amount of 
floatingrate debt to alter its interestrate exposure 
the international swap dealers association breathed a sigh of 
relief after an 18month debate with regulators over the issue 
isda chairman mark c brickell said us dealers were now free to 
develop swap options and commodity swaps of all types including 
swaps of physical commodities and financial indices this enables 
us dealers and endusers to play on a level field with their 
worldwide competitors 
the cftc criteria bar marketing a swap to the public and require 
that the swap be undertaken within the parties lines of business 
the commission said it will continue to review swaps that do not 
meet its criteria on a casebycase basis

market players avoided buying issues ahead of a release of us trade 
figures later today and a major national election in japan on sunday 
japanese market players have been very nervous about this 
election because we havent experienced anything this big 
recently he said 
although governing liberal democratic party leaders say they will 
win at least 54 seats of the 126 to be decided sunday analysts see 
that as a tough goal to reach 
the party has lost its popularity because of an 
influencepeddling stock scandal a new and unpopular sales tax and 
reports that prime minister sousuke uno kept paid mistresses 
the market has been inactive for an extended period because of 
fears that an election loss by the governing party would lead to a 
market plunge nomura said the market expects the us trade 
deficit will rise he added

million shares up from 230 million the previous day 
in currency dealings yenselling pressure remained strong since 
the dollars higher opening today but many market participants were 
reluctant to make major moves before the us trade report for may 
traders said 
the dollar was bought mainly by overseas investors said 
yoshitsugu hanada trader with mitsui bank 
it was largely because the g7 group of seven industrial 
nations meeting in paris didnt specify an appropriate range of the 
dollar he said becuase they just agreed only that the dollar 
should be stable against other key currencies it inspired 
dollarbuying hanada said 
japan wants the dollar to stay between 130140 yen he added 
finance minister tatsuo murayama told a press conference today 
that a slightly higher yen would be preferable 
a slightly stronger yen would make things easier from several 
points of view he said 
although us officials have indicated they are satisfied with 
the current level of the dollar murayama said he disagrees with 
that assessment

interior secretary manuel lujan jr is 
considering barring oil tankers from most ports and requiring them 
to unload at offshore super ports in an effort to prevent 
spills according to a published report 
lujans plan was outlined in a speech that he was delivering 
today in long beach the los angeles times reported 
the speech a copy of which was obtained in advance by the times 
also blasted efforts to place a congressional moratorium on offshore 
oil drilling and dismissed many environmental concerns against 
drilling as unfounded 
by imposing these moratoria lujan said the congress is 
saying that we should blindly reject even the possibilities before 
us burying our heads in the sands of our ignorance 
on the issue of barring tankers from most of the nations ports 
lujan said oil could be transported inland from the super ports 
by undersea pipelines 
such a super port is already in place off the louisiana coast 
and lujan said similar structures could greatly reduce the risks of 
oil spills in los angeles houston philadelphia and alaska 
lujan spoke strongly in favor of more offshore drilling 
including off the arctic national refuge a proposal that has come 
under fire since the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million 
gallons of oil off the coast of alaska last march 
the interior secretary said the nations energy needs set 
against its apparent hostility toward future oil exploration 
represent a time bomb waiting to explode 
the choice we face is not between oil or the environment he 
said it is a choice between utilizing our vast domestic energy 
resources in an environmentally sound manner or holding our nations 
energy hostage to a volatile and unpredictable world

the producer of country pride chicken has 
filed suit to keep from sharing its name with a brand of cow manure 
fertilizer 
conagra inc which produces country pridebrand chicken filed a 
lawsuit monday in federal court against earthgro inc which 
produces country pridebrand manure alleging the use of the name on 
fertilizer has hurt chicken sales 
besides cow manure the lebanon conn company sells country 
pride composted cow manure dehydrated cow manure potting soil top 
soil peat humus and sand 
the lawsuit says earthgro which owns a plant in avondale pa 
is deliberately misleading the public into associating country pride 
cow manure with country pride chicken the complaint accuses 
earthgro of infringing on conagras trademark and asks the court to 
prohibit the fertilizer company from using the country pride name 
timothy sellew coowner of the familyowned earthgro said 
monday conflicting trademarks lie at the root of the disagreement 
conagra received a federal trademark for the country pride name 
in 1975 but the government also granted earthgro the right to use 
the name six years later sellew said 
it sounds like one of those typical kind of things the big guy 
going after the little guy sellew said 
attorney john p passarelli who represents conagra said the 
situation was bound to create confusion 
we would simply not want our products associated with 
earthgros product passarelli said especially considering the 
nature of their product 
conagra based in omaha neb produces such brandname food 
products as banquet and morton in addition to country pride it had 
approximately 11 billion in sales last year

eight auto insurance companies who contend 
nevada lawmakers were seduced into passing a 15 percent auto 
insurance rate rollback law have challenged the newly mandated 
premium reductions as unconstitutional 
but a key lawmaker who led the drive for reduced auto insurance 
rates to july 1 1988 levels beginning this october said he had 
expected mondays suit and believes the new law can withstand the 
us district court challenge 
we knew it was coming said assemblyman gene porter dlas 
vegas who initially proposed a 20 percent rollback in auto 
insurance rates but the us government has had the power since 
the 1930s to limit how much a company can make what we did was 
constitutional 
we just cant drive them out of business 
porter said a clause was put into the bill that included the 15 
percent rollback to ensure companies wouldnt be forced to cut rates 
if they werent making a profit 
that clause was added following a california supreme court 
decision that said a 20 percent auto insurance rate rollback 
approved by voters in that states proposition 103 couldnt rob 
insurance companies of a fair rate of return or profit 
dave hill a spokesman for state farm mutual automobile insurance 
co one of the firms suing the state said that language in the law 
still lets the state make sure insurance companies are barely making 
a profit by unconstitutionally taking away a property right 
we say the legislators were politically seduced into approving 
this rollback because they thought people wanted it hill said 
but during hearings on the bill we showed them that almost none 
of the insurance companies operating in nevada were making any 
profits by offering auto insurance in fact most of the companies 
are losing money in that area we lost 3 million in 1988 there was 
no reason to pass this law in nevada 
hill criticized lawmakers for bypassing other insurance reform 
measures that could have lowered auto insurance premiums including 
one that would have limited damages for uninsured motorists 
another proposal would have given drivers a choice between 
regular liability insurance and nofault policies in which damages 
are paid no matter who is at fault in an accident but without 
costly litigation 
under the nofault policies however the right to sue for 
anything other than actual damages would have been restricted 
nevada insurance commissioner david gates who would have to 
approve any rate rollbacks under the law wasnt available for 
comment monday gates is named as the principal defendant in the 
suit 
the new law was signed july 6 by gov bob miller 
earlier gates said that it appeared very few if any insurance 
companies operating in nevada would be forced to roll back rates 
because the firms werent earning profits on their auto policies 
but he said the law requires every insurance company operating in 
nevada to justify its auto premium rates by refiling with his office 
the companies suing nevada include the largest instate 
operators state farm allstate and farmers along with national 
insurance co national mutual united services auto association 
safeco insurance and northland insurance co

time inc stock continued to fall amid the 
growing belief on wall street that paramount communications incs 
122 billion hostile bid for the media giant is doomed and that 
times own 14 billion offer for warner communications inc will 
prevail 
time stock fell 112 to 13987 a share in early new york 
stock exchange trading today after falling 425 monday and 475 on 
friday 
meanwhile warner stock transformed into a takeover issue by a 
delaware court ruling last week was up 37 cents to 6575 a share 
early today after rising 112 monday paramount stock which fell 
125 on monday slipped another 62 cents to 5562 a share today 
delaware chancery court judge william t allen ruled friday that 
time could proceed with its 70ashare offer for warner refusing 
paramounts request to block the deal paramount and some time 
shareholders are appealing the case but wall street expect the 
decision to stand when it reaches the delaware supreme court 
legal scholars agree 
the only basis they would have for reversing him allen 
would be on a quibbling over a factual determination said james 
d cox a law professor at duke university but history has borne 
out that hes rarely been overturned on factual questions 
i think the opinion is pretty set cox said although he said 
a reversal by the supreme court was not impossible 
john coffee a professor at the columbia university school of 
law said i think the odds are very very small that they will 
overturn allens ruling 
allen turned down paramounts request for an injunction against 
times tender offer for warner which paramount said would thwart 
its own 200ashare bid for time 
the judge disagreed with paramounts contention that times board 
had put the company up for sale in march when it agreed to a 
stockswap merger with warner therefore allen ruled the board did 
not have to seriously entertain paramounts unwanted offer 
however allen delayed times tender offer for warner which was 
scheduled to expire at midnight monday for 10 days to give 
paramount and the shareholders time to appeal 
time and warner amended their original stockforstock merger 
agreement to provide for the tender offer after paramount announced 
its bid last month 
the delaware supreme court will hear the case july 24 and could 
rule any time after both sides make their arguments 
peter appert an analyst with cj lawrencemorgan grenfell inc 
said that on wall street most people would be willing to assume 
that the timewarner transaction is a done deal 
appert said it did not seem likely allen would be overruled and 
most arbitragers the stock speculators who scooped up time stock 
after parmaount announced its bid are not willing to make that 
bet or make a big bet 
time announced monday it had extended its tender offer for warner 
until 5 pm july 24 in line with allens ruling delaying the 
expiration of the bid 
time is offering to pay 70 a share in cash for half of warners 
200 million outstanding shares and later exchange 70 in cash and 
securities for each of the remaining shares 
time said that as of noon friday about 147 million warner 
shares had been tendered many warner shareholders have been holding 
on to their stock pending the outcome of the court case

miners in western siberia will not end their 
crippling weeklong strike despite a pledge by politburo member 
nikolai slyunkov to increase food and consumer supplies a spokesman 
for the miners said today 
the work stoppage in the kuznetsk basin in western siberia has 
spread to the nations largest coal mining region the donetsk coal 
basin in the ukraine 
workers threw down their tools at two more mines in the donetsk 
where 15 shafts are idle a member of the strike committee said 
that job action began saturday but was not disclosed until monday 
slyunkov flew to the kuznetsk basin and met with the strikers 
monday night and today in an effort to resolve the walkout by more 
than 112000 miners there 
slyunkov addressed 30000 people at midday in the main square of 
prokopievsk 2100 miles east of moscow 
valery legachev a spokesman for the regional strike committee in 
siberia said slyunkov promised to increase food and consumer 
supplies but legachev said miners there were continuing their 
walkout because slyunkov was not specific 
in moscow the supreme soviet speeded up work on legislation on 
resolving labor conflicts 
the offical news agency tass carried a report denying that the 
thirdlargest coal region karaganda in kazakhstan was also on 
strike 
in the first kremlin comment on the strike premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov said monday that it threatened production at some 
metallurgical and power plants 
weekend press reports said coal production had been cut by 1 
million tons and a coal shortage had interrupted work at the 
magnitka steel complex in the ural mountains 
in meetings with strikers slyunkov promised higher pay for night 
work longer vacations and a doubling of the wholesale price of 
coal the government newspaper izvestia reported in todays editions 
but the strike committee spokesman said the promises lacked 
substance and the miners would stay out until all their demands were 
met 
we are determined to go on with the strike because they 
received no concrete documented response to their demands 
legachev said there were only general statements 
he promised to increase the areas regular food supplies by 20 
to 30 percent as well as soap and washing powder legachev said 
the miners from prokopievsk and eight other towns in the kuznetz 
basin are demanding greater economic autonomy from the moscowbased 
coal mining ministry 
in makeyevka in the donetsk region strike committee leader 
vladimir komissaruk said the strike spread today to two more mines 
it is like a chain reaction komissaruk said in a telephone 
interview from strike committee headquarters 
miners in the donetsk basin or donbass are demanding a 40 
percent wage increase for night work improved living conditions a 
fixed day off and retirement after 20 years of underground work 
they also demanded that the mining ministry trim its managerial 
staff 
no law deals with industrial strikes which were suppressed in 
the soviet union before the reforms launched by president mikhail s 
gorbachev four years ago 
underground journals have described work stoppages that were far 
shorter and not as widespread as the coal strike which appeared to 
be the worst labor unrest in the soviet union since the turbulence 
of the 1920s 
a draft law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is being 
pushed through the supreme soviet legislature tass said today 
the draft was being studied by the committee on legislation 
legality and law and order which received the proposed legislation 
monday tass said 
their opinion is that the draft will furnish a legal basis for 
a resolution of labor conflicts including the current largescale 
coal miners strike tass said

the bush administration predicted today that 
economic growth will be slower and interest rates higher than in its 
earlier projections 
however it said the federal budget deficit would be lower this 
year than had been expected and that congress can meet next years 
deficitreduction targets if it sticks to its promises 
we believe the economy is healthy and we believe growth will 
continue but at a somewhat slower pace treasury secretary 
nicholas brady said at a news briefing 
although the administration prediction of 27 percent growth this 
year and 26 percent next year was still more optimistic than many 
other forecasters including the congressional budget office brady 
said it was realistic 
the administration remains confident of the future course of 
the us economy said michael boskin chairman of the presidents 
council of economic advisers 
white house budget director richard darman announced that the 
federal deficit in the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 is 
now projected at 1483 billion down sharply from the 164 billion 
the administration was predicting in february 
a 13 billion increase in expected tax receipts accounts for most 
of the drop 
for the 1990 fiscal year starting oct 1 however darman warned 
congress that it will violate the constraints of the grammrudman 
law unless it more carefully carries out the deficitreduction 
agreement lawmakers struck with the white house earlier this year 
if the agreement were fully implemented darman said the fiscal 
1990 deficit would drop to about 992 billion just below the 100 
billion goal contained in grammrudman that figure includes 57 
billion from selling federal assets revenue that does not count 
toward grammrudman calculations 
however darman said the current congressional pattern appears 
headed toward a deficit of 1105 billion more than 10 billion 
above the grammrudman target and high enough to trigger automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts under the law 
the congress is cutting it very very close he said 
in january the white house projected that the economy would grow 
by 35 percent this year compared with the new forecast of 27 
percent for 1990 the growth in the gross national product is 
expected to be 26 percent compared with 34 percent predicted in 
february 
the administration predicted today that 91day treasury bill 
rates will average 8 percent this year and 67 percent next year 
that compares with earlier predictions of 74 percent and 55 
percent respectively 
boskin said the administration expected inflation to moderate in 
the second half of 1989 based on a prediction that the oil and food 
price increases of earlier this year will end 
many outside economists and the congressional budget office 
considered the administrations earlier projections to be optimistic 
preliminary 1990 projections sent to congress earlier this month 
by cbo are more pessimistic than the white house with economic 
growth of 17 percent and 90day interest rates of about 72 percent 
the healthier the economy the lower the federal deficit can be 
expected to be that is because when the economy is performing well 
the government collects more taxes pays fewer social benefits to 
people out of work and pays lower interest rates on the money it 
borrows 
the fiscal 1990 budget approved by congress in may was written 
one month after congressional leaders and bush administration 
officials reached a deal claiming to reduce next years deficit to 
994 billion 
many of the savings such as no longer counting the postal 
services expected 2 billion in losses for next year in budget 
calculations have been criticized as illusory

nationwide strikes by hundreds of thousands of 
employees today shut down the train system the london subway 37 
ports and city libraries and daycare centers 
the stoppages are part of a wave of union militancy confronting 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government as it 
tries to halt inflation topping 8 percent 
the rail and subway strike is the fifth joint 24hour stoppage in 
five weeks hopes were raised monday that the rail strike could be 
averted when a second british rail union accepted an 88 percent 
wage increase 
the 17500member train crews union the associated society of 
locomotive engineers and firemen accepted the offer and called off 
its ban on working overtime and days off 
however the third and biggest union the national union of 
railwaymen rejected it late monday night holding out for a 
10percent raise for its 75000 members 
the unions general secretary jimmy knapp told reporters the 
offer was simply not enough 
rail workers are among britains lowest paid industrial 
employees with average earnings including overtime of 471 a week 
for drivers and 325 for the rest 
transport minister paul channon called the decision 
irresponsible 
i think people will be utterly astonished and totally fed up 
he said 
mrs thatcher came to office 10 years ago declaring that the 
battle against inflation was her prime economic aim but the annual 
inflation rate at 83 percent against 49 percent a year ago is 
the highest in the 12nation european economic community 
the 10500 striking london subway workers are also among the 
lowest paid industrial staff they want a 102 weekly pay raise to 
operate subway trains without conductors 
management has offered 48 plus extra vacation but is demanding 
increased production 
the national association of port employers said an indefinite 
strike that began among 9400 dockworkers at 60 ports around britain 
on july 10 is crumbling the associations spokesman iain dale said 
that just 37 of the 60 ports are now halted and that the other 23 
are working normally 
the dockworkers are striking over he governments abolition at 
the 60 ports of a legally enforced scheme dating back to 1947 that 
guaranteed them work britains other 102 ports are unaffected by 
the strike 
also on strike were more than 500000 members of the national and 
local government officers association halting municipal services 
across the country 
the workers earn an average of about 16000 a year they want a 
12 percent pay raise their employers have offered 7 percent

congressional negotiators today narrowed the 
issues separating them on a bailout plan for the savings and loan 
industry to junk bonds who will regulate 1200 statechartered sampls 
and how will the rescue be financed 
we are prepared to move a very substantial distance toward the 
positions you insist on house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas told sens donald riegle dmich jake garn 
rutah and alan cranston dcalif 
the house conferees had agreed among themselves wednesday to bow 
to senate demands giving regulators more control over the activities 
sampls can engage in and ability to suspend under certain conditions 
federal insurance coverage of insolvent institutions 
gonzalez today presented to the senate negotiators the houses 
broad counterproposal to a senate plan last week that bowed to 
tougher house language on making sampl owners put more of their own 
money at risk and making the industry pay for new lowincome housing 
initiatives 
it looks to me to be a very constructive proposal said 
riegle who as chairman of the senate banking committee is the chief 
senate negotiator in the bargaining 
garn said he still opposes house demands that sampls disinvest in 
junk bonds within two years and that the federal deposit insurance 
corp rather than the treasury department be put in charge of 
regulating statechartered but federally insured thrifts 
i cant find a single institution that has failed because of 
junk bonds garn said contending the house language would cause 
considerable losses because a fire sale of junk bonds would 
lower the price that sampls could command for them to 60 cents or 70 
cents on the dollar 
but he raised no initial objection to making m danny wall his 
former aide and now the governments chief sampl regulator face new 
confirmation hearings in order to keep his job as the house is 
demanding 
with sampl losses mounting at a rate of 10 million to 12 million 
a day the cost of the bailout already has mushroomed by 5 billion 
since bush outlined his proposal last february the cost of the 
biggest financial rescue since the depression is estimated at 157 
billion 
the process was slowed last week when senate conferees presented 
a comprehensive package adopting most of the houses tougher capital 
requirements on sampls and accepting its demand for new 
industryfinanced housing subsidies 
the house conferees said monday they would offer to require that 
wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board and william l 
seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp face new 
confirmation hearings 
bush appointed seidman to take over management of the crisis from 
wall last february when he proposed the rescue legislation to cover 
some 100 billion in industry losses of governmentinsured sampl 
deposits 
however the president also proposed making wall head of the new 
office of thrift supervision in the treasury department that is to 
replace the home loan bank board as the industrys chief regulator 
although seidman is widely praised as the best official available 
to untangle the sampl mess the chief of the house negotiators 
gonzalez proposed monday that seidman and wall face new confirmation 
trials 
in this way the performance of both the fdic and bank board 
incumbent would be subject to review and certainly parallel 
treatment is fair said gonzalez 
as chairman of the house banking committee gonzalez has blamed 
wall as a major contributor to the escalation of the sampl crisis by 
underestimating its magnitude in 1987 and 1988 
wall however has support from garn the ranking republican on 
the senate banking committee wall was director of the senate 
committees staff from 1981 through 1986 when garn was its chairman 
and his wife is now the senators personal secretary 
house negotiators rejected the senates proposal to put 
statechartered thrifts which have been blamed for a large part of 
the crisis under the regulation of the new office that wall might 
assume 
instead they insisted monday that seidman be put in control of 
statechartered sampls while the new treasury office assumes 
responsibility for regulating federally chartered thrifts 
the house conferees also agreed monday to adopt tougher senate 
language restricting business activities of statechartered thrifts 
and giving the fdic authority to suspend deposit insurance if an sampl 
has no tangible capital 
but they could not agree on how to reconcile the way junk bonds 
are treated the house wants to make sampls dispose of all junk bonds 
within two years the senate last week proposed cutting how much of 
an sampls deposits can be invested in the highyield securities from 
the 11 percent now allowed to 6 percent 
the biggest issue still dividing the two sides is over financing 
the immediate 50 billion needed to pay off depositors in failed 
institutions 
bush and the senate would do it through 30year private bonds to 
avoid swelling the federal deficit while the house would have the 
treasury borrow the money directly but exempt it from grammrudman 
deficitreduction targets

the us trade deficit widened dramatically in 
may to 1024 billion the biggest imbalance in five months as 
americas appetite for foreign goods rebounded sharply the 
government said today 
the commerce department said the may deficit figure represented a 
236 percent increase from a revised imbalance of 829 billion in 
april when the nation registered the lowest monthly trade gap in 
more than four years 
the deterioration in may reflected a sharp 43 percent increase 
in imports to a new high of 4071 billion and a 09 percent drop in 
sales of us goods abroad analysts had been expecting the deficit 
to widen in may but only to about 9 billion 
mays trade gap was the biggest since a 108 billion deficit 
recorded last december 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the may figure was 
disappointing but he added that we are encouraged by the 
continuing strength of exports 
exports while off slightly in may continued at near record 
levels of over 30 billion for the third month in a row mosbacher 
said this is an encouraging trend and reflects continued success 
by american companies in expanding foreign markets 
economist michael evans head of a washington consulting firm 
said the increase in may was partly a bounceback from an 
artificially low number in april but he said the monthly trade 
deficits are likely to rise gradually for the rest of the year 
i wouldnt say this was a fluke or that its going to get 
better again evans said i think its a harbinger of things to 
come 
even with the spurt in may the trade gap for the first five 
months of the year was running at an annual rate of 1111 billion 
below the actual 1988 deficit of 11853 billion 
last years figure represented a dramatic 221 percent 
improvement over 1987 when the trade deficit hit an alltime high 
of 15212 billion and accounted for almost half of all us 
economic growth in 1988 
analysts have been predicting the slowing of the us economy 
could help hold down this years deficit by curbing domestic demand 
for imports but they also warn that the recent strength of the us 
dollar against foreign currencies could stunt further progress on 
the trade gap 
in may imports reached a new high as increases were recorded in 
virtually every major category except autos imports of agricultural 
products jumped 107 percent 
petroleum imports shot up 173 percent to 475 billion as the 
price of a barrel of oil rose to 1840 up from 1783 in april 
the volume of oil imports also rose in may reaching 833 million 
barrels a day up from 757 million a day in april 
us exports meanwhile fell to a seasonally adjusted 3047 
billion in may as sales declined in most major categories exports 
of consumer goods dropped 57 percent 
as usual the united states posted its largest trade deficit in 
may with japan a 428 billion shortfall that was up from 389 
billion in april 
the nation posted a small 783 million trade deficit with 
western europe after posting surpluses in both march and april 
the imbalance with canada the largest us trading partner was 
7393 million in may up from 1748 million in april 
other large deficits in may were recorded with taiwan 109 
billion south korea 503 million and mexico 452 million 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said in advance of todays report that if the slowing of 
us economic growth continues the trend would be toward 
narrowing the trade deficit 
however dederick cautioned that gains on the trade front could 
be held back by the stronger dollar which would make it more 
difficult for american manufacturers to competitively market their 
products to other industrial nations 
the foreign markets are there and expanding dederick said 
the question is whether we given the strength of the dollar will 
be able to maintain our share 
the bush administration meanwhile is trying to strengthen 
exports and spur economic growth at home by aggressively pushing 
foreign countries to open their markets to more us goods 
at the justconcluded economic summit in paris leaders of the 
worlds seven most powerful democracies said that while progress had 
been made in reducing imbalances in world trade the momentum of 
adjustment has recently weakened markedly 
in their final communique the leaders pledged action to bring 
down the trade deficits in the united states canada and italy at 
the same time they urged west germany and japan to take steps to 
boost consumer demand for imports and thus help reduce their 
partners trade deficits 
the leaders warned that trade protectionism remains a real 
threat we strongly reaffirm our determination to fight it in all 
its forms

grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly 
lower today on the chicago board of trade 
analysts said the heavy rains soaking iowa and parts of the upper 
midwest weighed heavily on corn prices at the opening bell and 
soybeans started trending lower in sympathy 
november soybeans flirted with the contract low set about a month 
ago and prospects for improvement were not good a wave of selling 
is expected as traders move to comply with last weeks bot emergency 
order requiring market players to reduce their positions in the july 
contract to 3 million bushels by the close of trading today 
the order widely interpreted as the exchanges reaction to the 
large soybean position built by italian agribusiness giant ferruzzi 
spa calls for traders to be down to 1 million bushels when the july 
contract goes off the board thursday 
only wheat managed to escape the price deluge early and traders 
said if corn and beans continue sliding wheat prices likely will 
give way as well 
on the open wheat was cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 387 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 9 cents lower with july at 242 a bushel oats were 2 cent

merabank officials said tuesday they would lay off 
an unspecified number of employees sell three subsidiaries and 
repossessed real estate and make changes in loan policy as part of a 
financial turnaround plan for the moneylosing thrift 
we will accelerate the streamlining of operations return to 
the basic business of a federally insured depository of savings 
accounts and become a major buyer of highquality lowrisk home 
mortgages in the future merabank chairman gene rice said in a 
prepared statement 
merabank lost 209 million in 1988 and 29 million in the first 
quarter of this year and a 13000member group of stockholders of 
its parent company pinnacle west capital corp urged last month 
that merabank be spun off 
pinnacle west also owns phoenixbased arizona public service co 
the states largest electric utility 
included in the phoenixbased thrifts costcutting measures is 
the layoff of an unspecified number of employees over fiveyear 
period rices statement said he said the layoffs reflect the 
economic condition of the marketplace 
mesa radio station kfnn said it was told by rice that merabank 
was laying off 160 people including 150 in arizona and 10 in texas 
merabank plans to sell three subsiduaries sacramento 
califbased fia associates inc which buys and manages real estate 
for pension funds merateach inc a data processing service company 
in dallas and phoenix and meracor insurance corp a phoenix 
insurance agency 
rice also said merabank plans to sell off repossessed real estate 
in an orderly manner 
while the plan is expected to reduce annual overhead to 80 
million from 148 million within five years merabank still expects 
to continue to lose money because of nonperforming loans until the 
real estate market recovers rice said 
under the new plan merabank will only make loans secured by 
savings he said 
new applications will not be taken for residential commercial 
construction real estate or consumer loans rice said 
federal regulators are demanding that pinnacle west pump an 
additional 180 million into merabank to guarantee against 
insolvency and the arizona corporation commission last wednesday 
temporarily capped what aps can pay out in dividends to pinnacle 
west 
the commission acted even though pinnacle west and aps executives 
had promised that aps would not be raided for money needed by 
merabank 
on june 29 pinnacle west announced it and merabank had formed 
committees of their boards of directors to negotiate with regulators 
and to study restructuring options that include possible disposition 
of merabank 
pinnacle west bought merabank in december 1986 for 426 million

wheat futures closed higher soybeans were mixed 
and corn fell sharply tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
as in mondays market weather was at center stage in all three 
pits 
because corn is in its most critical growing stage heavy rains 
in the corn belt were viewed as favorable to crop production and 
prices in that pit opened under pressure and were lower all day 
wheat however was bolstered by forecasts for drier weather in 
the plains states and betterthanexpected export business and 
managed to stay on the upside through most of the session 
soybeans started the day lower in sympathy with the losses in 
corn but large buying by several commercial brokers enabled 
oldmonth soybeans to rebound in light volume 
november soybeans flirted with a contract low set last month but 
there was less selling than expected tuesday in light of a bot 
emergency order last week requiring market players to reduce their 
positions in the july contract to 3 million bushels by the close of 
trading 
the order widely interpreted as the exchanges reaction to the 
large soybean position built by italian agribusiness giant ferruzzi 
spa calls for traders to be down to 1 million bushels when the 
july contract goes off the board thursday 
on the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 387 a bushel corn was cent to 
6 cents lower with july at 247 a bushel oats were cent to 3 
cents higher with september at 142 a bushel and soybeans were 9 
cents lower to 19 cents higher with july at 697 a bushel

the dollar lost value against most major 
currencies in us dealings that were hectic at times tuesday as 
traders reacted to an unexpectedly poor report on the us trade 
performance 
earlier on foreign exchange markets abroad the dollar finished 
mixed 
gold prices moved modestly higher at home after a mixed showing 
overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery rose 160 to 37260 a troy ounce republic national bank 
of new york quoted a bid of 37190 for an ounce of bullion at 4 
pm edt up 160 from mondays late bid 
simon fischer a vice president at bear stearns amp co said 
currency trading was brisk immediately after the commerce department 
reported the countrys merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to 
a seasonally adjusted 1024 billion in may from 829 billion in 
april 
it had been widely predicted that the may deficit would be around 
9 billion 
news in the report that imports grew 43 percent to a record 
4071 billion in may implied that the us economy remains strong 
because it is drawing in vast quantities of foreign goods 
this point fed bullish sentiment toward the dollar because it 
suggested that the federal reserve board might be less inclined to 
drive down interest rates high us interest rates have supported 
the dollar by making earnings on dollardenominated investments 
attractive 
tempering the bullishness was speculation that the bush 
administration might favor a lower dollar and wish to promote its 
decline through interest rate manipulation to help bring the trade 
deficit down 
trading volume dwindled as the day went by with the dollar 
finishing lower against most currencies except the japanese yen and 
the canadian dollar 
fischer said in the afternoon traders started to even out their 
currency holdings so they might be able to make profits wednesday no 
matter which way the dollar moves in response to the consumer price 
index report for june 
before the trade report was released the dollar had strengthened 
in tokyo to close at 14235 japanese yen up from 14153 yen late 
monday later in london the dollar traded at 14170 yen and in 
new york the dollar closed at 14150 yen up slightly from 14143 
yen on monday 
the british pound strengthened against the dollar in london one 
pound cost 16255 late tuesday compared to mondays 16075 
sterling fetched 16235 in new york vs 16150 on monday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late mondays 
rates included 18960 west german marks down from 19030 16430 
swiss francs down from 16445 64325 french francs down from

oil prices fell tuesday weakened by trader 
expectations of more crude and gasoline supplies reaching the market 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for west 
texas intermediate crude the benchmark grade of oil fell 11 cents 
a barrel to 2034 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale unleaded 
gasoline for august delivery fell 102 cent a gallon to 5606 cents 
and wholesale homeheating oil for august delivery fell 005 cent a 
gallon to 5050 cents 
andrew lebow a broker at the new york energy futures firm 
edampf man international futures inc attributed the weakness 
partly to high gasoline production which has led to a surplus along 
the east coast and gulf coast 
i think whats happened is that refiners have been able to 
produce much more gasoline than many analysts had figured lebow 
said wholesale gasoline prices now have dropped by about 23 cents a 
gallon from the spring high 
others said the market weakness reflected anticipation that the 
american petroleum institutes weekly statistical report would 
continue to show a big growth in supplies of oil and refined 
products

international business machines corp on tuesday announced a 39 
percent quarterly profit increase that was swollen by a onetime 
factor while apple computer inc reported a smallerthanexpected 
53 percent gain 
ibms report fell within expectations and the stock slid back 
125 to 11475 in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
erasing its 125 gain from monday apple took a bigger hit sliding 
150 to 3925 in late overthecounter dealings 
the secondquarter profit increase at ibm was unusually large 
because results a year ago had been depressed by a onetime 600 
million charge to cover the cost of cuts in manufacturing and 
headquarters operations 
excluding that charge earnings per share would have risen about 
31 percent 
analysts said they were impressed by ibms revenue growth which 
appeared to be in double digits both overseas and in the united 
states where sales had been weak the company said sales were 
growing across its product line from personal computers to 
mainframes 
ibm chairman john f akers has been moving employees into sales 
and marketing jobs since 1987 which the company declared the year 
of the customer 
these are the first measurable results of the backtothefield 
move said bob djurdjevic an analyst at annex research inc in 
phoenix 
armonk nybased ibm said it earned 134 billion in the 
quarter or 231 a share in comparison with earnings of 964 
million or 163 a share a year earlier revenue rose 94 percent 
to 152 billion from 139 billion 
for the first six months of the year ibm said its earnings rose 
35 percent to 229 billion or 392 a share from 221 billion 
or 373 a share a year earlier revenue rose 76 percent to 279 
billion from 26 billion 
apples results disappointed investors sales of most products 
except the macintosh iicx and macintosh se30 are sluggish and the 
company continues to hire resulting in a squeeze between costs and 
revenue said john mcmanus an analyst at thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york 
theyre losing some momentum in the marketplace and that 
concerns me he said 
the cupertino califbased personal computer maker said earnings 
in its third fiscal quarter ended june 30 rose to 961 million or 
74 cents a share from 913 million or 71 cents a share a year 
earlier revenue rose to 125 billion from 993 million a year 
earlier 
for the first nine months apple said its earnings rose less than 
1 percent to 293 million or 228 a share from 292 million or 
224 a share a year earlier revenue rose to 39 billion from 
29 billion 
apple said it continued to be hurt by higher component costs 
especially for memory chips which it bought when they were at their 
highest price

audi of americas fullpage ads in dozens of 
newspapers tuesday triumphantly declared case closed on its 
problems with sudden acceleration but an attorney notes that a 
related class action suit against the automaker remains wide open 
these guys have a lot of nerve said robert f lisco of 
chicago who represents plaintiffs in a suit covering up to 300000 
audi 5000 owners seeking damages for lost resale value blamed on 
sudden acceleration concerns the case is not closed 
the ads ran nationally in the wall street journal and usa today 
and in local newspapers serving the 34 top markets said audi 
spokesman joe bennett in troy mich 
they note the national highway traffic safety administration on 
july 11 officially completed its investigation of sudden accleration 
involving the audi 5000 and determined the problem did not involve a 
mechanical or electrical defect 
the agency which in january 1987 noted 1750 reports of alleged 
sudden acceleration resulting in 1269 accidents 430 injuries and 
nine deaths said the major cause of the problem appears to have 
been drivers unknowingly stepping on the accelerator instead of the 
brake pedal 
audis ad asks is there anyone who has not heard the rumors of 
sudden acceleration in audi we doubt it 
after sketching the nhtsa findings it closes with the words 
audi has been vindicated case closed 
bennett agreed that the suit pending in cook county circuit court 
theoretically involves people around the country it covers 
about 300000 current and former us owners of audi 5000 sedans 
model years 19781986 but said the clearly were not about the 
court case 
this is the only city in america where there could have been 
any thought we were talking about that case and anybody who read 
the ad would know thats not what were taking about bennett 
said we were talking about the larger issue and not just the 
chicago issue 
in august 1988 a judge rejected audis offer to give the 
plaintiffs credits of between 300 and 2000 toward purchase of a 
new vehicle the judge noted plaintiffs only would benefit if they 
bought another audi 
audi decided to drop negotiations and go to trial bennett said 
the company did not expect any action on the trial before late 
summer or fall 
lisco said plaintiffs attorneys have asked the judge to apply a 
finding by a new jersey appellate court which affirmed a 100000 
judgment for punitive damages against audi because of a design 
defect allegedly linked to sudden acceleration 
at issue was the location of the gas and the brake pedal so 
close to one another that a driver might inadvertently place their 
foot on the accelerator thinking theyre applying it to the brake 
lisco said 
bennett rejected characterization of the pedal placement as a 
design defect 
the nthsa found that audi recall campaigns to modify the pedals 
on 1978 through 1983 models install automatic shiftlock mechanisms 
on all models and correct idlespeed controls in 1984 through 1986 
models appear to have resulted in a very substantial reduction of 
the number of sudden acceleration incidents and accidents 
bennett said the shift lock reduced the complaint level by over 
90 percent about the west germanmade cars distributed by 
volkswagen of america

company officials said tuesday a 
multibilliondollar agreement for dow chemical co to acquire a 
majority stake in marion laboratories inc will give dow the solid 
position in pharmaceuticals it wants and give marion the new 
products it needs 
under the agreement signed late monday dow chemical plans to 
merge its subsidiary merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc of 
cincinnati with marion the new company called marion merrell dow 
inc will be based in kansas city 
the deal will create a new global pharmaceutical company with 
worldwide annual sales of about 23 billion said fred w lyons 
jr president and chief executive officer of marion who will 
become president of the new company 
weve become a major player right now lyons said 
joseph g temple jr executive vice president of dow and 
chairman and chief executive officer of merrell dow will become 
chairman and ceo for two to three years before retiring 
the new company will have 1500 sales representatives in the 
united states and a significant marketing presence in foreign 
markets lyons said 
dow merrell and marion both are growing rapidly but the slightly 
larger dow merrell has concentrated on basic research while marion 
specializes in licensing other companies compounds developing 
medical uses for them and then marketing the new drugs dow has a 
much bigger overseas presence 
its really a perfect fit lyons said 
both dow merrell and marion had been searching for possible 
business partners for several months lyons said and began talking 
two months ago 
for dow merrells corporate parent the deal satisfies a desire 
to diversify and expand its pharmaceutical interests to protect 
itself from the cyclical swings in chemicals and plastics analysts 
said 
dow has been trying to get out of the commodity chemical 
business into something thats more valueadded said steven 
bernard an analyst with edward d jones amp co in st louis 
marions sales exploded in the early 1980s thanks to the drug 
cardizem but the company had no significant new products under 
development to compensate for increasing competition in 1992 when 
companies can begin producing generic varieties of cardizem 
we didnt think the glory days would come back unless they came 
up with a new product said jon braatz an analyst with bc 
christopher securities co in kansas city 
besides cardizem which is used to treat angina and high blood 
pressure marions main product is the antiulcer drug carafate 
merrell dows main products are the antihistamine seldane an 
anticholesterol drug lorelco the antismoking gum nicorette and 
cepacol a mouthwash 
in the first step of the twostage deal dow will buy 39 percent 
of marions 150 million outstanding shares at 38 each or about 22 
billion 
later the big chemical company will acquire about 28 percent 
more of marions stock giving dow a 67 percent interest in marion 
by 1991 or 1992 
dow plans to pay for the newly issued shares by turning merrell 
dow over to marion and issuing a new class of securities that 
provide for payments by dow to marion shareholders based on marions 
stock price at the time 
ewing kauffman who founded marion in his kansas city garage in 
1950 and his family support the transaction the family will tender 
their shares to dow lyons said the kauffmans now control 23 
percent of marion stock they would be able to sell only the same 
portion of their shares as other marion shareholders or 39 percent 
the marionmerrell dow merger is the latest in a series of recent 
consolidations in the drug business among the major recent deals 
are smithkline beckman corps planned merger with beecham group 
plc of britain american home products corps planned acquisition 
of ah robins co and the purchase of sterling drug inc by

soybean futures closed mixed tuesday on the chicago board of 
trade as the first of two deadlines requiring traders to reduce 
large positions in the july contract passed without fanfare 
on other markets copper extended its rally on renewed fears of 
terrorist action against mines in peru and papua new guinea but the 
precious metals failed to shake recent doldrums despite a sharp 
decline by the dollar 
petroleum futures were mixed and livestock and cattle futures 
were lower 
just as it had monday weather again took over center stage in 
the grain and soybean pits 
because corn is in its most critical growing stage heavy rains 
in the corn belt were viewed as favorable to crop production and 
prices in that pit opened under pressure and held to the downside 
all day 
wheat however was bolstered by forecasts for drier weather in 
the plains states and betterthanexpected export business and 
managed to stay on the upside through most of the session 
soybeans started the day lower in sympathy with the losses in 
corn but several large buys by commercial brokers helped hold the 
line and enabled the july and august contracts to rebound 
with soybean supplies expected to remain tight for the near term 
both months held their gains while contracts for the back months 
closed lower 
traders said overall that there was less selling than might 
have been expected tuesday in light of a bot emergency order last 
week requiring traders to reduce their positions in the july 
contract to 3 million bushels by the close of trading 
the order widely interpreted as the exchanges reaction to the 
large soybean position built by italian agribusiness giant ferruzzi 
spa calls for traders to be down to 1 million bushels when the 
july contract goes off the board thursday 
ferruzzi said it had accumulated contracts for delivery of as 
much as 24 million bushels of soybeans to meet export business 
commitments and ensure a steady flow of product for its processing 
plants others have suggested the company sought to corner the 
soybean market 
supply tightness aside there are two reasons the closing 
prices were interesting said a trader who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity the first is that the volume in july beans was very 
thin because nobody wants to get involved that might explain the 
healthy price climb there 
as for august he added ferruzzi may simply have rolled 
their july contracts into the next month 
wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 387 a bushel corn was 6 cents lower to 
cents higher with july at 248 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 3 
cents higher with september at 142 a bushel and soybeans were 9 
cents lower to 18 cents higher with july at 695 a bushel 
july and august traditionally are the months of slowest 
industrial demand for copper but the september contract picked up 
50 cent a pound monday on reports of trouble in peru and rocketed 
ahead 38 cents tuesday 
fueling the price climb was news of a strike by workers at a 
copper mine in british columbia canada and reports that the state 
of emergency declared by the government of papua new guinea set to 
end in midaugust when operations at the bougainville mine were to 
resume will be extended through midseptember 
also helping move prices were reports that shining path guerillas 
in peru who have caused disruptions at the lead zinc and silver 
mining operations of centromin the stateowned company would 
include copper mines in future actions 
the supply picture has been bullish for some time but the 
demand is not there for much of the summer said bette raptopolous 
of prudentialbache securities inc new york the threat of 
terrorist activity gave it a lot more immediacy 
copper settled 2 cents to 38 cents higher on the comex with 
july at 1098 cents a pound 
precious metals didnt fare quite as well 
gold also traded on the comex climbed 160 to 190 with july 
at 37260 a troy ounce silver was 19 cents to 21 cents lower 
with july at 5242 cents a pound platinum traded on the new york 
mercantile exchange settled 430 to 450 lower with july at 
50420 a troy ounce 
petroleum futures were mixed to mostly lower 
crude oil settled 11 cents to 32 cents lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange with august at 2034 a barrel heating oil was 
26 lower to 07 cent higher with august at 5050 cents a gallon 
and unleaded gasoline was 20 cent to 102 cents lower with august 
at 5606 cents a gallon 
livestock and cattle futures were mostly lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle were unchanged to 32 cent lower with august at 
7280 cents a pound feeder cattle were 45 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with august at 8355 cents a pound live hogs were 18 cent 
to 60 cent lower with july at 4747 cents a pound and frozen pork 
bellies were 75 cent to 11 cents lower with july at 2827 cents a

driverside air bags will be standard in 13 
models of general motors corps 1990 cars costing the automaker at 
least 500 per car the companys president said tuesday 
robert stempel refused to disclose what the device would cost 
consumers but said the company has spent nearly 1 billion in 
research design development and labor costs 
the cost per car could drop if consumers want the air bags on 
more models 
the federal government requires all cars made in the united 
states after sept 1 to have a passive restraint system for 
frontseat riders that could involve air bags or automatic seat 
belts 
an exemption in the law allows automakers who put air bags on the 
drivers side to equip the passengers side with a manual 
lapandshoulder belt system until sept 1 1993 
all of chrysler corps usmade cars for the 1990 model year 
which makes up 90 percent of its automobile fleet will have 
driverside air bags and manual lapshoulder belts as standard 
equipment 
chrysler spokesman ben dunn declined to say what the system would 
cost prices for 1990 cars have not been released 
ford motor co has said about 1 million of its 1990 model cars 
or about half of its car fleet will have driverside air bags they 
will be standard equipment in the ford mustang taurus and crown 
victoria the mercury sable grand marquis the lincoln town car 
continental and mark vii and the merkur scorpio 
they will be offered as options on the ford tempo and the mercury 
topaz 
spokeswoman joy stinson declined to say what air bags would cost 
and said they are not included as a separate option but as part of 
a package of extra features 
auto industry observers expect higher prices for 1990 cars 
partly because of the passiverestraint law 
its an expensive system stempel said he estimated that a 
consumer could pay about 1000 to replace an airbag system used in 
an accident 
gms system inflates when the car is involved in a frontend 
wreck as strong as slamming into a barrier at 14 mph or more the 
bag carried in the center of the steering wheel inflates in 130th 
of a second or three times faster than the blink of an eye it 
deflates slowly 
driverside air bags will be optional in the oldsmobile 88 royale 
and 98 regency in the past the airbag option in those cars has 
cost 850 
the company said about 500000 1990 cars or less than 15 percent 
of gms car fleet would have the systems as standard equipment 
included are 
buick reatta and riviera 
cadillac allante deville eldorado fleetwood and seville 
chevrolet camaro and corvette 
geo metro convertible later in the model year and storm 
oldsmobile toronado 
pontiac firebird 
all other gm cars will have automatic seat belts for frontseat

gov michael s dukakis moving to 
protect massachusetts companies and workers against corporate 
raiders signed legislation tuesday to hinder debtfinanced 
takeovers 
the law received support from a number of business and labor 
groups in massachusetts but has been attacked by some investors and 
securities specialists as an effort to entrench corporate managers 
modeled after a delaware statute the law will freeze a target 
companys assets for three years unless the buyer either is approved 
by the companys board or obtains 90 percent of the stock not 
controlled by management 
dukakis signed the bill at the cambridge headquarters of polaroid 
corp the instant camera and film company which earlier this year 
used the delaware law to fend off a hostile bid from a group led by 
roy disney heir to the disney entertainment fortune polaroid is 
incorporated in delaware 
state officials said the law was prompted by recent takeover 
battles for polaroid and other massachusetts companies including 
gillette prime computer and dunkin donuts that the dukakis 
administration views as a threat to the states economic vitality 
more than 20 states have antitakeover statutes but the 
massachusetts law is among the most comprehensive containing 
provisions to protect labor as well as management said stanley 
keller a corporate lawyer with the boston firm of palmer amp dodge 
while businesses may object to some provisions such as a 
requirement of severance pay for workers laid off during and after 
takeovers the corporate community has been willing to buy into 
the legislation because it is well balanced keller said 
the law also requires buyers to assume the collective bargaining 
agreements of their target companies clarifies the authority of 
corporate boards to set up antitakeover defenses and raises the 
number of shares needed to call a special stockholder meeting to 40 
percent from 10 percent 
the law generally takes effect once a potential buyer obtains 5 
percent of the target companys stock one of the lowest thresholds 
in the nation in contrast delawares statute kicks in at 15 
percent and new yorks at 10 percent 
at the urging of mutual fund companies however the legislation 
allows institutional investors to acquire up to 15 percent of a 
company without triggering the antitakeover restrictions 
bernard black a professor of securities law at columbia 
university in new york called the measure basically a management 
protection statute that could have perverse effects 
dukakis and state secretary of economic affairs gray hedgespeth 
said the assetfreeze provision was designed to stop hostile raiders 
from borrowing heavily to acquire a company then selling off its 
parts to help pay the takeover debt 
black contended the asset freeze would deter beneficial economic 
activity 
what you hope for in a business combination is some sort of 
efficiency combining the targets operations with your own and 
slimming down because of economies of scale or scope he said 
the massachusetts statute and others like ithave the potential 
for preventing whatever efficiency gains may come from hostile 
takeovers

united airlines seeking a niche in the already 
crowded useuropean air travel market announced tuesday it hopes 
to begin serving the continent next spring from four american cities 
the nations secondlargest air carier said it has filed 
petitions for its proposed european routes with the us department 
of transportation 
united chairman and president stephen m wolf said that in the 
first phase of its plan united would begin flying next spring 
between its chicago and washington dc hubs to frankfurt and 
paris as well as between chicago and milan with continuing service 
to rome 
last month united said it also was seeking to begin service 
between chicago and warsaw with continuing service to budapest 
in the second phase the airline has asked for authority to link 
paris with both san francisco and new york united currently holds 
authority to fly between those cities and frankfurt but does not 
fly the routes 
combined with our extensive pacific routes and our 
comprehensive domestic network this action means that united will 
be a truly global airline in the 1990s wolf said 
in addition united has requested government approval to fly 
between london and san francisco chicago washington dc and new 
york it also seeks permission to fly between glasgow scotland and 
both chicago and washington 
within a year we expect to have a presence in several of the 
major transportation centers of europe and we will build 
aggressively upon that base he said 
analysts say uniteds announcement that it plans to serve europe 
from its us hubs is not a surprise 
basically when they ordered a number of boeing 767s their 
intent was very clear said helane becker a vice president of 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
earlier this year united announced orders for as many as 370 
boeing aircraft valued at 1574 billion the package includes firm 
orders for 180 boeing jetliners and options on 190 others 
uniteds movement into the major markets of europe like our 
recent recordbreaking aircraft order shows that we are committed 
to serving the transportation needs not only of america but also of 
a growing portion of the international market wolf said 
seven us airlines fly between the united states and europe 
usair continental delta pan american twa northwest and 
american the nations largest carrier 
it is not surprising they united want to serve europe out of 
major us cities that is everybodys goal ms becker said 
adding that the useurope air routes are very well served 
but relative to being a longterm viable competitor you have 
to look at all sorts of service 
the decision to expand service into europe is the latest 
indication that united has climbed out of the doldrums it wallowed 
in earlier in the decade 
in addition to acquiring aircraft in the past year the airline 
has snatched executive talent from other airlines come out with 
agressive marketing programs and has become more competitive at its 
hubs 
with uniteds renewed vigor has come rumors of a takeover attempt 
that have sent the price of parent ual corp stock soaring on the 
new york stock exchange traders began focusing on united as a 
takeover target after last months acceptance by nwa inc 
northwests parent company of a 365 billion buyout by los 
angeles investor alfred checchi 
analysts say a bid for united would substantially top that figure

imported foods that dont meet us standards 
regularly find their way to american dinner tables because 
government inspectors lack the resources to enforce federal 
regulations a congressional staff report said tuesday 
importers often exploit the weaknesses in the food and drug 
administrations inspection system and the lack of coordination 
between fda and the customs service to get substandard products onto 
the us market said the staff report of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations 
moreover the report said the chance that violators will be 
caught is slim and even when they are caught the penalties are so 
slight that violators view them as nothing more than a minor cost 
of doing business 
in 1987 the fda tested 2 percent of more than 1 million 
shipments of imported food the investigators wrote some 40 percent 
of the tested samples did not meet fda standards for reasons 
including contamination with salmonella pesticides insects and 
filth 
one cannot but wonder how many contaminated importations are 
overlooked the report said 
the subcommittee begins a series of hearings wednesday into the 
governments foodimport regulations 
the fda in responding to the report said it exaggerated some of 
the problems but the report is nevertheless correct in showing 
that increased imports have strained the federal governments system 
for sampling testing and blocking some questionable imports fda 
however has worked with the us customs service to coordinate our 
priorities and protect the public health 
the report details the ease with which shipments that are tested 
and rejected by the fda can still end up being sold to us 
consumers 
the fdas import operations branch in a march 1988 study cited 
by the congressional report estimated that more than 12 percent of 
all refused shipments got onto the us market anyway 
for instance importers sometimes give customs officials fake 
documentation purporting to show that rejected goods were destroyed 
when in fact they were sold to us distributors illegally 
another way importers evade the system is to port shop when 
a shipment is rejected the importer can take his goods to another 
port of entry and try again 
an example cited in the report occurred in puerto rico where the 
fda district office instituted an intensive examination of all 
shellfish over a sixweek period inspectors found that 75 percent 
of the shipments did not meet federal standards mostly from 
decomposition shellfish imports dropped dramatically 
san juan believed its efforts to improve shellfish quality had 
succeeded but subsequently found decomposed shellfish in the food 
distribution system the report said san juan concluded that 
the shellfish they refused to admit were entered at a mainland port 
and shipped back to puerto rico

los angeles businessman al checchi calling it the best available 
option for the carriers wellbeing

back the 4 billion offer by checchis acquisition group wings

however once we had an opportunity to review his checchis 
financial plan our concerns diminished somewhat he said 
nwa pilots have said they are running out of patience with the 
slack pace of contract negotiations theyve also said a strike 
would be disastrous for checchi who would pay shareholders of the 
eaganbased airline 121 a share

issues such as noise control

within the soviet union and to 125 destinations worldwide according 
to iata figures 
in 1988 the airline transported 126 million passengers making it 
the worlds largest carrier but only 4 million were on 
international flights compared to the 169 million people 
transported worldwide by british airways the biggest international 
carrier brindley said

boris ryzhenkov executive secretary of the soviet commission on 
international civil aviation presented the formal membership

the american stock exchange and two other 
major us exchanges separately are discussing merging with the 
philadelphia stock exchange the countrys oldest securities market 
the philadelphia exchange president said tuesday 
the talks come amid concerns by members of the philadelphia 
exchange that a new securities and exchange commission rule dealing 
with equity options will put the philadelphia market at a 
competitive disadvantage nicholas giordano said tuesday 
the rule which will be phased in beginning jan 21 1990 will 
prohibit exchanges from holding exclusive rights to deal in 
particular options 
the philadelphia exchange now handles about 13 percent of the 
nations options trading an option is a right to buy or sell a 
block of stock at a certain price within a stipulated time 
the philadelphia exchange has been approached numerous times 
about mergers in the past giordano said the talks with the 
american exchange and the two other unidentified exchanges grew 
serious after the sec rule change he said 
while our discussions with all three markets have been 
substantive the difficulties and complexities of affecting such a 
merger are great and we must be realistic about the likelihood of 
successful merger discussions giordano said 
we are proceeding on the assumption that the philadelphia stock 
exchange will be independent for at least another 200 years he 
said of the market founded in 1790 
giordano said determining whether a merger can be arranged would 
take months 
they are attracted primarily to our currency options and stock 
options marketplace but they are also attracted to our equity 
floor giordano said 
the philadelphia exchange tuesday also announced a 29 percent 
increase in stock trading volume and a 24 percent increase in equity 
options traded in the first six months of the year compared with 
the same period last year 
the philadelphia exchange and the american exchange have been 
bickering for months over philadelphias claim that the amex copied 
its idea for a new security cash index participations the cip 
which is tied to the standard and poors index of 500 stocks allows 
investors to speculate on the trend of the stock market 
shortly after the philadelphia exchange submitted its proposal to 
the sec the american exchange submitted a similar proposal since 
the sec approved trading of the participations earlier this year 
philadelphia exchange officials have made sharply worded public 
statements about the similarities of the amexs equity index 
participations 
on tuesday giordano said the argument consisted of normal 
business differences by giordano
