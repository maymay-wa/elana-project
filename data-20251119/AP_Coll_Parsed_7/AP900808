lawmakers rallied wednesday behind president 
bushs decision to dispatch troops to saudi arabia but cautioned 
against us forces defending the oilrich nation without the help 
of other countries 
a key senator warned that the next 48 hours is crucial 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
told reporters in atlanta that iraqs president wont be bluffed 
but i dont think what were doing is a bluff 
chances of an attack on saudi arabia will decline if one does 
not take place within 48 hours nunn said adding i hope and 
pray there will not be an attack but if there is one its 
likely to come before we have all our intelligence in place 
the arab countries must come to the party too senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas told reporters 
i hope we will not be the lone ranger like we were in 
vietnam sen alan cranston of california secondranking 
democrat said in a telephone interview from los altos calif 
the handful of senators and representatives still in the 
nations capital during a monthlong recess also expressed concerns 
that iraqi president saddam hussein could act quickly to seize 
saudi oilfields before troops are in place 
there is a danger of a hot war said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee saddam sees us 
coming he knows more troops will be there tomorrow and still more 
next week if he wants to move now is better than later 
aspin also commented that abu nidal the leader of one of the 
most infamous terrorist groups is back in baghdad he saddam 
may be fixing to loose abu nidal on the world 
the overriding reaction on capitol hill from democrats and 
republicans was praise for bushs action which calls for us 
troops to take up defensive positions in saudi arabia to deter 
further aggression from iraq 
the move was precipitated by iraqs invasion and takeover of 
kuwait last week 
bush declined to discuss the size of the us military force at 
a news conference but government sources said at least 5000 
ground troops were involved along with 140 sophisticated fighters 
and bombers and naval supply ships 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
supported bushs decision and hoped this action taken in 
cooperation with other friendly nations will deter an iraqi attack 
on saudi arabia and convince saddam hussein to withdraw his troops 
from occupied kuwait 
sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the senate armed 
services committee said the participation of us military 
forces in the defense of saudi arabia is clearly justified as part 
of the timely international effort to deter further iraqi 
aggression 
bush must set foreign policy goals for a military action and 
objectives which tell us whether the deployment is effective the 
president has done both said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo 
i applaud president bush for his decision to send in american 
forces to support saudi arabia against the threat of aggression 
from saddam hussein it is not just the saudis who are at risk 
americas national security is at risk as well said sen joseph 
lieberman dconn 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said the president was doing the right thing 
this action puts us forces in a position to inflict a very 
punishing attack on iraq if it should decide to invade saudi 
arabia boren said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio another member of the senate 
intelligence committee said he supported bushs decision 
describing it as in the best interest of the united states and the 
world 
it is disappointing that more of the arab nations are not 
standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the world in 
defending the independence and freedom of kuwait and saudi 
arabia metzenbaum said 
rep william broomfield of michigan ranking republican on the 
house foreign affairs committee said it was important that other 
regional powers understand that the world will not put up with 
naked aggression 
a senior member of the house armed services committee rep ike 
skelton dmo also stressed the importance of a joint operation 
i hope other arab states can get involved skelton said 
britain has said it would commit an unspecified number of its 
forces but egypt and morocco denied reports from some us sources 
that they would participate in a multinational operation 
id prefer to leave that to the saudis to announce bush 
told reporters when questioned about arab involvement 
dole asked about the length of time us forces would 
participate in the defense of saudi arabia said the president 
left the clear impression this morning that this could be quite 
long

president bush ordered us troops and warplanes to the front 
line of the explosive persian gulf standoff tuesday to guard oil 
giant saudi arabia against military giant iraq 
capitol hill sources said the troops would be part of a 
multinational force a condition set by the saudis and that egypt 
and morocco were joining the attempt to deter iraqs millionman 
army from storming saudi oil fields 
a fresh us navy task force set sail for the region meanwhile 
as an economic and military noose slowly tightened around iraq 
turkey shut down the iraqis vital oil outlet to the 
mediterranean honoring a un trade embargo ordered to punish iraq 
for last weeks lightning conquest of kuwait in saudi arabia the 
iraqi oil flow was reported slowing to a trickle through another 
pipeline 
despite the global pressure iraqi president saddam hussein 
remained defiant declaring in a nationwide speech that he would 
never back down and leave kuwait 
we would rather die than be humiliated he said and we 
will pluck out the eyes of those who attack the arab nation 
a crisis atmosphere took hold in official washington where bush 
called together his cabinet to review options for squeezing iraq 
and rolling back its invasion force which the white house declared 
an imminent threat to outmanned saudi arabia 
a pentagon source later said the president ordered us combat 
troops and warplanes sent to saudi arabia to help protect the 
usaligned desert kingdom against iraq the first us army units 
reported headed out are specially trained and equipped for rapid 
deployment in crisis zones 
pentagon sources said the units included the 18th airborne 
corps a commandandcontrol umbrella organization based at ft 
bragg nc the 24th mechanized infantry division at ft stewart 
ga the 101st airborne division at ft campbell ky and the 82nd 
airborne division at ft bragg 
diplomats meanwhile worked to arrange for evacuation of 
americans and other foreigners stranded in kuwait and iraq 
the state department advised americans not to travel to eastern 
saudi arabia or the gulf states of bahrain qatar oman or the 
united arab emirates travel to kuwait and iraq has not been 
possible since the invasion last week 
one military option was a multinational naval blockade against 
iraq but in moscow the foreign ministry deflated expectations 
that the soviet navy might join in saying naval muscleflexing 
is not the best line of action 
early foreign reaction to the us move described it as certain 
to strengthen the saudis but unlikely to bring a swift end to 
iraqs occupation of kuwait 
it is a protective measure said sir john moberly a former 
british ambassador to iraq who is now with the royal institute of 
international affairs in london but i agree that to get saddam 
hussein out of kuwait is a very different question and its a very 
long haul 
aftershocks of the gulf explosion still reverberated through the 
world economy 
the tokyo stock market fell sharply again tuesday on wall 
street the dow jones average was down slightly the london market 
edged upward 
crude oil prices continued to rise and stood onethird higher 
than prices two weeks ago driven up by fears of oil shortages 
senate and house subcommittees met in washington to investigate 
what some called a ripoff by oil companies that raised 
gasoline prices by as much as 19 cents a gallon after the invasion 
iraqi forces poured into kuwait last thursday after saddam 
complained that kuwaiti overproduction had driven down world oil 
prices and iraqi oil revenues he also accused kuwait of stealing 
oil from a border oilfield both countries claim 
in his speech tuesday saddam said the invasion rectified unjust 
borders drawn up by colonial powers the takeover of kuwait gave 
iraq control of 9 percent of world daily oil production 
a conquest of saudi arabia would raise the iraqcontrolled of 
world oil to almost 20 percent but the iraqis have repeatedly 
denied any plans for a followup invasion of saudi arabia 
many governments tuesday were drawing up regulations to enforce 
the antiiraq trade embargo ordered monday by the un security 
council at us urging if fully enforced the boycott could 
cripple iraq which depends heavily on its oil exports for economic 
survival 
at a maritime terminal in southeastern turkey turkish officials 
began turning away tankers seeking to take on iraqi oil and said 
they would shut down the pipeline from iraq within days cutting 
off more than half of iraqs oil exports 
at yanbu saudi arabia terminus of iraqs other key pipeline 
no tankers had loaded oil since the weekend oil executives said 
they spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said the oil flow had slowed to 200000 barrels a day from 
800000 because of the sharp falloff in demand for iraqi crude

glenn g morgan remembers the small purple 
fish that darted around his life raft and the malt tablets he used 
as bait to catch them in nets 
he remembers catching rainwater in a tarpaulin and the huge 
shark that lunged halfway into the raft then slid out just as 
abruptly and swam away 
but mostly morgan remembers the elation 45 years ago when after 
five days adrift he and about 300 other survivors of the uss 
indianapolis were pulled to safety 
the cruiser was sunk by a japanese submarine during world war ii 
in the worst disaster in us maritime history nearly 900 crewmen 
were killed 
about 70 survivors and some of their rescuers gather in 
indianapolis the ships namesake for a threeday reunion starting 
friday they have traveled here every five years since 1960 morgan 
expects more than 350 people to attend 
the indianapolis was sunk halfway between guam and the 
philippines on july 30 1945 two days earlier it had unloaded key 
parts of the atomic bomb at tinian where the enola gay would take 
off on its flight to end world war ii 
most of the ships 1196 crewmen were asleep morgan a 
21yearold buglemaster third class had just gotten off watch and 
was on the bridge 
when i hit the water off the side of the ship i swam away 
from it because id always heard it would suck you under he said 
in a recent telephone interview from his home in franklin texas 
clutching a rubber tube he often had used as a pillow morgan 
stayed afloat and watched in the moonlight as the ship tilted on 
its end propellers still churning then slipped underwater all 
within 12 minutes 
morgan caught sight of four life rafts and crawled into one with 
about 20 colleagues 
most crewmen werent so fortunate those who found life jackets 
bobbed in the oily water with no rations others were eaten alive 
by sharks or succumbed to their injuries 
morgans raft was equipped with rations small kegs of water and 
a firstaid kit a couple of the men were badly burned one died 
the next day 
the raft drifted away from the others 45 miles away when they 
finally were rescued 
the isolation was terrifying morgan said 
nobody knew we were sunk that was the brutal thing about 
this he said we were beginning to get down in the mouth after 
being in the water four and a half days 
but they kept their spirits up by fishing scanning the horizon 
and watching a big shark 
we called him charlie every time wed throw a spam can over 
hed get real curious and hed come around morgan said although 
it did lunge into the raft once old charlie never got violent 
by golly morgan said 
on the fifth day aviator wilbur gwinn spotted some survivors 
during a routine patrol and rescuers were alerted 
one of them was graham claytor commander of the destroyer cecil 
j doyle 
the warm spot i have for graham claytor was that he broke 
some navy regulations by turning on the big blue searchlights 
morgan said they certainly looked good to me oh how good they 
looked 
claytor went on to become secretary of the navy and is now 
president of amtrak 
the survivors were taken to hospital ships and medical centers 
at guam and the philippines when they were fit they were reunited 
in san diego 
their skipper capt charles mcvay iii was the only captain 
ever courtmartialed for the loss of his ship in battle he was 
charged with failing to take evasive maneuvers or zigzag in 
dangerous waters 
mcvay shot himself to death with his navy pistol in 1968 at his 
home in litchfield conn some of his crew believe he was a 
scapegoat morgan said

winds of independence blown from the 
north by an 800yearold ghost incarnate are giving rome a few 
shivers 
northern politicians have revived the lombard league a 12th 
century alliance of autonomyloving cities that fought the 
oppression of the holy roman empire 
they want to remove lombardy the most productive part of italy 
from the grasp of a slowmoving taxeating notoriously 
inefficient central government 
rome was stunned this spring by the leagues strong showing in 
local elections it became the secondranked party in the region 
behind premier giulio andreottis christian democrats 
part of the lombard leagues popularity stems from northern 
resentment of rome for sending workers from the underdeveloped 
south for the past 40 years to deliver their mail teach their 
children and police their streets 
northerners have disdained some of those jobs particularly 
police work because of the low pay and high risk others jobs 
such as teaching are based on national competitions the 
northerners claim are weighted in favor of people from the south 
in addition many bureaucratic posts are political appointments 
and northerners say southerners get most of them 
the league wants to end a virtual opendoor policy that is 
bringing a tide of poor immigrants to italy most of the latest 
arrivals are poor from north africa and asia 
on a wall of the league headquarters in a workingclass 
district of milan is a poster showing a plump chicken whose golden 
eggs tumble into a basket held by a fat farmers wife as the 
league sees it the chicken is productive lombardy and the peasant 
woman a parasitic south 
lombard league newspapers denounce rome for they say using 
money from the north for wasteful development programs in the south 
hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into construction 
projects in the naples area after the 1980 earthquake there for 
example but thousands of people made homeless by the disaster 
still live in makeshift housing 
sen umberto bossi said in an interview the party wants italy to 
become a federalist state with the central governments role 
limited to defense foreign policy taxes and some judicial matters 
bossi league president and its only member of parliament looks 
to switzerland lombardys neighbor across the alps as a model 
many lombards say they identify more with the rest of europe 
than with italy whose international image often is that of the 
south 
soccer may well be countrys strongest bond but northsouth 
bitterness emerged even during the world cup competition italy 
hosted this summer 
argentine soccer star diego maradona who plays for naples 
during the regular season was booed for trying to get his fans to 
root for argentina when it played the italian national team in 
naples he was accused of exploiting northsouth hatreds 
i never said that the neapolitans should root for argentina 
he said later i just made a few observations like the 
banners in verona when naples played there that said wash 
yourselves and welcome to italy 
charges that the league is racist make some northerners cautious 
in expressing sympathy for the party bossi rejects the racist 
label 
i didnt vote for the league but some of my friends did 
said claudio tarini on the train ride home to milan from rome 
where he had spent two days dealing with the bureaucracy to obtain 
the necessary permits for a business trip to nigeria 
while racism undoubtedly motivated some to vote for the league 
tarini said public disgust with rome was the principal reason for 
the election success 
as a newspaper columnist wrote in describing the average 
citizens entanglements with clerks and paperwork to meet ordinary 
requirements of daily life will i have to vote for the league to 
get a drivers license 
the column appeared in la stampa a national daily based in 
turin capital of the piedmont which borders lombardy and has its 
own regional party 
bossi says the league will begin collecting signatures in 
september to force a referendum on a law that allowed tens of 
thousands of third world immigrants to stay in italy 
after his election to the senate in 1987 bossi sponsored a bill 
that stopped the practice of sending convicted mafiosi from the 
south to internal exile in northern towns

bong jae jang rises before dawn and goes to the 
brooklyn terminal market where he stocks up on green plantain 
haitian mangos and other fruits and vegetables popular with the 
caribbean immigrants who used to shop at his store on church avenue 
in flatbush 
these days jangs trip is an academic exercise he knows most 
of the produce will sit unsold on the shelf rot in the july heat 
and wind up in the trash bin outside 
whos going to buy this he asks holding up a 
cellophanewrapped hunk of a vegetable called pium kim that is 
besieged by a swarm of tiny flies 
after six months a blackled boycott of jangs greengrocery 
continues even though the television cameras are gone and the 
pickets who gather outside the front door each afternoon have 
dwindled to a handful 
the boycotters avowed aim is to force the store to close 
jangs troubles began jan 18 when giselaine felissaint a 
haitian immigrant got into an argument with several of his 
employees over some merchandise one of them touched her she says 
the man knocked her down another employee says the man put his 
hands on her and she laid down 
five months passed before the stores manager pong ok jang was 
charged with assault but the incident immediately became a symbol 
of the tensions between the citys black and korean communities 
within a few months hundreds of demonstrators were gathering 
outside the store each day along with almost as many police and 
journalists pickets yelled racial slurs at the koreans and urged 
them to go back to where you came from 
tensions were heightened by the trial of some white youths 
accused of killing a black youth in the bensonhurst section in a 
special televised speech to the city mayor david dinkins pleaded 
for calm and understanding 
the problem runs far beyond a simple assault charge many blacks 
resent the way they are treated in some of the korean grocery 
stores that have opened in their communities and some are jealous 
of the immigrants business success the selfemployed account for 
67 percent of all city workers but only 34 percent of all black 
workers 
skeptics derided the boycott as a news media creation that would 
end as soon as the last camera crew departed they were wrong by 5 
pm there usually are about a dozen demonstrators behind the blue 
police barricades that line the sidewalk outside the store few 
neighborhood residents defy their cries of boycott and venture 
inside or visit another korean grocery across the street 
the stores have become a symbol of what has happened across 
this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black 
people says george dames a spokesman for the flatbush coalition 
for economic empowerment a boycott group it was not an isolated 
incident 
since may however tensions there have been lessening if not 
dramatically then incrementally says lonnie soury spokesman 
for the citys human rights commission 
the rev roy thompson of st pauls episcopal church agrees i 
can drive by the store without getting stuck in traffic for a 
halfhour 
dinkins has appointed a factfinding panel and called for an end 
to the boycott but none seems likely soon there still have been 
no direct negotiations between the korean and haitian communities 
let alone jang and mrs felissaint she has refused to denounce the 
boycott and has filed a 6 million suit against the store 
people say end it but we cant just wave a magic wand 
says soury of the human rights commission which is trying to get 
talks started 
were trying to identify leaders who represent those with 
legitimate interests there are people who dont have an interest 
in settling the issue he says we think that if we can get a 
group of people who can meet we can make progress but theyre not 
meeting now 
according to a poll taken last month only 13 percent of new 
yorkers supported the boycott while 58 percent supported the 
koreans among blacks only 27 percent sympathized with the 
boycotters while 37 percent sided with the koreans boycott 
leaders say the results simply reflected biased news coverage 
jang 35 says he came here in 1983 and worked for five years at 
another store before opening his own before the boycott he says 
he routinely worked 17 hours a day and was robbed three times he 
shows off the scar where a robbers bullet entered his abdomen last 
year 
his business is being sustained largely by 5000 to 7000 a 
month in donations from the citys other korean grocers they 
will support him until the boycott is over says michael kang of 
the korean produce association he is their maginot line they 
think theyre going to be next 
jang is infuriated by the refusal of the police department to 
enforce a judges order that the protesters be kept 50 feet from 
his door the city has appealed arguing that the police should be 
allowed to use discretion in deciding where the protesters should 
stand 
jang says neither dinkins nor police commissioner lee brown 
wants to stand up to the boycotters and pass responsibility for 
dealing with them back and forth he does not speak english very 
clearly but he gets his point across they play a pingpong 
game they killing my dream 
to soury the boycott is a tragedy two immigrant groups are 
pitted against each other he says when they should be 
fighting together to demand more government aid for small 
businesses for blacks and koreans and everyone else

hurricane diana battered mexicos gulf 
coast with 85 mph winds tuesday toppling trees and electricity 
poles in poza rica 25 miles inland federal highway police said 
red cross spokesman moises gutierrez pina said by telephone that 
at least one person was injured adding i dont doubt that there 
are more 
hundreds of residents fled lowlying areas before diana hit and 
hundreds more were left homeless in this city surrounded by oil 
fields 
police said 120 families were evacuated from their flooded homes 
in two city neighborhoods about 300 more people were taken to 
makeshift shelters when the storm blew the roofs off their houses 
the veracruz state government reported many areas were without 
electricity dozens of roads in the gulf coast area were blocked by 
fallen trees and at least 14 towns had no telephone service 
journalists driving through the area said storm damage extended 
as far inland as huachinango a town about 90 miles southwest of 
poza rica 
the government news agency notimex said the army was preparing 
to declare an emergency in the area and send in food and other 
relief 
at 1030 pm edt the eye of the storm was about 80 miles west 
of the gulf coast town of tuxpan according to the us national 
hurricane center near miami tuxpan is 180 miles northeast of 
mexico city 
the storm was moving in a westerly direction at 10 mph with 
winds diminished to 45 mph the center said 
it said people in mountainous areas north of mexico city were 
threatened by flash floods and mud slides from heavy rains 
diana carried 90 mph winds while still at sea and winds of up 
to 85 mph when it hit the coastal regions 
telephone lines to tuxpan were out the red cross and highway 
police in poza rica on higher ground 30 miles southwest of tuxpan 
said they had no radio contact with the coastal town 
poza rica police said diana blew down palms and other trees and 
power lines cutting off electricity to poza rica fallen trees and 
telephone lines blocked some streets but major roads to the city 
were open the red cross said 
gutierrez pina said a man in poza rica was cut when hit by 
falling roof tiles and that another person was treated for 
hysteria 
small craft were warned to remain in port from baffin bay 
texas southward phone lines to some cities along the 400mile 
stretch of mexican coast threatened by the storm were out 
one man was killed monday night in veracruz down the coast from 
tuxpan when winds blew over a tree said rosalio romero hernandez 
a red cross spokesman in veracruz 
rainfall of 10 inches or more was expected along dianas path 
said max mayfield a specialist at the us national hurricane 
center near miami tides were expected to be four to six feet above 
normal he said 
the main threat to life will be the rising waters on the coast 
and the heavy rains producing flash floods and possibly mud slides 
inland said mayfield 
a tropical storm warning was in place from la pesca to boca 
jesus maria about 100 miles south of brownsville texas 
tropical storm force winds extended up to 200 miles out from the 
center the weather service said 
diana is the second storm of the atlantic season to reach 
hurricane strength as a tropical storm it soaked mexicos yucatan 
peninsula on monday but did little damage 
tropical storm cesar meanwhile weakened to a tropical 
depression and was in the midatlantic about 1150 miles 
eastsoutheast of bermuda with top sustained winds of nearly 35 mph 
tropical depressions become named storms once sustained winds 
reach 39 mph a storm becomes a hurricane when winds hit 74 mph

a growing movement is afoot to rid india 
of a pervasive vestige of the british colonial raj the english 
language 
it wont be easy 
english is the language of law government and some of the best 
modern indian literature 
it is spoken by the wealthy and welleducated who have dominated 
politics and business since independence in 1945 they often are 
called derisively the brown sahibs 
kapil kapoort a linguistics professor predicted the movement 
would grow because knowledge of english provides privileges to a 
few but it deprives privileges to many 
experts estimate 35 million indians know some english that is 
more than the population of canada double that of australia and 
about half the number of people in britain but only 4 percent 
indias 880 million 
antienglish sentiment has arisen periodically sometimes 
accompanied by violence this year the campaign has gone farther 
than before toward eliminating english from official business in 
some of indias 25 states 
mulayam singh yadav who leads the government of uttar pradesh 
the most populous state banned the official use of english in 
april he instructed the courts to conduct their business 
exclusively in hindi the language of about 200 mllion people in 
northern india 
yadav also suggested forbidding english as the language of 
instruction in private schools where the children of many 
welltodo indians are educated 
two other hindispeaking states in northern and central india 
have ordered all official correspondence and public announcements 
made in hindi 
in goa on the southwest coast the local government tried to 
cut off public funds for englishlanguage schools and teachers 
blocked the main highway for three days in protest 
at a seminar in new delhi last month yadav of utter pradesh 
said i will happily accept any indian language as our national 
language but english must go 
there are plenty of indigenous tongues to choose from 
india has 15 recognized official languages including english a 
census in 1971 indicated 1652 languages and dialects were spoken 
33 of them by more than a million people each 
english billboards and signs rule the streets of new delhi in 
the heart of the hindi belt onefourth of all the newspapers 
circulated in india are in english as are 40 percent of the books 
said publisher ravi dayal 
its not that easy to get rid of english said mp chhaya 
a consultant for the education department its only possible if 
one common language besides english is accepted that wont happen 
soon 
one advantage of english is its neutrality although hindi is by 
far the most widely spoken language southern indians say adopting 
it as the official national tongue would amount to accepting 
northern domination 
chhaya said in an interview english was thrust on us by the 
british they were the rulers and we had no choice now we are a 
democracy you cant thrust hindi down everyones throat 
even politicians who rail most loudly against english send their 
children to englishlanguage schools he said 
in the englishlanguage indian express publisher dayal wrote 
regional languages now dominate administrative activity in the 
states english has its own niche in the government at the center 
federal level and in communications with the states in the 
higher courts in some universities 
home minister mufti mohammed sayed questioned in parliament 
about his sincerity in promoting indian languages admitted his 
office had 633 typewriters in english and only 57 in the devnagri 
script used for hindi 
the constitution was written in english said kapoor 
director of the center for linguistics and english at jawaharlal 
nehru university maybe 98 percent of the people cant read it 
but they are supposed to swear by it 
english is an instrument for making people feel inferior he 
said in an interview 
persian was the administrative language of the mogul emperors 
who united most of india in the 16th century then english became 
the tongue that linked the nation together 
sanskrit ons and the medium of 
indias classics has been dead as a spoken idiom for 1000 years 
after 40 years of studying english kapoor said he began to 
appreciate his own culture when he discovered the importance of 
sanskrit and early indian literature to western thinkers 
in this prestigious university there is no department or 
chair in sanskrit he said we have chairs in all kinds of 
classical languages but not our own 
resentment of indias ruling class feeds the antienglish 
movement 
they are a class of people deliberately created by the 
british kapoor said they are english in taste and opinion 
and indian in blood and color

editors associated press photographer alistair sinclair spent 
10 weeks in monrovia until his evacuation by us marines on monday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
life in monrovia has collapsed into 
random terror and widespread starvation as rebel forces close in on 
beleaguered president samuel doe 
since rebels began besieging the capital a few weeks ago does 
troops have been ransacking shops restaurants warehouses offices 
and homes 
in the morning countless dead bodies bear witness to the random 
violence of the night before some are headless others are missing 
parts of skulls or limbs liberians say the missing parts are used 
in cannibalistic rituals by soldiers of does krahn tribe 
a coconut plantation near monrovias beaches has become known as 
the killing field because of the number of corpses dumped there 
daily in troughs dug by bulldozers civilians blame does troops 
for the killings 
the stench of rotting bodies pervades monrovia a city scarred 
by rocket and mortar fire 
but the rebels have also been blamed for killings 
in one incident last week prince johnson a rebel leader shot 
a liberian man wearing a red cross bib twice as he pleaded for his 
life 
johnson had accused the man who was handcuffed to a foreign 
relief services worker of profiteering from rice sales 
you are traitor johnson said as he fired a burst of fire 
from his ak47 assault rifle at the man 
the man fell to the ground wounded and lifted his head 
why why he asked 
pointing at the dying man johnson said to the french relief 
worker jacques monthouroy you are lucky you are a foreign 
diplomat he then fired another burst at the pleading liberian 
man killing him 
the victims identify was not known monthouroy a frenchman 
working for the us catholic relief services was released after 
the us embassy vouched for him 
rice the staple of liberias 23 million people is scarce in 
the capital starving monrovians eat grass and weeds from seaside 
swamps and river banks to survive 
the citys water supply was cut nearly two months ago people 
scoop water from creeks drains and ponds crowds stampede into 
gardens of homes with wells 
no car is safe from robbery by doe troops who menace occupants 
including ambassadors relief workers and liberian legislators with 
their rifles 
in late july johnson won control of the citys northern bushrod 
island suburb and two bridges linking it to downtown monrovia 
where doe is holed up in his heavily fortified cliffside mansion 
johnsons guerilla rival charles taylor has moved into 
monrovias eastern suburb of paynesville and randomly slaughtered 
civilians of the krahn and mandingo tribes the mandingo are 
accused of supporting doe 
does troops have targeted civilians of the gio and mano tribes 
which support the rebels 
the rebels invaded liberia in december accusing doe of 
corruption and human rights abuses 
relief workers are often accused of taking sides in the war the 
international committee of the red cross which had given its 
protection to refugees at st peters lutheran church where 600 
refugees were massacred said its two representatives in monrovia 
were in hiding and incapable of protecting refugees 
when johnson began distributing rice to starving monrovians his 
soldiers had to fire into the air to control the huge crowds that 
came begging for food 
they later began firing at knee level wounding at least four 
people including a 24yearold woman

a mysterious woman has paid the fines for five 
prodemocracy activists convicted of illegally using megaphones and 
collecting money without a permit 
court officials said a woman in black who declined to identify 
herself paid the fines totaling about 100 on monday 
the five activists had refused to pay the fines saying they 
would rather go to jail they said they did not know the mystery 
woman or her motives for helping them 
their supporters have described the case as a show trial 
aimed at suppressing political activity in this british crown 
colony they accuse britain of bowing to china which will regain 
sovereignty over hong kong in 1997 and is opposed to a faster pace 
of democracy for hong kong 
the five were prosecuted under a 1933 law that forbids the use 
of bullhorns the law has rarely been invoked and is widely ignored 
by teachers and tour guides who use bullhorns 
the five activists members of the united democrats of hong 
kong have appealed their july 27 conviction 
the prosecution against us is clearly politically motivated 
and we will continue to appeal said one of the activists yeung 
sum a lecturer at the university of hong kong 
although their fines have been paid yeung said the activists 
will still seek a court hearing on their appeal

the african national congress 
decision to end its armed struggle against the south african 
government is just a first step in what promises to be a long and 
difficult quest for peace 
there is no guarantee the two sides will find a peaceful 
solution to three centuries of racial conflict there is growing 
violence and the threat of major confrontation as rival groups 
struggle for power 
anc leader nelson mandela announced tuesday after talks with the 
government that his group was ending its military operations the 
ceasefire clears the way for talks on ending whiteminority rule 
the way is now open to proceed towards negotiations on a new 
constitution the two sides said in a joint declaration 
the two sides have made enormous strides since president fw de 
klerk legalized the anc and other opposition groups in february and 
freed mandela after 27 years in jail in just a few months the 
white government that created apartheid has pledged to share power 
with the black majority 
but both sides admit that this is just a beginning 
south africas racial conflict has been going on for some 350 
years in that time there have been virtually no attempts to have 
blacks and whites live together in peace and equality 
political violence has soared since de klerk legalized 
opposition groups and began political reforms most of the violence 
pits rival black factions against each other as they scramble for 
power 
some 4000 blacks have been killed in savage fighting in natal 
province in recent years between anc groups and inkatha a 
conservative political movement the violence is spreading to other 
provinces and enveloping other groups 
the violence seems to be growing despite repeated promises from 
the anc and the government to make every effort to stop the 
killings 
the peace process also faces violent resistance from rightwing 
whites who oppose any settlement with the black majority the 
extremists have demanded the creation of a separate white state 
white extremists have been implicated in a recent wave of 
bombings and killings security officials say even a few dozen 
white extremists heavily armed and with supporters in the security 
forces could cause havoc 
enormous divisions remain between whites and blacks each group 
has little understanding or knowledge of the other contact between 
most whites and blacks is minimal and there is enormous distrust 
and fear on both sides 
whites still dominate politics and the economy official figures 
indicate that 5 percent of south africans virtually all of them 
white own 88 percent of the countrys wealth 
the anc and other opposition groups contend that political 
equality must be matched by a drastic redistribution of wealth to 
quickly ease the plight of the millions of poor blacks the 
government agrees there is a need for change but opposes any 
scheme that would threaten free enterprise and private property 
some observers fear that if a government led by the anc attempts 
to ease black poverty by redistributing wealth by legislation or 
other means it could provoke a white revolt others say it will 
wreck the economy 
de klerk has indicated he is seeking guarantees under any future 
black majority government that will leave whites with considerable 
power and wealth 
there are indications some anc leaders believe the negotiations 
are to arrange a hand over of power such a misunderstanding could 
make it very difficult for the two sides to find a workable 
compromise

iraq has stepped up its efforts to jam the 
arabiclanguage broadcasts of the british broadcasting corp world 
service the bbc said 
the bbc expanded its arabiclanguage broadcasts from nine to 10 
hours a day last week following the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
bbc engineers have detected interference with the world 
services arabic transmissions on a range of shortwave frequencies 
serving the middle east 
they have traced the jamming to a site south of baghdad the bbc 
said tuesday englishlanguage broadcasts have not been affected 
jamming the bbc is always the last resort of those who wish to 
suppress the truth and in a way it is a tribute to the role of 
the world service at times of crisis said david witherow deputy 
managing director of the bbc world service 
jamming is never entirely effective and i am sure that 
listeners throughout the region are relying on the bbc for news

forecasting weather is an imprecise science at 
best but the chance that people might heed a bleak forecast that 
doesnt come true has some massachusetts restaurant operators up in 
arms 
all too often complains frank catania a television weather 
forecaster will predict rain or snow and instead the sun will 
shine over empty tables at his restaurants 
theyre not god theyre going to make mistakes catania 
said 
while many people would like more detail in the forecasts and a 
warning of even a chance of rain or snow that might affect their 
lives some people in the restaurant business have mounted a 
campaign to get television prognosticators to tone down their 
predictions 
were not asking them to say the weathers always going to be 
nice said cindy eid public affairs coordinator for the 
massachusetts restaurant association were looking for some 
responsibility on their part 
the restaurant group has formed a weather task force which 
aims to educate meteorologists about the way their nightly 
forecasts can affect business 
the group especially doesnt like fiveday forecasts 
bruce schwoegler a forecaster for wbztv in boston says he is 
always careful to call that a five day outlook trying to draw 
a distinction with shortrange forecasts that tend to be more 
reliable 
schwoegler said he also has told viewers not to make their 
weekend plans based on mondays weather predictions 
john orgler meteorologist with the national weather service in 
boston said he too would not encourage people to make plans 
based on longrange predictions 
it only makes sense to wait for the day before to get 
something more reliable and up to date he said 
but the restaurateurs think that apparently hasnt sunk in with 
some people the restaurant group has collected letters from 
members around the state to illustrate their point 
e thomas mccabe jr president of tom foolerys in westboro 
described how on more than one occasion no snowstorms materialized 
after alarmist weather forecasts turning 13000 fridays 
into 7000 fridays 
even the prestigious harvard club of boston joined in a letter 
from the club said a weather forecaster who cried wolf last 
year led to the cancellation of a dinner for 250 people 
the industry is especially sensitive on cape cod where people 
will make weekend plans well in advance 
catania vice president of danl websterhearth n kettle which 
runs an inn and several restaurants on the cape recalled how a tv 
forecaster earlier this year advised people to scrap their sunday 
golf plans because it was going to rain 
guess what i played golf on sunday on the cape and i got a 
suntan he said 
some restaurant operators suggest weather forecasters simply add 
a few more cautionary phrases to their delivery and refrain from 
sensationalized pronouncements 
were not trying to impinge on their creative talents eid 
said we just want them to be aware that there are economic 
implications when they make forecasts

president bush on tuesday dispatched american 
warplanes and ground troops to saudi arabia where sources said a 
multinational military force was being created to defend the 
vulnerable oil kingdom from attack by iraq 
capitol hill sources said egypt and morocco were joining the 
effort part of an accelerating international response to saddam 
husseins invasion of kuwait 
while using an oil embargo in an effort to reverse the kuwaiti 
invasion allied forces hoped the unusual multinational defense of 
saudi arabia would deter saddams millionman iraqi army from 
storming the saudi oil fields as well 
there was no announcement from the white house of the military 
moves word came from authoritative pentagon sources and from 
capitol hill the white house said president bush would address the 
nation on television at 9 am wednesday 
were not playing games there are strategic reasons why i 
cant tell you said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater he 
declared we believe there is an imminent threat to saudi 
arabia 
plans drawn up by us officials called for the international 
force to serve as a trip wire to deter saddam 
explaining the governments reasoning for pulling together 
troops from a number of nations to protect the saudi kingdoms 
outnumbered 38000man army one pentagon official said if 
saddam hussein sees a group of saudi american moroccan and even 
german soldiers staring at him across the border he may have 
little inclination to move any further 
in what appeared to be an effort to enlist americas european 
partners in iraqi sanctions or the saudi defense effort secretary 
of state james a baker iii made plans to meet friday in brussels 
with the foreign ministers of the 15 us allies in europe after a 
quick consultation trip to turkey 
the new york times said in wednesday editions that the united 
states was prepared to invite the soviet union to participate in an 
international naval blockade and had signalled to the soviet 
union china britain and france that a blockading force would be 
needed soon 
in moscow however the soviet foreign ministry called a 
blockade not the best line to take 
the washington post said britain had agreed to cooperate in a 
blockade both newspapers attributed their reports to unidentified 
us officials 
the post also said unidentified us intelligence officials 
reported that iraqi forces appeared to have been loading poison gas 
aboard combat aircraft tuesday iraq has a large stock of chemical 
weapons and has used them against kurdish rebels as well as against 
iranian troops in its 19801988 war with iran 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition of not being identified 
by name said they expected army units heading for saudi arabia to 
include elements of the 82nd airborne division from fort bragg 
nc the 24th division mechanized from fort stewart ga and the 
101st airborne division from fort campbell ky near clarksville 
tenn the 82nd and the 101st make up the 18th airborne corps 
the three divisions together would total about 44800 soldiers 
if all elements of each division including a georgia national 
guard brigade in the 24th were assembled 
the airborne divisions would protect saudi air bases so that 
other troops aircraft and equipment can be sent in a 
congressional source said bush had decided to send f16 fighters 
f15 fighters and tanker aircraft from bases within the united 
states adding to the option of using fighter aircraft from navy 
carriers 
nbc news said tuesday evening that special forces troops had 
been in saudi arabia for the previous 24 hours 
meantime the carrier saratoga and four escort ships steamed out 
of mayport naval station in florida on a weeks voyage to the 
mediterranean the battleship wisconsin was to leave norfolk va 
too joining the eisenhower and the carrier independence in the 
region 
pentagon sources said the eisenhower would pass through the suez 
canal tuesday night en route to the persian gulf 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said if the deployments in saudi arabia were taking 
place as reported i think this is the right thing to do it 
discourages iraq from invading 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said the reported deployment would amount to a 
clear signal of our commitment to defend saudi arabia from a 
possible iraqi attack 
but he said the united states should not expect that saudi 
arabia will implement united nations sanctions against iraq and 
close the iraqi oil pipeline through its territory 
the bush administration has asked the saudis to shut off the 
flow of iraqi oil through its territory as turkey said it would 
tuesday 
defense secretary dick cheney was in egypt tuesday to seek that 
countrys cooperation and later traveled to morocco to discuss the 
situation with king hassan his whirlwind tour had begun with a 
stop in saudi arabia 
fitzwater said bush told his cabinet that he views the iraqi 
troops lined up in kuwait facing saudi arabia as a threat to united 
states security interests 
the spokesman also reported that in a tense twohour session 
monday between saddam and the highest ranking american official in 
iraq charge daffaires joseph wilson saddam indicated he had no 
intention of leaving kuwait and had every indication of staying and 
claiming it as his own 
the iraqi leader underscored that reading in a message over 
baghdad radio in which he defended the invasion as necessary to 
correct flawed regional borders drawn up by colonial powers 
the invasion marked a new period in which the sun will shine 
on us in the coming days he was quoted as saying 
fitzwater would not comment on a washington post report that 
saddam had warned wilson that he would attack saudi arabia if his 
pipeline through that country were cut off two state department 
officials insisting on anonymity said saddam leveled no such 
threat 
elsewhere venezuelan president carlos andres perez promised to 
do everything he could to make up the 45 million barreladay 
shortfall in oil stemming from iraqs invasion of kuwait an 
administration official traveling with vice president dan quayle 
said quayle met perez while both were in bogota for the 
inauguration of cesar gaviria as president of colombia 
perez was quoted as telling quayle that venezuela and other opec 
states were working to stabilize oil prices at or near the cartels 
agreed price of 21 a barrel the price has soared to more than 28 
a barrel since the invasion 
the new york times said in wednesday editions that saudi arabia 
was expected to increase output by 2 million barrels a day about a 
40 percent increase 
bush had declared on monday that sanctions approved 130 by the 
united nations security council will be enforced whatever it 
takes but on tuesday he had nothing to add saying at the white 
house im just not going to take any questions today thanks 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said an international naval blockade to isolate iraq 
which depends on imported food is very likely unless the iraqis 
back off and start moving out of kuwait undoing last weeks 
invasion 
concern over the fate of americans and other westerners trapped 
in baghdad appeared to ease 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that 28 
americans picked up monday by iraqi troops in kuwait have turned up 
in a baghdad hotel but are not being allowed to leave

the gaily painted carousel on the national 
mall is still taking tourists on a gentle musical swing through 
yesteryear but officials at the smithsonian institutions nearby 
headquarters are bracing for a bumpy financial ride into the future 
anticipating a new era of austerity after a quartercentury of 
extraordinary expansion the smithsonian is delaying the start of 
several major construction and renovation projects and searching 
for ways to trim its costly payroll of 6600 employees 
at the moment robert mcc adams secretary of the smithsonian 
is gratified that a house subcommittee recently voted to boost his 
federal appropriation next year by nearly 18 percent from 267 
million to 313 million even more than he had requested 
nevertheless adams is worried about ominous portents of a 
longterm budget squeeze including economic disruptions from the 
persian gulf crisis and the threat of almost unbelievably 
devastating automatic spending cuts in midoctober under the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law 
the smithsonian has been generously treated for a very long 
time adams said recently but i think it is the case that the 
numbers are large enough now that we cannot expect them to continue 
as they have in the past 
we have to face the fact that we are likely to grow more 
slowly in the years ahead he said in a telephone interview from 
his vacation home in basalt colo 
an early casualty of the impending budget crunch was 
undersecretary dean w anderson who resigned in late july as 
adams daytoday overseer of the sprawling smithsonian complex of 
14 museums and galleries plus the national zoo 
after 17 boom years at the smithsonian anderson made clear he 
had little stomach for presiding over personnel and program 
cutbacks in future years of retrenchment and streamlining of 
managerial staff 
andersons resignation resulted in scare headlines suggesting 
that the smithsonian had plunged into a severe financial crisis 
adams wrote a letter to the editor of the washington post 
complaining that the press reports may leave the public with the 
erroneous impression that the smithsonian is about to close its 
doors 
the smithsonian is still very much in business but the growing 
budgetary pinch that it shares with other federal agencies may be 
more visible at the smithsonians vast cultural and scientific 
enterprises which attracted 242 million visitors last year 
the national museum of natural history for example has more 
than 50 staff vacancies leaving gaps in the museums farflung 
research activities and threatening to delay curatorial work for 
future exhibitions 
in april the hirshhorn museum and sculpture garden temporarily 
closed an entire floor of its galleries of modern art because it 
couldnt afford to pay the guards the national museum of american 
history has abandoned its school programs bilingual activities and 
its plans to bolster hiring of minority staffers 
the smithsonian receives virtually no federal money to mount 
major exhibitions even though 84 percent of its current 353 
million budget comes from congressional appropriations and the rest 
from various trust funds gifts and profitmaking ventures 
as a result american history was forced to rely on computer and 
telecommunications industry donors to finance its ambitious 
information age show which opened in may raising questions 
about corporate influence over exhibition content 
the national air and space museum desperately needs additional 
storage space but adams says construction of a planned 330 
million museum extension at dulles international airport may be in 
jeopardy if budget cuts require postponement of building plans 
at the national zoo director michael robinson said additional 
budget cuts could have grave consequences by forcing the zoo to 
suspend modernization projects and curtail education conservation 
and research activities 
adams said his major priorities are to build a 175 million 
national museum of the american indian on the mall the 
smithsonians 15th museum and decide what form an 
africanamerican presence should take in washington 
he also is determined to expand cultural diversity at the 
smithsonian with greater focus on minority interests and pursue 
research and education on protecting the environment 
last week the white house budget office told the smithsonian to 
begin preparing for a 32 percent spending cut if budget negotiators 
fail to meet grammrudmans deficit reduction target by the oct 1 
start of the fiscal year 
to compensate for a projected loss of 77 million in federal 
funds next year adams envisioned cancellation of museum programs 
drastically shorter museum hours and widespread job layoffs

voters narrowly approved a 50 million 
bond issue to renovate and expand the aging kansas city zoo 
with all precincts reporting the issue had 37514 yes votes or 
584 percent and 26517 no votes or 41 percent it needed 57 
percent of the vote to pass 
the money will be used to more than double the size of the 
80acre zoo on the citys east side and increase the number of 
species from 168 to 263 
the plan also calls for new african and australian exhibits that 
allow species to interact as they do in the wild 
supporters said renovation would boost slumping attendance and 
assure better care for animals at the 81yearold zoo 
opponents said the city should focus on more pressing problems 
such as drugs crime and homelessness 
they also said it was the wrong time to add to kansas city tax 
bills the bond issue will add an estimated 10 a year to the 
average homeowners property tax 
residents of the school district already face a likely 24 
property tax hike for teacher salaries approved by a federal judge 
and awaiting school board acion

cool weather in august is concerning many 
farmers whose lateplanted corn and soybeans might run into an 
early frost in a few weeks 
that would reduce grain yields and put a crimp into agriculture 
department predictions of bumper harvests this fall and a generally 
rosy outlook for the coming year 
but its premature to make such dire weather predictions says 
usda meteorologist jeffrey a andresen farmers bankers and grain 
traders will have to sweat a while longer 
based on normal weather i would think the odds and statistics 
would favor the crop maturing normally and not having any 
problems andresen said 
the usda will issue its first surveybased estimate of 1990 
production of corn soybeans and other fallharvested crops on 
thursday those estimates will be updated again in september 
october and november 
heavy rains kept farmers out of their fields over much of the 
country last spring delaying planting and reducing the chance for 
optimum yields but the growing season has been a dandy for the 
most part and now the worry is about early freezes in the northern 
areas 
a weekly weather and crop report on tuesday showed corn 
development still running far behind normal in much of the main 
production areas 
in iowa for example 85 percent of the corn was in the silking 
stage compared with a normal development of 98 percent illinois 
was even more behind at 79 percent compared with 100 percent 
usually by now 
andresen said in a telephone interview tuesday that he knows of 
no precursor to help predict an early frost most he said are 
microclimatic phenomena that happen only occasionally on a 
significant scale 
the last time an early frost did major economic damage was in 
1974 when freezing weather clipped some of the corn and 
soybeans andresen said 
on the other hand farmers in 1984 had a very late spring and 
crops were planted well into june he said those crops went on to 
mature for the fall harvest 
the threat of frost begins in the corn belt sometime in the 
first couple of weeks of september he said that early area 
would include southern minnesota and parts of northern iowa 
but most of the major part of the corn belt does not 
experience the first 32degree fahrenheit weather until sometime in 
early october andresen said 
the recent belownormal temperatures have been fantastic as 
far as pollination and silking of corn is concerned he said but 
some warmer weather would be welcome now for development to speed 
it up a bit 
andresen added were just going to have to keep our finger 
crossed but i would say again the statistics and the odds still do 
favor a normal completion of the season

soybeans might be more attractive as human 
food if a world standard for protein nutritional quality is 
adopted according to agriculture department officials 
a new method of measuring food proteins was proposed by the 
departments agricultural research service and canadas food 
directorate said william h tallent assistant administrator of 
the research agency 
the uscanada proposal and evaluation were made for the food 
and agriculture organization an agency of the united nations an 
fao committee is recommending that countries adopt the new method 
with the current method based on nutritional needs of rats 
rather than humans soy protein ranks only about twothirds as high 
as animal protein tallent said tuesday the new method is 
simpler cheaper and more meaningful because its based on human 
needs 
tallent is us delegate to the vegetable protein committee 
part of the codex alimentarius commission that sets food standards 
for the fao 
retired food technologist frank mcdonough who organized much of 
the international testing of the methods reliability said the new 
method could help the image of vegetable protein particularly us 
soybean products 
soy protein scores higher for nutritional quality under the 
new standard and the united states produces most of the soy 
protein in world markets mcdonough said

apple juice is gaining favor in japan says an 
agriculture department trade report 
this increasing thirst is expected to grow at an annual rate 
of more than 10 percent for the next several years from the 1989 
level of 54000 metric tons as consumers switch to highquality 
fruit juices the report said 
until recently it added juice consumption was limited to 
relatively poor quality fruit beverages because of strict 
government controls on fruit juice that limited the supply of 100 
percent fruit juice 
but supplies are improving due to expansion of import quotas 
and japanese liberalization of apple grape and pineapple imports 
on april 1 1990 the report said

good title good vibes 
it describes precisely the first composition commissioned by 
classical jazz at lincoln center as conducted tuesday by its 
creator benny carter the night before his 83rd birthday 
good vibes is what the audience felt for 35 minutes the 
vibraphone the solo instrument each of the six movements was a 
delight musically and somehow set the mood of an enjoyable social 
occasion 
carter led a 17piece band sometimes playing his saxophone he 
wrote for unusual instrumentation putting the spotlight on two 
vibraphones his soloists for the premiere were bobby hutcherson 
and milt jackson 
they are splendid players and so was the band carter has 
written for a melodic swing band like fletcher henderson or count 
basie more than the driving big band style of buddy rich woody 
herman or stan kenton 
hutcherson who was inspired to play vibraphone by hearing a 
record by jackson makes a dashing attack on the instrument his 
notes are clean and clear and heard individually jackson is more 
subtle playing smooth phrases 
but carter didnt always compose to those leanings he gave 
hutcherson the solo in the movement titled ballad for bobby 
which had some melancholy and lovely chords and turned romantic 
and jackson was given some fast urgent passages 
it was marvelous to hear both vibraphonists play enough to get a 
rounded sense of their abilities 
the first half of the concert in alice tully hall had pianist 
james williams bassist ron carter and drummer billy higgins 
hutcherson played with them on a tune which went from slow to fast 
to mellow a pretty ballad and a jumprightin number jackson then 
played with them on if i were a bell willow weep for me 
and a flowing elegant riff 
before presenting his good vibes carter led the big band in 
a few of the songs he has written vine street rumble sao 
paulo the south side samba and the lovely evening star 
which he said he titled blue star until he wrote lyrics for it 
and needed an additional syllable

if and at this point its a big optimistic 
if us and world pressure forces iraqs saddam hussein to pull 
back from kuwait three of americas best friends in the middle 
east stand to gain new stature 
the three are egypt which has stood virtually alone in the arab 
world alongside the united states jordan which ironically stood 
apart and israel which has sounded warnings about baghdad that 
until now were considered exaggerated 
saddams drive into kuwait shocked the bush administration into 
a starker perception of the iraqi leader than policymakers were 
willing to consider only a few weeks ago sanctions urged by 
congress were sidestepped then as too harsh although consideration 
was given to restoring iraq to the state departments list of 
countries that support terrorism 
now with kuwait in the hands of an invading iraqi force and 
us troops preparing to defend saudi arabias oil fields the 
united states seems poised to take saddam on preferably through 
an economic blockade backed by an international armada 
in pursuit of this strategy president bush sent defense 
secretary dick cheney on the road to persuade the saudis their oil 
fields must be secured and then to egypt to stake out bases there 
today secretary of state james a baker iii was flying to turkey 
and then to brussels on friday where the 16 nato countries will 
develop a blockade strategy 
historically the sense of brotherhood that permeates the arab 
world makes it difficult for outside powers like the united states 
to gain overt support from one country against another 
that makes egyptian president hosni mubaraks decision to line 
up with washington against saddams invasion of kuwait all the more 
remarkable 
egypt by virtue of being the only arab country to sign a peace 
treaty with israel already is held in special regard by the us 
administration 
mubarak also is the key us conduit to the palestine liberation 
organization in bakers so far unsuccessful attempt to set up 
negotiations between israel and palestinian arabs 
cairo receives nearly 3 billion in annual assistance from the 
united states any reasonable request for additional economic or 
military help is apt to get a sympathetic hearing at the white 
house and on capitol hill 
if iraq submits to pressure and withdraws jordan also will 
benefit but under very different circumstances 
unlike mubarak the jordanian monarch king hussein did not 
rally to the us banner in fact he disputed the bush 
administrations assessment of the iraqi leader 
on saturday as iraqi troops solidified their hold on kuwait 
the king said it was premature for arab countries to condemn the 
invasion hussein called the iraqi leader a patriotic man 
whatever motivated the king to defer to his more powerful 
neighbor jordan offers safe passageway from iraq and 78 tourists 
most of them japanese exited that way on monday and if under 
increasing pressure saddam elects to seek a diplomatic compromise 
he might well ask jordan to play a middleman role 
the third biggest gainer could be israel which understandably 
is maintaining a low profile as the united states marshals the 
forces to stop saddam 
nine years ago israel destroyed iraqs only nuclear facility in 
what jerusalem described as a preemptive strike in todays middle 
east the israelis worry just as much about iraqi missiles and 
chemical weapons 
but they may not be inclined to take the same political and 
diplomatic risk they chanced in june 1981 by leveling the osirak 
reactor near baghdad nor may israel have to 
the united states with infinitely more prestige than the small 
jewish state could ever hope to muster is leading a world campaign 
against the iraqi leader 
saddams invasion of kuwait could backfire against him in any 
number of ways all of them enhancing israels security 
forcing him to withdraw would clip his wings although officials 
are reluctant to discuss hypothetical situations a military 
collision with iraq conceivably could lead to his ouster and a 
drastic change in the security situation in the middle east

nasa plans to roll columbia back to the launch 
pad late this week and prepare the space shuttle for an early 
september liftoff that will put americans back in orbit for the 
first time since april 
at a news conference tuesday nasa associate administrator 
william lenoir said the agency is so confident about the repair of 
a hydrogen leak on columbia that it has canceled plans to make an 
additional test for the leak 
were back on track and more or less are in our normal 
operating scheme lenoir told reporters 
he said a new plumbing connection called an umbilical has been 
placed on columbia and engineers believe this has eliminated the 
hydrogen leak 
meanwhile scientists working with the hubble space telescope 
said tuesday they are getting closer to a complete description of 
the focusing flaw that has crippled the 15 billion spacecraft 
the national aeronautics and space administration has not 
launched a space shuttle since april launch attempts of columbia 
and of atlantis were scrubbed after hydrogen leaks were discovered 
on the craft the leaks forced the agency to ground the shuttle 
fleet until engineers found the source of the leaking hydrogen and 
corrected the problem 
lenoir said tests of columbias leaky umbilical determined that 
hydrogen was escaping from seals near two valves the flawed 
umbilical was replaced with new hardware from endeavour a space 
shuttle now being built 
tests showed that the leak on atlantis was not in the valve 
seals but in another place in the maze of pipes that carry liquid 
hydrogen lenoir said this means he said that the leaks were 
from two separate problems and did not indicate a design or 
manufacturing weakness in the shuttle system 
atlantis still on the launch pad at the kennedy space center in 
florida will be rolled back to the hangar for repairs late this 
week columbia will take its place on the launch pad and be 
prepared for a liftoff on sept 4 or 5 lenoir said 
nasa earlier had announced plans to test columbia for leaks by 
pumping liquid hydrogen into the shuttles fuel tank a similar 
test on atlantis led to discovery of its leak in june 
but lenoir said columbia now will be tested for leaks only as 
the shuttle is being fueled for launch he said that even if a 
special test detected a leak in columbia it could not be fixed in 
time for a mission in september 
nasa engineers have to spend much of september preparing for the 
oct 5 launch of space shuttle discovery and its payload the 
ulysses space probe 
the ulysses which is destined to go into a polar orbit of the 
sun can only be launched during a planetary alignment of the earth 
and jupiter that occurs once every 13 months 
the purpose of columbias mission is to carry into orbit an 
array of astronomy instruments a sevenman crew will use the 
instruments to study the stars during a nineday flight 
atlantis had been scheduled to fly a secret military mission 
that flight has yet to be rescheduled the current schedule calls 
for atlantis to fly a science mission in november and for columbia 
to fly a space laboratory mission in december 
regarding the hubble problem mission scientist ed weiler said 
nasa engineers expect by labor day to understand enough about the 
focusing problem to start the grinding of eight corrective lens for 
a replacement camera now being built 
an instrument called the wide field planetary camera will be 
installed in the hubble during a space shuttle flight in 1993 
corrective optics in the camera will compensate for the flawed 
focus in the primary mirror of the telescope 
weiler said scientists are taking a series of pictures with the 
camera now on board hubble and that by analyzing these pictures 
experts should be able to draw up a prescription for the corrective 
optics on the new camera 
he said with this schedule the replacement camera could be 
ready in time for a space shuttle repair mission to the orbiting 
hubble by january 1993

numbed by terror and loss kuwaiti 
refugees are telling of desperate attempts to escape the iraqi 
assault wave and of invaders killing people who tried to stop them 
from entering private homes 
but the refugees appear to be finding some solace in the 
generosity shown by leaders of neighboring persian gulf states 
one refugee 7yearold fahd said iraqi soldiers had forced 
their way into his familys kuwait city home and made them turn 
over everything they owned 
ghanem alasimi who worked at kuwait international airport 
described how iraqi troops were beating up people stealing cars 
and forcing drivers to stop shooting them if they disobeyed 
asimi and others kuwaitis spoke tuesday in the cafeteria of a 
hotel in bahrain to which they had fled after thursdays invasion 
everybody was hysterical he said we kept getting calls 
from friends saying that a few families who tried to stop iraqis 
from entering their homes were shot dead 
the bulk of refugees who made it out were those who fled south 
on the first and second days of the invasion before the iraqis 
stretched their forces along the borders more recent arrivals 
slipped through the desert 
in dubai the capital of the neighboring united arab emirates a 
number of europeans said tuesday that they had sneaked across the 
kuwaiti desert to safety pushed by a general desperation and a 
fear of food shortages in kuwait 
jeremy upton a 28yearold briton said iraqi artillery hitting 
targets in kuwait city persuaded him he had to go for it fast 
i was looking north to the city and about 15 miles away saw 
the shells hitting he said it was probably the palace and 
that really brought it home 
upton a shipping company employee grabbed his 2yearold 
daughter hannah and his kuwaiti wife ashmahan alabdul hadi and 
fled 
leaving behind all personal belongings they jumped into a small 
jeep and drove 840 miles to saudi arabia and on to dubai on the 
southern persian gulf 
helena von schantz a 31yearold stockholm native and her 
electronics engineer husband mikael wiberg fled by car with their 
daughter and son and a german technician 
they left kuwait shortly after sunrise sunday driving to 
bahrain from abu halifa a southern suburb of kuwait city 
it was safer to risk our lives this way than remain behind 
said mrs von schantz said food supplies were beginning to run 
out in kuwait 
the soldiers in our area seemed almost apologetic and 
uncomfortable about having invaded kuwait but soldiers near the 
border were different exuding a feeling of power she said 
the kuwaitis and other nationals who escaped their occupied 
oilrich kingdom have been greeted warmly bytheir southern 
neighbors 
in the united arab emirates the government is paying the hotel 
bill of 800 kuwaitis who arrived there each was given more than 
500 on arrival 
kuwait had a population of some 18 million of which more than 
60 percent were foreigners when the invasion was launched about 
half the population was reportedly out of the country escaping the 
gulfs burning summer 
saudi arabias king fahd has issued orders to consider all 
kuwaitis guests of the kingdom according to official sources 
reached by telephone from bahrain saudi banks were ordered tuesday 
to purchase kuwaiti dinars from cashstarved kuwaitis at a higher 
rate than the plummeting market value after the iraqi invasion 
in addition kuwait airways has started operating out of the 
eastern saudi city of dhahran 
the sources estimated the number of refugees from kuwait now 
inside the kingdom at about 40000 they include the emir sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah who was spirited to saudi arabia in the 
first hours of the invasion 
the emir has apparently taken up residence in an opulent palace

vice president dan quayle was discussing drug 
control and economic development today with the new president of 
peru a country the bush administration considers laggard in the 
drive against cocaine 
president alberto fujimori who took office only 11 days ago is 
looking for development aid as he tries to repair a collapsing 
economy 
but quayles message was expected to be that without strong 
antidrug measures by peru congress wont approve the kind of aid 
the country needs 
it was the second stop on quayles mission to the three nations 
that joined the united states at the cartagena colombia drug 
summit last feb 15 in bogota colombia on tuesday the vice 
president said the campaign against illegal drugs is a common 
fight it is a partnership 
quayle went to bogota for the inauguration of colombian 
president cesar gaviria and said his visit symbolized the us 
commitment to work with that government against drugs and for 
expanded trade and development there 
he told gaviria that talks the colombians seek to implement a 
new trade agreement between the two countries will open by the 
first week in september 
in his inaugural address as quayle sat among visiting leaders 
gaviria emphasized that drugconsuming countries must reduce their 
demand for cocaine because the cocaineproducing nations cannot 
solve the problem otherwise 
fujimori has made that point too 
quayle also was meeting in lima with 11 peruvian business 
leaders the topic again was economic development for an economy 
in which inflation has rocketed to over 3000 percent a year 
the vice president was attending a luncheon with peruvian 
officials before heading on to la paz bolivia 
while quayle aides said congress would be the problem in a bid 
for new aid without tough drug measures the administrations own 
office of national drug control policy put it even more sharply in 
a paper on the andean drug strategy 
that account distributed aboard quayles air force jet said 
the united states is monitoring and evaluating drugfighting 
efforts to see whether they justify the provision of additional 
aid next year 
the drug policy office said the situation in peru is the most 
problematic among the three andean countries 
peruvians commonly perceive the economy and the insurgency as 
bigger national issues than narcotics the paper said to date 
peru has demonstrated limited effectiveness in curtailing its 
cocaine industry and its national will to do so remains to be 
demonstrated 
the drug policy office said the andean strategy is designed to 
assist peru by strengthening its institutional will and 
capability to take action against the cocaine industry 
quayle is to meet tonight in la paz with bolivian president 
jaime paz zamora after a final round of meeting in bolivia on 
thursday he flies to haiti and then returns to washington

hitting baghdad where it hurts more countries have 
joined a unsanctioned boycott of oil from iraq and kuwait 
on tuesday countries ranging from powerful japan to neutral 
switzerland to tiny cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort 
to convince the baghdad government to withdraw its troops that 
invaded kuwait on thursday 
turkey announced it was shut down the twin iraqi oil pipelines 
that run through it to the mediterranean carrying half of 
baghdads crude output and cutting off trade with iraq 
baghdads only other major pipelines exporting crude run through 
saudi arabia where the flow has been drastically reduced 
the un security council on monday voted to impose broad 
economic sanctions against iraq for invading small oilrich kuwait 
the measure forbids loans to iraq or kuwait and prohibits any 
activities including the transfer of money that would help the 
two countries export their goods 
sanctions adopted by the european economic community on saturday 
froze iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two 
arab countries more than 90 percent of imports from iraq to the 
12nation eec are petroleum products the eec also suspended arms 
sales to iraq 
switzerland which is not a member of the united nations made 
the unusual move tuesday of joining the un sanctions and banned 
all trade with iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait in addition 
switzerland prohibited all payments and other financial transfers 
to iraq and kuwait 
denmark norway and sweden also announced embargoes on all trade 
with both countries 
japans participation in the un sanctions was seen as 
especially key since tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the 
middle east which supplies much of its petroleum needs japan 
imports 99 percent of its oil 
china joined the un decision to embargo arms sales to iraq 
but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning 
the invasion china sold arms to both iran and iraq during their 
eightyear war and is a major iraqi trade partner 
cyprus sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70 
percent of its oil imports government spokesman akis fantis said 
cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of august 
he said but we are already in the process of taking steps to 
secure alternative sources 
the worldwide closing of ranks against iraqi oil imports is 
likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices which have already 
risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact 
on the world economy 
wholesale oil prices soared to fiveyear highs in new york on 
monday 
france will introduce controls thursday on prices of petroleum 
products to prevent refiners from using iraqs invasion of kuwait 
as an excuse to raise prices acting premier pierre beregovoy 
announced tuesday 
an official with the petroleum association of japan said he was 
unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers 
the official who refused to be further identified said it would 
be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to 
force higher gas prices in japan

an antiwar demonstrator whose legs were 
severed by a navy munitions train has agreed to settle his lawsuit 
against the government and train crew for 920000 his lawyer says 
the settlement is subject to approval by the us justice 
department said attorney thomas steel 
brian willson 49 had sued for personal injuries and civil 
rights violations after his legs were cut off below the knee as he 
sat on the tracks outside the concord naval weapons station in 
1987 he and others were protesting against us weapons shipments 
to central america 
i hope this settlement at least means that the government 
cant use lethal force to stop demonstrators willson said in 
todays san francisco chronicle 
lawyers for the defendants the us government the 
threemember train crew and two supervisors at the concord base 
agreed to the settlement steel said the lawsuit had been set for 
trial sept 10 in federal court 
steel said that under the agreement none of the defendants 
admitted any wrongdoing 
assistant us attorney john penrose who represented the 
government said he was barred by a confidentiality order from 
commenting on the settlement 
willson sued in 1988 after the train crew filed a complaint 
seeking damages for emotional distress they said he intended to 
inflict on them by letting them run over him their lawsuit was 
dismissed earlier this year 
willsons lawsuit claimed the navy had been notified about plans 
to block the train and that the crew could see him far down the 
tracks and had time to stop the train before running into him at 17 
mph more than three times the posted 5 mph limit 
the navy accused willson of causing his own injuries

andrew young came up short in his bid to make history as 
georgias first black governor falling to lt gov zell miller in 
a democratic runoff kansas gov mike hayden survived a scare 
edging a republican primary opponent who blamed him for higher 
property taxes 
dont say that i didnt run a good campaign young the 
former atlanta mayor congressman and un ambassador said tuesday 
night say that zell miller ran a better campaign 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting miller had 576226 
votes or 62 percent young had 352159 votes or 38 percent 
the loser called for party unity and termed miller his former 
opponent but my friend 
zell miller is a peopleperson whom the people of georgia feel 
comfortable with young said they know zell miller better than 
they know andy young 
young 58 had hoped to follow in the footsteps of l douglas 
wilder of virginia who last november became the nations first 
black elected governor 
he finished 12 points behind miller in the primary july 17 after 
a genteel campaign in which race was rarely mentioned for the 
runoff young went on the offensive attacking millers ties to the 
banking industry and resurrecting the label zigzag zell that 
was hung on miller 10 years ago to suggest he changed positions for 
political expediency 
now is the time for reconciliation miller 58 said in 
claiming victory the last two weeks i did not see the andy young 
i had known for the last 20 years but i also can empathize with 
him ive been behind ive lashed out i understand that feeling 
miller whose main issue was support for a state lottery faces 
republican johnny isakson in november democratic gov joe frank 
harris was barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term 
in kansas hayden narrowly defeated real estate executive nestor 
weigand jr the strongest of five primary challengers in an upset 
on the democratic side state treasurer joan finney wrecked former 
gov john carlins hopes of a comeback 
with all precincts reporting hayden had 138025 votes or 45 
percent weigand had 130358 votes or 42 percent and four others 
divided the remainder 
hayden and other republicans were surprised by mrs finneys 
victory 
we certainly dont take her lightly hayden said i look 
forward to an aggressive very straightforward campaign on the 
issues 
weigand a 51yearold businessman with no political experience 
spent his own money freely in a 10week tv blitz he hit hard at 
the 46yearold governors role in property reappraisal and a new 
classification system that many blamed for big property tax 
increases in 1989 
you all have given me more than any candidate could ever 
expect weigand told supporters weve come a long way in the 
last 11 weeks and weve left an indelible mark on kansas 
on the democratic side finney had 80831 votes or 47 percent 
carlin had 79115 votes or 46 percent and minister fred phelps 
had 11612 votes or 7 percent 
i have no regrets over the decision i made to try a comeback 
last october and i have no regrets over the race i ran carlin 
said 
mrs finney said she attributed her victory to a desire by the 
people to regain control of their government and have some fiscal 
responsibility 
the longtime treasurer ran a shoestring campaign raising only 
about 50000 and few political observers gave her any chance she 
received no major newspaper endorsements 
carlins private life may have cost him votes he divorced twice 
while he served as governor from 1979 to 1987 and his second wife 
drew unfavorable attention by trying to raise money for a swimming 
pool at the executive mansion while the kansas economy was in 
trouble 
here are highlights of other voting tuesday 
michigan republicans picked state sen john engler to challenge 
gov james blanchard and rep bill schuette to take on sen carl 
levin both incumbent democrats seek third terms engler won 87 
percent of the vote against general motors engineer john lauve 
while schuette defeated lawyer clark durant 62 percent to 38 
percent 
missouri rep richard gephardt the house majority leader 
easily captured the democratic nomination for an eighth term 
claiming 82 percent of the vote against nicholas f clement a 
newspaper carrier who is a follower of extremist lyndon larouche 
kansas sen nancy kassebaum had no trouble gaining the gop 
nomination for a third term piling up 87 percent of the vote 
against political unknown gregory walstrom the victor in the 
democratic senate primary was former rep bill roy who tried too 
late to remove his name from the ballot and still outpolled 
political newcomer dick williams of wichita 57 percent to 43 
percent

the persian gulf crisis has put turkey in 
a delicate spot testing both its allegiance to nato and the west 
and its commitment to friendly ties with its volatile arab and 
moslem neighbors 
secretary of state james a baker iii arrives thursday and 
there is speculation the united states wants to enlist turkeys 
military against iraq 
turkey which considers itself a bridge between europe and asia 
has been feeling the pull of both east and west more than ever as 
it tries to take a balanced position in the aftermath of iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
turkey doesnt want to isolate itself from the united states and 
western europe by refusing to take strong punitive action against 
neighboring iraq 
it is hoping for admission to the european community which has 
taken a tough line against iraq but predominately moslem turkey 
also fears provoking the wrath of iraq and angering moslem 
fundamentalists who value arab solidarity 
the dilemma was most evident in the way ankara dealt with the 
twin pipelines that carry iraqi oil through turkey to a terminal on 
the mediterranean coast 
turkey came under immediate pressure from the united states to 
shut down the pipelines but turkey refused to act unilaterally 
before long iraq shut down one of the pipelines itself and reduced 
the capacity of the second 
then on tuesday the second pipeline was effectively shut down 
when turkey announced it was banning tankers from loading oil from 
it but turkish officials were quick to stress that the decision 
was taken strictly in line with the oil embargo ordered by the un 
security council on monday 
we were not pressured by anyone said the state minister for 
oil affairs mehmet kececiler 
western diplomatic sources said turkey stood the most to lose of 
any nato country from sanctions against iraq iraq owes turkey 
about 740 million debts which were to be paid off with oil 
purchases turkey was being paid more than 250 million a year to 
service the pipelines 
now that the united states has intervened militarily in the 
crisis turkey may face tough decisions the united states would 
need permission from the turkish government to use bases on turkish 
soil for any operations in the persian gulf 
us officials in washington said tuesday that a multinational 
force including egyptians and morrocans will be deployed in saudi 
arabia to deter an iraqi attack 
turkish foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar said early today 
that turkey had not received any request to join such a force 
there has been speculation that baker will raise military 
options when he arrives for talks with president turgut ozal and 
other officials western diplomatic sources said however that 
baker is coming for broad consultations on overall strategy and 
not on a military mission 
the turkish media has speculated about the presence of 14 us 
f111 figherbombers at the incirlik air base in southern turkey 
the same type of aircraft taking off from bases in britain 
were used in the 1986 us bombing raids against libya 
the us embassy and the foreign ministry said tuesday that the 
planes are on a routine rotation in turkey 
while turkey suddenly finds itself in a prominent position in 
the persian gulf equation only recently the country was wondering 
whether its long strategic role on natos southern flank was 
evaporating with the end of the cold war 
a further sense of isolation from the west came when the 
european community indefinitely put off consideration of turkeys 
bid to join the trading bloc

the justice department is calling for an end 
to the immunity us airlines have from antitrust laws in fixing 
international air fares 
the departments antitrust division made the recommendation 
tuesday in comments filed with the transportation department which 
is considering whether to extend the antitrust immunity for the 
international air transport association 
iatas members who include american and foreign airlines set 
international air fares under an antitrust immunity that the 
organization has enjoyed since 1946 
the federal aviation act allows the granting of such antitrust 
exemptions to further international comity or other foreign 
policy interests 
the justice department urged the transportation department to 
review the immunity on a countrybycountry basis 
immunity for iata appears particularly unwarranted in those 
markets where the involved foreign government does not actively 
support or favor cartel pricing the justice department said 
noting that european common market nations are pushing for 
increased airline competition 
many americans may not realize that the prices of their 
airline tickets for travel abroad are set by what is in effect a 
legalized international cartel attorney general dick thornburgh 
said in a statement 
now that airline deregulation has promoted competition on 
domestic flights there is a strong interest in protecting 
consumers when they travel on us carriers from the united states 
to foreign countries said james f rill assistant attorney 
general for antitrust

2yearold melinda ann garza in 1982

the third 
bovina police chief gary coleman said ms lumbrera told 
authorities one of her former mothersinlaw put a curse on her 
that damned all her children to early death

children and had collected a total of about 15000 for their 
deaths

between 1978 and 1984 grand juries are looking into those deaths 
after the kansas death was questioned authorities in texas

bovina a town of about 1400 people 70 miles southwest of amarillo 
district attorney johnny actkinson would not detail the evidence 
against ms lumbrera

and currency markets 
masashi wakabayashi a trader with yamaichi securities co said 
market players began to pick up underpriced issues following the 
recent drops and adjusted their oversold positions

the energy department says the strategic 
petroleum reserve is ready for use if there is a severe energy 
supply interruption but that it wont be used just to keep prices 
low

reserve now to stop the energy price rise the iraqi invasion 
started but deputy energy secretary henson moore says the reserve 
will not be used to flood the market

international affairs and energy emergencies assured a house panel 
tuesday the agency is ready to use the reserve if necessary 
the oil reserve was established in response to the 197374 arab 
oil embargo and built to its current size at a cost of about 20 
billion which includes the cost of the oil and preparing and 
maintaining the storage site it has been tapped only once when 
congress ordered 2 million barrels auctioned to oil companies in 
1985 
it would take at least 16 days from a presidential request for 
oil to flow from the reserve doe spokesman phil keif said during 
that time bids from oil companies would have to be submitted 
reviewed and chosen

in an inauguration ceremony ringed by 
tight security cesar gaviria became colombias youngest president 
and called for more international help in fighting his countrys 
drug war 
helicopter gunships circled the city antiaircraft guns were 
aimed at skies over the presidential palace where the inauguration 
took place tuesday and thousands of troops backed by armor 
patrolled the streets 
no country in the history of humanity has paid such a high 
price as colombia in confronting international crime said 
gaviria a demure 43yearold economist and former treasury 
minister 
drug trafficking is the main threat against our democracy we 
will fight it without concessions said gaviria who took office 
for a fouryear term succeeding president virgilio barco 
the new president called on industrialized countries to lower 
trade barriers to boost colombian exports which would give more 
colombians an alternative to participating in the drug trade 
gaviria was catapulted to his nations highest office a year ago 
when the thenleading presidential hopeful luis carlos galan of 
the governing liberal party was murdered by drug traffickers 
that sparked a war between the government and powerful cocaine 
lords that has left hundreds of people dead 
gaviria who had served as galans campaign manager became a 
candidate after the assassination during the campaigning for mays 
elections two other presidential candidates were also murdered at 
least one of the slayings was linked to drug lords 
during tuesdays ceremonies gaviria his wife two young 
children and visiting presidents were seated behind bulletproof 
glass 
gaviria appealed to the united states which consumes most of 
the cocaine smuggled out of colombia to implement recently 
announced policies that would favor his countrys exports 
its not direct economic aid or military assistance we need 
most its fair treatment its free trade gaviria said 
he called on developed countries to attack cocaine consumption 
within their borders 
gaviria cautioned that extradition of suspected traffickers to 
the united states the fate the drug lords here fear most cannot 
be the only weapon or the main strategy in colombias fight against 
the cocaine cartels 
but he didnt rule out continued extraditions in the last year 
colombia has extradited 22 trafficking suspects to the united 
states and has 15 more waiting to be be extradited 
the presidents of venezuela argentina ecuador and haiti 
attended the ceremonies which were held outdoors under rainy skies 
alongside the presidential palace 
vice president dan quayle took the occassion to try to build 
solidarity for world sanctions against iraqs saddam hussein for 
his invasion last week of kuwait 
saddam husseins invasion of kuwait cannot stand will not 
stand quayle told a news conference in bogota after meeting with 
gaviria 
quayles security personnel took no chances with the vice 
presidents safety several of his muscular bodyguards wearing 
dark sunglasses patrolled the bogota airport and searched through 
journalists bags 
quayle flew from the airport to an army base in a helicopter 
accompanied by four other blackhawk helicopters armed with missiles 
despite an apparent ceasefire declared by colombias 
billionaire drug traffickers last month authorities did not 
discount the possibility of terrorism 
in the past year drug traffickers have been blamed for 
exploding some 300 bombs killing about 500 people 
in his remarks gaviria promised to further peace talks 
currently under way with leftist guerrillas open up the political

picnics flashlight marches and 
neighborhood visits from police marked this years national night 
out a 7yearold effort to get people more involved in preventing 
crime 
around the country people were urged to turn on their porch 
lights and sit outside after dark tuesday new york mayor david 
dinkins attended a rally in harlem and fort lauderdale fla 
police chief joe gerwins went to 10 events 
its a sad time in the life of this city when little children 
cant sleep in their parents homes without risking death from a 
bullet coming through the window said dinkins referring to a 
recent rash of child slayings in his city its a sad time an 
angry time a time to come together and fight back 
dinkins pledged 250000 for neighborhood grants to provide 
activities for young people and 950000 more for community 
crimeprevention programs but spending a lot of public money 
wasnt the theme of the evening 
night out founder matt peskin said the cost of keeping a 60watt 
light in front and behind the average house at night is just 32 a 
year but a big step toward getting a criminal or vandal to move on 
when it started in 1984 the night out was mostly people sitting 
in front of their homes with the lights on but folks quickly began 
to throw block parties and invited the police as a way to get to 
know neighborhood officers 
barbara landers held a party in philadelphia 
the block is running over with people she said we got to 
introduce people to each other and let them know that theres

police today would not say whether the attack was believed to be a 
political assassination 
pedro mendez 50 was shot three times monday night as he walked

wallet and other valuables when police found him said police 
spokesman fred weiner

the new york chapter of the colombian liberal party which is 
considered the leading opponent of colombias drug lords 
the leader of the party cesar gaviria trujillo was inaugurated 
president on tuesday 
its possible the drug cartels killed him to assert their 
power with the new president isnt it coincidental that he was 
killed on the eve of gavirias inauguration said mendezs 
brother hector 
police spokeswoman sgt tina mohrmann would not comment on 
whether the attack was believed to be politically motivated

a mirror design flaw in a new 1 billion series 
of weather satellites could delay their launch and leave 
forecasters standing in front of blank screens the new york 
times reported today 
the flaw is in mirrors meant to reflect images from the 
satellites telescopes the newspaper said citing federal 
officials and experts the problem is that the mirrors warp when 
heated as sunlight would do in outer space 
the trouble is another blow to nasa which is supervising the 
satellites construction the space agency already is reeling from 
problems with its shuttle fleet and a defective mirror on its 15 
billion hubble space telescope 
the two mirror problems are technically unrelated the times 
said 
officials said they have no estimate of how much it will cost to 
correct the satellite mirror problem or how long the launch of the 
first advanced satellite might be delayed it is scheduled for 
1992 but the times said unofficial estimates put the delay at 
anywhere from two months to more than a year 
james r greaves nasa program manager for meteorological 
satellites said the scary aspect is that the nation is now 
down to one working advanced satellite 
if that fails weather people are going to be standing in 
front of blank screens he said 
the united states also has planes radar and other satellites 
that contain forecasting equipment but only this type of satellite 
gives a comprehensive view of the weather situation at any instant 
the fiveyear lifetime of the current advanced satellite which 
beams the weather pictures used in newspapers and on television 
ends in february 1992 although it might last longer 
elbert w friday jr head of the national weather service said 
that loss of advanced satellite coverage would constitute a 
national emergency with significantly less capability for making 
forecasts and tracking hurricanes and other storms 
the five new satellites are being built by ford aerospace under 
nasa supervision at a cost of 1 billion greaves said the mirrors 
had been built correctly by the applied optics corp according to 
itt corp specifications

rubyred mulberry jam made from fruit 
grown near the hanford nuclear plant has been sent to energy 
secretary james watkins and gov booth gardner 
they should have no problem recognizing the gifts theyre 
labeled radioactive do not eat 
two scientists said they made the jam during the weekend from 
mulberries gathered along the banks of the columbia river beside 
the hanford complex in southcentral washington they say the jam 
is contaminated with strontium 90 a deadly isotope present in 
radioactive fallout 
oceanographer norm buske and his wife mathematician linda 
josephson said they wanted to alert state and federal officials 
that contamination of vegetation near the closed n reactor could 
pose a safety hazard 
battelle pacific northwest laboratories which has been 
contracted by the government to monitor the plant said researchers 
have known for years that vegetation in no trespassing areas 
near the reactor is contaminated 
strontium 90 has not been reported in mulberries before but 
its been documented in other vegetation in the area for several 
years said battelle pacific spokesman jerry holloway 
the isotope is a byproduct of nuclear weapons production and was 
knowingly and legally released around the riverside n reactor he 
said 
buske and his wife who operate an independent laboratory about 
75 miles northeast of the reservation said they were concerned 
that strontium 90 is present in edible plants accessible by boat 
the isotope travels through underground springs to the river buske 
said 
the jam which buske said was shipped monday by federal express 
arrived at the governors office tuesday said dick milne 
gardners press secretary it was not known if watkins office 
received the jam 
the mulberry jam with the little extra something has been 
sent to a state radiation lab for further analysis milne said 
the jams contents were not revealed to federal express buske 
said 
under federal standards the jam contains 80 to 90 times the 
strontium 90 levels allowed in daily consumption in drinking water 
buske wrote in an accompanying letter but the jam would only pose 
a minimal risk if it was eaten he said 
the couple also gathered curly dog an edible green along the 
riverbank which is posted with no trespassing signs but opted 
not to deliver it because it could be harmful if handled 
this is not a hollow exercise buske said we are 
convinced that some of their radiation pathways are dangerous to 
the public 
most of the plutonium used in us nuclear weapons was made at 
the 600squaremile plant near richland wash it is considered the 
most severely polluted site in the federal weapons complex 
technology to handle some of the hottest radioactive wastes does 
not exist 
the full cleanup is expected to take more than 30 years and cost 
more than 100 billion

the crash diet that gave oprah winfrey her svelte 
new figure does not permanently lower the bodys metabolism a 
study says 
many people have worried that crash dieting permanently lowers a 
persons metabolism the rate at which the body at rest burns 
calories making it harder and harder to shed more pounds and to 
keep the weight off 
today a study in the journal of the american medical 
association found that the optifast liquid diet caused womens 
metabolism to plunge but it rebounded after they began eating 
normal food the study was funded in part by optifast 
the diet helped the women lose almost 50 pounds in four months 
the study said 
the good news is that the study showed dieting when combined 
with exercise does not result in a longterm reduction in 
metabolic rate said lead researcher thomas a wadden the bad 
news is that its still a struggle to maintain weight loss 
wadden associate professor of psychology at the university of 
pennsylvania school of medicine and clinical director of its 
obesity research group said in a telephone interview tuesday that 
for every 25 pounds of weight loss a dieter must eat 100 fewer 
calories a day than in prediet days to maintain the loss 
wadden also is a consultant to the sandoz nutrition co maker 
of optifast miss winfrey shed 67 pounds on the optifast diet 
the study compared nine women who went on the 420calorieaday 
optifast program with nine women who went on a diet of conventional 
food totaling 1200 calories a day 
the metabolism of the optifast women dropped 22 percent over 16 
weeks when they were consuming only the liquid diet while the 
metabolism of the others fell about 13 percent 
metabolism rates of the optifast group rose to within 11 percent 
of initial rates during the following six weeks when the women 
were gradually switched from to about 1100 calories of normal food 
a day the study found 
metabolism in the 1200calorie group rose to within 86 percent 
of original levels during that period 
exercise walking up to 20 minutes at a time three times a 
week was an important part of the program for both groups said 
wadden 
were not sure why that is he said it may have some 
longterm effect on metabolic rates more importantly it simply 
burns up calories 
over the entire 48 weeks of the study women in the optifast 
group lost about 48 pounds each women on the 1200calorie diets 
lost about 40 pounds each subjects weighed an average of 216 
pounds at the beginning of the study 
dr peter d vash assistant clinical professor of medicine at 
the medical school of the university of california at los angeles 
said the study will not be news to researchers in the field 
i concur with dr waddens conclusion that diet will not 
adversely permanently affect the metabolic rate he said in a 
telephone interview 
vash emphasized that such extremely lowcalorie diets are 
appropriate only with proper supervision and only for the obese 
optifast which costs about 3000 and requires at least a years 
commitment is supervised through hospitals

a former bodyguard of winnie 
mandela was sentenced to death today for murdering a 14yearold 
black activist who had been kidnapped and held at mrs mandelas 
house 
supreme court justice brian odonovan rejected arguments from 
the defense that 37yearold jerry richardsons desire to gain mrs 
mandelas favor was a mitigating factor in the killing 
it is difficult to see how kidnap and murder can be mitigated 
by the desire to please anybody said odonovan 
he also sentenced richardson to 18 years imprisonment for 
kidnapping assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and 
attempted murder 
james stompie seipei moeketsi was found stabbed to death in 
january 1989 after richardson led him away from mrs mandelas 
house in the black township of soweto 
according to the testimony stompie was accused of being a 
police informer 
black leaders later criticized the group surrounding mrs 
mandela saying they had engaged in a reign of terror in soweto 
and that the community should shun mrs mandela 
she began to reappear at antiapartheid rallies a few months 
before her husband nelson mandela deputy president of the african 
national congress was released from prison in february 
odonovan said the evidence indicated mrs mandela was at her 
home at the time of the beatings 
mrs mandela has not been charged in the case and declined a 
request by richardsons lawyers to testify on his behalf her 
driver and other associates are scheduled for trial on kidnapping 
and assault charges in september 
only richardson was tried for stompies murder 
president f w de klerk suspended all hangings in february but 
courts still have the option of imposing the death sentence in 
murder cases when the judge finds there are no mitigating factors

a heart valve manufacturer bowed to the 
demands of consumer activists and agreed to inform thousands of 
implant patients of potential defects 
shiley inc of irvine a subsidiary of new yorkbased pfizer 
inc said tuesday it will identify and notify 21000 patients in 
the united states of product defects that could prove dangerous 
its notices will advise patients about the warning signs of 
mechanical valve failure and what steps to take should the device 
fail company officials said 
the announcement affects those patients who received the 
bjorkshiley 60degree convexoconcave heart valve the company 
voluntarily pulled the valves from the us market in 1986 
following reports of valve fractures 
roger sachs vice president and medical director at shiley said 
the firm was determining how patients will be notified he said 
shiley was negotiating with another company to compile a registry 
of implant patients 
the decision comes after public citizen health research group a 
washington dcbased consumer organization filed a lawsuit 
against shiley and pfizer to force shiley to warn patients about 
the defects 
a judge dismissed the suit in may after ruling that the us 
food and drug administration had sole authority to issue such an 
order 
if the company does what it says it is going to do there is 
no question that some people who otherwise would die will live 
said public citizens director dr sidney wolfe 
i think they shiley saw the handwriting on the wall and 
yielded to something they should have done a long time ago he 
added 
originally shiley had cautioned only surgeons about the valves 
problems replying upon them to notify their patients 
in march the company mailed warnings to surgeons 
cardiologists primary physicians and emergency room practitioners 
a statement issued tuesday by shiley said the decision to notify 
patients directly came in response to fda concerns that physicians 
may not have effectively communicated the products defects to 
implant patients 
shiley officials added they will ask the fda to review the 
notices it will send to patients 
fda spokeswoman susan cruzan said the agency could decide by 
early next year whether to require valve manufacturers to notify 
patients directly of any potential product defects

president bush didnt mention adolf hitler or 
world war ii today in his speech on the iraq crisis but they 
clearly were on his mind as he described saddam hussein and the 
tactics needed to stop him 
as in the case of the 1930s we see in saddam hussein an 
aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors bush said 
twice we have seen what his promises have meant his promises 
mean nothing the president said apparently referring to 
thursdays invasion of kuwait and saddams offer friday to withdraw 
his troops 
appeasement does not work bush said 
if history teaches us anything it is that we must resist 
aggression or it will destroy our freedoms he said this is 
not an american problem or a european problem or a middle east 
problem it is a world problem

here is the text of president bushs address 
wednesday on the iraq crisis 
in the life of a nation were called upon to define who we are 
and what we believe sometimes these choices are not easy but 
today as president i ask for your support in a decision ive made 
to stand up for whats right and condemn whats wrong all in the 
cause of peace 
at my direction elements of the 82nd airborne division as well 
as key units of the united states air force are arriving today to 
take up defensive positions in saudi arabia i took this action to 
assist the saudi arabian government in the defense of its homeland 
no one commits americas armed forces to a dangerous mission 
lightly but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation 
and exhausting every alternative it became necessary to take this 
action 
and let me tell you why less than a week ago in the early 
morning hours of august 2nd iraqi armed forces without 
provocation or warning invaded a peaceful kuwait facing 
negligible resistance from its much smaller neighbor iraqs tanks 
stormed in blitzkrieg fashion through kuwait in a few short hours 
with more than 100000 troops along with tanks artillery and 
surface to surface missiles iraq now occupies kuwait 
this aggression came just hours after saddam hussein 
specifically assured numerous countries in the area that there 
would be no invasion there is no justification whatsoever for this 
outrageous and brutal act of aggression a puppet regime imposed 
from the outside is unacceptable the acquisition of territory by 
force is unacceptable no one friend or foe should doubt our 
desire for peace and no one should underestimate our determination 
to confront aggression 
four simple principles guide our policy 
first we seek the immediate unconditional and complete 
withdrawal of all iraqi forces from kuwait 
second kuwaits legitimate government must be restored to 
replace the puppet regime 
and third my administration as has been the case with every 
president from president roosevelt to president reagan is 
committed to the security and stability of the persian gulf 
and fourth i am determined to protect the lives of american 
citizens abroad 
immediately after the iraqi invasion i ordered an embargo of 
all trade with iraq and together with many other nations 
announced sanctions that both froze all iraqi assets in this 
country and protected kuwaits assets the stakes are high iraq is 
already a rich and powerful country that possesses the worlds 
second largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms 
its the fourth largest military in the world 
our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes and 
could face a major threat to its economic independence much of the 
world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more 
vulnerable to iraqi threats we succeeded in the struggle for 
freedom in europe because we and our allies remain stalwart 
keeping the peace in the middle east will require no less

were beginning a new era this new era can be full of promise 
an age of freedom a time of peace for all peoples but if history 
teaches us anything it is that we must resist aggression or it 
will destroy our freedoms appeasement does not work as was the 
case in the 1930s we see in saddam hussein an aggressive dictator 
threatening his neighbors 
on 14 days ago saddam hussein promised his friends he would not 
invade kuwait and four days ago he promised the world he would 
withdraw and twice we have seen what his promises mean his 
promises mean nothing 
in the last few days i have spoken with political leaders from 
the middle east europe asia and the americas and i have met with 
prime minister thatcher prime minister mulroney and nato secretary 
general woerner and all agree that iraq cannot be allowed to 
benefit from its invasion of kuwait 
we agree that this is not an american problem or a european 
problem or a middle east problem it is the worlds problem and 
thats why soon after the iraqi invasion the united nations 
security council without dissent condemned iraq calling for the 
immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troops from kuwait 
the arab world through both the arab league and the gulf 
cooperation council courageously announced its opposition to iraqi 
aggression japan the united kingdom and france and other 
governments around the world have imposed severe sanctions the 
soviet union and china ended all arms sales to iraq and this past 
monday the united nations security council approved for the first 
time in 23 years mandatory sanctions under chapter 7 of the united 
nations charter 
these sanctions now enshrined in international law have the 
potential to deny iraq the fruits of aggression while sharply 
limiting its ability to either import or export anything of value 
especially oil 
i pledge here today that the united states will do its part to 
see that these sanctions are effective and to induce iraq to 
withdraw without delay from kuwait 
but we must recognize that iraq may not stop using force to 
advance its ambitions iraq has massed an enormous war machine on 
the saudi border capable of initiating hostilities with little or 
no additional preparation given the iraqi governments history of 
aggression against its own citizens as well as its neighbors to 
assume iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic 
and therefore after consulting with king fahd i sent secretary 
of defense dick cheney to discuss cooperative measures we could 
take following those meetings the saudi government requested our 
help and i responded to that request by ordering us air and ground 
forces to deploy to the kingdom of saudi arabia let me be clear 
the sovereign independence of saudi arabia is of vital interest to 
the united states 
this decision which i shared with the congressional leadership 
grows out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship 
between the united states and saudi arabia us forces will work 
together with those of saudi arabia and other nations to preserve 
the integrity of saudi arabia and to deter further iraqi 
aggression through their presence as well as through training and 
exercises these multinational forces will enhance the overall 
capability of saudi armed forces to defend the kingdom 
i want to be clear about what we are doing and why america does 
not seek conflict nor do we seek to chart the destiny of other 
nations but america will stand by her friend the mission of our 
troops is wholly defensive hopefully they will not be needed 
long they will not initiate hostilities but they will defend 
themselves the kingdom of saudi arabia and other friends in the 
persian gulf 
we are working around the clock to deter iraqi aggression and to 
enforce un sanctions im continuing my conversations with world 
leaders secretary of defense cheney has just returned from 
valuable consultations with president mubarak of egypt and king 
hassan of morocco

president bush today said he will ask other 
oilproducing nations to replace embargoed iraqi and kuwaiti oil on 
world markets and explore whether to dip into the nations 
strategic reserves to bolster supplies 
the president also asked americans to conserve energy and called 
on oil companies to do their fair share and try to hold the 
line on prices 
bush did not name the countries he planned to call on to 
increase production the president of venezuela said tuesday his 
nation would try to increase production according to an official 
traveling with vice president dan quayle who met with the 
venezuelan leader 
bushs sanctions against iraq for invading kuwait include a 
trade embargo that bans import of either iraqi or kuwaiti oil 
although supplies are said to be high prices for gas and other 
petroleum products have increased in the days since the invasion 
prompting criticism from congress and administration officials 
im asking the oil companies to do their fair share bush 
himself a former oilman said in his nationally televised address 
from the oval office conservation measures also can help the 
president said americans everywhere must do their part 
bush said he and the leaders of other nations boycotting iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil were exploring whether it would be necessary to 
draw from oil reserves 
in the meantime bush said he was asking all producing nations 
to do what they can to increase production in order to minimize 
the effect of the boycott 
on tuesday the energy department said the strategic petroleum 
reserve is ready for use in the event of severe oil shortages but 
would not be used just to keep prices low 
some in congress have called on bush to tap the reserve to push 
prices back down 
the oil reserve was established in response to the 197374 arab 
oil embargo and built to its current size at a cost of about 20 
billion which includes the cost of the oil and preparing and 
maintaining the storage site it has been tapped only once when 
congress ordered 2 million barrels auctioned to oil companies in 
1985 
it would take at least 16 days from a presidential request for 
oil to flow from the reserve energy department spokesman phil keif 
said during that time bids from oil companies would have to be 
submitted reviewed and chosen

secretary of state baker has consulted with his counterparts in 
many nations including the soviet union and today he heads for 
europe to consult with president ozal of turkey a staunch friend 
of the united states and hell then consult with the nato foreign 
ministers 
i will ask oil producing nations to do what they can to increase 
production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reductions 
will have on the world economy and i will explore whether we and 
our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves 
conservation measures can also help americans everywhere must do 
their part 
and one more thing im asking the oil companies to do their 
fair share they should show restraint and not abuse todays 
uncertainties to raise prices 
standing up for our principles will not come easy it may take 
time and possibly cost a great deal but we are asking no more of 
anyone than of the brave young men and women of our armed forces 
and their families and i ask that in the churches around the 
country prayers be said for those who are committed to protect and 
defend americas interests 
standing up for our principles is an american tradition as it 
has so many times before it may take time and tremendous effort 
but most of all it will take unity of purpose 
as i have witnessed throughout my life in both war and peace 
america has never wavered when her purpose is driven by principle 
and on this august day at home and abroad i know she will do no 
less 
thank you and god bless the united states of america

the jury in marion barrys drug and perjury 
trial resumed deliberations today after refusing to reveal its 
verdict on one of the 14 counts 
on tuesday the mayors lawyer conceded for the first time that 
barry may be convicted on some counts 
jury foreman edward eagles sent a note to us district judge 
thomas penfield jackson late tuesday indicating the jury had 
reached a verdict on count 12 jackson said 
that count stems from the testimony of former carter 
administration aide doris crenshaw who said that she and barry had 
snorted cocaine together in her washington hotel room between nov 
7 and nov 10 1988 
have you reached a verdict jackson asked eagles 
i would prefer that you poll the jury the foreman replied 
after a moment jackson asked whether the jury wanted to reveal 
its decision 
not at this time said a woman juror a male juror shook his 
head 
jackson then dismissed the panel of nine women and three men for 
the day after answering a routine evidentiary question 
deliberations resumed this morning 
the panel last thursday began deliberating the 14 charges 
against barry three felony counts of perjury one misdemeanor 
count of conspiracy and 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession 
meanwhile chief defense attorney r kenneth mundy speculated 
tuesday that barry could be convicted on some counts 
youre going to get some hung counts some acquittals 
you might get one or two convictions mundy said my opinion is 
theyve passed the perjury and hes going to be 
acquitted of those counts 
allen palmer a former federal prosecutor who now works as a 
criminal defense attorney speculated that eagles declined to 
reveal the jurys decision because one or more jurors became 
uncertain about their conclusion 
obviously someone was a little shaky in their resolve during 
the 20 minutes or so it took to assemble people in the courtroom 
palmer said in an interview 
one or two people indicated to the foreman that they may not 
be willing to go along with their prior vote he theorized 
thats why the foreman wanted the judge to ascertain from the 
jurors themselves what their individual votes were 
the maximum penalties for conviction on all 14 criminal charges 
against the mayor are 26 years in prison and 185 million in 
fines under federal sentencing guidelines however any sentence 
would be far less than the maximum 
the defense has acknowledged the mayor was an occasional user of 
cocaine but has contended the government has not proven charges 
concerning use at specific times and places 
witnesses at the trial testified that barry snorted and smoked 
cocaine and smoked opium and marijuana some 200 times 
thirteen witnesses said they saw barry use cocaine between 1983 
and last january when the mayor was videotaped by the fbi smoking 
crack three other witnesses said they saw barry smoke marijuana 
admitted cocaine dealer lydia pearson said she sold crack to the 
mayor about 25 times in a threemonth span

former prime minister benazir bhutto 
said today the army had threatened to impose martial law as a way 
of forcing the president to dismiss her 20monthold government 
on monday president ghulam ishaq khan dissolved ms bhuttos 
government citing widespread corruption among senior officials 
misuse of power and the failure to control ethnic violence in her 
home province of sindh he named a caretaker government and called 
for elections on october 
the presidents speech was prepared by the military 
headquarters ms bhutto claimed at a news conference that 
charge has been denied by both the military and ishaq khan 
the caretaker government is temporary she added within a 
few weeks the army will take over 
an army spokesman said ishaq khan had consulted the army chief 
of staff gen mirza aslam beg before making his decision to 
dismiss the government but he denied the president was pressured 
by beg 
it was in the offing for a very long time the army 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity even they 
ms bhuttos government were aware of it 
he also rejected ms bhuttos claim that the military was 
considering the imposition of martial law 
the spokesman said with tensions high on the border with 
neighboring india the army would be unable to declare martial law 
and deploy large numbers of troops to patrol in cities 
ms bhuttos critics and even members of her own pakistan 
peoples party said she had been warned repeatedly to reform her 
government 
ms bhutto told reporters she had no differences with the army 
until may when disputes emerged over the conflicts in neighboring 
afghanistan and in kashmir the disputed territory divided between 
india and pakistan 
until may there were no differences between me and gen beg 
but when the process of repatriation started major differences 
developed she said 
ms bhutto claimed the army opposed the repatriation of 38 
million afghan refugees living in pakistan saying it would give 
legitimacy to the sovietbacked government in kabul that 
ussupplied guerrillas have been fighting to overthrow 
ms bhutto also claimed the army wanted to go to war with india 
over kashmir where a moslem uprising for independence from mainly 
hindu india has claimed more than 900 lives since late january ms

secretary of state james a baker iii and 
mexican foreign secretary fernando solana joined forces today in 
condemning the iraqi conquest of kuwait and demanded an immediate 
withdrawal of iraqi forces 
the occasion was a gathering of more than 150 american and 
mexican officials including nine cabinet members from each side 
to discuss such issues as energy supplies drug trafficking and 
immigration 
one us official said the assemblage constituted perhaps the 
largest bilateral discussion in diplomatic history the meetings 
are held annually under the auspices of the mexicous binational 
commission 
minutes after president bush addressed the nation on the persian 
gulf crisis baker stood before the delegates and condemned iraqs 
outlaw act of blatant illegal aggression 
baker reaffirmed the administrations call for the immediate 
withdrawal of iraqi forces and the return of kuwaits legitimate 
government 
in a similar vein solana said mexico condemns the iraqi 
invasion 
we call for the immediate withdrawal of the invading troops 
he said 
shortly after the opening ceremony ended baker headed for 
turkey for consultations on the gulf crisis 
the iraqi invasion added a new dimension to this years 
mexicanamerican conclave because of the destabilizing impact its 
having on the price and supply of oil worldwide 
mexico exports about half of its 25 million barrel daily 
production of oil and stands to benefit substantially from the 
recent sharp increases in oil prices 
it was expected the two sides would discuss the possibility of 
an increase in mexicos production capacity in the event of a 
significant drop in the international supply of oil 
in his remarks baker said completion of a freetrade agreement 
and continued progress in the war against narcotics trafficking are 
two of the major challenges the united states and mexico face 
he said cooperation in combatting the drug trade has been better 
this year than at any time in history 
for his part solana said mexico is willing to multiply its 
economic contacts with the united states we believe that a fair 
freetrade agreement would be a major step in that direction 
solana touched only briefly on the drug issue in his remarks 
according to us officials the priority mexico has given to 
the issue is reflected in increased cocaine seizures an estimated 
12000 kilos 26500 pounds over the last six months most as a 
result of joint mexicanamerican operations 
in addition mexico is pleased that the united states is 
increasingly accepting mexicos view that the us government 
should do more to reduce demand for narcotics

iraqi state television declared today 
that kuwait is part of iraq and called for full unity between 
kuwait and iraq 
the statement stopped short of saying iraq has annexed kuwait 
but strongly suggested that iraqi president saddam hussein has no 
intention of giving up the emirate which his troops seized in a 
lightning raid on thursday 
our fellow citizens history has proved that kuwait is a part 
of iraq said the statement read by an unidentified announcer 
in order to make our banners the banners of freedom and 
unitywe are appealing for all iraqiswe are appealing to all 
principles of honor to go with their heroic leader saddam 
hussein the announcement said 
the statement also called for arab unity in the face of outside 
threats an apparent reference to a multinatinal force being sent 
to saudi arabia 
earlier iraqi radio had said there would be an important 
announcement today fueling speculation that baghdad intended to 
say it had annexed kuwait 
the statment came less than two hours after president bush told 
the american people that us troops were taking up defensive 
positions in oilrich saudi arabia to guard against a possible 
attack by iraq

lawmakers today praised president bushs 
decision to send us combat forces to saudi arabia to deter 
further aggression by iraqi president saddam hussein whose troops 
overran neighboring kuwait last week 
but members of congress cautioned that the united states should 
not go it alone in protecting other arab nations and us oil 
interests in the persian gulf region 
its important that this be a joint operation i hope other 
arab states can get involved rep ike skelton dmo a senior 
member of the house armed services committee said in a telephone 
interview 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash stressed during a 
campaign swing for democratic candidates in georgia that it would 
be important if we could obtain greater and greater international 
cooperation and coordination in these efforts not only on the 
ground but in terms of any potential blockade 
the international support is important i think to american 
public feeling that were not in this alone and that we represent a 
broader concern foley said in an interview on nbcs today 
show

president hosni mubarak of egypt today denied us reports that 
his country has agreed to send troops to join the multinational 
force to defend saudi arabia and other threatened states in the 
middle east 
mubarak made the comment in a nationally televised speech in 
which he did not rule out sending egyptian troops as part of an 
arab force 
earlier today britain announced it would join the multinational 
military effort to help prevent iraq from expanding its invasion 
us officials in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity had said on tuesday that egypt and morocco close allies 
of the united states had agreed to send troops to join the 
usled multinational force 
but both countries today denied those reports 
the question of egypts and moroccos participation in the force 
is important because saudi arabia reportedly has insisted that 
other arab nations join with the united states in sending troops to 
counter iraq 
egypt has a large arsenal of ussupplied weapons and is the 
secondlargest recipient of us economic and military aid 
currently receiving 23 billion a year since 1981 the united 
states has conducted biannual joint maneuvers with egypt 
but mubarak said intervention by foreign troops could worsen the 
crisis which began thursday when tens of thousands of iraqi troops 
overran kuwait then massed along the saudi border 
we have no troops there in saudi arabia we are not 
preparing troops and there is no talk about this mubarak said 
but if we are asked to participate with arab troops i do not 
think egypt would refuse he said 
mubarak called for an emergency arab summit within 24 hours and 
offered to hold it in egypt shortly before iraq invaded kuwait 
mubarak had tried to ease tensions between the two countries and 
had thought he had succeeded 
i call for an urgent arab summit within 24 hours it would be 
better than having a solution forced on us by foreign powers the 
egyptian leader said 
egypts middle east news agency reported that saudi arabia 
algeria libya tunis morocco jordan oman yemen and syria had 
agreed to attend the summit there were no details on when the 
proposed summit would be held 
mubarak said he had no personal knowledge that foreign powers 
would strike iraq but said he feared such an attack was coming 
i have told our brothers in iraq i am afraid that iraq will 
be struck by a harsh strike from the outside dont think that the 
fleets are just going to sit there sleeping mubarak said of 
naval forces being sent to the region by the united states france 
and britain 
morocco also indicated today that it was not willing to join the 
multinational force the official moroccan news agency map quoted 
an official source as saying we deny all military 
participation in the force 
moroccos king hassan ii receives millions of dollars a year in 
us military aid the moderate arab country has usmade tanks 
there was hope that a multinational defense of saudi arabia 
would deter president saddam husseins millionman iraqi army from 
crossing the border and seizing the kingdoms rich oil fields 
secretary of state james a baker iii made plans to meet friday 
in brussels with the foreign ministers of the 15 us allies in 
europe after a quick consultation trip to turkey the move appeared 
to be an effort to enlist western europe in the saudi defense 
effort 
the announcement by british foreign secretary douglas hurd today 
that britain would participate in the multinational force followed 
a conversation between prime minister margaret thatcher and saudi 
arabias king fahd 
hurd said the saudis asked for british help and britain was in 
contact with the united states and other allies on the best 
contribution it could make 
he said it was too soon to specify which forces britain would 
send but he added we are essentially talking about naval and 
air forces 
also today spain and italy agreed to let the united states used 
bases on their territory to help transport us troops and 
equipment sent to gulf 
france has said it has not been asked to take part in the 
multinational force and that participation was not envisaged at 
this stage 
turkey which closed twin iraqi oil pipelines to the 
mediterranean on tuesday also was not asked to join such a force 
said turkeys foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar 
bonn today signaled readiness to allow the us military to use 
american facilities in west germany as a basis for operations 
for soldiers headed to saudi arabia to defend that nation against 
iraq 
but the west german government said late tuesday that there were 
no plans for german troops to join the multinational force noting 
that the west german constitution bars the use of german troops 
outside the country 
taizo watanabe spokesman for the japanese foreign ministry 
also said his countrys constitution would bar it from joining any 
international military effort in the persian gulf 
defense secretary dick cheney returned to washington today after 
visiting saudi arabia egypt and morocco in a twoday trip to drum 
up support for us pressure on iraq he met with king hassan in 
morocco on tuesday 
a handful of british and french navy vessels were also in the 
region a soviet foreign ministry spokesman said a soviet 
antisubmarine ship and destroyer were dispatched from the indian 
ocean toward the area but only to ensure safety of navigation of 
soviet civilian vessels 
diplomats said the un security councils resolution monday 
ordering an international trade embargo against iraq could be used 
as justification by the united states and other nations to act 
unilaterally or in concert apart from the united nations to 
enforce the boycott

president bush announced today that us 
troops were taking up defensive positions in oilrich saudi 
arabia to guard against a possible attack by iraq they will not 
initiate hostilities but they will defend themselves he said 
at least 5000 ground troops were involved along with 140 
sophisticated fighters and bombers and naval supply ships 
according to government sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity cruise missiles programmed to hit specific iraqi sites 
were aboard a battleship that set out on a weeks journey to the 
middle east 
in a televised oval office address bush sharply condemned iraqi 
aggression in invading kuwait last week he demanded immediate 
unconditional and complete withdrawal and the restoration of the 
kuwaiti government to power 
the president conceded that the saudi defense mission may take 
time and be costly and said he would consider tapping the 
nations strategic petroleum reserves to assure a ready supply of 
oil he called on the oil companies not to engage in unnecessary 
price hikes to take advantage of the international uncertainty and 
urged that other oilproducing nations boost production 
bush committed american forces as the second part of an 
international effort to force an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait the 
united nations voted earlier in the week to impose a complete trade 
embargo against iraq and bush and other world leaders have been 
considering how to implement the sanctions including a possible 
naval blockade 
bush described the makeshift saudi defense force as a 
multinational one but he did not identify the participants 
and there was considerable confusion about its makeup egypt and 
morocco denied they were involved 
the reaction from iraq was defiant state television declared 
that history has proved that kuwait is a part of iraq 
one pentagon official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the nations military leadership was settling in for what 
could be a lengthy operation 
this whole thing isnt easy you dont deploy forces and they 
suddenly show up in another part of the world there are a hell of 
a lot of logistical problems that go into moving people around the 
world particularly in the extreme conditions of the middle east 
he said 
members of congress offered immediate backing for the 
presidents moves said house speaker thomas foley i think the 
people and the congress will support him 
expressions of concern blended with support democratic rep les 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee said the 
nation was in for a couple of very very tense days 
the president provided no estimate of the number of troops 
involved in the saudi deployment deliberately so according to 
pentagon sources who said bush did not want to tip off iraq 
us sources had said eqypt and morocco would participate in the 
multinational force but only britain said it would take part 
we have no troops there said egyptian president hosni 
mubarak we are not preparing troops and there is no talk about 
this but if we are asked to participate with arab troops i do not 
think egypt would refuse 
the uss wisconsin departed tuesday night on a weeklong voyage 
for the mediterranean sea armed with 32 tomahawk cruise missiles 
programmed with targeting information about specific iraqi 
positions the sources said 
it would escort the carrier saratoga to the mediterranean two 
other carriers are in the region along with their escort ships 
the president continued his diplomatic maneuvers as the military 
deployment unfolded 
white house officials said bush was meeting during the day with 
kuwaits ambassador in a gesture that reflected continuing american 
support for the exiled kuwaiti government 
secretary of state james a baker was departing for turkey and a 
later visit to brussels for a meeting with nato leaders on friday 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said turkey was seeking 
compensation of as much as 2 billion in exchange for shutting down 
the iraqi oil pipeline that crosses its territory 
there is no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and 
brutal act of aggression bush said of iraq and its leader 
saddam hussein a man he described as an aggressive dictator 
threatening his neighbors 
a puppet regime imposed from the outside is unacceptable the 
acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable no one friend 
or foe should doubt our desire for peace and no one should 
underestimate our determination to confront aggression 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition of not being 
identified said army units heading for saudi arabia included 
elements of the 82nd airborne division from fort bragg nc the 
24th division mechanized from fort stewart ga and the 101st 
airborne division from fort campbell ky the 82nd and the 101st 
make up the 18th airborne corps 
as well several marine supply ships based at the supersecret 
us facility on the island of diego garcia have set sail for the 
region the sources said 
this first movement is of light infantry and airborne troops 
but these ships have the heavy tanks m1a1 abrams and m60s that 
are needed for heavyduty ground fighting the source said 
the source said the tomahawk cruise missiles would overmatch the 
frenchmade exocet missiles that iraq has used so successfully in 
other conflicts 
sources said navy supply ships have departed guam the strategic 
pacific island base manned with 8000 us airmen and sailors for 
the arabian sea to back up the independence and the eisenhower 
carriers

the providence ri journalbulletin on iraqkuwait 
let us hope that anyone who believes history ended with the 
decline of the cold war is aware of the iraqui invasion of kuwait 
this remarkable event has come as a shock but no surprise 
president saddam hussein of iraq had been hinting about such action 
for some time and had bullied kuwait with the threat of force at 
the recent opec conference in geneva 
president bush has vowed that the united states will take 
whatever steps necessary to defend american interests in the 
persian gulf 
we take president bushs comments to mean that oil supplies to 
the west will not be interrupted and we trust that he will not 
hesitate to guarantee those supplies if this means a resumption of 
our earlier policy of reflagging and escorting tankers in danger 
then that earlier policy should be swiftly resurrected

the registerguard eugene ore on iraqkuwait 
iraq has a huge army massive debts and ambitions that are out 
of proportion to its size at its doorstep lies kuwait a virtually 
undefended country with 2 trillion worth of oil in retrospect 
its surprising that iraq waited until now to grab its rich little 
neighbor 
iraqs invasion has also confirmed that its president saddam 
hussein is one of the worlds most dangerous men under his 
leadership iraq has launched an eightyear war against iran used 
chemical weapons more extensively than any nation since world war 
i attempted to buy nuclear weapons triggers on the international 
black market and threatened israel with annihilation 
now with kuwaits resources at his disposal hussein controls 
20 percent of the output of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries putting him in a position to cause economic mischief on 
a global scale 
iraq must be forced back within its borders but armed force 
particularly american military intervention should not be the 
instrument the united states does not have enough at stake to 
justify a war with iraq over kuwait 
hussein is undeterred by world opinion he will however 
respond to economic pressure 
president bush has already cut off trade with iraq frozen iraqi 
funds and protected kuwaiti assets in the us from iraqi seizure 
other countries should respond with sanctions of their own the 
soviet union and france iraqs two main suppliers of military 
equipment have a special responsibility to end arms shipments 
japan and western europe the main consumers of iraqi oil should 
seek supplies elsewhere oil exporters in the mideast and elsewhere 
should increase production to facilitate the boycott

orange coast daily pilot costa mesa calif on iraqkuwait 
its time to act like a superpower 
the united states needs to use its military force to dislodge 
iraq from its occupation of kuwait and to cripple the millionman 
renegade iraqi army 
the reason is simple other methods of retaliation are too 
risky from all accounts iraqi leader saddam hussein is the hitler 
of the 1990s the butcher of baghdad a madman who wants to rule 
the middle east 
if we put an international economic knife to husseins throat 
he might lash out in defense remember this is a man who has built 
a third world country into a firstrate military power liberally 
used chemical weapons in his war with iran and some analysts fear 
may have a nuclear surprise up his sleeve 
why sweat an outlaw like this 
the united states has spent 300 billion per year to build up 
its military lets put it to use as iraqi troops sit just 
miles from the saudi arabia border the time for the us to draw 
the line has passed hussein obliterated the line as soon as his 
army crossed the border of kuwait 
the world community has unanimously condemned iraq for its 
lightning takeover of kuwait we encourage the united states to 
lead the world and bring this outlaw country to justice

the brainerd minn daily dispatch on justice marshall 
supreme court justice thurgood marshall made malicious 
comments concerning president bushs nomination of david souter to 
replace justice william brennan on the court 
in an interview on abc television the 82yearold justice 
scoffed at souter as a nobody who couldnt hope to fill the shoes 
of brennan an esteemed liberal 
but marshalls pique didnt end there he also blasted the 
president its said that if you cant say something good about 
a dead person dont say it marshall said of bush well i 
consider him dead 
this statement is not only shockingly rude but also totally 
inappropriate from the mouth of a supposedly dignified supreme 
court justice the fact that he has a lifetime appointment and is 
largely insulated from public scrutiny doesnt excuse such 
callousness

athens ohio messenger on sampls and student loans 
the savings and loan scandal is actually having one beneficial 
sideeffect it is making washington nervous about the federal 
governments vast and miscellaneous liabilities 
federal insurance on thrift deposits is the reason the public 
must pick up the tab for hundreds of insolvent sampls around the 
country the cost to the taxpayers 300 billion over 30 years 
but deposit insurance is only one form of public guarantee 
numerous other programs shift risk and potential losses from 
private parties to the citizens at large the administration is 
starting to take a close look at the publics exposure in areas 
like home mortgages farm credit and that perennial invitation to 
abuse student loans 
federally guaranteed student loans worth 13 billion will be 
made this year those loans help millions of young people pay for 
college or vocational training unfortunately they also line the 
pockets of con artists who set up flybynight trade schools that 
exploit unsophisticated often semiliterate clients and feed off 
federal loans 
the default rate just 9 percent at fouryear colleges averages 
40 percent at forprofit trade schools loan deadbeats are costing 
taxpayers 2 billion this year 
together these agencies will have more than 1 trillion in 
liabilities outstanding by 1991 the taxpayers reeling from the 
savings and loan bailout have a right to insist that these 
enterprises be financially sound

children riding in the back of pickup trucks risk 
severe injury and death even if the vehicle is not involved in a 
crash researchers report 
the study in todays journal of the american medical association 
examined data on 290 children up to age 14 who had been injured or 
killed in pickups from 1980 to 1989 in orange county calif 
the researchers found that 24 percent of those injured in the 
back of the truck were hurt in noncrash events such as a sudden 
stop or turn compared with 9 percent of those in the cab 
and 47 percent of the children riding in the back were injured 
when ejected from the vehicle while only 11 percent of those 
riding inside were ejected the researchers said 
the ultimate goal should be a legislative intervention 
eliminating travel in the back of a pickup truck where no 
opportunity for restraint exists wrote the authors led by dr 
phyllis f agran of the university of california at irvines 
pediatrics department 
it goes against every principle of child safety that you could 
imagine said dr mark widome chairman of the american academy 
of pediatrics committee on injury and poison prevention 
the authors noted that national highway traffic safety 
administration statistics show that in 1987 127 children under age 
20 were killed nationwide while riding in the back of pickups 
about 1000 children were injured in such instances that same year 
the authors said 
in 1989 103 youths aged 21 and under died while riding in 
pickup beds federal statistics show 
only eight states have measures restricting travel in the back 
of pickups said the studys authors

taking a tablet containing antibiotics after sex 
can give women who suffer frequent urinary tract infections a 
reprieve from that common and frustrating problem researchers 
report 
such an approach is better than taking the same antibiotics 
daily or three times a week to prevent infections since continual 
antibiotic therapy can be costly and can promote 
antibioticresistant bacteria the researchers reported in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
the drugs they used in a new study trimethoprim and 
sulfamethoxazole marketed in combination under the trade names 
bactrim and septra seem to work regardless of how often a woman 
has sex the researchers said 
the drugs also are highly effective in women who use diaphragms 
for contraception an important finding since diaphragms have been 
blamed for contributing to urinary tract infections in sexually 
active young women 
the researchers compared 16 infectionprone women who took the 
antibiotics after sex with 11 similar women who were given an inert 
drug the women were an average of 23 years old and each had 
suffered at least two urinary tract infections in the previous year 
only two of the 16 women taking antibiotics developed infections 
during the 180 days of the study compared with nine of the women 
taking placebos the researchers were led by dr ann stapleton of 
the department of medicine at the university of washington in 
seattle 
the infection rate in study subjects who took antibiotics after 
sex 03 per patientyear compares favorably with rates reported 
previously for patients who took the same drugs daily or three 
times per week zero to 015 infections per patientyear the 
researchers said 
taking antibiotics after intercourse is something many 
physicians already prescribe for such women but the seattle study 
is the first scientific support for the strategy 
it is an important study even though the idea is not new 
dr arieh bergman chief of gynecology and urology at the 
university of southern california womens hospital said in a 
telephone interview tuesday from los angeles

asahi shimbun tokyo on iraqkuwait 
there are mounting international calls for economic sanctions 
against iraq as a result of its invasion of kuwait more than 
anything else we wish to see the conflict resolved in the united 
nations from the standpoint of the kuwaitis whose country has been 
invaded 
there were not a few cases where economic sanctions invoked in 
the cold war years tended to become halfbaked and did not function 
in an effective manner given this tendency japan used to be 
rather passive on economic sanctions 
having an increasingly bigger say in the world community japan 
ought to extricate itself from its conventional passive posture of 
following other countries and act positively so that economic 
sanctions against iraq may be effective 
the best option for making economic sanctions effective is to 
respond to the iraqikuwaiti situation in an imperturbable manner 
instead of being carried away by immediate market trends

iraq has destroyed peace in the region 
there is little doubt that turkey should not enter into 
deplorable actions on behalf of the superpowers but on these days 
when a vacuum has been created in the region couldnt turkey 
raise its voice a bit louder and make it heard by the masses 
calling for law and justice 
it must be admitted that iraq has committed this very unjust 
action extremely successfully and gotten the highest grade 
neither the cia nor the kgb nor anyone else had the slightest idea 
of what was going to happen but iraq may get used to that 
turkey must place its helmet and top hat of diplomacy on the 
table and think about it

sovetskaya rossiya moscow on iraqkuwait 
the conflict in relations between iraq and kuwait erupted more 
than a fortnight ago when baghdad accused kuwait authorities of 
exceeding opec production quotas and thereby bringing down world 
prices of oil and harming the iraqi economy 
but the roots of this bloody conflict go much deeper they lie 
in the hegemonistic nature of the iraqi leaderships foreign policy 
over the past decade 
tensions in the persian gulf continue unabated this as the 
soviet government justly said in its statement is directly at odds 
with the interests of arab countries means extra obstacles to 
settling conflicts in the middle east and runs counter to positive 
trends of recovery in the international economy

the guardian london on iraqkuwait 
frustration in the gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of 
task forces and tactical bombing but the military option is no 
option at all the emergence of a potential hostage problem of vast 
dimensisons only emphasized that this is far too vast a crisis for 
gunboat diplomacy loose talk of carpetbombing baghdad should 
be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable 
scenarios 
for the west to use force now would only compound its enormous 
historical error which has allowed the monster we helped create to 
thrive nothing would do more to convince the arab world that 
saddam husseein is the nasser of the 90s and nothing would more 
quickly undermine the new harmony of the postcold war world than 
unilateral action by the united states and its allies

straits times singapore on trinidad and tobago 
the coup attempt in trinidad and tobago is to some extent a 
manifestation of a nations unhappiness with grinding poverty and a 
worsening economy exploiting this the rebels claimed that 
they staged the coup because of government corruption and austerity 
measures whether or not they are to be believed corruption at the 
highest level and further economic pain through austere and 
necessary measures are the ingredients that could turn a 
contented people against their government 
what made matters worse in trinidad and tobago was that the 
frustration also took on a religious and racial slant moslems 
mainly converts form six percent of a population which is 
predominantly christian 
another sinister aspect of this highly combustible situation was 
the allegation that some of the rebels were trained in libya 
dubbed by many western governments as a sponsor of terrorism if 
libya did indeed help pull the trigger then clearly trinidads 
troubles have far wider implications especially for small 
countries who suffer from a triple dosage of economic woes and a 
racial minority which is also a religious minority

jakarta indonesia post on normalizing relations between china 
and indonesia 
as we begin to conduct full diplomatic relations with china in 
the continuously changing setting of the asiapacific region 
therefore we must from the outset have a clear vision and retain 
concrete ideas of what the actual purposes of maintaining such 
relations are 
although we will be developing our bilateral relations with 
china on different levels trade culture sports science and 
technology and so forth we should prevent ourselves from 
developing sentimental views that could fog our clear view on the 
aspirations of china as a major asian power 
that is why it is important to convey to china in no uncertain 
terms and precisely at this initial stage of normal diplomatic 
relations that the efforts to restore peace in cambodia have by 
now become a crucial test case of whether it has the intention of 
playing a constructive role in southeast asia 
certainly the majority of countries in the world as well as we 
in indonesia find it difficult to understand how a major power 
such as china persists in using such a despicable group as the 
khmer rouge as its policy instrument on mainland southeast asia 
in that fundamental sense the resumption of normal diplomatic 
relations between indonesia and china could have a 
beneficial impact on the stability and the dynamic development of 
east asia

trouw amsterdam netherlands on liberia 
the end of the liberian president samuel doe is near although 
he himself doesnt seem to think so with a few hundred faithful 
followers he has barricaded himself in his palace in the besieged 
capital monrovia and feels strengthened by his belief in 
juju the magic powers that should make him invincible 
doe did not turn out to be the champion of emancipation of 
suppressed natives he established a new ethnic supremacy of 
his krahn tribe over other ethnic groups under his corrupt rule 
the country was impoverished 
but the americans stayed they had economic interests rubber 
maintained the radio station voice of america and an important 
military communication center and the monrovian airport was of 
military significance 
it would be nonsense to say that the americans bear guilt for 
the current violence in liberia but washington could have 
protested earlier against does misbehavior and it could have 
thrown in its economic and political power 
now the european community and the united states have distanced 
themselves from the violence of doe and from the rebels who are 
fighting him 
not siding with the rebels is nice 
but waiting until things get better is the worst position 
possible tens of thousands of refugees are floating into the ivory 
coast and other povertystricken neighboring countries help has to 
be given there efforts of westafrican countries to mediate in 
order to break through this deadlock merit support 
however the most important thing is that it is made clear to 
the victors in this horrible conflict from the start and in 
every possible way that human politics pay and draconian politics 
do not

the american bar associations policymaking body 
today withdrew its formal support of abortion rights heeding a 
plea from a majority of members who took part in an earlier forum 
here 
the abas house of delegates by a vote of 200188 approved a 
socalled neutrality proposal to repeal its prochoice policy 
adopted in february 
the vote followed nearly two ours of spirited at times 
impassioned debate over an issue that has divided the nations 
largest lawyers group as have few issues in its history 
supporters of the prochoice stance vowed to fight on and said 
future aba conventions could be dominated by the abortion issue 
nobody here has the illusion were going to put our tails 
between our legs and go home said estelle rogers of washington 
dc a leader of those who wanted the aba to remain on record in 
support of abortion rights 
anthony palermo of rochester ny who led the drive for 
repeal said he hoped the matter now is resolved it would be a 
grave mistake if we kept dominating each meeting with this issue 
he told reporters 
during the debate among the delegates sally determan of 
washington dc urged rejection of the repeal resolution 
adopting it she said would send a signal the aba was abandoning 
its support of womens right to choose to control our own 
bodies and was bowing to a wellfinanced campaign by a vocal 
minority 
barbara howard of cincinnati said she supported the repeal 
proposal because views on abortion reflect deeply held individual 
religious and moral beliefs 
abortion is not a legal issue she said its a political 
issue a moral issue 
lawyers attending the abas assembly on monday voted 885836 to 
urge the delegates to rescind the february policy abortion 
opponents joined forces with those who support neutrality to 
narrowly approve the recommendation 
neither side said it had any plans for a referendum on the issue 
among all 360000 aba members nationwide 
the split within the aba was underscored by two speakers today 
its new president john j curtin jr of boston and his designated 
successor sandy dalemberte of tallahassee fla 
curtin urged repeal dalemberte pleaded with his colleagues to 
stand fast behind the prochoice policy which he said defends 
the principle of liberty 
i am forced to ally myself with one set of friends against 
another curtin said 
on tuesday he told a news conference the issue has caused 
wounds within the aba he hopes to help heal 
regardless of the outcome of todays debate curtin said 
there will be some disappointed people and ill speak to the 
healing process were not a singleissue organization 
curtin had said he would refuse to sign any legal briefs in 
which the aba advocates abortion rights if the prochoice stance 
were retained 
palermo in urging repeal of the february policy said if 
current policy is not altered the aba will be accurately portrayed 
as an advocate of one extreme position in the debate thus 
forfeiting its potential role as a constructive arbiter of the 
debate 
mondays assembly 12th graf pvs 
mondays assembly vote was open to any of the 12000 association 
members attending this weeks annual convention who paid a 250 
registration fee 
the resolution adopted by the house of delegates in february 
said government should not interfere with the confidential 
relationship between a pregnant woman and her physician in 
deciding on abortions 
the policy prompted criticism by some who said it creates an 
impression the aba may be biased when it decides whether to support 
judicial nominees 
but curtin said tuesday that the aba will continue to evaluate 
judicial appointees including supreme court nominee david h 
souter based on competence integrity and judicial temperament 
more than 1500 members have quit the aba since february in 
protest over the prochoice stance costing the association about 
300000 in annual fees

water use by 10 percent the water bureau said it will have to ask 
residents to further cut their water use if the situation worsens

long drought in the summer of 1987

family and friends of three defendants in the 
central park jogger case walked out of the courtroom this morning 
as a prosecutor told the jury the teens were guilty of raping and 
nearly killing the woman 
the closing argument by assistant district attorney elizabeth 
lederer was interrupted about 10 minutes after it began when a 
dozen of the defendants supporters stood up and left 
lederer continued speaking imploring the jury to convict yusef 
salaam 16 raymond santana 15 and antron mccray 16 in the 
april 19 1989 brutalization of the jogger during a gang rampage 
through central park 
these three youths had gone into the park with 30 or more 
people they went to rob people to beat people and to assault 
people and that is what they did they robbed beat and assaulted 
anyone they could catch lederer said 
lederer made reference to the courtroom appearance of the woman 
who authorities said was beaten bludgeoned raped and left for 
dead by her assailants 
the fact that she could even come to this courtroom is a 
miracle the jogger will never be the same as she was 
lederer said 
the jury was expected to begin deliberations later today 
defense lawyers made their final appeals to the jury on tuesday 
with one attorney suggesting the victim was not gangraped and 
others accusing detectives of lying about how admissions were 
obtained from the three defendants 
robert burns lawyer for salaam said in closing statements that 
unanswered questions raise doubts about whether she was raped 
nobody in his right mind would dispute the seriousness of her 
injuries said burns but this brave young lady did not and 
cannot shed any light on what happened to her on april 19 1989 
burns said semen found inside the joggers body did not match 
that of the three defendants her boyfriend or any person known to 
prosecutors 
how can one conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the sperm 
found inside her arose out of the criminal assault burns asked 
salaam santana and mccray are accused of raping and nearly 
killing the jogger and assaulting two male runners in the north end 
of central park 
they are on trial in state supreme court in manhattan on charges 
of attempted murder rape sexual abuse riot assault and robbery 
the 30yearold woman is back at work as a vice president at 
salomon brothers investment bankers but she testified that she 
still suffers from impaired sight balance and smell as a result of 
the attack 
the principal evidence against mccray and santana are statements 
they gave police salaam did not give police a statement but a 
detective testified he took notes of admissions salaam made during 
questioning 
all the lawyers said police lied on the witness stand about how 
the admissions were obtained 
michael joseph mccrays lawyer charged that detectives used 
threats and promises to extract statements from his client 
peter rivera santanas lawyer told the jury raymond was not 
involved in any way shape or form in the events he confessed to 
burns also criticized prosecutors for putting the jogger on the 
stand and for showing the jury color photographs of her injuries 
i believe the district attorney has made an attempt to appeal 
to your emotions burns told the jury when the prosecutor 
waves all those ghastly pictures at you those are attempts to 
catapult you into a spirit of vengeance

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference wednesday on the iraq crisis 
bush terry 
q mr president how many american troops have you sent to 
saudi arabia how long are you committed to keeping them there and 
why not use them to drive iraqi forces out of kuwait 
bush there will be a military briefing at the pentagon i think 
its within an hour and so i will leave the numbers to them i 
would expect there would be some reluctance to give out specific 
numbers at this point for very obvious reasons what was the last 
part of your 
q the other parts sir were how long will you keep american 
forces in saudi arabia and why not use them to drive the iraqi 
troops out of kuwait 
bush well as you know from what i said theyre there in a 
defensive mode right now and therefore that is not the mission 
to drive the iraqis out of kuwait we have economic sanctions that 
i hope will be effective to that end and i dont know how long 
theyll be there they just got there are just getting there 
q is this an openended commitment i mean could this drag on 
for years 
bush nothing is openended but im not worrying about that 
there at all im worrying about getting them there and doing what 
i indicated in our speech in there is necessary the defense of the 
saudis and the trying through concerted international means to 
reverse out this aggression 
q mr president are we in a war and what other nations have 
agreed to join our forces in defending saudi arabia and i take it 
you also have included other gulf nations in that umbrella 
bush were not in a war we have sent forces to defend saudi 
arabia other nations i will leave announcements about what other 
nations will be participating to the saudis but i believe margaret 
thatcher after talking to king fahd has announced that forces 
will be going in and then i think youll see other such actions 
but id much prefer to leave that to saudi arabia who indeed 
its their country 
q but was cheneys mission successful in rallying support with 
egypt and morocco 
bush well i i having talked to mubarak a couple of times 
myself feel that we are in very close agreement with him who was 
your other country you asked about 
q morocco yemen 
bush morocco very very supportive of the saudis and of our 
overall position on the mideast so theyre i was very pleased 
with the cheney mission in that regard brit 
q mr president there are several dozen americans in baghdad 
apparently not able to leave inaudible and perhaps hundreds more 
in kuwait and perhaps elsewhere in iraq as well in view of the 
extreme political sensitivity of americans toward this whole 
question of hostages why should not saddam hussein feel that he 
holds very high cards now in dealing with the united states 
bush well ive been encouraged that there had been have been 
actually announcements i believe saying people were free to 
leave so im not going to speculate or hypothecate beyond that i 
want to see them out of there obviously but what he does thats a 
bit unpredictable but im not going to heighten tensions in this 
regard by responding to hypothetical questions that might go beyond 
your question 
q well what i just wonder what assurances you might be able 
to provide so that our policy in this instance will not become as 
it has in the past hostagedriven

be sent by sea to monrovia from freetown sierra leone most of the 
troops would be from nigeria earlier reports had said nigeria was 
planning to airlift 500 soldiers to monrovia 
johnson had said the hostages would not be freed until the

the 7month civl war to oust president samuel doe 
johnson said his forces would attack the marines if no troops 
came some 5000 people mostly civilians have been killed in the

the united states or other african nations said johnson if 
they dont intervene i will attack the american marines

troops would be deployed soon in monrovia babangida said he hoped 
they would meet no resistance but added that they would be prepared

evacuate all americans who can reach the embassy in monrovia the 
us government also has agreed to evacuate some other foreign 
nationals 
ms tutwiler said a representative of johnsons group had 
informed us officials on tuesday that the hostages were all well 
and would not be harmed

most city residents are going along with the 
mayors call for water conservation because of a drought but water 
use is way up at the mayors official residence 
mayor tom bradley has lobbied for a mandatory water conservation 
program that would impose rationing if residents fail to reduce 
their consumption by 10 percent below 1986 levels 
by that standard the mayors official residence getty house 
passes muster during june and july water use at bradleys 
residence was 26 percent below 1986 levels although in april and 
may the decrease was less than 1 percent according to department 
of water and power records 
but compared to last year the faucets at getty house are 
gushing 
water consumption from april through july at getty house was an 
average 2079 gallons per day up nearly 275 percent over the same 
period last year according to the records cited by the daily news 
of los angeles 
city residents cut their water use by 95 percent over the same 
period last year the newspaper reported wednesday 
a bradley spokesman blamed unseasonably high temperatures this 
year and more official receptions at the residence 
the mayor held three times as many receptions this year than 
he did during the same four months last year bill chandler said 
if you know how much water is used at a reception with a hundred 
people its clear where much of the water went 
city councilwoman joan milke flores chairwoman of a council 
committee on water issues said the getty house water bill could 
dampen the mayors credibility on conservation matters 
people look to public officials for good examples flores 
said 
the city council rejected bradleys conservation proposal last 
month in favor of a voluntary plan

bush i can provide only the assurance that i consider the 
protection of american life fundamental to my job and 
responsibilities as president yes 
q mr president the question of chemical weapons there are 
reports that the iraqis were seen loading airplanes with chemical 
weapons how concerned are you that he would use these over our 
troops that are there 
bush well i think any time you deal with somebody who has used 
chemical weapons on the battlefield you are concerned about it 
and i would think that hed know that given the way the world 
views the use of chemical weapons that it would be intolerable and 
that it would be dealt with very very severely so i would hope 
that there would be no use of chemical weapons 
q mr president i am being told in my ear that there is a 
report or a rumor out of jedda that saddam hussein is dead have 
you heard anything of this 
bush ive not heard anything of that 
q do you know if the saudis will do you know if the saudis 
will follow do you know if the saudis are going to follow the 
turks lead in shutting off an iraqi pipeline the one inaudible 
have you had any promises from the saudis or any other 
oilproducing countries that they will increase production to make 
up for this shortfall 
bush well im convinced i believe that the venezuelans have 
announced a significant increase and i expect youd find others to 
follow and what was the first part john 
q are the saudis cutting off the pipeline to inaudible 
bush that matter will be discussed im sure and i know that 
the saudis are fully in accord with the action taken by the united 
nations in terms of chapter 7 sanctions and so i but we have no 
deal with them in that regard 
q sir its difficult for us to get information from saudi 
arabia one reason being the american news media were not permitted 
to accompany american troops into saudi arabia was that your 
decision or king fahds 
bush that decision didnt come to me but theres plenty of 
reporters in saudi arabia right now 
q well do you think there should be a pentagon pool as there 
was for example in panama 
bush well id have to discuss that with the secretary of 
defense im glad that the matter that that many forces could be 
moved with not too much advance warning and with not too much 
therefore risk to saudi arabia or to these troops yeah 
q mr president was there any one single thing that tipped 
your hand into deciding to send us troops and aircraft into saudi 
arabia and secondly how supportive have the soviets been about 
your decision 
bush there was no one single thing that i can think of but 
when king fahd requested such support we were prompt to respond 
but i cant think of an individual specific thing if there was 
one it would perhaps be the saudis sic moving south when they 
said they were withdrawing 
q you mean the iraqis sir 
bush i mean the iraqis thank you very much its been a long 
night moving the iraqis moving down to the kuwaitsaudi border 
when indeed they had given their word that they were withdrawing 
that heightened our concern 
q how supportive have the soviets been to your decision sir 
bush the soviets have been very responsible in my view they 
have joined the united nations on that resolution and jim baker 
as recently as yesterday afternoon or evening was in touch with 
shevardnadze again and you know i cant ask for a more favorable 
response than he received yes jerry 
q mr president is it your intention to let economic pressure 
alone provide the force that drives iraq out of kuwait are you 
prepared to wait several months which is how long it might take 
for the economic sanctions to really bite 
bush well weve taken this first significant step to defend 
saudi arabia the economic sanctions should begin to bite pretty 
soon there will be further steps taken to ensure that they are 
fully effective and then well wait and see where we go from 
there but i have no were not were not im not beyond that 
in my thinking there obviously is a lot of contingency planning 
that always goes on and prudently should go on charles then ann

president bush said today he was encouraged by 
suggestions that 3500 americans in iraq and kuwait may be allowed 
to leave but added that their safety still cannot be assured 
bush told a news conference that one concern was the 
unpredictable nature of iraqi president saddam hussein 
bush spoke after an iraqi airways passenger jet arrived from 
iraq in amman jordan today with more than two dozen americans as 
well as other foreigners a jordanian security official said but a 
us embassy spokesman in amman said he was unaware of any evacuees 
arriving in jordan 
it would be the second commercial flight carrying out foreigners 
stranded after thursdays invasion of kuwait an iraqi airliner 
arrived in cairo tuesday carrying 78 foreigners mostly japanese 
bush told reporters i want to see them the americans out of 
there obviously but what he saddam hussein does thats a bit 
unpredictable 
he said protection of american life was fundamental to my job 
and responsibilities as president 
us officials have been concerned since the iraqi invasion took 
place about the fate of the 3000 or so americans in kuwait and the 
500 in iraq 
the officials spoke of their concerns tuesday as bush ordered 
us troops and combat planes to saudi arabia to protect that 
country against a potential attack by iraq 
while declining to refer to the americans as hostages the state 
department said tuesday they were not being permitted to leave the 
two countries freely 
part of the confusion stems from contradictory signals iraqi 
authorities have been sending concerning whether americans who wish 
to leave will be allowed to do so said the officials who asked 
not to be identified 
a group of americans most of them bused from kuwait to baghdad 
by iraqi authorities were not allowed to leave their hotel in the 
iraqi capital causing some officials to worry about iraqs 
intentions 
it is our hope that circumstances will permit americans to 
depart iraq by road within the next few days and eventually that 
baghdad airport will reopen so that all foreigners may depart 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said this 
depends obviously on the government of iraq opening its borders 
she said assistant secretary of state john kelly raised the 
issue of the americans safety with the iraqi ambassador on monday 
but received no immediate reply 
turkey and jordan both neighbors of iraq are logical 
destinations for americans who want to leave the country by land 
jordanian authorities have promised to help any americans who cross 
into their country by land 
a senior iraqi official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday that iraq is considering allowing foreigners 
including us embassy staff and dependents to leave by land 
through jordan 
ms tutwiler said americans in kuwait have been advised to leave 
the country as soon as possible and a few have managed to leave by 
various routes 
she said it was not clear when americans and other foreigners 
will be allowed to depart freely 
about 39 americans are at the rashid hotel in baghdad many 
taken there by bus from kuwait by iraqi authorities ms tutwiler 
said they have been interviewed by us consular officials and 
appear to be in good shape 
among the 39 is penelope nabokov a 10yearold girl from 
albany calif whose family said she was among 367 passengers 
taken from a british airways jetliner in kuwait while the invasion 
was under way last week the girl was traveling alone from london 
to india where her mother was doing research

a british businessman believed to be the 
first foreigner to travel by road from baghdad to jordan since the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait said wednesday he had no problem 
i just took a taxi and went said bryan hume who manages a 
freight business based in amman 
it was only after he arrived late tuesday after a 19hour 
journey that hume was informed other foreigners had not been 
allowed to leave iraq 
iraq began flying foreigners out later that day the second 
iraqi airways passenger jet arrived in jordan on wednesday carrying 
foreigners a security official reported 
the first iraqi airliner arrived tuesday carrying 78 foreigners 
mostly japanese it was the first commercial flight carrying people 
who were stranded in kuwait and iraq after iraq invaded its 
neighbor 
hume 52 of southampton said he was in erbil in northern 
iraq when iraqi forces invaded kuwait one week ago movement out 
of iraq was barred but the country has since begun allowing 
foreigners to leave 
when i returned to baghdad i spent some time with friends and 
then simply took a cab and asked to be driven to the border it was 
as simple as that he said 
when i arrived at the iraqi border post of rutbah a surprised 
iraqi civilian told me how did you get here foreigners are not 
allowed to leave he said in an interview in his office 
but the iraqi border officials gave me no trouble they 
stamped my passport and waved me on 
hume said he apparently became the first foreigner to cross the 
border after the iraqi government decided to allow foreigners to 
leave 
rutbah is 490 miles west of baghdad and 75 miles east of the 
jordanian border 
hume said it was only after he arrived in amman that he realized 
there was an international crisis everything was perfectly 
normal in baghdad no excitement no fear or anything he said 
of course there is a lot of cheering and patriotic songs on 
iraqi tv he said 
hume said traffic on the desert highway from amman to baghdad 
appeared normal and that there was no military presence on the 
highway 
meanwhile a jordanian airport official said a preliminary 
passenger list listed eight french citizens and 32 britons on the 
flight that arrived in amman on wednesday 
he said some americans also were aboard the boeing 747 jetliner 
but a us embassy spokesman said he was unaware of any american 
evacuees aboard the plane

q mr president i can understand the need for individual 
countries to announce their own attentions with regards to the 
multinational force but its our understanding that the saudis 
wanted an arab component in that force is that in fact the case 
and will there be one 
bush they didnt tell us that but it would not be at all 
surprising if there was an arab component in that force not at all 
q but you do not have one at this point 
bush well im not going to comment on on because i think 
announcement of all components really should come from the 
participating countries yeah ann 
q not even broader to define it as arab if not by nation 
bush no i told you i wouldnt be surprised if that happened 
but i think that id much prefer to have that the announcements 
of that come from others this i think it is important that the 
focus be on saudi requests and on the defensive nature of the move 
weve made with these forces yes ann 
q mr president youve told us several times of saddam 
husseins lies in his dealings with other leaders and with the 
united states on his intentions why do you now believe the iraqi 
governments statements that they will let americans go if there 
are no if there is no evidence of an american being let go 
bush im not sure i totally believe them i hope theyre 
telling the truth 
q do you have assurances from any intelligence source any 
other source that indicates movement by those americans or any 
bush well ive had a source of movement by some foreigners so 
i would hope that this would then apply to americans yes 
q mr president you said in your speech this morning that the 
puppet regime in kuwait was unacceptable and so was the 
acquisition of territory at the same time though you said that 
the that the deployments are wholly defensive the question is 
how do you actually expect to force hussein to withdraw from kuwait 
bush economic sanctions in this instance if fully enforced 
can be very very effective it is a rich country in terms of oil 
resources theyre a poor country in a sense because he 
squandered much of the resource on military might and there are 
some indications that hes already beginning to feel the pinch and 
nobody can stand up forever to total economic deprivation yes 
q if i could follow that up if i can just follow real 
quickly could you will you rule out preemptive strikes against 
iraq 
bush i am not going to go into hypothetical situations weve 
been very careful not to do that and im simply not going to 
respond maureen and then well go to the aisle 
q mr president could you share with us the precise military 
objective of this mission will the american troops remain there 
only until saddam hussein removes his troops from the saudi border 
bush i cant i cant answer that because we have we have a 
major objective with those troops which is the defense of the 
soviet union so i think its beyond 
cross talk 
bush laughing a defense of saudi arabia so i think its 
beyond the i think its beyond just the question of the tanks 
along the border 
q sir are you preparing for a prolonged ground 
bush a lot of air power for example 
q are you preparing for a prolonged ground war in the persian 
gulf 
bush im not preparing for a long ground war in the persian 
gulf theres not a war going on there right now 
q but im just saying could you just tell the american people 
what your specific military objective is 
bush my military objective is to see saudi arabia defended 
thats the military objective our overall objective is to see 
see saddam hussein get out and go back and to have the rightful 
regime of kuwait back in place yes

the thank you that ended president bushs 
news conference wednesday came not from the press corps but the 
president thanking reporters for correcting several mistakes 
bush verbally confused iraq and saudi arabia and also said the 
main us objective in sending troops to the persian gulf area was 
the defense of the soviet union 
asked at one point what persuaded him to send us troops to 
saudi arabia bush replied if there was one it would perhaps be 
the saudis moving south when they said they were withdrawing as 
reporters murmured the iraqis bush said i mean the iraqis 
moving south thank you very much its been a long night 
later bush said we have a major objective with those troops 
which is the defense of the soviet union 
as reporters chorused saudi arabia bush laughed and 
corrected himself 
bush also spoke of the preinvasion substantial boycott of 
iraqi troops on the kuwait border he caught the mistake himself 
changing the word to buildup 
he ended the brief news conference with these words 
thank you all very much and let me just say this on a personal 
basis i screwed up a couple of times here and im very grateful 
for your assistance in straightening it out 
god id hate to have had some of those answers stand bush

the broadway production of miss saigon was 
canceled wednesday after actors equity refused to allow a white 
british actor to play the role of a eurasian in the musical 
the debate is no longer about the casting of miss saigon but 
the art of acting itself producer cameron mackintosh said in a 
statement issued on behalf of the creative team for the hit london 
musical 
the show scheduled to open in march at the broadway theater 
had a more than 25 million advance sale the largest in broadway 
history the money according to mackintosh will be refunded the 
producer said an estimated 600000 already spent on 
preproduction work for the show has been lost 
the union tuesday denied englishman jonathan pryce permission to 
repeat his awardwinning performance as a brothel owner when the 
london hit comes to new york in march 
the casting of a caucasian actor made up to appear asian is an 
affront to the asian community said alan eisenberg the unions 
executive secretary 
the casting choice is especially disturbing when the casting 
of an asian actor in this role would be an important and 
significant opportunity to break the usual pattern of casting 
asians in minor roles 
the union has jurisdiction over all performers appearing on 
broadway and must give its approval to actors from foreign 
countries who appear there except for british stars but the 
definition of star is hazy 
we did not deal with the issue of whether this man is a star 
or not eisenberg said 
mackintosh said he would not take the matter to arbitration a 
process equity suggested tuesday might be the next step 
the inaccurate and inflammatory statements which equity made 
concerning miss saigon have served only to craete a poisonous 
atmosphere in which creativity and artistic freedom cannot function 
or survive mackintosh said arbitration cannot clear this 
atmosphere 
mackintosh and other producers have argued that the ban is an 
infringement on their right to choose the performers they want 
when my production team cast the noted black actor robert 
guillaume to replace michael crawford as the phantom in the los 
angeles company of phantom of the opera we did so purely on the 
grounds of talent and suitability mackintosh said last week 
ironically in the current broadway production of phantom we 
have an amerasian actor of tremendous ability playing the lead role 
of the vicomte de chagny why is it quite proper for him to play a 
european artistocrat and not for jonathan pryce to play a 
eurasian 
robert stigwood who produced the musical evita said in a 
letter to equity earlier this week that he is casting the film 
version of the show 
does the view of actors equity concerning ethnic casting 
preclude my consideration of an americanitalian female star to 
play the title role he asked will i incur the wrath and 
condemnation of actors equity for casting a nonhispanic in the 
role of che 
eisenberg said the unions decision was made in full awareness 
that many jobs may be lost to actors of asian background if 
miss saigon is canceled 
according to variety the musical would employ 182 people 
including 50 actors and stage managers 26 musicians and 34 
stagehands 
nontraditional casting has been more common offbroadway 
particularly at the new york shakespeare festival where black 
actor morgan freeman recently played petruchio opposite tracey 
ullman who is white in a central park production of the taming 
of the shrew 
the festival has used black hispanic and asian actors in almost 
all its recent shakespeare productions it even cast actress diane 
venora in the title role in hamlet several years ago 
you do nontraditional casting whenever possible but it 
depends said alan coleridge a casting director you look at 
the text does the text support it 
the controversy over miss saigon began with a complaint 
filed by playwright david henry hwang author of m butterfly 
and actor bd wong who starred in the play 
there is no doubt in my mind of the irreparable damage to my 
rights as an actor that would be wrought if asian actors are 
kept from bringing their unique dignity to the specifically asian 
roles in miss saigon wong said in a letter to equity president 
colleen dewhurst 
in london pryce won the olivier award as best actor in a 
musical for his performance in miss saigon he won praise on 
broadway in 1976 for his performance in comedians which earned 
him a bestactor tony award 
about 300 to 400 of equitys 40000 members are asian eisenberg 
said 
we are talking here about color and this union responding to 
the wishes of its membership dewhurst said tuesday

q mr president can you tell us what us and saudi forces 
will be up against you mentioned surfacetosurface missiles 
youve spoken previously of the chemical warfare capability of the 
saudis sic may mean iraqis what are they up against and the 
second question is the second part of the question is did we 
misread saddam hussein a couple of months ago your people were up 
on the the administration was up on the hill deflecting a move to 
put sanctions on on on 
bush let me let me ask you im not going to take the 
question on the exact military problem there because were going to 
have a thorough briefing at the pentagon i think theyre much 
better equipped to handle that kind of detail on saddam hussein 
look we have tried very hard to see if there wasnt a way to have 
somewhat improved relations theres no question about that but 
and i have no regret about having tried to have discussions that 
might have led to a better relationship 
but that had to stop the minute you have this this kind of 
aggression but i dont think having having tried tentatively to 
have a little better relationship with a person over the last 
couple of years weve still been very very wary all along of his 
of his intentions 
q but did our intelligence let us down or or did you know 
that what has happened when did you get an indication of 
inaudible as far as moving into kuwait and that sort of thing 
bush no i dont i dont feel let down by the intelligence at 
all when you plan a blitzkrieglike attack thats launched at 200 
in the morning its pretty hard to stop particularly when you 
have just been given the word of the people involved that there 
wouldnt be any such attack and i think the intelligence community 
deserves certain credit for for for picking up what was a 
substantial boycott correcting himself a substantial buildup 
and then reporting it to us so and this information was relayed 
properly to interested parties but the move was so swift that it 
was pretty hard for them to stop it i really cant blame our 
intelligence in any way fault them in this particular in this 
particular goround yeah ellen 
q mr president you said this morning that our troops will 
also defend our other friends in the gulf do we view the american 
troops there as peacekeepers throughout the gulf 
bush we view them there to defend saudi arabia and hopefully 
their presence there will deter adventurism against any of the 
other gulf countries yes 
q what other countries sir are we prepared to defend in the 
gulf region 
bush well im not going to give you a list but but were 
certainly interested in the freedom and the independence of all 
those countries in the gcc just for openers yeah 
q mr president do you see any domestic impact on the budget 
talks or deficit from this situation in the middle east impact on 
the gasoline tax possibility or in any other way 
bush well an operation of this nature has considerable expense 
associated with it but ive asked for some estimates now as to 
what that what that price may be but whatever it is were going 
to have to pay it but i dont have the exact figures yet john 
q mr president the national security analysts say that this 
crisis demonstrates once again the vulnerability constant 
vulnerability of the oil fields in the middle east doesnt this 
suggest that this force that youve sent over there may be there 
for some time or at least fragments of it will be there to make 
sure that there is a steady flow 
bush well you might interpret it that way im not prepared to 
say that i think thats what the outcome will be because i think 
if there is this pullback that the world is calling for and if 
the sanctions are effective i think you would reduce the risk of 
future adventurism

israelis hurled stones at arabowned cars 
wednesday as an unprecedented wave of antiarab rioting in 
jerusalem entered its third day 
the riots erupted monday after the discovery of the bodies of 
two jewish teenagers who had been stabbed to death apparently by 
palestinian militants thousands of israelis took to the streets 
injuring dozens of arabs in stoning attacks 
mayor teddy kollek a champion of coexistence in this mixed 
arabjewish city said the riots were the most effective attempt 
to redivide the city 
it will remain a unified city but the question is what kind 
of city will it be a pleasant city like in the last 20 years or a 
hard city like in the last 2 years kollek said referring to 
the 32monthold palestinian uprising 
for israel unity of jerusalem its declared eternal capital 
has been a matter of prestige since it captured arab east jerusalem 
from jordan in the 1967 middle east war and annexed it to west 
jerusalem 
palestinians demand east jerusalem home to 140000 arabs be 
the capital of their wouldbe state israel refuses to negotiate on 
the unity of the city 
invisible barriers strengthened by the palestinian uprising 
now crisscross the city dividing arab and jewish neighborhoods 
most of jerusalems 354000 jews are afraid to visit the citys 
eastern sector fearing stonings stabbings or firebomb attacks 
of the 47 israeli victims of the uprising eight have been 
killed in jerusalem at least nine palestinians have been killed by 
israeli security forces 
until recently antiarab rioting was rare but now fear has 
gripped the arabs 
i have a car with blue plates which means im an arab and 
frankly speaking i dont feel safe to drive to the western part of 
the city said ziad abu ziad a proplo newspaper editor 
arabs from the occupied territories have blue license plates 
while israeli citizens arabs and jews have yellow license plates 
israeli officials such as district police commander rahamim 
comfort acknowledged that such a situation never existed in the 
past 
kollek described tuesday as the hardest day jerusalem ever 
had that was after riots broke out following the funeral for the 
slain teenagers 
thousands of israelis many chanting death to the arabs 
thronged the funeral dozens of arabs were injured in the ensuing 
rioting one of the wounded was in critical condition wednesday 
the violence continued wednesday as jewish mobs stoned 
arabowned cars and taxis several windshields were smashed but 
there were no reports of injuries 
israel radio said that by late wednesday police had arrested 
some 35 jews for stoning arabs and their property over the past two 
days 
many west bank palestinians stayed away from jerusalem for fear 
of attack 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs adviser avi pazner insisted 
that the city is not divided 
this is nonsense i heard the same two months ago when there 
were disturbances in arab villages of silwan and atur pazner 
said the key is that the arabs have to understand that this is 
one city that they have to live in peace with us any action like 
such a horrible murder will make tensions rise

q in your call to the producing countries to pick up the slack 
do you expect that to begin immediately 
bush well i think it will start very very soon i dont know 
about today by any 
q mr president with the economy tipping close to the edge of 
a recession do you think we still can afford to raise taxes or cut 
spending or wont that increase the risk of a inaudible 
recession 
bush i still think its absolutely essential to get a budget 
agreement and thats going to require a lot of compromise and its 
going to require a lot of principle but you know what i want to 
do is separate out my feelings about the budget now that i feel 
uninhibited by an agreement not to say anything because i want to 
tell you exactly how strongly i feel about it but i dont want to 
do it here today i dont want to mix it into this briefing that is 
largely you know dominated by the world concern about the middle 
east but i feel like a liberated human being now i dont feel 
bound by 
q why not 
bush by may i finish what im saying here laughs i 
dont feel bound by an agreement that ive told the congressional 
leaders is no longer in effect and weve been getting one side of 
that mainly from the democrats in the congress and now youre 
fixing to get the other but not this minute you have to stay 
tuned 
q mr president to follow up do you think the spike in oil 
prices which has occurred significantly at home as a result of the 
persian gulf problem could edge the economy into a recession 
bush i have not been advised of that i hope that is not the 
case and what i hope to do is see a reduction in oil prices once a 
once it becomes clear that there will not be shortage theres an 
overhang now of oil in the marketplace thank god we have a 
strategic petroleum reserve that we can draw from other countries 
have the same a couple of other countries have sprs themselves 
and i hope that this rapid spike on oil prices will not be 
permanent and i think if we if the world begins to see 
assurances that there will not be a dramatic cutoff or cutdown 
on oil that then things will return much more to normal in the 
market yeah 
q mr president 
q mr president assuming that 
bush one more after this 
q assuming that we achieve the goal of iraqi forces out of 
kuwait saddam hussein is still going to be sitting there on top of 
a millionman army inaudible what happens in the long run 
after that and can you contain that with short of removing 
saddam hussein from power 
bush i would think that if this international lesson is taught 
well that saddam hussein would behave differently in the future 
and thats what has been so very important about this concerted 
united nations effort unprecedented you might say or certainly not 
enacted since 19 what was it 23 years ago 19 23 years ago 
so i i i dont think we can see that clearly down the road 
but a line has been drawn in the sand the united states has taken 
a firm position and i might say were getting strong support from 
around the world for what weve done ive been very very pleased 
about that large countries and small countries the world reaction 
has been excellent and i would hope that all of this would result 
in saddam hussein or some calmer heads in iraq understanding that 
this kind of international behavior is simply unacceptable and we 
see where we go 
q mr president 
bush yes sarah 
q sir would you please 
bush this is the last question 
q i understand that we provide most of the food for iraq and 
have done so on the long term and short term and subsidy payments 
credit inaudible for some time that means that weve been 
letting them have a lot of food and a lot of other products from 
our farmers at probably low rates arranged by the department of 
agriculture now do you would you please discuss the effect of 
your embargo and how much do you think that the iraqis already owe 
us for food 
bush well i dont know what they owe us for food but i know 
that this embargo to be successful has got to encompass 
everything and if there are you know if theres a humanitarian 
concern pockets of starving children or something of this nature 
why i would take a look but other than that this embargo is 
going to be all encompassing and it will include food and i dont 
know what iraq owes us now for food generally speaking in normal 
times we have felt that food might be separated out from you 
know grain wheat might be separated out from other economic 
sanctions but this one is all encompassing and the language is 
pretty clear in the united nations resolution 
thank you all very much and let me just say this on a personal 
basis ive screwed up a couple of times here and im very grateful 
for your assistance in straightening it out god id hate to have 
had some of those answers stand 
thank you

american ground and air forces fortified saudi 
arabias defenses against iraq today with two powerful aircraft 
carriers positioned to block vital sea routes and protect troops 
rushing into the desert kingdom 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staffs said 
the first us military aircraft dispatched from the united states 
have arrived in saudi arabia and taken up position 
powell said five awacs reconnaissance planes were arriving 
today in addition defense secretary dick cheney said the united 
states had granted a saudi request to waive the cap on the number 
of f15 jetfighters the kingdom is allowed 
at a pentagon briefing powell and cheney refused to provide 
many specific details of the us troop movements or describe the 
size of the sudden deployment 
you can be sure that for the mission we have been given we 
will put in adequate forces powell said of the battletested 
iraqis powell said they are not invincible they are not 
10feet tall 
powell using a map of the gulf area demonstrated where the 
aircraft carrier uss independence and its support ships have taken 
up positions just outside the persian gulf and the carrier uss 
eisenhower in the red sea not far from the end point of an iraqi 
oil pipeline and within range for its aircraft and other weapons to 
engage iraqi forces 
on the ground already in saudi arabia are the first arrivals 
among the warplanes and ground forces ordered into the oilrich 
country on tuesday the pentagon officials said 
powell said the troops brought with them protective clothing and 
medical supplies to be used in the event iraq uses its sizeable 
stores of chemical weapons against the american forces 
powell and cheney briefed reporters four hours after president 
bush delivered a nationally televised address in which he confirmed 
his decision to send us forces into the tense persian gulf region 
cheney described the deployment as a major commitment of us 
forces but said he could not provide specific details for 
strategic reasons 
our purpose in sending forces at this time into the gulf 
region and to saudi arabia in particular is to deter any further 
iraqi aggression cheney said he said he expected other nations 
to join the us forces in the area but with the exception of 
great britain he refused to name other nations expected to 
participate in the multinational effort 
pentagon sources said earlier that the us arsenal will include 
heavy tanks for possible ground battles and sophisticated cruise 
missiles programmed to destroy specific iraqi targets 
thirtytwo tomahawk cruise missiles are aboard the battleship 
wisconsin which was sent from the united states to the gulf area 
tuesday night according to sources who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
the sources also said today that a second navy cruiser had been 
added to the gulf bringing the number of us ships in the 
strategic waterway to nine 
at the pentagon briefing powell said the carrier eisenhower 
accompanied by five other warships today completed its transit of 
the suez canal enroute to the gulf 
president bush in his speech this morning said the us forces 
were on a wholly defensive mission and added they will not 
initiate hostilities but they will defend themselves 
should it come to that one of the sources today said the 
tomahawks would be a crucial part of the us arsenal 
they are sophisticated terrainfollowing cruise missiles 
programmed with special software packages that allow them to hone 
in on specific targets such as iraqi oil refineries the source 
said you sit off beyond the range of the iraqis and fire in 
the sources also said several of the marines prepositioned 
supply ships based at the supersecret us facility on the island 
of diego garcia have set sail for the region the sources said 
this first movement is of light infantry and airborne troops 
but these ships have the heavy tanks m1a1 abrams and m60s that 
are needed for heavyduty ground fighting one source said 
it will take the wisconsin which is escorting the carrier 
saratoga at least a week to reach the eastern mediterranean the 
sources said 
us forces were ordered into saudi arabia and the gulf region 
tuesday as the bush administration with fresh intelligence on 
iraqi troop activities in kuwait declared the saudi kingdom under 
imminent threat of attack 
under the saudi desert lie the largest oil reserves in the world 
cheney as bush had earlier declined to speculate on the 
possible length of the historic us presence in the volatile 
region 
we dont know how long it will last cheney said 
among the dangers facing us troops in a conflict with iraq is 
saddams arsenal of chemical arms and his track record of using 
them as a weapon of mass destruction 
powell said it was unclear whether iraq was preparing its 
chemical weapons for use but we attribute them with that 
capability 
the army units facing duty in saudi arabia are part of the 
nations rapid deployment 
the reaction from iraq was defiant state television declared 
that history has proved that kuwait is a part of iraq 
in his remarks the president conceded that the saudi defense 
mission may take time and be costly and said he would consider 
tapping the nations strategic petroleum reserves to assure a ready 
supply of oil he called on the oil companies not to engage in 
unnecessary price hikes to take advantage of the international 
uncertainty and urged that other oilproducing nations boost 
production 
bush sidestepped a question about what other countries would be 
joining a multinational force in saudi arabia id prefer to 
leave that to the saudis to announce he said he noted that 
british prime minister margaret thatcher had said she would commit 
forces 
egypt and morocco had said they were not participating in the 
saudi defense buildup contrary to reports from some us sources 
bush said encouraging things about both nations but did not claim 
their involvement 
bush said it wouldnt be at all surprising if there were an 
arab component in the force that eventually took shape in saudi 
arabia 
bush also said he was concerned with the possibility that iraq 
might use chemical weapons since it has employed them in the past 
it would be intolerable and it would be dealt with very very 
severely 
powell said the american forces were equipped with masks 
clothing and medicine to thwart the chemical weapons 
he expressed confidence about the mission saying of the 
battletested iraqis they are not invincible they are not 10

religious discussions and chanting of verses from the koran 
we are calm because we trust in god said atiya alanzi a 
shopkeeper in dammam we will be afflicted only if god wills it 
this way otherwise god will protect us and grant victory to our 
leaders but i must admit that households families are a bit

whose ruler is a kind and honest man iraqi president saddam

president bush said wednesday hes no longer 
bound by his vow of silence with the democrats on the deficit 
talks making him feel like a liberated human being 
bush at a news conference on his decision to send us troops 
and warplanes to saudi arabia did not unburden himself of his 
feelings on the long sputtering talks but he left no doubt that he 
soon will 
i still think its absolutely essential to get a budget 
agreement and thats going to require a lot of compromise and its 
going to require a lot of principle bush said 
he said he would like to tell you exactly how strongly i feel 
about it but i dont want to do it here today i dont want to mix 
it into this briefing dominated by the world concern about the 
middle east 
but i feel like a liberated human being now i dont feel 
bound by an agreement that ive told the congressional leaders is 
no longer in effect bush said 
weve been getting one side of that mainly from the democrats 
in the congress bush said and now youre fixing to get the 
other but not this minute you have to stay tuned 
the president indicated earlier that he would feel free to speak 
out against the democrats because they failed to come forward with 
a plan of their own 
the budget talks begun in may came to a temporary halt last 
week when lawmakers left town on a onemonth summer vacation bush 
and congressional leaders congress plan to take another crack after 
labor day at whittling down the nearly 170 billion deficit looming 
for 1991 
bush said that sending us troops to saudi arabia entails 
considerable expense 
ive asked for some estimates now as to what that price may 
be but whatever it is were going to have to pay it he said 
the white house said tuesday that it has given the initial order 
to federal agencies to prepare for deep automatic spending cuts in 
october if the budget talks fail 
without an agreement the grammrudman law will require 
acrosstheboard cuts in many programs of roughly 100 billion 
thats not counting the cost of the savingsandloan bailout which 
could push the actual 1991 deficit from 169 billion to 231 
billion or more 
grammrudman requires a 1991 deficit no larger than 64 billion 
bush in late june backed off his nonewtaxes campaign 
promise and acknowledged that solving the deficit will require tax 
revenue increases both sides agreed at the outset to try to 
conduct the bargaining with no private preconditions 
a republican proposal to raise taxes on alcohol and limit state 
and local income tax deductions subsequently came to light while 
the democrats refused to put any package of their own on the table 
the negotiators were aiming at reducing the deficit by 50 
billion in 1991 and 500 billion over five years 
with the sluggish economy already veering dangerously close to a 
recession even before the recent spike in oil prices some 
economists predict the budget negotiators will be forced to adopt a 
more modest goal for reducing next years red ink

a third of americans are shelter poor 
spending so much of their incomes on housing that they cant afford 
other necessities a study released wednesday said 
the report by the economic policy institute a liberal economic 
research organization said 27 million households are unable to 
meet their nonshelter needs at even a minimum level of adequacy 
because of high housing costs 
those households contain 78 million people or 32 percent of the 
population the organization said 
the study said 42 percent of all who rent their homes were 
shelter poor in 1987 the last year of the study twentytwo 
percent of homeowners were in that category it said 
the number of shelter poor households increased from 187 
million in 1970 to 265 million in 1987 a 42 percent increase the 
study concluded 
the studys author michael e stone professor of community 
planning at the university of massachusetts in boston used an 
index that assumes a family pays its rent or mortgage first then 
uses what income is left to pay for basic needs such as food 
clothing transportation and medical care 
he concludes that people are shelter poor if their household 
has too little left after paying the housing costs to afford the 
minimum basic necessities as defined by the federal governments 
bureau of labor statistics low budget standards 
stones index differs from conventional rules of thumb that 
families have housing affordability difficulty if they pay more 
than 25 or 30 percent of their income for housing he instead used 
a sliding scale of affordability varying with income and size of 
household 
some households can afford less than the traditional 25 
percent of income stone said indeed some can afford nothing 
for housing while others can pay more than 25 percent and even 30 
percent without hardship 
his report contends that growth in one and twoperson households 
since 1970 has concealed an increase in housing affordability 
problems experienced by families with children 
the shelter poverty rate for one and twoperson households 
declined from 32 percent to 26 percent during the period while the 
rate for households with three or more people rose from 29 percent 
to 34 percent 
the problem is worst among the poorest onethird of households 
but also affects some middleincome households particularly 
renters the study said 
the study said the average shelter poor household faced a 
gap of 290 a month between what they were paying and could afford 
for housing 
shelter poverty is in part a problem of worsening income 
inequality and declining real incomes among those at the bottom of 
the distribution the study said but it is also a problem of 
escalating housing costs

the recent outbreak of a potentially fatal disease 
linked to ltryptophan probably came from an impurity introduced by 
a change in how the dietary supplement was made according to a 
report 
disease experts in several states have traced the mysterious 
illness to supplements made by one japanese chemical company that 
produces ltryptophan in bulk 
now doctors have tracked down the specific batches responsible 
for the outbreak and conclude that changes in the way they were 
made including less filtering of possible toxic contaminants were 
the most likely cause 
we believe that some of the toxic agent has been getting 
into ltryptophan for years said dr michael t osterholm 
but there was a series of circumstances that may have 
increased the agent in the product in late 1988 and at the same 
time resulted in lowering the amount removed in the finished 
product 
osterholm the minnesota state epidemiologist said researchers 
are now trying to pinpoint the poisonous substance that apparently 
contaminated the supplements 
all ltryptophan was ordered off the market in the united states 
in march after it was linked with an outbreak of 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome that has struck more than 1500 
people killing 27 the painful blood disorder can cause high 
fever rash weakness and shortness of breath among other symptoms 
ltryptophan an amino acid has been used to treat insomnia 
depression and other disorders it is made in bulk by six 
companies but the outbreak was linked to the showa denko kk firm 
of japan 
osterholm was senior author of the latest report along with 
other researchers from the us centers for disease control the 
mayo clinic and the minnesota department of health it was 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
while most of the cases of the blood disease associated with 
ltryptophan were spotted during 1988 and 1989 osterholm said 
others occurred in the early 1980s 
ltryptophan is made in fermentation vats by the bacteria 
bacillus amyloliquefaciens 
the researchers found that the problems began after showa denko 
started using a new strain of the microbe and cut in half the 
amount of carbon used to filter out impurities 
what we were able to demonstrate without a doubt was that 
there were changes that occurred that let more of it the toxic 
substance be in there said osterholm 
alan wachter a spokesman for showa denko said the company 
has acknowledged that there was a statistical profile that pointed 
to their product as the cause of the outbreak however he said 
it is still uncertain whether the fault lies in changes in its 
manufacturing process

kidnappers freed a swiss red cross worker 
in lebanon today and handed him over to syrian authorities a 
syrian official said 
reporters were summoned to the foreign ministry in damascus for 
the imminent handover of the hostage to swiss officials 
there was no immediate word on the identity of the hostage one 
of two red cross workers kidnapped 10 months ago in sidon in 
southern lebanon 
it was the first breakthrough in the hostage situation since 
april when two american hostages were freed 
a group calling itself the palestinian revolutionary squads had 
said in a statement released late tuesday that it would free the 
two hostages within 24 hours it was not known why only one hostage 
was expected in damascus 
the statement delivered to the independent newspaper annahar 
and a western news agency came with a photograph of captive 
emanuel christen he appeared with short hair a clipped beard and 
a mustache and looked straight into the camera 
christen 33 was kidnapped oct 6 along with elio erriquez 24 
outside the artificial limbs center in south lebanons port city of 
sidon where the two worked as orthopedic technicians sidon is 25 
miles south of beirut 
it was the first claim of responsibility for the kidnapping of 
the two swiss men by a group since their abduction 
police in sidon had blamed their abduction on the 
libyanfinanced fatahrevolutionary council faction led by 
palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal but the group had 
denied the charge 
the fatahrevolutionary council faction has reportedly been 
undergoing bloody internal purges over the past year 
the statement said the decision to free the red cross captives 
came in response to the wishes of syrian president hafez assad 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi and algerian president chadli 
bendjedid 
christen and erriquez have been among 16 foreigners held hostage 
in lebanon since march 1985 the others are six americans four 
britons two west germans an irishman and an italian 
two american hostages were released within a week of one another 
in april 
the statement also said the group had guarantees that their 
demands would be met but did not specify what the demands were 
the longest held foreign hostage is terry anderson 42 chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped 
march 16 1985

mirrors being built for a 747 million series 
of weather satellites have been found to warp and become useless in 
the temperature extremes of space nasa officials said wednesday 
the problem marks the second time in recent months that a nasa 
project has been seriously affected by failed mirror technology 
engineers found in june that a mirror aboard the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope was ground to the wrong specifications and 
produces only a blurred visual image 
a spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration said the new flaw was discovered by itt aerospace a 
subcontractor for the project and that the planned weather 
satellites can not be completed and launched until a solution is 
found 
the visual images from these mirrors would be pretty close to 
useless said bryan dunbar a space agency spokesman 
the mirrors are being built for a satellite to be launched in 
february 1992 as the first of five in a series of robot weather 
observers 
dunbar said engineers for nasa itt and ford aerospace the 
prime contractor are scrambling to correct the problem in time for 
the 1992 launch and it is possible that there could be no delay if 
a solution is found quickly 
managers of the nasa program were not available for comment 
dunbar said 
officials said the problem occurs only when the 12by20oval 
mirrors are exposed to the intense light of the sun in space 
dunbar said tests in a vacuum chamber showed that intense 
sunlight such as experienced by satellites in orbit can warp the 
mirrors that distorts images that the mirrors reflect into 
instruments aboard the satellite 
nasa is supervising construction of the weather satellites for 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said frank 
lepore a noaa spokesman he said the space agency builds and 
launches the satellites and that the weather bureau takes over the 
operation once the craft are at geostationary orbit 22300 miles 
above the earth 
the weather craft scheduled for launch in 1992 is to supplement 
the single satellite that noaa now has for cloud cover observations 
over the united states 
lepore said that the current satellite called goes 7 was moved 
over the center of the us after goes 6 failed last year he said 
the weather bureau prefers to have satellites over both coasts so 
the craft can observe ocean storm fronts far from us shores 
the weather satellites take pictures of the cloud cover that are 
commonly published in newspapers and broadcast on television 
dunbar said that the mirrors for the new series of weather 
satellites are made of berylium metal coated with nickel the 
reflective surface is then coated with aluminium and silicone 
dioxide 
he said that after two mirrors were made itt discovered in a 
computer simulation that the mirrors would warp when exposed to 
direct sunlight in space itt then tested the computer model in a 
vacuum chamber and confirmed the problem dunbar said 
the new weather satellites are to have two of the 12by20inch 
mirrors one will be used to reflect cloud cover images in visible 
light to a camera the other will be reflect light to an infrared 
detector which can then determine temperatures in the lower 10 
miles of the atmosphere

here are excerpts from president hosni 
mubaraks nationally televised speech wednesday on iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
brothers our country and the arab nation are passing through 
very difficult and complicated circumstances you are used to me 
talking with you with complete honesty about any internal or 
external event which affects egypt or arab national security 
today i find myself obliged to warn of the extreme danger we 
have to consider with concern and extreme care the disastrous 
effects that it could have if it continues 
i am neither biased to this side or that i do not want it 
misunderstood that i am biased to the kuwaiti side against iraq it 
is a matter of principles egypt has its principles and positions 
and these positions cannot be sold for money 
the problem started with the border problem between iraq and 
kuwait this border dispute goes back long years kuwait should 
have moved and tried to resolve it 
i held long talks with our brother president saddam hussein of 
iraq i asked him outright if his troops were moving toward 
kuwait and his told me these were just routine movements and that 
the troops were 70 kilometers about 40 miles away from the 
border i asked him if he intended to attack and he told me no he 
told me that he had had enough and i said good then we can work 
on finding a compromise 
later they told me iraq had invaded kuwait and that paralyzed 
my thoughts i am a military man and know how these things develop 
i woke up still finding it hard to believe it was happening to 
two arab sisters i was dazed 
the day of the invasion king hussein said he would pass by me 
we sat and talked and i told him the situation was very serious we 
decided that no one wants an arab summit because we would only sit 
and curse each other i said to him king hussein i am afraid of 
the consequences of this it will be destructive and will put the 
arab nation on the spot and our position will be very bad i told 
him to go to talks with president saddam and stress two points 
1 the necessity for the immediate withdrawal from kuwait and 2 
the necessity for iraq to stop overthrowing other regimes by force 
because it is not its responsibility it is the right of the 
people 
i told him if the need arises egypt will join in forming an 
arab force to serve as a buffer zone between the two sides 
the crisis has become internationalized the arab league council 
condemned the invasion the organization of islamic conference 
also issued a similar condemnation as did the gulf cooperation 
council we were here snapping at each other while the security 
council met and condemned the iraqi invasion and demanded the 
withdrawal of the iraqi troops the security council was ahead of 
us as though the crisis was not arab as though the arabs are a 
dead body which does not want to move after that the security 
council met again and issued a more severe statement banning the 
exports of any iraqi or kuwaiti products and banning the sale of 
anything to iraq and kuwait it was like a seige and if this 
siege does not produce any results they move to article number 42 
which is a military siege and the use of military force and we 
were still sitting and watching 
the canadian prime minister and the american president bush and 
french president mitterrand and turkey and britain they all 
contacted me and said a siege is inevitable i tried to convince 
them to give us a chance i told president bush to give us a 
chance but he said he would issue the sanctions 
the issue is grave the situation is grave and the european 
countries are moving you saddam said you would not strike and 
you struck and now you are turning to saudi arabia and saying i 
will not strike they will not believe you do you think they 
will wait until disaster strikes them too we can see in the world 
news american planes and british vessels the world is moving 
freely in the region i told our brothers in iraq and i will tell 
you this is not a secret this is my estimation of the situation 
i tell you my point of view as a former military man i am 
afraid that iraq will be struck by a harsh strike from different 
sides dont think that the fleets are just going to sit there 
sleeping this is just my personal point of view i have not 
received any information that there is an attack coming it is 
clear to me that there is an attack coming and it could be 
destructive and frightening 
you saddam are not accepting the arab umbrella well you are 
getting the foreign umbrella american and french and british and 
other forces are being forced on you 
isnt it more honorable for us to solve our problems in the 
framework of an arab umbrella isnt it more honorable for us to 
listen to the sound of reason between each other i think the 
situation is very grave today fighter bombers went to an arab 
country an aircraft carrier passed through the suez canal 
someone might ask me to stop the aircraft carrier but i cannot 
stop it according to the international agreement i cannot 
stop anyone from passing through the canal except if i am at war 
with him 
you saddam cannot put me in a bind like this you cannot 
commit such a crime and then ask me for the impossible dont 
embarrass me just like you have interests i have interests i am 
trying as much as possible to protect arab honor 
everyone will ask for foreign troops after this there is talk 
that egyptian forces went to protect there saudi arabia we have 
no troops there we are not preparing troops and there is no talk 
about this but i tell you honestly if we are asked to 
participate with arab troops as a safeguard i do not think egypt 
would object to this arab joint troops i am not participating 
with foreign troops we hope to resolve this crisis with an arab 
solution in all truth the picture i see is black 
the picture is frightening and if we do not contain the 
situation and move very quickly we will no longer have a standing 
and we will be dead bodies and military powers will force things on 
us and will have their own way 
from this stand i call on president saddam and the iraqi 
leadership to respond to an arab umbrella and withdraw its forces 
from kuwait and restore the legitimacy of kuwait it is also 
possible to have joint arab forces to stand between the two sides 
until negotiations start to resolve the issue i am sure that the 
arab leadership will reach a solution to this problem at the same 
time time is running out very quickly and events are happening 
quicker than our movements 
i call for an emergency arab summit within 24 hours or even 
within a few hours it would be better than having a solution 
forced on us by foreign powers i hope arab presidents and kings 
will respond to this appeal and i am ready in this case to host the 
arab summit in egypt hoping that we reach a solution before 
something we do not like or accept happens 
national security is in danger and iraq is in danger they may 
say no but this is my point of view 
it will not be an arab summit to exchange curses or tear each 
others clothes but it will be to solve our problem in the arab 
framework which is more honorable to the arab nation

president bush driven by americas thirst for 
oil has undertaken the riskiest gamble of his administration by 
sending us forces to a faraway faceoff with one of the worlds 
most dangerous leaders 
other american presidents have painfully learned that the middle 
east can become a graveyard for us servicemen a prison for 
hostages and a sand trap for politicians 
bush acknowledged that the united states may have to pay a big 
price to stop iraqs saddam hussein from plundering saudi arabia 
and its vast oil reserves 
standing up for our principles will not come easy bush 
cautioned the nation in a speech wednesday from the oval office 
it may take time and possibly cost a great deal 
bush politically strong at home has received strong 
international support for his campaign to drive saddams troops 
from kuwait and keep them out of neighboring saudi arabia the 
largest single supplier of us oil 
in contrast to his normal caution bush decisively imposed us 
economic sanctions and an oil boycott against iraq and then rallied 
other world leaders to do the same 
so far so good 
in times of crisis americans are quick to support a president 
and rally around the flagpole in a nationalistic way said 
colorado college political scientist tom cronin 
however americans find fault with a president when casualties 
occur when hostages are taken and when maneuvers seem to backfire 
or are inept cronin added the risk is even greater in the 
middle east because we are under severe limitations of weather 
language distance and because of arab animosity toward the united 
states 
the danger of hostagetaking is real there are an estimated 
3000 americans in kuwait and 500 in iraq who are vulnerable to 
saddams whims what he does thats a bit unpredictable bush 
acknowledged 
even for a superpower like the united states saddam is a 
formidable foe 
his millionman force hardened by eight years of war with iran 
is the fourth largest army in the world it is armed with more than 
5600 tanks over 500 combat aircraft and a horrifying arsenal of 
chemical weapons that saddam has been willing to use even against 
his own countrymen 
ruthless and unpredictable saddam has proven his willingness to 
fight not only with helpless neighbors such as kuwait but with 
wellarmed adversaries such as iran 
its not a country that bluffs said judith kipper a middle 
east expert at the brookings institution theres no subtlety 
here hes saddam not somebody who puts troops on a border to 
wink and blink 
despite the hazards bushs hand was forced by americas 
addiction to foreign oil which accounts for 50 percent of the 
petroleum used in the united states 
iraqi control of saudi arabia would give saddam the unacceptable 
power to control oil supplies and prices bush said iraqs 
aggression could pose a major economic threat to the united states 
which already has been edging toward a recession 
if a recession comes now bush at least can blame saddam 
even while confronting the iraqi leader bush said us troops 
would be used solely to prevent an invasion of saudi arabia not to 
drive iraqi troops out of kuwait for now that second step is just 
too big bush judged he expressed hope that global economic 
sanctions would impel saddam to bring his troops home 
the crisis in the persian gulf puts a spotlight on bushs 
reluctance in recent months to try to restrain saddam despite many 
warning signs of menacing intentions 
the white house opposed congressional efforts to impose 
sanctions on iraq and argued it could win saddam over by diplomacy 
the fact is it didnt work conceded white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater we did the best we could 
there also are lingering questions about the effectiveness of 
bushs policy toward the middle east where the president has been 
frustrated time and again in efforts to win a broad peace agreement 
we have not had a regional policy said the brookings 
kipper we have tended to always look at this through the prism 
of the arabisraeli conflict 
suggesting a broader perspective she said we ought to look 
at it through an aerial view a satellite view thats been our 
failure the failure of the bush administration

iraq today annexed kuwait the emirate it overran six days ago 
and defied all the fleets and squadrons of aircraft of a 
usled force arab nations balked at challenging iraq militarily 
opting instead for more diplomacy 
us troops were deployed to protect iraqs neighbor saudi 
arabia in what washington calls a multinational effort 
but so far only britain has agreed to send troops though other 
nations have agreed to provide support the arab states of egypt 
and morocco declined to participate despite us reports that they 
would an arab summit meeting on the crisis was scheduled for 
thursday in cairo 
president bush in a nationally broadcast speech confirmed us 
forces were dispatched to the troubled region but he said were 
not at war 
meanwhile the economic and military noose slowly tightened 
around iraq turkey shut down the iraqis vital oil outlet to the 
mediterranean honoring a un trade embargo ordered to punish iraq 
for its takeover of kuwait one published report said the saudis 
had agreed to boost their oil output 
diplomats were working to arrange for the evacuation of 
foreigners stranded in kuwait and iraq including thousands of 
americans it was unclear whether the iraqis would allow all who 
wanted to leave 
iraq in a statement by its official iraqi news agency monitored 
in cyprus said its formal takeover of kuwait came at the request 
of the provisional government it installed in the emirate last week 
the revolutionary command council has decided to return the 
branch kuwait to the whole and to the iraq of its origins in a 
comprehensive and eternal merger the statement said iraq has 
long laid claim to kuwaiti territory and cited those claims as 
among the reasons for its invasion 
earlier an announcement on iraqi radio and television indicated 
the annexation was imminent calling kuwait part of iraq the 
later iraqi statement warned that outside military intervention 
would be useless 
all the evil and all the conspirators all the fleets and 
squadrons of aircraft all the centers of brute force inside or 
outside the arab homeland will not shake a single palm frond in 
basra kuwait or ahmadi the iraqi statement said mina 
alahmadi is kuwaits main oilloading terminal basra is a key 
port on the shattalarab in southern iraq 
saudi rulers have never before allowed us troops onto their 
soil and sources had said arab participation in the multinational 
effort was a saudi condition for doing so but morocco and egypt 
denied us reports their troops would participate 
the fact that the saudis are allowing in us forces and 
warplanes indicates they consider iraqs president saddam hussein 
to harbor further expansionist intentions 
egyptian president hosni mubarak called in a nationally 
televised speech for an emergency arab summit his spokesman 
mohammed abdelmoneim later said the meeting will be held in cairo 
on thursday evening 
abdelmoneim did not give the exact number of arab countries 
that had accepted mubaraks summit proposal but he said they 
included saudi arabia syria algeria djibouti the united arab 
emirates yemen libya and qatar 
bush provided no estimate of the number of us troops involved 
in the deployment but government sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said at least 5000 ground troops were involved along 
with 140 sophisticated fighters and bombers cruise missiles 
programmed to hit specific iraqi sites were aboard a battleship 
that set out on a weeks journey to the middle east 
todays iraqi announcement said the baghdadbacked provisional 
government of kuwait yearned to achieve complete unity between 
kuwait and iraq and for the hero saddam hussein to be our leader 
and protector 
iraq says it invaded to support a new government by 
revolutionary youth who had toppled kuwaits rulers but 
diplomats have called that a farce 
iraq had already announced that kuwaits currency was being 
linked on a onetoone basis to the iraqi dinar in another sign of 
imminent annexation 
on tuesday saddam said his people would rather die than be 
humiliated and threatened to pluck out the eyes of those who 
attack the arab nation 
no one should underestimate our determination to confront 
aggression bush said in a nationally broadcast address on the 
crisis if history teaches us anything it is that we must resist 
aggression or it will destroy us 
 
reports today by the washington post the new york times cnn 
and others quoted intelligence sources as saying iraqi forces 
appeared to be loading poison gas munitions aboard combat aircraft 
that was said to have sealed the decision to deploy us troops 
iraq did not hesitate to use chemical weapons during its 
eightyear war with iran and against its kurdish minority 
us troops and warplanes ordered on tuesday to guard oilrich 
saudi arabia against saddams millionman army would be part of a 
multinational force which sources said was a condition set by the 
saudis 
in addition to mubaraks denial that egypt was participating 
the morocaan news agency map said morocco would not participate in 
the multinational effort mubarak said egypt would consider acting 
in an arab force 
defense secretary dick cheney returned to washington today after 
a twoday swing to saudi arabia egypt and morocco after cheneys 
visit to saudi arabia bush administration officials said the 
saudis had agreed to increase oil production by 2 million barrels a 
day the new york times reported today such a move would help 
offset the reduction in world supplies 
meanwhile britain announced today that it will send unspecified 
naval and air force units to join the multinational force 
the multinational effort is designed to deter hussein if iraq 
compounds this with a fresh act of aggression it will be extremely 
expensive damaging and destructive to iraq foreign secretary 
douglas hurd said in london 
the multinational force would be far outnumbered by the 
estimated 100000 iraqi soldiers reported to have massed on 
kuwaits southern border but is seen as a symbol of us 
commitment to saudi defense 
as part of the bush administrations mobilization of forces to 
the tense region a us carrier group passed through the suez 
canal en route to the red sea today and a new us navy task force 
set sail from florida 
iraq overran kuwait after threatening its small neighbor for 
weeks over a border dispute baghdad also said kuwaits violation 
of opec oilproduction quotas amounted to economic war because 
overproduction kept oil prices down 
the conquest of kuwait drove oil prices up by about 30 percent 
and gave iraq control of 9 percent of world daily oil production 
if iraq were to conquer saudi arabia it would raise its share 
of world oil production to almost 20 percent 
but oil prices sank today in london in what traders said 
reflected confidence that there would be enough world oil 
production to make up for supplies lost in the wake of the iraqi 
invasion 
meanwhile many governments were drawing up regulations to 
enforce the antiiraq trade embargo ordered monday by the un 
security council at washingtons urging if fully enforced the 
boycott could cripple iraq which depends heavily on its oil 
exports for economic survival 
in saudi arabia the iraqi oil flow was reported slowing to a 
trickle through a pipeline on saudi territory because of the drop 
in demand due to the embargo but the saudis did not immediately 
announce a shutoff of the pipeline apparently not wanting to give 
saddam a pretext to invade

andrew youngs crusade to become the georgias 
first black governor foundered in a tidal wave of white votes but 
there was almost certainly more to it than that 
young was late to go on television late to articulate his 
message late to give georgia democrats a good enough reason to 
turn their backs on lt gov zell miller a populist theyd been 
electing and reelecting for 16 years 
miller buried young 68 percent to 32 percent in tuesdays 
democratic primary runoff and will meet republican state rep 
johnny isakson in november democratic gov joe frank harris was 
barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term 
american politics is complex young said wednesday its 
an insult to try to break it down as racial its not as simple as 
that 
youngs campaign manager hobby stripling a white smalltown 
mayor from southern georgia conceded wednesday that miller had 
effectively zoomed past the field before anyone figured out quite 
what was going on zell ran a very good campaign he said 
miller declared his candidacy two years out immediately 
dominating the race his television advertising was clever and 
sharply focused he said hed bring georgia a state lottery to 
benefit education he said hed put drug criminals in bootcamp 
prisons 
young the former atlanta mayor congressman and ambassador to 
the united nations didnt announce until january he didnt go on 
tv until june his first ads were bland and inoffensive mostly 
scenes of young in an integrated classroom telling georgians that 
yes he was proeducation 
he spent much of the time leading up to the july 17 primary in 
white rural southern georgia preaching his message of economic 
development in two terms as mayor he had brought jobs and 
prosperity to atlanta and he would do it for thomasville and 
moultrie and waynesboro 
he believes very strongly in the economics of the world 
stripling said it was very hard for him not to deal with that 
issue he likes that issue 
but the average voter just didnt give a damn 
some black leaders grumbled that young was taking his base the 
black vote for granted while pushing a traditional white 
probusiness campaign 
he hit snags cultivating what politicians call free media 
too 
reporters following young swapped stories about how many times 
they were unable to reach his press staff 
the day before the runoff youngs plane was filled with four 
staff members and two reporters while miller hauled at least three 
tv crews around the state 
young insisted more than once that his money was going to 
getoutthevote efforts rather than tv advertising but in black 
neighborhoods his historic campaign failed to turn out as many 
voters as jesse jackson did in 1988 
and finally young came as close wednesday as he will likely 
ever come to conceding that yes there was a little bit of racism 
involved 
i dont think therell ever be a colorless campaign he 
said i think we can be comfortable enough with our differences 
to not let that influence us too much 
young polled 80 or more of the black vote according to the 
votes from some key precincts but in some white counties he lost 
by a margin of nearly 20to1 
in other elections tuesday kansas gov mike hayden seeking a 
second term edged real estate executive nestor weigand jr in a 
sixway republican primary state treasurer joan finney won the 
democratic nomination upsetting former gov john carlin 
michigan republicans chose sen john engler over general motors 
engineer john lauve to challenge twoterm democrat james blanchard 
for governor in a race for the senate republican rep bill 
schuette defeated lawyer clark durant for the right to oppose 
democrat carl levin who is seeking a third term 
in missouri rep richard gephardt the house majority leader 
won the democratic nomination for an eighth term trouncing 
nicholas f clement a newspaper carrier who is a follower of 
extremist lyndon larouche

antiabortion activists said wednesday they 
would boycott american express and 43 other companies that donate 
funds to planned parenthood 
leaders of the christian action council said the move follows a 
letterwriting campaign in which companies were asked to withdraw 
support from planned parenthood because abortions are performed at 
its clinics 
the organization said the businesses should stay out of and 
keep out of the abortion business 
the christian action council said it was focusing its first 
boycott attempt on american express because that company is widely 
known not because it donated the most money 
american express spokeswoman toni maloney said the firm has not 
taken a stand on abortion 
we give to a lot of various projects that basically meet the 
themes of community service and education she said we gave 
two modest grants to planned parenthood projects in 1989 and we 
felt that both of those fell into those categories 
maloney said american express had not yet made a 1990 grant to 
planned parenthood but this year is only half over and last 
years donations were made late in the year she said 
david andrews vice president of planned parenthood of america 
said of the boycott threat american express is a very 
sophisticated corporation and theyre not going to be pushed around 
by the cac 
the christian action council had been pursuing a letterwriting 
campaign asking companies to withdraw support from planned 
parenthood because abortions are performed at its clinics 
the group said its actions led american telephone amp telegraph 
co to withdraw its support for planned parenthood beginning in 
1991 and that at least 10 other companies had followed atampts lead 
letters were sent pointing out to atampt that it was in a 
sense shooting itself in the foot by supporting an agency that 
kills its future customers said joe scheidler of the prolife 
action league 
andrews said he knew of no other businesses that had withdrawn 
financial support from planned parenthood 
i think that atampts withdrawal of support backfired not only 
on atampt but also on the cac we got thousands of new donors after 
that he said most corporations dont appreciate any interest 
group like the cac trying to dictate their corporate support 
maloney said american express was concerned about card holder 
complaints we have received calls both for and against our 
support of planned parenthood she said we know that we cannot 
please everyone all the time 
the cac says companies will be removed from its boycott list 
once they pledge to withdraw support or if support has not been 
given for more than five years

him up 
critics castigated last years star trek v blaming the 
films creative and box office failure on shatners direction so 
he was apprehensive about literary reviews of his first book 
in this business we all want to be loved and when someone 
says they dont like your work theyre saying in effect that 
they dont like you so you suffer for it he said in a recent 
interview 
reviews of shatners futuristic cop thriller tekwar 
published late last year with the paperback released a week ago 
were generally favorable 
he decided to throw caution to the wind and write the book 
because he was familiar with science fiction and police work 
shatner said he starred in the tj hooker cop series 
so i took a cop ive played and put him in the future then i 
took a subject that was in the news drugs and put it in the book 
then to keep costs down in case its made into a movie i set most

treasury secretary nicholas f brady said 
wednesday that oil price shocks need not topple the economy into a 
recession but he called on the federal reserve to stimulate growth 
with lower interest rates 
we are not contemplating recession brady said after a 
luncheon speech to the national press club 
certainly the events of last week where the price of oil has 
gone up are going to impose additional hardships on the country 
he said but i dont think we should come to judgment quickly 
however brady said he and president bush want the federal 
reserve to give economic growth a boost by lowering interest rates 
he said strong growth was particularly important now when the 
united states was responding to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
everybody wants lower interest rates at this point in 
time in the united states economic growth is very important he 
said 
he expressed confidence that federal reserve policy makers who 
meet next on aug 21 would lower rates in response to sluggish 
growth the economy as measured by the gross national product 
grew at an anemic 15 percent annual rate in the first half of 1990 
we look for lower interest rates the fact that the 
country is faced with slower growth will almost certainly produce 
lower interest rates brady said 
meanwhile the federal reserve reported that economic growth was 
slackening even before the price of crude oil soared from 20 a 
barrel before last weeks invasion of kuwait to 28 after 
in a july 27 survey of the federal reserves 12 district banks 
most noted that the pace was slow or had slackened recently 
the central bank said in a report known as the beige book 
richard w rahn chief economist of the us chamber of 
commerce said a recession is now unavoidable the economic impact 
of turmoil in the persian gulf is exacerbating the effects of the 
federal reserves tight money policy he said 
we anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual 
standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually 
contract by 14 percent in the fourth quarter he told a news 
conference our forecast shows the economy continuing to 
experience negative real growth in the first quarter of 1991 and 
practically no growth in the second quarter 
on other topics brady said 
he did not know if oil companies were taking advantage of 
consumers by raising gasoline prices so quickly after the invasion 
of kuwait but said if people are gouging those that are 
doing the gouging will hear from the president 
budget deficit negotiations with congress may produce a number 
different from the 50 billion reduction goal but that reducing 
the deficit was more important now that the united states was 
trying to exert its influence in the persian gulf 
the staggering cost of the savings and loan bailout frightens 
politicians into fingerpointing and blameavoiding the 
administration will rise above the political blame game he 
said while the line in the political world goes since i dont 
make mistakes someone else must be making them

a west german company involved in the 
construction of a libyan plant alleged to produce chemical weapons 
may have supplied plans for a second such facility prosecutors 
said wednesday 
juergen hippenstielimhausen the head of the imhausenchemie 
company was found guilty in june of shipping materials for the 
libyan plant he was sentenced to five years in prison 
mannheim prosecutor peter wechsung said 80 police officers 
raided various homes and offices wednesday seeking clues about the 
latest suspicions regarding imhausenchemie 
wechsung told the associated press that at the end of 1988 
when there were the first signs of the companys involvement in the 
libyan affair the firm had already been at work on the second 
facility 
according to prosecutors the imhausen company delivered the 
plans for the second plant in violation of west germanys export 
laws 
wechsung whose office has jurisdiction in the case added that 
imhausen is suspected of having used federal research funds to pay 
employees involved in the second project 
the prosecutor did not say how far the second project may have 
gotten or where it was to have been located he also did not say 
what led officials to suspect that plans for a second plant were 
under way 
suedwestfunk the state radio station in southern 
badenwuerttemberg said libyan leader moammar gadhafi planned to 
build it in sabhah deep in the desert the first plant was built 
in rabta about 50 miles from tripoli 
disclosures about german involvement in the rabta plant strained 
relations between washington and bonn for several months starting 
in december 1988 
the united states alleged the plant was intended to produce 
chemical weapons gadhafi denied it and said the plant was making 
pharmaceuticals 
on june 27 a mannheim superior court found hippenstielimhausen 
guilty of violating export laws and tax evasion in connection with 
the plant at rabta 
chief judge juergen henniger said that based on the testimony of 
expert witnesses the court concluded that the rabta plant was 
clearly intended for the production of chemical warfare agents 
henniger said the plant was capable of producing mustard gas and 
other poison gases and that hippenstielimhausen was aware of its 
intended purposes 
hippenstielimhausen 49 confessed in june to helping in 
construction but said he did not know the plant was intended to 
make poison gas 
the rabta plant was reportedly damaged by fire under mysterious 
circumstances earlier this year 
the united states initially said the blaze caused heavy damage 
to the plant but later news reports said us officials believed 
the fire was a hoax

the following was attributed to the provisional government of 
free kuwait 
honorable citizens of kuwait dear kinfolk in great iraq o sons 
of the glorious arab nation when the uprising in kuwait took place 
on august 2 the objective of the uprising was not just to remove a 
regime although it was a corrupt agent regime and replace it with 
a new national system 
the objective from the very beginning was a big and historic 
goal a dear panarab goal through which we would rectify 
comprehensively eternally and radically what colonialism had 
imposed on our country dear brothers the crystalclear historic 
fact is that kuwait is a part of iraq its people are iraqis and 
throughout their history they drank the waters of the tigris and 
euphrates rivers they grew up on the shores of the shattalarab 
the colonialism that partitioned the arab homeland to secure 
itself a foothold in the land of the arabs to exploit their 
resources and weaken them forever is what created an artificial 
entity called the state of kuwait 
the free provisional kuwaiti government has decided to appeal to 
our kinfolk in iraq the valiant men of alqadissiyah a 7th 
century arab victory over the persians the honorable generous 
chivalrous guards of the eastern gateway of the arab homeland led 
by the knight of the arabs and the leader of their march president 
field marshal saddam hussein to agree that their sons should 
return to their large family that kuwait should return to great 
iraq the mother homeland and to achieve a complete merger and 
unity between kuwait and iraq and for the hero saddam hussein to 
be our leader and protector of our march as the president of the 
republic of iraq as he is the chairman of the iraqi 
revolutionary command council 
we look to your decision and your heed to our call so the 
festival can be complete and so that jubilation may spread 
throughout iraq and the land of arabism we have relied on god let 
the faithful put their trust in god 
brothers in proud iraq this is our appeal and our decision

here are excerpts of an iraqi government announcement also 
broadcast by baghdad radio announcing that the merger has taken 
place 
in the name of god the merciful the compassionate o great 
iraqi people from the land to the sea o zealous arabs everywhere 
scarce are the days when the arabs are jubilant when they are 
joyous because of the meanings these days carry and when they look 
forward to the days to come 
one of the most egregious criminal acts of colonialism was its 
partition of the homeland which was a single homeland the day 
baghdad was the capital of all arabs and following the 
independence which arab countries won imperialism started 
intensifying its malicious actions 
thus the spiteful pencil and scissors of imperialism began to 
draw up maps 
in all cases while drawing up geographic and sovereign 
boundaries for all states western colonialism sought to make all 
states weak and to ensure that partition with the passage of time 
would prevent these states from closing ranks and demonstrating a 
unified stance 
thus colonialism achieved its objectives the strongest 
evidence to show its success is that it turned the arab homeland 
into 22 states by pursuing these methods colonialism divested 
the arabs of not only the components of material capabilities but 
also of the components of spiritual progress 
what has befallen other states in the arab lands befell iraq 
when colonialism divested it of a dear part of it namely kuwait 
and kept iraq away from the waters to prevent it from acquiring 
part of its tactical and strategic abilities and thus kept part of 
its people and part of its wealth away from the origin and the 
wellspring 
because the gates of the sky open up to the active and those of 
goodwill and to the determination of the believers who reject 
oppression tyranny and injustice the gates of the sky opened up 
to iraq before the day of the call on 2nd august the day of the 
invasion of kuwait and to its detached part kuwait 
woe be to us from gods torture if we are late in performing our 
duties toward him some of our duties to him and on his land are 
struggle and jihad holy war for the sake of a deep panarab 
awakening which rectifies affairs and retrieves for the arab 
individual his status and leading role in the message of god and 
life 
based on all this in view of what the situation has 
resulted in after the croesus entity previous kuwaiti government 
was shaken and after the earth under its feet and the feet of its 
collaborators collapsed with the objective of weakening the hopes 
of the traitors and evildoers inside and outside the arab homeland 
the revolutionary command council has decided to return the branch 
kuwait to the whole to the iraq of its origins in a comprehensive 
and eternal merger 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a separate report from the iraqi news agency the 
revolutionary command council was quoted as saying in a statement 
all the evil and all the conspirators all the fleets and 
squadrons of aircraft all the centers of brute force inside or 
outside the arab homeland will not shake a single palm frond in 
basra kuwait or ahmadi 
mina alahmadi is kuwaits main oilloading terminal basra is a

a california congressman says that health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan far from being a disgrace 
to his race as the congressman said last week is above reproach 
rep fortney pete stark dcalif delivered an apology in a 
letter to sullivan dated monday 
the existence of the letter was known tuesday but its contents 
were not revealed 
neither starks office nor that of sullivan would release copies 
of the letter but its text was made available wednesday by 
government sources who insisted on anonymity 
i apologize to you for the inaccurate inept indefensible and 
totally uncalled for remarks regarding you as a human and as a 
professional stark wrote on both counts you stand above 
reproach i hope you accept my apology 
stark chairman of the health subcommittee of the house ways and 
means committee created a furor last thursday when he said 
sullivan who is black was a disgrace to blacks because of his 
support for bush administration policies that stark contended have 
harmed minorities and the poor 
sullivan demanded an apology saying i dont work on pete 
starks plantation 
stark told the house a day later that i blew it by referring 
to sullivans race but he stood by his complaint about sullivans 
support for administration policies on abortion discrimination 
health insurance and other issues sullivan declined to construe 
those remarks as an apology 
sullivan referred to starks apology in a speech tuesday to the 
southern christian leadership conference in richmond va 
he said there is a rich deep and vital diversity within the 
black community this diversity is one of our strengths and we 
dont need other people to tell us what to think 
sullivan called starks remarks a public insult but he said 
that after receiving the apology i consider this unfortunate 
matter closed

an elderly recluse who couldnt make much 
money growing apples found he had a green thumb in the stock 
market he left more than 812000 in his will to help washington 
children 
stanislas dumas who never married and lived most of his life in 
a ramshackle farmhouse spent little and treated his stock earnings 
like monopoly money his stock broker said tuesday 
dumas left 812295 to two hospitals and a trade school said 
shearson lehman hutton inc broker bruce heiser who also served as 
dumas guardian 
for him it was monopoly money heiser said he never took 
a withdrawal from here 
he lived a very simple kind of life said heiser who said 
he became dumas best friend after they met in 1979 
at the time of his death dumas owned only a few clothes mostly 
overalls a rocking chair and bedroom set and a television sitting 
on top of two apple boxes heiser said 
he bought new cars and drank champagne heiser said that 
was the extent of his spending money 
dumas would sock the meager earnings from his apple orchard into 
stocks and rode the bull market of the 1980s to huge profits 
heiser said 
dumas died at age 85 in november 1988 the money from his will 
was distributed last september 
he left 325000 to yakima valley memorial hospitals neonatal 
unit 162295 to the shriners hospital for crippled children in 
spokane and 325000 to perry technical institute in yakima heiser 
said 
the different thing about this story is that the money didnt 
end up under his mattress said heiser 39 it ended up doing 
something magnanimous 
heiser said dumas was born and died on a 30acre apple farm 
outside of selah just north of yakima 
because dumas never changed the farming techniques he learned 
from his father the small farm was never very profitable heiser 
said but because the farmer spent so little he was able to save 
money to purchase stocks beginning in 1921 
most of his life dumas handled his stock transactions by 
telephone with brokers in seattle the seattle office passed the 
account to heiser in yakima in 1979 when the portfolio was worth 
79000 and mostly in south african gold stocks they later 
switched to oil stocks then hightech stocks heiser said 
dumas investments are still coming in heiser recently located 
1500 in a savings account that dumas had forgotten and checks 
come in from a revolving fund at a fruit packing warehouse that 
money also goes to the institutions in dumas will

a former bodyguard of winnie 
mandela was sentenced to death wednesday in the killing of a 
teenage political activist and officials said mrs mandelas 
alleged involvement in the case will be reviewed 
the supreme court sentenced jerry richardson 37 exbodyguard 
and coach of the mandela united soccer team in the killing of 
james stompie seipei moeketsi 14 there will be an automatic 
review by an appeals court 
the south african press association quoted witwatersrand 
attorneygeneral klaus van lieres as saying he now will consider 
the role in the case of mrs mandela wife of nelson mandela 
deputy president of the african national congress 
mrs mandela has not been charged her driver and other 
associates face trial next month on kidnapping and assault charges 
the judge held during richardsons trial that mrs mandela was 
at her home when moeketsi was assaulted there moeketsi was killed 
after being held at the house 
supreme court justice brian odonovan rejected defense arguments 
that a need by richardson to gain mrs mandelas favor and a 
desire to do whatever he thgought would please her was a 
mitigating factor in the killing 
it is difficult to see how kidnap and murder can be mitigated 
by the desire to please anybody odonovan said 
he also sentenced richardson to 18 years imprisonment for 
kidnapping assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and 
attempted murder 
moeketsi was found stabbed to death in january 1989 after 
richardson took him from mrs mandelas house in the black township 
of soweto richardson lived at the house with other young men who 
called themselves the mandela united soccer team and acted as mrs 
mandelas bodyguards 
last february a group of south africas most prominent black 
leaders said the soccer team engaged in a reign of terror in 
soweto they urged the community to shun mrs mandela 
she began to reappear at antiapartheid rallies however a few 
months before her husband was freed from prison 
according to trial testimony richardson and other associates of 
mrs mandela abducted the boy and three young men from a methodist 
churchrun home in soweto in late december 1988 the three men 
testified that mrs mandela richardson and other bodyguards beat 
and whipped them in a room at her house 
moeketsi was accused of being a police informer according to 
the testimony and the three men were accused of having homosexual 
relations with a methodist minister who ran the church home 
odonovan ruled that no evidence emerged to support the 
allegation against the minister only richardson was tried for the 
murder 
referring to trial testimony defense lawyer h joubert said 
mrs mandela had said moeketsi and the three abducted men were 
not fit to be alive and that she began the beatings 
president f w de klerk suspended hangings in february but 
courts may still impose the death sentence in murder cases when the 
judge finds no mitigating factors

two animal welfare groups have sued the us 
department of agriculture to try to force officials to regulate 
treatment of laboratory rats mice and birds 
in a lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court the humane 
society of the united states and the animal legal defense fund 
claim that the department misused its discretion in excluding rats 
mice and birds from the protection of the animal welfare act 
the two groups filed a petition with the department last year 
formally asking for regulations to cover rats mice and birds it 
was denied in june on the grounds that agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter has legal responsibility to decide which animals 
are covered aside from those specified in the text of the law 
dogs cats monkeys guinea pigs hamsters and rabbits 
kelly shipp spokeswoman for yeutter said she was aware of the 
groups concerns but could not comment on the lawsuit because she 
had not seen it 
martin l stephens the humane societys director of laboratory 
animals said rats mice and birds make up nearly 85 percent of all 
animals used in research testing and experimentation in the united 
states 
if these animals are needed in research surely they deserve 
minimum standards of care stephens said

the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
christen was handed to swiss charge daffaires fritz kuehni they

eyewitnesses said they were too far away to tell whether christen 
appeared to be in good health 
the statement from the palestinian revolutionary squads did not 
explain why only one of the swiss men was released it had said in 
a statement tuesday night they both would be freed within 24 hours

the soviet union kept conspicuously silent 
wednesday about the us military buildup in the middle east in 
what appeared to be a tacit endorsement of the moves against iraq 
moscows former ally 
moscow along with washington has strongly condemned the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait on wednesday the kremlin did not go so far as 
to offer immediate ships troops or moral support for president 
bushs announcement of a multinational force to deter any iraqi 
attack on saudi arabia 
but the soviet silence came in stark contrast to the past when 
moscow routinely denounced us military operations in libya 
panama grenada and lebanon 
the soviet foreign ministry held no briefings wednesday and no 
commentaries on the us moves appeared immediately in the 
staterun press factual accounts of bushs speech announcing the 
deployment of us troops in saudi arabia appeared on soviet 
television and in the official news agency tass 
the only hint of soviet reaction was anchorman igor fesunenkos 
remark on the television news program vremya about the most 
alarming news from the middle east introducing a report on 
iraqs announcement it had annexed kuwait fesunenko said i 
wouldnt take it upon myself to predict the consequences of this 
event 
during the crisis the soviets have acted in unprecedented 
cooperation with the united states despite their previous alliance

east german lawmakers pressed by a sinking 
economy voted on wednesday to merge with west germany in less than 
10 weeks 
the vote set the stage for a political showdown in west 
germanys parliament over the date of unification 
under the east german proposal approved wednesday the first 
united german elections in almost 60 years would be held oct 14 
formal unity would take place either immediately before or after 
the balloting 
the west german parliament would have to approve constitutional 
changes needed to allow elections to take place that quickly 
opposition social democrats in west germany have sworn to block 
those changes which require a twothirds majority in the lower 
house of parliament the bundestag 
the leftofcenter social democrats believe early unification 
but a later election date would hurt conservative west german 
chancellor helmut kohl because he would be blamed for east 
germanys deteriorating economy 
kohls christian democrats also the party of east german prime 
minister lothar de maiziere want unification and united german 
elections on oct 14 
the social democrats the secondlargest parties in both 
nations want unification alone on sept 15 and elections for a 
united government on dec 2 
kohl needs the approval of the social democrats to shorten the 
constitutional timetable for holding elections 
east german lawmakers on wednesday voted 187148 in favor of the 
oct 14 proposal for both joint elections and unification there 
were 11 abstentions 
oct 14 is also the date east germany will hold elections for 
the state governments it will create to match west germanys 
federal system 
wednesdays vote was a victory for de maiziere but he has 
nearly destroyed his governing coalition over the issue the social 
democrats in his coalition voted against the proposal 
unity must be completed quickly and well de maiziere said 
in urging approval of his partys proposal 
he said that splitting unity and elections would force east 
germany plagued by rising joblessness to endure too long a 
political campaign 
kohl is believed to want elections as fast as possible the 
prolonged dispute over unification has led to political 
bloodletting that could hurt him 
earlier wednesday east german lawmakers voted overwhelmingly 
for a proposal that the merger take place only after major 
international and domestic questions on unity are resolved 
that vote blocked an attempt by a small conservative party to 
seek an instant merger so west germany could assume immediate 
responsibility for east germanys faltering economy 
under the adopted resolution 
a political treaty on merging the german states must first be 
concluded expected before september 
the final round of unification talks must be concluded between 
the four world war ii allies the soviet union the united states 
britain and france the last session is set for sept 12 in moscow 
progress must be made on building the five states to which east 
germany will be reduced when it merges with west germany 
some lawmakers expressed embarrassment over the increasingly 
harsh debate that lawmaker christian schultze characterized as an 
unrestrained preelection campaign 
we politicians have not cut a good figure in the quarrel over 
this question said richard schroeder parliamentary leader of 
the east german social democrats 
the west german bundestag meets thursday 
all the parties say they are motivated by east germanys rising 
jobless rate and worsening economic situation since the july 1 
economic merger of the two nations

rebel leader prince johnson on 
wednesday freed foreign hostages and liberias west african 
neighbors prepared to send in peacekeeping troops to try to bring a 
halt to the bloodshed 
savage street battles raged in the liberian capital of monrovia 
where rebel armies loyal to johnson and his rival charles taylor 
were fighting each other and soldiers of the beleaguered president 
samuel k doe 
johnson seized the hostages monday and tuesday in a bid to 
provoke foreign intervention in liberias bloody 7monthold civil 
war earlier in the week the rebel leader presented 22 hostages 
from eight countries to reporters at a news conference 
the british foreign office said johnson released all the 
remaining hostages wednesday but said it had no total number 
however one official in london said four britons were among those 
freed 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the freed foreigners were back at a hotel he said they include one 
american whom he identified only as chris mendez he said the 
fighting prevented us officials from contacting mendez 
the other hostages included an argentinian a dutchman two west 
germans and 10 lebanese 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said wednesday 
that 2000 west african troops were being sent to monrovia by sea 
from freetown the capital of neighboring sierra leone 
they said most of the troops would come from nigeria the most 
powerful west african nation nigerian president ibrahim babangida 
said wednesday the troops would try to impose a truce and he hoped 
they would meet no resistance 
he did not say when the force was being dispatched but said it 
would be very soon 
in the past babangida has been a strong ally of doe taylor 
claimed earlier this week that the force was being sent to keep doe 
and his corrupt administration in power he had threatened to 
attack such an army 
military sources in freetown said troops of the force were on 
standby at the sierra leonean coastal village of sulina 10 miles 
from the liberian border 
reports from the nigerian capital lagos said troops also might 
be airlifted into monrovia 
the fivenation african force was to be led by lt gen arnold 
quainoo of ghana a cabinet minister who used to command the army 
according to ghanas government 
other nations sending soldiers are guinea sierra leone and togo 
babangida arriving in lagos from a twoday emergency summit of 
the west african economic community in gambia suggested the west 
african leaders hoped for some form of us intervention 
i believe the united states shares our desire to bring peace 
to liberia and halt the daily carnage there especially around 
monrovia urgently and we are hoping that this operation will get 
the support of america he said 
the 16nation west african community of which liberia is a 
member has asked the international community to help pay costs of 
the peacekeepers and proposed general and presidential elections 
estimated at 50 million 
leaders at the summit of the economic community of west african 
states said the troops were being deployed in the interest of the 
african people as a whole and for the maintenance of international 
peace and security 
the announcement said the troops would impose a ceasefire that 
would allow for the establishment of a broadbased interim 
government charged with organizing free and fair elections 
it said none of the warring parties would be permitted to 
participate in the interim government and no members of the 
interim government would be allowed to stand for election 
doe welcomed the west african initiative and taylors envoys 
told the gambia meeting they might accept such a force 
france appealed wednesday for its citizens in the liberian 
capital to make their presence known to the us or french 
embassies in case they needed to be evacuated a foreign ministry 
spokesman in paris said there are about 20 french nationals in 
liberia

nasa armed magellans rocket wednesday 
preparing the spacecraft to orbit venus for a 744 million mission 
to take the best radar pictures yet of the surface of the 
cloudcovered planet 
the agency has recently been embarrassed by a mirror defect that 
crippled the 15 billion hubble space telescope and hydrogen leaks 
that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet 
so engineers at jet propulsion laboratory are intent on making 
sure the unmanned magellan successfully fires its rocket friday to 
go into nearpolar orbit around venus 
if all goes well engineers will spend most of the month testing 
magellans radar and making adjustments sometime between aug 26 
and sept 1 magellan will start formal use of its radar to peer 
through thick venusian clouds and map the planet 
im able to sleep as long as i dont drink caffeine but i 
suspect im going to be very nervous until magellan is safely in 
orbit said magellan project manager tony spear its like your 
life can go either one direction or another so i dont plan after 
friday right now 
the 37ton magellan was released from the cargo bay of the 
shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 then fired an inertial upperstage 
booster rocket to launch it on a looping 948millionmile trip to 
the second planet from the sun 
engineers received a radio signal from magellan on wednesday 
indicating the spacecraft successfully completed an electronic 
circuit to arm a solidfuel star rocket spear said 
at 932 am pdt friday a computer program will automatically 
order the rocket to fire for 83 seconds the rocket firing 
forward will reduce magellans speed from 24600 mph to about 
18600 mph that will allow magellan to be captured by venus 
gravity into an orbit ranging from 171 miles to almost 5000 miles 
above the planet 
the spacecraft will be behind venus when the rocket ignites and 
wont emerge from venus shadow until about 954 am radio signals 
from magellan take almost 13 minutes to reach earth so it will be 
about 1007 am pdt when engineers receive a radio signal 
indicating magellan is in orbit 
if they receive the signal five minutes early that will mean 
the rocket didnt fire and magellan is speeding past venus in 
another major failure for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
but spear is optimistic the mission will work 
we trust our spacecraft he said its demonstrated it 
knows how to take instructions 
at midmorning wednesday magellan was 519095 miles from venus 
and 143 million miles from earth it was traveling at 10189 mph 
increasing speed as it was tugged by venusian gravity 
magellan will be able to detect venusian surface features larger 
than the length of about 2 football fields so its pictures will 
be about 10 times more detailed than the best pictures obtained by 
radars on earth or aboard some of the two dozen spacecraft that 
have visited the planet before 
venus is earths nearest neighbor other than the moon and the 
two planets are similar in size and density magellan may reveal 
whether the two planets also have similar geological processes 
including movements of gargantuan plates of shifting crustal rock 
it also may detect evidence of venusquakes determine if any 
of the planets tens of thousands of volcanoes are erupting and 
learn if venus had oceans before a runaway greenhouse effect 
raised its surface temperature to 900 degrees fahrenheit 
magellans prime mission is to map 70 percent to 90 percent of 
the planet during the first 243day cycle equal to one venus day 
nasa is expected to approve continued operation three 243day 
mapping cycles are needed to map the entire planet 
nasas comptrollers office says the total cost of the magellan 
mission is 744 million including 413 million for the spacecraft 
and its instruments

israelis are becoming increasingly jittery 
about iraqs military expansion worrying that saddam hussein will 
try to make good on threats to use chemical weapons against the 
jewish state 
some israelis are stockpiling canned goods in their attics 
since the persian gulf conflict has triggered memories of being 
under siege by arab armies others are trying to purchase gas masks 
most are glued to their radios and eager to see their superpower 
ally the united states put an end to the invasion 
defense minister moshe arens warned wednesday that an iraqi 
attack on israel is not impossible 
we have heard his saddams threats and we know he carries 
out his threats as he did with kuwait arens said but im 
sure he knows that israel is not kuwait and not saudi arabia 
therefore i think that the chance he will do such a thing is not 
very high 
arens said israel has not been asked to help in the usled 
multinational force to deter iraqi aggression but he said israel 
would respond positively if the united states asked to use its 
landing facilities 
arens of the rightwing likud bloc has repeatedly warned that 
israel will take action if saddam sends forces into neighboring 
jordan he has called saddam a little hitler 
even dovish legislators have thrown their support behind arens 
iraqs action has surprised many and people talk about it all 
the time said benjamin beithallahmi a psychologist at haifa 
university it is clear this has made many fear there could be a 
war hes got missiles and planes everyone would love to see this 
whole crisis come to an end 
iraq which boasts a 1millionstrong army is israels most 
formidable arab foe it has a powerful air force and weapons 
arsenal that includes nonconventional arms 
on wednesday iraqs military command claimed israeli warplanes 
had been painted in american colors and readied for an attack on 
iraq the iraqi command warned that iraq would respond to any 
aggressive act by israel wherever iraqs long arm may reach to 
strike its targets 
four months ago saddam said he would torch half of israel with 
binary chemical weapons if israel attacked his country 
israeli officials denied the iraqi allegations 
this is another lie that the president saddam hussein of iraq 
is using to advance his aggressive aims the israeli military 
command said in a statement 
an army spokesman refused to say whether the army has been put 
on alert following the iraqi announcement 
most israeli observers agreed that the iraqi announcement was 
aimed at winning sympathy in the arab world while deterring the 
united states from attacking iraq 
adding to israels concern is the alliance saddam has forged 
with king hussein of jordan the arab country with the longest 
common border with israel israeli reports say hussein recently 
allowed iraqi warplanes to fly menacingly close to israels 
frontier 
the invasion of kuwait last thursday made iraqs threat loom 
larger compounding the israelis preoccupation with security that 
is fueled daily by the palestinian uprising 
israeli generals held an emergency meeting last weekend and 
decided to step up the distribution of gas masks nationwide 
israeli media reported 
but some israelis are too anxious to wait for armyissued 
equipment miriam sterman a jerusalem homemaker and mother of 
four told a reporter she would try to buy her own masks 
ms sterman reacted to reports that iraq was loading chemical 
weapons onto warplanes in response to a us military buildup in 
saudi arabia 
hannah ilan another jerusalem resident has asked her husband 
to buy cartons of flour sugar canned milk and a sesame paste 
called tehina which is a popular middle east food 
mrs ilan explained that she survived two sieges of jerusalem 
one was in the 1948 middle east war when palestinian fighters 
choked all supplies to the city for weeks the other was in 1967 
when she spent most of the weeklong war in a shelter with three 
children including an infant 
those memories haunt me i hear theres a war going on around 
here so all i worry about is having enough in the house mrs 
ilan said 
many feel consoled that the military action is happening far 
from israels borders kuwait is 800 miles away 
analysts also note that israels military strength would likely 
deter saddam from attacking the jewish state 
but there is also some disappointment at seeing the united 
states unable to put a swift end to the crisis said mark heller 
an expert on iraq at tel aviv university 
there is this hope expectation that the us will give them 
the iraqis a slap in the face he said

president bush said wednesday he dispatched 
american troops on a dangerous mission to the persian gulf to 
protect saudi arabian oilfields and ward off a threat to americas 
economic independence he warned iraqs saddam hussein a 
line has been drawn in the sand 
bush said were not in a war and he called the us effort 
wholly defensive he offered no guess as to when the operation 
might end 
he demanded iraqs immediate complete and unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait the little oil state saddams armies 
overran last week 
laying out reasons for the largest deployment outside this 
hemisphere since the vietnam war bush said america imports half 
its oil from abroad and could face a major threat to its economic 
independence if saddam an aggressive dictator manages to 
take over the oilfields of the persian gulf 
the president reached out to unlikely international partners in 
his bid to squeeze iraq secretary of state james baker told 
reporters the soviet union had dispatched naval forces to the 
persian gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce a un 
trade embargo 
baker also said he was dispatching an aide to syria to see if 
we can coordinate and added the united states has been in touch 
with iran through third party contacts both nations are bitter 
foes of iraq but syria is on the official state department list 
of states supporting terrorism and iran has long been accused of 
pulling the strings behind the holders of american hostages in 
beirut 
the presidents decision won quick support from members of 
congress but some worried whether other countries would join in 
the stopiraq action i hope we will not be the lone ranger 
like we were in vietnam said sen alan cranston dcalif 
bushs appeals to other nations to commit their armies to a 
multinational defense of the saudis met a tepid public response 
only britain joined in wholeheartedly 
however congressional sources who asked not to be identified 
said several hundred soldiers from other persian gulf countries 
already in saudi arabia under the auspices of the gulf cooperation 
council had been moved into position to cooperate with us and 
saudi forces 
rep ike skelton dmo said following a briefing by defense 
department officials it appears this is a very strong 
multinational effort but he declined to be more specific about 
the origins of the force 
as a tense president spoke to the nation government sources 
said at least 5000 paratroopers from the 82nd airborne and other 
units were en route or already taking positions on saudi soil 
backed by an armada of air and seapower armed to the hilt 
by evening one pentagon source said the military movement was 
expected to last several days at least the source said the 
troop movements had encountered no difficulties 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff peeled away some of the secrecy from the 
operation while keeping quiet about the size of the us 
commitment 
powell told reporters ground forces had taken up position on 
saudi soil and he said the aircraft carrier uss independence and 
its support ships were stationed just outside the persian gulf in 
position to choke off iraqi trade lines 
the us contingent included 140 jet fighters and bombers as 
well as battleships that carried 32 tomahawk cruise missiles 
programmed to destroy specific targets in iraq military sources 
said 
you can be sure that for the mission we have been given we 
will put in adequate forces powell said the battletested 
iraqis he said are not invincible they are not ten feet tall 
diplomatic sources in the mideast reported that hundreds of us 
marines were airlifted early wednesday to near khafji an 
oilterminal saudi town near the kuwaiti border khafji is the site 
of the japaneseowned arabian oil co there was no immediate 
confirmation in washington 
bush seemed tense when he went on television at 9 am edt for a 
10minute speech but he appeared more relaxed although tired 
three hours later at a news conference he stumbled over his words 
occasionally 
no one commits americas armed forces to a dangerous mission 
lightly he said the american forces will not initiate 
hostilities but they will defend themselves he said 
instead of trying to evict iraqi forces from kuwait by military 
action bush expressed hope that a undirected worldwide trade 
embargo of iraqi oil could force saddam into submission he hinted 
that a blockade of iraqi ports usually considered an act of war 
might be forthcoming if the embargo proves ineffective 
the stakes are high the president said iraq is already a 
rich and powerful country that possesses the worlds second largest 
reserves of oil and over a million men under arms its the fourth 
largest military in the world 
baker who flew to turkey said he was carrying assurances of 
financial and military support for its forthright closing of an 
iraqi oil pipeline and for freezing iraqi assets earlier 
government sources said the turks were seeking 2 billion to 
compensate them for revenue lost by cutting off iraqs oil exports

denouncing three teenage defendants as rapists 
and wouldbe killers the prosecutor in the central park jogger 
case summed up the case wednesday by asking jurors to imagine the 
victims terror 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer stressing charges 
of rape and attempted murder repeatedly referred to the woman who 
was gangraped and bashed repeatedly with a brick the night of 
april 19 1989 while out for her nightly run 
after they finished beating and raping her they left her 
bleeding and unconscious in the most desolate part of the park 
lederer said they werent satisfied with raping her they 
demonstrated an intent to kill her 
she asked the jury to convict yusef salaam 16 raymond santana 
15 and antron mccray 16 in the attack on the jogger and attacks 
on two male joggers during a gang rampage through central park the 
three are charged with attempted murder rape sexual abuse riot 
assault and robbery 
after lederers final argument justice thomas galligan began 
his charge to the jury deliberations were to begin thursday 
earlier about 10 minutes into lederers summation about a 
dozen relatives and supporters of the defendants walked out of the 
courtroom together 
lederer continued speaking and the jury showed no reaction as 
the group exited the supporters then stood humming a spiritual and 
praying in a circle outside the courtroom 
galligan subsequently banned them from the courtroom 
lederer asked jurors to imagine what went through the mind of 
the jogger as the attackers surrounded her and started ripping 
off her clothes 
these defendants wanted her to die and they took the steps to 
make that happen the prosecutor said these defendants had 
every reason for not wanting her to survive 
lederer challenged each defendants claim that his statement was 
improperly taken and that police lied about interrogation 
procedures 
referring to yusef salaams contention that he was tricked into 
confessing the crime lederer noted his confidence when he 
testified 
this is not a person who is manipulated this not a person who 
has words put in his mouth lederer said 
lederer disputed a defense argument that a lack of blood on the 
teenagers clothing indicated they had nothing to do with the 
attack the jogger lost at least threefourths of her blood in the 
assault 
lederer said the jogger was found a short distance from where 
her assailants left her to die 
the defendants dragged her into the cover of darkness about 
78 feet into the woods off a paved drive where they beat and raped 
her lederer said 
still thrashing because of neurological reflex she lost that 
blood while rolling down to the path 
there was no reason their clothes should be bloody lederer 
said she was bleeding from her head these defendants didnt 
come into contact with her head they were raping her 
defense lawyers made their final appeals to the jury on tuesday 
with one attorney suggesting the victim was not gangraped while 
another accused detectives of lying about how incriminating 
statements were obtained from the three defendants those 
statements are the prosecutions chief evidence 
salaams attorney robert burns said unanswered questions about 
the womans sex life raised doubts about whether she was raped at 
all 
the 30yearold jogger is back at work as a vice president at 
the salomon brothers investment banking firm she testified that 
she still suffers from impaired sight balance and smell as a 
result of the attack

mexico said wednesday it plans to increase oil 
exports to the united states by 100000 barrels a day for two 
months to help compensate for the the loss of us imports from 
iraq and kuwait 
mexican foreign secretary fernando solana said the gesture was 
being made in the interests of benefiting an important and 
friendly client 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said the action exemplifies 
the spirit of relations between the two countries 
solana and brady spoke to reporters at the conclusion of 
daylong discussions between mexican and american officials held 
under the auspices of the usmexico binational commission 
after the iraqi military takeover of kuwait president bush 
imposed an embargo on imported oil from both countries according 
to us government figures the united states imported about 
600000 barrels a day from iraq and about 117000 from kuwait 
total daily us imports average an estimated 8 million barrels 
a day solana indicated that the mexican increase would have been 
higher but that oil production in mexico is running virtually at 
capacity 
last year mexico exported 763000 barrels a day to the united 
states out of total production of more than 25 million barrels 
about half mexicos production is exported 
this aid by mexico is much appreciated at this time brady 
said 
while the us stands to benefit from increased supplies 
mexico in turn will receive increased revenues from the expanded 
oil exports as well as a bonus from the higher prices that have 
resulted from the international embargo of kuwaiti and iraqi oil 
at the ceremonial opening of wednesdays discussions secretary 
of state james a baker iii joined forces with solana in condemning 
the iraqi conquest of kuwait and they demanded an immediate 
withdrawal of iraqi forces 
baker said completion of a free trade agreement and continued 
progress in the war against narcotics trafficking are two of the 
major challenges the united states and mexico face 
trade officials from both countries recommended to president 
bush that the two countries open negotiations on a freetrade 
agreement bush was pleased by the recommendation said spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
fiztwater said in a statement such an agreement could create a 
more prosperous trade and investment relationship between the two 
countries 
the united states and canada negotiated a similar agreement in 
1988 removing almost all trade barriers between the two countries 
baker said cooperation in combatting the drug trade has been 
better this year than at any time in history 
for his part solana said mexico is willing to multiply its 
economic contacts with the united states we believe that a fair 
free trade agreement would be a major step in that direction 
solana touched only briefly on the drug issue in his remarks 
according to us officials the priority mexico has given to this 
issue is reflected in increased cocaine seizures an estimated 
26500 pounds over the last six months most as a result of joint 
mexicanamerican operations 
in addition mexico is pleased that the united states is 
increasingly accepting mexicos view that the us government 
should do more to reduce demand for narcotics 
more than 150 representatives from the two countries attended 
this years meeting of the binational commission the size of the 
delegations reflects the broad array of cross border issues on the 
bilateral agenda

longtime middle east adversaries syria and iran seeking 
potential partners to counter iraqs aggression in the persian gulf 
the dramatic moves were announced by secretary of state james a 
baker iii as he flew to turkey with assurances to that nation of 
financial and military support for its forthright closing of 
two iraqi oil pipelines and for freezing iraqi assets 
us government sources said turkey was seeking 2 billion to 
compensate it for revenue it will lose by closing the pipelines 
before stopping at a portugese air base in the azores for 
refueling baker also said he had received new assurances of soviet 
support in enforcing an economic boycott of iraq ordered by the 
united nations security council 
baker told reporters traveling with him he would send john h 
kelly assistant secretary of state for the near east to damascus 
from ankara to see if we can coordinate with the syrians on 
collective efforts against iraq 
at the same time baker verified reports that the united states 
also has been in touch with iran through third party contacts 
the enmity between the syrian and iraqi governments is intense 
with the only possible greater enmity being that between iran and 
iraq syria helped iran in irans long and bloody eightyear war 
started by another invasion of iraqi president saddam hussein in 
1980 
syrian president hafez assad and saddam hussein are longtime 
rivals within the arab world the two nations are ruled by rival 
arab socialist parties each considering the other an outcast 
apart from that conflict syrias relationship with the united 
states has been as bad as us reations with iraq in fact syria 
is one of six countries listed by the state department as 
sponsoring terrorists acts iraq was removed from that list several 
years ago 
terrorist groups believed to be under the influence of iran are 
holding six americans hostage in lebanon the longest since 1985 
baker declined to say what collective efforts syria and the 
united states might undertake against iraq 
i really dont want to get into the specifics of that he 
said 
baker talked for about a half hour by telephone with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze their third conversation 
in two days the secretary then said they continue to support 
enforcement of the un resolution we can look toward continued 
soviet cooperation to carry out the resolution 
baker said moscow had dispatched naval forces to the persian 
gulf for use in any international blockade to enforce the sanctions 
approved unanimously monday by the un security council 
kelly who was flying to turkey with baker will go on to saudi 
arabia whose oil fields the us is protecting with thousands of 
troops dispatched wednesday kelly will meet with ousted leaders of 
the kuwaiti government who were given sanctuary in saudi arabia 
and with saudi officials 
a senior us official who demanded anonymity said was up to 
saudi arabia to decide whether syria and iran could participate in 
defense of the kingdon against iraq iran has mounted terrorist 
operations against saudi arabia in the past according to saudi 
officials

by sea and air american paratroopers seamen and fighter pilots 
plunged into the gathering storm of the middle east on wednesday to 
defend the saudi oil kingdom against any attack by a powerful 
expansionist iraq 
just six days after invading kuwait the iraqis proclaimed they 
had annexed that wealthy persian gulf nation and iraqs president 
saddam hussein sounded unafraid of the us superpower 
all the fleets and squadrons of aircraft will not shake a 
single palm frond in iraq said a statement by saddams ruling 
council 
in washington president bush warned the iraqis that a line 
has been drawn in the sand in saudi arabia where the first 
aircraft and ground forces of a us expeditionary force took up 
positions wednesday 
the united states also turned to two of its longtime middle east 
adversaries syria and iran seeking partners to counter iraqs 
aggression 
egypt announced that an emergency arab summit would convene in 
cairo thursday to discuss the crisis 
the potential for further explosions in the arabian desert sent 
new tremors through the middle east and around the world 
hundreds of americans and other foreigners streamed to airports 
in saudi arabia to get out of the country american officials again 
expressed concern about more than 3000 us citizens stranded 
and possibly detained in iraq and kuwait dozens of oil tankers 
their masters fearful of conflict stood anchored outside the 
persian gulf 
as gis packed up for the 5000mile journey to the persian gulf 
and the uncertain days ahead americans wondered whether they were 
headed into war 
angela nelson was to wed an 82nd airborne division soldier on 
saturday in michigan but he was recalled for duty in saudi arabia 
its scary she said not just for my wedding but for the 
country 
saddam said his 100000man invasion force seized kuwait last 
week because the emirate had wronged iraq by overproducing oil 
driving down world prices and iraqi revenues and by demanding 
repayment of huge loans it made to iraq he also reasserted 
longstanding iraqi territorial claims on kuwait 
in announcing the abrupt annexation wednesday the iraqis 
claimed that history has proved that kuwait is a part of iraq 
but bush in a white house address televised to the nation 
declared that history had instead proven that we must resist 
aggression or it will destroy us 
saddam disclaims any design on vast saudi arabia which borders 
both kuwait and iraq refugees filtering out of kuwait say the 
dugin iraqi troops are in seemingly defensive positions 
american officials said however they considered the iraqi army 
an imminent threat to saudi arabia and said intelligence 
reports indicate the the iraqis are in offensive formations 
the united states rushed to saudi arabias side bush said 
because the american economy heavily dependent on imported oil 
would be threatened if saddam an aggressive dictator took 
over gulf oilfields 
bush who demanded an immediate unconditional and complete 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait later told reporters us forces 
would not try to drive the iraqis out of that country the gis are 
there primarily to defend saudi arabia he said and he hoped the 
global un trade embargo ordered monday would pressure saddam into 
a kuwait pullout 
american officials provided few public details of the strength 
and timetable of the us military deployment in saudi arabia 
at least 5000 ground troops were involved us sources said 
along with 140 f15s f16s and other jet fighters and bombers 
besides the 82nd airborne pentagon sources said bush ordered 
elements of the 101st airborne division and the 24th infantry 
division mechanized to duty in saudi arabia the 101st is 
equipped with attack helicopters that could be launched against 
advancing tanks 
in addition 4000 us marines were flown to saudi arabia and 
some units were deployed near the oilterminal town of khafji 
which abuts the border of iraqioccupied kuwait mideast diplomatic 
sources said and five us air force awacs reconnaissance planes 
were arriving wednesday in saudi arabia said gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
the bush administration called the intervention a 
multinational effort but few other governments climbed aboard 
immediately egypt and morocco denied reports by us sources that 
they had agreed to send troops to saudi arabia only the british 
said they would send unspecified military forces 
but egypts president hosni mubarak said egyptians might later 
take part in an allarab force meanwhile the sixnation gulf 
cooperation council an alliance of arab emirates condemned the 
iraqi aggression raising the possibility that the smaller oil 
states might join the usled force a brigade of troops from the 
emirates was already in saudi arabia 
secretary of state james a baker iii flying to turkey with 
assurances of financial and military support for ankaras closing 
of two iraqi oil pipelines told reporters he would send john h 
kelly assistant secretary of state for the near east to damascus 
to see if we can coordinate with the syrians on collective 
efforts against iraq 
at the same time baker verified reports that the united states 
also has been in touch with iran through third party contacts 
the enmity between the syrian and iraqi governments is intense 
with the only possible greater enmity being that between iran and 
iraq 
not all arabs condemn iraqs takeover of kuwait in 
iraqialigned jordan for example the moslem brotherhood movement 
the strongest bloc in the parliament called on arabs to stand 
firmly against american interests 
gen powell said in washington that the iraqis hardened by a 
recent eightyear war with iran are not invincible they are not 
10 feet tall 
but the several thousand us troops reported being deployed in 
the 100degree heat and blowing sands of saudi arabia would be no 
match for the large iraqi invasion units in kuwait or the 
millionman iraqi army that backs them up 
the best immediate us weapon appeared to be the economic 
embargo which had already cut off much of iraqs allimportant oil 
exports 
global solidarity looked unlikely however two examples 
indonesia said it would continue trading with iraq the 
netherlands a us ally said it would allow a dutch dredging 
company to continue work to enlarge an iraqi port on the gulf 
bush said additional steps might be needed an allusion to 
a naval blockade of iraq orchestrated by the united states 
the necessary us warships were assembling nine us navy 
vessels are now patrolling the persian gulf iraqs only direct sea 
outlet and a 15ship task force led by the aircraft carrier uss 
independence was just outside the mouth of the strategic waterway 
in addition the carrier eisenhower accompanied by five other 
warships passed through the suez canal on wednesday en route to 
the gulf

about 4000 us marines were flown 
to saudi arabia and marine contingents were deployed thursday near 
khafji close to the kingdoms border with iraqioccupied kuwait 
according to diplomatic sources 
the sources speaking on condition they not be identified said 
the marines reached the area early thursday morning they did not 
say how they were flown in or give other details of the airlift 
the sources said no us military planes had been landing at 
dhahrans international airport on thursday but could be landing at 
other air strips 
pentagon sources in washington had reported that the american 
planes and men would be flown to riyadh the capital and dhahran 
on the persian gulf coast 
the diplomatic sources said they did not know how far the 
marines were from the khafji oil terminal site of the arabian oil 
co a japanese concern 
executives in khafji said that from their location they were not 
aware of any extraordinary activities 
the oil terminal lies 18 miles south of town and the border 
the report of a marine deployment in the oilrich northeast 
corner of saudi arabia was not immediately confirmed in washington 
where president bush announced tuesday he had ordered ground and 
air forces to saudi arabia to defend the kingdom against any iraqi 
aggression 
american sources in washington said about 5000 ground troops 
and 140 warplanes would be involved but one diplomatic source in 
the region said two us army divisions about 30000 troops were 
on their way to saudi arabia the us sources had said elements of 
three divisions not necessarily the entire divisions would be 
sent to saudi arabia but the discrepancy in reports could not 
otherwise be immediately reconciled 
associated press photographer greg english reported after flying 
over the strait of hormuz that about 30 oil tankers were anchored 
outside the strait about double the number over the weekend 
english said few vessels ventured into the persian gulf itself 
the whole of the southern gulf seemed like it had been 
deserted overnight he said 
during an extensive morning overflight of the southern gulf 
english reported sighting only one norwegianflagged tanker sailing 
out and one french warship 
shipping executives said that only ships with very strict 
schedules or those that had been there already were inside the 
gulf they said those outside were the ones that were told they 
could wait for further instructions 
loading at the main saudi oil terminal of ras tanura was normal 
but one executive pointed out that the vessels were moving 
cautiously and more slowly than usual 
loading was canceled however at dubais jebel ali terminal 
where ships were told that due to situation in gulf loading will 
not continue the executives said 
jebel ali cargo includes stored iraqi oil products

a quartermillion motorcyclists have 
converged on this small black hills town to enjoy races tours and 
general good times 
the weeklong 50th black hills motor classic has turned the town 
of 7000 on the edge of western south dakotas black hills into a 
motorcycle mecca 
its great mind blowing marguerite mcneill of queensland 
australia said tuesday it seems to have all ages it doesnt 
matter what or who you are 
motorcycles are parked on the six blocks of main street that 
have been blocked off to other traffic bikes are parked on both 
sides of the street and in double rows down the middle of every 
block 
the visitors included lawyers bankers police officers doctors 
and housewives 
this is just unreal to see this many people said burt 
trumbower wearing leather and a diamond stud in his left ear as 
he surveyed main street trumbower 45 a postal inspector from st 
paul minn was attending his 17th rally 
two wedding parties zoomed up and down the streets and another 
couple was observed taking vows in a nearby park with a bearded 
leatherclad man officiating 
some attending the rally belong to established groups such as 
hells angels banditos and sons of silence 
the rally started small in 1940 and was dedicated to tours and 
races the races are still held but over the years the parties 
have taken precedence 
i bet most people dont know the races go on said bruce 
hubbard president of the black hills motor classic board which is 
part of the local chamber of commerce they just come to ride 
their bikes maybe drink a couple of beers and talk to their 
buddies 
the gathering officially began monday but bikers began arriving 
last week along with extra law enforcement offiicers the rally 
runs through sunday 
the rallys relatively mellow mood was broken tuesday night when 
police shot and killed a man whod broken into a home after 
pounding a knife blade about 2 feet through a door authorities 
said the man also had threatened at least one other person and 
caused other disturbances said mike jackley meade county states 
attorney 
authorities would not release the mans name 
this is a very isolated incident said jackley theres no 
good rational explanation for it id say from the reports ive 
seen he definitely was not acting rationally 
for the most part the crowd is friendly said harold sykora 
chairman of a task force of state agencies providing support 
services for the rally 
they seem to be polite if you bump into someone on the 
street theyll say excuse me and be on their way people come 
here to have a good time sykora said

irancontra arms scandal says he has no political aspirations 
for now 
north told the loudoun va timesmirror in an interview 
published wednesday that hes formed an educational foundation that 
will deal with politics on a grassroots level 
but the retired marine lieutenant colonel told the newspaper 
i have no political aspirations of my own 
he added however my daddy used to tell me never say 
never

guardian technologies international inc which manufactures 
bulletproof vests 
i wear one every time im out in public he said 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington last month set 
aside all three of norths convictions in the irancontra case

been improper use of testimony north gave congress under a grant of 
partial immunity 
the court dismissed outright one count citing faulty 
instructions from the judge

take my flight please says a commuter airline 
which is putting comedians in the cabin to lighten up the short hop 
between cleveland and detroit 
on a flight too quick for work or napping comedian don tersigni 
reminded the crowd wednesday on continental express 50minute 
flight to detroit if you dont like my act where are you going 
to go 
the detroit entertainer then launched into sylvester stallone 
and elvis presley impersonations with a bit of improvising 
i couldnt hear myself really he said especially doing 
impressions i was just sort of winging it 
said boston businessman william stadler at least it wasnt 
boring 
its a good way to spend a short flight said robert 
anderson an architect from the detroit suburb of st clair shores 
who flies to cleveland weekly 
the commuter airline on monday launched a week of inflight 
business talks and comedy to publicize the detroit route it started 
in february detroit is one of 15 cities the airline serves from 
cleveland 
but for standup comics some flights force a change of style 
comic al aprill did sitdown comedy when flight 4454 en route to 
cleveland experienced turbulence monday night 
i was told our comedian does a real good job said capt 
bill daly im sorry i cant let him stand up 
earlier wednesday most of the 17 passengers on the 30seat 
plane stayed awake to hear detroit free press assistant business 
editor nunzio lupo give a 20minute talk on the labor negotiations 
going on between the big three automakers and the united auto 
workers union 
passengers applauded lupo after the flight and perhaps more 
importantly listened to the airlines emergency instructions 
in the morning its really hard theyll sleep or read their 
paper they dont listen to my demo said flight attendant lisa 
lyons of erie pa 
detroit dentist frank markie said lupos talk shortens the 
time and that flights are usually pretty boring 
the morning airborne business briefings and evening flights with 
comedians have been popular enough that the continental airlines 
commuterfeeder line may try them on other routes spokeswoman 
nancy compel said 
its a lot different than entertaining a nightclub crowd 
tersigni said

quebec has asked the federal government to 
send in soldiers to ensure public security in a monthlong 
armed standoff between mohawks and provincial police premier 
robert bourassa said wednesday 
in another development the mohawks and the federal government 
announced agreement on a mediator to bring the parties back to the 
bargaining table 
bourassa had given the mohawks a 48hour ultimatum that ran out 
wednesday to either resume talks or face unspecified consequences 
the dispute has polarized canadians spurring both sympathy 
protests by other indians and antiindian demonstrations 
at his news conference in quebec city bourassa said he wants 
the militarys role to be peaceful theres no question at this 
stage of an armed assault he said 
he did not say when or how many soldiers would move into the 
town of oka where police and mohawks have faced each other behind 
barricades since a gun battle july 11 
a policeman was killed during that fight which broke out when 
police stormed a barricade erected by mohawks to stop the expansion 
of a local golf course on land the mohawks claim as ancestral 
blame in that killing has not been established 
bourassa said the soldiers will back up provincial police 
because for the last month theyve had a very difficult job that 
theyve done very courageously 
calling in the army to oka 18 miles west of montreal does not 
mean that civil liberties are being curtailed bourassa said he 
said the military will take its orders from provincial police 
loran thompson a mohawk spokesman said he was not surprised 
nor overly concerned about the militarys arrival 
were hoping the army just stays out there and tries to 
maintain peace he said 
asked if the indians fear an assault thompson saidthats 
always possible but were advised that our men are ready if it 
comes to that 
there was no immediate comment on the military role from federal 
officials 
in separate remarks canadian prime minister brian mulroney said 
the negotiator in the dispute will be alan b gold chief justice 
of quebec superior court he said golds job will be to clarify 
any preconditions and having addressed these matters he will 
take steps for the commencement of substantive negotiations 
mohawk negotiator joe deom said in a statement that the indians 
had agreed to golds role but he added that nothing has 
changed in the mohawks demands 
the talks bogged down over the mohawks conditions free 
movement of food and mohawk advisers across the barricades and the 
presence of international observers 
deom said the mohawk barricades will remain during the talks 
federal officials plan to buy the disputed land to block the 
golf course addition

pakistans new leader said wednesday 
he will hold elections in october but ousted prime minister 
benazir bhutto raised doubts about that promise and the future of 
democracy in the country 
after ms bhuttos government was abruptly dismissed monday 
president ghulam ishaq khan set new elections for oct 24 he 
accused the government of corruption and nepotism 
on wednesday acting prime minister mustafa jatoi the former 
opposition leader said he intends to carry out the plan for 
october voting 
elections is our priority said jatoi speaking to reporters 
for the first time since taking office i unequivocally declare 
that i will fulfill this promise 
he said an election commission had been formed and had begun to 
set the timetable for the balloting 
however ms bhutto said she doubted elections would be held 
she predicted the military that has ruled pakistan for much of its 
43year history would soon seize power 
the caretaker government will not last within a few weeks 
the army will take over ms bhutto said at a news conference in 
her hometown of karachi 
she also said the military had threatened to take over unless 
the president dismissed her government 
the army denied her allegations and jatoi told reporters he was 
astonished by the former prime ministers remarks 
the army has played a positive role in helping to restore 
democracy he said this is her expression of gratitude 
ms bhutto inherited the political mantle of her father the 
late prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto he was ousted by gen 
mohammad zia ulhaq in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later 
zia himself was killed in a mysterious plane crash on aug 17 
1988 his death led to the first democratic elections after more 
than a decade of military rule 
when ms bhutto led her party to victory and took office in 
december 1988 she pledged to restore democracy 
diplomats and political analysts also voiced skepticism 
wednesday about the date of elections pointing out that the 
interim administration is comprised largely of ms bhuttos 
fiercest critics 
they also cited the threat of war with neighboring india over 
the disputed territory of kashmir 
the us ambassador to pakistan robert oakley said october 
elections were not certain 
i agree there is a question mark oakley said at a seminar 
i retain the same feeling at the moment that the chances are 
reasonably good 
but he added theres always the impact of whether a 
government is true to its words 
the president dismissed ms bhuttos government citing a long 
list of charges ranging from official greed to misuse of power she 
has repeatedly denied the allegations saying anyone with proof 
should take it to court 
corruption is endemic in pakistan but jatoi said it had 
flourished at unprecedented levels during ms bhuttos 
administration 
rampant corruption and the complete breakdown of law and order 
necessitated the presidents constitutional action he said 
the priorities of my government are going to be to continue the 
democratic process while cleansing our society of the negative 
influences of the past 20 months 
accountability in accordance with law is the demand of the 
people and will also be initiated he said those who looted 
and plundered the economy of the nation and the treasury cannot go 
scotfree 
he said tribunals would be set up to investigate the charges and 
empowered to disqualify candidates from election and assess 
punishment 
however he said there would be no witch hunt against the former 
government

us warplanes and combat troops backed by an 
armada of navy ships have taken up defensive positions in and near 
saudi arabia us military officials said wednesday some air 
national guard units were called up for active duty 
defense secretary dick cheney described the deployment as a 
major commitment of us forces that included elements of the 
82nd airborne division and f15 fighter jets he declined to 
provide specifics citing security concerns 
terming the military situation uncertain after iraq 
president saddam husseins act of infamy in invading kuwait 
cheney indicated american forces could be in the region for months 
about 5000 ground troops and more than 100 f15 fighter planes 
were ordered to the region congressional and pentagon sources 
reported and 4000 marines were said by diplomatic sources to have 
been moved close to the saudikuwait border nearly 40 warships and 
escort vessels some armed with sophisticated cruise missiles 
programmed to destroy specific iraqi targets will be in mideast 
waters by next week the sources said 
what was announced in washington was evidently only part of the 
story reports of other troop movements arrived throughout the day 
gov jim florio of new jersey announced in trenton that the 
170th air refueling group of his states air national guard had 
been called up gov mario cuomo of new york said his states 105th 
military airlift group which flew transport missions in the 
invasion of panama had been called to active duty with his 
agreement 
rep john spratt dsc said a10 airtoground attack jets 
from myrtle beach air force base had left for saudi arabia unlike 
the f15 an air superiority fighter designed to tangle with 
other planes the a10 was designed to attack ground targets and 
its sixbarrelled 30mm antitank cannon has been described as the 
best antitank weapon in the world 
diplomatic sources in saudi arabia said 4000 us marines had 
been deployed at khafji a saudi oilterminal town on the border 
with kuwait it was not known where they came from though marines 
had been based at diego garcia the us island bastion in the 
indian ocean about 1500 miles away 
one of the diplomatic sources said the us ground commitment 
would be 30000 
the movement of troops ships and planes will take several 
days at least said one pentagon source early wednesday evening 
this source speaking on condition of anonymity noted that most 
of the 82nd airborne division was still in the united states he 
did not however say how much of the division would be moved to 
saudi arabia 
the buildup appeared to be going well without major 
difficulties the source said 
at present two aircraft carriers bristling with 80 to 90 
aircraft each are within striking distance of iraqi targets 
another is on the way 
our purpose is to deter any further iraqi aggression 
cheney said he said he expected other nations to join the military 
effort but declined to name any except britain 
the mission of the armed forces is to take up defensive 
positions said gen colin powell the chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff 
powell expressed confidence american sailors soldiers and 
airmen were prepared for battle in the hostile desert environment 
if called upon 
weve trained for it weve exercised in it he said 
and while iraqs millionman army has been hardened by its 
eightyear war with iran he said they are not invincible they 
are not ten feet tall 
cheney and powell briefed a packed room of reporters in the 
pentagon standing in front of a map of the saudi region that 
identified some of the major us units that had been deployed but 
not all of them 
asked for information on us troop movements or the size of the 
sudden deployment powell replied simply you can be sure that 
for the mission we have been given we will put in adequate forces 
cheney and powell said the aircraft carrier uss independence and 
its support ships have taken up positions just outside the persian 
gulf and the carrier uss eisenhower is in the red sea not far 
from the end point of an iraqi oil pipeline and within range for 
the carriers aircraft and other weapons to engage iraqi forces 
powell said the troops brought with them protective clothing and 
medical supplies to be used in the event iraq uses chemical weapons 
against the american forces 
the briefing came after president bush delivered a nationally 
televised address announcing his decision to send us forces into 
the tense persian gulf region 
pentagon sources said the us arsenal will include heavy tanks 
dispatched aboard marine supply ships from the secret us 
facilities on the indian ocean island of diego garcia other 
supplies were en route from guam in the pacific the sources said 
the battleship wisconsin steaming across the atlantic with the 
aircraft carrier saratoga had 32 tomahawk cruise missiles 
programmed to destroy specific iraqi targets sources said 
and a second navy cruiser has been added to the navys task 
force in the persian gulf bringing the number of us ships in the 
strategic waterway to nine 
powell and cheney added that the aircraft carrier eisenhower 
accompanied by the warships scott and ticonderoga had gone through 
the suez canal on its way to the scene 
five awacs airborne warning and control aircraft sold to the 
saudis in the late 1970s had been put on station in central saudi 
arabia they said 
cheney said his discussion with the saudis on a quick visit 
earlier this week had also resulted in bushs waiver of a 
congressional limit on the transfer of f15 fighter jets to saudi 
arabia permitting a dozen of the sophisticated aircraft to be 
shipped to the kingdom

a federal immigration judge on wednesday 
granted permanent us residency to a soviet woman who was involved 
in a highly publicized custody battle with her american husband 
after a onehour hearing immigration officials agreed to drop 
efforts to deport inna yurevna carver to the soviet union 
the us immigration and naturalization service in january 
denied ms carvers request that it waive certain requirements for 
permanent residence 
first it was my love and dream to live here ms carver 27 
said after the hearing but i had also burned my bridges with 
russia i feel wonderful i love this country 
ms carver drew attention two years ago when she battled to gain 
custody of her 14monthold son tristan the baby and her 
estranged husband john paul carver were found in mexico in 1989 
a year after he took the baby 
carver was arrested in texas in march 1989 and given a oneyear 
deferred sentence last december for abandoning his wife and taking 
the baby 
a psychologist testified during custody proceedings that carver 
believed his former wife was involved in soviet espionage 
during wednesdays testimony ms carver said the only reason 
she came to the united states was her love and devotion to carver 
the two met and married in the soviet union in 1986 their son 
was born there in 1987 before the family moved to edmond okla 
later that year they were divorced in june 
she said her reasons for seeking divorce included physical and 
mental abuse 
i was never treated like this in my life ms carver said 
us immigration judge john duck denied several attempts by ins 
general counsel james reynolds to continue the hearing until carver 
could be present duck said he had reviewed past claims by carver 
and found them completely uncredible 
im not going to give a great bit of weight to what that man 
says duck said 
reynolds then agreed to drop the deportation case and told ms 
carvers attorney no appeals would be made 
ms carver said she will stay in norman work toward an 
education degree at the university of oklahoma and seek us 
citizenship 
i really feel a lot of relief she said i thought it 
would be a little more vicious

the soviet interior minister has recommended that 
president mikhail s gorbachev extend his thursday deadline for 
militants to disarm and disband 
vadim bakatin told the official news agency tass wednesday he 
was making the suggestion because new leaders have come to power in 
armenia which hosts the countrys biggest and most defiant force 
of militants 
gorbachev trying to quell ethnic violence that has shaken this 
multinational country declared july 26 that militants nationwide 
have 15 days to turn in their weapons 
but many militants especially those in armenia which is locked 
in a territorial dispute with neighboring azerbaijan have refused 
to comply with gorbachevs decree 
more than 200 people have been killed in ethnic clashes between 
armenians and azerbaijanis over control of the disputed territory 
of nagornokarabakh which azerbaijan has held since 1923 
soviet officials have warned that force would be used to 
confiscate any illegal weapons they can find after the deadline 
expired 
there was no immediate word whether gorbachev who is 
vacationing had agreed to bakatins recommendation the interior 
minister did not say how long the deadline should be extended 
the communist party daily pravda said wednesday that only a 
handful of the militants estimated thousands of weapons have been 
turned in 
the appeal to humanness and reason inherent in the demand to 
hand over arms and stop bloodshed did not find support among those 
who heighten criminal tensions in the country pravda said 
bakatin said about 1600 firearms and more than 100000 rounds 
of ammunition were voluntarily handed in or confiscated from july 
25 through wednesday 
in armenia 6700 firearms including 1200 submachine guns 
have been stolen this year pravda said 
the armenian parliament rejected gorbachevs order as 
interference in the republics internal affairs and has begun 
debating an independence declaration 
but bakatin appeared hopeful because of the election of a new 
president of armenia the president levon terpetrosyan arrived 
in moscow on wednesday for two days of talks with soviet and 
russian federation leaders on the weapons decree and other issues 
tass reported 
bakatin who met terpetrosyan on wednesday told tass until 
recently republican authorities did not take a constructive 
attitude however there are grounds to maintain that the political 
situation in the republic is changing 
hope has appeared that armenian authorities can resolve 
within a short period and on their own all tasks concerning 
the stabilization of the sociopolitical situation in the 
republic 
bakatin said the interior ministry consulted with armenias new 
leaders and that they agreed on the need to strengthen law and 
order protect citizens and rule out the unlawful bearing of arms 
terpetrosyan a leader of the armenian national movement told 
his republics parliament on tuesday that armenia could handle its 
own problems a response to kremlin threats to send in troops to 
enforce order if gorbachevs decree on weapons is ignored 
but it was unclear whether he would directly ask the militants 
to give up their weapons and if he did whether they would comply 
the soviet interior ministry faced a problem with another 
southern republic georgia georgian president givi gumbaridze told 
tass his republic would not enforce gorbachevs order until the 
republics parliamehnt ends its session on aug 17

the broadway production of the hit london 
musical miss saigon was canceled by its producer wednesday 
after an actors union refused to let a white british actor play 
the role of a eurasian 
miss saigon is dead for this season said richard maltby 
jr colyricist of the musical it would be hard to crank up 
again 
the decision by producer cameron mackintosh came after the 
unions council voted tuesday to bar english star jonathan pryce 
from repeating his portrayal of an amoral brothel owner 
the debate is no longer about the casting of miss saigon but 
the art of acting itself mackintosh said in a statement issued 
on behalf of the shows creative team 
the show which had been scheduled to open in march at the 
broadway theater is a love story set during the closing days of 
the vietnam war it had an advance ticket sale of more than 25 
million the largest in broadway history mackintosh said the money 
will be refunded 
he said an estimated 600000 spent on preproduction work for 
the show has been lost 
the shubert organization has turned down bookings of other 
productions in order to reserve the broadway theater for miss 
saigon and now has incurred a substantial loss as well 
mackintosh said 
pryce said he was shocked to learn the union had turned him down 
for the role 
once the shock has worn off i think im going to feel pretty 
angry about it he said 
mackintoshs action came after the council of actors equity 
voted on whether pryce a respected british performer who has 
appeared on broadway twice before should star in the american 
production of miss saigon 
the casting of a caucasian actor made up to appear asian is an 
affront to the asian community said alan eisenberg the unions 
executive secretary eisenberg said the unions decision was made 
in full awareness that many jobs may be lost to actors of asian 
background if the production is canceled 
the issue of lost money was really not a factor in 
discussions he added 
the economic impact could be enormous the trade newspaper 
variety calculated that the new york production of miss saigon 
alone would have employed about 182 people including 50 actors and 
stage managers 26 musicians and 34 stagehands the showbusiness 
weekly said payroll benefits would total more than 200000 a week 
i think actors equity misjudged cameron mackintosh maltby 
said they didnt understand that if the show wasnt done to 
camerons standards he just as soon not have it done 
mackintosh declined to take the matter to arbitration a process 
equity suggested tuesday might be the next step 
the controversy arose several weeks ago after actors equity 
received letters of complaint from playwright david henry hwang and 
actor bd wong about the casting of pryce 
ten days ago i informed actors equity that i would support 
whatever decision they determined to be in the best interests of 
their membership hwang author of the broadway hit m 
butterfly said wednesday it has certainly never been my 
intention to see a show canceled i simply felt that an important 
point had to be made and this has clearly been achieved

as president bush dispatched us troops to 
saudi arabia iraq turned over a 10yearold girl to us diplomats 
in baghdad but kept 38 other americans confined to a hotel under 
armed guard in what one official described as a potentially 
scary situation 
the girl penelope nabokov of albany calif was taken from the 
hotel to the us embassy by agreement with iraqi officials state 
department officials said wednesday night 
while the us concern was focused on the americans sequestered 
at the hotel rashid in baghdad the state department also was 
worried about the thousands of other americans in iraq and in 
iraqioccupied kuwait 
some americans reportedly have been the target of threats by 
iraqi forces in kuwait 
a week after the iraqi conquest of kuwait with borders in both 
countries and airports closed the americans were still not free to 
leave 
this raised concern in washington that iraqi authorities might 
find them politically useful at a time of escalating military 
tensions with the bush administration the state department has 
refused to call them hostages 
there are an estimated 3000 americans in kuwait and 400 in 
iraq 100 fewer than previous estimates 
bush told reporters that there had been some encouraging signs 
concerning the americans apparently referring to statements by 
iraqi officials that all would be allowed to leave 
but none of the statements have proved to be authoritative and 
us officials expressed frustration over the their inability to 
obtain a firm commitment from the iraqis to allow the americans to 
leave 
asked about the status of the 39 state department deputy 
spokesman richard boucher said their status is that they cannot 
leave the hotel grounds but they have full use of the facility 
there are armed guards located at the hotel but the americans have 
not been threatened 
boucher spoke before penelope was moved to the embassy the girl 
had been flying alone from her grandmother in france to join her 
mother in india when she and other passengers on a british airways 
plane were caught during a refueling stop by the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait last thursday 
one of the officials who disclosed her transfer to the embassy 
said he did not know where she would go next or when this official 
spoke on condition that his name not be used 
the top us diplomat in baghdad joseph wilson as well as 
other consular officials have met with the americans at the hotel 
that group includes the 11 oil workers who were taken from the 
border region in kuwait a few days ago 25 people brought by bus 
from kuwait city and three who were already at the hotel 
boucher said the iraqis have given contradictory statements 
concerning the americans in iraq and kuwait one explanation given 
for their lack of permission to leave is that the airport and the 
borders have been closed for security reasons said one official 
asking not to be identified 
american envoys also have been told that the granting of exit 
visas takes time the official said 
as for the reports of iraqi forces threatening people boucher 
said there is no evidence that americans or other foreigners are 
being singled out 
were certainly concerned about the incidents which have 
occurred and we have raised these with the iraqi government 
boucher said 
we have repeatedly reminded the iraqi government of their 
responsibility for the safety of americans and other foreigners 
and we expect the iraqi government to carry out its pledges to 
ensure the safety of foreigners and the security of diplomatic 
premises 
bush told reporters that he was concerned about the americans 
because of the unpredictable nature of iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
he said protection of american life was fundamental to my job 
and responsibilities as president

the deployment of us warplanes and lightly

private military analysts say 
the bush administration said it views the 100000 iraqi soldiers 
near the saudi border as an imminent threat to saudi security 
after the forces of president saddam hussein conquered tiny kuwait 
and its vast oil riches last week 
under the saudi desert lie the largest oil reserves in the world

the cutoff of oil from iraq is putting smiles on 
the faces of those in the struggling us oil industry 
houston americas energy capital has been crawling toward 
recovery after prices plunged in the 1980s iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and the un embargo on iraqi oil could speed things up 
us oil companies began last year to increase exploration 
budgets and new drilling and exploration techniques have brought 
about regional booms but a sustained increase in oil prices 
because of the persian gulf crisis could spur domestic drilling and 
attract investors scared off in the 1980s observers said 
there is an air of expectancy said john faulkinberry chief 
financial officer of paramount petroleum co an oil and gas 
exploration and production company this one event could really

vice presidents sometimes wind up on 
funeral duty but so far dan quayles specialty has been 
presidential inaugurations openings not endings 
maybe it reflects the generation gap 
quayle 43 represented the united states on tuesday at the 
inauguration of cesar gaviria 43 as president of colombia i am 
here for his inauguration to show the strong importance that the 
united states places on our continuing partnership with colombia 
quayle said 
change the country and the theme can work most anywhere 
in 18 months quayle has been at the inaugurations of six newly 
elected leaders in latin america all of them won free elections 
on a continent once dotted with dictatorships most are youthful a 
new generation of latin leadership 
that prompted quayle to remark in a dallas speech that his latin 
american travels sometimes made him feel like an elder statesman 
his stillsagging approval ratings in the public opinion polls 
dont make him look like one at home 
quayle is returning to washington tonight from colombia peru 
bolivia and haiti the stops on his seventh vice presidential trip 
to latin america and the caribbean those travels have taken him to 
17 latin nations among 29 he has visited as vice president 
his inaugural contacts sometimes prove valuable in bogota he 
met again with president carlos andres perez of venezuela whose 
second inauguration quayle attended just after his own they 
crossed paths at two other inaugurals since 
at the venezuelan embassy in bogota perez told quayle on 
tuesday that he would do everything he could with venezuelan oil 
and other opec producers to make up the shortfall left by the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 
the emphasis on central and south america wasnt designed for 
quayle he was no specialist and he does not speak spanish it 
took shape trip by trip as events required highlevel us 
representation at a time of upheaval in eastern europe and the 
soviet union the president and the secretary of state were focused 
elsewhere 
they still are quayle left a us capital gripped by the 
persian gulf crisis to fly to bogota in a show of support for 
colombias strong stand against the cocaine cartel and against drug 
terrorists 
and bush had just postponed indefinitely a fivenation south 
american trip of his own in midseptember it was called off 
because of budget deficit negotiations and other business at home 
so quayle has become the administrations point man in latin 
america its not a spectacular assignment but it is a valuable 
one for the administration said his spokesman david beckwith 
the low profile was evident when quayle visited bogota and spent 
nearly three hours at an outdoor inauguration in a plaza by the 
national congress building before bush went into cartagena 
colombia under heavy military guard for the feb 15 drug summit at 
an isolated naval base he said he wasnt doing anything stupid 
or macho quayles appearance in bogota obviously carried greater 
risks but nobody made much of it 
he was there for about eight hours touchdown to takeoff tuesday 
night in a capital that has seen violence lthough drug terrorism 
has centered elsewhere 
the vice presidents latin american missions clearly have been a 
plus although its not the kind of work likely to repair his 
domestic political image more people probably associate his 
travels with the false story that hed said he wished his 
knowledge of latin was better than with the favorable reviews he 
has drawn even from some democrats 
and it certainly beats funeral assignments quayle represented 
the government at one in central america as vice president bush 
led us delegations to the funerals of six foreign leaders three 
of them in moscow 
bush made the count seem higher with periodic bits of funereal 
humor 
you die we fly he said 
he also said that the funerals were useful you do get to meet 
firsthand these leaders and form a close personal relationship 
he said at one dinner during his vice presidential days many of 
these dead leaders have stayed in touch over the years 
its known as quiet diplomacy

millions of words have been written and spoken 
in praise of the federal reserves determination to conquer 
inflation and save the american economy from destruction 
those words are wasted on richard rahn though generally not 
outspoken economist rahn has declared himself forcefully on the 
subject testifying before congress that the central bank is 
inflations cause not its cure 
the central bank and only the central bank causes 
inflation he told congress earlier this summer 
rahn commented then that governors of the federal reserve were 
political appointees who acted secretly and without accountability 
to anyone he accused them of vagueness and even of misinformation 
now he accuses them of another economic crime that of commiting 
the economy to recession while the recession might not have begun 
yet rahn says it will be evident by the final quarter of this year 
and the first of 1991 
while some economists can be dismissed as publicity seekers 
being in the public eye is essential these days for an economist 
seeking the big money rahn must be listened to he speaks for the 
us chamber of commerce 
in his role as chief economist and vice president of that 
organization rahn has watched as the feds tight money policy 
squeezed small businesses which the chamber has courted in recent 
years 
some of those businesses that are being starved for credit 
supporters of fed policy have argued are speculative enterprises 
often in real estate or construction that should be allowed to die 
but other small companies are the opposite they are innovative 
they have good products markets and management today their ideas 
and products keep the big companies alert tomorrow they are 
themselves big companies 
many of these young companies also are being denied credit in 
part at least because of tight fed policies 
the fed he said has left no margin for error in aggressively 
pursuing its goal of inflation control mistakenly assuming that 
economic growth somehow produces inflation when the real reasons 
lie elsewhere 
rahn explained his thesis in his congressional testimony during 
which he stated that the nation has a fiat money system controlled 
by government and outside the control of the rule of law 
government he said retains monopoly control of money simply by 
spending it and then compelling the fed to accommodate the 
spending by manipulating the money supply to keep that spending 
from creating inflation 
the fed does this in part by cracking down on the economy and 
limiting its ability to grow the rationale being that 
privatesector growth atop the already heavy burden of government 
spending might strain economic capacity 
in rahns view the effort is futile he said as long as the 
government maintains a monopoly over money and relies on an 
unaccountable government central bank to manage that monoply 
inflation will persist 
in an effort to accommodate government and its spending 
proclivities he said the fed whipsaws the economy between 
inflation and recession rather than pursuing a longterm policy 
consistent with stable economic growth 
in the first instance inflation the fed enlarges the money 
supply to avert inflation in the second rahn suggests it 
overreacts to its own policy and cracks down with tight credit 
putting the economy into a tailspin 
get government spending in line and open up the feds 
activities to greater scrutiny says rahn require that fed policy 
be set and implemented in public 
and if recession does come as he forecasts dont swallow the 
explanation that it was caused by iraqi adventurism in the middle 
east blame it on bad economic policy he says

the persian gulf crisis has bruised stock and 
bond prices raised most interest rates and renewed fears of both 
a recession and higher inflation from a possibly explosive rise in 
oil prices 
what should the average investor do 
sit tight and see what happens in a few days the time to make 
decisions is when the markets are quiet not when theyre crazy 
says jay goldinger an investment counselor and principal of 
capital insight inc of beverly hills calif 
many other financial planners and strategists are saying the 
same thing to clients apparently over and over again as they 
report a steady rise in customer calls 
so far most individual investors seem to be heeding that advice 
although the stock and bond markets have fallen sharply since 
the aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq mutual fund managers say 
that havent seen a mass exodus of money from their funds which 
move in tandem with the markets some are even reporting buying 
interest among a few bargainhunting investors 
not surprisingly fund managers say interest has been 
particularly acute in the 52 inflationpegged gold and natural 
resources stock funds traded in the united states as their rates 
of return rise with the tensions in the persian gulf but some 
experts caution investors against shifting their money there 
it may be a little late said michael lipper president of 
lipper analytical services inc in new york which regularly tracks 
mutual funds 
lipper said only the most nimble of investors who are betting 
that oil prices will continue to increase might want to consider 
moving in then quickly cashing out 
but if thats their approach i dont think funds are the 
right way for them to go he said noting that most fund 
investors are usually in it for the long haul 
the iraqikuwait conflict has pushed up crude oil prices by more 
than 25 percent to levels not seen since the mid1980s that in 
turn helped depress stock and bond prices and pushed up interest 
rates as the markets worried about rising inflation and a recession 
during the week of the invasion natural resource funds most of 
which are oil based had a 319 percent rise in the average rate of 
return while goldrelated funds were up on average 389 percent 
according to lipper at the same time general equity funds were 
down 204 percent he said 
fidelity investments in boston said its four main gold or 
energyrelated funds remain standouts among its more than 180 
funds with rates of return between nearly 4 percent to nearly 6 
percent higher in just one week 
david mclaughlin a financial adviser with chase investment 
counsel in charlottesville va said investors considering buying 
into these funds as well as related individual stocks should do 
so as a hedge against inflation not as a change in strategy 
even then he advises dont buy your whole position all at 
once buy a little bit now and wait and see 
mclaughlin said now may be the time to pick up some highquality 
stocks of companies that can withstand economic changes consumer 
products and media stocks for example would fit that category 
goldinger recommends that those with extra cash consider 
treasury bills and notes with maturities of two years of less 
because money is locked in for a shorter time these securities are 
less susceptible to higher inflation and market volatility 
these days shortterm securities are offering rates that are 
highly competitive to those of longerterm bonds which earlier 
this week sustained their biggest selloff in nearly three years 
the yield on the twoyear treasury note for instance stood at 
798 percent on wednesday while the 30year bond yielded 881 
percent 
bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts also 
offer similar shortterm protection but banks have been lowering 
cd and money market rates according the most recent random check 
by the north palm beach fla publication bank rate monitor

stay out of the music scene for four years 
and look what happens 
british soul stylist paul young can tell you all about it after 
his third album between two fires ran its course in 1986 he 
slowed down to start a family he then took two more years to put 
together his latest album other voices 
while he was gone the motown sound returned to the charts with 
blueeyed soul singers and fellow brits at the helm george 
michael simply red and lisa stansfield young returned just in 
time 
people could say ive been away long enough to be forgotten 
he said in an interview in some territories it is long enough 
to be forgotten but in other territories its been a break and 
thats not such a bad thing 
young began other voices with the same staff he had used on 
his three previous albums but was unsatisfied with the results 
six months work as he said went down the pan 
so he started anew he brought in plenty of guest musicians 
pink floyds david gilmour on guitar singer chaka khan on backing 
vocals and stevie wonder on harmonica nile rodgers produced a 
track and two more were done with former j geils band leader 
peter wolf 
but young still felt he had to get back to his roots in britain 
and did some recording there as well 
working with peter i was coming up with music that was very 
different from what id done before much more american he said 
my biggest audience is in europe and i cant ignore that 
other voices is filled with material by other artists 
including covers of the chilites oh girl and frees a 
little bit of love young sees doing these songs as a way of 
distancing himself from his own material 
id like to forget that i wrote them and approach them as an 
arranger and then i could probably enjoy it more he said but 
underneath it theres always my song and so i see it one 
particular way that somehow stops me from doing certain things 
with other songs ive heard them one way i see them another 
way so straightaway ive got this choice of things i can do with 
it and i think that makes it more enjoyable 
he also sees doing covers as a way to keep great old songs 
alive but likes to look for the less wellknown standards 
i tend to prefer finding songs that are little gems in the 
dust as it were and making them out to be something special 
because maybe they the audience missed it the first time 
round he said 
i dont like a lot of music that loses track of its roots i 
hope that what im doing when i do these things is keeping the old 
stuff in their minds but keeping up to date in terms of how i work 
the arrangements what instruments i use stuff like that 
on other voices young said he went back to playing a lot 
of stuff live again and not using too much machinery i think the 
trick is to use the machinery but still make it sound very human 
songwriting is not his forte he said but hes looking to 
change that 
i think i was working with a guy who also found it very hard 
to be a songwriter and that made it even more difficult he said 
so now ive made some contacts with people who actually enjoy the 
process of being stuck in a room for eight hours which i dont 
find in the least bit inviting 
youngs solo career began in 1982 after 3 years with the soul 
outfit the qtips his first break came in 1983 with a version of 
the marvin gaye classic wherever i lay my hat which stayed at 
no 1 in england for three weeks his debut album no parlez 
also reached the top of the charts there 
his longawaited us success came with the top 20 song come 
back and stay also from no parlez but his second album 
the secret of association released in 1985 contained his 
first us no 1 hit everytime you go away written by daryl 
hall of hall and oates 
he doesnt necessarily see other voices as a progression 
but rather a beginning of new things 
i think ive now built myself another little base to work 
from he said its a pretty good mixture of what the last 
three albums had done and its now on one album theres quite a 
few indications of ways i could go

more money often singled out as the key to 
improving schools apparently in itself doesnt do the job 
thats the conclusion of two different recent studies one 
secular the other religious they say cohesive purpose less 
centralized bureacracy and parental choice are what count 
when it comes to education money is not the panacea many 
politicians and educators would have us believe says brother 
robert kealey chief researcher for a study by the national 
catholic educational association 
placing more trust in teachers and parents is the key 
this also is the general thrust of a recent study by the 
brookings institution of washington dc in calling for a 
reformed system open to parental choice of schools and competition 
among them 
money is not what makes some schools more effective than 
others says the study contending that reduced bureaucratic 
constraints and more freedom in decisionmaking about instruction 
and discipline are what gets better results 
the booklong study politics markets and americas 
schools by john chubb a brookings fellow and terry moe a 
stanford university political scientist says the us education 
system is hobbled by topheavy regulations 
private schools which outperform public schools on the 
average also tend to spend less than the public schools do in 
educating their students the study says they get better 
schools for less money 
that with figures to back it up also is the contention of a 
study by the ncea which compares consolidated financial figures 
from us catholic elementary schools and from the national center 
for education statistics 
they show that the catholic schools spent 1476 per pupil in 
198889 less than one half the 3977 perpupil cost for public 
school students in the 198687 academic year the latest overall 
statistics available 
the econmomies in the catholic school network are related most 
directly to the leadership responsibility placed in the hands of 
catholic school principals and teachers says sister catherine t 
mcnamee ncea president 
their empowerment and their success precludes the need for 
high administrative costs 
previous studies have found that catholic school students 
outperform their public school counterparts in reading mathematics 
and science tests 
the costs comparisons were based on data from 907 catholic 
schools representing more than 12 percent of all us catholic 
elementary schools and from national composites on public schools 
kealey executive director of the nceas elementary and 
secondary school department said the findings correspond with 
those of the brookings institution that greater expenditures 
dont insure more effectiveness 
the ncea noting that catholic parents pay school taxes just as 
do parents of students in public schools advocates tax credits to 
parents that would foster choice and competition among schools 
the competitive spirit will engender excellence and initiative 
keys to educational success sister mcnamee says 
the brookings study recommends a similar approach to financing 
in the form of scholarships 
it says the present public system is fundamentally flawed 
that americas children are not learning enough they are not 
learning the right things and most debilitating of all they are 
not learning how to learn 
the study says private schools tend to be more effective because 
they are not burdened by the bureaucracy and politics surrounding 
us public schools and their greater responsibility for decisions 
makes for clearer purpose 
the more school decisionmaking is constrained to 
superintendents district offices unions and the rules and 
regulations they promulgate the less effective the school 
organization is likely to be the study says 
extensive topdown control of schools is simply inconsistent 
with the development at the school site of leadership and teacher 
professionalism 
the catholic report says the present average tuition costs in 
catholic schools is 924 annually with the difference between that 
and per pupil expenditure of 1476 coming from parish or diocesan 
subsidies 
sister mcnamee says parents of catholic elementary students last 
year provided a financial gift to the nation of almost 8 
billion the costs of 7500 schools in which about 2 million 
students were enrolled 
the study notes the catholic schools are seeking added sources 
of income such as endowment or development funds and need to 
improve salaries and benefits for teachers 
catholic school teachers make an average 16000 annually while 
public school teachers make about 27000 the study says it says 
public elementary school principals make about 44000 while 
catholic school princiapls average about 26000

disagreement by the two sides 
over whether to kick dozens of allegedly corrupt officers out of 
the army could push el salvador into another round of civil war 
on july 26 government and rebel negotiators ended a third 
session of monthly unmediated peace talks with an accord on 
human rights they are to meet again friday in san jose costa rica 
julys agreements skirted armed forces reform the main item on 
the peace agenda and the key to ending a decadelong war that has 
killed an estimated 72000 people most of them civilians 
salvadorans barely recovered from the bloody rebel offensive of 
november 1989 are waiting for the other shoe a combat boot they 
expect will crash down in the next few weeks 
leftist rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
known as the fmln have warned of another major attack unless the 
government agrees to steps toward demilitarization 
acrimonious debate of the militarys role has occupied more than 
90 percent of the negotiating time and produced only cosmetic 
changes in positions with no agreement each side accuses the 
other of intransigence 
the army has been on alert since early july soldiers with 
assault rifles are everywhere on downtown and suburban streets 
patrolling or manning roadblocks 
forced recruitment of young men has increased soldiers 
routinely stop intercity buses to induct those who cannot prove 
they have served already 
last month citizens frightened by rumors of an imminent 
guerrilla offensive stocked up on beans a staple of the salvadoran 
diet driving up the price 
seven points are on the peace agenda but both sides agree the 
only really sticky one is what to do about the army 
el salvador has held periodic elections since 1982 and tried to 
consolidate some democratic institutions but the military retains 
tremendous influence 
the main obstacle to an armistice that would disband the fmln is 
the dispute over the rebels insistence that the high command be 
purged of officers they accuse of corruption and abusing human 
rights the government and armed forces say that would amount to 
interference with the military 
oscar santamaria the chief government negotiator said in an 
interview the fmln position appears designed to cripple the 
armed forces rather than to change or reform them 
president alfredo cristianis rightist government has proposed 
letting the armed forces police themselves the rebels say history 
shows the army cannot be trusted to do that 
despite evidence implicating the military in torture 
disappearances and thousands of murders no officer has been 
convicted of a crime involving the politically motivated abuse of 
human rights 
they are saying trust us were going to be good from now 
on said schafik handal a guerrilla commander and the chief 
rebel negotiator if we lay down our arms before agreeing on a 
purge and an end to military impunity there would be another 
bloodbath like that of the early 1980s 
guerrilla demands for a purge and a drastic reduction in the 
armys numerical strength have struck a chord in a people who 
traditionally view the army with a mixture of fear and contempt 
chafarote the popular term for soldier is a combination of 
words meaning falseness and filth 
i dont like the guerrillas but i completely agree with their 
demand for a purge and demilitarization said the owner of a tile 
factory the military has been a scourge for this country 
as often happens in this violent nation he asked that his name

sen christopher dodd a connecticut democrat who follows 
central american affairs closely said in july that 40 to 50 
salvadoran officers should be retired early or otherwise removed 
guerrilla spokesmen talk of purging 200 officers but that is 
seen as a negotiating figure subject to change the rebels demand 
only removal not trials and punishment 
col mauricio vargas a brigade commander and member of the 
government negotiating team agreed that the military could benefit 
from a change in its upper echelons but said the process must be 
gradual and internal 
he said in an interview that about 10 top officers could be 
removed in the next year but that a more drastic housecleaning 
would irreparably damage the command structure 
the united states provides about 1 million a day in economic 
and military aid to el salvador earlier this year the state 
department and us embassy appeared to be seeking some sort of 
military shakeup but recent comments indicate washington has eased 
the pressure

citizens of tver and dozens of other 
soviet cities are casting off the names and symbols of a painful 
past 
the people of this ancient city 100 miles northwest of moscow 
started by taking back the name it bore for centuries before stalin 
called it kalinin for a henchman born near tver 
to catherine the great the city was the most beautiful in the 
empire after st petersburg now leningrad because of its 18th 
century architecture as the namesake of mikhail kalinin it became 
a reminder of repression and death 
gorky street in moscow the capitals main thoroughfare has 
been changed back to tverskaya street fashionable shops and stores 
lined the street before the bolshevik revolution and outside the 
city it became the main road to tver 
on july 19 the front page of kalininskaya pravda the local 
newspaper carried a decree signed by boris n yeltsin president 
of the russian republic it said the republics presidium 
decrees rename the city kalinin to the city tver 
yeltsin had reversed half a century and fulfilled a dream of 
many residents 
a poem published with the decree said well goodbye kalinin 
you were just a pseudonym of our returning tver 
now even the newspaper will have to call itself something else 
the name game is sweeping this vast country for decades 
cities streets ships farms and factories were renamed for 
bolshevik heroes and officials 
then as political times changed under mikhail s gorbachev and 
history was rewritten some of the officials were disgraced and the 
circle was completed 
naberezhni chelny renamed brezhnev was returned to its 
original name tsaritsyn renamed stalingrad became volgograd 
other name changes actual or likely include the emergence of old 
samara from kuibyshev nizhny novgorod from gorky transformation 
of kirov to vzyatka sverdlovsk to old ekaterinburg andropov to 
rybinsk the rescue of marnupol from zhdanov lugansk from 
voroshilovgrad and vladikavkaz from ordzhonikidze 
some people who are fed up with the old order even want to 
change leningrad back to st petersburg 
the name of mikhail kalinin the soviet president in 19381946 
was attached to many places other than tver which became kalinin 
on his birthday in 1931 
koenigsberg a historic german city incorporated into the soviet 
union at the end of world war ii became kaliningrad major streets 
in other soviet cities including moscow honor kalinin 
he was a figurehead president hated by victims of the 
collectivization of agriculture a dark period in the countrys 
history 
millions of people were arrested and executed as enemies of 
the people during the collectivization of the 1930s including 
many from kalinins home region some of the bodies are believed to 
have been dumped into mass unmarked graves near tver 
the campaign to regain kalinins old name began in the 1960s 
but did not get far until gorbachev and glasnost came along eleven 
engineers and intellectuals founded a group called return in march 
1988 with that as its goal 
boris yershov a leader of the group and a local legislator 
said returns members were described at first as extremists 
sometimes as hooligans 
people asked how could you insult the memory of mikhail 
kalinin a leading figure in the party government and society 
yershov said 
when we said he wasnt a leading figure of the party and the 
government people just didnt believe us people were so fooled by 
the propaganda for years for decades about our leaders they 
just didnt accept our words 
support for return gradually increased yershov said and people 
began asking if kalinin is not the person hes made out to be 
why do we bear his name why such a supreme honor to a person who 
promoted stalins crimes 
more than 14000 of the citys 475000 people signed a petition 
last year demanding it be called tver again local party and 
legislative bodies eventually gave their support and the idea was 
ratified by yeltsin a radical reformer elected president of 
russia the countrys largest republic in june 
residents interviewed the day yeltsins decree was published 
said the move was welcome but they also wanted other changes 
im not in a festive mood said natalya drozdenko a woman 
in her mid30s waiting in a long line to buy chickens 
its only right to change the name and we have been struggling 
for it lending our signatures to petitions etcetera but somehow 
i understand its only symbolic and it wont affect our 
wellbeing 
alexander bartyenyev an 84yearold world war ii veteran 
strolling past the shops remembers when the city was still called 
tver and said mikhail kalinin never deserved the honor 
kalinin was treated as one of our own bartyenyev said he 
was born here and worked here but as president of the country he 
could not stop the bloodletting 
yershov said his organization now would turn its attention to 
restoring monuments churches and the old street names

infiniti the name connotes luxury distinctive ride smooth 
impressive power 
indeed the infiniti division flagship the q45 luxury sedan 
provides all that and more 
the 1990 infiniti m30 twodoor coupe the littler sibling is 
different however 
this makeover of the reardrive nissan leopard a model that 
nissan has sold in japan since the 1987 model year is a hybrid 
composed of an admirable suspension system an adequate powerplant 
and a rather nondistinctive exterior 
the result is a capable but unpretentious car that may be 
proving difficult for consumers to differentiate in the market 
even with the infiniti badge it carries 
the best part of the m30 is its handling on twisting country 
roads a unique sonar device mounted under the radiator senses the 
coming contours of the pavement plugs that data into an electronic 
brain that monitors speed body sway and other factors and quickly 
adjusts the cars suspension to give the driver maximum control 
the driver also can select from a button on the center console 
inside the car whether to drive in sport or comfort mode 
the comfort setting had a tad mushier feel than the sport 
mode but helped cushion road bumps the m30 features macpherson 
struts in the front and semitrailing suspension arms in the back 
stabilizer bars are at both front and back of the car to aid 
cornering 
the 3liter v6 is similar to the powerplant in nissans maxima 
and can deliver 162 horsepower at 5200 rpm with fourspeed 
automatic transmission it moves the 3300pound m30 from 060 mph 
in 97 seconds 
compared with the refined yet exciting 278horsepower of the 
q45 where the cars tires never screeched the m30 would pull 
aggressively as it went through the shift points during fast 
accelerations and the large tires dunlop p21560hr15 sport 
allseason radials squealed a couple times as they worked to grab 
the road 
outside the infiniti m30 looked similar to a honda and had 
minimal chrome even the infiniti logo lacked the lacy ornate 
design of the q45 badge 
still the car was well appointed leather interior power 
windows power door locks sunroof antitheft system air 
conditioning and antilock brakes are standard 
the m30 trunk was a roomy 116 cubic feet though you have to 
lift items up and over the car body 
rear seating was ok for two adults with the front seats pushed 
up a ways my knees were shoved into the netted map holders on the 
backs of the front seats when those seats were pushed back all the 
way i had to slouch if i sat in the middle of the rear seat to 
keep my head from hitting the roof and there i also had to contend 
with the reardrive hump in the middle of the rear floor 
the m30 fit and finish was good save for a small plastic cover 
that fell off the metal lever that activated the drivers power 
seat 
the bose sound system included dual radio controls one located 
on the radio at the center of the dashboard and a second set on the 
dash behind the steering wheel for an easier reach for the driver 
infiniti spokeswoman laura fox said competitors include bmws and 
mercedes autos the m30s 23500 base price compares with a 
24650 base price for the bmw 325 twodoor and a 31600 price for 
the lowestpriced mercedes 
early buyers of the m30 average 44 years of age with household 
income of 96000 fiftyseven percent were men fox said adding 
that most are married and are college educated 
to bolster overall infiniti division sales the q45 and m30 will 
be joined this fall by a new infiniti the g20 sedan which is to 
be priced under 20000 
because the m30 is a new vehicle consumer reports magazine does 
not list owner complaints

critics of the socalled big green initiative 
that californians will vote on this fall say its restrictions on 
agricultural chemicals probably would mean the end of civilization 
that is an exaggeration of course but there is alarm among 
some farm groups chemical companies and consumer watchers and 
its not just in california says an agriculture department report 
if big green is approved it would ban the use of chemicals that 
are suspected of causing cancer or birth defects 
overall some estimates indicate 70 percent of the pesticides 
now used in california would be banned within two to eight years 
shannon reid hamm of the departments economic research service 
said fruit and vegetable farmers may be left out in the cold if 
the initiative becomes law 
chemical manufacturers faced with high costs of research and 
development would be less inclined to develop new chemical 
alternatives for one state even when that state is california 
with its giant share of the fruit and vegetable market 
california is the major supplier of fruits and vegetables to 
the united states and in some cases the world she said in the 
august issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
last year she said california accounted for 85 billion or 
41 percent of the nations farm sales of fruit nuts and vegetables 
during the 1980s hamm said california had four consecutive 
years of belownormal rainfall soaring land prices and reforms in 
labor laws 
alone any one of these events would have strained local 
growers she said yet these changes may not reshape the 
industry as much as the big green initiative 
the initiative formally the california environmental 
protection act also has provisions for ozone depletion offshore 
oil drilling and oil spills and air pollution 
a coalition of local farm groups retailers and distributors 
called californians for responsible food laws or careful proposed 
a counter initiative called the consumer pesticide act of 1990 
this initiative was designed to address only those parts of big 
green dealing with food and farm worker safety hamm said if both 
initiatives pass the one with the most votes will supersede the 
provisions in the other that deal with food and worker safety 
hamm said there has been much public speculation about the 
physical and economic impact of big green but that estimates vary 
greatly 
one usda researcher has estimated that a ban on fungicides and 
insecticides on lettuce and tomatoes would cut yields 50 percent to 
60 percent and boost consumer prices 
others believe that output of several important fruits and 
vegetables would drop about 28 percent and that prices would rise 
50 percent she said 
but these estimates come from economic models and industry 
consensus rather than historical evidence hamm said 
whether big green or the careful initiative passes on nov 6 
chemical availability probably will decline in the 1990s she 
said initially fruit and vegetable growers likely will face 
higher production costs and consumers will see higher prices lower 
quality and tighter supplies as chemicals are removed from use in 
california 
the higher prices will encourage production in other states and 
foreign countries hamm said 
other countries are watching the situation and the bush 
administration is concerned that california going its own way with 
big green could have world trade repercussions 
trade representative carla hills has asked the us 
international trade commission to investigate the potential impact 
of big green on world trade an interim report is due by sept 31 
hills has said big green standards would be tougher than federal 
rules and thus create potential conflict 
also she said in her may 8 letter to the commission adoption 
of the initiative could seriously affect any new us trade 
obligations that may result from current talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the american farm bureau federation said if each state enacted 
its own pesticide regulations the lack of uniformity would 
severely hamper us agriculture production and trade 
paul drazek the federations trade specialist said the 
california measure would make the united states less competitive 
and would run counter to gatt efforts for a uniform set of 
international agricultural health standards based on scientific 
evidence 
supporters of big green such as the natural resources defense 
council contend that the initiative would have only marginal 
effect on us trade because chemicals would be phased out over a 
long period of time and that alternatives would be found

the for sale sign is hanging at j 
stewart bryan iiis newspapers but mediahungry investors 
shouldnt get excited the deal is for advertising space not the 
papers themselves 
there are plenty of enticing offers but theyre not for 
sale bryan newly installed as chairman of media general inc 
said of the companys daily newspapers here and in winstonsalem 
nc and tampa fla 
two years ago burt sugarman a californiabased television game 
show producer tried to parlay control of about 10 percent of media 
general stock into three seats on the board of directors but the 
effort failed because a twotiered stock plan gave the bryan family 
the upper hand in shareholder voting power 
sugarman eventually gave up his holdings for 44 million and a 
newsprint recycling mill valued at 56 million which he sold a 
year later for 95 million 
bryan 52 said he didnt begrudge sugarman the profit we 
think we made a good deal and were happy with it he said 
but the sugarman episode taught bryan what a waste of company 
resources it is to spend money and time to fend off raiders when 
you ought to be spending your time trying to maximize shareholder 
value he said 
these days tending to the needs of shareholders means coping 
with a sluggish advertising market 
on july 1 bryan succeeded his father d tennant bryan as 
chairman and replaced james s evans as president and chief 
executive officer 
the younger bryan a director of the associated press is the 
fourth generation of his family to run the citys newspapers his 
father now 84 succeeded bryans grandfather as publisher in 1944 
then founded media general in 1969 and steered the company to a 
tenfold increase in assets over 20 years 
during the senior bryans final quarter as chairman the company 
posted 124 million in earnings or 48 cents a share more than 
double the 61 million or 23 cents a share in the second quarter 
of 1989 
but stewart bryan said advertising a key element in newspaper 
profits is still troublesome for media generals richmond 
timesdispatch and the richmond news leader the winstonsalem 
journal and the tampa tribune 
you set goals all the time but theyre very hard to keep when 
youre in a recession in an advertising recession which is 
certainly what all media companies with very few exceptions are in 
right now bryan said times are tough 
bankruptcies and consolidations in the retail industry are a 
large part of the problem he said 
three years ago the miller amp rhoads department store chain was 
the leading advertiser in the richmond papers bryan said and 
now miller amp rhoads is no more 
the chain filed for bankruptcy late last year although some 
miller amp rhoads stores were sold to other chains its flagship 
downtown store just two blocks from media generals headquarters 
remains vacant 
media generals restructuring has meant selling much of its 
newsprint interests as well as the california papers last year 
the companys revenues fell to 606 million from 756 million in 
1988 largely because of divested assets operating profits of 65 
million in 1989 were down 34 percent from 98 million a year 
earlier 
what remains of media general in addition to the daily 
newspapers are three television stations in jacksonville and 
tampa fla and charleston sc two cable television companies 
in fairfax county and fredericksburg va a 40 percent stake in 
new jerseybased garden state newspapers a chain of weeklies plus 
a few smaller holdings 
instead of expanding we are trying to get back to the core 
businesses that have been the basis for whatever success we have 
enjoyed over the years bryan said 
bryan came up through the business working in circulation and 
editorial posts before becoming publisher of the tribune co in 
tampa he subsequently became publisher of the richmond papers and 
was named a director of media general in 1974 
he caught on real quick said tennant bryan it was time 
for me to go and time for him to take over i think he has earned 
the high regard of his colleagues and his contemporaries in the 
press 
i was never brought up to think id be running this company 
stewart bryan said i guess i began to think it might be a 
possibility in the last five years or so 
bryan father of two daughters said he has had little time 
recently for his hobbies of tennis fishing and duck hunting 
taking over the top job feels pretty much the same as before 
just a little less free time a little more mail a little more 
work to do i suppose he said this is not any radical change 
the same people are here 
bryans father stayed on as chairman of the board of directors 
executive committee and evans who had been president since 1982 
and ceo since 1985 moved to vice chairman 
we try to seek a consensus on what it is were doing or 
considering doing and i think it will remain that way bryan 
said 
industry analysts see the companys shift in management as a 
good sign 
frankly i think having a younger guy at the helm is a 
positive step for this company said peter appert a stock 
analyst with cj lawrence in new york 
the companys stock has sunk from about 42 per share in may 
1988 when sugarman made his foray to about 25 
in recent months the stock has attracted the interest of new 
york money manager mario j gabelli who has raised his stake in 
media general stock to about 17 percent gabelli did not return 
calls for comment 
bryan said he was not worried that gabellis holdings might be 
used in a power play similar to the sugarman raid his investment 
in us is really quite small when you look at it in terms of his 
total pot that hes got to invest somewhere bryan said

some magazine readers are thumbing their noses 
at scent strips the fragrance advertising inserts that can 
make everything in the mailbox smell like a perfume store 
these people want scent strips sealed in odorproof wrappers to 
protect the health of the allergic asthmatic and hypersensitive 
as well as the olfactory sensibilities of everyone else 
legislation to regulate the use of the strips is even being 
considered in some states 
manufacturers and publishers defend the strips as an 
inexpensive effective way to bring fragrances from the perfume 
counter to the kitchen counter but some have agreed to stop using 
one form of the strips 
the scent strip was first used widely in the early 1980s to 
introduce a perfume called giorgio whose manufacturers could not 
afford the usual television advertising and promotional giveaways 
women were able to sample the powerful perfume at their leisure 
and anyone else not directly upwind also got a blast giorgio 
became americas best selling fragrance 
billions of fragrance inserts have been distributed over the 
past decade and about 30 major magazines regularly carry them the 
magazines love the ad revenue 15 million last year but some 
readers dont like the scents 
one is amy solomon 38 who opened a fashion magazine last 
spring on a train ride from manhattan to albany 
by beacon she had a headache by poughkeepsie she could barely 
open her eyes by hudson she felt sick to her stomach 
there ought to be a law she told herself as director of 
communications for new york state sen martin connor she was in a 
position to help pass one 
at solomons urging connor is sponsoring a bill to prevent 
distribution of cosmetic or fragrance samples unless they are 
enclosed in a sealant such as a plastic or foil wrapper 
legislators in new jersey and massachusetts also are preparing 
bills several magazines are refusing strip ads and new york 
magazine subscribers can request a stripfree copy 
a scent strip is a coating usually containing hundreds of 
thousands of microscopic capsules of fragrance oil that has been 
slathered under the overflap of an ad page 
in theory the capsules are broken and their aroma released only 
when the overlap is peeled back in reality capsules often break 
prematurely in shipping and handling 
but the worst culprit is something called free oil 
by the late 80s thick fashion magazines had become a riot of 
competing fragrances in an attempt to grab readers by the nose 
some companies began dousing their inserts with unencapsulated 
fragrance oil that soaks into the paper whether or not the flap is 
pulled back 
such magazines mingle with other mail and even soldier of 
fortune could wind up smelling more like a boutique than a rifle 
range carolyn wright a letter carrier from ravena ny says she 
gets a headache the day cosmopolitan is delivered 
last month california barred free oil inserts 
in an attempt to head off more restrictive laws the leading 
makers of fragrance inserts agreed to stop using free oil on july 1 
although no one knows how many people are acutely sensitive to 
fragrances experts say that between 10 and 20 percent of americans 
may be sensitive to chemicals commonly used in fragrances 
michael petrina spokesman for the cosmetic toiletry and 
fragrance association says fragrances bother relatively few 
people and that their hardship is offset by the benefit to 
advertisers magazines and interested consumers 
its unclear he adds if any sealant could totally eliminate 
the possibility of exposure it would at any rate increase the 
cost of producing each strip as much as 10 times 
but sen connor says some sort of sealant as required by his 
bill affords the only reliable protection 
when a reader opens a magazine he says the only danger 
should be a paper cut

the polish capital is almost out of money 
because the nations economic reform program has left thousands of 
businesses facing bankruptcy and unable to make tax payments the 
city government reports 
large enterprises small factories craftsmen and foreignlinked 
companies all have had trouble meeting their obligations and a 
dramatic drop in revenues collected by the warsaw government has 
resulted the media reported this week 
in the province of warsaw which includes the city and 
surrounding villages local governments have paid only 3 percent of 
their annual dues to the provincial government the zycie warszawy 
newspaper said 
the local governments owe 506 million money they are unable 
to raise because they managed to collect only 40 percent of the 
taxes owed to the village administrations the newspaper said 
meanwhile the national finance ministry is demanding the 
provinces pay their contributions to the central budget the 
official pap news agency said 
all this has made it so that the warsaw province is on the 
edge of bankruptcy acting provincial governor adam langer told 
pap 
langer said a precise review of the budget would be completed 
this month but it appears some municipal projects would have to be 
halted he said the province needs 15 million to complete 
municipal investments this year 
the shock reform program initiated jan 1 nationwide is designed 
to turn polands weak centralized economy into a marketdriven 
capitalist system the massive national budget subsidies provided 
to enterprises have been cut off forcing businesses to become 
selfsufficient or face bankruptcy meanwhile prices for goods 
have risen dramatically requiring companies to buy supplies at

if higher oil prices hold the effect is expected to spread 
beyond gasoline to utility bills home mortgages foodstuffs 
fertilizer automobile tires and a myriad of other goods 
the first victims in line will be utilities and transportation 
industries said economist david wyss of drimcgrawhill inc in 
lexington mass you can expect your electic bills going up 
wyss said inflation via high oil prices gradually dribbles 
down to almost everything in the economy 
the american automobile association reported tuesday that 
gasoline prices at the pump hit nearly fiveyear highs as 
selfservice unleaded rose 15 cents overnight to 1201 per 
gallon the highest price since the last week of 1985 
in its sruvey of 1400 stations nationwide the aaa said 
unleaded fuel increased 126 cents since last wednesday the day 
before iraqs takeover of kuwait sent the price of crude oil 
skyrocketing on world markets 
spot checks showed gasoline prices up as much as 25 cents in the 
week at some michigan service stations among the biggest weekly 
increases since the 1973 arab oil embargo 
spokespeople for various industries that rely on oil for 
transportation or production said rising fuel prices all add to 
costs that would have to be passed onto consumers eventually 
if it turns into a longterm permanent increase it will have 
an effect on all costs associated with fuel prices said michael 
rourke spokesman for the aampp supermarket chain which operates 
1231 stores in 26 eastern states and canada 
frozen food express industries inc in dallas which hauls 
perishable products nationwide is one of several companies that 
has asked the government to approve a surcharge on regular shipping 
rates because of the oil price rise 
chairman stoney m stubbs jr whose company has 1000 
refrigeration trucks said up to 20 percent of costs are related to 
fuel 
a 15 cents a gallon increase eats your profit up said 
charles lambright an independent trucker in jacksonville texas 
the only way we can stay in business is with a surcharge 
surcharges are passed on to the food companies or other users 
and economists predict those increased costs gradually will show up 
on supermarket shelves by october 
oil is a major component of the raw materials used to make 
tires if oil prices continue at higher levels prices will have 
to reflect these higher raw material costs a goodyear tire amp 
rubber co spokesman said 
dow chemical co faces 600 million in additional energy 
spending annually if the price of oil rises 3 a barrel said 
leonard bogner a prudentialbache securities inc analyst 
petroleumbased raw material cost increases at comapnies such as 
dow could directly affect prices of plastics fertilizer and other 
products 
utilities that burn large amounts of oil pass changes in fuel 
costs directly to customers when the fuel is used one benefit 
utilities use more natural gas in the summer which could help 
forestall bill increases 
boston edison co said customers will pay more for electricity 
if oil prices remain high after the utilitys 30 to 45day supply 
of oil runs out the utility generates about a third of its power 
from oil in the summer and about twothirds in the winter 
cameron h daley senior vice president in charge of power 
production said boston edisons most recent oil purchase was at 
15 a barrel if prices hold at 30 a barrel the average customer 
faces a 6 to 10 monthly increase 
when i start burning that more expensive oil they start seeing 
the increase in the bill daley said 
consolidated edison co of new york said the price of 
lowsulphur residual oil it burns rose to 23 a barrel monday from 
18 a week earlier and the added costs will be passed on to 
consumers spokeswoman rosalie zuckerman said the utility has a 
roughly sixweek stock of oil purchased at lower prices 
home mortgage interest rates have risen as much as a half of a 
percentage point in recent days to above 10 percent following 
treasury bond yields upward in reaction to fears that higher oil 
prices would trigger inflation 
right now there is a general pickup in daily applications as 
people look in to lock in interest rates and protect themselves 
from subsequent increases said countrywides chief financial 
officer stanford kurland

it might seem strange that anheuserbusch inc 
executives are pleased with only flat sales this year from their 
workhorse brand budweiser but they are 
after growing phenomenally in the 1980s while other premium 
brands sagged sales of the king of beers fell slightly last year 
according to industry estimates it was the first sales decline 
since 1976 
this year expected to be the industrys best since 1986 
budweiser is showing no growth according to company figures 
meanwhile one of its leading competitors miller genuine draft 
which has only been around since 1986 is growing at a rapid pace 
and became one of the 10 topselling beers last year 
patrick stokes who just took over as president of 
anheuserbusch inc admits the brand is not growing as much as it 
has in the past but hes not worried about speculation by industry 
watchers who say the king may be in trouble 
i think that people who are speculating about budweiser would 
be right on target if it were down 5 percent but its not 
stokes said in a recent interview budweiser even or up or down 
1 percent is fine 
such growth is a new strategy for the st louisbased beermaker 
which sells 42 percent of the beer in the united states and is 
pushing over the next few years to reach a 50 percent market share 
and its not surprising that budweiser which accounts for one 
out of every four beer sales in the country is being excluded from 
the companys growth strategy 
in todays beer industry the future seems to be in light beers 
and other specialized niches the nations second third and 
fourthmost popular beers are light beers two of them bud light 
and coors light are among the fastest growing 
the premiumbeer segment beers such as budweiser miller high 
life and coors slipped 20 percent from 1980 to 1989 while overall 
beers sales remained fairly stagnant 
theyve anheuserbusch realized that you cant have one beer 
thats going to appeal to a megasegment of the society said bob 
bernstein a stock analyst for edward d jones co in st louis 
there are more specialized tastes out there and the company is 
going after them 
theres even a question as to whether miller genuine draft is a 
niche beer rather than a premium beer 
but if budweiser isnt being counted on for growth and premium 
beers are on the way out then what does the future hold for the 
brand which has been around since 1876 
our job is to have budweiser as a stable brand within our 
system and have the other brands contributing to give us a net 
positive said stokes 47 
stokes took over the brewery job from his boss august busch 
iii the chairman and chief executive officer of anheuserbusch 
cos inc the company owns the brewery the st louis cardinals 
baseball team and several other subsidiaries 
the question is can they do that and not let their very 
original brand budweiser get clobbered too much said joseph 
doyle a stock analyst with smith barney in new york 
in an unusual move and in an effort to prove that the countrys 
most popular beer is not getting clobbered stokes has decided to 
disclose some usually private brewery sales figures 
according to the company budweiser sales to retailers for 1990 
through july are exactly the same as last year for just july the 
brand was up 83 percent 
the company is very happy with flat sales for budweiser heres 
why 
the brewery introduced its popular bud dry earlier this year and 
that brand has been eating into budweiser sales stokes estimates 
that for every two bud dry beers that are sold one budweiser sale 
is lost 
thats a rate that we could live with forever stokes said 
meanwhile another member of the budweiser family bud light 
continues to grow and take some sales away from budweiser bud 
light was up 94 percent from last year in adjusted sales to 
retailers through july to anheuserbusch executives and industry 
analysts thats an outstanding number 
the whole budweiser family is selling 59 percent more beer to 
retailers than last year and the overall brewery is up 67 percent 
that increase comes in a year when industry analysts are predicting 
only 2 percent growth 
those are rather fabulous numbers id say theyre awesome 
said jerry steinman president and publisher of beer marketers 
insights an industry newsletter i knew they were having a good 
year but i didnt know it was this good 
the significance of the sales to retailers numbers is that 
they are the best gauge of how much beer is actually being sold 
they usually are wellguarded secrets 
normally the nations beermakers release sales to 
wholesalers figures that are not as illuminating 
anheuserbuschs job for the 90s stokes said is to manage the 
portfolio of beers it has introduced twenty years ago the company 
only sold three brands of beer budweiser michelob and busch 
today it sells 17 brands including four introduced this year 
so far the companys family approach to beer marketing 
seems to be paying off two weeks ago anheuserbusch announced 
record profits and sales for the second quarter and the first half 
of the year primarily because of the success of its brewery

iraqs invasion of kuwait is driving up oil 
prices and causing some smiles on the faces of those who have 
struggled through the ragged recovery of the us oil industry 
in americas energy capital of houston a city still in the 
final recovery stages of the last oil bust there are whispers of 
another boom 
the oil and gas business has been down for quite a while and 
so we need a little good news but i hate for it to come as a 
result of a war said john faulkinberry chief financial officer 
of paramount petroleum co an independent oil and gas exploration 
and production company 
the oil industry has been inching toward a renewed vigor for 
some time anticipating higher oil prices in the coming years 
companies began last year to increase their exploration budgets 
and new drilling and exploration techniques have sparked regional 
booms in the oil patch 
but with the cutoff of oil from iraq and kuwait and worries 
about the rest of the persian gulf the stumbling recovery could 
hit full stride 
a sustained increase in oil prices could fuel domestic drilling 
activity raise revenues and attract investors who were scared away 
when prices plunged in the mid1980s some observers said 
there is an air of expectancy faulkinberry said this one 
event could really heat things up it could drive up domestic 
drilling activity and bring capital back into the industry 
this probably means the business is really going to jump into 
second gear now he added i think a lot of oil exploration 
companies will be more aggressive in their businesses 
the number of rigs actively exploring for oil and gas rose to 
4500 at the height of the boom in december 1981 but it plunged to 
a low of 663 after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
this week the count totaled 966 down 30 from the previous 
week but up from the 874 working rigs a year ago according to 
houstonbased baker hughes inc which keeps track of the count 
if prices remain at the current levels id say youd have a 
significant impact on drilling activity ike kerridge a vice 
president at baker hughes said you could start seeing that in a 
few weeks 
others however are remaining cautious about the possible 
impact of the present turmoil in the middle east they still 
remember the devastating effect that plunging oil prices had on the 
entire energy industry 
there are still too many of us who have memories of the 
previous boom said don covey president of the exploration and 
production division of mitchell energy amp development corp an 
independent oil company based in the woodlands north of houston 
people are going to be moving slowly because of the 
uncertainty and because we have seen what has happened before 
covey said 
oil prices soared towards 40 per barrel in 1981 but by 1986 
had fallen below 10 per barrel 
the decline undercut the financial and real estate industries in 
texas while the rest of the country enjoyed cheap gas 
regardless of the progress thats been made the state is oil 
and gas driven houston in particular faulkinberry said 
anytime you have an event like this happen that makes oil prices 
go up its going to have an impact on houston 
oil prices increased since iraqs invasion and already have been 
passed along at the pumps 
in his address to the nation today president bush said he asked 
oil companies to show restraint and not abuse todays 
uncertainties to raise prices bush also said he will ask other 
oilproducing nations to replace embargoed iraqi and kuwait oil 
oil prices fell today in what traders said reflected confidence 
that there would be enough world oil production to make up for 
supplies lost in the wake of iraqs invasion 
on the new york mercantile exchange the cost of benchmark west 
texas intermediate was off 81 cents at 2750 a barrel at 
midmorning the contract had risen 26 cents in volatile trading 
tuesday to settle at its highest level since dec 6 1985 
oil prices also sank in london the spot price of brent blend 
the most widely traded international crude oil fell 190 to 
2550 a barrel

american airlines said today it will 
increase its fares by 10 percent because of what it called the 
skyrocketing cost of fuel brought about by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
michael w gunn the airlines senior vice president for 
marketing said the increase will go into effect friday for flights 
in the continental united states hawaii and the caribbean and on 
aug 15 for international flights 
in recent days pan american world airways and northwest 
airlines said they would raise their fares because of soaring fuel 
costs 
we regret the recent events in the middle east have caused an 
increase in the costs of fuel leading to an increase in our fare 
price american airlines wants to be fair and we are especially 
sorry to do this because higher fares will create hardships 
gunn said 
airlines feel the impact of fuel increases almost immediately 
thus we must move rapidly to recover this cost since many seats 
have already been sold at prices that dont reflect the fuel 
increase gunn said 
even with the higher fares we expect to recover only a 
portion of the increased fuel costs since we have already sold 
half of our seats for the next two months at old prices american 
airlines spokesman tim smith said 
the higher fares apply only to tickets that are bought after the 
increase goes into effect smith said 
fuel costs make up 15 percent of american airlines total 
budget but at the higher prices we estimate it will be at least 
20 percent smith said 
on july 1 american airlines was paying an average of 57 cents 
per gallon for its fuel smith said 
by today the system average had risen to 68 cents but the 
spot market is already at 85 cents and the spot is what our market 
is based upon smith added 
american airlines uses 24 billion gallons of fuel a year the 
increased cost of fuel at this point means the carriers annual 
cost of 16 billion would soar to 23 billion an increase of 
about 720 million smith said

president bush said today that the middle east 
crisis and the resulting increases in oil prices have not reduced 
the necessity for a significant deficitreduction agreement 
i still think its absolutely essential to get a budget 
agreement with congress and thats going to require a lot of 
principle bush told a news conference 
congressional leaders and the administration have made little 
progress in devising a deficitreduction plan agreeing only to 
resume efforts next month 
bush implied that he soon will resume public criticism of 
democrats negotiating posture i dont feel bound by an 
agreement that ive told the congressional leaders is no longer in 
effect he said apparently referring to an earlier concession to 
tone down political rhetoric about the negotiations 
congressional republicans are unhappy that democrats have 
refused to put forth a specific proposal even after bush backed 
away from a campaign pledge to oppose tax increases 
senate republican leader bob dole told reporters today the 
administration is still seeking a 500 billion fiveyear 
deficitreduction plan he added however that there is little 
chance of raising gasoline taxes as part of that plan and 
questioned how deeply defense spending could be cut in light of 
us military involvement in saudi arabia 
key members of congress say they see no reason to ease up on 
efforts to reach an agreement 
if the economy begins to look really bad every element of the 
deficitreduction package will be threatened rep bill frenzel 
rminn ranking republican on the house budget committee said 
tuesday right now the major effect is to make an energy tax 
less likely 
a military faceoff with iraq also could fuel arguments that 
slashing the 300 billion defense budget is a bad idea right now 
its living proof there are mean people in the world and we need 
a respectable national defense said sen phil gramm rtexas 
however senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
said the proposed 10 billion to 15 billion in military cuts 
really arent that deep in the first place 
petroleum prices have jumped several dollars closer to 30 per 
barrel since iraq invaded oilrich kuwait last week fuel costs in 
the united states are already rising along with prices for other 
goods and services such as airline tickets and electricity 
bargainers concede that with fuel prices rising raising taxes 
on gasoline or other sources of energy becomes less palatable 
i think it probably will kill any effort to have a broadbased 
energy tax gramm said 
congressional leaders and bush administration officials have 
struggled inconclusively since may to forge a package of tax 
increases and spending cuts totaling 50 billion for next year and 
500 billion over five years the summit talks are on hold for 
congress august recess 
iraqs takeover of kuwait and resulting military and economic 
moves by the united states and its allies means the american 
economy could be weaker when the bargainers reconvene in september 
negotiators said they would watch economic performance closely 
anybody who thinks were not being forced into a reevaluation 
these next few weeks is kidding themselves said house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
if the economy seems shaky one option would be to lower the 
amount of taxes and spending cuts slated for fiscal 1991 which 
starts oct 1 
under any circumstances we need to focus on significant 
deficit reduction over five years said panetta 
but budget bargainers said no reasons have yet surfaced to shoot 
for a less ambitious deficitcutting package 
i dont think we can see clearly enough into the future to 
know how much well be affected said frenzel i think the 
summiteers ought to go forward with the plan weve been 
discussing

the dollar rose slightly wednesday in dealings in 
europe supported by worries about rising tensions in the persian 
gulf 
gold traded in a narrow range 
european dealers said the possiblity of a conflict with iraq 
outweighed fundamental concerns about weakness in the us economy 
that could drive interest rates lower and make the dollar less 
appealing to foreign investors 
theres only one reason for the firmer dollar and thats the 
general situation in the middle east said werner esch a trader 
at bethmann bank in frankfurt something is going to have to 
happen here either iraq will yield and withdraw from kuwait or the 
americans are going to march in 
bauer said as long as the situation remains unclear the dollar 
will continue to gain support once matters are more settled he 
said the chances are that the dollar will resume its downward 
drift 
some currency dealers in europe debated whether the dollar was 
the safest currency to hold but they generally agree that growing 
tensions in the gulf will help mute any aggressive attempts to take 
the dollar lower for now

the nations economy will not be able to avoid 
a recession later this year even if the explosive middle east 
situation eases soon the us chamber of commerce said wednesday 
we anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual 
standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually 
contract by 14 percent in the fourth quarter said richard w 
rahn chamber vice president and chief economist 
our forecast shows the economy continuing to experience 
negative real growth in the first quarter of 1991 and practically 
no growth in the second quarter he told a news conference 
rahn said the impending recession is due to misguided economic 
policy and not middle east developments although iraqi 
adventurism in the middle east is exacerbating this countrys 
economic weakness 
even without the mideast impact a recession is unavoidable 
rahn said 
although the bush administration and congress must share the 
blame for a recession the federal reserve is most responsible he 
said 
for over two years the fed has labored under the mistaken 
fear that economic growth causes inflation and has pursued a credit 
policy designed to slow real economic growth rahn contended 
it is time for the fed congress and the administration to adopt 
progrowth economic policies 
with correct policy choices the economy will begin to 
rebound during the third quarter of next year he added 
rahn called on the fed as he has repeatedly to rescind its 
highinterest rate policy and allow markets to set the levels at 
the same time he said the fed should open its policymaking 
process to the public 
it is unconscionable that unelected central bankers are 
permitted to determine the nations economic fate in secrecy 
without any form of public accountability he said 
rahn also called on the administration and congress to cease 
efforts to create a fiveyear budget deficit reduction package that 
includes tax increases 
instead he said budget negotiators should adopt progrowth 
tax cuts including a lowering of the capital gains rate and 
reduction of the social security payroll tax

atlantic richfield co today froze wholesale 
fuel prices for one week becoming the first us oil company to 
heed a request by president bush to control prices during the 
middle east crisis 
arco based in los angeles said prices of gasoline diesel and 
jet fuel would remain at todays level 
we hope the market will stabilize during this time but if at 
the end the week our position is out of line with world market 
prices we will have to recognize that fact george babikian 
president arco products co the companys refining and marketing 
division said in a statement 
we will not raise our prices even then unless we are 
substantially below the general market he said otherwise if 
we remain below the market we risk a run on our stations which 
could drain our supply and create a panic buying situation in the 
marketplace 
arco said it was encouraging its dealers who by federal law set 
their own prices not to increase pump prices the company also 
called for the driving public to begin conserving fuel in support 
of the presidents effort to lead the country through this crisis 
in a televised address on the middle east situation earlier 
today bush called for oil companies to do their fair share in 
holding down gasoline prices which have risen about 13 cents a 
gallon at the pump in the last week an arco spokesman said the 
company had raised wholesale prices by only 4 cents a gallon since 
iraq took over kuwait last week while the spot market for gasoline 
had jumped 20 cents 
arco receives most of its crude oil from alaska and not the 
middle east but the spokesman said the cost of its crude oil still 
reflects world market prices 
company officials acknowledged that it could lose money through 
the price freeze but said they wanted to comply with bushs 
request 
other oil companies today said they supported bushs call for 
restraint but blamed market forces for rising prices and said they 
had behaved fairly in raising prices

adams an unsuccessful democratic gubernatorial candidate this 
year was named late tuesday in a 14count indictment alleging 
misapplications of 1211 million in sampl funds so were three other 
exlamar officers and two borrowers 
the indictment accused adams and the others of trying to hide 
lamar savings poor financial condition from the federal home loan 
bank board and of arranging sham loans to fund purchases of 
repossessed real estate from the troubled thrifts portfolio 
the blame for this tragedy should be laid where it belongs 
at the doorstep of the reagan administration which deregulated 
sampls adams said in a written statement these indictments 
against me are part of what has become a political issue and little 
more 
in washington attorney general richard thornburgh called lamar 
one of the most notorious failures in the southwest and among the 
top 100 sampl fraud cases being investigated 
adams lawyer henry novak contended the former thrift 
executive is the victim of a double standard under which the 
government allowed certain sampl business practices in the early 
1980s but now calls them fraud 
novak said lamars transactions were legitimate but prosecutors 
now are applying new theories of criminality to what once was 
standard sampl practice he said 
it was business as usual in the savings and loan industry in 
1983 84 and 85 but now bush administration since the entire 
industry has collapsed what youre doing is taking the position 
that that was fraud that that was wrongdoing novak said 
novak who is defending adams in a 100 million civil suit filed 
by the federal deposit insurance corp said government regulators 
long were out to get adams because he was an innovative maverick in 
a staid business 
stanley adams had been the target for quite some time of bad 
feelings on the part of the regulators he was an innovator he was 
different he was a maverick in an industry in which conformity was 
a very important thing novak said 
adams was principal owner of lamar savings from 1973 to december 
1985 government regulators shut it down in may 1988 it was the 
biggest thrift failure in central texas and officials have 
estimated the cost to the government at 1 billion 
the colorful adams 56 unsuccessfully ran for governor in this 
years primary when filing for the democratic nomination he 
listed his occupation as alleged whitecollar racketeer 
several years ago lamar applied to federal regulators to open a 
branch office on the moon naming a crater where the national 
aeronautics and space administration proposed to build a space 
station no action ever was taken 
at a news conference wednesday publicist garry entress released 
adams statement and one from a second defendant former lamar 
senior vice president reuben coleman who said he was innocent and 
also protested what he called political interference 
the current climate in washington what i would describe as a 
feeding frenzy of vindictiveness played a role in this action 
coleman said

architect stephen chiang always wanted a home in bustling 
midtown manhattan but skyrocketing real estate prices during the 
freespending 80s relegated him to the life of a new jersey 
commuter 
with the bang of an auctioneers gavel chiang 30 finally got 
his wish a luxury studio apartment in a prime new york spot for 
129000 nearly a third off the asking price 
dozens of other successful bidders snapped up about 9 million 
worth of what they considered bargain condominiums during a recent 
auction in turn the cashstrapped developer quickly disposed of 
hardtosell property 
once the dismal realm of bank foreclosures bankrupt farmers and 
estate liquidations auctions have become an increasingly popular 
way to peddle property in todays sluggish market even individual 
homeowners frustrated by a dearth of buyers have resorted to the 
auction alternative 
the auction marketing industry is no longer a last resort 
said jim gall president of auction co of america in miami which 
expects to auction a record 100 million in residential property 
this year its not a giveaway process its a way to bring the 
top dollar 
were seeing it in distressed areas but also where the 
markets are reasonably strong 
stephen martin president of the gwent group a real estate 
consulting firm in bloomington ind estimates the volume of all 
real estate sold through auction jumped to 265 billion last year 
from 10 billion in 1980 he predicts overall volume will rise by 
at least 10 percent in 1990 
auctions offer sellers the prime advantage of speed while 
giving buyers the chance for a bargain 
developers of the manhattan complex where chiang got his condo 
probably are saving at least 1 million in annual carrying 
costs since it might have taken them as long as three years to 
sell their remaining 55 vacant units under current market 
conditions said michael fine senior coordinator for sheldon good 
amp co of chicago the auctioneer 
fine said the apartments sold for an average 32 percent off the 
asking price 
in nearby queens ny developer tim naples said he expects to 
pay off most of his debts on a 207unit townhouse project after 
auctioning the last 68 units this past spring the carrying costs 
which include mortgage payments and utilities had amounted to 
about 150000 a month 
we couldnt have gone on much longer naples said im 
sure the banks would have taken over the place and done their own 
auction or sold it to some investor at a lower price 
auctioneers say they can offer the same help to individuals 
trying to sell their homes a growing number are feeling squeezed 
by the worst market for housing since the 198182 recession 
an auction is ideal for people who are caught between two 
houses and cant afford to wait a year to sell one of them 
said steven l good sheldon goods president 
auctions also can work in strong markets by helping bring the 
best price when competition among buyers is brisk good said 
about 20 percent of sheldon goods 250 million in residential 
auction sales last year were from individual homes and good 
expects that to rise to 30 percent of an anticipated 350 million 
in sales this year 
many real estate experts are predicting that by the end of the 
decade individual homeowners will be using auctions just as 
frequently as developers do now 
theyve long been an accepted practice overseas in australia 
where people attend auctions the way americans go to garage sales 
at least a third of all home sales are sold by the gavel 
we dont believe its an end all good said conventional 
brokers are here to stay but in a number of situations auctions 
are preferable and the broker community has acknowledged that 
the national associaton of realtors once resisted selling homes 
though auction considering it a direct threat to the property 
brokerage profession but the group has begun to embrace the 
practice last november it set up a special committee to advise 
members how to work with auctioneers 
all this comes as the government prepares to auction billions of 
dollars in real estate from insolvent savings and loan 
institutions a potential windfall to the auctioneering industry 
its not competition its more cooperation norman d 
flynn president of the national association of realtors said of 
the auctioneering business it fits closely into what were 
doing 
he said brokers can act as consultants to auctioneers by pricing 
or inspecting a home within a familiar marketplace or they can 
represent prospective buyers by inspecting a property or even 
bidding on their behalf 
auctions are conducted two ways in an absolute auction 
property goes to the highest bidder regardless of price in a 
reservebasis auction a minimum acceptable price is set or the 
seller can be granted 48 hours to decide whether to accept or 
reject the highest bid 
sellers prefer the reservebasis method while buyers prefer 
absolute sales in cases where a large number of units are 
auctioned auctioneers usually recommend sellers set aside a few 
for absolute sale as a way of drawing buyer interest and sell the 
rest the reserve way 
regardless there are potential pitfalls for sellers and buyers 
for one thing selling property by auction is more expensive 
than using a traditional broker the auctioneer takes the regions 
prevailing brokers fee from 4 percent to 10 percent of the sale 
price plus often charges for advertising the property or renting 
an auction hall that can cost as much as 5 percent more and is 
payable regardless whether the property sells 
buyers could lose money too immediately after a bid is 
accepted theyre required to sign a sales contract so in most 
cases theres no turning back 
unlike offers to buy a house through a broker auction sales 
agreements arent subject to a successful bidders ability to 
obtain a mortgage some buyers have lost their deposits because 
they couldnt follow through with a purchase auctioneers say 
also in cases of multipleunit auctions buyers may not always 
get their first choice 
the ones apartments i wanted bidded out in the very 
beginning said architect chiang i still got a good bargain a 
few years ago real estate was unreasonable in manhattan its 
getting reasonable now i hope its going to rebound right now 
walter carr a charleston sc real estate agent who recently 
picked up a couple of twobedroom apartments via auction in his 
hometowns posh historic district says he already has seen a 
rebound 
not only did he buy the units for around 50 percent below the 
asking price but has resold one for a profit exceeding 50000 
douglas clemens president of louis traiman real estate auction 
co of philadelphia said auctions can be seen as a way of 
validating the price of real estate similiar to the workings of 
the financial markets 
the auctions will produce the markets he said they 
property are like a commodity 
nonetheless its difficult for many people to think of their 
homes in that way especially if they bought when prices were at a 
peak and have watched helplessly as prices have declined in recent 
years auctioneers admit 
individual sellers are too emotional said joel zegart 
president and founder jbs amp associates inc in chicago a lot of 
people bought a year or two ago and dont have the equity yet they 
may have thought their property will go up 10 percent every year 
its like a game of musical chairs the music has finally 
stopped

the stock market made a comeback today as 
investors snapped up issues that had been pushed to attractively 
low prices during wall streets recent weak spell 
a retreat in oil prices and strength in the bond market this 
morning contributed to an improved attitude toward stocks

diffused without prolonged difficulty also helped restore investor 
confidence and encouraged renewed buying 
a lot of stocks looked like real bargains said hugh 
johnson investment strategist at first albany corp there were 
plenty of stocks that were either dirt cheap or at a minium 
undervalued 
but some buying enthusiasm was subdued by concerns that the 
financial markets remain vulnerable to shocks from developments in 
the middle east

related stocks the contract for september delivery of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil pulled back by 
235 to 2596 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange

the dollar ended higher wednesday against all 
major currencies except the japanese yen and canadian dollar 
boosted by the rising tensions in the middle east 
gold prices declined following a mixed performance overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 38320 a troy ounce down 130 from tuesday 
republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for gold at 
38270 an ounce off 280 
currency dealers said the dollar started out sharply higher 
then fell back on technical factors 
president bush said wednesday that us warplanes and combat 
troops backed by an armada of navy ships took up defensive 
positions in saudi arabia to protect that country against a 
possible invasion by iraq 
the announcement seemed to calm the financial markets 
nonetheless the possiblity of a conflict with iraq pushed the 
dollar higher dealers said those concerns they said outweighed 
any fundamental worries about economic weakness that could drive 
interest rates lower and make the dollar less appealing to foreign 
investors 
on fears of the middle east the dollar was way up said 
robert ryan corporate foreign exchange manager for the bank of new 
york 
some dealers in europe though debated whether the dollar was 
the safest currency to hold right now 
in fact after iraq invaded neighboring kuwait last week which 
touched off the mideast tensions currency dealers flocked to the 
german mark the dollar had declined on worries that a rapid rise 
in oil prices eventually would push interest rates lower 
in tokyo where the global trading day begins the dollar fell 
to a closing 15000 japanese yen from 15060 yen tuesday it traded 
at 15015 yen in london and at 14990 yen in new york down from 
15090 
the dollar was stronger against the british pound compared to 
tuesday sterling traded at 18660 in london down from 18765

oil prices sank and stocks rose wednesday as the markets 
assessed prospects that many oilproducing nations could step into 
the breach and pump plenty of crude to prevent shortages from 
further iraqi militance in the persian gulf 
on the new york mercantile exchange the cost of key west texas 
intermediate crude for september delivery plummeted 235 to settle 
at 2596 a barrel the contract had risen 26 cents in volatile 
trading tuesday to close at its highest level since dec 6 1985 
according to mercantile exchange records 
prices for petroleum products also declined sharply the 
nearterm contract for unleaded gasoline plunged 618 cents to 
settle at 7621 cents a gallon while home heating oil finished at 
7013 cents a gallon off 501 cents other contract months 
declined by lesser amounts 
stock prices gained ground around the world as traders searched 
for bargains and expressed relief that events in the persian gulf 
appeared to show signs of stabilizing despite the virtual shutoff 
of oil from iraq and its occupied neighbor kuwait 
its not as volatile a situation as it was perceived to be 
and investors are a little more confident of taking a position 
said james schroeder an analyst at chicagobased mms international 
the dow jones industrial average which slipped 570 points on 
tuesday for its sixth straight loss gained 2426 points to close 
at 273490 
clearly the dominant factor in the market was the alleged 
commitment by the saudis that they are going to increase oil 
production said bob baker senior energy analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
experts said iraq and kuwait together produced about 4 million 
barrels of crude daily but increased saudi production could cover 
about 50 percent of that 
a number of other oil producers including venezuela mexico 
iran and nigeria also indicated they could up production 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez for example was reported 
to have offered to sell the united states an additional 500000 
barrels of oil a day 
but there remained no clear indication that oil producers 
actually had begun pumping extra crude in fact opec president and 
algerian oil minister sadek boussena said individual 
initiatives by opec members should be avoided 
he said fears of supply disruptions were the result of 
psychological and speculative factors rather than real market 
fundamentals analysts interpreted boussenas statement as a call 
for the west to draw down its petroleum stocks before opec would 
move to fill any supply gaps 
there was a growing perception that oil reserves are plentiful 
president bush also sought to allay fears of an oil shortage by 
saying wednesday that he was considering dipping into the nations 
strategic reserves to bolster supplies in the face of an absence of 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil exports 
traders in the oil pits were anticipating an escalation of 
hostilities but nothing unexpected surfaced a statement out of 
baghdad declared kuwait part of iraq but stopped short of saying 
iraq had annexed the tiny emirate following last weeks lightning 
raid led by iraqi president saddam hussein 
the statment came less than two hours after president bush told 
the nation that us troops were taking up defensive positions 
in oilrich saudi arabia to guard against a possible attack by iraq 
in london the spot price of brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil fell to 2540 a barrel from 2740 late 
tuesday 
stock prices rose on major foreign markets in tokyo the nikkei 
index of 225 shares recouped 85607 points or 310 percent ending 
the day at 2850914 traders said the rebound reflected stability 
in bond and currency markets 
the nikkei lost 94646 on tuesday and had dropped 318492 
points since thursday when iraq invaded kuwait 
prices got off to a bumpy start in europe but managed to close 
higher on the london stock exchange the financial timesstock 
exchange 100share index was up 17 points or 008 percent at 
22375 at the close after seesawing throughout most of the session 
in other financial markets bond prices narrowly mixed the 
treasurys auction of 105 billion in 10year notes went off worse 
than expected and depressed the credit markets 
in the currency markets the dollar was down against the

atlantic richfield co on wednesday froze 
wholesale fuel prices for one week the first oil company to 
respond to president bushs call for restraint during the middle 
east crisis 
other big oil companies said they already are practicing 
restraint and denied widespread allegations they have been using 
instability in the persian gulf as an excuse to gouge consumers at 
the gas pump 
exxon corp said it would continue pricing its products in a 
responsible manner that reflects overall market supply 
conditions the worlds largest oil company said it buys 27 
million barrels of oil daily and must compete on world markets 
and pay world market prices 
arco the eighthlargest us oil company said its freeze 
affects prices of gasoline diesel and jet fuel arco also said it 
was encouraging its dealers who by federal law set their own pump 
prices to avoid increases 
bush earlier wednesday asked oil companies to do their fair 
share in holding down gas prices which have risen more than 16 
cents a gallon at the pump since iraq invaded kuwait last thursday 
we hope the market will stabilize during this time but if at 
the end the week our position is out of line with world market 
prices we will have to recognize that fact george babikian 
president of arco products co the companys refining and 
marketing division said in a statement 
we will not raise our prices even then unless we are 
substantially below the general market he said otherwise if 
we remain below the market we risk a run on our stations which 
could drain our supply and create a panic buying situation in the 
marketplace 
arco operates 1700 stations in arizona california nevada 
oregon and washington arco gets most of its crude from alaska but 
the cost of its oil still reflects world market prices 
the american automobile association said wednesday the price of 
selfservice regular unleaded gasoline rose an average 36 cents a 
gallon nationwide overnight to 1237 a gallon for a rise of 162 
cents since aug 1 
other oil companies said they supported bushs call for 
restraint but blamed market forces for rising prices and said they 
had behaved fairly 
while we have raised prices to date we have recovered only a 
fraction of the higher costs incurred mobil corp chairman allen 
e murray said in a letter to bush 
mobil also planned advertisements headlined wheres the 
ripoff stating its position on the editorial pages of 
thursdays new york times and later this week in several other 
publications 
restraint has been a longstanding policy at texaco that 
company said we have been doing so and we fully intend to 
continue exercising restraint in gasoline prices 
executives said crude oil prices had increased much faster than 
gas prices in the last month some attacked recent allegations of 
price gouging by politicians and consumer groups as opportunistic 
and unfair 
already bruised by bad public relations after the exxon valdez 
oil spill oil companies also had to contend with revived memories 
of profiteering allegations that followed the 1973 arab oil embargo 
oil companies frequently have been criticized since gasoline 
prices soared from about 39 cents a gallon in 1973 to 53 cents a 
year later following the arab oil embargo prices climbed to nearly 
69 cents by 1978 before surging above 1 when iranian supplies 
were cut off by its 1979 revolution deposing the regime of us 
ally the shah 
more recently the industry came under attack when prices jumped 
after the exxon valdez spill off the alaska coast last year and 
heating oil skyrocketed during a december freeze despite 
allegations no profiteering or collusion by companies was proven 
the sun co is not recovering its costs at the present time 
robert mcclements chairman and chief executive of the 
philadelphiabased oil company said in an interview 
unfortunately we are in an election year and there is a 
temptation on the part of many of those in the political arena who 
in the desire for public exposure thrash out one more time at the 
oil industry he said 
amoco oil co said the price it charges gasoline dealers has 
increased about 10 cents a gallon in the last week compared with 
20 cents on spot oil markets for immediately fuel delivery 
but the chicago company said the market system of supply and 
demand and open competition in petroleum pricing can allow for 
rapid price increases 
supply disruptions at a major company like amoco could be far 
worse for consumers than temporary higher prices it said the 
consumer is better served by a market system that reacts and 
distributes products efficiently 
several executives said even though it can take up to 90 days 
for crude oil to reach the united states from the middle east 
companies usually pay the market price in effect when it arrives at 
the refinery not the price when it was contracted for 
they said about 50 percent of crude oil in the united states is 
produced from domestic sources where delivery time is much 
shorter also large amounts of gasoline are purchased on often 
volatile spot markets finally as with other commodities 
market prices can rise immediately as companies seek to cover 
future replacement costs

the jail neil bush posters have sprouted 
around town making their way from the bohemian side streets of 
dupont circle to the broad avenues of the capitals downtown 
the third son of george and barbara bush has become literally 
the poster boy of the nations savings and loan scandal his 
patrician face plastered on lamp posts in a parody of an fbi 
wanted handbill his family name which catapulted him into the 
altitudes of wealth and power in denver five years ago now has 
thrown him into the vortex of public controversy 
in august 1985 with scant banking experience behind him neil 
bush joined the board of directors of silverado banking savings 
and loan association a denver thrift that went bust three years 
later at a cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
now bush stands accused by thrift regulators of conflict of 
interest for not disclosing business links to big silverado 
borrowers he denies any wrongdoing he also could be a target of 
a negligence lawsuit that the federal deposit insurance corp is 
considering filing against him and other silverado directors 
federal investigators are looking into thousands of cases of sampl 
fraud and mismanagement and scores of similar lawsuits could be 
filed by the fdic but neil bushs case is different as a symbol 
of the thrift crisis he could become a political liability for his 
father and the republican party in a 500billion campaign issue 
neil mallon bush born on jan 22 1955 was recently described 
by the president as probably the most sensitive of the four boys 
maybe the secondmost sensitive a good kid his childhood 
problems with dyslexia inspired his mothers avid interest in 
reading programs 
he was 30 years old when he joined the silverado board a 
tender age to assume such a position of trust at a federally 
insured institution only 1 percent of all savings and loan 
directors were under 35 in 1988 according to a survey by the us 
league of savings institutions the average age of a thrift 
director was 57 
bushs only work in banking before becoming a silverado director 
was a summer job at republic national bank in dallas i worked in 
the trust department filling out forms he told regulators in a 
closed hearing last december 
the regulators have asserted bush was unqualified and 
untrained to be a savings and loan director although that 
doesnt excuse him they said 
flashback to the heady days of the oil industry in the american 
west in the early 1980s the iranian oil cutoff in 1979 had spawned 
skyrocketing prices and long aggravating waits in gasoline lines 
at home 
the rugged oil fields of colorado and wyoming which overnight 
had become economic to develop were gripped by a gold rush fever 
suddenly it seemed everyone was in the oil business legions of 
brash entrepreneurs swept into town eager to take risks and get a 
piece of the action 
neil bush was one of them he came to denver armed with a 
bachelors degree and an mba both from tulane university in new 
orleans and some experience working in his fathers 1980 
presidential campaign and his brother georges unsuccessful bid for 
congress in texas 
in the summer of 1980 bush was hired as a landman by amoco 
production co in denver negotiating oil leases 
neil was very very tough said tom vessels a denver oilman 
who negotiated lease deals with bush he also was allround 
curious asking more questions than most landmen recalled 
vessels who owns a small oil company bearing his name and is 
president of the independent petroleum association of mountain 
states 
few others in whats now left of the rockies oil industry seem 
to remember bush thats not surprising since there were scores of 
small independent oilmen in the region in those days 
ive never known anybody whos dealt with him in the oil 
business said bill owens executive director of the colorado 
petroleum association 
bush left amoco in late 1982 and set up an oil partnership with 
two geologists called jnb exploration co for an investment of only 
100 bush acquired 234 percent of the business 
for two years jnb drilled a succession of dry holes in 
wyomings powder river basin and failed to become profitable 
that was common in those days what was unusual oilmen say was 
how bushs silent partners kept pumping money into the business 
despite its track record 
the fact that bush was a son of the vice president likely had 
something to do with that his silent partners in jnb wealthy 
denver developers kenneth m good and bill l walters probably 
reckoned they might get more than oil from the millions of dollars 
they invested in bushs company 
influence and connections can often be as valuable as money to 
people like good and walters who were already heavy borrowers from 
highflying silverado when bush joined the board 
michael r wise the chairman of silverado at the time also 
knew the value of connections he was on the board of the us 
league the sampl industrys main lobbying group and had personal 
contacts with regulators 
in mid1985 wise invited bush to join the board of silverado 
which was at the zenith of its gogo period 
silverado was making huge loans for grandiose real estate 
schemes right and left though many of the ventures were never 
finished the thrift was a gold mine for fastandloose developers 
since it was playing with depositors money that was insured by the 
federal government 
good and walters two of the biggest borrowers got a combined 
117 million in loans that they never repaid the leading borrower 
bell savings and loan association of san mateo calif got 1248 
million its chairman at the time david butler pleaded guilty 
last year to loan fraud and was sentenced to two years in prison 
management of silverado took excessive risks engaged in 
abusive or questionable practices to generate shortterm gains and 
undertook innovative manipulations to avoid recording losses the 
office of thrift supervision said in a report published last may 
the board did little beyond rubber stamping the activities of 
silverados sophisticated bright and manipulative management 
team 
as a director bush voted to approve loans including some of 
the projects sponsored by good and walters the regulators have 
accused him of conflict of interest in not disclosing to silverado 
his links with the two developers through jnb 
bush denies the allegations he concedes however that his 
family ties helped him get the silverado position 
i would be naive if i were to sit here and deny that the bush 
name didnt have something to do with it he said in a recent 
interview with time magazine maybe the advantage of being part 
of the vice presidents family at the time was that i was accepted 
more quickly in terms of age and years in this community denver 
than others of my peer group 
the family name however has become a doubleedged sword 
because he is the presidents son bush has captured the public 
imagination more than any other player in the national sampl drama 
the unsigned jail neil bush posters havent reached main 
street but across the country neil bushs face is now recognized 
by many of the taxpayers who will have to shell out 2000 each to 
cover thrift losses

soaring oil prices arent expected to 
create any abrupt increases in coal prices but experts agree the 
coal industry could receive a much needed boost if oil prices 
remain high 
i think youre very unlikely to see any massive switching 
from oil to coal said john gresser of the national coal 
association but he said the industry is in a good position to 
increase production if other countries move from oil to coal 
coal prices have remained fairly stable at 22 to 26 a ton in 
recent months because of intense domestic and foreign competition 
experts said 
gresser said coal doesnt compete directly with oil so a rise 
in oil prices has little effect on coal 
and he said us utilities cannot quickly switch from burning 
oil to burning coal in power plants 
but experts said more plants in european can be converted and 
there the sale of coal may increase 
we could see maybe a jump in european demand from 3 million 
to 6 million tons wyn holbrock of the at massey coal co in 
richmond va told the charleston daily mail 
japanese plants can also switch from oil to coal analysts said 
in europe and the far east there is a distinct possibility 
over a longer trend of time that the price of coal as an exporter 
would be impacted said mark cohen a coal analyst for kidder 
peabody and co 
wayne t ewing president of peabody development co and 
chairman of the national coal association said the demand for coal 
exports will be greater if the oil crisis continues especially 
because prices are soon to be negotiated for next year 
if this thing continues to escalate it will have some effect 
here in the us ewing said 
the experts said oil prices must continue to remain high 
however before the us coal industry will see major results 
high oil prices must stick around for a long time with 
implications of no improvement said rafael villagran an analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc 
if some utilities do switch to coal they can be assured of a 
large supply gresser said he said 1 billion tons of coal will be 
produced this year and the coal industry can easily increase 
production 
after the last oil embargo people thought there would be more 
of a demand for coal gresser said many people purchased coal 
mines and that capacity is still there to meet any sort of 
increased demands 
but villagren cautioned that an increased european demand for 
coal does not necessarily help us coal producers 
the us has stiff competition from the australians and the 
far east he said

invasion and subsequent occupation of kuwait are unknown there has 
been speculation however that the struggling us economy could 
be pushed into recession

gold futures prices fell wednesday and copper futures climbed as 
a downturn in oil prices prompted an abrupt change in speculation 
about the economy 
on other commodity markets pork futures fell sharply cattle 
extended their gains and grains and soybeans were mixed 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures settled 120 to 
150 lower with the contract for delivery in august at 38320 a 
troy ounce silver futures finished 15 cents to 18 cents lower 
with august at 4843 a troy ounce 
copper futures ended 2 cents to 365 cents higher on the 
commodity exchange with august at 131 a pound 
the moves reflected a shift away from the inflation and 
recession fears that began building late last week when iraq 
invaded kuwait and touched off a runup in oil prices and a plunge 
in stock prices worldwide 
the gold market responds quickly to inflation fears because the 
metal is perceived as an investment hedge against inflation copper 
is used heavily throughout the construction and manufacturing 
industries so its price is especially sensitive to signs of 
economic expansion or recession 
economy jitters eased wednesday as the price of crude oil fell 
and the us stock market rebounded partly in reaction to the 
movement of us forces into saudi arabia to defend against iraqi 
threats to oilproducing nations beyond kuwait 
analysts said word that saudi arabia venezuela and other major 
oilproducing nations would increase their output also worked to 
suppress crude prices 
opec president sadek boussena urged members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries to avoid such individual 
intiatives 
but tom bentz director of trading with united energy inc said 
opec is likely to cooperate with the cartels customers 
its not in their best interest to let prices go to 35 or 40 
a barrel because then people start looking for alternative sources 
of energy bentz said 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures settled 83 cent to 
235 lower on the new york mercantile exchange with the september 
contract at 2596 a barrel heating oil was 246 cents to 501 
cents lower with september at 7013 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 213 cents to 38 cents lower with september at 7621 
cents a gallon 
pork futures plummeted on the chicago mercantile exchange 
reflecting seasonal factors and a bulge in hog production 
weve had a year of good profitability in the hog market and 
were beginning to see the results in increased slaughter said 
thomas morgan president of sterling research corp in arlington 
heights ill 
most hog contracts and some belly contracts fell their permitted 
daily limits of 15 cents and 2 cents respectively 
live hogs finished 122 to 15 cents lower with august at 5657 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 32 cent to 2 cents lower 
with august at 5075 cents a pound 
cattle futures rose moderately extending strong gains posted

cash markets 
live cattle futures ended 02 cent to 23 cent higher with 
august at 78 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 
28 cent higher with august at 8995 cents a pound 
wheat futures rose modestly on the chicago board of trade 
following news of export sales of the grain and speculation that 
more such sales may be in the works corn and soybean futures edged 
lower 
sales of us wheat to egypt mexico and algeria were confirmed 
wednesday said katharina zimmer grain analyst with merrill lynch

new jersey regulators ruled wednesday that 
more than 1000 pages of documents detailing donald trumps 
financial rescue package must be made public but they still 
remained secret while his lawyers appeal the decision 
the casino control commission which must approve the plan 
involving trumps three atlantic city casinos said the release 
would not constitute an unwarranted invasion of trumps private 
business dealings the publics interest in casino operations takes 
precedence over trumps desire to keep his business affairs 
private the commission ruled 
the commission is expected to hold a public hearing on the 
restructuring plan within the next month 
trump lawyer joseph fusco argued that the documents contain 
sensitive financial information much of which has nothing to do 
with his casino holdings he also argued the arrangement with the 
banks has not yet been made final and the release of information 
could jeopardize negotiations 
fusco obtained a delay and will appear before superior court 
jude arnold stein thursday in morristown in his effort to reverse 
the commissions ruling 
only one document trumps application to the commission for 
approval of the financial package was released before trumps 
lawyers obtained the legal delay 
commission chairwoman valerie armstrong said it was virtually 
impossible to understand that document without examining the host 
of other financial reports 
the application appeared to shed little new light on trumps 
financial arrangement with nine banks to make ends meet over the 
next three to five years 
it reports that trump will receive a 65 million line of credit 
and will be able to defer about 85 million in annual interest 
payments for between three and five years 
under the agreement trump for the first time is using his 
casinos as collateral for financial assistance the agreement with 
the banks will restructure about 1 billion of his 13 billion 
casino debt and 19 billion in other debts 
in exchange for providing the fresh credit trumps rescuers 
have gained some control over his holdings and will closely monitor 
his personal and business dealings for years to come the agreement 
also requires him to appoint a senior executive officer to oversee 
his operations 
sources have reported that the 65 million bailout and debt 
restructuring package also requires trump to sell assets to raise 
cash but the document released wednesday did not refer to the sale 
of assets 
trump has discussed selling his trump shuttle and the trump 
princess the 282foot yacht he bought for 30 million 
trump has confirmed in the past that the agreement limits his 
household and personal spending to 450000 a month for the rest of 
this year 
the banks hope that by deferring about half of his 2 billion 
bank debt for up to five years trump will gain time to sell his 
assets in an orderly way 
the document released wednesday also says the restructuring will 
protect the trump casinos from claims by creditors and will not 
affect the payment terms of the casino indebtedness 
the three casinos and their indebtedness are trump taj mahal 
725 million trump plaza 275 million and trumps castle hotel 
and casino 402 million 
the documents were public information for about two hours but 
commission officials refused to allow reporters to see the 
material saying copies were being made about two hours later and 
after only one of the one less important documents had been copied 
and released trumps lawyers obtained the legal delay

employees walked off the job at a general 
motors corp parts plant wednesday in a strike gm officials said 
could shut down other assembly plants 
the walkout at gms ac rochester division flint west plant came 
after negotiations on employee grievances about health and safety 
issues broke off about 925 am said duane zuckschwerdt a united 
auto workers union bargainer 
hopefully it wont be a long strike zuckschwerdt said 
were obviously disappointed said gm president lloyd reuss 
reached at a meeting at traverse city 
reuss estimated that the walkout could force production cuts or 
shutdowns at six to eight assembly plants he declined to identify 
which plants could be affected but said i would expect the 
assembly plants to be impacted in the next two to three days 
with a typical assembly plant employing 5000 people or more 
the numbers of employees affected could be in the tens of 
thousands gm spokesman john maciarz said 
the strike would affect other plants that rely on justintime 
delivery of parts made at the plant in flint under the 
justintime system such parts as gas tanks van doors and grilles 
are shipped as needed rather than kept in storage 
there are no big warehouses out in back any more maciarz 
said 
if the strike at the 2800employee flint complex isnt 
resolved he said certainly a large number of our assembly 
operations would be impacted and other supplier divisions would be 
impacted because of not being able to send parts to assembly 
plants by monday anyway we would begin to see an impact 
maciarz said gm negotiators were ready to continue talks with 
the union but he didnt know when they might resume 
zuckschwerdt said bargainers from uaw local 659 representing 
the ac rochester workers and gm had met until 840 pm tuesday 
and reconvened at 6 am wednesday 
because the impact would spread rapidly to other plants and 
other employees the local is under pressure not only from gm but 
from other uaw locals said david cole director of the office for 
the study of automotive transportation at the university of 
michigan 
reuss wouldnt speculate on whether the flint walkout would have 
any impact on national contract talks going on between the big 
three automakers and the uaw you dont want to read too much 
into this he said 
he said gm will be pressing for a settlement because its car 
inventories are at their lowest point since the early 1980s

the us economy was slackening well before 
higher oil prices following the iraqi invasion of kuwait threatened 
to push it closer to a recession the federal reserve reported 
wednesday 
while a survey of the 12 fed districts found the nations 
economy continuing to grow most noted that the pace was slow or 
had slackened recently the central bank said in releasing its 
beige book a periodic economic assessment 
many economists fear higher energy costs could shock an already 
soft economy into recession 
the us chamber of commerce on wednesday predicted that even 
without higher energy costs the economy would grind to a 
standstill during the current quarter and then fall into a 
recession starting in the fourth quarter 
the federal reserve bank of atlanta completed the survey july 27 
for use at the aug 21 meeting of the central banks federal open 
market committee 
the committee which establishes us monetary policy adopted a 
tight credit policy more than a year ago to slow the economy and 
lessen inflationary pressures but as evidence of a weakening 
economy mounted even before the middle east eruption many 
officials and economists were calling for a looser grip to 
stimulate growth 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said wednesday he and 
president bush want the fed give economic growth a boost by 
lowering interest rates saying strong growth is particularly 
important as the united states responds to iraqs invasion 
everybody wants lower interest rates at this point in 
time in the united states economic growth is very important he 
said told a news conference 
meanwhile the chairman of the presidents council on economic 
advisers said it was too soon to forecast accurately the potential 
effects of recent oil price increases on the nations economy 
it could be significant and it could be modest michael 
boskin said in traverse city mich while attending a management 
seminar for the kinds of price increases weve seen thus far 
its likely that the economy would be able to absorb them 
but he said if the price of crude oil settles in a 25 to 28 a 
barrel range as has been estimated it would shave 05 to 07 
percentage points off of increases in the gross national product 
and would add one percentage point to the consumer price index 
then the inflation rate would drift back down he said 
the commerce department reported the economy grew at a meager 
12 percent annual rate in the quarter ending june 30 and just 17 
percent in the previous threemonth period another sign of a 
slowing economy came last friday when the labor department reported 
unemployment rose to 55 percent the highest level in two years 
while the feds latest survey found sluggish growth continuing 
in the third quarter it also indicated inflation was not subsiding 
it said wages in some districts were rising between 3 percent 
and 5 percent in most cases excluding benefits at the same time 
some districts reported widespread price increases while other said 
businesses were having to absorb higher costs at the expense of 
profit margins 
retail sales were generally described as a little better than 
a year ago or soft with weakerthanexpected demand for bigticket 
items cited most often the survey said 
retailers in new york city are less optimistic about the 
outlook given the continuing layoffs at banks and brokerage firms 
while those in st louis expressed similar views in light of 
anticipated defense cutbacks it added 
residential real estate construction and sales were below their 
1989 pace often because of high inventories which in many cases 
caused falling prices the survey found the soft housing industry 
also was causing weak sales of home furnishings and appliances 
overall manufacturing activity was flat the survey found 
although it varied from industry to industry 
demand for domestic steel was up partly due to auto production 
at the same time the survey found vehicle sales either flat or 
below yearago levels 
but with the exception of steel and commercial aircraft 
manufacturing inventories and lead times were said to be slowing 
most districts also reported employment was either flat or 
likely to weaken based on announced layoffs 
several districts report that the pace of commercial loan 
growth has recently slowed and some indicate that its levels are 
below those of a year ago the survey found 
lending to consumers also was off but not to the extent of 
commercial loans 
the survey found the outlook for agricultural production 
generally good although poor weather conditions were hurting crops 
in some areas

american airlines said wednesday it 
would raise fares by 10 percent because of skyrocketing fuel costs 
resulting from the persian gulf crisis 
michael w gunn the airlines senior vice president for 
marketing said the increase will go into effect friday for flights 
in the continental united states hawaii and the caribbean and on

in recent days pan american world airways and northwest 
airlines said they would raise their fares because of soaring fuel 
costs 
every onecent increase in the price per gallon of jet fuel adds 
more than 2 million a month to the airlines costs smith said 
american airlines uses more than 200 million gallons of jet fuel 
each month american airlines spokesman tim said

united airlines parent company wednesday gave an 
employee buyout group an extra two months to arrange financing for 
its 438 billion bid 
ual corps board of directors said it was willing to extend the 
deadline which was due to expire thursday because of the crisis 
in the middle east 
the buyout group reported that the recent turmoil in the world 
oil markets had slowed the progress of its discussions with 
financing sources ual said in a statement wednesday evening 
after a regular meeting of the directors 
the company said however that if financing is not arranged by 
the new deadline oct 9 ual will terminate the buyout agreement 
it reached with united airlines employees last april 
the directors indicated that they had doubts about the efforts 
chances of success 
ual emphasized that especially in light of events in the 
middle east state of the financial markets and softening economy 
there can be no assurance that a transaction can be completed 
the statement said 
there was no immediate comment from the united employee 
acquisition corp the group formed to buy ual 
a man who answered the telephone at the groups office but 
refused to give his name said there would be no comment wednesday 
samuel buttrick a stock market analyst who follows ual for 
kidder peabody amp co in new york said the middle east crisis had 
exacerbated trouble the group was already having obtaining 
financing 
the buyout group got a boost earlier in teh day when the los 
angeles banking company security pacific corp said it had joined 
two new york banks in loan talks with the employees 
some industry analysts have speculated the employees would 
restructure or reduce their 201pershare offer which uals board 
accepted april 6 
the ual statement said the directors had instructed its advisers 
to engage in further discussions with the employee group to 
explore any changes in financial structure that may be necessary to 
obtain financing 
company spokesman robert doughty would not elaborate 
earlier wednesday ual stock recovered some ground it had lost 
in trading during the last couple weeks 
analysts said the rally in uals stock after a plunge of 38 
percent in less than two weeks stemmed mainly from wednesdays 
sharp drop in oil prices 
uals stock rose 1350 to 11450 a share wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange 
uals stock tumbled from 163 to 101 a share in the seven 
business days ending tuesday amid waning investor confidence that 
the deal would get done 
much of the skepticism was prompted by the withdrawal of three 
large new york banks chase manhattan corp chemical banking 
corp and citicorp from a fivebank group that had begun loan 
talks with the buyout group 
the two remaining banks bankers trust new york corp and
