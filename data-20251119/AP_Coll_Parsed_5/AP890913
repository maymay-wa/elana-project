thirteenyearold chantee charles thought shed 
made the wrong impression but if she were to do it over again 
shed still let president bush have a piece of her mind 
as it happened bush took it in stride when the arlington va 
youngster delivered a surprise lecture against the death penalty 
during an antidrug ceremony at the white house on wednesday 
to me killing someone that has committed a very serious crime 
is wrong chantee told the rose garden crowd assembled to honor 
the drug abuse resistence education project dare it does not 
solve anything all it does is take someone elses life 
bush a longtime backer of capital punishment and an advocate of 
extending the death penalty to drug kingpins hardly seemed put off 
by his youthful critic indeed he complimented chantee and two 
other teenagers who also addressed the gathering for saying whats 
on your heart without worrying if people agree with you or not 
chantee said she had formulated her speech without really knowing 
that bush was such a staunch advocate of the death penalty and 
when first questioned about her speech by reporters thought i had 
made the wrong impression but white house aides later assured 
her just as the president did himself that no offense was taken 
she said 
in any case she wouldnt have done anything differently she 
added in dare classes they teach you not to stoop down to 
pressures to be your own person and not let your friends take you 
down she said its important for me to know that other people 
know how i really feel 
her white house surprise was reminiscent of an episode nearly 20 
years ago when a young madison wis woman debra jean sweet 
admonished president nixon for his conduct of the vietnam war after 
he had presented her with a medal for exceptional public service 
nixon had drawn her ire when he contrasted her with the very 
small minority of young americans who have lost faith in their 
country she retorted that i cannot believe in your sincerity 
until you get us out of vietnam later she explained that i saw 
him using me as a symbol and i refused to become that symbol

el salvadors leftist rebels opened their 
first peace talks in two years with government representatives 
wednesday by offering to end their civil war and reorganize as a 
political party in exchange for reforms 
it was the first time the rebel farabundo marti national 
liberation front said it would participate in the political process 
as part of the path toward peace 
the rebel plan called for the civil war to end in six months 
there is a very good climate said gregorio rosa chavez 
auxiliary bishop of san salvador who is observing the talks he 
said the government also made a proposal but he refused to discuss 
it 
after mondays session ended salvadoran justice minister oscar 
alfredo santamaria told a news conference the talks were held in a 
positive atmosphere 
we feel satisfied he said of progress made 
santamaria said the government proposed it meet rebel 
representatives for two days every two months with the roman 
catholic church acting as observer and not as mediator 
he was reluctant to predict any outcome 
what will happen i dont know santamaria said 
farabundo marti leaders outlined their plan in a statement before 
talks opened to end the decadeold war that has cost more than 
70000 lives aside from the political participation offer little 
in it was new 
the guerrillas demanded that president alfredo cristianis 
rightist administration reform the judiciary prosecute human rights 
violators and end all political repression and undertake 
constitutional and land reforms 
they proposed that ultrarightists be weeded out of the judicial 
system and the military now made up of 56000 soldiers be 
restructured and cut down 
they also asked the government to move up the date of el 
salvadors 1991 legislative and municipal elections and allow them 
to participate as a party 
in exchange the guerrillas said they would agree to a ceasefire 
starting no later than nov 15 and would begin to integrate 
themselves into el salvadors political life 
we are not negotiating from a position of weakness said 
joaquin villalobos a senior guerrilla leader 
he said the talks will test the cristiani administrations desire 
for peace 
cristiani refused to answer questions at a brief public 
appearance in san salvador 
miguel saenz a rebel spokesman told reporters the participants 
began by discussing procedural matters and an agenda 
many rebel demands similar to those made wednesday were rejected 
by the rightistdominated military in three previous negotiating 
sessions from 1984 to 1987 
villalobos said wednesday that the rebels want a quick end to the 
war he said the salvadoran people are tired of fighting we are 
conscious the war has to end 
many of the victims of the war against a succession of 
usbacked governments have been civilians 
after a ceasefire and government recognition of the rebels as a 
political party a lasting peace would be negotiated with the front 
laying down its arms villalobos said 
cristiani invited the guerrillas to lay down their arms and 
engage in peace talks when he succeeded president jose napoleon 
duarte for a fiveyear term june 1 
rebel and government called a temporary ceasefire for the 
twoday peace talks 
the government said earlier it will not negotiate a reduction in 
the military and that if the rebels want reform they should pursue 
it through the political process 
the rebels boycotted regular elections since 1982 saying such 
elections offer only a veneer of democracy

a federal appeals court wednesday blocked a 
judges order setting 200000 bail for the brotherinlaw of 
mexicos former president after prosecutors sought time to appeal 
the decision 
the 9th us circuit court of appeal granted a stay on the order 
issued tuesday by us district court judge robert takasugi the 
order would have resulted in freedom for ruben zuno arce 59 a 
mexican businessman linked by authorities to drug trafficking he 
has been in prison since aug 9 
the appeals court gave prosecutors until monday to appeal the 
release order and gave the defense until sept 25 to file responses 
well just have to abide by the courts order and wait for the 
ruling said zunos attorney edward medvene 
zuno was charged with perjury before a federal grand jury last 
week after spending nearly a month in custody without being charged 
with any crime he was held initially as a material witness in the 
1985 torture murder of us drug enforcement agent enrique camarena 
prosecutors contend that zuno a millionaire who has vast 
business holdings in mexico would flee to his native country and 
never return if he is freed 
zunos sister is the wife of former mexican president luis 
echeverria 
takasugi who ruled that zuno could not be held without bail 
said that the defendant could sign a waiver of extradition and a 
promise to return to federal court when he is summoned 
the government wants zuno to testify in the trial of a recently 
charged defendant in the camarena case juan jose bernaberamirez a 
former member of the jailisco state judicial police 
prosecutors have linked zuno to the sale of a home in guadalajara 
that was subsequently bought by mexican drug lord rafael 
caroquintero authorities believe camarena was murdered at the 
house 
zunos lawyers say the house was sold through an intermediary and 
zuno knew nothing about the murder 
caro who is accused of orchestrating the murders is in custody 
awaiting trial in mexico city seven more men are charged with 
murder and conspiracy in the case 
zuno testified before a federal grand jury for two days and 
another judge ruled then that he had little information to offer and 
should be released at that point immigration officials demanded 
his return to san antonio texas for investigation of whether he 
was a narcotics trafficker 
while in texas he was charged with perjury in los angeles and 
was returned again he was accused of lying when he said he didnt 
know caro or ernesto fonseca carillo another key defendant in the 
camarena case 
prosecutors have said they consider zuno significant in the 
camarena investigation but have refused to say why

singer freddie jackson has been touring and the 
tour has brought him to broadways luntfontanne theater through 
sunday as he says from the stage he feels much satisfaction 
because as a boy in harlem he expected to be on broadway only by 
attending one of the streets movie theaters 
jackson sings contemporary rhythm n blues with an emphasis on 
love ballads theres also an emphasis on an uptempo beat and a 
fervent delivery this is no limpid romantic ballad singing its 
more sexy than romantic the band is loud not until jackson sang 
for all we know as a tribute to the late donny hathaway bending 
notes and getting fervent with that one too could all the words of 
a song be heard 
on the second night of jacksons up close and personal show 
on wednesday the luntfontanne wasnt full but the audience was 
with jackson all the way he entered through a white door at the top 
of white stairs wearing a white suit the short jacket edged in gold 
braid and gold epaulets widening his shoulders this didnt hide the 
fact that the rest of jackson is wide too but the audience 
responded to his dance steps and suggestive swaying with apparent 
ecstacy women in the front row vied to mop his perspiring brow 
jackson did a medley of hits he has had since his first record in 
1985 a high point of the show was i do the duet he recorded 
with natalie cole sung here with one of his three backup singers 
the evening began with 20 minutes by comic michael winslow whose 
forte is making noises into a microphone of door locks a dog a 
car an airplane hes clever with an engaging manner and one 
would enjoy him more if not worried that one of his shrieks would 
pierce an eardrum 
regina belle a singer in the general style of anita baker had 
the middle slot between the two intermissions she has the voice 
the range the vocal stamina and the stage presence to hold and 
excite the audience with each song 
she doesnt yet have what jackson does the thread that ties 
different songs together and makes each one belong to the singer 
whos singing them

an allegedly obsessed fan of tiffany was 
barred by a court order from telephoning closely observing or 
blocking the movements of the 17yearold singer 
a superior court commissioner also ruled wednesday that 
35yearold jeff deane turner of santa cruz must remain at least 200 
yards from tiffanys home recording studios and sites of her 
concert appearances 
turner was arrested in june 1988 in los angeles after trying to 
present tiffany whose full name is tiffany darwish with a bouquet 
and a samurai sword 
i had never seen or heard of the defendant prior to that 
time the singer said in a sworn statement apparently hes an 
obsessed fan 
in her petition tiffany said turner later appeared at a northern 
california promotion and kissed me and walked with his arm around 
me the defendant sent me numerous letters one of which states god 
wants us to be together 
the singer said in her statement that turner obtained her home 
address in la mirada from the department of motor vehicles the same 
way that a man accused of killing rebecca schaeffer allegedly 
obtained the actress address

the house on thursday rejected a senate effort 
led by jesse helms to prohibit federal funds to support sexually 
explicit or blasphemous art 
on a 264153 vote the house defeated a motion that would have 
committed it to the restrictions helms wants to impose on the 
national endowment for the arts 
rep sidney yates dill the endowments chief supporter in the 
house argued successfully that the arts restrictions would amount 
to censorship and lead to the lingering death of the 25yearold 
agency 
endowment critics upset over the use of federal funds this year 
for photography exhibits that included a picture of christ on a 
cross in a jar of urine and photos of homosexual acts denied there 
would be censorship they said people have a right to demand that 
tax dollars not be spent to subsidize art they abhor 
the question is sponsorship not censorship said freshman 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif who led the fight on the house 
floor on behalf of helms senatebacked amendment artists can do 
whatever they want on their own time and with their own dime 
democrats united behind yates however voting against accepting 
helms measure by a margin of 21237 house republicans whose 
campaign committee already has used the issue against incumbent 
democrats supported helms measure 11652 
were telling jesse we respect freedom of expression rep 
don edwards dcalif said after the vote 
the battle is not over however helms succeeded in having the 
senate place the arts restrictions in an overall spending bill for 
the endowment and several other agencies 
the house and senate have yet to agree on a final version for the 
10 billion bill and senate negotiators can still fight for the 
arts restrictions when the two sides meet in conference 
the debate now shifts to the hinterland said rohrabacher 
whose failed motion would have instructed house negotiators to yield 
to helms language i believe there will be another house vote 
on this i believe sen helms has a few rabbits up his sleeve 
for more than a month a coalition of 22 christian conservative 
and republican groups have waged a campaign characterizing yates 
planned maneuver as a smoke screen and sham 
yates said helms measure would reach far beyond what the 
democrat said were mistakes by the endowment in awarding grants this 
year for promoting the two controversial exhibits 
it establishes a broad and sweeping pattern of censorship 
yates said this is the start of george orwells big brother its 
the communist approach to art 
before the vote wednesday democratic leaders thwarted an effort 
by supporters of the helms measure to press their point by 
displaying copies of the offending photographs on the house floor 
rep george brown dcalif who was presiding over the house at 
the time denied the request saying the exhibit would upset the 
decorum of the house the sergeant of arms also was ordered to cover 
up a display in the speakers lobby outside the chamber 
the controversy began last spring as a small protest against an 
indirect 15000 award by the national endowment for the arts to 
photographer andre serrano whose exhibited work includes a picture 
of christ on a cross submerged in a jar of urine 
it then mushroomed when the corcoran gallery of art in 
washington fearing a cut in its funds from the endowment in june 
canceled a show by the late photographer robert mapplethorpe that 
included photos of homosexual acts and nude children 
the secondranking officer of the corcoran and the organizer of 
the mapplethorpe show jane livingston resigned wednesday saying 
she planned to complete a book she said that though she was 
appalled at the cancellation done without consulting her her 
resignation very well may have happened now without any of the 
otehr events 
yates who chairs the house subcommittee responsible for the 
endowments annual appropriation tried to douse the flames two 
months ago by cutting its 1714 million budget for next year by 
45000 the amount of federal grants that went toward the two 
controversial exhibits 
unappeased critics turned to helms who two weeks later and 
with no voiced opposition attached his amendment to the senates 
version of the appropriations bill 
helms amendment would prohibit the endowment from awarding any 
grants to museums and artists for promoting or producing obscene 
or indecent material including depicitions of sadomasochism 
homoeroticism the exploitation of children or individuals engaged 
in sex acts 
it also bans support for art that denigrates the objects or 
beliefs of a particular religion or nonreligion or denigrates 
debases or reviles a person group or class of citizens on the basis 
of race creed sex handicap or national origin

while insisting that its problem with 
murderous drug traffickers is due to americans craving for cocaine 
colombia is finding it has a drug abuse problem of its own 
more than one in 10 colombians use drugs regularly and almost 5 
percent of children age 12 and younger have tried them according to 
an as yet unreleased government study obtained by the associated 
press 
when the drug use study conducted by the ministry of education is 
made public it is bound to shock this proud latin american country 
many colombians are fond of saying that drug abuse violence and 
lust for pornography are problems characterizing americans 
colombian society prides itself on its traditional values such as 
family unity and respect for elders 
president virgilio barco in speeches in washington and on 
nationwide television has repeated his message tirelessly united 
states drug users are ultimately to blame for drug trafficking in 
colombia 
the colombian government does not have a national program to 
prevent or treat drug addiction but it is spending money on 
advertising pointing to american addicts 
an ad being run in current government magazines and picked up by 
newspapers shows what is supposed to be a frecklefaced american 
woman snorting cocaine through a straw 
because of her cocaine habit she is directly supporting the 
drug terrorists who are tearing apart our country the ad says 
shes like thousands of young americans rich and poor alike 
addicted to cocaine 
the statistics of the colombian study are based upon lengthy 
questionnaires given to 7513 colombians from a wide social and 
geographic spectrum 
the study said 45 percent of colombians age 12 and under have 
tried drugs and gave these figures for young people of other age 
groups 
1315 years old 208 percent 
1618 years old 471 percent 
1921 years old 595 percent 
the most frequently used drugs in order of use are marijuana 
basuco cocaine heroin hashish lsd and even hallucinogenic 
mushrooms the study says 
basuco is the brown residue scraped from the inside of a 
container after preparing cocaine base it is smoked like crack 
cocaine base has not yet been treated with hydrochloric acid for 
making pure cocaine and is therefore said to be weaker than crack 
the results of the colombian study were so shocking that a 
followup study was done of 30000 colombians age 15 and older to 
see how many use drugs on a steady basis the head of the education 
ministry study gabriel gutierrez garcia told the ap 
twelve percent of those questioned use illegal drugs on a regular 
basis the study showed according to gutierrez 
there is no visible federal campaign against drug use in 
colombia whatever minor programs there are scattered throughout the 
country are supposed to directed and coordinated by colombias 
national drug council 
however one of the councils administrators maria mercedes 
sanchez said she did not know how much the government spends on 
drug prevention 
there is nothing identifiable in the colombian governments 
budget for prevention and treatment of drug addiction 
ap inquiries about government drug programs that might exist did 
not turn up a single program 
the health ministry contributes 2500 a year to operation of the 
countrys largest drug rehabilitation clinic the director of the 
clinic in bogota maria isabel salagar de lince told the ap 
it isnt much but every little bit helps she said in an 
interview about the clinic that treats 1000 people a year she said 
the bogota clinic is privately run and nonprofit 
mrs lince said she believes there are 10 other clinics in the 
country but knows nothing about them she said the national drug 
council emphasizes drug enforcment rather than prevention and cure 
the government has no drug rehabiliation centers 
bogota mayor andres pastrana elected last year for a twoyear 
term has created a corps of 75 psychologists and 25 other workers 
to inform teachers and pupils about the dangers of drug addiction 
gloria inez garcia an administrator with the program told the ap 
there are no federal programs against drug addicition or for 
helping cure people of addiction miss garcia said in an interview 
as for the bogota mayors program it is unlikely it will survive 
when pastrana is replaced next august 
colombian mayors elected every two years cannot run for 
reelection and new mayors almost always wipe out the social 
programs of predecessors 
the most visible nationwide campaign against drug addiction was 
by colombias privately owned banco cafetero coffee growers bank 
three years ago posters billboards and radio and television spots 
warned people of the dangers of drug addiction 
on television an actor portraying a drug addict changed on the 
screen from normallooking to beastly 
the colombian government often relies on the private sector to 
assume responsibility for such campaigns even signs announcing to 
drivers that a military base lies ahead often carries accompanying 
advertising by the company that paid for the sign 
access to drugs in colombia is literally as easy as buying a 
hotdog from a street vendor it is common knowledge the vendors sell 
drugs 
an ap reporter living here 10 years has seen farmers making 
cocaine base in small open laboratories in the jungle and the high 
andes mountains 
the operations are widespread with farmers often testing their 
product before sending it by a motorcycle messenger to the nearest 
city 
drugs are cheap here a kilo 22 pounds of cocaine costs just 
1100 in bogota compared to 11000 to 15000 in miami 
in discotheques in wealthy parts of the capital of bogota a city 
of 6 million people customers openly buy cocaine and other drugs 
from waiters or pay a waiter to have the doorman go out and buy them 
it is easy and simple to buy drugs on the street without even 
knowing anyone certain streets are wellknown for drug trafficking 
and a prospective buyer has only to touch his forehead with his 
right hand to signal a horde of drug vendors

many of the kids listening to the presidents grandfatherly 
advice that saying no wont make you a nerd found it just one 
more bit of wellmeaning advice from an adult far from the front 
lines in the drug war 
i dont think it had that much effect because drug dealers are 
going to still go out and deal and people are going to still go out 
and buy drugs because its addictive said jason mcnally a 
seventhgrader in elmhurst ill 
it needs a lot more to stop it said 10yearold amos dunn a 
fifthgrader in boston the only answer is not making any more 
drugs he concluded 
like amos other pupils who watched bushs televised speech 
tuesday demonstrated intimate awareness of the problem and many 
wondered if anything the president says is goingto make a difference 
tres whitlow a 12yearold classmate of jasons at carl sandburg 
junior high in the middleclass chicago suburb said warnings from 
parents or politicians pale beside pressure teenagers feel from 
their peers and from dealers to try drugs 
they see drug dealers tell them its going to make them do 
better said tres 12 
from roosevelt junior high school in glendale calif came 
comments much like some heard in congress 
i think he should have been tougher said katherine jo 
ninthgrade class president at the suburban los angeles school he 
doesnt know how bad it is 
some supported the president 
at sandburg 12yearold christine gershak took heart in the 
presidents message that there are people willing to help youths 
resist drugs i think it will make a big impact because the kids 
will like know what to do to go for help she said 
but classmate tania durdevic 12 noted bush didnt address one 
of the causes of drug abuse 
some kids might take drugs because they have family problems 
and think nobody likes them tania said but like my life is 
really good my family i know they care about me 
amos and his classmates at mattahunt elementary school in 
innercity boston were all too familiar with the dangers bush warned 
them about they see it on the streets and what they learn there 
often is embellished with what they get from television 
the white people are supplying it to black people who are 
selling it to black people like on tv said larry bates 11 it 
makes me feel bad seeing black people are using it im black im 
not going to be using it 
the teacher of the boston class ouida kalokoh warns her 
students about drugs but she didnt know the ingredients in crack 
until her pupils filled her in 
i was told everything and they were fourthgraders she 
said dismay in her voice they knew all about it

reformminded communists in 
hungary are gambling that by freeing thousands of east germans 
theyll pick up more western support than soviet bloc anger 
budapest took the potentially risky step of breaking ranks with 
its soviet bloc allies by opening the doors for east germans fed up 
with the countrys antiquated hardline leaders 
the soviet union has joined east germany in crying foul and 
czechoslovakia has also expressed displeasure 
but the criticism from hungarys allies has failed to stop 
premier miklos nemeth and his reformist colleagues in budapest 
at one level letting the refugees go shows hungarys respect for 
a cherished western value the right to travel as one pleases 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany almost 
on cue praised budapest for its new way of thinking and humane 
policies just hours after the exodus began on monday 
but much more importantly hungary has been looking for greater 
backing from the west in solving its economic woes 
thats the message the harvardeducated nemeth and his foreign 
minister gyula horn took to bonn in a surprise visit aug 25 when 
the logjam of east germans waiting in hungary was reaching a peak 
while both sides deny any deal was struck horn and nemeth 
reportedly told chancellor helmut kohl that they were looking for 
more economic support and for help in becoming more involved in 
the lucrative european economic community in return they would be 
willing to risk a warsaw pact schism by opening their border to the 
east germans 
hungary has been aiming for an associate membership in the eec a 
step that would represent a milestone for any eastern european 
country and the country is still basking in the glow of president 
bushs visit in july 
now hungary appears to be winning its gamble in breaking a 
20yearold agreement with east germany to prevent such escapes 
we will not forget this demonstration of humaneness kohl told 
reporters sunday evening hours before the refugees started pouring 
into bavaria 
kohl also told nationwide television that west germany which has 
been rushing to establish greater business ties in eastern europe 
will give full backing to the economic reforms in hungary 
not surprisingly hungary has been reaping approval in poland 
the other soviet bloc nation thats rushing toward westernstyle 
economic and political systems 
foreign minister horn is candid about the risks however 
there is a danger of hungary becoming isolated in eastern 
europe as some of the things hungary is doing irritate our neighbors 
and allies he told hungarian radio on aug 29 altering our 
approach however would mean curtailing our freedom of action 
east germany publicly has been about as vitriolic as a country 
can be toward an ally calling hungarys move organized 
provocation 
but hungary deftly exploited the leadership vacuum caused by east 
german leader erich honeckers prolonged recovery from gall bladder 
surgery even communist party functionaries are comparing east 
germany to a ship without a captain 
late monday prague radio said hungarys decision may call into 
question the future fate of other agreements within the warsaw 
pact countries 
significantly soviet politburo hardliner yegor k ligachev 
visited east berlin on tuesday to discuss the refugee situation 
rather than travel to budapest to tell the hungarians to get back in 
line 
still the soviets also have publicly denounced budapests 
decision 
the official news agency tass on monday criticized what it called 
a tendentious campaign in the west to encourage citizens to 
leave east germany tass said the campaign and propaganda 
hullabaloo were conducted to pressure east germany 
east germany is an inalienable part of the warsaw treaty 
tass said also calling the country our true friend and ally 
but as hungary is showing there are ever increasingly large 
cracks in the alliance that once resorted to tanks to crush dissent 
within the ranks

death dropped in at the blue banjo one 
sunday and nobody even noticed 
richard obennick and frank woodworth lay by the back steps for 
more than six hours on a 90degree day before anyone realized they 
werent asleep 
two nights later the jukebox blared a johnny cash song about a 
dallas bordello a haggard group of men lounged in the alley behind 
the blue banjo talking and sharing a jug on the sidewalk out front 
drug deals went down 
business as usual 
inside a couple of mexican farmworkers played pool on a ragged 
blueslate table a halfdozen men sat at barstools laughing once 
in a while and trading jokes with the bartender 
a blonde woman with a bandage wrapped around her hand and missing 
a front tooth danced a little as she walked from the jukebox to her 
table a man strutted behind her mimicking she turned and swiped 
him on the shoulder they laughed 
obennick and woodworth used to come in when they had cash 
they certainly take these fellows money readily enough and 
give them alcohol theyre friends as long as they have money 
said roger phillips who runs the 100bed union gospel mission 
robert maclemore a kitchen worker across town at the blue ox 
restaurant and obennicks sometime drinking buddy took a seat at 
the orange formicatopped bar he would go up and try to bum for 
money and i got to know him he would always be glad to see me 
coming he knew i always had money on me you see 
maclemore last saw obennick the wednesday before he died and 
gave him all of his bus fare so the transient could buy a quart of 
beer maclemore walked to work obennick was a nice person he 
really was but he was lonely he had something down inside of him 
that was eating him away he said 
obennick had a lot of good in him said phillips whose 
mission was the dead mens last address he always carried a 
trombone around and talked about playing it though phillips never 
actually saw him blow a note 
maclemore remembered woodworth as a quiet heavyset man who 
walked around on crutches and loved to drink wine he was older 
well he looked old but he wasnt as old as i am he was in his 
late 40s maybe early 50s 
after two autopsies and tests for poison the cause of 
obennicks and woodworths deaths on aug 6 remains a mystery the 
mens bodies sat in the latesummer heat a jug of almaden blush 
chablis between them long enough to start decomposing before 
anybody knew they were dead 
yakima county coroner leonard birkenbine wasnt surprised you 
go down there theres always somebody lying down like that 
the tavern with a blue neon sign thats read lue banjo as 
long as anyone could remember is in the tough section of yakima a 
central washington town of 50000 that is best known for apples 
cherries and vineyards but is fast developing a reputation as a 
rural drug center 
in a block wedged between a residential district and a restaurant 
strip are the blue banjo another tavern and a longvacant building 
with barred doors 
we did have an extensive problem some time ago down there 
said police capt don blesio for the most part the problem has 
been reduced considerably but were suffering from the cocaine and 
heroin problems that exist 
its tough there it really is maclemore said you can get 
hurt there you can get killed there 
bob briggs who said he was released from the washington state 
penitentiary in walla walla that day after serving eight years for 
burglary and auto theft watched the blue banjo scene from the 
corner barstool 
i asked where the toughest place in town was and they told me 
the blue banjo so i figured id better come try it out he said 
it couldnt be any tougher than walla walla 
the bar is a popular spot patrons wander in some for draft beer 
at 50 cents a glass some for the twoforaquarter cigarettes in a 
cubbyhole behind the bar two shelves are filled with fortified wines 
like thunderbird md 2020 and jugs of white port obennicks 
favorite 
while maclemore and others talked about obennick and woodworth 
a young woman walked in and ordered a beer the bartender asked for 
identification and instead of producing a drivers license she 
lifted her shirt and exposed her breasts she was kicked out 
we get that all the time said the bartender a burly man 
with a gravelly voice who asked that his name not be used ive 
got to kick her out or the cops would bust me for promoting 
prostitution 
two men staggered in and tried to order beer they were kicked 
out too 
he was like that the bartender said of obennick as they 
lurched out 
the cash register rang almost constantly after the bartender gave 
last call at 1145 pm maclemore downed one for the road and walked 
out through the shifting crowd outside 
coke coca two men asked making little sniffing motions 
maclemore ignored them and walked to the back of the building 
where a lone man rummaged through a trash bin the homeless 
jugsharers had left the spot where obennick and woodworth died 
was empty

the federal governments plan for a 9percent 
sales tax is bringing more than the usual number of protests from 
the canadian grassroots some analysts say the tax could cause 
tremendous upheaval in the economy 
there has to be a better solution said gus karagianis who 
has a placard outside his fruit king produce stand inviting 
passersby to sign a taxrevolt petition 
he showed off about 3200 signatures he said he had gathered in 
three weeks 
being a storeowner im capable of voicing my opinion he 
said regardless of whether it does any good or not just voice 
your opinion 
petitions some of them sponsored by newspapers telephone hot 
lines the inevitable slogan tshirts and buttons and even a tax 
protest song have sprung up since finance minister michael wilson 
announced the details in august of the proposed goods and services 
tax that would take effect in 1991 
the tax would replace an existing hidden 135percent 
manufacturers sales tax that the government says damages the 
canadian economys ability to compete the current tax for example 
applies only to goods manufactured domestically and not to imports 
wilson said the new tax would be revenue neutral for the 
government as compared to the current system but would raise the 
consumer price index by 225 percent in 1991 
the new tax would be felt by consumers for many goods and 
services not now covered from new houses to restaurant meals and 
even postage stamps 
basic groceries virtually all of the items sold in karagianis 
store would not be affected but the 33yearold shopkeeper said he 
believes that any measure that cuts into consumers spending power 
ultimately hurts his business 
you can only tighten the belt so much he said 
basic groceries prescription drugs health and dental care 
educational services day care and legal aid would be among the few 
categories left untouched by the new tax 
the edmonton sun newspaper in the western province of alberta 
said it has gathered from readers more than 15000 taxprotest 
coupons addressed to wilson there are a number of individuals and 
organizations who started petitions managing editor randy 
mcdonald said its been more of a grassroots thing 
taxes traditionally have been higher in canada than in the united 
states 
mcdonald said tax freedom day when citizens can stop thinking 
that their money is going to the government already is calculated 
for albertans as july 15 or 16 it was may 4 this year in the united 
states 
i think its just a matter of enoughs enough mcdonald said 
the toronto sun the edmontons suns sister newspaper in 
canadas largest city said it has taken in 138000 taxprotest 
coupons so far 
no central place has tabulated the number of canadians signing 
petitions or expressing opposition to the tax plan in other ways 
but critics of the plan say they hope that evidence of 
widespread visible discontent will persuade the government to alter 
or scrap the plan they note that it wont take effect until 1991 
when the next national election will be on the horizon and unpopular 
measures might be harder to take 
prime minister brian mulroneys progressive conservative party is 
in the first year of its second consecutive majority term another 
election will not have to be called for at least three years 
we are bringing in the new goods and services tax not because 
it is easy but because it is right mulroney told his partys 
recent convention 
wood gundy inc a prominent investments firm said in its highly 
publicized analysis of the tax plan that the inflationary impact 
would lead to higher interest rates and add to the federal budget 
deficit 
it said the bank of canada probably would use tight money policy 
to control price pressures and that unemployment would rise as a 
result possibly to 10 percent from its current level of 75 percent 
burns fry ltd said the government should call the proposed tax 
deficit neutral rather than revenue neutral as wilson 
characterized it 
the new tax would take in 47 billion 55 billion canadian 
more than is currently received but the funds would go out for 
refundable tax credits for those with income less than 25500 
30000 canadian which would lower the middleincome tax rate 
from 26 percent to 25 percent and pay for administrative costs 
the globe and mail newspaper in toronto said in an editorial 
both on the visibility and the impact of the tax the federal 
governments projections and hopes appear unrealistic and naive 
asking retailers consumers and workers to let the system work by 
being reasonable

colombias cocaine war has called 
attention to another battle the coffee war 
colombia blames the united states for a nosedive in the price of 
coffee which brought colombia almost 15 billion last year and is 
the south american nations top foreign exchange earner 
government officials here complain that what washington giveth 
with one hand such as military aid to fight drug traffickers the 
other hand taketh away in coffee revenue 
that is money that could be used for fighting drugs 
specifically colombia says the united states is to blame for the 
collapse of a 74nation agreement between coffee exporters and 
importers that set export quotas and assured colombians of decent 
earnings 
in july talks broke down after months of debate among the 
members of the international coffee accord to renew the agreement 
the member countries including suppliers and purchasers 
negotiate prices for one year the trouble was that some coffee 
producers in the pact were selling at cheap prices to nonmembers 
us officials said 
the united states said it would not support a new agreement until 
it had guarantees that purchasing countries outside the agreement 
would not get coffee for less than countries inside the pact 
a 50 percent drop in coffee prices to about 88 cents per pound 
is the worst slump since the late 1920s colombia could lose 200 
million in coffee revenue this year 
in a letter to president bush colombian president virgilio barco 
said the lack of a new agreement setting export quotas will have 
devastating consequences on the colombian economy 
this is a grave crisis and requires immediate attention 
barco told bush 
what neither barco nor any other colombian official will comment 
on is whether slumping cocaine sales also might have devastating 
consequences on the economy 
since drug trafficking and its earnings are secret by nature no 
one knows to what extent colombias economy depends on the cocaine 
trade 
studies by universities and other independent sources give widely 
varying figures some say drug money contributes 15 percent to 3 
percent of the nations gross national product 
if the figure is 3 percent that would be just over 1 billion a 
year colombia would lose if drug traffickers were driven out 
the nation has launched a vigorous crackdown on the drug trade 
since the assassination aug 18 of leading presidential candidate 
luis carlos galan 
after three weeks of the crackdown the colombian armed forces 
have seized more than 200 million in property from drug traffickers 
drug barons investments in real estate in colombia the last six 
years have been as high as 55 billion according to a story this 
year in the bogota daily el tiempo 
but unlike coffee earnings the drug trafficking money that 
enters the economy does not generate jobs 
a us narcotics official in bogota said recently that the 
crackdown on drugs has cut back cocaine shipments substantially but 
he had no idea exactly how much 
twenty percent 50 percent i dont know he said

leaders of polishamerican and jewishamerican 
groups are calling for a return to a 1987 agreement to move a roman 
catholic convent from the site of the auschwitz death camp 
the continuing issue over the carmelite convent has escalated 
in some quarters causing deep anguish to the point that it both 
breeds unnecessary hostility and makes a solution more difficult to 
achieve the leaders said in a statement tuesday 
it was signed by edward moskal president of the polish american 
congress ira silverman executive vice president of the american 
jewish committee and harold gales and the rev leonard chrobot 
cochairmen of the national polishamerican jewishamerican council 
the convent just outside the auschwitz concentration camp is seen 
by many jews and others as an intrusion of christian symbols at a 
place where 25 million jews were murdered by the nazis during world 
war ii 
a 1987 accord between jewish and roman catholic representatives 
stipulated the convent should be moved by feb 22 but the deadline 
passed and the convent remained the polish primate cardinal jozef 
glemp has termed the accord offensive 
the signers of tuesdays statement called for a return to the 
1987 agreement that recognizes both the nazi aim of destroying the 
jewish people in a unique unthinkable and unspeakable enterprise 
as well as the martyrdom of the polish people during the 
totalitarian horror throughout the war of 19391945 
the statement said the suffering of poles and the murder of 
polish catholics at auschwitz has not been adequately recognized or 
appreciated an estimated 15 million christians were killed at 
auschwitz 
at the same time it said jewish americans believe that the 
uniqueness of the mass murder of jews at auschwitz has not been 
understood or appreciated by nonjews

prospects for a peaceful settlement 
of ethiopias 28yearold civil war appear to be dim president 
mengistu haile mariam said tuesday 
speaking at a rally marking the 15th anniversary of the ethiopian 
revolution mengistu said no positive indications have emerged 
from preliminary peace talks in atlanta 
ethiopian officials are meeting in atlanta with leaders of the 
eritrean peoples liberation front in an attempt to map a plan for 
more substantive talks the negotiations are being guided by former 
president carter 
the latest indications from atlanta are that the opposition 
group is not interested in a peaceful solution of the conflict 
mengistu said 
the president said the eritrean front appears to be 
intransigent and adamant on its demands 
mengistu did not elaborate but in the past the eritrean front 
has demanded the people of eritrea be allowed to vote on whether 
they want independence federation with ethiopia or autonomy 
the government which has proposed a greater measure of autonomy 
for its northernmost province has unequivocally ruled out any 
referendum 
mengistus assessment of the talks was far more pessimistic than 
one given to reporters sunday by isaias afwerki the head of the 
rebel delegation in atlanta 
afwerki said the eritreans have reason to believe they are 
getting close to a solution but acknowledged that several points 
of contention were prolonging the talks 
mengistus 35minute speech was one of the shortest he has 
delivered on revolution day which marks the anniversary of the 
overthrow of the late emperor haile selassie

for more than a decade edward i koch led new 
york with a brash often combative style when he faced his last 
hurrah on tuesday he accepted defeat graciously and called his 
years in office glorious 
with his loss to manhattan borough president david dinkins in the 
democratic primary the 64yearold mayor was denied his goal of 
becoming the first fourterm mayor in the citys history 
i have had 12 glorious years as mayor koch declared in his 
concession speech urging his supporters not to feel sorry for him 
he said believe me there is a life after the mayoralty 
traditionally new yorks mayor is a national political figure 
but koch with his smartaleck remarks his eye for the television 
cameras his zest for his office became a worldwide celebrity 
he wrote a bestseller mayor and two other books he 
appeared on saturday night live he was interviewed in playboy 
and he was quoted ad infinitum jimmy carters brother billy 
was a wacko developer donald trump was piggy piggy piggy 
jews would have to be crazy to vote for jesse jackson 
that nasal feisty voice was unknown to most new yorkers when 
koch ran for mayor in 1977 his name was recognized by only 6 
percent of new yorkers outside of his congressional district 
koch the bronxborn son of polish immigrants had been active in 
liberal democratic politics in 1963 he defeated party boss carmine 
desapio in a race for district leader he was elected to the city 
council in 1966 and to congress from manhattans silk stocking 
district in 1968 
a 1973 campaign for mayor foundered after 45 days for lack of 
money and 1977 did not look much more encouraging he faced seven 
other candidates including the incumbent abe beame and the 
flamboyant bella abzug

issue the death penalty his ads were created by media wizard

others 
in 1981 and 1985 he would win reelection handily garnering

koch was credited with helping the city emerge from its fiscal 
crisis of the 1970s under his guidance and the stern eye of state

mayor coleman young easily outpolled 12 primary 
challengers tuesday and will seek an unprecedented fifth term in a 
november runoff against accountant tom barrow who defeated rep 
john conyers for the no 2 spot 
with 306 of 921 precincts reporting young had 31361 votes or 
48 percent to 17281 or 26 percent for barrow conyers had 
10647 or 16 percent the other 10 candidates shared the remainder 
conyers and young had been considered the challengers most likely 
to advance to the headtohead nov 7 runoff with young 
early voter turnout in the nonpartisan election was nearly twice 
as heavy as four years ago apparently reflecting the lively 
campaigns waged by some of youngs opponents 
election officials predicted that slightly more than 30 percent 
of the citys 507000 registered voters would vote in the nations 
sixthlargest city 
young 71 didnt vote tuesday having already cast an absentee 
ballot under an option available to senior citizens conyers and 
barrow each had an entourage of supporters in tow when they cast

young detroits first black mayor largely steered clear of his 
opponents during the primary campaign barrow and conyers said hed 
been in office too long and favored downtown development ahead of 
neighborhood services 
young rarely returned fire instead he used some of his 
estimated 5 million in campaign funds for television and radio 
commercials focusing on his 15 years in office actor james earl 
jones narrated several ads over a background of soft blues music 
neither of the citys two major daily newspapers endorsed the 
mayor the detroit news endorsed barrow and the detroit free press 
supported conyers each charged that young had led a closed 
administration and said the mayors office needed a change 
young seemingly anticipated the attacks when he announced his 
bid for a fifth term in may the mayor said his principal opponent 
was the news media which he said had been out to get him for years 
his anger was especially piqued by frontpage headlines about a 
paternity lawsuit filed against him by a former city employee young 
at first denied and then admitted that he was the father of the 
womans 6yearold child

political newcomer mike dow unseated mayor 
arthur outlaw in a bitter mayoral runoff in alabamas secondlargest 
city 
with all votes counted tuesday night dow had 30444 votes or 56 
percent to 23715 or 44 percent for outlaw who is chairman of 
the state republican party in the nonpartisan race 
what i hope we can accomplish is to keep the people of mobile 
this excited about this city dow 42 told several hundred 
cheering supporters in his victory speech 
in conceding outlaw a 63yearold executive told supporters 
im not happy about it and im not going to lie to you about 
that 
dow who did not declare a party affiliation had challenged 
outlaws leadership particularly his drive for a proposed 40 
million waterfront convention center without first seeking voter 
approval 
although the race was described as nonpartisan some viewed it 
as an early test of republican gov guy hunts strength for a 1990 
reelection the mobile area went heavily for hunt in 1986 and is 
considered gop territory some of dows key supporters were aligned 
with attorney general don siegelman who is considered one of hunts 
potential democratic opponents 
in the aug 22 general election 42272 voters cast ballots for 
seven candidates giving dow a 1000vote edge over outlaw and 
forcing the runoff

the judge weighing an unprecedented 
divorce custody case over seven frozen embryos is getting plenty of 
unsolicited advice including holding a lottery for the eggs 
cards and letters from selfproclaimed prophets and from a woman 
identifying herself the queen of the south among others have 
offered suggestions to circuit judge w dale young on how he might 
rule 
the right answer is somewhere in there im sure said young 
who intends to announce his decision sept 21 in the court battle 
between junior lewis davis and his estranged wife mary sue davis 
over the fertilized eggs 
young said his ruling will be based strictly on the evidence he 
heard in his maryville courtroom in august and from documents 
submitted in the case 
the cards and letters nevertheless have offered him some welcome 
relief from writing the decision he said 
the woman who dubbed herself a queen predicted in her letter to 
young you will find for man she added a egg is a egg until 
it is hatched 
although the case has stirred debate among medical and legal 
professionals a man from albuquerque nm thinks the outcome 
could be simple and logical 
he said the judge should bring the parties into court and hold a 
lottery deciding by a coin toss whether junior davis or mary sue 
davis would get the first chance to dra numbered pingpong balls 
corresponding to each of the eggs from a large glass jar 
do not try to define the meaning of life the man said in 
suggesting young limit his decision to one doublespaced page if 
you try there will be confusion and chaos 
another writer recommended the couple divide the eggs between 
them and let god decide if the eggs she gets become fertile and 
she produces an offspring 
a person describing himself as a street preacher sent young 
several postcards urging the judge to make the eggs wards of the 
state 
meanwhile a nurse from india living in new york city pleaded 
with young to give her the eggs if he decided mrs davis could not 
have them i need those desperately as i want to be a mother 
the woman wrote 
young also has received a gift of empathy from maryville native 
fred profitt a jar of caviar 
profitt said he wanted young to have some uncontested eggs

manhattan borough president david dinkins toppled 
threeterm mayor edward i koch in a democratic primary tuesday 
taking a major step toward becoming the first black mayor of 
americas largest city 
in the republican race former federal prosecutor rudolph 
giuliani overwhelmed cosmetics heir ronald lauder 
with all 5244 precincts reporting dinkins the manhattan 
borough president had 537313 votes or 51 percent to 445816 or 
42 percent for koch who lost his bid for an unprecedented fourth 
term 
he won the race and he won it fairly squarely koch said in 
his concession speech shortly after 1115 pm 
the other two democratic candidates former transit chief richard 
ravitch and comptroller harrison goldin trailed far behind with 
48289 votes or 4 percent and 28790 votes or 3 percent 
respectively 
three television stations citing exit polls had projected 
dinkins would win wcbstv said dinkins was winning 97 percent of 
the black vote and as much as 33 percent of the white vote 
giuliani had 75720 votes or 67 percent to 36905 or 33 
percent for lauder 
the former us attorney claimed victory and told cheering 
supporters i intend to go on and win in november 
giuliani was popular as a prosecutor and strategists said he 
could mount a serious challenge in the nov 7 general election 
despite a 51 democratic edge in voter enrollment 
lauder spent a record 12 million on the race most of it his own 
money and much of it for negative television ads 
dinkins 62 and koch 64 coaxed voters to the polls earlier in 
the day 
come out and vote koch said at city hall theres only one 
election and thats the democratic primary he said referring to 
the conventional wisdom that the primary winner usually wins in 
november 
dinkins jokingly politicked for his last vote as his wife stepped 
into the voting booth at their manhattan apartment building 
joyce dont forget he said you promised to vote for me 
voters cast ballots in dozens of other races including the 
citywide post of comptroller city council seats and judgeships

the democratic race was largely a referendum on koch the 
ebullient and outspoken mayor who has dominated city politics for 
more than a decade first elected in 1977 he won reelection by 
enormous margins in 1981 and 1985 
koch quickly rose to national prominence his brash manner 
personifying the quintessential new yorker but corruption scandals 
erupted in his third term crime crack and homelessness soared and 
his popularity dived 
kochs backing rose during the summer partly because of an 
aggressive television advertising campaign focusing on his 
experience and partly as voters considered and rejected alternative 
choices particularly goldin 
yet dinkins support held steady formal deliberate and 
understated he campaigned as the candidate who could heal new 
yorks social divisions schisms that koch often was accused of 
worsening 
dinkins message gained sudden currency late in the campaign 
when the slaying of a black teenager by a white gang in brooklyn 
worsened simmering racial tensions 
dinkins repeatedly said the killing had exposed an undercurrent 
of hatred that had gone unaddressed during the koch years in 
addition koch was criticized for suggesting that marches protesting 
the killing could make things worse 
the issue appeared to energize dinkins supporters especially in 
the black community so did appearances for dinkins late in the 
campaign by jesse jackson whom koch opposed in last years 
democratic presidential primary dinkins also had help from the 
citys largest unions 
ravitch 56 and goldin 53 were unable to catch voters 
imagination and languished far back in the polls throughout the 
campaign 
in the gop race lauder never showed substantial support in the 
polls but he attacked relentlessly producing a barrage of 
television ads suggesting giuliani was too liberal 
giuliani focused on the democrats particularly koch and on 
crime saying he was best equipped to make the streets safe again 
he gained fame as us attorney in manhattan from 1983 until 
january leading highprofile prosecutions of corrupt municipal 
officials mafiosi and wall street cheats 
but giuliani who never has held elective office was a stumbling 
campaigner in the summer

federal agents made the largest cocaine seizure 
since president bush announced his crackdown on drug trafficking 
capturing 2700 pound of cocaine a freighter and four other boats 
the seizure capped a oneyear undercover investigation that 
tracked a shipment of cocaine from aruba to the bahamas 
near the bahamas a us coast guard jet spotted the freighter 
and a patrol boat fired dozens of warning shots to capture a 
speedboat the us drug enforcement administration announced 
tuesday 
this is a textbook example of what the taxpayers can expect 
from a coordinated drug enforcement effort said tom cash special 
agent in charge of miamis dea office 
officials from the coast guard dea the customs service and 
local police participated in the bust which netted 17 suspects and 
cocaine with an estimated street value of 50 million 
the cocaine is believed to have originated in medellin colombia 
it was loaded onto the freighter nerma on aruba an isalnd off 
northern venezuela officials said 
the drug organization supervising the smuggling was based in 
miami and had been under investigation for a year officials said 
more arrests were expected 
the 236foot freighter the mother ship of the operation was 
spotted saturday night near the bahamas by a coast guard 
surveillance airplane authorities said 
early sunday customs and coast guard officers saw four 
speedboats approach the nerma as the freighters crew prepared to 
unload bales and barrels of cocaine authorities said 
after the speedboats met up with a 42foot fishing boat a coast 
guard patrol boat chased one of the speedboats for 22 minutes and 
fired 43 warning shots to stop the boat 
on monday morning authorities seized the nerma and two other 
speedboats and recovered a total of 1172 pounds of cocaine 
authorities said fifteen bales of cocaine were floating in the 
water near the nerma 
an additional 1540 pounds was confiscated when the fishing boat 
the jj lorick was seized late monday at a marina on the miami 
river authorities said 
dea officials believe the cocaine was already in the pipeline 
to this country before the aug 18 assasination of colombian 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan which prompted a drug 
crackdown in the south american country bush announced his battle 
against drugs sept 5 
cash said the bust is indicative of the magnitude of the 
pipeline 
the nermas seven danish crew members were arrested and ordered 
held without bond monday 
six other men were arrested aboard the three captured speedboats 
and four more were arrested near the lorick including one man 
suspected of being the owner of the freighter cash said 
six of the defendants appeared before a us magistrate one was 
ordered held on 200000 bond and two were held on 75000 bond the 
others were ordered held in pretrial detention 
all 17 defendants face federal charges of possession of cocaine

one of chinas most wanted dissident 
intellectuals the author of the controversial river elegy 
television series has escaped china and says the many people who 
aided him are all in extreme danger 
ive been living in terror for the past 100 days journalist 
su xiaokang said in an interview 100 days after chinese troops 
opened fire on unarmed citizens in beijing crushing a movement for 
freedom 
a lot of my friends have been arrested a lot i havent seen 
my wife or my little boy since the massacre the pressure on me has 
been intense 
su said he left china about 10 days ago with several other 
dissidents also wanted by the beijing government 
his escape contradicts recent reports in chineselanguage 
newspapers that the underground railroad to help dissidents and 
students has been cut 
one activist who helped arrange sus flight said chinese security 
forces have not been able to shut the operation down 
so far the activist said more than 55 dissidents and student 
participants in the movement for freedom have fled china among them 
student leader wuer kaixi political scientist yan jiaqi and 
marxist theoretician su shaozhi 
most have either gone or intend to go on the united states or to 
france where su went today some are waiting in hong kong for 
travel papers 
still chinese authorities have been successful at crushing 
several other smaller railroads run by hong kongbased 
activists and students arresting several chinese student leaders 
and people helping them escape 
in the interview tuesday su declined to reveal details of his 
flight to freedom i was helped by many many people and they are 
all in extreme danger suffice it to say i was trembling every 
day 
my nerves are frayed completely its hard going underground 
in a country like china i felt like there were eyes watching me 
everywhere he added people are afraid now everywhere 
su was active in the beijing prodemocracy movement on may 14 a 
day after a hunger strike began on tiananmen square he and 11 other 
wellknown liberal intellectuals including journalist dai qing who 
has since been arrested went to the vast expanse to plead with the 
students to leave 
we love you he shouted to the crowd of more than 100000 
people the chinese government in incompetent and it cannot stop 
the tide of history 
since the crackdown sus works have frequently been criticized 
in the staterun press because they allegedly supported the cause of 
purged communist party boss zhao ziyang who fell from power for 
supporting the student movement sus writings have been banned in 
china 
along with wuer kaixi su is by far the widest known escapee 
his sixpart river elegy television series was shown twice in 
china in 1988 reaching hundreds of millions of homes 
the series criticized the chinese peoples fear of authority 
as it described the yellow river which has changed course many 
times in its history killing millions of people the program 
questioned communist chinas turbulent history which has itself left 
millions dead 
the program marked the beginning of an almost yearlong thaw in 
the arts and political debate that thaw was frozen over in june 
when troops invaded beijing killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
since the crackdown began river elegy has been subjected to 
a scathing series of attacks the most recent of which was published 
tuesday 
an editorial in the guangming daily in august said river elegy 
tries to obliterate in one stroke 5000 years of chinese 
civilization 
in a prescient essay written for the may issue of wenhui monthly 
su asked why is it in china the losers of a political struggle 
are always killed or meet some other such horrible fate what is it 
about our system that creates this kind of misery 
in another work su wrote a fictionalized account of an important 
communist party meeting in 1958 giving chinese their first look 
behind the scenes at the machinations of power in beijing 
in the interview su said he still had hopes for his country but 
he did not feel confident about making predictions 
i am very confused right now he said ive been 
underground for 100 days and really dont know what is going on in 
china i want to go to france and talk with some friends to get a 
better understanding 
intellectual dissidents chen yizi and yan jiaqi both of whom 
escaped by the underground railroad are based in paris they 
and others have formed several groups to push for democracy in 
china sus participation will add a calm studied voice to the 
movement

the house stretches the length of a 
football field 14778 square feet of generationold controversy 
that covers an ozarks mountaintop like its former baron once 
dominated arkansas politics 
it is the house that orval built and sold for 318000 this 
year 
and now the harrington del couple who bought it have borrowed 
some memorabilia from orval e faubus six gubernatorial terms 
added their own antiques and are planning to develop the 65acre 
property 
faubus 79 tried a decade ago to persuade the state to buy the 
house as a promotional booklet refers to the woodandstone 
edifice on governors hill east of town as a historic site 
upkeep taxes and debt service had been a financial drain for 
years 
i would have been pleased to spend the rest of my life in the 
house but that was not to be said faubus who lives in conway 
with his third wife jan 
faubus said he had 1867897 left from the sale after paying 
banks in little rock jonesboro and huntsville and the balance on 
two cars 
my finances and obligations were in thousands instead of 
millions but they are satisfied faubus said and i can put on 
my tombstone his debts were paid 
faubus moved into the house in july 1967 
construction and controversy started in 1965 a year into faubus 
final twoyear term 
with faubus 10000 annual salary critics asked how could he 
afford such palatial digs 
it was not terribly complicated recalls james o powell who 
spent 25 years directing the arkansas gazettes editorials it was 
done by a lot of gifts from a great range of friends of his 
there was an open solicitation for funds as i recall we 
referred to them as love gifts they were large gifts from people 
he had done a lot of favors for and at the time he was still in a 
position to do more favors for them 
faubus said it it was built by contributions from friends as he 
was leaving office 
some charged the houses cost would soar to hundreds of thousands 
of dollars the new owners say one estimate was 35 million 
it was just the baldest kind of conflict of interest to be a 
governor in office and receiving gifts huge gifts for the 
construction of a house powell said 
ken and lorraine howell who bought the house said they know 
little about faubus administration best known for using the 
arkansas national guard to block nine black students from entering 
allwhite little rock central high school in 1957 president 
eisenhower ordered soldiers into little rock the first time federal 
troops were used to enforce desegregation orders 
we cant defend his politics or that sort of thing because we 
werent there said mrs howell 32 i know him as a nice 
honest decent person 
about their new purchase 46yearold ken howell said i 
understand it was always a controversial home and at times we have 
had people come in and say boy i see where my tax money went now 
but on the other hand i have had the opportunity to meet a lot 
of folks who say i donated 2500 or i donated 10000 and 
one of the fellows who told me he donated the native stone for the 
chimney 
faubus laughs at the suggestion that tax dollars were mingled 
with donations to build the house when you are a public figure 
you have to endure a lot he said 
the howells have a neon open sign in a front window and have 
held weddings a 50th anniversary party and played host to several 
hundred guests since they took over feb 12 
guests may view faubus gubernatorial desk customized chief 
executives license plates and scores of plaques and campaign 
materials an enlarged blackandwhite campaign photograph of faubus 
awaits mounting over a fireplace 
forty acres are being sold for development howell said 
negotiations are under way with investors who want to build a hotel 
on a concrete foundation laid years ago on the remaining 25 acres 
he said 
i would say the home is one of the most wellknown homes in the 
country howell said and governor faubus told me it always has 
been and always will be a very controversial place 
but that does not take away from how i feel about the place 
its one of a kind

a federal judge promised a quick decision on 
whether to release up to 500 misdemeanor offenders from an 
overcrowded jail where a mysterious bacterial infection has killed 
two prisoners 
mark canfield chief of epidemiology for the harris county health 
department said tuesday that the source of an outbreak of flulike 
symptoms at the county jail was unknown 
we can expect to be working on it throughout the week we have 
a lot of variables involved he said 
on monday attorney james oitzinger asked us district judge 
james deanda to force jail officials to relieve overcrowding and to 
isolate those at greatest risk of contracting the infection 
oitzinger is representing the prisoners in a continuing lawsuit 
before deanda over jail crowding 
deanda citing the seriousness of the situation heard evidence 
tuesday and said he would respond to the request as early as today 
late last week the infection killed inmates ricky labreck 30 
and rene antonio fuentes 21 both had had their spleens removed 
leaving them more susceptible to the infection doctors said 
eighteen inmates including the two who died have been treated 
at a hospital and cultures have indicated the presence of the 
pneumococcus bacteria in five canfield said one hospitalized 
inmate also is without a spleen he said 
the others have various flulike symptoms that may be early signs 
of the infection or perhaps just effects of a virus said nora 
shire a spokeswoman for ben taub hospital 
between 20 and 30 prisoners were being evaluated at the jail 
infirmary with similar flulike symptoms canfield said 
sheriff johnny klevenhagen testified tuesday that experts from 
the us centers for disease control in atlanta and those from the 
county city and jail do not blame crowding for the deaths 
klevenhagen opposes the early releases of the misdemeanor 
offenders from the jail which was designed to house 4200 inmates 
but has about 8300 
jail officials voluntarily canceled religious services 
recreational activities and classes and the medical staff screened 
inmates for conditions that could put them at greater risk than 
healthy people from bacteria

the alexandrov red army song and dance ensemble 
put together a program clearly intended to win americans audiences 
it starts with the the star spangled banner and ends with god 
bless america and in between are not only russian folk songs but 
other internationalisms including a soloist who sounds like an irish 
tenor 
the company opened tuesday night for eight performances at the 
city center next it goes to 29 other american cities 
the troupe has swashbuckling dancers men and women in 
colorful folk costumes crowded behind the dancing space the 
orchestra has russian instruments including balalaika and dombra 
and western symphony instruments 
most impressive of all to this member of the audience was the 
male chorus of more than 80 voices members of the chorus stood on 
four rows of risers at the back of the stage their prominent sound 
was baritone when they hummed in harmony it was glorious 
soloists were tenors and baritones the russian deep bass voice 
as rich as fertile black soil that americans know from opera was 
not to be heard 
but barseg tumanyan a rich baritone saved the bass lovers from 
disappointment he sang the toreador song in french and i got 
plenty of nothin in english he obviously had learned that one 
from a recording every time he sang no use complaining the 
words had an italian accent he got so much applause that he sang 
i got plenty of nothin a second time 
a trumpet soloist revealed that hed been listening to recordings 
by louis armstrong 
these dancers did the kind of things other russian troupes do but 
their impact was heightened by musical numbers between their dances 
they did choreographed swordfights danced smoothly and fast in 
lines danced in a crouch did onehand cartwheels and did some 
storytelling dances with villagers and comic characters 
lighting was interesting giving rows of men in uniform some 
variety as only shoulders were lighted and shadows made hats 
suddenly look like ancient roman helmets 
alexander alexandrov founded the ensemble in 1928 the group 
started for the united states in 1939 but world war ii broke out and 
the troupe turned back 
this is its first american tour 
capturing the tone of the program on the back wall of the stage 
at city center were huge flags of the united states and soviet 
union side by side

trounced seven other candidates tuesday to win the seat given up by 
former house democratic whip tony coelho who resigned under an 
ethics cloud 
with 323 of 397 precincts counted condit had 46420 votes or 56 
percent to 27131 or 34 percent for republican former state 
agriculture director clare berryhill five other republicans and a 
libertarian divided the remaining vote in the special election for 
the san joaquin valleys 15th district 
condits majority enabled him to avoid a nov 7 runoff with 
berryhill under state law all candidates appear on the same 
primary ballot allowing voters to cross party lines 
condit will serve the remainder of coelhos term which expires 
in 1990 
condit 41 is from modesto while berryhill 63 is from ceres 
the other candidates were republican contractor cliff burris of

coelho once a rising star in the democratic party resigned june 
15 after failing to report a 50000 loan from a savings and loan 
he said there was nothing wrong with the loan and said it wasnt 
reported because of a clerical error 
but the incident drew greater attention because it coincided with 
the downfall of house speaker jim wright dtexas coelho said he 
resigned because he didnt want to give the republicans two 
prominent targets 
despite the circumstances surrounding coelhos resignation 
condit stressed his ties to the former house whip in television 
commercials and mailings 
abortion highway congestion and agriculture problems were major 
issues in the race 
berryhill said he opposed abortion except in cases involving 
rape incest and a threat to the life of a mother condit said he 
also opposed abortion but felt the decision to have one should be 
personal

the great plains are agriculturally obsolete 
and bound to revert to the tall grasses and the buffalo claim two 
researchers the only question left they say is whether the 
transformation will be eased by government or imposed by brute 
market forces 
frank j popper and deborah epstein popper he heads the urban 
affairs department at rutgers the state university of new jersey 
and she teaches geography there believe that about one more 
generation can support itself by farming on the great plains before 
vast stretches of 10 states are simply abandoned 
as might be imagined their view is none too welcome in the area 
the nuttiest ideas never seem to die is what a fargo nd 
forum editorial said 
but the poppers insist it was a mistake to break the sod in the 
first place a historic error fostered by the 1862 homestead act 
which gave 160 acres to anyone willing to settle the land and stay 
five years 
the poppers first spelled out their idea in an article in 
planning magazine published by the american planning association 
and elaborated on it in telephone interviews 
they wrote 
we believe that over the next generation the plains will as a 
result of the largest longestrunning agricultural and 
environmental miscalculation in america become almost totally 
depopulated 
they described the area from the 98th meridian west to the 
rockies as endlessly windswept nearly treeless semiarid 
austerely beautiful historically untenable increasingly empty and 
now facing ecological devastation 
ultimately they predict about a third to half the land of the 
10 states most of the dakotas the western twothirds of nebraska 
the western halves of kansas oklahoma and texas the eastern tips 
of new mexico and colorado eastern wyoming and all but westernmost 
montana will return to its prewhite condition 
they figure the process will take 20 to 30 years 
service center cities such as bismarck nd and cheyenne 
wyo or towns near interstate highways might stay in business so 
would a few locales able to sustain themselves through agriculture 
energy development or tourism the poppers say 
only government subsidies make farming viable now and the 
subsidies are bound to vanish in an era of budget deficits and farm 
surpluses they say 
they propose having the government gradually buy back farmland 
and tear down the fences replant the shortgrass and restock the 
animals including many bison creating what we would call the 
buffalo commons 
although theyve met with hostility from the plains some find 
truth in what they say 
i agree with frank that it was a miscalculation when the social 
engineers put as many people as they did out here through that 
homestead act says rancher jim strain of rapid city sd who 
runs the american cowmans association 
i think it was meant to be a vast grasslands for producers of 
redmeat animals to graze their herds on it was a mistake to plow 
this land with its limited topsoil and limited moisture 
and geographer bret wallach of the university of oklahoma said 
the poppers are a bit quixotic in the short term but in the long 
run it is an idea whose time will probably come 
countries in the third world are going to be able to take care 
of themselves one of these days he says farm productivity will 
keep increasing and markets wont grow indefinitely and so you have 
a question of more and more surplus land in new england they let 
the farmland grow back into trees and maybe that is the enlightened 
thing to do restore it to its virgin use 
but rep pat roberts a republican who represents most of west 
kansas says hes heard it all before 
every time the region goes through a period of hard times like 
the recent drought he says you get another think tank effort to 
send us back to the buffalo 
told that the poppers express great affection for the plains 
roberts hoots thats damn nice of them

the 1989 corn crop has been battered here and 
there by dry weather too much rain and other ailments but the 
agriculture department says its fit compared with last years 
droughtpummeled contender 
according to usdas latest estimate announced tuesday farmers 
have begun to harvest an estimated 732 billion bushels of corn up 
49 percent from last years output of 492 billion bushels 
even so the new estimate based on sept 1 field surveys was 
down fractionally from the 735 billion bushels indicated a month 
ago 
at the end of august crop development was lagging behind 
normal in most of the 17 major producing states the report said 
harvest of corn for grain is well under way in the southern 
states but progress is slightly behind normal 
corn yields were estimated at 1124 bushels per acre harvested 
up from 846 bushels in 1988 but well below the record of 1194 
bushels per acre in 1987 yields were forecast in august at 1128 
bushels per acre 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop it is an essential ingredient for the production of meat 
poultry and dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 41 percent in 
1988 are expected to increase 5 percent to 7 percent this year 
according to usda economists 
soybean production was estimated at 189 billion bushels up 23 
percent from last years harvest of 154 billion bushels but that 
was down 1 percent from 191 billion bushels indicated last month 
yields were estimated at an average of 32 bushels per acre this 
year compared with 268 bushels in 1988 and the august forecast of 
323 bushels the record was 341 bushels per acre in 1985 
although the usdas soybean estimate was close to what private 
grain traders had expected the corn figure was slightly higher than 
some had counted on 
the revised estimates showed total wheat production at 206 
billion bushels up 14 percent from last year and 1 percent more 
than the 204 billion bushels forecast in august 
wheat yields were estimated to average 329 bushels per harvested 
acre compared with 341 bushels in 1988 and the august forecast of 
326 bushels the record was 394 bushels in 1983 
there was no new estimate for winter wheat production which 
accounts for about threefourths of the total previously usda put 
the 1989 harvest at about 147 billion bushels down 6 percent from 
last year 
production of durum wheat which is planted in the spring was 
indicated at 936 million bushels up 109 percent from last years 
droughtravaged harvest and up 3 percent from the august estimate 
other spring wheat was shown at 505 million bushels up 146 
percent from the 1988 harvest and 4 percent more than estimated in 
august 
cotton production was estimated at 123 million bales down 20 
percent from 1988 but up from the august forecast of 118 million 
bales 
in a related report on the worlds supply and demand situation 
for major commodities analysts said total corn use in the 198990 
marketing year that began on sept 1 is still expected to be around 
75 billion bushels including domestic and export requirements 
with demand exceeding 1989 corn production that will mean 
another drawdown of us stockpiles to about 168 billion bushels 
left over by next sept 1 down from current inventories estimated 
at 186 billion bushels 
the report said corn prices may average in the range of 185 to 
225 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year down from 255 last 
season that was only a slight change from the august forecast 
other 1989 crop estimates based on sept 1 indications compared 
with 1988 output included 
sorghum 6589 million bushels and an average yield of 626 
bushels per acre compared with 5776 million and 638 in 1988 
barley 4011 million bushels and a yield of 469 bushels per 
acre compared with 2905 million and 386 
rice 1523 million hundredweight and a yield of 5548 pounds 
per acre compared with 1595 million and 5511 
peanuts 444 billion pounds and a yield of 2688 pounds per 
acre compared with 398 billion and 2445 
tobacco 149 billion pounds and a yield of 2130 pounds per 
acre compared with 137 billion and 2160 
sugarbeets 265 million tons and a yield of 20 tons per acre 
compared with 248 million and 191 
sugarcane 308 million tons and a yield of 357 tons per acre

the soviet union should be brought to western 
ways through membership in the international monetary fund two 
experts on international affairs proposed in a study published today 
the fund would still run the risk that soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev could be replaced by hard liners but since the 
soviet union would at most be granted 5 to 6 percent of the votes on 
the imf executive board any disruptive tactics could be 
contained wrote catherine gwin and richard e feinberg 
nearly all of the imfs member governments are devoted to private 
enterprise although china hungary poland and yugoslavia belong 
the soviet union does not the united states has the largest block 
of votes with 1914 percent 
gwin is special program adviser at the rockefeller foundation 
feinberg a former member of the state department policy planning 
staff is executive vice president of the overseas development 
council a private group financed largely by foundations 
their volume is called the international monetary fund in a 
multipolar world pulling together 
the imf provides loans and other assistance to developing nations 
gorbachev has expressed interest in joining the fund but the 
us government has opposed the idea 
the authors suggested the soviets could get advice from the fund 
as china has done from the imfs sister organization the world 
bank membership in the fund is a condition for joining the bank and 
the two organizations have the same 151 member countries 
the authors said the soviets need guidance on money banking 
price reform and exchange and trade relations 
as confidencebuilding measures they recommended 
consultations among officials of the fund and the soviet union 
provision by the soviets of data on their aid to the third world 
soviet cofinancing of some world bank aid projects 
cooperation with the world bank in some areas such as protection 
of the environment 
integrating the soviets into the world economy could give the 
fund a central purpose for the 1990s the writers suggested 
the imf has been a failure in the past decade according to 
another writer in the volume jeffrey d sachs professor of 
international trade at harvard university 
sachs said few of the 39 developing nations the fund has tried to 
help this decade have become able to meet their international 
obligations without undermining their internal economies 
most of the problem debtor countries are further away than ever 
from renewed creditworthiness 
a fund official said there would be no immediate comment from 
fund managing director michel camdessus

bush administration blueprints for fighting the 
drug war are coming under fire from state and local officials who 
say the battle would strain their budgets without providing the 
money to get the job done 
almost everyone acknowledges that this is not enough money 
mayor joseph p riley of charleston sc told a senate judiciary 
committee hearing tuesday on how the drug plan will affect state and 
local budgets 
riley praised president bush and national drug policy director 
william bennett for addressing the problem but he said the 350 
million the strategy envisions sending to state and local 
governments to bolster law enforcement would be less than 1 percent 
of what they already spend 
he said there could be a net loss when aid to state and local 
governments under the plan is balanced against cuts in federal 
grants for juvenile justice programs community development and 
housing 
officials appearing as witnesses were virtually unanimous in 
saying federal aid under the proposal was insufficient several 
complained cuts in existing grant programs could actually harm 
efforts to solve the drug problem 
it is inconceivable that we would go out to fight a war with 8 
billion to solve a problem that we conservatively estimate at 120 
billion said john gustafson president of the national 
association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors you cant 
do it with an 8 percent solution 
judiciary chairman joseph biden ddel said he didnt want to 
go back to his constituents after passing the measure only to be 
told you made life worse for us because you increased my taxes or 
you didnt increase my taxes but i dont have any bus service 
anymore 
state rep dan blue of north carolina chairman of the law and 
justice committee of the national conference of state legislatures 
said states were pleased that the national government is joining 
our efforts to eradicate drug abuse 
unfortunately development of the national strategy did not 
include a sufficient analysis of the potential costs to state and 
local governments he said 
one administration proposal criticized by the officials would 
require drug testing of all people arrested prisoners parolees and 
those released on bond while awaiting trial 
biden said that would cost 244 million of the 350 million in 
law enforcement aid

critics are questioning whether the energy 
department is withholding information about the reason for closing a 
recentlycompleted top secret military plant while keeping a 
34yearold twin in operation 
rep butler derrick dsc in a letter to energy secretary 
james d watkins on tuesday wondered about the truth of the 
departments announcement last week that it was putting the fuel 
materials facility on backup status for economic reasons 
if this announcement raises questions in my mind it 
practically begs the media and congressional oversight committees to 
maul the department of energy again derrick wrote adding he 
wanted a full explanation from watkins 
as you know speculation has it that the savannah river site 
naval fuel production facility has experienced operational 
difficulties resulting from design flaws he wrote 
the facility part of the 300squaremile savannah river site 
nuclear weapons complex near aiken sc is one of two plants 
producing uranium fuel for naval reactors derrick said the 
mothballed plant was completed at a cost of 175 million 
the department said it was halting production at the facility 
because the projected demand for fuel no longer justifies the cost 
of operating two facilities 
the other production site is at erwin tenn and is run by 
nuclear fuel services inc the department said that facility can 
meet all naval fuel production needs and is the only manufacturing 
site qualified to make all types of fuel for the navy 
derrick said available evidence did not seem to support the 
economic explanation since the erwin facility is 34 years old and 
has suffered operational problems whereas the south carolina 
facility is new 
derrick gave no details of the operational problems at the erwin 
facility except to say it has had problems keeping track of 
uranium inventories among other difficulties 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary told the associated 
press he was not able to comment immediately because he had not been 
fully briefed on the situation he added he was not aware of any 
operational problems at the south carolina site 
moore said sen strom thurmond rsc had also objected to the 
shutdown decision 
in a telephone interview derrick offered no evidence of 
operational problems at the savannah river facility saying its 
my own speculation he noted the energy department as a matter of 
policy has declined to publicly discuss the naval fuel facilitys 
operational record and its specific functions 
some environmental groups also have questioned the shutdown 
decision dan reicher a lawyer with the natural resources defense 
council said after last weeks energy department announcement that 
he found it curious the older erwin facility would be kept open 
instead of the newer plant 
in a related matter watkins came under fire again tuesday from 
environmental groups for his decision to hire victor stello a 
nuclear regulatory commission executive to run the departments 
nuclear weapons program 
four groups greenpeace usa the ralph naderfounded public 
citizen the government accountability project and the environmental 
policy institutefriends of the earth released copies of a report 
they termed an indictment of stellos tenure at the nrc which 
regulates the civilian nuclear industry 
the report listed several previously documented incidents in 
which some critics of stello have raised questions about his 
commitment to nuclear safety 
senate committee hearings on the stello nomination are expected 
to start in october

there are places like villanova where all or 
practically all of the scholarship basketball players leave with 
degrees in their pockets after four or five years 
but villanova is an exception 
at many other schools less proud to step forward and be counted 
publicly hardly any of the players in highdollar major sports 
programs such as football and basketball get their degrees 
national collegiate athletic association figures for 1988 show 30 
schools had graduation rates of 5 percent or less for basketball 
players and seven with rates of 96 percent or greater 
most of the associations 800 member schools fall somewhere in 
between 
that wide disparity would not disappear under sen bill bradleys 
plan to force all colleges to make public the graduation statistics 
they already compile and report privately to the ncaa which 
compiles them in an annual composite report 
it doesnt guarantee that studentathletes are going to make 
it said bradley dnj who was a rhodes scholar and 
professional basketball star before taking up politics education 
requires hard work 
but bradley insisted his consumer disclosure legislation 
would help youngsters interested in getting an education find the 
right place to play ball 
dr patricia lucas principal of southeast high school in 
bradenton fla and a spokeswoman for the national association of 
secondary school principals strongly agreed during a hearing before 
the senate labor and human resources committee 
she said legislation would help those whose maturity has not 
progressed beyond the stage of dreaming of the glory of college and 
professional sports 
the bradley bill would require the individual figures be reported 
to the us department of education broken down by sport each 
institution would have to disclose its rates to prospective athletic 
recruits and the figures would be printed on any scholarship papers 
signed by the student 
the head of the ncaa and a college president pleaded for more 
time before the federal government steps in with a law at least 
until the ncaa meeting in january 
if we dont pass meaningful legislation i will personally 
lobby for this bill ncaa executive director dick schultz said 
he argued the 48 percent graduate rate for college athletes at 
ncaa member institutions is actually slightly better than the rate 
for general student bodies and he said academic rules for athletes 
put into place over the past five years have not had time to show up 
in statistics 
but bradley said the ncaa was offering too little too late 
and told reporters he intended to press for passage of his bill 
before the january ncaa meeting bradley introduced similar 
legislation last year but didnt push it 
those testifying in favor of the bill included villanova 
basketball coach rollie massimino whose team is a perennial power 
and has won one national championship 
massimino told the committee that which the exception of some 
who transferred to other schools or otherwise left villanova in good 
academic standing all 52 of his player got their degrees 
it wasnt always easy he said especially in the early part of 
his 17year tenure before his reputation was established and 
everyone realized he was serious about emphasizing academics he 
said he suffered under the pressure to win before he told himself 
were either going to do it or were not and were going to do it 
my way 
massimino said the result shows a collegiate athletic program can 
be run without losing sight of a colleges educational mission

an environmental group says the fuel lost by 
closing off parts of the outer continental shelf to oil drilling 
could be more than offset by increasing automobile mileage 
prohibiting development in the highly ecologically sensitive 
areas would not remove a significant amount of fuel from the 
market dorene bolze of the national audubon society told a house 
merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee tuesday 
the hearing came as several other subcommittees were making 
lastminute adjustments tuesday to oil spill cleanup legislation 
arising from the tanker exxon valdez accident that fouled alaskas 
prince william sound full committee and house action may occur 
later this week 
supporters of drilling say the risk from offshore drilling is far 
less than that from tankers pointing out there hasnt had a major 
spill from offshore drilling since major spills and fires in 1969 
and 1970 forced federal attention on the industry 
but opponents say there are too many environmental hazards 
associated with drilling including destruction of wetlands for 
pipelines and facilities and air and noise pollution the impact on 
domestic fuel production would be relatively small they say 
predictions are that offshore areas recommended for off limits 
contain only 10 percent of all estimated offshore and gas 
resources said bolze quoting a private study based on interior 
department data 
she said increasing the mileage standards of passenger vehicles 
to currently technically feasible levels would produce oil savings 
equal to the amount of undiscovered oil resources estimated to 
exist in the outer continental shelf 
environmentalists want to ban drilling at georges bank off new 
england the florida keys bristol bay of alaska some areas of 
northern and southern california and areas in the midatlantic 
a bush administration task force is studying some of the more 
controversial lease sales off florida and the gulf coast and is 
expected to make recommendations to president bush in december 
bolze testified at a hearing of the panama canal and outer 
continental shelf subcommittee which is examining the environmental 
impact of such drilling as a result of the valdez tanker spill 
rep jack fields rtexas said barring offshore drilling would 
put the countrys shoreline at greater environmental risk from 
increased tanker traffic particularly foreign ships 
since the average offshore well in the gulf of mexico produces 
only eight barrels of oil per hour in order to duplicate the valdez 
spill all the wells in the gulf of mexico multiplied by three would 
have to simultaneously blow out said fields 
if we dont move forward with a domestic ocs program our 
country is going to suffer in the future he said 
most ocs production is in the gulf of mexico and pacific ocean 
off california an administration task force is studying some of the 
more controversial lease sales off florida and the gulf coast of 
florida and is expected to make recommendations to president bush in 
december 
barry a williamson director of minerals management for the 
interior department said 8 billion gallons of oil and 75 trillion 
cubic feet of natural gas have been produced over the 36 years of 
ocs drilling 
he said that is about oneeighth of us oil production and 
onefourth of natural gas production

rep barney frank says hes eager to refute 
inaccurate charges about his relationship with a male prostitute 
and will fully cooperate with an ethics committee investigation into 
his conduct 
the committee on standards of official conduct the ethics 
committee voted tuesday to begin a preliminary investigation into 
the massachusetts democrats activities with prostitute steve gobie 
frank an acknowledged homosexual has said he originally hired 
gobie for sex and then employed him using personal funds as a 
personal aid from july 1985 through august 1987 
frank called the ethics panel the best possible forum to 
resolve conflicting accounts he and gobie have given on some details 
of their relationship 
gobie for instance said he operated a prostitution ring from 
franks capitol hill apartment with the lawmakers knowledge but 
frank insists he was unaware of any such activity 
according to gobie frank used his congressional immunity to void 
parking tickets incurred by gobie when the prostitute used the 
lawmakers car to keep appointments for illicit sex frank said he 
only had tickets waived when the car was used for official business 
frank said he requested the ethics investigation several weeks 
ago when i saw what i believe to be very inaccurate charges 
floating around 
and i welcome the chance to go before the ethics committee with 
canceled checks for parking tickets with the statement of my 
landlady who lived in that house on a daytoday basis with 
people on my staff who have evidence to give 
commenting after delivering a speech to a bankers group frank 
said the impact on his political future would depend on what the 
ethics committee decides frankly if some of the accusations that 
were made were true then i think i would be in very serious trouble 
and ought to be 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the 
investigation was prompted by the assertions surrounding barney 
franks employment of mr steve gobie 
the committee voted in secret and dixon would not reveal whether 
the vote was unanimous 
the vote began only the first round of the houses internal 
disciplinary process and will determine whether a more complete 
investigation is necessary the panel can issue subpoenas and take 
testimony during the preliminary stage 
the inquiry could lead to a statement of an alleged violation 
which is similar to an indictment this could result in a 
disciplinary proceeding and a recommendation to the full house for 
punishment which could range from a reprimand to expulsion 
dixon also announced the committee accepted the request of panel 
member chester atkins dmass to withdraw from consideration of 
the frank case 
mr atkins felt in this particular case he could not be a fair 
and impartial person dixon said house speaker thomas s foley 
appointed former ethics committee chairman louis stokes dohio to 
replace atkins on the frank case although atkins will remain active 
in other committee investigations 
in a statement atkins said barney frank is my friend i 
cannot end our friendship today and i cannot be sure that my 
judgment of this friend would be impartial and unbiased as the 
house rules require the public has a right to expect of us no 
outright predispositions 
atkins also said his dual role as a panel member and 
massachusetts democratic chairman would at the outset serve to 
undermine the committees standing if i remain on the committee 
for this case i compromise the process if i recuse myself i do 
much more to uphold the credibility of the process

many democrats say the supreme courts ruling 
on abortion gives them an opening in the 1989 state elections but 
strategists are cautioning the issue remains a political wildcard 
until ballot results are counted 
celinda lake a pollster for democratic candidates said tuesday 
that polling in many states suggests significant numbers of voters 
may shift to candidates supporting abortion rights 
she acknowledged however the impact of the courts decision 
this summer permitting states greater regulatory power over 
abortion has not been put to the test of a full political campaign 
i think we really dont know what happens when we come into an 
election and this issue is getting hammered on she said at a 
discussion of abortion politics sponsored by a liberal democratic 
research organization 
lake and other political analysts said abortion may prove a 
decisive issue in the governors elections this fall in virginia and 
new jersey democratic candidates in both states have staked out 
positions generally in favor of abortion rights 
a consultant the virginia democratic candidate lt gov l 
douglas wilder suggested wilder plans to launch television 
advertising focusing on the abortion issue he faces republican 
nominee j marshall coleman who has softened his opposition to 
abortion but remains perceived as the antiabortion candidate the 
analysts said 
until this year we always said this is an issue you dont want 
to pay to put on tv said frank greer a washingtonbased 
media consultant to the wilder campaign this year people are 
going to be paying and i think that will make it a cutting 
issue 
but charles cook editor of the cook political report newsletter 
and a political analyst said much of the national polling showing 
voters generally in favor of abortion is meaningless because voters 
may decide their votes on other issues 
he said democratic candidates who push proabortion positions 
risk alienating older democratic voters less educated voters and 
in many states black voters for republicans who oppose abortion 
he said to push the abortion issue forcefully is to risk losing 
younger voters and women 
from a political standpoint i think this is very very 
dangerous for the democratic party and its one that really ought to 
be thought through before there is any movement to make the 
democratic party the prochoice party and for the republican party 
for that matter to become the prolife party cook said 
the analysts commented at a luncheon sponsored by the center for 
national policy and held at the national democratic club

after months of criticizing president bushs 
proposed capital gains tax cut as a giveaway to the rich democratic 
leaders are offering an alternative for average folks a return 
to taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said allowing all workers to have iras would be a better 
way to encourage saving than the proposed capital gains cut house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash and senate majority leader george 
j mitchell dmaine said they agree 
the senate and the american people now have a clear choice 
between competing plans to advance our economy mitchell said 
tuesday 
cutting capital gains taxes is an investment incentive for a 
few but the problem is broader than that bentsen said tuesday in 
announcing his proposal with the ira wed have the participation 
of a broad spectrum of middle america 
all workers were allowed fully deductible iras before passage of 
the 1986 tax overhaul that law made them available only to workers 
not covered by a company pension and to covered workers with 
incomes under 25000 and couples under 40000 partial deductions 
are allowed couples with incomes under 50000 and single people 
under 35000 
under bentsens proposal a person could contribute up to 2000 
a year to an ira and avoid current taxation on half the sum the 
contribution and the interest earned would not be taxed until the 
money was withdrawn for retirement tuition or making the down 
payment on a first home 
this ira affects average folks bentsen said it helps 
address three of the primary concerns of middleincome americans 
lowerincome americans buying that first home financing a college 
education or providing for ones retirement 
bentsen outlined his proposal as the house ways and means 
committee struggled to solve the capital gains issue which has 
stalemated the panel for several weeks the committees 13 
republicans and six democrats a bare majority of the 37member 
panel favor a capital gains cut which bush has endorsed 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the committee chairman has 
blocked a vote on the cut although he opposes a capital gains 
reduction he is trying to develop a compromise that could win back 
one of the six dissident democrats 
the joint committee on taxation estimates that as much as 80 
percent of the benefits of the capital gains cut would go to those 
with incomes above 100000 a year 
nevertheless bush contends the cut is necessary to encourage 
saving and jobcreating investments 
economists disagree on that argument just as they disagree on 
whether iras encourage saving or simply reward those who transfer 
money from a taxable savings account into an ira 
bentsen noted a recent study commissioned by merrill lynch 
consumer markets found that 80 percent of ira contributions were new 
saving that study also found that twothirds of ira deductions were 
claimed by those with incomes under 50000 
in 1986 the last year iras were available to all workers 155 
million couples and individuals made ira contributions totaling 38 
billion a year later 74 million taxpayers claimed deductions for 
14 billion in contributions 
the ira proposal is the first effort by democrats to offer an 
alternative to the capital gains cut bush sought during his 
campaigned last year they agreed on the need to encourage saving 
but until now only argued that a capital gains cut is not the way to 
do it

the senate is sending former cia agent donald 
gregg to seoul as us ambassador to south korea dismissing months 
of attacks on his credibility and alleged involvement in the 
irancontra affair 
the senate voted 6633 on tuesday to confirm president bushs 
nomination of gregg after opponents said his sworn denials were 
absurd on their face and defenders said rejecting him would be 
unfair 
twentyone democrats joined all 45 senate republicans in voting 
for the nomination thirtythree democrats voted no 
sen charles robb dva played a key role in debate mounting a 
detailed defense of greggs conduct during the years he served as 
national security adviser to vice president bush 
robb who said he supported the nominee out of conscience and 
conviction said he would vote for gregg in the hope that we can 
put the unfortunate experience of executivelegislative distrust 
behind us and begin anew in the spirit of a sustainable bipartisan 
foreign policy 
robb said he is convinced gregg did not lie to congress the 
record shows not a crafty allknowing political operative said 
robb but rather a dedicated public servant concerned with the 
issues and setting the record straight 
when we take time to consider each concern we find an 
explanation his biggest sin seems to be that he served in 
government when our system broke down he said 
bushs nomination of gregg a former cia station chief in seoul 
has been pending since march 
in two sessions before the senate foreign relations committee 
gregg denied under oath allegations he was involved in the reagan 
administrations secret and illegal effort to resupply the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
but many of robbs democratic colleagues said greggs denials 
were just not credible 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine who was a member 
of the senate irancontra investigating committee said he believes 
greggs explanations are so inconsistent with the known facts that 
they cannot be believed 
mr gregg has clearly not been straight with us said sen 
alan cranston dcalif few who have reviewed the record have come 
away with any confidence in mr greggs veracity 
sen albert gore dtenn scoffed at greggs explanation of why 
bushs agenda for two separate meetings as vice president included 
the subject of contra resupply 
gregg testified the citations were the result of a 
misunderstanding of how the agenda topics should be listed he said 
the actual topic was copter resupply referring to the resupply 
of helicopters for the armed forces in el salvador 
are we to seriously accept a baldfaced presentation of that 
kind gore asked its absurd on its face 
to vote to confirm we have to believe this nominee did not lie 
brazenly and repeatedly gore said its a little difficult to 
swallow

the bush administration says nine states with 
some of the nations dirtiest coalburning power plants do not 
deserve financial help from other parts of the country to cut acid 
rain emissions 
william k reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency said tuesday he opposed changing the administrations clean 
air bill to provide special help to the the nine states 
he produced figures strongly contradicting the states assertion 
that they would pay a disproportionate share of costs to reduce acid 
rain 
reilly testified before the house energy and commerce energy and 
power subcommittee on the acid rain section of the bush legislation 
today the energy and commerce environment subcommittee is meeting 
to amend the bill a process that could take three weeks the 
legislation would then go to the full energy and commerce committee 
reilly said the acid rain section is fair to those who cleaned 
upin the past it doesnt make them pay to clean up again he 
said referring to electric customers from outside the nine states 
whose utility bills already include the cost of pollutioncutting 
moves by utilities in their own areas 
the administrator sparred often tuesday with rep philip r 
sharp dind chairman of the energy and power panel who insisted 
electric customers in the nine states are being asked to do more 
than our fair share 
the states are pennsylvania west virginia georgia ohio 
illinois indiana kentucky tennessee and missouri 
sharp has demanded that electric ratepayers in those states 
receive financial help in paying for power plant reductions of 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that form the compound 
known as acid rain the nine states have plants that burn high 
sulfur coal 
socalled cost sharing could be accomplished by forcing 
nonutility industries to reduce their emissions or by having 
electric ratepayers elsewhere pick up part of the tab through their 
bills 
the environment will not know where reductions come from 
but our ratepayers will know sharp said contending that some 
utility rates could rise by 20 percent in the nine states but 
reilly said the five hardesthit states would only see ratepayers 
bills increase on the average a third of a cent per 
killowatthour by the year 2001 
sharp began his hearing tuesday by citing new figures that 
contended the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77 
percent of the acid rain emissions even though they cause only 50 
percent of the problem 
he contended in the initial phase of the program ratepayers in 
the nine states would pay for fully 90 percent of the cleanup 
but reilly then presented his own statistics which said that the 
nine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but their 
actual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total 
thats as fair as we can possibly make it he said 
bushs legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airborne 
chemicals acid rain and ozone acid rain consists of sulfur dioxide 
and nitrogen oxide substances that unite in the air and travel 
hundreds of miles before falling to earth 
acid rain destroys lakes kills trees makes buildings 
deteriorate and causes lung problems 
the president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons 
by the year 2000 based on 1980 levels nine million coming from 
power plants and one million from industrial emissions already 
achieved there would be an emissions cap to prevent future 
releases from offsetting the reductions 
nitrogen oxides from utilities would be cut two million tons from 
the projected level in the year 2000 but since these oxides could 
increase by three million tons during this period there could 
actually be an increase of one million tons 
utilities could decide how to reduce their pollution with 
possibilities including switching to cleaner burning fuels 
employing existing antipollution equipment like scrubbers trying 
new methods such as developing technology for cleaner burning of 
highsulfur coal and conservation

a senate subcommittee is slashing president 
bushs budget request for the trident 2 missile because of two 
successive failures in undersea test firings of the 
submarinelaunched weapon 
it was an obvious necessity sen dale bumpers dark said 
tuesday after the decision by the senate appropriations subcommittee 
on defense you cant procure with the shape that missile is in 
without dissent the subcommittee approved a 2882 billion 
military spending bill that eliminates bushs request of 16 
billion for missile purchases in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
and 216 million for purchases further down the road 
instead the subcommittee approved 286 million for research and 
development of the missile a more lethal version of the trident 1 
which is the heart of the navys nuclear deterrent bush had asked 
for 216 million 
its time to regroup said sen ted stevens of alaska 
ranking republican on the subcommittee its a matter of caution 
the moneys there to use it to get more stability in the test 
the action comes almost one month after a trident 2 missile 
exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear submarine 
tennessee about 200 miles off the coast of florida 
at 265 million each the trident is supposed to be deployed in 
the 1990s aboard a new generation of submarines bolstering the 
seabased leg of americas land sea and air nuclear forces 
defense department spokesman pete williams asked at a pentagon 
briefing whether the navy would meet its operating date for the 
trident 2 said the service will continue to try to find out the 
cause of the recent failure of the missile 
there has been no decision to slip the initial operating 
capability date of march 1990 said williams 
the house in approving its versions of authorization and 
appropriations bills and the senate which adopted its 
authorization legislation did not alter bushs budget request for 
the missile but the two chambers took those steps before the recent 
failure of the trident 2 
house and senate conferees will begin meeting this week to hammer 
out an authorization bill the senate appropriations committee is 
expected to vote thursday on the military spending bill with full 
senate action likely next week 
in other action the subcommittee left most of bushs strategic 
programs such as the b2 stealth bomber and the mx and midgetman 
nuclear missiles relatively intact as the full senate did last 
month with the authorization bill 
the panel also approved 255 million for the marine corps to test 
the v22 osprey a verticaltakeoff plane and accepted the 
presidents decision to kill the navys f14d jet fighter 
in addition the subcommittee included 105 billion to help 
finance the war on drugs including 300 million in cash and 
equipment for the coast guard 62 million to operate surveillance 
planes and ships and 118 million for existing defense department 
education and drugtreatment programs 
bush had asked for spending of 132 million in the legislation 
the panel went slightly beyond the full senate in trimming funds 
for the star wars missile shield the senate authorization bill put 
the strategic defense initiative amount at 45 billion a cut of 
400 million from bushs budget the subcommittee cut sd research 
and development to 37 billion which when added to the 355 
million in energy department money and military construction funds 
is a total of about 41 billion 
in addition to the spending bill of 2797 billion the 
subcommittee adopted a separate 85 billion amendment that includes 
1 billion for four cargo ships and two tankers 13 billion to 
replace nuclear power reactors on the carrier enterprise 17 
billion for 174 apache helicopters and 34 billion for modernizing 
major military components such as ship radar systems 
the house last month approved a 2865 billion military 
appropriations bill that slashed nearly 2 billion for star wars 
from bushs request strictly limited the b2 bomber program and 
made drastic cuts in the mx and midgetman missiles 
defense secretary dick cheney in a recent letter to the chairmen 
of the house and senate armed services committees said he would 
recommend that bush veto any defense bill that resembles the house 
legislation

the crown prince of jordan is demanding a 
commitment from israel that it would relinquish the west bank and 
gaza in exchange for peace 
in a speech tuesday night prince hassan accused israel of trying 
to drive a wedge between palestinian arabs and the palestine 
liberation organization but he disavowed any jordanian intention to 
represent the palestinians 
at a news conference earlier hassan dismissed as a pipedream 
of some israeli politicians the idea that jordan would agree to a 
deal to resume control of the west bank 
speaking after meetings with president bush and secretary of 
state james a baker iii the prince said israel and the united 
states should accept the plo as the legitimate representative of the 
palestinians in negotiations 
he denounced israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan for 
elections among palestinians on the west bank and in gaza saying 
the purpose is to drive a wedge between them and their recognized 
leadership 
jordan controlled the west bank from 1948 until 1967 while egypt 
ran gaza the two arab countries lost the territories to israel in 
the 1967 sixday war 
shamirs plan which has us support is designed to have 
elected palestinians negotiate with israel five years of local 
selfrule for the 14 million palestinian inhabitants afterward 
joined by egypt and jordan they would negotiate an overall 
settlement 
but hassan said an agreement could only be arranged at an 
international that includes the plo and the soviet union jordan 
will not represent the palestinian people at the conference nor 
will it negotiate the settlement of the palestinian problem on 
behalf of the plo he said 
he said jordan was willing to attend as part of a mixed 
delegation with yasser arafats group in the speech and at the news 
conference he referred to the plo leader as president arafat 
earlier tuesday the state department gave cautious praise to a 
plan by egyptian president hosni mubarak for palestinian elections 
but there was no indication whether israel or the plo would go along 
the plan by president hosni mubarak includes a demand that israel 
accept the idea it should trade land for peace negotiations for an 
overall settlement of the arabisraeli dispute would be held three 
to five years after limited palestinian selfrule began 
israeli prime minister shamir has steered clear of any scheme 
that would commit israel to relinquishing west bank and gaza 
territory the plo meanwhile demands nothing less than statehood 
baker is sounding out mideast leaders about mubaraks ideas he 
met last week with israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin and on 
tuesday with hassan mubarak is expected here within a few weeks and 
shamir in november 
we continue to encourage all parties to find ways to launch an 
israelipalestinian dialogue to discuss the israeli election 
initiative said margaret tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman to the extent these 10 points can be helpful in that 
regard we welcome egypts efforts 
other elements of mubaraks proposal include permitting 
palestinians who live in east jerusalem to participate in the 
balloting and supervision of the voting by international observers 
at a news conference later hassan called mubaraks proposal 
worthwhile but said a settlement of the arabisraeli dispute 
required an international peace conference 
we see the egyptian proposals as a mechanism for holding 
elections he said 
hassan met with bush at the white house for about 15 minutes and 
told reporters they discussed generalities 
i had the very moving impression of the presidents personal 
concern toward these developments he said

the bush administration is reinforcing economic 
sanctions against panama but us officials concede the new action 
will likely fall short of toppling military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said tuesday 
panama will be ineligible to participate in an expansion of the us 
quotas for sugar imports 
in addition she said the administration is expanding the list of 
panamanian companies and individuals which americans will not have 
permission to deal with 
us officials insisting on anonymity said they doubted the new 
measures were strong enough to dislodge noriega from power 
but they said a stronger package of economic sanctions could do 
more damage to the panamanian people than to noriega who is under 
indictment on drug smuggling charges by two florida grand juries 
ms tutwiler said that without the sanction on sugar exports 
panama would have the authority to export more than 23000 tons to 
the united states under the revised quota 
the announcement did not come as a surprise since the reagan 
administration had suspended panamas sugar quota as far back as 
december 1987 
the new action reflected administration displeasure over 
noriegas decision to install a longtime associate as panamas 
unelected president two weeks ago 
the state department has accused noriega of sabotaging elections 
last may rather than recognize the victory of the opposition 
candidate

fred bush a former aide and fundraiser for 
the president will not fight for his nomination as ambassador to 
luxembourg according to an administration official 
bush who is no relation to the president faced stiff opposition 
in the senate to his nomination because of his involvement in 
allegations of influence peddling at the department of housing and 
urban development 
it became obvious it wasnt going to be worth the pain and he 
withdrew his name said the administration official who spoke 
tuesday on condition he not be named 
the official said president bush had not decided who to nominate 
in fred bushs place or whether he would offer him another job 
fred bush earned large fees as a consultant to developers who 
hired him to help win approval for projects dependent on hud grants 
after one appearance before a house subcommittee investigating 
the scandalplagued agency bush was asked to testify a second time 
to explain discrepancies that appeared later between his testimony 
and other evidence subcommittee members also were openly skeptical 
of some of bushs memory lapses when he testified 
he was an aide to george bush as vice president and chief 
fundraiser for the presidents successful 1988 campaign 
his nomination as ambassador languished for months in the senate 
before senators sent the nomination back to the white house just 
before the august recess

health experts say research on how fast the 
aids virus progresses in humans could speed testing of drugs to 
combat the disease 
such a measure will make drug development a lot faster and more 
efficient said dr samuel broder director of the national cancer 
institute and a leading aids researcher 
you might be able to make determinations much quicker without 
having to let studies go to where there is a deterioration of 
clinical status he said 
about 300 researchers from federal university and commercial 
laboratories met at the national academy of science headquarters 
tuesday to discuss what characteristics in the blood of aids 
patients could be used to gauge how fast the disease infects the 
immune system 
if an agreement is reached and approved by the food and drug 
adminstration it could lead to the use of a laboratory blood test 
that would swiftly determine progress of the aids virus infection in 
a patient experts said this would help measure the effects of 
drugs to fight the disease 
stages of infection by the human immunodeficency virus that 
causes aids are now measured by clinical effects such as 
opportunistic infections or wasting or chronic lymph node 
enlargement these are called clinical endpoints and they often 
can take months or years to develop 
a number of investigators believe the progress of aids can be 
accurately measured by testing the blood for the number of cd4 
lymphocyte cells these cells are part of the immune system and are 
the primary target of the aids virus 
normally humans have 800 or more cd4 cells per cubic millimeter 
but once the aids infection becomes active this number begins to 
drop cd4 cell counts of less than 200 are thought to reflect an 
immune system that is in serious trouble 
a number of researchers have suggested that tracking the rate of 
decline of cd4 cells would be a method of measuring the progress of 
the aids virus 
if a candidate drug caused this decline to slow stop or reverse 
the researchers believe it would suggest the drug was slowing 
progress of the aids virus 
determining the cd4 cell is a realtively simple laboratory test 
that can be quickly performed researchers said it would enable them 
to plot from weektoweek the precise progress a patient makes while 
receiving experimental therapy for aids 
but some investigators at the meeting said not all patients 
respond in the same way to infection by the aids virus some 
patients with cd4 counts well above 500 have developed opportunistic 
infections while others with much lower cd4 counts remain 
symptomfree 
a lot of people are in agreement that cd4 is an important 
prognostic factor that is it can predict how you are going to do 
over an interval of time said broder but there is still not an 
agreement as to whether you can use cd4 alone theres no consensus 
on that

the owner of the rancho seco nuclear 
power complex rejected a companys proposal to buy and restart the 
plant apparently ending the possibility that the reactor would be 
revived 
the surprise 50 vote by directors of the sacramento municipal 
utility district was led by cliff wilcox a longtime supporter of 
nuclear power and rancho seco 
wilcox gave a reluctant and emotional rejection of the proposal 
from quadrex corp a campbellbased energy engineering company 
in my estimation its not a deal that can fly wilcox said 
he expressed doubts that quadrex had the expertise or the money to 
get the plant going again 
the municipal utility shut the plant june 7 a day after voters 
became the first in the country to order an operating nuclear power 
plant to be closed the reactor had been plagued with problems for 
more than a decade and the utility had spent hundreds of millions of 
dollars on repairs in recent years 
quadrex was the only company to propose reviving rancho secos 
nuclear reactor other companies have proposed converting the plant 
to natural gas 
although other proposals to restart the reactor could surface 
any such plan would have to be approved by voters in the utility 
district as well as utility directors 
just after the directors vote monday night quadrex chairman 
william derrickson said the utility made a giant error but its a 
free country theyre trading no risk for a lot of risk 
but the director of a national antinuclear group said he was 
delighted with the decision 
this was a triumph of common sense over ideological zealotry 
and bravado said scott denman of the safe energy communiciations 
council which is based in washington dc

east germans have long viewed hungary as an 
attractive vacation spot in recent months it has also became a 
mecca for thousands hoping for a permanent change of address in the 
west 
reformminded hungary draws tens of thousands of vacationers each 
year from from east bloc ally east germany 
traditionally it has been relatively easy for east germans to 
obtain permission to travel to hungary but far more difficult to 
get approval for visiting the west 
in the past it has usually taken three or four weeks to get 
official approval to visit hungary once an application is filed with 
east german police 
getting approval to travel to the west can take years and many 
applications are rejected 
official figures are not available on the number of east germans 
who file applications to visit hungary or the west 
but according to unofficial estimates at least 1 million of 
east germanys 166 million people want to leave their communist 
homeland for good 
hungary has long offered east german vacationers a refreshing 
change even more so since hungary set out on the road toward major 
political reforms 
a 1969 border agreement between the two countries was an obstacle 
to east germans who might be tempted to try to cross into the west 
from hungary 
but in may hungary began removing its border barriers at least 
6000 east germans took advantage of the removals and fled to the 
west this summer 
then on sunday budapest announced that any of the 60000 east 
germans in hungary who wanted to leave for the west could do so 
thousands of those vacationers many of them having spent 
several weeks in refugee camps headed straight for the austrian 
border and hungarian officials said thousands more were arriving 
from east germany via czechoslovakia

a bulletin board inside passaus huge 
convention center has become the hub for many east german refugees 
trying to catch up with friends and relatives or find jobs and 
housing 
to the drichel family from coswig call hilda weve found you 
a place to stay reads one note on the board at niebelungenhalle 
about 500 of the new arrivals are staying at the center which 
has been filled with bunks and stoves and become a community in 
itself 
many of the estimated 11000 refugees who have arrived since 
hungary began letting them flee to the west at midnight sunday 
filled five tent camps near the austrian border and officials sought 
more space in military barracks 
in passau several hundred local residents waited for hours to 
greet new arrivals with cheers tears hugs and job offers 
a large banner outside the center said herzlich willkommen 
or hearfelt greetings red and silver helium balloons bearing 
the same message bobbed among the wellwishers 
this reception is really amazing said ute kindl a young 
east german woman im really speechless over the warmness and 
kindness here 
some said they were deeply grateful to hungary for opening its 
border 
well never be able to repay them for this said heinz 
schmidt 
inside niebelungenhalle red cross and other relief workers 
advised the emigres on how to get settled local residents donated 
hundreds of coats dresses and other clothes 
many refugees roamed the enormous building seeking information 
about friends and relatives who had made the trek west 
one source was the bulletin board 
hello michael im at the wilshofen camp your brother 
andreas said one note referring to one of several tent 
communities for refugees in bavaria 
would like to make contact with people from karlmarx stadt an 
east german city i was born there wrote one woman 
another message saids hello kirsten remember gabi from 
school reachable this weekend 
the bulletin board also contained offers of jobs ranging from 
bakers to nurses and electricians many prospective employers have 
been accustomed to having difficulty finding skilled craftsmen and 
apprentices 
hans klein chief government spokesman told a news conference 
that in passau alone 8000 job offers have been received for 
emigres 
while the locals warmly greeted the refugees elsewhere in west 
germany the flood of emigres and ethnic germans from other parts 
of eastern europe has caused some resentment a few west germans 
fear the newcomers are taking away jobs and scarce housing 
although the emigres were jubilant upon arriving in the west 
some also were worried about possible reprisals against loved ones 
left behind in their communist homeland 
scores lined up at public telephones to call families in east 
germany and friends and relatives in west germany 
our parents still dont know for sure what we have done said 
one young man who arrived with his wife from leipzig they asked not 
to be identified by name to reduce the risk of problems for their 
family 
we just hope this wont hurt them they east german security 
officials have a way of making life difficult for people whose 
relatives have fled to the west the man said

a simple case of gunrunning has 
emerged as a major national issue challenging president corazon 
aquino to deliver on promises to dispense justice and restore ethics 
in government regardless of the political cost 
the episode began sept 5 when customs agents at ninoy aquino 
international airport found 314 handguns and rifles in baggage 
allegedly owned by rep nicanor de guzman who had just arrived from 
california 
de guzman a member of the proaquino struggle of the democratic 
filipino party denied owning the weapons philippine airlines 
claimed he and a filipino businessman checked in the luggage at los 
angeles international airport 
the incident quickly took on a political dimension de guzman an 
obscure lawmaker from nueva ecija province is an associate of mrs 
aquinos powerful brother rep jose peping cojuangco 
in addition the incident occurred amid growing discontent over 
perceived corruption in government inaction in congress political 
favoritism and a breakdown in the criminal justice system 
de guzman remains free pending a magistrates investigation last 
month however dominique adams a 22yearold salt lake city woman 
was jailed after customs found 70 handguns in her luggage 
she was freed on bail and is awaiting trial 
preferential treatment of de guzman risks charges of political 
favoritism similar to what was rampant under ousted president 
ferdinand marcos a rush to justice risks undermining the system of 
political alliances which has helped keep mrs aquino in power 
what is at stake here is not only the case of one man said 
rep oscar santos this is not for the survival of the political 
life of one man but the collective life of congress itself because 
people might no longer believe in us 
so much media attention has been generated by the case that even 
if de guzman is innocent and exonerated many filipinos will assume 
he got off because of political connections 
almost everything the citizenry detests hates and abominates 
are writ large on this unfortunate affair wrote mrs aquinos 
former spokesman teodoro benigno in the philippine daily star 
unless she mrs aquino moves fast and moves dramatically she 
can be overtaken and overpowered by events 
realizing the political risks presidential advisers moved to 
contain the fallout through inept handling they made the situation 
worse 
two days after the weapons were seized mrs aquino summoned 
reporters and declared there would be no whitewash but 
reporters questions centered on rumors that her brother tried to 
intercede on de guzmans behalf 
as soon as i was informed of the discovery of firearms at the 
airport i called up my brother and told him that apparently some 
people are dropping your name mrs aquino said and definitely 
he has no knowledge of the matter 
mrs aquino never fully explained why her first reaction was to 
call her brother asked why cojuangcos name was often linked with 
political intrigue mrs aquino delivered a rambling answer which 
included the biblical admonition about those without sin casting the 
first stone 
the next day headlines in manila newspapers focused on mrs 
aquinos defense of her brother rather than her promise of no 
whitewash 
the de guzman case also threatens to strain relations between the 
administration and the house of representatives 
early today the house decided to suspend de guzman for 60 days 
but some congressmen complained the administration wanted to 
sacrifice one of their colleagues to boost its image 
through a system of alliances forged largely by cojuangco and 
house speaker ramon mitra the 199member house had been the more 
proadministration of the two congressional chambers 
but relations worsened after the cabinet announced last month 
that firearms imported by house members in 1988 but confiscated by 
the military would be publicly burned to show mrs aquinos strong 
commitment to law and order 
house members were widely criticized for trying to import the 
weapons many of them felt the cabinet had revived the embarassing 
issue to enhance mrs aquinos reputation at their expense 
the cabinet announcement followed a report by a private survey 
group the social weather stations that mrs aquinos approval rate 
among manila residents had dropped to 35 percent the lowest of her 
administration

new york democrats chose calm deliberate david dinkins over 
brash mayor edward i koch bringing the nations largest city 
closer to electing its first black mayor 
detroit mayor coleman young one of the first blacks to lead a 
major us city savored a big primary victory over a dozen 
challengers and democrats foiled republican designs on house seats 
in texas and california that were vacated by speaker jim wright and 
democratic whip tony coelho 
tuesdays primary election signaled the end of an era in new 
york although koch reminded supporters that it wasnt quite up 
youll have me from now to december 31st he said in a 
concession speech i do not intend to keep my mouth shut 
dinkins the manhattan borough president will face former 
federal prosecutor rudolph giuliani in the nov 7 election giuliani 
powdered cosmetics heir ronald lauder in an unusually bitter gop 
primary that saw lauder spend an estimated 12 million on negative 
advertising 
dinkins won the democratic nomination by cornering nearunanimous 
support from blacks and getting greaterthanexpected backing from 
whites 
his theme of uniting the city took on unexpected urgency in 
recent weeks after a white mob in brooklyn attacked and killed a 
young black man koch angered many blacks with his response to the 
killing 
in a victory speech dinkins urged supporters not to savor kochs 
loss were all together now he said remember me im the 
guy who brings people together 
with all the votes counted dinkins had 537313 or 51 percent 
to kochs 445816 or 42 percent two lesserknown candidates 
former transit chief richard ravitch and city comptroller harrison 
goldin split the rest 
giuliani had 75720 votes or 67 percent to lauders 36905 or 
33 percent giuliani will run as the candidate of the republican 
liberal and independent fusion parties and said he wanted to be a 
mayor in the mold of fiorello laguardia who served from 1934 to 
1945 
dinkins was joined at a victory celebration by jesse jackson who 
was active in the new york and detroit mayoral races jackson 
supported the winner in new york but wasnt able to rescue the 
failed campaign of rep john conyers in detroit 
conyers a 13term congressman with a national reputation was 
among the dozen candidates to challenge youngs bid for an 
unprecedented fifth term but accountant tom barrow brushed past 
conyers to place second in the primary giving him the right to go 
headtohead against young in a november runoff 
young steeled his followers for the campaign ahead 
dont celebrate too long because the war is not over he 
said the victory is not won 
with 92 percent of the precincts reporting young had 97618 
votes or 52 percent to barrows 43230 votes or 23 percent 
conyers was third with 33232 or 18 percent ten other candidates 
shared the rest 
with the victories in the two special congressional elections 
democrats have now won four of six special elections to fill house 
vacancies this year two more are scheduled 
in texas democrat pete geren narrowly won wrights fort worth 
seat defeating republican bob lanier with all 223 precincts 
reporting geren had 40210 votes or 51 percent to 38590 votes 
or 49 percent for lanier 
no one fills the shoes of the speaker of the house said 
geren a lawyer and former aide to us sen lloyd bentsen its 
going to be a long road back to restoring the clout and the 
influence that fort worth and tarrant county have grown used to 
having 
in californias san joaquin valley assemblyman gary condit 
defeated seven candidates including his main republican rival 
former assemblyman clare berryhill 
with all precincts reporting condit had 50527 votes or 57 
percent to 31166 for berryhill or 35 percent five other 
republicans and a libertarian divided the remainder 
by getting more than 50 percent condit avoided a runoff 
several cities besides new york and detroit held mayoral 
primaries 
buffalo ny mayor james griffin defeated two challengers in 
the democratic primary and ran unopposed on the republican 
conservative and right to life party ballots 
in new haven conn where mayor biagio delieto is retiring 
state sen john daniels defeated former city administrator john 
destefano jr in the democratic primary making it virtually certain 
that he will become the citys first black mayor 
minneapolis mayor don fraser easily topped a field of seven 
candidates in a nonpartisan primary but still must face his leading 
challenger firefighter jens peterson in november both ran on the 
democratic farmer labor party label 
in neighboring st paul where mayor george latimer is 
retiring city council president jim schneibel also of the dfl led 
a field of nine candidates former city councilman bob fletcher 
finished second and will face schneibel in november

democrat pete geren barely defeated a 
republican for the seat held 34 years by another democrat rep jim 
wright then he acknowledged he faced a big job in washington 
no one fills the shoes of the speaker of the house geren 
said its going to be a long road back to restoring the clout and 
the influence that fort worth and tarrant county have grown used to 
having 
geren received 40210 votes or 51 percent to 38590 ballots or 
49 percent for television commentator dr bob lanier in tuesdays 
special election runoff to replace wright who resigned during an 
ethics investigation 
the 37yearold winner a former aide to sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas will serve the remainder of wrights term which ends next 
year 
lanier who received endorsements from president bush and former 
dallas cowboys coach tom landry told supporters not to throw away 
campaign signs because hell probably challenge geren in 1990 for 
the seat 
we dont feel like we really lost that much said the 
44yearold political newcomer i mean we did better than 
anybodys done in this county for this particular party 
lanier led geren and six other candidates in a special election 
aug 12 but didnt gain a majority making the runoff necessary he 
is featured as medical commentator on 60second housecall a 
television spot syndicated to local news broadcasts in more than 40 
television markets 
republicans had hoped to break the democrats grip on the 
district but geren raised almost twice as much money as lanier and 
had previous experience a 1986 loss to republican joe barton for a 
different congressional district 
voters showed little interest in the campaign about 27 percent 
of the 287000 registered voters turned out 
wright resigned in june amid allegations he repeatedly violated 
congressional ethics rules involving speaking fees and business 
deals 
during the campaign to succeed wright geren and lanier 
emphasized their endorsements and differing backgrounds 
geren endorsed by wright and bentsen cited his experience as a 
legislative aide 
lanier said he was in better touch with his constituents 
concerns than his opponent 
geren supports sending us troops to colombia to fight drug 
dealers opposes restrictions on owning semiautomatic weapons and 
signed a pledge to vote against any new taxes he said the war on 
drugs will be his first concern on capitol hill

the last 13 otter pups rounded up after the 
exxon valdez oil spill six months ago have been shipped from alaska 
to the point defiance zoo and aquarium 
the otters arrived tuesday and were to spend up to three months 
at point defiance before being sent to zoos and aquariums around the 
united states said associate zoo director lily moore 
she said the otters cannot be released in the wild because they 
have become too accustomed to people 
a staff paid by exxon will provide 24hour care for the otters 
until they go to other zoos they will not be on public display 
the 13 otters either were rescued from the nations worst oil 
spill or born to mothers who had been brought to animal care centers 
in seward and valdez alaska after the march 24 spill in prince 
william sound 
these are orphans of the spill that will go other places 
hopefully to remind people there is a place otters can live in the 
wild and that place is fragile said bruce batten of the us 
fish amp wildlife service in anchorage 
the wildlife service said only the anchorage eagle center and the 
seward bird center still are caring for wildlife harmed by the spill

the federal government will close 59 square 
miles of the mojave desert under an emergency quarantine in hopes of 
protecting the endangered desert tortoise 
there is some evidence that some of the users out there are 
increasing the stress level in the tortoise said barbara 
maxfield a bureau of land management spokeswoman in riverside 
vandalism is the major cause for the decline in the 
population 
the closure to begin oct 1 and last up to a year will affect 
recreationalists specifically offroad enthusiasts who drive 
allterrain vehicles through the desert mrs maxfield said tuesday 
sheep grazing will continue as long as enough forage is left for 
the sheep sheep ranchers must apply for special permission to set 
foot on the land officials said 
gerald hillier blm california desert district manager said a 
minimum of 350 pounds of food for sheep must be available per acre 
the desert tortoises must have emerged before we will allow the 
sheep on public lands hillier said no more than five bands of 
800 animals each will be permitted 
he said there were provisions for miners also 
the quarantine area is north of this desert city 70 miles north 
of los angeles 
it was called so that researchers could monitor the species 
which was placed on the endangered list aug 4 by the us fish and 
wildlife service 
biologists are concerned that a respiratory disease is killing 
thousands of the burrowing tortoises which can live up to 80 years 
ravens and mans encroachment on the desert also threaten the desert 
animals 
the nonprofit desert tortoise preserve committee estimated last 
year that since the 1920s population has declined from an estimated 
1000 per square mile to as few as 20 per square mile in some parts 
of the mojave in california 
designation of the desert tortoise as an endangered species has 
disrupted a construction boom in las vegas the gambling city and 
several other parties filed suit last month in federal court in 
washington dc claiming restrictions on building should be 
confined only to areas where the respiratory disease is a problem 
two offroad races scheduled for sunday in the desert were 
canceled by the blm because of fears the motorcycles and 
fourwheeldrive vehicles would upset the species the american 
motorcyclist association which sponsored both races said the blms 
decision discriminates against offroad enthusiasts 
signs may be posted to warn of the closure and some fencing may 
be erected mrs maxfield said ranger patrols will be increased 
she added saying that those caught in the area would be cited for 
trespassing

edward i kochs first mayoral campaign lasted 
just 45 days and ended with neither a whimper nor a bang it ended 
in silence no one paid attention to this liberal congressman in 
1973 
what was trumpeted as kochs last campaign for mayor ended 
tuesday with a thumping defeat that altered the political landscape 
of the nations largest city perhaps forever 
the man whose feisty nasal tones came to signify new york for 12 
years was defeated by manhattan borough president david dinkins who 
became the citys first black mayoral nominee of a major party and 
everybody was paying attention this time 
i want you not to feel sorry for me koch 64 told 
supporters saying he had had 12 glorious years as mayor 
believe me there is a life after the mayoralty he said 
koch congratulated dinkins saying he won it fairly squarely 
and by a large margin a substantial victory 
koch lost for many reasons among them 
early in his administration he alienated many blacks by closing 
a harlem hospital after promising to keep it open he was constantly 
accused of racial insensitivity especially when he suggested jews 
would have to be crazy to vote for presidential candidate jesse 
jackson in 1988 
his third term was besieged by corruption queens borough 
president donald manes committed suicide as scandals were uncovered 
indictments followed 
many grew tired of kochs act irishamericans were infuriated 
when he said the british army was a peacekeeping force not an army 
of occupation others were offended when he declared war on street

a rocketmounted telescope has provided 
the clearest photographs ever taken of a solar flare and the suns 
outer corona a scientist said 
with only a 1hour launch window on monday scientists halted 
the countdown two minutes before ignition and waited for signs of a 
solar flare before launching the telescope aboard a 50foot rocket 
from white sands missile range 
leon golub a harvard university astrophysicist who headed the 
project said he received satellite data indicating an increase in 
xrays associated with solar flares before resuming the countdown 
the rocket soared to a height of about 200 miles before 
parachuting back to earth with 40 frames of exposed film 
solar flares are eruptions that burst suddenly from the face of 
the sun sending waves of electromagnetic radiation and charged 
particles out into space they can disrupt communications and cause 
northern lights on earth 
the sun currently is at the peak of an 11year cycle for flare 
activity but even so no more than 10 flares occur each day golub 
said in a telephone interview late tuesday from sunspot nm 
in a photograph released tuesday dramatic disturbances are seen 
swirling all across the face of the sun including one peculiar 
doubleloop flare that golub said he could not explain 
elsewhere bright loops are all part of the corona a layer of 
ionized gas surrounding the sun he said 
this picture shows much more detail than has ever been seen 
before in the corona golub said 
the photo also revealed a small point of bright light on the 
suns surface one theory suggests that such bright points are 
minimal during peak flare periods and increase dramatically as 
flares subside golub said he hopes to take more photos during a 
time of minimum solar activity in about five years to see if there 
are more bright points 
this is the first time weve ever really been able to see one 
of those little things he said of the small bright spot if we 
look again at solar minimum the sun might actually be covered with 
hundreds of those small regions 
golub said his camera improved on earlier models by using a 
mirror with multiple coatings that screen out all but one xray 
wavelength

due for release later this week 
the currency rate was showing little movement in tokyo said 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities co 
he said trading was mixed mainly because dealers were reluctant

and friday they include the retail price index for august and trade 
figures for july 
until then participants will remain cautious kanai said 
on the stock market the key index fell as investors remained on

a restaurant owner says he dropped a 
longstanding policy of refusing to serve black customers after 
enjoying a visit from an attorney for soul singer james brown 
bruce salter operator of the buffalo room said he would 
continue serving blacks as long as they dont come in and tear up 
the place 
salters policy against serving blacks has made the buffalo room 
the subject of investigations by the fbi justice department civil 
rights division and the state alcoholic beverage control commission 
george hill a black lawyer whose client brown is in prison in 
columbia said salter let him into the restaurant and bar twice 
tuesday 
hill said he had read that salter claimed to have once kicked 
brown out of his establishment 
i wanted to check it out hill said 
hill said when he knocked on the door early tuesday afternoon 
salter slammed the door in his face hill waited at the door and 
salter peeped his head out and asked what he wanted 
i told him i think youre a nice man hill said 
salter again retreated about five minutes later he walked out 
onto the covered porch and asked hill what he had meant about being 
a nice man 
he was breathing fire when i first came hill said 
eventually he invited me in we came into the bar first and then 
he said come on in the dining room and sit down i want to talk to 
you some more it turned into a 2 hour visit 
salter said he invited hill back because hill is an intelligent 
man and he enjoyed talking to him 
hill said he believes salter will continue serving blacks and 
did not invite him in just because the alcohol commission has 
scheduled a license revocation hearing for the buffalo room on oct 
12 
asked whether admitting hill had anything to do with the hearing 
salter said i aint gong to say nothing let them think what they 
want 
the 1964 civil rights act prohibits discrimination on the basis 
of race in such public places as restaurants conviction carries a 
maximum sentence of a 1000 fine and a year in prison

cable news network plans to launch an assault on 
the three major broadcast networks next month with an hourlong 
dinnertime newscast 
cnn which went after the big three tv networks in 1980 with 
roundtheclock news will begin airing the newscast from 6 pm7 
pm edt on oct 16 
because the networks newscasts are carried live in each time 
zone the program would air as early as 3 pm on the west coast 
currently cnn runs newswatch from 5630 pm edt and shows 
the entertainment news program show biz today at 630 pm cnn 
spokesman steve haworth said the new plan calls for show biz 
today to air at 530 pm edt and newswatch to run from 5530 
pm edt 
haworth said speculation that texas district judge catherine 
crier hired monday by cnn for a newscasting job would coanchor 
the new program was premature 
we wont know anything about that until she actually joins 
us he said shes on the bench until the end of september when 
she comes up with us and starts doing some training well start 
figuring what anchor role shell be playing with us 
haworth said the program would be designed to go headtohead 
with the networks which broadcast a halfhour of news at 630 
pm or 7 pm in some markets 
cnn which started in june 1980 has sports commentary talk and 
specialty shows but most of its 24hour schedule is updated news

accountant tom barrow knocked off 13term 
congressman john conyers in the citys nonpartisan mayoral primary 
to win a spot in a runoff against fourterm incumbent coleman young 
you can run coleman but you cant hide barrow a nephew of 
prizefighter joe louis told frenzied supporters tuesday night at 
his victory rally 
its time for you to come on out here because were going to 
talk about issues youre gonna have to explain coleman why it is 
that crime is so bad and what you intend to do to stop it 
young the citys first black mayor and dean of the nations 
black city executives wouldnt commit to a debate with barrow whom 
he beat 61 percent to 39 percent in the 1985 election 
with all precincts reporting young had 103827 votes or 51 
percent and barrow had 48695 votes or 24 percent conyers was 
third with 36247 or 18 percent ten other candidates including 
city council president erma henderson in a distant fourth place 
shared the rest of the vote 
young 71 celebrated at a jammed reception where music from 
michael jacksons bad album boomed over a sound system 
dont celebrate too long because the war is not over he 
said the victory is not won 
conyers who entered the race a day before the filing deadline in 
may refused to concede during a brief appearance at a reception 
tuesday night 
barrow 40 campaigned practically since losing the 1985 race 
but he has never held office and does not have a wellfinanced 
political machine to match youngs 
i think barrow unfortunately is not going to be able to 
mobilize the kind of organizational structure necessary to unseat 
the mayor said wilbur rich an associate professor of political 
science at wayne state university and the author of a young 
biography i think hell try to replay the 1985 election which is 
not going to be enough to give the mayor serious competition 
barrow campaigned on what he called youngs favoritism of 
downtown development over neighborhood renewal young meanwhile 
pointed to jobs and riverfront development created during his 16 
years in office 
young reported raising 5 million for what he says is his last 
election an unprecedented fifth term barrow campaign manager 
geoffrey garfield said barrows grassroots approach can match 
youngs media barrage 
we outorganized everybody else thats why we won garfield 
said it wasnt about the media the radio or computers we had 
people power and went door to door 
now that people know that coleman can be beaten we expect 
fundraising will pick up we got this far against a 25year 
congressman that everyone thought was going to wipe us out it was 
the most organized campaign this city has seen in 20 years 
conyers whose campaign appeared unfocused was given a slight 
edge over barrow in preelection polls because of his name 
recognition and quartercentury in congress representing detroits 
west side

three major cookie manufacturers have 
been ordered to pay procter amp gamble co 125 million to settle a 
5yearold patent infringement case 
chief us district judge joseph j longobardi signed a consent 
judgment tuesday saying keebler co of elmhurst ill nabisco 
brands inc of east hanover nj and fritolay inc of dallas 
infringed on procter amp gambles patent for homestyle cookies 
marketed under the duncan hines label 
the case was scheduled to go to trial in october but an 
agreement among the companies was reached late monday that says 
procter amp gambles patents are valid and enforceable according to 
donald p tassone spokesman for the cincinnatibased company 
keebler is to pay 529 million for the soft batch cookie it 
introduced in 1984 nabisco will pay 529 million for its almost 
home brand and fritolay will pay 191 million for its grandmas 
rich and chewy product 
once the lawsuit was filed the formulas for the three products 
were changed 
procter amp gamble said after it testmarketed its soft cookie in 
january 1983 the three competitors pirated the formula and beat it 
to the market 
the company sued the three in 1984 
the competitors countered that the patent was not valid 
it was very frustrating to see our competitors who were 
already in the cookie business beating us to market in most of the 
country with the very product we had developed and patented said 
john e pepper president of procter amp gamble 
the cookie brand never reached its projected market share 
tassone said 
the settlement will help but it will not make up for what we 
lost he said 
nabisco said it was delighted the protracted legal battle was 
settled and that the settlement will not hurt parent rjr nabiscos 
earnings 
fritolay said the settlement will be paid by insurance and will 
have no effect on the earnings of its parent company pepsico inc 
stuart l greenblatt spokesman for keebler said homestyle 
cookies have not been the market blockbuster that was originally 
anticipated 
the cookies market share began declining almost as soon as 
they were introduced said manfredi 
the cookies didnt turn out to be the bonanza expected said 
james f burnett of potter anderson amp corroon which represented 
fritolay

for inciting young people to sing tibetan independence songs and 
participate in the disturbances 
it said three men were convicted of spying for the dalai lama 
clique a reference to supporters of tibets former spiritual 
leader who fled to india with the dalai lama following a failed 1959 
uprising against the chinese army 
one man ngoizhu was sentenced to 11 years for spying and two 
others both former lamas or monks in lhasa were given fiveyear 
terms for collecting information about the march uprising for the

china for 700 years and are resentful of past suppression of 
tibetan religion and culture 
the dalai lama has suggested that tibet be granted selfautonomy 
in all matters except defense and foreign policy a proposal the 
beijing government has rejected more radical tibetans have called 
for the establishment of a sovereign nation under the dalai lama

democratic state assemblyman gary condit 
won a special election for the seat of former house democratic whip 
tony coelho who resigned in june rather than face a probe of his 
finances 
relying heavily on coelhos loyal supporters and strong political 
organization in this agricultural san joaquin valley district 
condit won 57 percent of the vote in tuesdays primary and easily 
avoided a november runoff 
clare berryhill a 64yearold republican rancher former state 
legislator and exdirector of the state agriculture department was 
a distant second 
with all precincts reporting condit had 50527 votes to 
berryhills 31166 or 35 percent five other republicans and a 
libertarian divided the remaining 8 percent 
under state law all candidates appear on the same primary 
ballot allowing voters to cross party lines 
coelho left the house following disclosures that he failed to 
report a 50000 loan to finance a junk bond deal he said there was 
nothing improper about the loan and that it was not reported because 
of a clerical error 
but the incident was magnified because it coincided with the 
ethics probe and downfall of former house speaker jim wright and 
coelho said he wanted to avoid giving republicans two prominent 
democratic targets 
though coelho left congress under a cloud condit and berryhill 
said tuesday night that coelhos support was a major factor in the 
41yearold democrats victory condit will serve the remainder of 
coelhos term which expires in 1990 
they had tony coelhos political machine behind them so they 
were better organized we were at a disadvantage from the very 
beginning berryhill said 
condit said coelhos resignation was not an issue because the 
voters in this district respected the way tony stepped down he was 
a great asset to the district 
instead of keeping his distance condit used television ads and 
mailings that stressed his ties to coelho 
i feel fabulous its a great victory a jubilant condit told 
about 300 supporters at his victory party 
major issues in the race included abortion highway congestion 
and agricultural problems 
condit said he personally opposed abortion but saw it as a 
personal decision that one needs to make for ones self 
berryhill opposed abortion except in cases involving rape incest 
and a threat to the life of the mother and he claimed the support 
of the california pro life council 
robert weimer a republican who fashioned himself as the only 
fullblown prochoice candidate drew only 33 percent of the vote

police today arrested a man they said organized a 
still unexplained effort to sell uranium to the us embassy in 
tokyo officials said 
so far nine people have been arrested in the case on charges of 
illegally handling the radioactive element 
japanese law requires special authorization to handle the 
element which can be used in nuclear power generation and to make 
nuclear weapons 
investigators still have not learned where those involved 
obtained the uranium or why they tried to sell it to the embassy for 
more than 2000 times its market price of 275 an ounce said an 
official of the tokyo metropolitan police department 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity identified the 
last of those arrested as kouki tomoda 51 an antique art dealer 
and former underworld gang member from yamatotakada in nara 
prefecture southwestern japan 
tomoda arrested at a tokyo hotel had been on a wanted list 
since sunday when police seized 88 pounds of uranium from an 
acquaintance of his in kurume fukuoka prefecture about 560 miles 
southwest of tokyo 
the acquaintance a food dealer identified as masateru yuwasaki 
41 also has been arrested the official said 
he said tomoda was suspected of having sold a capsule containing 
36 ounces of refined natural uranium to masao kikuchi 54 a former 
veterinarian for about 55000 in june kikuchi also is among those 
arrested 
police said the group took this sample to the us embassy on 
aug 8 and proposed to sell another 88 pounds for 83 million 
a us embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the embassy would not comment while the case is under investigation 
earlier the embassy said in a statement it had cooperated fully 
with japanese authorities 
those arrested earlier included a 43yearold woman who owns 
several small companies a 44yearold real estate firm owner the 
president of a securities firm in hong kong and a shrine employee 
uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in its 
natural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionable 
material known as isotope u235 
an analysis by the science and technology agency showed the 
sample taken to the embassy contained 07 percent u235 
nuclear experts say nuclear power generation needs uranium 
containing more than 3 percent u235 and a nuclear bomb needs 
uranium that contains more than 90 percent u235 
violation of uranium handling provisions in japans nuclear 
safety laws carries a penalty of up to a year in prison or a fine of 
up to 3500

david dinkins lost the first office he was 
elected to when the harlem district he represented in the state 
assembly was gerrymandered out of existence 
now dinkins is charting new political territory 
tuesday night he became the first black politician ever nominated 
by a major party to run for mayor of new york city defeating mayor 
edward i koch in the democratic primary he will face republican 
nominee rudolph giuliani in his bid to become the citys first black 
mayor 
you the people of new york made history today and i promise 
you i shall never let you down dinkins 62 told supporters at 
his victory celebration 
koch also had sought to make history he was pursuing an 
unprecedented fourth term but dinkins blamed him for ethnic and 
racial tensions and corruption scandals the fatal shooting of a 
black teenager confronted by a gang of whites three weeks before 
the election heightened the issue of race 
racial harmony was a centerpiece of dinkins campaign and he 
portrayed himself as a healer 
were all together now remember me im the guy that brings 
people together dinkins said in his victory speech 
to dinkins supporters such an attitude is typical they say he 
is cautious and thoughtful a conciliator and consensusbuilder 
they also say he is a gentleman even opponents like the 
contentious koch agree dinkins is a very decent guy 
but some question whether a nice guy can run a city facing a 
myriad of difficult problems stand up to special interests fighting 
over its 27 billion budget and ride herd over its more than 200000 
employees 
he has been careful to the point of timidity and his indecision 
sometimes frustrates his colleagues the new york times said of 
dinkins when it endorsed koch 
his friends say thats unfair 
some people try to be critical of the fact that he gives 
reasoned well thoughtout opinions which should be valued in 
public officials said rep charles rangel 
a trenton nj native he graduated in 1950 from howard 
university with a mathematics degree he moved to harlem in 1951 and 
was married two years later 
dinkins graduated from brooklyn law school in 1956 and became a 
democratic district leader in 1965 he won a state assembly seat 
but lost a reelection bid after his district was reapportioned 
he served as city clerk for 10 years until he was elected 
manhattan borough president in 1985 on his third attempt he is the 
citys highest elected black officeholder 
he has been outspoken against apartheid in south africa yet was 
slow to comment on the case of tawana brawley a black teenager who 
claimed she was sexually assaulted by a group of white men when he 
did he was critical of her advisers he also has denounced 
statements by louis farrakhan as antisemitic 
in a display of independence he supported jesse jacksons 1984 
presidential bid when other black leaders backed walter mondale 
jackson returned the favor by coming to new york twice to campaign 
for dinkins 
dinkins has been haunted by the four years 196871 when he 
neglected to pay his state income taxes the slip was revealed in 
1973 and cost him a deputy mayors post dinkins paid 15000 in 
back taxes and admitted his negligence 
he brushes off questions about that now saying it was an 
oversight that he rectified 
of average height and with a slight paunch dinkins exudes 
confidence and carries himself in a reserved and dignified manner 
hes an avid tennis player with a mean forehand even though hes a 
grandfather 
ive been described as a nice guy as a gentleman dinkins 
said last february but im also an exmarine and i dont intend 
for a second to get shoved around in this or any other campaign

kiko kawashima and her parents a college professor 
and a housewife sat down to a private dinner with their future 
inlaws the emperor and empress of japan 
the dinner tuesday at the akasaka palace in central tokyo capped 
a hectic day for the kawashimas that began with a meeting of top 
government officials to discuss whether their daughter was worthy of 
marrying into the worlds oldest imperial family 
as the 10member imperial household council headed by prime 
minister toshiki kaifu met at the palace a battalion of reporters 
and cameramen staked out the kawashimas small apartment on the 
campus of tokyos prestigious gakushuin university 
by 11 am it was official the 23yearold miss kawashima was 
engaged to marry prince aya the second son of emperor akihito and 
second in line to the chrysanthemum throne 
after announcing the engagement shoichi fujimori head of the 
imperial household agency and a member of the council said the 
decision was unanimous and added that he hoped a date for the 
wedding could be set as soon as possible 
ceremonies related to the wedding will not be held until after 
jan 7 end of a oneyear mourning period for ayas grandfather 
emperor hirohito who died at age 87 after a 62year reign 
when prince aya and his fiance met reporters for a news 
conference broadcast live nationwide tuesday afternoon miss 
kawashima already dubbed the apartment princess by the press 
for her humble background spoke hestitantly often shyly glancing 
at her fiance and clearly selfconscious about her future role 
my father told me that it was my life and a decision that i 
should make after careful thought she said her father 
tatsuhiko teaches economics at gakushuin the alma mater of much of 
japans royalty 
but prince aya said he had proposed to miss kawashima on june 26 
1986 a year after they first met at gakushuin where they were both 
students and had long awaited the day their romance could be made 
public 
i was taking her home after a gettogether that evening and i 
asked her while we were stopped for a light at a crosswalk the 
prince said 
aya is to complete postgraduate studies in zoology at oxford 
universitys st johns college next june and some palace watchers 
have speculated the two may live in england for a short time after 
they are wed 
as soon as things settle here i hope to return to england 
because i have much research i hope to do there aya said 
unlike the staid and proper crown prince aya is known to the 
japanese for his mustache yellow volkswagen beetle and gold 
bracelet which he wore to the afternoon conference 
the engagement of aya and the apartment princess is being 
hailed as another opening of the crysanthemum curtain that has 
kept japanese royalty apart from the public

veteran state sen john c daniels 
defeated a candidate backed by democratic leaders to become the 
partys first black nominee for mayor in this overwhelmingly 
democratic city 
as i campaigned throughout the city people said it was time 
for change daniels said in claiming victory tuesday night 
unofficial returns showed daniels capturing 16012 votes to 
11082 for john destefano a former top official of retiring mayor 
biagio dilieto destefano won the democratic town committees 
endorsement and gained automatic entry in the primary with the 
support of dilieto 
turnout tuesday was the highest in 10 years with 53 percent of 
the citys registered democrats going to the polls 
because democrats outnumber republicans by almost 10to1 in this 
city the winner of the democratic primary is widely expected to win 
the nov 7 general election 
the 53yearold senator will face alderwoman robie pooley 48 
she defeated attorney tobin hitt a political newcomer by 1227 to 
728 according to unofficial republican returns 
republicans have not held office in new haven for 36 years the 
last gop primary was 31 years ago 
destefano 34 urged all democrats to unite behind daniels 
you know it isnt all bad he told his supporters i came 
out of this with a better haircut and a better sense of humor 
both daniels and destefano had sought to keep the issue of race 
out of the campaign and both sought multiracial multiethnic 
support blacks represent about 35 percent and hispanics about 12 
percent of the citys 127000 population 
nevertheless daniels had described himself as the candidate who 
could best bring the citys diverse neighborhoods together 
a 5term senator who owns a plumbing business daniels once 
entered the 1969 mayoral race before withdrawing after several 
weeks he said he finally became a candidate two decades later after 
polls showed a minority candidate could win 
dilietos withdrawal made this primary the first in 20 years in 
which the incumbent was not seeking reelection

hungary said today it will break its warsaw pact 
commitment and keep open its borders to the west and an east german 
newspaper said it is time to consider why the countrys young 
skilled citizens are fleeing 
in austria the interior ministry said 12158 east germans had 
passed through that country en route to west germany in the two days 
that refugees have been taking advantage of hungarys newly opened 
border 
in budapest a government official said today that hungary has no 
intention of reversing its dramatic new pathway to the west and that 
it reflects the increasingly liberal communist nations new role in 
the world 
the hungarian governments policy of opening the countrys 
borders will continue said ferenc somogyi the no 2 official in 
the foreign ministry 
he said that as long as a third country is willing to accept 
refugees from other east bloc countries hungary will allow them to 
leave 
but he said that the current orchestrated migration was a 
unique step that applied only to east german citizens the 
east germans were not treated as refugees and they did not request 
asylum as refugees somogyi said 
east germans are automatically considered citizens of west 
germany and therefore technically do not qualify as refugees 
somogyi said the countrys openborder policy was consistent with 
hungarys status as a signatory of the un convention on refugees 
the only east bloc country to have signed it 
he indicated that such agreements with the west take precedence 
over warsaw pact commitments hungary by allowing citizens of a 
warsaw pact ally to flee across its borders violated a 1969 pact 
with the rest of the soviet bloc 
there are agreements with other warsaw treaty countries similar 
to the one hungary just suspended with east germany and these 
agreements are no longer in line with hungarys newly assumed 
international responsibilities such as our having signed the geneva 
convention somogyi said 
we are working to bring these various agreements into harmony 
with our new foreign policy he added 
in east berlin the communist party youth daily junge welt said 
that east german citizens no longer can avoid the discussion about 
why a minority has fled the country of 166 million people 
how do we make this country indisputably the focal point for 
dedication and happiness for every individual how do we make it a 
homeland for even more people in which one accepts burdens and from 
which one is not lured away just by shop windows full of bananas or 
glossy travel guides junge welt asked 
the newspaper often contains important articles and commentaries 
reflecting official views 
the new arrivals have said they were dissatisfied with the 
economic situation in their country and the political oppression at 
home many of the arrivals are young skilled craftsmen they also 
said east germany has failed to adopt political and economic reforms 
being tried in other communist nations 
the main east german party daily neues deutschland today 
continued its criticism of west germany which it contends has 
lured the refugees west 
it also criticized hungary for allowing their unsanctioned 
departure 
the refugees have traveled by car train and bus through austria 
to their new homeland since midnight sunday when hungary opened its 
border completely 
west german border officials said the number of refugees could 
top 15000 
the exodus comes at a time of dramatic change in the east bloc 
poland has installed the blocs first government led by 
noncommunists and hungarys leaders are promising free elections 
west germany and hungary have worked together to coordinate free 
passage for the east germans and that has added to the strain in 
relations between those countries and east berlin 
it is the first time an east bloc nation has assisted in an 
exodus to the west of citizens from a warsaw pact ally 
on tuesday yegor ligachev a hardline member of the soviet 
politburo arrived in east berlin and accused west germany of 
slander enticement and luring away east germans 
east german leader erich honeckers prolonged recovery from gall 
bladder surgery has complicated the situation communist party 
officials acknowledge that decisionmaking in east berlin is 
virtually paralyzed 
east germanys staterun news agency adn said tuesday the 
government issued a formal protest to hungary for its decision to 
unilaterally suspend parts of bilateral agreements on border 
controls adn said 
an estimated 50000 east germans were reported in hungary tuesday 
on tourist visas which have traditionally been relatively easy to 
obtain 
however sources say east germany police offices are now turning 
down many more applications for tourist visas to hungary than they 
are approving the sources say the offices are filled daily with 
applicants 
some unofficial estimates say 1 million of east germanys 166 
million people desire to emigrate to the west about 100000 are 
expected to emigrate to the west this year the largest number since 
207000 fled in 1961 the year the berlin wall was built 
at a crowded tent city in tiefenbach west germany bulletin 
boards with scores of job notices have been set up east germans uwe 
and norma koenig scanned a bulletin board on tuesday and said they 
will take their time deciding 
the east german government told us for years what we could and 
could not do said mrs koenig now were going to do whats 
best for us 
romania and czechoslovakia which like east germany have resisted 
reforms being carried out in hungary and poland criticized west 
germany but were restrained in their criticism of budapest 
in czechoslvakia more than half of the 400 east germans who had 
camped outside the west german embassy in prague gave up tuesday on 
their efforts to gain passage to the west and left the compound 
after being promised they would not face punishment if they returned 
home

eli lilly amp co says it has recalled batches 
of 10 prescription drugs and halted distribution from its plant here 
because of recordkeeping violations found by federal inspectors 
the pharmaceutical maker said it is confident there was nothing 
wrong with the safety or effectiveness of the drugs which were 
recalled tuesday from wholesalers and had never reached pharmacies 
an inpection by the food and drug administration last month found 
objectionable conditions in nearly every area of lillys 
indianapolis capsule and tablet plant including failure to have 
written standard operating procedures for many tasks and 
recordkeeping problems 
in nearly every system examined the available data were found 
to be incomplete or inaccurately summarized the fda said results 
of that inspection were made public tuesday 
in response lilly voluntarily recalled 18 batches of drugs and 
halted distribution of all products from the plant which 
manufactures a relatively small amount of the companys capsules and 
tablets said spokesman ed west 
distribution will resume when revised procedures have been 
established probably within weeks west said 
he said the recall and distribution shutdown would not affect 
availability of any major products and the cost to the company was 
negligible 
among the medicines recalled were darvon a pain reliever 
tapazole a thyroid medication aventyl an antidepressant and 
nalfon an antiinflammation drug 
acting director felix schneider of the fdas midwest office in 
detroit said the agency is looking at other lilly operations and 
will make similar inspections of other drug companies

a funeral home has agreed to pay up to 14200 
to settle charges of cremating bodies in cardboard boxes instead of 
the wooden caskets bought by grieving families 
the agreement between the federal trade commission and the former 
eddys funeral home in winnemucca was filed in federal court on 
tuesday 
this case was just your garden variety one of fraud ftc 
attorney nora dowd said it is very unusual though to sell 
someone a casket and say youre going to cremate a body in it and 
then use a cardboard box 
the funeral home was accused of violating federal regulations by 
misleading customers charging people for goods and services not 
provided and not giving them written lists of proposed charges 
under a consent decree the former operators of eddys must pay 
the government 10000 in civil fines one tenth the amount the 
funeral home was facing they also must contact at least 24 people 
who might have paid for a wooden casket that never was used in 
cremations in 1986 1987 and 1988 and refund them 175 each 
the former operators did not admit any wrongdoing under the 
consent degree 
the mortuary has been sold by gmjb of boise idaho and its name 
has been changed ms dowd wouldnt say what led to the allegations 
but usually information like this comes from consumers or 
workers in the funeral homes and sometimes the competition 
scott gilligan a lawyer for gmjb managing partner james 
mcmurtrey said the mortuarys former director alan olsen denied 
the allegations 
the funeral home had already been closed by the time the ftc 
complained and so we were stuck in a position of not being able to 
defend ourselves very well gilligan said and frankly because 
the funeral home was closed we didnt have a reputation to protect 
anymore so it was easier to settle the case

american colleges and universities will 
face a shortage of more than 6000 teachers by the end of the 
century if steps are not taken soon a study says 
through 1992 there will be 16 candidates available for each 
available teaching position according to the study being published 
by princeton university press but by 19972002 the study found 
the candidatestojob ratio will drop to 083 with 30934 
candidates to fill an estimated 37091 positions 
the greatest shortages will be not in the sciences as previously 
believed but in the humanities and social sciences the study found 
we need to increase overall production of new phds by 
twothirds said william g bowen coauthor of the report and 
president of the andrew w mellon foundation in the humanities 
and social sciences we need to double the current numbers 
the study by bowen a former princeton president and julie ann 
sosa a princeton graduate now studying at oxford university was 
believed to be the first statistical confirmation of an impending 
faculty shortage 
faculty retirements will contribute little to the shortage the 
study found but many new faculty jobs will open to accommodate the 
bulge of students now moving through elementary schools they will 
enter college starting in 1997 
restoring the candidatestojob ratio to an ideal 13 level would 
require a 64 percent increase in new doctorates overall and a 92 
percent increase in the humanities and social sciences the study 
estimated 
from 19972002 the study estimated the ratio would be 071 in 
the humanities and social sciences 080 in mathematics and the 
physical sciences and 113 in the biological sciences and 
psychology 
bowen said the statistics were projections not predictions 
enlightened policies can be adopted to increase the pipeline so 
that the shortages we envision do not come to pass he said 
bowen suggested universities shorten the time required to obtain 
a phd and increase the number of fellowships and the amount they 
pay it now takes about seven years to earn a phd in mathematics 
and more than 12 years in the humanities

hungary has a new foreign policy that 
calls for a bigger role in the world arena and it takes precedence 
over old commitments to the warsaw pact a top hungarian diplomat 
said today 
ferenc somogyi the no 2 official in the foreign ministry said 
hungary will keep open its borders to the west 
hungary which has been tacitly allowing east germans vacationing 
in that country to escape into west germany on sunday allowed an 
organized exodus of more than 12000 east germans to begin pouring 
into the west 
the hungarian governments policy of opening the countrys 
borders will continue he told the associated press 
he said that as long as there is a third country willing to 
accept refugees from other east bloc countries hunary will allow 
them to leave 
however the foreign ministry official emphasized that the 
current special measures announced sunday whereby east germans 
seeking to emigrate to the west may cross legally into austria was a 
unique step that applied only to east german citizens 
the east germans were not treated as refugees and they did not 
request asylum as refugees somogyi said 
east germans are automatically considered citizens of west 
germany and therefore technically do not qualify as refugees 
the hungarian decision to allow east germans to pass the border 
to austria was made after weeks of negotiations with the east berlin 
leadership proved unsuccesful in finding a solution for the 
thousands of east germans in hungary who refused to return home 
budapest suspended a 1969 agreement with east germany to allow 
the exodus 
the official made a distinction between the countrys refugee 
policy and the special measures in force for east germans 
hungary in may became the first soviet bloc country to literally 
begin dismantling the barbed wire fencing and technical barriers 
along its western border with austria saying they had become 
obsolete 
somogyi said the countrys openborder policy applied to these 
measures and hungarys status as a signatory of the un convention 
on refugees the only east bloc country to have signed it 
there are agreements with other warsaw treaty countries similar 
to the one hungary just suspended with east germany and these 
agreements are no longer in line with hungarys newly assumed 
international responsibilities such as our having signed the geneva 
convention somogyi said 
we are working to bring these various agreements into harmony 
with our new foreign policy he added 
as part of major reforms that include free elections planned by 
june the communist government is drawing up laws giving hungarian 
citizens the right to emigrate freely after more than 40 years of 
restrictions 
last year hungary began accepting refugees from allied romania 
an unprecedented step in intereast bloc relations 
anyone from any european country may apply for refugee status 
from the hungarian authorities somogyi said 
if the conditions stipulated in the geneva convention are met 
then the applicant would receive refugee status if there is a third 
country agreeing to take in that person there would be no obstacle 
raised by hungary he said 
dozens of romanians have attempted to cross from hungary into 
austria but have been turned back at the border by austrian 
authorities 
somogyi said it was still not decided how long the borders would 
remain open for the east germans however he recalled that the 
government announcement on the move stipulated that they would 
remain open as long as there is a country prepared to receive them 
or to allow transit 
so far more than 12000 mostly skilled young east germans have 
crossed into austria and the majority have already arrived in west 
germany

home

and the possibility of applying for legal emigration later and left 
the embassy

hopes of being granted free passage to the west like thousands of 
their countrymen in hungary who were allowed to flee into west 
germany this week 
about 150 east germans remained on the embassy grounds today 
apparently refusing to join their countrymen returning home 
wolfgang vogel an east berlin lawyer who has mediated bilateral 
german affairs met with the east germans at the embassy on tuesday

their own cars and 23 boarding a bus 
one 25yearold woman said while weeping that she was returing 
because i just couldnt take anymore 
the west german mission in prague was closed to the public aug

there in hopes of being allowed to emigrate to west germany 
scores more continued to arrive at the prague embassy after that 
and giant tents were erected on the grounds to house them 
west german officials said those who left the embassy for home 
had done so of their own free will it was not clear what the rest 
of those still on the embassy grounds would decide to do

senate democratic leaders were exploring today 
whether to accept a white house offer to work out a compromise on 
antidrug legislation 
the democrats insist president bushs 79 billion plan is 
inadequate while republicans say the democratic alternative 
providing 22 billion more is too expensive 
senate majority leader george mitchell said democratic lawmakers 
would meet to discuss what the best course of action would be to 
white house requests for a compromise 
one thing clear is the inadequacy of the presidents plan and 
the need to improve it to provide substance to the words 
mitchell dmaine told reporters as partisan maneuvering continued 
on the drug issue 
mitchell and his gop counterpart sen bob dole of kansas held 
talks on the democratic proposal tuesday further meetings among 
lawmakers from both parties were planned today 
dole and other top gop senators also met with top white house 
officials emerging to say republicans want to make a deal with the 
democrats 
the administration is prepared at any time to sit down 
and see if there is some way to bring it together dole said 
the closeddoor sessions were held after senate appropriations 
committee chairman robert byrd dwva with mitchells support 
proposed a 39 billion antidrug program as an amendment to the 
119 billion transportation spending bill for next year fiscal 
1990 begins oct 1 
meanwhile bush went on television tuesday to ask schoolchildren 
across the country to help any friends who use drugs rejecting 
drugs wont make you a nerd bush said adding im asking you 
to find someone who needs you and offer to help 
he said ill let you in on a secret we all can succeed if 
you dont use drugs you can be anything you want to be so 
dont blow it 
also a pair of senate appropriations subcommittees adopted their 
own antidrug proposals 
byrd said his plan would add 39 billion to the 62 billion 
congress otherwise planned to spend on antidrug efforts next year 
the 101 billion total would be 22 billion more than what bush 
has sought 
but the white house announced that top administration officials 
would urge bush to veto it 
it throws money at the problem rather than providing a plan 
said a statement by the white house office of management and budget 
byrd told reporters he was puzzled by the white house 
statement and referred to the presidents televised speech last week 
in which he revealed his own drug proposals 
mr bush went on tv the other night and stated in eloquent 
fashion that the drug war was right here on our streets byrd 
told reporters i believed what he said this is my way of trying 
to develop something thats comprehensive 
byrds plan would include 11 billion for drug and alcohol 
treatment and 1 billion for new prisons and would divide its 
resources 53 to 47 percent between law enforcement and treatment 
programs it would be financed by a 0575 percent cut in defense and 
domestic spending except for social security and other benefit 
programs 
republicans however argued that byrds plan would provide more 
money than can efficiently be spent provides too little for 
enforcement efforts and would slash an intolerable 18 billion out 
of defense 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
supports a bipartisan measure approved tuesday by the senate 
commerce justice and state subcommittee 
that provision would slice 0225 percent from the rest of the 
budget raising 18 billion for law enforcement it would remove 
675 million from the pentagon 
also on tuesday 
the senate appropriations defense subcommittee approved a 2797 
billion military spending bill for next year containing 105 
billion for drug efforts eight times the 132 million bush had 
requested 
drug policy coordinator william j bennett told the house 
foreign affairs committee to expect bushs drug efforts to cost 50 
billion over the next five years 
state and local officials contended the bush antidrug plan 
would strain their budgets without providing the money to get the 
job done mayor joseph p riley of charleston sc told the senate 
judiciary committee the 350 million proposed to help state and 
local governments bolster law enforcement adds up to less than 1 
percent of what they already spend

twentyfive rockets exploded around 
kabul airport today killing one soldier injuring three and setting 
a soviet supply plane on fire witnesses said 
also today a guerrilla commander announced his fighters have 
started a northern offensive to cut soviet supply routes to kabul 
in the south guerrillas reportedly pushed back a 1000vehicle 
army convoy with winter provisions for afghanistans second largest 
city kandahar 
workers at kabul airport said the facility was shut down after 
the attack but air traffic resumed in the afternoon 
officials would not confirm the attack 
the casualties occurred at a military base near the airport used 
by civilian and military aircraft airport workers said 
they said a sovietmade antonov supply plane was set ablaze by a 
rocket as it taxied to the runway the crew jumped off after the 
first rockets fell witnesses said workers and witnesses all 
demanded anonymity 
one missile fell 40 yards from the airports executive lounge 
blasting out its glass window and forcing officials inside to take 
shelter 
it also just missed a un jet scattering shrapnel that 
punctured holes in the aircraft the witnesses said un officials 
patched the plane with special metal tape 
more than 300 people have been killed and more than 700 injured 
in almost daily rocket attacks since june by fundamentalist moslem 
guerrillas 
reporters waiting downtown for a special flight to kandahar were 
told they could not leave because of technical difficulties 
in neighboring pakistan western diplomatic sources said a 
massive afghan army convoy of trucks tanks and armored personnel 
carriers from the soviet union was turned back from kandahar by 
fierce guerrilla attacks 
its original size reportedly was between 1000 and 1300 trucks 
tanks and armored personnel carriers but diplomatic sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the insurgents may have 
destroyed more than 110 vehicles 
kabul government officials said the convoy is carrying winter 
provisions for 200000 people in besieged kandahar it has taken the 
column more than two weeks to travel 400 miles south from torghundi 
at the soviet border 
guerrillas destroyed about 80 vehicles at the halfway point near 
shindand diplomatic sources said the convoy eventually pushed to 
within 36 miles of kandahar when guerrillas again destroyed 30 
vehicles they said 
at latest report the column had retreated 33 miles and split 
into two with helicopters lifting some of the cargo to kandahar 
it would take an exceedingly long time for the regime to 
transport any significant portion of the convoys cargo to kandahar 
in this way said one diplomatic source 
meanwhile guerrilla commander ahmad shah masoud sent a radio 
message to pakistan where the insurgents are based saying his 
forces are attacking four areas along the key salang highway north 
of kabul including the communist governments biggest air force 
base at bagram 
his message gave us no details about casualties but he said the 
mujahedeen guerrillas gained some very big successes especially 
at salang said masoud khalili a spokesman of the jamiatiislami 
rebel group 
masoud is considered the most effective of guerrilla commanders 
who have fought 10 years to topple the sovietbacked government 
the diplomatic sources said intense fighting continues around the 
eastern garrison town of khost with high casualties on both sides 
they said guerrillas shot down one transport plane and destroyed 
four more on the ground at khosts military airport between thursday 
and saturday 
the guerrillas have failed to capture a major afghan city since 
the last soviet forces withdrew from the civil war on feb 15

the energy department said today it was 
installing a new manager at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in 
colorado to replace edward s goldberg who was at the center of a 
controversy in july over a possible shutdown of the facility 
the department said david p simonson a nuclear engineer with 16 
years experience in the federal nuclear weapos program would take 
over for goldberg later this month 
simonson 46 has been acting deputy manager at rocky flats since 
july 12 before that he was deputy director of the energy 
departments office of nuclear materials production 
goldberg has been acting manager of rocky flats near denver 
since june the department said goldberg would be sent to its 
hanford operations office in washington state which oversees 
operations at the hanford nuclear weapons site 
the announcement did not say what position goldberg would take at 
hanford 
energy secretary james d watkins said in a statement he was 
pleased simonson had accepted the tough assignment of managing 
the rocky flats site which produces plutonium triggers used in 
nuclear warheads 
the department said last month that goldberg in july had 
threatened to close rocky flats unless the managers there were 
granted immunity from prosecution for ongoing violations of 
environmental laws 
as a result of goldbergs concern about criminal liability the 
department and the environmental protection agency agreed they would 
find a solution to the continuing environmental violations by sept 
15 
the justice department is conducting a criminal investigation of 
alleged violations of laws governing disposal and storage of 
hazardous and lowlevel radioactive wastes at the site the probe 
has gone to a grand jury in colorado and no charges have resulted

resignations by top west virginia 
officials and the defeat of three amendments proposed by the 
governor have dented the credibility of the states political 
leaders insiders and observers said 
four politicians have left office in shame this summer and a 
former state senate president is on trial in federal court on 
extortion and racketeering charges 
gov gaston caperton won election last november with a campaign 
to clean the states sullied image he pushed for the three 
amendments as essential parts of his reform plans only to see them 
trounced on saturday opponents of the amendments had accused him of 
a power grab 
some analysts said the rejection showed voters are fed up with 
their political leaders 
historically west virginia has had a relatively high tolerance 
for corruption in government said joe mccoy a political science 
professor at marshall university 
but citizens today are fed up with it and are expressing those 
feelings to prosecutors and elected officials the diligence of 
these investigations are because of a heightened consciousness 
residents want change 
capertons plan to fix the states image was foiled almost from 
the start when an audit late last year found that west virginia had 
bungled its finances and lost more than 270 million in investments 
an investigation led to the impeachment and resignation of treasurer 
a james manchin last july 
shortly after the headlines on that story faded attorney general 
charlie brown resigned aug 21 as part of an agreement to halt a 
probe into his campaign finances and reports that he lied under oath 
during a child custody hearing 
next state sen si boettner resigned after pleading guilty aug 
30 to income tax evasion then senate president larry tucker 
resigned thursday after agreeing to plead guilty to extortion 
charges 
and last week former state senate president dan tonkovich went 
on trial on extortion and racketeering charges in what prosecutors 
say was a deal to influence legislation in return for money 
in the wake of those scandals caperton suffered his first major 
setback 
by a landslide voters defeated amendments that would have 
eliminated three state offices and put their duties under the 
governors control given the governor greater authority over 
education and allowed cities and counties to reorganize 
one of the principles of politics of a new governor is never to 
load the voters up with too long an agenda so that they can digest 
it said david bingham a political science professor at west 
virginia university 
earlier this year caperton raised taxes by nearly 400 million 
and the legislature borrowed 135 million to begin paying off a debt 
estimated at 300 million to 400 million 
since taking office in january caperton also has reorganized 150 
departments under seven super secretaries divided the board of 
regents into separate entities and created an ethics commission to 
study conflicts of interest in state and local government 
caperton blamed the defeat of his proposed amendments on bad 
public relations but house speaker chuck chambers a democrat like 
the governor said the results amounted to a referendum on 
capertons performance and showed voters were unhappy about the tax 
increase 
bingham agreed the voters are mad about the taxes and somewhat 
mad about the reorganization he said 
in recent surveys residents named unemployment and taxes as the 
states most pressing problems seventy percent of residents in an 
august survey felt caperton was doing a fair or poor job 
the senate turned over a new leaf on tuesday in electing keith 
burdette as president to replace tucker burdette at 34 the 
youngest person to hold the job said his top priority is restoring 
credibility to state government 
the jobs got to be done weve got to pick up and go on 
said burdette theres no question were an institution in 
crisis but you have to believe that the overwhelming majority of 
the members of this legislature are good people who dont have their 
hands in somebody elses pocket

the bush administration told congress today it 
wants to accept 50000 soviet refugees and an additional 6500 from 
eastern europe in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
overall 125000 refugees would be admitted an increase of 
almost 8 percent over current quotas said jewel s lafontant the 
us coordinator for refugee affairs 
the 50000 soviet refugees at least half of whom are expected to 
be jews would be a fraction of the 250000 soviet citizens the 
state department estimated last week would apply for entry in fiscal 
1990 
lafontant testifying before the house judiciary subcommittee on 
immigration said 40000 of the 50000 soviet refugees would be 
assisted by the us government in paying their transportation and 
settlement costs the 10000 others would depend on private 
organizations friends and relatives 
beyond the refugee program other wouldbe immigrants can apply 
for admission under a separate socalled parole program which 
carries no financial assistance 
the current combined quota for refugees from the soviet union and 
eastern europe is 50000 the new plan would allocate all 50000 
slots to the soviet union to deal with an unprecedented outflow 
under president mikhail gorbachev and set up a separate category of 
6500 for eastern europe mostly from poland and hungary 
other projected quotas include 25000 for east asia 26500 for 
vietnam 3500 for latin america and the caribbean and 3000 for 
africa 
in fiscal 1988 as emigration from the soviet union began to 
climb the combined quota for the soviet union and eastern europe 
was 15000 
an estimated 40000 jews are expected to leave the soviet union 
this year currently there is in addition a backlog of an 
estimated 30000 to 40000 jews who have not left the soviet union 
or are in vienna and rome seeking entry to the united states 
most soviet jews who obtain exit permits say they want to live in 
israel but all but a fraction then apply for admission here once 
they have left their country 
according to jewish sources who demanded anonymity the bush 
administration will drastically revise its processing procedures 
refugees who applied before oct 1 the beginning of the 1990 fiscal 
year will be processed in rome and vienna 
but in the future applications will be handled by a beefedup 
us embassy staff and also by a new office to be set up outside 
washington sources said 
the us official who also asked not to be named said that 
cutoff date was likely though it might be set for a few months 
later 
while the soviets seeking admission remain in their country 
their applications would be considered both in moscow and in the 
washington area office 
israel has expressed concern that jewish refugees from the soviet 
union were increasingly choosing to settle in the united states once 
out of their homeland depriving israel of desirable immigrants 
it was not clear whether the change in procedure would increase 
the flow of refugees to israel 
the rising exodus from the soviet union which results from us 
pressure as well as reforms undertaken by gorbachev poses 
administrative and financial problems for the bush administration 
eager to reinforce the right of soviet citizens to travel freely 
us officials stress they will keep the door to immigrants open 
but they also emphasize the strain the wave of immigrants imposes on 
us funds 
the increased refugee flow brings problems in its wake 
lafontant told the house panel but how much better it is to have 
to deal with the problems caused by the success of ones policies 
than to deal with problems caused by failure

police said the car was severely damaged and blamed palestinian 
nationalists 
in the occupied gaza strip masked arabs stabbed to death a 
palestinian suspected of collaborating with israel officials

21monthold revolt against israeli rule during the uprising 567 
palestinians have been shot in clashes with the israeli army or 
civilians and 40 israelis have been killed 
in jerusalem three dailies quoted american and israeli sources 
as saying egyptian president hosni mubarak in coordination with the 
united states soon will issue invitations for a peace meeting in 
cairo 
it would include a palestinian delegation from the occupied lands 
and an israeli delegation haaretz and davar newspapers said 
american and soviet officials also would be invited the 
englishlanguage jerusalem post said 
davar reported the proposal was discussed last week by us 
secretary of state james a baker iii and israels defense minister 
yitzhak rabin 
davar and haaretz said the palestinian delegation would adopt 
mubaraks 10point peace proposal while israel would adhere to its 
plan for elections in the occupied lands for negotiators of an 
interim settlement with israel

plan telling haaretz the palestinians must adopt israels plan

stance on the egyptian plan 
of the four leaders only peres has supported the egyptian plan 
calling for talks based on the usbacked principle of trading land 
for peace and giving voting rights to 140000 east jerusalem arabs 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes territorial concessions 
and says giving east jerusalem arabs a vote would undermine the 
unity of jerusalem as israels capital peres leftleaning labor 
party accepts both ideas 
abba eban a senior labor politician and former foreign minister 
today urged the government to adopt egypts proposal 
it would be quite irresponsible to reject the egyptian peace 
initiative we must understand that israels proposal has reached 
the deadest of dead ends eban told israel radio after returning 
home tuesday night from a meeting with egyptian officials in cairo 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat has not 
commented on the plan but one of his main backers nablus 
businessman saeed kenaan said he favored it it has good points 
and i think it can be used as a starting point kenaan said in an

of reprimand accusing zalay of giving that policyholder erroneous 
advice the former boss edward dooley also sent copies to the home 
office in boston 
zalays attorney elihu berman said zalay never gave the 
policyholder any advice 
zalay also charged that the company sent investigators who told 
his clients he was giving bad advice he said investigators told 
policyholders he was under investigation for shady dealings 
accusations that could not be substantiated 
zalay maintained the company wanted him out because he urged 
clients to buy new insurance by piggybacking using the dividends 
or cash value of their policies to buy more insurance zalay said 
company officials were upset because they were assuming greater risk 
without collecting more money 
lawyers for dooley and john hancock argued that zalay was a 
difficult abrasive employee who tried to steal clients from other 
agents and threw tempertantrums in the office 
the jury award included 2505 million in punitive damages

president bush shone the white house spotlight 
today on a school program that teaches youngsters to resist drugs 
and wound up hearing a tough lecture from a 13yearold against the 
death penalty he favors 
chantee charles of nearby arlington va one of three youngsters 
invited to speak at a rose garden ceremony appeared to take the 
president aback with her musings on capital punishment which she 
called murder 
it does not solve anything the guard that turns on the 
switch to electrocute the prisoner is just as much a murderer as the 
person who has commited the crime the seventhgrader said 
she added that the executioner must feel guilty afterwards but 
i guess they get paid for it 
chantee claimed that probably thousands of innocent prisoners 
have been executed and argued that death penalty proponents miss 
the point that the prisoner has a family too 
she told reporters afterwards she did not know of the presidents 
stance in favor of the death penalty 
after hearing two other young people talk about the need to 
resist peer pressure to use drugs bush who favors the death 
penalty for copkillers and drug kingpins said my turn 
but instead of rebutting chantee the president thanked all three 
youths and said 
its not easy to get up in front of a big scary audience like 
this and do such a good job say whats on your heart not worry if 
people agree with you or not but recognizing that theres a common 
theme here that you all did a beautiful job on and that is turning 
your back on drugs 
the president then launched into a pitch for the 79 billion 
antidrug strategy he announced sept 5 and has trumpeted daily in 
speeches and ceremonies such as the one today that honored the los 
angelesbased drug abuse resistance education or dare program 
bush recalled that he attended a class last year where a los 
angeles police officer was teaching the dare curriculum and i know 
it works 
dare has spread from its start in 50 los angeles classrooms in 
1983 to more than 50000 classrooms across the united states and 
abroad he said 
these kids have dared to excel and they are succeeding 
the president said so far so good and yet so far to go let 
us finish the job dare has started and create an america we can all 
be proud of an america free of drugs 
bush also conferred with leaders of more than a dozen major 
education groups including keith geiger of the national education 
association and albert shanker of the american federation of 
teachers that meeting came two weeks before the presidents sept 
2728 education summit with the nations governors in 
charlottesville va 
former democratic presidential contender jesse jackson also 
visited the white house today to confer with bushs chief of staff 
john sununu on the drug strategy 
later bush was presiding at another white house event to push 
for passage of legislation to help spur adoptions of children born 
with disabilities and other special needs 
on tuesday the president played principal with a televised 
address from his library beamed into schoolhouses across the nation 
appealing to youths to resist the overtures of drug peddlers 
im asking you not to look the other way said the president 
in an address that combined avuncular persuasion with grim warnings 
of the consequences of drugs 
even dabblers in drugs bear responsibility for the blood being 
spilled in drug warfare across america and in colombia bush said 
young people risk losing their drivers licenses their futures and 
even their lives from drugs he warned 
and in words his audience was sure to understand he insisted 
saying no wont make you a nerd it wont make you a loser 
meanwhile administration officials and democrats were 
skirmishing over how to fund the proposed 79 billion battle 
against drugs 
bush wants to cut other domestic programs to find the extra 717 
million needed for his strategy in fiscal 1990 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the administration would 
reluctantly support a bipartisan plan approved by a senate 
appropriations subcommittee that would cut 0225 percent from 
defense and many domestic programs to raise 18 billion for the war 
on drugs 
she said administration officials were continuing to meet with 
leaders of congress to search for a compromise 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater accused democrats of 
playing pricetag politics with the drug plan after senate 
appropriations chairman robert byrd dwva proposed boosting the 
drug package to 101 billion and financing it by an 
acrosstheboard 0575 percent cut in military and other 
discretionary programs

the plain dealer cleveland on freedom of expression 
boron calif is not alone in its thoroughly unamerican crusade 
to ban books and thwart freedom of expression ugly coalitions of 
modernday book burners are increasingly successful around the 
nation in banning a range of books from classics to innocuous works 
people for the american way in a report called attacks on the 
freedom to learn has documented 172 incidents of censorship in 42 
states in the 198889 school year that these attacks are aimed at 
public schools is particularly disturbing a nation at risk is 
still struggling with children dropping out or graduating without 
the ability to read and write 
all the wrong messages were sent to public schools by a group of 
parents in boron who were successful in prohibiting a high school 
teacher from assigning jd salingers a catcher in the rye 
mostly because the word goddamn appears in the book a 
reasonable american would submit that the remote possibility that a 
student would be shocked by that word is outweighed by the benefits 
of reading the classic 
that an adult would discourage a child from picking up a book is 
beyond reason when teachers and parents have a difficult enough time 
coaxing a generation of couch potatoes near a library it is as if 
an army is fighting to get a child to read while the enemy tries to 
take the childs book away 
as several organizations are primed to insert creationism in 
science texts and remove sex education from the classroom the need 
for everyones involvement becomes ever more dramatic all must be 
alert to this fact the wave of censorship spreads from a minority 
of loud extremists who want to take your childs book away its 
your job to stop them

there is no guarantee the house will also vote to limit mass 
mailings important details remain to be worked out notably 
whether postagefree newsletters to households will be eliminated or 
just limited to two per year still the senate action is a start 
the vote shows that the senate is serious about doing away with a

the information sent to earth from voyager 2 feeds our insatiable

the seattle postintelligencer on aids in the schools 
the national association of state boards of education has 
produced a refreshing and encouraging list of recommendations on how 
schools should deal with students and teachers who are afflicted 
with the aids virus 
until now according to a booklet published by the 
organization many people have been fearful that aids could be 
transmitted at school we have enough information to stop worrying 
about this what we do need to worry about and the place to put 
our energy and concern is into education 
the medical evidence is clear you dont catch aids from casual 
everyday contact at school 
the next step according to the nasbe recommendations is 
virtually absolute anonymity for aids victims within the schools 
vengeful and narrowminded parents and their children pose a much 
higher risk to children who are already the victims of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome than the risk posed to them by those 
victims

imagine this scenario the washington post discloses that 
archconservative sen jesse helms of north carolina has hired a 
streetwalker convicted felon and child pornographer to be his 
personal secretary helms does not deny the sordid facts of the 
arrangement but claims he was just trying to rehabilitate the woman 
after the democrats in congress and the press got done laughing 
helms would be served his head on a platter 
the helms scenario is fictitious barney franks case is not 
in 1987 frank the powerful ultraliberal congressman from 
massachusetts answered a sexwanted ad in a gay newspaper the 
creature who placed the ad was stephen gobie a male prostitute and 
convicted felon who was on probation for sodomy selling drugs and 
producing obscene material involving teenagers 
frank paid for gobies sexual favors allowed him to move in and 
hired him as an aide for about 20000 a year gobie proceeded 
to set up a prostitution ring out of franks bachelor pad in 
washington 
naturally the vocal gay lobby has leaped to franks defense 
claiming that poor barney is being persecuted simply because hes 
gay this is pure baloney no heterosexual congressman or senator 
would have the slightest hope of escaping condemnation and the 
destruction of his political career if he had carried on the way 
frank did 
not at issue by the way is franks homosexuality one should 
never be persecuted for what one is only for what one does and 
what frank did should earn him a roasting before the ethics 
committee and a oneway ticket back to michael dukakisville

spacecraft has radioed back from the neighborhood of neptune leave a 
craving for an encore 
an engineer for the national aeronautics and space administration 
has an idea for supplying one a lowbudget trip to pluto 
robert farquhar manager of the small missions program for nasa 
thinks a spacecraft could be launched to pluto in about a dozen 
years by piggybacking it on a probe that nasa already plans to send 
to examine the sun 
farquhar believes that the probe could be built so that at 
jupiter it could split sending one part back to the desired path 
over the sun and the other on to pass pluto in about 2014 
the amazing discoveries the voyagers have made whet a hope 
that a plan like farquhars might be made to work

its hard to find reason for hope in south africa but recent 
national elections may shine a sliver of light for the future of the 
minority white government 
gains by the antiapartheid forces on the left were partially 
offset by gains on the racist right both gained strength at the 
expense of the majority party in the center 
what that could mean for the future isnt certain it suggests 
that south african whites are becoming more polarized but that may 
be the only way to force the afrikaner majority to abandon the 
stupidity of apartheid grant blacks a voice in the future and 
rejoin the civilized world

wilkesbarre pa times leader on communism 
so far its been a lousy year for communism 
there has been widespread revolt against the red menace in 
poland which in january elected its first noncommunist government 
in about 40 years 
in china last june about a million students and workers spent 
weeks protesting communist domination in their country a rebellion 
that wouldnt quit until the army on orders from the government 
moved in with tanks and bullets 
not long ago the people of latvia estonia and lithuania started 
turning up the heat in their quest to rid themselves of soviet 
domination 
and on monday came the latest slap in the face to the 
powerbrokers of communism when 7000 east germans fled to freedom 
incredibly they were able to do so because another communist 
country hungary agreed to their passage to austria and 
eventually west germany 
what has prompted this welcome trend and why now all of a 
sudden as we see it several factors are responsible for one 
thing communism has not delivered on its promises instead of 
prosperity in its host nations it has brought economic decline 
instead of spreading happiness it has brought grief instead of 
gaining respect for its followers worldwide it has brought them 
shame

roswell nm daily record on illegal aliens in the census count 
since the first nationwide count in 1790 the census bureau has 
tallied the entire population of the united states as the 
constitution specifies without regard to individuals residency 
status 
but there is now a move on capitol hill to disregard illegal 
immigrants in the 1990 tally 
the intent of this effort led by a number of southern senators 
and representatives is to dilute the congressional representation 
of states such as arizona california florida illinois new mexico 
and texas whose populations include large numbers of undocumented 
aliens 
the head count is required by the constitution every 10 years to 
apportion seats in the house of representatives because the total 
number of house seats remains constant at 435 states with 
fastgrowing populations pick up additional seats at the expense of 
states where the growth rate is below average 
lawmakers should read the constitution including the 14th 
amendment which uses the word persons as opposed to 
citizens in determining electoral apportionment 
every census in the past 200 years has counted all persons to do 
otherwise would pretend that literally millions of residents in our 
midst simply dont count

senators weighing the options of a regular bill 
or a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning heard today that 
veterans groups arent united on the issue 
the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars told the 
senate judiciary committee they supported president bushs position 
that a constitutional amendment was the only way to overcome the 
supreme court ruling that made flag burning a legally protected form 
of expression 
the testimony came a day after the house sent the flag issue back 
to the senate by approving its bill outlawing flag burning by a 
38038 margin 
we believe the only ironclad way to protect our flag is through 
a constitutional amendment said walter g hogan the vfws 
commanderinchief whether any regular statute could pass muster 
with the court was doubtful he said 
leaders of the vietnam veterans of america and the paralyzed 
veterans of america said however they thought a statute could be 
tried first before tinkering with the constitution 
our members share the fury factor with other americans on 
this subject but they are unprepared to sacrifice free speech in 
the process of assuring that flag desecration is properly 
punished said mary r stout national president of the vietnam 
veterans group 
democrats after tuesdays house vote that passage of the statute 
might weaken the push for a similar constitutional amendment but 
bush and others vowed to fight for their politically more strident 
approach 
i think there are probably enough members now that will vote 
against a constitutional amendment that they wont be able to get 
the twothirds required by the constitution to pass one said rep 
mike synar dokla 
rep steny hoyer dmd chairman of the house democratic caucus 
said a constitutional amendment is not necessary to many citizens 
and lawmakers who want to protect the flag 
if a statute will do it fine he said 
however bush and republican leaders on capitol hill contend that 
a law cannot overcome the supreme courts 54 ruling in june that 
burning the flag is a form of free speech protected by the 
constitution 
many democrats say a constitutional amendment would tinker 
dangerously with the bill of rights 
judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas predicted the 
new version would be approved by the court because it would outlaw 
the act of flagmutilation and not the intent of the offender 
republicans however say courts would quickly strike it down 
again 
we believe that this bill is insufficient to provide the 
protections that we seek and therefore continue to press for a 
constitutional amendment said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
this bill is flatly unconstitutional said rep james 
sensenbrenner rwis so all passing this bill has done is delay a 
vote on a constitutional amendment to protect the flag from 
burning he said acknowledging he was disappointed that only 21 
republicans joined him in voting against it 
rep chuck douglas rnh complained that the democratic bill 
was a sham this is the flagburner protection act of 1989 he 
said 
the bill sets penalties of up to a year in jail plus a fine for 
anyone who knowingly mutilates defaces burns or tramples upon a 
us flag it makes an exception for orderly disposal of wornout 
flags which is usually carried out by veterans groups by burning 
the legislation sent to the senate also sets a procedure for 
expedited court review of its constitutionality the next time a 
federal flagburning case comes along 
but the capitol hill showdown on the constitutional amendment 
probably will come before the statute if enacted is ever tested 
to help gain republican votes for the statute house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash promised supporters of the constitutional 
amendment the house will vote on the proposed amendment after the 
senate acts in october 
foley denied that scheduling a vote on the amendment a vote 
which it appeared earlier he intended to block was an 
acknowledgement that the democratic strategy was losing 
it might be taken exactly the opposite way he said as 
confidence in a vote to reject a constitutional amendment 
foley said the house democratic leadership still believes a 
constitutional amendment is unnecessary and such action should be 
avoided particularly in the sensitive area of the first 
amendment 
bushs presidential campaign included a stop at a flag factory 
and gop leaders consider the flag burning question a wedge issue 
which helps break apart democratic electoral strength

the bush administration facing tidal waves 
of complaints from the elderly said today it is exploring with 
members of congress possible ways to replace an unpopular surtax to 
finance catastrophic health insurance 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said administration 
officials are looking for ways to preserve the benefits of the 
program and maintain the financial aspects of it as well 
the administration is talking with congressional committee 
members about possible changes in the system that would mitigate the 
premium costs to certain categories of elder citizens he said 
referring to the highly unpopular surtax that if dropped without 
replacement revenue would push the federal budget deficit above the 
legally set ceiling 
as the senate finance committee searched tuesday for lastditch 
ways to prevent repeal of the program administration officials said 
a repeal is unacceptable because of the revenue loss it would cause 
the administration is listening and learning to what congress 
proposes in the way of alternatives to finance the insurance 
program said william diefenderfer iii deputy director of the 
office of management and budget 
the surtax paid by the wealthiest 40 percent of all retirees is 
the chief financing mechanism for the catastrophic insurance program 
enacted a year ago as an expansion of medicare 
bush supported the plan during his presidential campaign last 
year 
the administration thought it was a good program when it 
passed during the reagan administration said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
but now he said the political aspects of the program have 
become clear 
the elderly complaints are rolling in tidal waves of immense 
proportion fitzwater said we recognize the impact on the 
elderly we recognize their concern were working with congress 
searching for a way to mitigate the financial problems and save 
the program 
most of the complaints come from middle and upper income retirees 
who contend they are bearing most of the cost of the program and 
those who are covered by private insurance plans 
but diefenderfer said repeal of the entire program and the loss 
of its 4 billion to 7 billion in surtax revenue probably would 
force automatic spending cuts in other federal programs including 
those that benefit the elderly and needy americans 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said after a closeddoor session of the panel tuesday 
that there is no question in my mind that we are going to face an 
amendment on the senate floor to repeal catastrophic 
he said the committee is working to strip away all but basic 
elements of the program to reduce costs to the minimum this could 
lead to elimination of payments for prescription drugs and for 
skilled nursing care 
the house ways and means committee already has voted to reduce 
benefits and the two taxes that finance the program 
strong sentiment from house members for repeal was conveyed to 
bush on tuesday in a meeting with gop congressional leaders 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia said after the 
meeting that he had noted a dramatic shift in the 
administrations willingness to amend the program 
the senate finance committee agreed informally last week that the 
surtax would be cut significantly that the flat monthly premium 
would not be changed and that beneficiaries would have to pay a 
bigger share of expenses for drugs and doctors bills before 
reimbursement under the catastrophic care program begins 
everyone eligible for medicare is required to pay into the 
catastrophic care program about twothirds of the costs are paid by 
retirees who make enough to pay more than 150 a year in federal 
income taxes their surtax of up to 800 is 15 percent of their 
income taxes 
the remaining costs come from a flat 4 monthly premium paid by 
all but the poorest of the 33 million people eligible for medicare 
when catastrophic illness protection was enacted last year it 
was predicted to cost about 31 billion over five years the latest 
forecasts put that figure at 45 billion or more

gov michael s dukakis outlined a plan today to 
fight discrimination in mortgage lending including stricter 
enforcement 
the plan followed a report by the federal reserve bank of boston 
last month that documented racial patterns in lending 
the federal reserve bank study should be the concern of every 
fairminded citizen of massachusetts dukakis said the steps 
im announcing today will help guarantee that credit in the 
commonwealth is color blind 
the immediate steps announced by dukakis will target 
statechartered banks in boston and other urban areas for tougher 
evaluation of their compliance with a federal and state statute that 
requires banks to meet local credit needs 
it will also link compliance with the statute the community 
reinvestment act to all bank applications requiring the state 
banking divisions approval 
next week dukakis said he will ask the legislature to 
strengthen the power of state regulators to guard against 
discrimination in mortgage lending 
among other things the governors proposals would mandate 
participation by all lenders in a review board process that resolves 
disputes over the denial of mortgages and would add people from 
outside the industry to each board currently participation by 
lenders is voluntary 
the legislative package would also place mortgage companies 
brokers and all parties making five or more mortgage loans a year 
under the specific licensing and examination powers of the state 
division of banks 
the legislation would also open communityreinvestment 
evaluations to the public currently the law requires them to be 
kept confidential 
the federal reserve report found that that bostons black 
neighborhoods received 24 percent fewer home loans than white 
neighborhoods

the white house for president bushs signature 
among the funds appropriated for waste cleanup was 276 million 
to bring the hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash into

superconducting super collider a massive physics installation at 
which scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy 
the facility expected to cost 59 billion is to be built in ellis 
county texas 
the bush administration had requested 250 million for the 
project for 1990 but congress reduced the construction funds from 
160 million to 135 million while meeting the administrations 
requests for operating expenses and capital equipment

president bushs dealings with the changing 
communist world so far reflect a calculated caution and his 
nonmeeting meeting with soviet maverick boris yeltsin fits the mold 
ever the diplomat bush sought to avoid offending soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev by limiting his contact with the outspoken 
yeltsin here on a speaking tour of the united states 
instead of scheduling a meeting with yeltsin well known for his 
criticism of gorbachevs policies bush chose instead to drop by 
an ongoing meeting at the white house between yeltsin and bushs 
national security adviser brent scowcroft 
furthermore bush did it on tuesday shortly before he was to go 
on the air with his televised midday antidrug speech to us 
students 
that limited the time of bushs exposure to yeltsin to about 15 
minutes and gave bush something to talk about with him other than 
gorbachevs shortcomings 
thus the white house was able to put out a statement noting bush 
and yeltsin agreed drugs are major problem that touches on both 
american and soviet societies 
since yeltsins objective in coming to washington was clearly not 
to discuss drug policy the choreographed bush encounter enabled the 
president to wiggle out of getting involved in domestic soviet 
politics 
the us statement noted tersely that bush told yeltsin 
ussoviet relations are in good shape that americans back 
reforms in the soviet union and that the white house continues to 
enjoy a very positive relationship with gorbachev 
the white house did not allow reporters or photographers to 
attend the bushyeltsin session in a further effort to reduce it to 
a nonevent 
today presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater characterize the 
discussion as very general and philosophical 
asked about yeltsins criticism of gorbachev fitzwater said 
were sensitive to the progress thats being made on the soviet 
presidents reform initiatives we dont have any comment on any 
speculation on his relative strength 
on the decision of communistled hungary to open its borders to 
allow west germans to flee to austria en route to west germany 
fitzwater today gave another example of the caution that the 
administration has used in dealing with changes in the communist 
world 
we want to be supportive but keep a soft voice the 
spokesman said we have been supportive of hungarys steps to 
facilitate the refugees moving from east germany to west germany and 
other locations 
but he indicated the united states did not want to get itself 
involved in a policy dispute between hungary and east germany on the 
matter 
we dont want to speculate on other kinds of consequences it 
might be inflamatory or interpreted as internal meddling 
fitzwater said 
bush also showed extreme caution and efforts at balance in his 
earlier decisions and pronouncements on china the new government in 
poland and eastwest arms negotiations 
in his response to the bloody chinese government suppression of 
demonstrations in tiananmen square last spring bush who served as 
us envoy to beijing in the 1970s took a cautious middle ground 
while imposing some sanctions he stopped short of taking trade 
actions he said would hurt the chinese people and he sought to keep 
the lines of communication open with the government even as he 
denounced the bloodshed 
when a solidarity activist became polands new prime minister 
last month leading the first noncommunist government in the soviet 
bloc the president warmly congratulated the new leader tadeusz 
mazowiecki 
but at the same time he praised the leader of the old regime 
communist president wojciech jaruzelski for his statesmanship 
in cooperating with the new leadership 
and bushs response to nucleararms negotiations with the 
soviets particularly on the subject of nuclear warheads in europe 
was also calculated 
after a long period of study and delay the president finally 
came forth with a compromise proposal he unveiled at last mays nato 
summit in brussels one that eased a rift among nato allies 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the white 
house sought a way to receive yeltsin that balanced the diplomatic 
aspects of his visit with the political realities of his visit 
fitzwater suggested it would have been hard for bush to snub the 
soviet visitor 
after all the spokesman noted gorbachev met in moscow with sen 
alan cranston dcalif and other members of the opposition 
democratic party so there is some history or some precedent for 
a meeting like this 
still fitzwater said we didnt want to indicate that we were 
trying to provide a platform for dissent as it were

polished to a high shine by spy fiction but 
tarnished by reallife traitors british intelligence reportedly is 
planning to lift its blanket of secrecy 
if newspaper reports are correct the security service known as 
mi5 is about to go so far down the road of glasnost as to tell the 
public who its boss is 
it might not sound like much in an age when the head of the 
soviet kgb appears on television and assures legislators hes no 
longer bugging their homes 
the kgb went so far wednesday as to show a film to journalists 
the kgb today billed as the first documentary about the 
organization and slated for distribution both inside and outside the 
soviet union 
the film included looks at the interior of kgb headquarters in 
moscow and scenes of kgb martial arts training and target practice 
along with comments from kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov who 
portrayed the modern secret agent as a welleducated professional 
increasingly involved in fighting smuggling organized crime and 
drug trafficking 
but the changes described in the british press would be a 
revolution for mi5 whose very existence was not enshrined in law 
until this year it would mean goodbye to c and m and 
control as britains spymasters have become known through the 
novels of john le carre and ian fleming 
according to the newspapers mi5 wants to advertise openly for 
intelligence officers be listed in the telephone book and have its 
directorgeneral comment on public issues 
the government response to the reports has been less than 
glasnostic 
we never comment on such matters said a spokesman for the 
home office the department in charge of mi5 when asked about a 
recent frontpage report in the independent newspaper 
nevertheless the news reports have triggered lively debate 
the guardian suggested an mi5 job advertisement wanted 
intelligent men and women to work for the security service commonly 
known as mi5 under new management mi5 is an equal opportunity 
employer 
robert cecil a veteran diplomat attached to british intelligence 
in world war ii wrote in the independent that recruiting problems 
stem from politicians and journalists who persistently denigrate 
the secret services 
he also blamed fiction writers who portray secret agents as 
villains dupes or traitors adding can we wonder that young 
people do not flock to enlist in such ranks 
mi5s job is to catch terrorists subversives and spies operating 
in britain there has been no suggestion that its sister agency 
running overseas intelligence mi6 also will open its doors 
however most spy watchers believe britain eventually will step 
into line with its major englishspeaking intelligence partners the 
united states australia and canada 
a new security services act this year laid out a charter for mi5 
established a complaints tribunal and made wiretapping subject to 
ministerial approval but it stopped short of making the service 
accountable to parliament and made no mention of mi6 
cambridge university historian christopher andrew a leading 
expert on the secret services believes things will change only when 
prime minister margaret thatcher leaves office 
he attributes the secrecy more to victorian taboos than security 
considerations 
what is truly unbritish is to admit we have spies and the 
present prime minister is so imbued with victorian principles that 
she is no more likely to ask about british spies in public than she 
is to raise the subject of sex at dinner parties andrew said in 
an interview 
the newspapers identified the latest head of mi5 as patrick 
walker a career intelligence officer appointed a year ago who 
apparently cut his teeth tracking the irish republican army in 
northern ireland 
but no pictures have been published the most detailed 
description published without attribution in londons observer 
newspaper said walker is in his late 50s about 6 feet tall 
graying with a big nose and a not quite upperclass accent it 
didnt say where he went to school whether he is married plays 
golf or reads james bond thrillers 
walker himself wants a more public stance the papers say partly 
so that mi5 can claim some credit for its successes partly to 
dispel the public perception that it is rightwing and given to 
occasional illegalities 
the secret services could use better publicity the names of the 
traitors of the 1950s and 1960s kim philby guy burgess donald 
maclean linger and others have followed 
8ooervative tried 
to have the book banned

ptl continued giving jim bakker fat 
bonuses even while it was losing money the ministrys former 
finance director testified today 
were spending as if theres no crisis peter bailey the 
former finance director said in a 1984 memo to bakker and ptl 
executive vice president richard dortch who was indicted with 
bakker and pleaded guilty 
in november 1983 bailey testified he told bakker that 
contributions for that month totaled 47 million while expenditures 
were 68 million two weeks later prosecutor deborah smith said 
the board voted a 150000 bonus for jim and tammy bakker 
bailey testifying at bakkers fraud trial said he wrote in a 
march 1984 memo that every day brings us into a deeper crisis 
and that more than 700000 was needed to meet the payroll less 
than two weeks later records showed that bakker got a 390000 
bonus 
on tuesday a coal miners wife who gave 1000 of her husbands 
blacklung benefits for lodging at ptl said she was told there was 
no room at the inn where bakker luxuriated in a suite with 
goldplated swan bathroom fixtures 
i expected this to get a vacation every year for the rest 
of our lives that was what was sold to us sarah combs who has 
13 children and whose family lives on 400 a month testified at 
bakkers fraud trial 
also tuesday two former bakker advisers testified they warned 
the ptl founder he was risking legal troubles by taking too much 
money from the ministry high salaries taken by bakker and his 
relatives threatened ptls taxexempt status the former attorney 
and former accountant said 
the attorney john yorke said he sent a memo to his law firm 
boss citing concerns about 1983 wages earned by bakker and his wife 
tammy 
together jim and tammy have a monthly income of more than 
30000 he wrote jim has already received one bonus this year 
totaling 390000 he could possibly earn more than 1 million this 
year 
guy forcucci a certified public accountant who worked for ptl in 
the early 1980s and prepared bakkers tax returns testified he had 
warned bakker as early as 1982 about his high salary 
bakker is accused of diverting more than 37 million for his 
personal benefit from ptl which kept its taxexempt status as a 
religious organization until 1988 almost a year after bakker quit 
in a sex and money scandal 
prosecutors say bakker used his tv show to sell fraudulent 1000 
lifetime partnerships promising free lodging for a lifetime that 
ptl could not provide 
asked about bakkers decision to issue tens of thousands more 
partnerships than the 25000 he first announced yorke said he 
believes ptl was legally obliged to go back to the original 25000 
and tell them they had changed the terms and give them an 
opportunity to get their money back 
bakker made no such disclosure or offer according to previous 
testimony in the federal court trial 
jim didnt like to hear bad news yorke testified on 
several occasions when eddie got stern with him he turned around 
and wouldnt look at him 
prosecutor jerry miller asked how long bakker would refuse to 
look at knox yorke said until he left ptl hired new attorneys 
in 1986 
combs of spanishburg wva testified that she and her husband 
who has black lung disease bought their partnership in 1984 from 
her husbands 19000 disability fund but were unable to get hotel 
reservations at heritage usa 
every time i called i got somebody different and theyd give 
us a different reason why we couldnt get a reservation she said 
a glum bakker listened and scribbled notes as the jury watched a 
videotape of a 1986 tv pitch he made describing a lifetime 
partnership offer as magnificent wonderful and 
spectacular 
also testifying was interior decorator james taggart who was 
sentenced to 17 years in prison and fined 500000 last week for tax 
evasion while at ptl 
taggart described a videotape showing the 4000squarefoot suite 
often used by bakker and his family in the heritage grand hotel at 
the ptl ministrys heritage usa theme park near fort mill sc 
the decorator described goldplated swan bathroom fixtures 
antique beds and mirrored walls in the bedroom he said the suite 
included a 10by60foot closet for mrs bakker 
if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy bakker 
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than 5 
million

the lawyer for us district judge walter nixon 
told a senate impeachment trial committee today that the perjury 
case against the judge is illfounded because the judge never lied 
and had no reason to lie 
he is accused of lying to conceal his innocence defense 
attorney david stewart said in his closing statement to the 
12member committee that makes no sense it did not happen 
the case against nixon the imprisoned chief federal judge in 
mississippis southern district stems from statements he made to 
federal investigators and a grand jury about a marijuanasmuggling 
case involving the son of a businessman from whom he purchased 
lucrative oil properties 
nixon said tuesday that when he spoke to federal authorities and 
the grand jury he did not remember the conversations that have led 
to his conviction in federal court on perjury charges 
stewart said today that even if nixon had remembered them and 
told federal authorities the talks were not improper and would not 
have led to any charges against the judge 
he said the trial jury came to the wrong conclusion on the 
perjury indictments because it was distracted by an illegalgratuity 
charge that had no basis and on which nixon was acquitted 
the articles of impeachment accuse nixon of lying when he said he 
did not discuss or influence the case involving drew fairchild the 
50yearold son of wealthy oilman wiley fairchild 
but stewart said each of the witnesses that went before the 
senate committee denied that the talks they had with nixon were 
discussions about the case 
and the key witness county prosecutor paul bud holmes 
testified that the conversation he had with nixon did not influence 
how he handled the drew fairchild case 
on tuesday nixon said his conversations march 11 1983 about the 
drew fairchild case were such a nothing thing in my life and 
that after they were over he immediately forgot about them 
i had no intention to hide anything there was nothing to 
hide said nixon it has been blown up so much and magnified it 
amounted to nothing it resulted in nothing 
everything had been a misunderstanding i guess thats why i 
didnt remember it 
the judge called it one little day in my life involving a few 
minutes that were overshadowed by his docket of 1400 active 
cases worries over his wife recovering from oral surgery and the 
problems of raising seven children 
nixon said the conversations he had were not discussions of 
the fairchild case but only talk about fairchilds fear that he was 
being blackmailed by the prosecutor holmes handling his sons 
case 
the thrust of the whole case is that judge nixon does not 
recall and that is the reason for the statements that he made for 
which he is accused of perjury sen wyche fowler dga chairman 
impeachment trial committee said tuesday 
he said the committee would summarize the evidence for the full 
senate which he expects to hear the case sometime in october 
nixon 60 is serving a fiveyear prison sentence for perjury 
appointed by president lyndon johnson he is the lone democratic 
appointee among nine federal district judges in mississippi and 
will continue to collect his 89500 annual salary unless he dies 
resigns or is convicted of the impeachment charges voted unanimously 
by the house of representatives 
the articles of impeachment approved unanimously by the house 
allege that nixon 
lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case 
against drew fairchild with holmes 
lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do officially 
or unofficially with the fairchild case and never influenced anyone 
in the case 
undermined the integrity of the judiciary and disobeyed the 
law by making 14 false or misleading statements during an interview 
with the federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury testimony

an english firm could be charged with 
cruelty to animals after 79 beagles suffocated on a ferry from 
england to sweden police said wednesday 
passengers appealed to the ships crew to find out why the dogs 
were crying but nothing was done 
bengt inaeus a detective in sodertalje south of stockholm said 
100 beagles were put in a van on the ferry from harwich to the 
swedish port of goteborg on sept 6 
the swedish pharmaceutical company astra planned to use the dogs 
obtained from a kennel in england to test drugs inaeus said when a 
kennel worker went to check on the dogs after six hours 79 were 
dead 
astra spokesman staffan tarnby said the dogs suffocated probably 
because of a failure in the vans air supply system 
neither inaeus nor tarnby would identify the kennel or its 
english transport firm 
there were other animals on the ferry and none of them died 
inaeus said so we cant blame the general conditions on the 
vessel

salvadoran rebels today proposed a ceasefire 
in their countrys decadeold civil war prosecution of human rights 
violators and reduction of the armed forces 
rebel leaders made public their proposals at a news conference 
moments before renewing talks in mexico city with representatives of 
president alfredo cristianis rightist administration 
but both sides said they had scant hope of negotiating an early 
end to the war which has cost more than 70000 lives three 
previous attempts to negotiate peace from 1984 to 1987 ended in 
deadlock 
joaquin villalobos a top leader of the leftist faradundo marti 
national liberation front guerrillas and seven other rebel chiefs 
distributed a document outlining their proposals which they said 
they will present to the government 
the rebels called for a negotiated ceasefire by nov 15 at the 
latest but said it must be accompanied by the reforms this 
implies great risks for the rebels villalobos said 
he said the salvadoran people are tired of fighting and we are 
conscious the war has to end 
the proposals called for a un observer team to monitor an end 
to political repression constitutional and land reforms and talks 
to advance the 1991 legislative and municipal elections 
also proposed was the creation of a new supreme court the rebels 
consider the present court dominated by rightists 
villalobos said the rebels plan to integrate itself into the 
countrys civil and political life gradually as the reforms are 
being carried out 
there was no immediate public response from the salvadoran 
government 
the previous negotiations were held during the centrist 
administration of christian democrat jose napoleon duarte 
when he took office june 1 cristiani invited the guerrillas to 
lay down their arms and engage in talks with his administration the 
rebels and government have called a temporary ceasefire for the 
peace talks 
the rebels contend that despite regular elections since 1982 el 
salvador has only a democratic veneer they say civil liberties are 
systematically violated and that citizens risk their lives by 
publicly supporting socialism 
human rights groups say most victims of the war were killed by 
rightist death squads from 1979 to 1984 they say such slayings have 
diminished considerably but not ceased 
rebels say the 56000member armed forces should reduced as the 
war ends and they demand that rightists be weeded out

us commerce secretary robert mosbacher called 
wednesday for structural changes in japans economy and fewer trade 
barriers to allow the united states to compete with japan and to 
benefit japanese consumers 
the plight of japanese consumers who pay among the highest 
prices in the world for housing and food results directly from the 
countrys closed market mosbacher said 
all were doing is asking for the right to come here and 
compete he told reporters during a 15day trip to asia and 
eastern europe 
aides traveling with mosbacher said his meetings wednesday with 
officials of the posts and telecommunications ministry produced 
nonresponses to a number of concerns of the united states 
among them access to the market for satellites digital switching 
equipment and optical fibers 
mosbacher also joined a governmentsponsored meeting of 83 
foreign companies doing business in japan it was the first in a 
series of forums meant to expand imports 
hikaru matsunaga japans minister of international trade and 
industry told the group that imports rose 113 percent in the first 
half of 1989 
mosbacher acknowledged several areas in which japan voluntarily 
has limited its exports to the united states steel textiles 
semiconductors and machine tools but he said these are the 
exception 
the united states is the largest and the most open market in 
the world and unfortunately japan is among the most closed he 
said 
he said the 52 billion us merchandise trade deficit with japan 
last year was still far too high but noted it had declined 32 
percent from its peak in the third quarter of 1987 
mosbacher said the united states is working to reduce its federal 
budget deficit increase domestic savings to lower the cost of 
capital and emphasize longterm business planning 
but he asked japan to produce urgently some made in japan 
solutions to the problems its exportled economic success has caused 
the united states he said for instance a less cumbersome 
distribution system in japan would lower prices 
japan which had a june unemployment rate of 22 percent says 
paring its distribution system would eliminate many jobs 
in response to criticism that the united states is pushing japan 
to fundamentally change its way of life to boost us 
competitiveness here mosbacher said when your culture affects 
the rest of the world it might be time to temper it 
the individual entrepreneur is part of our genius but we have 
to temper that to some degree because of the challenge of 
competition abroad he said japan might want to consider this 
in the same way

wilma smith is unhappy with the notoriety her 
home has gained as a result of the hud scandals in washington and 
she has a simple wish 
i hope they finish this thing up with hud so everyone can get 
back to being a happy family says mrs smith 54 who has lived 
for nearly two years at the durham hosiery mill housing project 
ella holeman another resident praises her home at the 
renovated turn of the century factory as safe 
but it isnt questions of security or comfort that interest 
investigators in washington its political influence 
the mill project has become a symbol of influence peddling at the 
department of housing and urban development during the reagan era 
and is expected to be discussed prominently friday when 
congressional hearings resume with the scheduled testimony of former 
secretary samuel pierce 
pierce in may told congress he played no major role in hud 
funding decisions but shortly afterward a former deputy shirley 
wiseman said her boss personally ordered the north carolina project 
funded over the objections of several agency experts ms wiseman 
also disclosed that the citys thenmayor who lobbied hud for the 
funding was a former law partner of pierces other locally 
prominent republicans became involved in shepherding the project to 
approval 
since the disclosures pierce has been publicly linked to a 
number of other hud funding decisions all within his legal 
authority 
in an interview published this week the former secretary 
acknowledged approving the 15 million durham project which opened 
in november 1987 
occasionally you have to step in an overrule your staff he 
told time magazine that durham project was a great success 
critics question the wisdom of turning the mill into lowincome 
housing because it is near railroad tracks and on a site believed to 
be contaminated by toxic wastes but mrs smith and her fellow 
tenants agree with pierce 
the four buildings of the complex have been connected with 
glassenclosed walkways all of the apartments are carpeted and 
include private bathrooms kitchens and combination livingdining 
areas the complex also features a recreation room a readingtv 
room and laundry areas 
i love the environment said christine gooch 50 who has 
lived at the project for a year its convenient to the bus stop 
grocery stores and downtown 
i like everything about it said rubin johnson 69 who moved 
to the hosiery mill five months ago i feel very safe here 
the mill built in 1902 employed about 1000 people in its 
owners heyday as the worlds largest supplier of cotton hosiery 
the mill shut down in 1936 and in 1978 was placed on the national 
register of historic places 
hud records show the mill project which was developed by john l 
allen of myersonallen co inc of boston languished in financial 
trouble for six years winning hud funding only after allen hired 
two republican consultants 
one was lou kitchin the southeastern political director for the 
reagan and bush presidential campaigns he received 25000 city 
records show allen also paid 12000 to gop state rep harold j 
brubaker 
kitchin said he did not take advantage of his political ties and 
only helped allen put his hud proposal together brubaker said his 
role was to bring allen and kitchin together and he collected only 
airfare and expenses for his work 
thenmayor charles markham also lobbied hud markham and pierce 
practiced at the same law firm in the 1960s 
we are not social friends markham said in a recent 
interview my contacts with him in the last 24 years have been 
very infrequent and very casual 
markham wrote several letters to hud and met with pierces top 
aide deborah gore dean to seek support for the project 
these conversations were for us to set out why we felt this 
project would be good for durham markham said i still think 
its a good project 
still the controversy surrounding the project prompted its 
managers to send residents a memo this summer assuring them they 
didnt have to worry about it closing 
our concern is that residents will misunderstand said janice 
daley a regional manager for myersonallen weve been kind of 
quelling the rumors and doing the best we can we said nobody is 
going to make you move 
ms daley said the complex has been full since spring the 174 
lowincome elderly and disabled people occupy one and twobedroom 
and efficiency apartments 
residents dont care about the political controversy they prefer 
to talk about safety and camaraderie 
the living conditions are good said ms holeman if 
somebody is not around we have somebody to check on you we have a 
sick committee 
mrs smith still wishes the attention would pass saying some 
residents remain worried about their future 
some people dont understand what they read said mrs smith 
head of the tenant association i feel like somebody is ballooning 
things out of proportion please let us live in peace

archeologists digging just three blocks from 
the white house have unearthed thousands of relics from washingtons 
notorious old redlight district where civil war prostitutes earned 
their nickname entertaining gen joseph hookers troops 
shoveling beneath an asphalt parking lot just south of 
pennsylvania avenue in the shadow of the commerce department this 
summer investigators found perfume bottles gaudy buttons costume 
jewelry garter hooks and a longforgotten cellar full of whiskey 
and beer bottles 
there was even a tiny antique bromo seltzer bottle for treating 
a morningafter malaise 
besides these artifacts of the hookers trade the investigators 
discovered a wide assortment of everyday objects left by common 
laborers immigrants runaway slaves and other poor folk who once 
inhabited the crimeridden neighborhood known as murder bay in 
the mid19th century 
the sixweek dig was completed just before labor day experts 
have begun the yearlong task of cleaning cataloging and analyzing 
the more than 250000 objects recovered from the downtown site for 
clues to the lifestyle of the humble people who lived there more 
than a century ago 
nobody famous lived here theres no george washington slept 
here said donna seifert principal archeologist with john milner 
associates inc a historic preservation firm based in west chester 
pa which conducted the dig 
these were ordinary working folk and this is one of those rare 
opportunities to learn more about what their lives were really 
like she said 
they lived in a hotbed of vice gambling and rum running in a 
squalid community of row houses and alley shanties between 14th and 
13th streets across pennsylvania avenue from the national theater 
and some of washingtons fanciest hotels and offices 
hooker the union commander defending the capital against 
confederate forces tried to control the army of prostitutes 
following his troops by herding the women into murder bay away from 
his encampment outside the city the district became known as 
hookers division and its ladies of the night took the name of 
hookers 
a newspaper article from the 1890s which ms seifert acquired 
from the library of congress declared that the area was the 
plague spot of washington with 109 brothels and 50 saloons 
grover cleveland can sit in his bedroom window at the white 
house and survey this entire territory the paper said he is 
within sight and gunshot of each of these 109 dens which defy the 
laws which he is supposed to execute through his commissioners 
the prostitutes packed their bags when congress outlawed brothels 
in the district of columbia in 1914 and the site was razed in the 
late 1920s plans to build a monumental plaza were abandoned in the 
depression and the area was paved over in 1931 to create a 
1300car parking lot 
construction is expected to begin in the fall of 1990 on a 
multimilliondollar federal office building and international 
cultural and arts center at the site 
because government funds are involved the developer the 
pennsylvania avenue development corp is required by the 1966 
national historic preservation act to review the project for its 
impact on cultural resources 
the archeologists hired for the job consulted old maps census 
records and city directories and began excavating in midjuly in 
their search for backyard trash pits behind the former wooden 
and brick rowhouses 
they uncovered an old cellar from a rooming house whose boarders 
included several prostitutes and salvaged about 200 empty beer and 
liquor bottles among the popular brands a century ago were pabst 
milwaukee schlitz and john fitzmorris old berwick rye plus 
several earthenware jugs of germanbrand ginger beer 
also found were fish chicken and steak bones many dating back 
to the civil war 
ms seifert says these and other mundane objects uncovered will 
yield valuable information about the denizens of the former gambling 
dens saloons brothels and boarding houses what they ate and 
drank what clothing they wore how they spent their leisure time 
we know how thomas jefferson set his table at monticello and 
who his guests were for example but we dont know very much about 
the everyday dining habits of the ordinary people who lived in 
washington she said 
the documents tell us nothing about how they lived and these 
people did not save and cherish their household items as the 
wealthy did they were used until they were broken or worn out and 
then thrown away

an ethics probe of mayor tom bradley today 
found insufficient evidence he broke any criminal laws but the 
probe cited financialdisclosure violations that could result in a 
reported 22 million in civil fines 
city attorney james hahn filed a lawsuit containing the 
financialdisclosure allegations at the same time he released a 
1600page report on his fivemonth probe 
the investigation was prompted by conflictofinterest questions 
about the mayors role as a paid adviser to two banks that did 
business with the city far east national bank and valley federal 
savings and loan association 
either no evidence exists or insufficient evidence exists 
depending on the particular transaction or interest involved to 
prove actual violations of law by the mayor the city attorney 
concluded 
nevertheless hahn was critical of the fiveterm mayors ethical 
conduct and his handling of his personal finances 
while the mayors employment by far east national bank may in 
and of itself been legal it nevertheless served to diminish the 
prestige of his office the mayor should be answerable only to the 
citizens of the city and to no other employer hahn said 
bradley scheduled a news conference later in the day to respond 
to the report 
hahns suit alleges bradley intentionally or negligently failed 
to report six investments involving hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in such companies as la gear metromedia inc and trans world 
airlines 
violations of state financialdisclosure laws dont carry any 
criminal penalties but can result in fines 
the lawsuit does not specify the penalties sought by the city 
attorney however the los angeles times today reported that fines 
stemming from more than 100 errors in financial disclosure documents 
could reach 22 million 
bradley was paid 18000 as a consultant to the far east bank but 
returned the money when news media attention fell on the case 
hahn said it was apparent that a march telephone call from 
bradley to city treasurer leonard rittenberg did influence 
rittenberg to deposit 2 million in city funds with far east but 
both bradley and rittenberg denied any intent to influence and hahn 
said investigators found insufficient evidence to warrant charges 
bradley is still under investigation by the federal government 
for his investments and relationship with indicted junk bond king 
michael milken 
anticipating the report city councilman nate holden said it 
should send a strong message regarding the conduct of public 
officials 
i would hope city hall is changed forever said holden who 
lost a bid to stop bradley from winning an unprecedented fifth term 
earlier this year

nations waging the war on drugs will get a 
powerful new weapon if enough countries approve a proposed un 
treaty for controlling the flow of illegal narcotics a un 
official said wednesday 
the international treaty has been signed by 71 nations including 
the united states soviet union and colombia but has been ratified 
so far only by the bahamas and china 
i hope the convention will come into force by early next year 
pending its ratification by at least 20 nations said margaret j 
anstee directorgeneral of the un office in vienna where a un 
conference on drugs opened monday 
the treaty calls for extradition of accused drug traffickers and 
the exchange of law enforcement information it also lifts bank 
secrecy provisions to aid authorities in tracking money laundering 
mandates that commercial carriers ensure their cargoes are free of 
drugs and requires supervision of the production and sale of 
chemicals used in the manufacture of illegal drugs 
it also has provisions that allow governments to seize assets of 
drug traffickers 
the legislatures of at least 20 nations must ratify the 
convention for it to go into effect in the united states the 
treaty is pending in the senate 
ms anstee said the proposed un convention against illicit 
traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which was 
signed in vienna in december would provide a powerful weapon to 
combat drug abuse 
these countries have to readjust their laws to comply with the 
conventions requirements and that takes a little time she said 
in an interview during the drug conference 
the fiveday conference has been dominated by developments in 
colombia where the government is waging a nationwide crackdown on 
its powerful cocaine cartels 
ms anstee said the conference would result in a resolution 
supporting the colombian government delegates from nearly 100 
nations are attending

quadrature festivalgoers had already kicked some of the boxes 
all over the piedmont park hill where they sat 
it was the first time in the festivals 36year history that a

fail said pat gann the festivals executive director this is 
worse

david dinkins said today his strong showing among 
white voters in a democratic primary that ended the 12year era of 
brash and combative ed koch positions him well to become new york 
citys first black mayor 
the manhattan borough president will face former federal 
prosecutor rudolph giuliani who thrashed cosmetics heir ronald 
lauder in the republican primary tuesday 
you the people of new york made history today and i promise 
you i shall never let you down dinkins the first black to win a 
major party nomination in new york city told cheering supporters 
dinkins received 537313 votes or 51 percent to 445816 or 42 
percent for koch in the fourcandidate race in this democratic 
stronghold the victor took more than 90 percent of the black vote 
half the hispanic vote and about 30 percent of the white vote by 
comparison the rev jesse jackson won 17 percent of the white vote 
in the 1988 democratic presidential primary 
i can indeed reach beyond my base dinkins said this morning 
on the cbs program this morning victory with just 
africanamerican and latinos that would not be a good thing for the 
city 
he won it fairly squarely and by a large margin koch told 
supporters i am ready to serve to help him become the next 
mayor 
giuliani seeking to become the first republican elected mayor 
since 1965 got 75720 votes or 67 percent to 36905 or 33 
percent for lauder whose record 12 million in campaign spending 
went mostly for negative television commercials 
i want to bring new life into new york city new blood new 
heart new people and make this again the magical city that it once 
was said giuliani who also will be on the liberal party and 
independent fusion lines 
lauder a former ambassador to austria will remain on the nov 7 
ballot as the conservative partys nominee 
the other democratic candidates trailed far behind dinkins and 
koch former transit chief richard ravitch had 48289 votes or 5 
percent and comptroller harrison j goldin had 28790 or 3 percent 
at a city hall rally today before 3000 people koch called for 
democratic unity against giuliani 
a new campaign has begun and now is the time for supporters of 
david dinkins ed koch dick ravitch and jay goldin to join hands 
and join forces in a unified campaign to ensure victory for david 
dinkins this fall koch said 
dinkins asked the crowd have we scraped and struggled to 
survive nine years of reactionary republican government in 
washington just to hand over our city to the very same forces 
no the crowd shouted back 
koch the loudmouthed symbol of new york to much of america 
first won election as a long shot in 1977 while the city was in the 
throes of a fiscal crisis he was reelected twice by huge margins 
but the citys mood shifted away from his brash style as aids 
drugs homelessness crime and other urban ills seemed to demand a 
milder touch the calm deliberative dinkins projected that image 
the campaign drama heightened in the last weeks after a black 
youth was slain in an attack by a white gang heating up simmering 
racial tensions 
dinkins said the killing was an example of the hatred koch had 
not addressed koch was criticized for suggesting that marchers 
protesting the killings were making things worse 
koch forcing a smile tuesday night said ive had 12 glorious 
years as mayor koch said 
but he reminded the crowd youll have me from now to december 
31st i do not intend to keep my mouth shut 
dinkins quieted his supporters when they booed at the mention of 
koch 
oh no oh no were all together now said dinkins joined 
at the podium by jesse jackson remember me im the guy that 
brings people together 
with your help i intend to be a mayor who leads a new era of 
change a mayor who sets and pursues a new standard of integrity 
dinkins said i intend to be a mayor who restores a new rule of 
law in our streets in our schools and in our subways 
giuliani gained fame as us attorney by prosecuting wall street 
cheats corrupt politicians and mobsters 
his multiparty candidacy is reminiscent of the citys last 
republican mayor john lindsay but giuliani preferred to compare 
himself to the legendary fiorello laguardia mayor from 1934 to 1945 
he united all new yorkers giuliani said laguardia was a 
republican like i am a republican who reaches out for the support 
of others of democrats and liberals of conservatives and 
independents

more than 20000 peaceful 
protesters sang songs of freedom and waved banners denouncing police 
brutality on wednesday in the biggest antigovernment march ever 
permitted in this country 
police stayed out of sight as marchers led by black leaders and 
cape towns white mayor clogged a milelong route leading from st 
georges anglican cathedral to city hall 
organizers described the march as a historic occurrence in this 
racially divided nation 
we have scored a great victory for justice and peace 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu told a crowd of 1800 black white 
and mixedrace marchers who packed city hall while thousands of 
others stood outside 
he said acting president fw de klerk should have been present 
to see what this country is going to become a technicolor 
country 
the absence of police contrasted sharply with protest marches two 
weeks ago in cape town that were broken up by riot squads using 
whips batons and a water cannon that sprayed purple water 
it is important to know we could have this peaceful march 
toward our freedom said the rev frank chikane secretarygeneral 
of the south african council of churches once that has started 
today no one can ever stop it again 
protest demonstrations normally are illegal in south africa and 
the cape town police commander maj gen phillipus fourie said 
last week he would stop wednesdays march but de klerk announced 
tuesday evening that the protest could proceed because he had been 
assured it would be peaceful 
the farright conservative party the largest white opposition 
group in parliament said wednesday that approval of the march was 
capitulation to radicals 
an antiapartheid lawyer dullah omar praised the marchers for 
maintaining discipline 
what you have done is to prove that when the police are not 
here when the batons and the whips and the tear gas is not 
around then there is no violence he said 
after singing we shall overcome jubilant marchers set off 
from st georges behind tutu mayor gordon oliver and the rev 
allan boesak president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
youths chanted freedom songs and waved banners that said peace 
in our city and stop killing our pople 
at city hall those unable to fit inside stood in a parking lot 
waiting for speakers to emerge 
tutu and other activists have denounced the use of force against 
peaceful protesters during a 6weekold campaign to defy apartheid 
laws that deny the black majority a voice in national affairs they 
have said police were responsible for the deaths of at least 23 
people in cape towns black and mixedrace townships during protests 
of the sept 6 parliamentary elections which excluded blacks 
police defended their actions as necessary to prevent 
intimidation of voters they said 15 people died most in clashes 
not involving policemen 
oliver and tutu received standing ovations inside city hall and 
youths lauded the mayor in a chant usually used to honor leaders of 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
today we all have the freedom of the city oliver said 
at the close of the rally tutu asked the crowd to stand link 
hands and chant we are unstoppable 
as the marchers assembled a new session of parliament began at 
the parliamentary complex near st georges the electoral college 
controlled by the national party is expected to elect de klerk to a 
fiveyear term thursday 
since the election in which his national party lost a quarter of 
its parliamentary seats de klerk has indicated he is prepared to 
allow forms of peaceful protest that have been prohibited in the 
past 
he said tuesday he wants to persuade black leaders to join in 
negotiating a new constitution in which blacks would gain political 
rights 
de klerk expressed sympathy for the families of people killed on 
election night but said police had to act because militants were 
violently preventing people from voting he said action would be 
taken against policemen found to have used excessive force 
the government announced tuesday that maj gen jaap joubert a 
senior police investigator had been appointed to lead a probe into 
the allegations of police violence 
south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

the pilot of an american airlines jetliner 
reported hydraulicsystem trouble before the plane skidded off a 
runway at ohare airport but airline officials said today they 
dont know if the problem was anything more than a faulty warning 
light 
two of 113 people aboard tuesday afternoon suffered minor 
injuries while evacuating down emergency chutes american spokesman 
thomas stack said 
ambulances and firefighting equipment were standing by near the 
runway during the landing 
the plane from rochester ny landed normally but then for 
reasons that were not immediately clear skidded off the runway 
american spokesman al becker said today he said the nose gear 
collapsed as the plane left the pavement there was no fire 
before landing the pilot had radioed about a problem he 
mentioned hydraulic problems becker said 
it may have just been a warning light he said weve 
really got to investigate today to know 
passenger andre ruzycki said passengers applauded the pilot after 
the plane came to rest 
it was no worse than any rollercoaster ride really said 
ruzycki no one was really aware of anything until we touched 
down we werent told anything until we were being evacuated and 
told to get off the plane quickly 
federal aviation administration spokesman mort edelstein said the 
faa and the national transportation safety board would inspect the 
plane 
the plane was a twoengine md80 which is essentially a dc9 
redesigned for noise reduction edelstein said becker didnt know 
how old the aircraft is but said the md80s are no more than five 
years old 
edelstein said the plane had been scheduled to fly on to salt 
lake city after a stop in chicago 
the pilot reported hydraulic system problems as he was coming

colt firearms division said a ruling that 
it rehire 800 strikers with back pay could cost the gunmaker less 
than 16 million not the 40 million estimated by the union 
an administrative law judge martin roth said in a ruling 
released monday that colt had engaged in dozens of unfair labor 
practices during the 3yearold strike and he ordered the workers 
reinstatement 
the united auto workers and colt said tuesday it was too early to 
say whether they would appeal the ruling to the national labor 
relations board 
colt industries spokesman michael dunn on tuesday estimated the 
companys total liability at less than 6 million he declined to 
say how the company arrived at the figure 
robert madore a regional official with the uaw stuck by his 
estimate that the back wages totaled 40 million or an average of 
50000 per worker 
i dont know how they come up with their figure madore said 
i think theyre going to have to sharpen their pencil 
madore speculated that the discrepancy stemmed from a company 
offer at some point during the strike to let 50 strikers return to 
work roths ruling said the company must pay back wages to strikers 
to the date of a valid offer of reinstatement 
if they have 50 job openings and they offer 50 jobs to 800 
workers does that stop the back pay it cant realistically 
madore said

tobacco state lawmakers vowed wednesday to 
grind the senate to a procedural crawl unless attempts to ban 
smoking on all airline flights are dropped but their unbowed 
opponents said they welcomed a showdown 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine planned a vote 
for thursday on whether to block a filibuster by cigarette industry 
supporters the filibuster unlimited debate in hopes of preventing 
a vote is aimed at killing legislation by sen frank lautenberg 
dnj expanding current airline smoking restrictions to all 
domestic flights 
the maneuvering came as outgoing surgeon general c everett koop 
told a congressional hearing that minors should be forbidden from 
buying cigarettes from vending machines 
koop who leaves his job this month said federal legislation was 
needed because 43 states have laws banning tobacco sales to minors 
but dont enforce them 
in the senate fight over airline smoking tobacco state senators 
said they would accept a permanent version of the current smoking 
ban on twohour airline flights but mitchell scheduled the vote 
after ban opponents said they would try to block the senates work 
unless advocates of tougher restrictions dropped their efforts 
lautenberg said he would press his legislation saying we 
wont succumb to threats 
sen wendell ford dky said tobacco senators would accept 
language the permanent ban on twohour flights which the house 
passed aug 3 the restriction effects fourfifths of all flights 
but he said unless smoking opponents accepted his offer he would 
slow consideration of the 119 billion transportation spending bill 
for next year that contains the cigarette restrictions 
this one will take basically a week to get through he said 
of the transportation measure one of 13 spending bills 
congressional leaders want to complete by the oct 1 start of fiscal 
1990 
theres more at stake here i think than just the question of 
smoking on airliners he said its a question of the budget so 
the rest of the world can work 
sen jesse helms rnc said any delays would be lautenbergs 
fault for inserting the restrictions into the bill in the first 
place 
he may end up rolling us but he will know that he has been in 
a fight he said 
helms said his state the nations leading tobacco producer 
has 30000 tobacco growers to whom i have made a commitment that 
id protect their interests as long as im in the united states 
senate and im going to do that 
lautenberg asked his opponents to drop their efforts 
if they have a case to make they ought to make it and let us 
vote on it he said but that is not likely to happen well 
endure 
airline employees and health groups have pressed for a total 
smoking ban on aircraft claiming that cigarette fumes can cause 
cancer and other diseases for everyone aboard a flight 
tobacco interests say theres been no proof that the smoke 
endangers nonsmokers and argue that there are plenty of other 
chemicals soiling recirculated aircraft cabin air 
across capitol hill koop told the house energy and commerce 
transportation subcommittee that giving youngsters easy access to 
cigarettes was comparable to letting them purchase alcohol simply 
because they had the money in their pockets 
there is no logical reason why we should have a double standard 
for controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol the two major legal 
addicting drugs used in our society he told a congressional 
hearing 
the tobacco institute the cigarette industrys trade group has 
said 80 percent of cigarette machines are located where teenagers 
do not congregate 
but koop said that still leaves enough machines to justify 
federal action 
even 20 percent of the 374000 vending machines in the united 
states represents a huge number of sites from which teenagers can 
readily obtain cigarettes illegally koop said

a senate subcommittee on wednesday approved a 
77 billion spending bill that would eliminate president bushs 
request for military construction in the philippines and make a 
drastic cut in funds for south korea 
by voice vote the senate appropriations subcommittee on military 
construction approved a spending bill that is 13 billion below the 
funding level for fiscal 1989 and about 300 million less than 
bushs request for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
this is an 18 percent reduction in real terms from last years 
military construction budget said sen james sasser dtenn 
chairman of the subcommittee this is appropriate considering the 
budget deficit 
specifically the bill eliminates the 408 million bush 
requested for such construction items in the philippines as 
dormitories at clark air base storage facilities and maintenance 
shops 
the house in its bill approved 61 million for military 
construction in the philippines 
the senate subcommittee adhering to earlier action in the senate 
authorization bill also eliminated the 354 million for family 
housing in the philippines 
bushs request of 863 million for military construction in 
south korea was cut by 855 million largely affecting the 
facilities at the osan air base the senate authorization bill 
approved 669 million for construction in south korea while the 
house adopted legislation earmarking 742 million for korean 
construction 
its a question of how long military forces will be in korea 
sasser said in the philippines there will be a renegotiation of 
base rights 
under the philippines constitution the country must negotiate a 
new agreement with the united states on the location of clark air 
base and subic bay naval base and the continued presence of us 
forces 
while cutting money for overseas projects the subcommittee added 
250 million to the bill for national guard and reserves in the 
united states bush had requested 4526 million 
the subcommitte also cut 50 million from the presidents request 
of 1015 million for housing the b2 stealth bomber at the whiteman 
air force base in missouri the reduction mirrors the action taken 
in the authorization bill and reflects the delay in the program 
the full appropriations committee is expected to vote on the 
subcommittee bill on thursday once passed by the full senate 
members of the house and senate will meet in conference to hammer 
out a final version

a plan to fight discrimination in mortgage lending 
including expanded enforcement and new legislation to give 
regulators more powers was announced wednesday by gov michael s 
dukakis 
the steps im announcing today will help guarantee that credit 
in the commonwealth is color blind he said 
the plan follows a report by the federal reserve bank of boston 
documenting that race has been a factor in home mortgage lending in 
boston the report said lenders were functioning in a way that 
hurts black neighborhoods 
the federal reserve bank study should be the concern of every 
fairminded citizen of massachusetts dukakis said 
the programs first steps will provide tougher evaluations of 
statechartered banks in boston and other urban areas on their 
compliance with the federal community reinvestment act it also will 
link community reinvestment act performance to all bank applications 
requiring the state banking divisions approval 
next week dukakis said he will ask the legislature to approve 
several proposals to strengthen the power of state regulators to 
assure there is no discrimination in mortgage lending 
the governors proposals would require mandatory participation in 
a mortgage review board process by all lenders in the state and 
expand the size and diversity of the four regional boards by 
including a member of the public the program now is limited to 
lenders that voluntarily agree to participate 
the boards have the authority to review mortgages to make sure 
there is no geographic discrimination in lending practices 
the legislative package would also place mortgage companies 
mortgage brokers and all parties making five or more mortgage loans 
a year under the specific licensing and examination powers of the 
division of banks 
mortgage companies a fastgrowing segment of the financial 
services industries now are not regulated by the state consumer 
affairs secretary mary ann walsh has made their regulation a 
priority issue on her legislative agenda 
the dukakis legislative package also would make community 
reinvestment evaluations public records now the law requires them 
to be kept confidential 
in addition dukakis said an interstate banking bill already 
pending in the legislature would require outofstate banks buying 
instate banks to make available assets to support affordable 
housing programs 
massachusetts now has a reciprocal agreement with other new 
england states on interstate banking but does not allow other 
outofstate banks to enter the state 
state banking commissioner andrew j calamare said the measures 
announced wednesday would enhance the ability of his division to 
assure the credit needs of low and moderate income people are met 
he said the division in the past 2 years already has cited 14 
boston statechartered banks for inadequate performance 
according to the banking division there are 42 statechartered 
banks in the boston area and a total of 294 in the state

more people than ever are living in the small 
towns distant suburbs and farms that make up rural america the 
government reported wednesday 
about 648 million people or 25 percent of the us population 
lived in rural areas in 1988 an increase of more than 900000 from 
1987 the total included approximately 495 million living on farms 
or 2 percent of the population a decrease of 35000 from the 
previous year 
the report was prepared by the agriculture and commerce 
departments using estimates from the census bureaus monthly current 
population survey 
since 1986 when a new system of counting noses in the 
countryside began the rural population has grown more rapidly than 
the urban population averaging 264 percent compared with 167 
percent 
the 1988 farm population estimate of 4951000 is not 
significantly different from the 1987 estimate which may reflect a 
leveling off in the longterm decline in the number of farm 
residents the report said 
one of the reports authors judith kalbacher of the usdas 
economic research service said the rural figures overall have shown 
significant changes but cautioned that the growth pattern since 1986 
may be illusory 
when the urban areas are redefined after the 1990 census some 
of these growing rural areas will be reclassified as urban she 
said in a telephone interview some of the growing areas are going 
to be taken out of rural groups and that will make it look like 
there was less rural growth than is now being reported 
as used in the report rural areas include open countryside and 
place of fewer than 2500 people that are not in the suburbs of 
large cities large cities and their suburbs plus places of 2500 
or more are considered urban 
the farm population consists of people living on farms in rural 
areas but does not include the relatively few who live on farms in 
urban areas the report said a farm is defined as a place that sold 
agricultural products worth 1000 or more in the previous year 
kalbacher said urban sprawl and a willingness of city workers to 
commute greater distances have been important factors in the rural 
growth families moving to distant suburbs for example have helped 
boost the annual counts for rural areas 
it probably means that a lot of the rural growth that were 
seeing in the middecade of the 1980s is mostly fringe development 
around urbanized areas she said 
the report said that the largest share of the rural population 
44 percent is in the south which has been the case since the 
first census was taken in 1790 little change in the regional 
distribution of rural people has occurred in the last 40 years 
the farm population however has shown marked change over 
the same period in 1950 for example the south accounted for 516 
percent of farm people but only 296 percent in 1988 the midwest 
meanwhile accounted for 506 percent last year compared with 323 
percent in 1950 
other observations in the report included 
farm residents are older with a median age of 38 years in 1988 
compared with 322 years for all nonfarm people in 1920 the 
median age of farm people was less than 21 years a median age means 
half of the people are older half younger nonfarm refers to urban 
plus rural nonfarm people 
last year 971 percent of farm residents were white and 22 
percent were black compared with 842 percent white and 124 
percent black in the nonfarm population the remainder were 
described as other races 
only 28 percent of the farm residents were hispanic 
about 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were 
married and living with a spouse in 1988 compared with 56 percent 
of the nonfarm people

israels minister of industry and trade ariel 
sharon said wednesday that israel should remove plo leader 
yasser arafat just as he said the united states tried to kill 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
sharon who unsuccessfully sought his likud blocs nomination for 
prime minister in the past also said he would like to lead israel 
to a peace agreement with its neighbors but rejected ceding any 
captured arab lands 
the retired general in the united states to promote his new book 
the warrior told reporters at a breakfast meeting that there 
are certain people whose activities cannot be tolerated by free 
democratic societies therefore they should be removed 
president reagan tried to kill gadhafi in an air raid in april 
1986 because the libyan strongman had ordered a bomb placed in a 
west german discotheque frequented by us servicemen sharon said 
arafat is in the same category he added 
the united states never publicly identified gadhafi as the target 
of its raid but us officials indicated they hoped to shock some of 
his supporters into breaking with him gadhafi said the aerial 
bombing of tripoli and benghazi killed his infant adopted daughter 
sharon predicted the number of jewish settlers in the occupied 
west bank would reach 100000 next year and said israel should 
grant autonomy to the estimated 15 million palestinians living 
there but retain control of the regions defense 
he rejected the plos demand that israel allow the creation of a 
palestinian state in the west bank reiterating his view that there 
is already a palestinian state in jordan whose population is 
predominantly palestinian 
he praised king hussein for his courage and survival in the face 
of domestic and foreign enemies but urged the jordanian monarch to 
reverse his recent decision to allow groups associated with arafats 
fatah wing of the plo to operate in amman for his own safety he 
should expel them sharon said 
sharon whose recent invitation to visit the soviet republic of 
georgia was withdrawn by soviet authorities said he hoped to be 
able to visit there one day 
his parents were born in russia and he still has an aunt in the 
city of tashkent he said

at least 16 tanker crew members have 
been stopped from boarding their vessels at the oil shipment 
terminal in valdez since june because they had been drinking 
authorities said wednesday 
the alcohol screening program was set up in response to the 
grounding of the tanker exxon valdez which hit a reef hours after 
it left the terminal said george jurkowich a spokesman for alyeska 
pipeline service co 
the exxon valdez dumped almost 11 million gallons of thick north 
slope crude oil in prince william sound on march 24 in the nations 
worst oil spill 
the captain joseph hazelwood was tested hours after the 
accident and alcohol was found in his system 
crew members who go ashore while their tankers are in port pass 
through security at the alyeska terminal before reboarding they are 
given breath tests if it appears to security guards they have been 
drinking jurkowich said 
all ships masters are tested before their vessels leave the 
terminal complex jurkowich said 
between the time the screening system was set up june 1 and 
friday 1087 crew members have passed through the terminal 56 have 
been tested and 16 have been foud to have unacceptable levels of 
alcohol jurkowich said they were prevented from boarding their 
ships 
we think it is a success because we are detecting a small 
percentage of people who are under the influence he said if a 
crewman leaves his vessel leaves the terminal when they come 
back to the terminal they are required to pass through alyeskas 
security office 
jurkowich said the bloodalcohol level of crew members must be 
below 04 percent that is the coast guards highest allowable level 
for operation of a commercial vessel 
the state of alaska and many other states consider motorists 
drunk if they have a bloodalcohol level of 10 
if a crew member fails he must wait an hour and be retested 
its up to the ships owner or agent to determine what happens to 
a crew member who isnt allowed aboard the tanker 
in a related matter a check of maritime pilots in portland 
ore found six of 57 had their drivers licenses suspended at some 
time for drunken driving a television station reported 
katutv reported tuesday the suspensions are listed in oregon 
department of motor vehicles records on the pilots who board ships 
to guide them through the treacherous entrance to the columbia river 
geoff stone president fo the columbia bar pilots association 
responded that there has never been evidence that drinking posed a 
safety problem with the pilots driving records dont necessarily 
have a bearing on a pilots behavior on the job he told the station 
the maritime pilots are licensed and must pass a drug screening 
test he said 
there are 64 pilots for the port seven are residents of 
washington state where driving records are kept private

site 2 thailand ap western relief workers fled a refugee 
camp on the thaicambodian border wednesday as fighting intensified 
between cambodian factions less than two weeks before vietnams 
pledged troop pullout from cambodia 
officials from cambodias khmer peoples national liberation 
front blamed the latest clashes on the failure of last months 
cambodian peace talks in paris 
thai military sources and relief workers said more than 20 
mortars fired by troops of cambodias vietnameseinstalled 
government hit guerrilla positions near the thai village of ban 
sangae a mile from site 2 refugee camp no casualties were reported 
a western relief official also reported heavy fighting near nong 
chan 13 miles north of the thai border town of aranyaprathet 
united nations and international relief workers were forced to 
evacuate site 2 because of nearby fighting a senior un official 
said 
more than 100 workers from international relief agencies work at 
the camp of 140000 cambodians it is the largest on the frontier 
and is administered by the khmer front and supplied by the united 
nations 
another western official said access to the camp thursday would 
be restricted to essential medical staff 
on tuesday he said one mortar landed inside the camp but did 
not explode 
abdul gaffar a senior khmer front official said the fighting 
has intensified because talks aimed at ending cambodias 20yearold 
conflict failed 
his organization is one of three guerrilla factions opposing the 
phnom penh government a khmer front official at site 2 said the 
front received 27 truckloads of chinese weapons and ammunition in 
the past week 
the paris talks ended without a political settlement largely 
because of phnom penhs refusal to include the radical communist 
khmer rouge in a future coalition government 
the khmer rouge the most powerful opposition faction killed 
hundreds of thousands of civilians in an attempt to build an 
agrarian society between 1975 and 1978 
vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 ousted the khmer rouge and 
installed a government it has pledged to withdraw its troops from 
cambodia by the end of september 
gen manat thinkulabute the thai military officer responsible 
for trat and chantaburi provinces where several khmer rouge 
strongholds are located said he expects fiercer fighting along the 
border in the next two to three months 
the guerrillas responded coolly this week to efforts by 
thailands prime minister chatichai choonhavan to negotiate a 
ceasefire according to the nation newspaper of bangkok 
chatichai met guerrilla leaders monday and tuesday and is to meet 
cambodias premier hun sen in bangkok at an unspecified date 
the nation quoted kraisak choonhavan chatichais son and one of 
his advisers as saying the prime minister would continue efforts to 
break the deadlock

members of a house panel said wednesday theyll 
try to amend every major provision of president bushs clean air 
bill but all agreed its time to break a 10year stalemate and pass 
the pollutioncutting measure 
the house energy and commerce environment subcommittee was the 
first panel to consider the bush legislation although the initial 
session was reserved for opening remarks amendments that would 
begin to shape a political compromise will be offered beginning 
tuesday chairman henry a waxman dcalif said 
this bill is a delicate mosaic said chief republican sponsor 
norman f lent of new york who said he feared that the energy and 
commerce committee might fashion a compromise that could unravel on 
the house floor 
the presidents bill seeks to significantly reduce the three 
major air pollution causes ozone which causes urban smog acid 
rain and airborne toxic chemicals 
the opening statements made clear that major battles will be 
fought beginning with the expected threeweek subcommittee 
consideration over reducing auto emissions which also produce 
smog another fight do electric customers of dirtyburning power 
plants get the entire bill for achieving acid rain reductions 
other amendments will seek to ban tall industrial smokestacks 
that merely carry pollution elsewhere to increase protection for 
national parks to establish strict standards to protect health near 
toxic chemical plants and to ensure that no one fuel is favored in 
a program for alternative motor fuels 
lent was upbeat about chances for passage of the bill this 
congress commenting republicans will be far more willing to 
support a bush bill than they would have been to support a bill by 
the democrats 
gop lawmakers had no such alternative the last eight years 
because former president reagan did not propose a clean air bill 
during his eight years in office the last major clean air revisions 
were approved in 1977 
waxman repeated his determination to toughen bushs language on 
auto emissions he aims to tighten tailpipe emission requirements 
to strip a provision to average pollution emissions by engine 
category and to require that onboard antipollution equipment be 
guaranteed for 100000 miles twice as long as in current law 
rep john d dingell dmich the chairman of the full energy 
and commerce committee is expected to oppose waxmans changes and 
argue the auto industrys position the automakers contend that 
introduction of new cars each year with their sophisticated 
antipollution devices would bring a drastic cut auto pollution as 
older models are replaced 
dingell and waxman have fought each other to a stalemate in the 
past on this issue 
lawmakers from pennsylvania west virginia georgia ohio 
illinois indiana kentucky tennessee and missouri are demanding 
that other regions help them pay for acid rain reductions these 
states argue that otherwise their electric utility customers would 
finance a disproportionate share of measures to cut emissions of 
sulfur dioxide the major component of acid rain 
bush seeks to cut sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons by the year 
2000 based on 1980 levels his bill places the entire burden on 
utilities with power plants that burn dirty highsulfur coal 
which are prevalent in the nine states

the old candidate didnt bellow howm i 
doin he didnt mug for the cameras he didnt joke he didnt 
kvetch 
graciously patiently quietly edward i koch stood wednesday 
morning at the lucky subway station entrance where he has shaken 
hands and thanked voters after elections for two decades 
but thanks must come hard when youve been mayor of new york city 
for 12 years and suddenly you hear a young woman say you were a 
great mayor 
koch lost the democratic primary election tuesday night to 
manhattan borough president david dinkins by a 51 percent42 percent 
margin dinkins will face the republican nominee former us 
attorney rudolph giuliani in the nov 7 general election 
for 20 minutes koch repeated thank you thanks very much 
i just came by to say thank you the sidewalk political litany 
he has mastered in the course of 24 campaigns 
he got the same in return good luck good try and from 
one student of current events congratulations 
i hope you get a better job a young man told koch 
there is no better job the mayor replied and later in the 
morning he told a crowd at a democratic unity rally that he would 
never again run for office 
at one point during his administration koch was telling people he 
planned to be mayor forever and no one was really certain if he was 
joking just six months ago speaking in the same ballroom where he 
conceded defeat in the democratic primary on tuesday night he 
admitted that being mayor was not just a job its my life 
that apparently was one reason the 64yearold koch tried to 
become the citys first fourterm mayor despite corruption 
scandals a minor stroke two years ago and poor relations with the 
citys black community 
after his defeat he assured supporters there was indeed life 
after the mayoralty but many wondered what kind the office had 
transformed ed koch from a relatively obscure us representative to 
one of the worlds most famous politicians and given him an almost 
matchless pulpit 
in the end koch seems to have failed to persuade voters black 
and white alike that he could be a force for reconciliation among 
the citys various racial ethnic and religious groups 
seven of 10 black voters said they were convinced he favored 
whites over blacks in office according to a new york timeswcbstv 
exit poll and in the end blacks constituted a tiny 2 percent of 
kochs vote 
more generally the poll found that more than half the voters 
including nine of 10 blacks and four of 10 whites simply 
disapproved of the way the mayor had handled his job 
and there was another factor i think after 12 years people 
were tired of ed koch said jerry skurnik a koch campaign 
official tired it seemed not only of kochs tendency to talk 
before thinking of his periodic arrogance and stridency but also 
of the spread of aids homelessness drug abuse and crime 
a new york daily newswabctv exit poll found that only 24 
percent of democratic voters thought koch was fair to all 
groups only 15 percent said he had good new ideas only 7 
percent agreed he was sensitive to peoples needs 
the candidate was reminded of this ill will as he stood outside 
the subway station at lexington avenue and east 77th street 
the chickens are coming home to roost koch yelled a 
middleaged woman as she passed by the crowd of reporters and 
photographers surrounding koch now stop blocking the subway 
she added 
after koch was finished shaking hands he was asked why he had 
referred to the office he loved as a burden its not easy to be 
mayor he explained its a tough job but you give it your 
best and you come away with a sense of pride and pleasure 
then the man who took the bus to his first mayoral inauguration 
climbed into the back seat of his official cadillac and rode off 
toward city hall it was the 4238th day of his mayoralty with 109 
more to go

antidrug program wednesday from a 13yearold who called the 
punishment murder 
to me killing someone that has committed a very serious crime 
is wrong chantee charles a seventh grader from nearby arlington 
va told a rose garden ceremony it does not solve anything all 
it does is take someone elses life 
taking it all in stride bush complimented chantee and two other 
students invited to speak for doing a good job expressing whats 
on your heart without worrying if people agree with you or not 
bush who has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins and 
for those who kill law enforcement officers was presiding over a 
ceremony honoring the los angelesbased dare drug abuse resistence 
education 
at the ceremony part of bushs continuing efforts to promote his 
new antidrug strategy three washington area students who are 
members of the dare program were invited to read essays 
while the other two stuck to drug themes chantee used most of 
her allotted time to attack the death penalty 
saying probably thousands of innocent prisoners have been 
executed she argued that death penalty proponents miss the point 
that the prisoner has a family too 
the guard that turns on the switch to electrocute the prisoner 
is just as much a murderer as the person who has committed the 
crime she said 
the guy who kills the prisoner must feel guilty afterwards but 
i guess they get paid for it she said if i had one wish id 
wish that the death penalty never existed 
dare has taught me to to make my own decisions and not let 
friends make them for me she added 
chantee a student at arlingtons thomas jefferson intermediate 
school later told reporters she was unaware of bushs strong 
support for the death penalty for certain crimes 
she indicated she had not intended to be provocative but i 
dont like the idea of people getting killed it was just a topic i 
wanted to write about 
maria sheehan a white house aide who helped coordinate the 
program said that the three students were picked to speak by local 
leaders of the dare program we let them say what they wanted 
she said 
the two other students read somewhat less controversial essays 
janine waters 12 also of thomas jefferson intermediate said 
if people offer you drugs just turn away and say no or change 
the subject 
and borris torrico 13 of williamsburg intermediate school also 
in arlington said when youre older and you want to get a new 
car like a porsche you can save up for it and not use it on drugs 
or on alcohol 
my turn bush joked after the three students had made their 
presentations 
he told the student speakers its not eay to get up in front 
of a big scary audience like this and do such a good job say 
whats on your heart not worry if people agree with you or not 
bush praised the dare program as an organization that has 
manned the front lines in the drug war signing a proclamation 
making thursday national dare day bush said these kids have 
dared to excel and they are succeeding he said 
the ceremony came as the white house and congress continued to 
wrangle over how to fund the presidents 79 billion drug program 
although there were hints that a compromise might be near 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater who the day before 
had denounced democrats for playing price tag politics said the 
administration would reluctantly support a proposal by sen 
ernest f hollings dsc 
hollings proposal calls for partially financing drug programs 
with a 0225 percent acrosstheboard cut in other governent 
programs fitzwater said the administration preferred it to a 
proposal by sen robert c byrd dwva calling for 44 billion 
in new drug spending twice the administration plan 
in related developments 
los angeles police chief daryl gates here for the rose garden 
dare ceremony suggested the financing battle between the white 
house and congress was counterproductive and told reporters im 
not going to get in the middle of the oneupsmanship thats going 
on 
former democratic presidential contender jesse jackson met with 
presidential chief of staff john sununu to discuss drug policy 
afterwards jackson told reporters costly military programs like 
the b2 stealth bomber should be trimmed to provide extra funds for 
the battle 
patricia ackerman president of the national alliance of black 
school educators and principal of taylor academy in cleveland 
heights ohio gave bush copies of her students reactions to his 
antidrug tv speech last week 
one student suggested that we needed a crew of robocops to 
crash the drug dealers she said there were others who 
suggested that the minimum wage needed to be increased and then 
selling drugs wouldnt be so attractive to kids

new york city democrats preached unity wednesday the day after 
david dinkins wrested the partys mantle from mayor edward koch and 
thrust himself into a november general election race with republican 
rudolph giuliani 
there was no such consensus in detroit where mayor coleman young 
faces opposition from fellow democrat tom barrow in november but 
young who led a field of 13 candidates in tuesdays nonpartisan 
primary remained an overwhelming favorite to win an unprecedented 
fifth term 
house democrats savored twin victories in texas and california 
where former house speaker jim wright and majority whip tony coelho 
were able to boost democrats into seats the leaders abandoned when 
they became targets of ethics investigations 
in new york koch and two lesserknown democratic candidates 
appeared with dinkins at a city hall rally and pledged to support 
him in november 
dinkins the manhattan borough president beat koch by a 51 
percentto42 percent margin a surprisingly large victory that 
ended kochs dream of winning a record fourth term 
yesterday we were rivals said dinkins who could become new 
yorks first black mayor today were allies united against 
common foes those foes are crime and drugs poverty and pollution 
illiteracy and infant mortality 
he might have added giuliani to the list the former mobbusting 
federal prosecutor trounced cosmetics heir ronald lauder in the gop 
primary and immediately became the most seriously regarded 
republican candidate for mayor since former mayor john lindsay 
giuliani beat lauder by a 67to33 percent margin even though 
lauder spent an estimated 13 million about 350 per vote in a 
mediaintensive sharply negative campaign 
giuliani went on the attack wednesday saying he would be much 
tougher on crime much tougher on corruption much tougher on 
drugs than dinkins 
but dinkins had sent a signal tuesday night that he intends to go 
toetotoe with giuliani on lawandorder issues in his victory 
speech he told cheering supporters i intend to be the toughest 
mayor on crime that this city has ever seen 
in other new york races brooklyn district attorney elizabeth 
holtzman won the democratic primary for city comptroller and special 
state prosecutor charles hynes known for his role in the howard 
beach racial attack case won the democratic primary to succeed her 
in brooklyn as in most new york races victory in those democratic 
primaries is tantamount to election in the heavily democratic city 
in detroit the 71yearold young looked ahead to a general 
election race against a candidate he defeated overwhelmingly in 1985 
barrow a 40yearold accountant who is the nephew of the late 
boxing champion joe louis came in second by a surprisingly 
comfortable margin winning 24 percent of the vote to youngs 51 
percent 
us rep john conyers who staged a lastminute campaign with 
active support from the rev jesse jackson received a disappointing 
18 percent of the vote political experts said that was good news 
for young since conyers was seen as a potentially stronger foe in 
the general election 
conyers shot himself in the foot said wilbur rich an 
associate professor of political science at wayne state university 
and the author of a biography of young his campaign had no 
content no issues 
other congressional democrats had reason to be cheerful after the 
party held back republican assaults on the wright and coelho seats 
fort worth lawyer pete geren won wrights old seat in texas 
defeating republican bob lanier by a 51to49 percent margin 
in californias san joaquin valley assemblyman gary condit won 
coelhos seat over seven other candidates winning 57 percent of the 
vote to 35 percent for his nearest rival republican clare berryhill 
were looking mighty good democratic national chairman ron 
brown said on abcs good morning america 
brown noted that democrats have won four of six special elections 
for congressional seats so far this year thats a good record 
he said we think were off to a good start in 1989 and we intend 
to keep going on that kind of roll

a flash fire in a western kentucky coal 
mine killed 10 miners and injured three today in the nations worst 
mine disaster in five years authorities said 
state police said 13 miners were near the fire at the pyro mining 
cos william station mine 140 miles southwest of louisville and 
three escaped with burns rescue teams were sent into the shaft to 
remove the bodies of the 10 others said trooper ed brady 
the flash fire or ignition occurred about 930 am cdt as a 
mining machine was being dismantled to be moved said frank 
ogorman a spokesman for the federal mine safety and health 
administration 
msha spokesman sam stafford said a flash fire is caused when a 
jet of methane or natural gas ignites like a flamethrower 
methane is found naturally in coal seams but ventilation systems 
normally keep it below explosive concentrations 
the exact cause of the fire was not immediately known but 
stafford said such fires are usually caused when a piece of 
equipment hits stone and causes a spark 
ogorman said the dead were believed to have died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning 
the injured were taken to union county hospital in morganfield 
for treatment of burns brady said their condition was not 
immediately known 
nancy toombs a secretary for state commissioner of mines and 
minerals willard stanley said theres nothing to indicate the 
walls have collapsed or we have anyone trapped underground 
the accident was the nations worst mine disaster since 27 miners 
died in 1984 at the wilberg mine at orangeville utah said ogorman 
the william station mine employs about 350 miners and includes a 
longwall unit a machine that continuously mines coal and allows the 
roof to collapse behind it the state mining agency said

environmentalists tried a new tactic wednesday 
in their dispute over exxons cleanup of oilstained beaches in 
alaska they brought bits of the still polluted beaches to 
washington 
messengers from the national wildlife federation spread out 
across capitol hill to deliver ziplock plastic bags of oilstained 
alaska rocks to every member of congress 
rock samples also went to the white house to other key members 
of the bush administration and to the top executives of exxon corp 
in new york according to spokesmen for the federation as well as 
to reporters at a news conference 
these are the rocks that exxon has cleaned twice jay hair 
the federations president he said he brought them back from smith 
island one of the areas of alaska most affected by the massive 
spill from the exxon valdez oil tanker last march 
the islands beaches already have been cleaned twice by exxon 
but oil continues to seep up from beneath having penetrated as much 
as 40 inches in some areas the environmentalists said 
we wanted every member of congress to actually touch these 
rocks to smell the palpable coatings of crude oil to experience 
for themselves in a small way the immensity of this disaster hair 
said 
criticism of exxons cleanup efforts increased this week as the 
hugh oil company was pulling most of its equipment and manpower out 
of the polluted areas for the winter no further cleanup activity is 
planned until next spring 
exxon which has estimated that the cleanup costs likely will 
exceed 1 billion claims that most of the contaminated beaches have 
been environmentally stabilized and has hinted that it may not 
return for further cleanup activities next next year 
hair ridiculed exxons references to beaches being 
environmentally stabilized 
thats an exxon euphemism it does not mean cleaned up in any 
scientific sense said hair whose federation is the countrys 
largest conservation group with 58 million members no beaches 
have been cleaned exxon can not make this thing go away by their 
arrogance 
earlier this week nearly a dozen of the countrys major 
environmental groups criticized exxons cleanup efforts saying that 
claims by the oil company that 1090 miles of contaminated shoreline 
have been cleaned cannot be substantiated by scientific fact 
the groups said the damage caused to wildlife by the spill has 
yet to be calculated but that so far the confirmed casualties 
include more than 33000 birds 138 bald eagles and 980 sea otters 
alaskas fishing industry also has been thrown into chaos 
hair said that in many cases shorelines have been exposed to 
irretrievable damage but he said exxon should be directed by 
the government to continue cleanup efforts to minimize damage on 
severely oiled areas and limit the contamination to the food chain 
that continues to threaten wildlife 
at this point there is much that cannot be restored he said

existed and created a pipeline of cocaine leading from colombia 
to the united states

lehder to other cartel leaders who also were indicted in the case 
but remain at large in colombia he said that beginning in 1974 
lehder hired pilots and distributors including some of the 
defendants to run the ring in the united states 
the central theme you will hear is a core cast of characters 
including the medellin cartel had a central purpose that never 
deviated to import and distribute cocaine in the united states 
mueller said 
he described the beginnings of the operation and told how it grew 
in 1978 there was a veritable cocaine pipeline from colombia 
to normans cay in the bahamas to the united states mueller said 
attorney clyde collins representing jack reed 58 called the 
governments case a fabrication and said reed was not a key figure 
lehders lieutenant this old man no collins said

him will come from george jung a felon and admitted liar he said 
kane was innocent 
attorney ray david representing lady said his client helped 
secure some ranches in mexico for associates but not for 
drugsmuggling purposes he cautioned jurors not to assume the 
clients are guilty by association 
carlos lehder is not on trial here and drugs are not on 
trial he said 
kevin sanders who represents stewart described him as a 
lawabiding family man who operates a legitimate aircraft business 
sam got here today as the result of a very large and extensive 
witchhunt conducted by the us attorneys office sanders said 
the medellin cartel named for the colombian city where it is 
based is believed to supply 80 percent of the cocaine in the united 
states 
reed is charged with conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or 
more of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise 
kane lady and stewart face the conspiracy count and an additional 
charge of conspiracy to import cocaine herington is charged with 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine

spills of toxic materials on railroads rose by 
13 percent in 1988 but highway incidents dropped a private group 
reported wednesday 
citizen action citing statistics from the transportation 
department said there were 1015 toxic spills on railroads last 
year the most since the department started keeping track of such 
incidents in 1982 
an industry representative however disputed the significance of 
many of the spills cited by citizen action and accused the group of 
trying to cloud railroad safety 
there were no deaths linked to the spills but they caused nine 
major injuries and 27 minor ones and resulted in 24 million in 
damage citizen action said 
texas led the nation with 151 incidents followed by ohio 64 
illinois 59 and georgia 55 the group said 
this growing list of railroad catastrophes and 
nearcatastrophes is no aberation citizen action said rather 
it is the inevitable consequence of the increased reliance on the 
rail transport of toxic chemicals explosives combustibles 
caustics and other hazardous materials 
the totals included small spills that may have been related to a 
broken valve on a rail car or other faulty equipment said robert 
creamer a citizen action spokesman 
there were 4831 highway incidents in 1988 a drop from 4932 
recorded in 1987 citizen action said 
the transportation department data are based only on incidents 
reported to the government and as a consequence are very 
conservative the group said 
but jim reiter a spokesman for the association of american 
railroads said many of the spills counted by citizen action were 
small and occurred in rail yards he said there were 44 major train 
accidents that caused spills down from 50 in 1987 
railroad companies moved 14 million carloads of hazardous 
materials last year he said

commonly used high school texbooks too often 
give students a picture of american history that is without color 
passion point or interest a study released by the american 
federation of teachers said wednesday 
the 158page critique by historian paul gagnon analyzed five 
books and said they neglect the role of religion in american 
history give short shrift to old world roots and fail to explore 
deeply the thinking of such major figures as abraham lincoln 
history is above all a good story and the truth is always the 
best story to tell ourselves gagnon wrote in the study entitled 
democracys halftold story what american history textbooks 
should add 
the writers he said labor too hard to balance affirmation and 
negation and the result is a detached neutrality passionless about 
both the ugly and the beautiful moments in our history 
whatever the case the picture drawn for students is often 
colorless without point or interest gagnon said 
gagnon a professor of history at the university of 
massachusetts wrote the book for the education for democracy 
project a joint venture of the federation an aflcio union 
representing 710000 teachers the educational excellence network 
and freedom house 
albert shanker president of the teachers union joined gagnon 
at a press conference with three of the books stacked on the table 
and said these textooks have some pluses but they also have some 
very great failings they are big fat books lots of names lots of 
facts but a lack of focus 
gagnon said that probably more than twothirds of high school 
juniors are taught from one of the books which were the five most 
widely adopted american history texts for high school use in 1987 
they are not awful and they are not wrong they just dont 
provide enough help to the teacher he said 
nancy nemchik an 8th grade history teacher at kenmore middle 
school in prince georges county md said she agreed with the 
studys conclusions about history texts although she does not teach 
from one of the ones studied 
students find that history is boring ms nemchik said it 
ranks below math and spelling 
gagnon wrote that the longest sketch of lincoln in any of the 
books is a sixparagraph account in a history of the united 
states by daniel j boorstin and brooks m kelley and even it 
does not reach to lincolns beliefs or depth of character 
he said washington adams jefferson madison hamilton and 
franklin all fail to earn adequate descriptions of their ideas 
intellect character or work in any of the five books 
gagnon gave the highest marks to history of a free people by 
henry w bragdon and samuel p mccutchen published by macmillan in 
1981 saying it is superior to the others in writing style analysis 
and thoughtful remarks on economic intellectual and world 
perspectives 
he said the boorstin and kelley book published by ginn and 
company in 1986 follows closely behind in style and 
organization with a narrative that is unusually vigorous and 
less cluttered than the other three 
the remaining texts said gagnon manage to pale down and 
flatten out even the tragedy of the civil war 
the others are 
the united states a history of the republic by james west 
davidson and mark h lytle prenticehall 1988 
people and our country by normak k risjord and terry l 
haywoode holt rinehart and winston 1982 
triumph of the american nation by lewis paul todd and merle 
curti harcourt brace jovanovich 1986 
gagnon said all of the books omit or dumb down the old world 
background of the american experience as though it were of 
little importance 
and because they fail to explore adequately the religious ideas 
of the puritans he said students are left with the impression 
that toleration is the only religious idea worth remembering 
modern readers always ready to mistake their own indifference 
to religion for the virtue of toleration could profit from a wider 
perspective he said 
gagnon criticized all of the books for failing to delve deeply 
into the thinking of principal figures in american history 
even the longer biographical sketches of the founding fathers 
do not reveal their education reading religious or philosophical 
stances cosmopolitanism regard for the ancient respect for 
posterity or place in the enlightenment he said 
the books do give biographical sketches of theodore roosevelt and 
woodrow wilson he wrote but little is said about the 
religious and political principles they held or about the substance 
of their reading and education

publisher ilya levkov looked proudly at books by 
two soviet defectors in his display at moscows international book 
fair 
i have two authors with death sentences against them he 
said and here they are alive and well in my corner 
judging by the fair that opened to the public wednesday the 
soviet union is not only ready to hear the worst about itself but 
to buy it 
six years ago authorities branded at least 50 western books 
intended for the fair as antisoviet and confiscated them 
this year president mikhail s gorbachevs perestroika 
shares shelf space with works by defectors arkady shevchenko and 
stanislav levchenko emigre jewish dissident natan sharansky and 
american hardliner zbigniew brzezinski 
brzezinskis book the great failure is subtitled birth 
and death of communism in the twentieth century 
also on display is john lecarres russia house in which a 
soviet scientists crucial notebooks are passed to a publisher 
attending the believe or not moscow book fair 
levkov who settled in new york after emigrating from the soviet 
union 33 years ago said the soviet publishing company progress 
wants to acquire the rights to brzezinskis book and other soviet 
publishers are interested in almost all his offerings 
at neighboring stands christian and jewish publishers who once 
had to endure harassment from this atheist state said they have 
never had it so easy 
yosef friedman a member of the lubavitch strain of hasidic 
judaism said most of his russianlanguage religious books were 
confiscated in the past but this year he said soviet airport 
customs officers did not even examine his two cartloads of books 
thats better than new york he said it was really 
strange 
soviets crammed the giant pavilions at an exhibition complex in 
north moscow where more than 2000 publishing companies displayed 
their wares and people lined up for hours to get in 
moscow clerk alexei romantsev said that after the literary 
journal novy mir began publishing alexander solzhenitsyns gulag 
archipelago this summer there cant be any risk here or any 
real surprises 
still romantsev said he raced to levkovs booth as soon as the 
fair opened and had been sitting there devouring the emigre press 
for more than two hours 
david kotick of the bantam doubleday dell publishing group inc 
whose booth boasted such western bestsellers as russia house 
and frederick forsyths the fourth protocol said he was swamped 
with offers from soviet publishers 
ive been offered so many things he said but its hard to 
make deals because how are you going to get paid 
the soviet ruble is not freely convertible into other world 
currencies which makes it difficult for soviet companies to import 
goods 
still kotick said soviet publishers are clearly getting good at 
western wheeling and dealing 
this was the first of the biennnial fairs since new rules came 
into effect allowing individual soviet publishers to form direct 
ties with foreign partners and the fairs commercial atmosphere 
brought praise from the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
the event has become a real fair instead of an exhibit of 
forbidden fruit it said and soviet publishers have already 
received orders for about 25 million books 
the official news agency tass said not a single book intended for 
the fair had been confiscated but levkov said one book he had 
planned to bring an obscene epic poem written in the 18th century 
was vetoed by fair organizers beforehand 
for all its changes one tradition of the fair held true 
larceny vendors reported their books were disappearing at record 
rates 
but kotick said he couldnt blame soviet readers hungry for 
literature 
its like a starving man with bread he said

by passenger epaminondas chaves who said garcez told him he had set 
an incorrect course 
when he perceived the error in his computerized plan he could 
have used his air charts which should always be consulted but they 
were folded when the plane crashed the investigating pilot told o 
globo 
other pilots flying in the area when the boeing got lost said 
garcez tuned his radio to a soccer game after he took off garcez

receive us funds to fight cocaine trafficking will meet later this 
month to discuss president bushs antidrug plan a government 
spokesman said wednesday 
foreign minister guillermo larco said president alan garcia had 
confirmed the meeting with colombian president virgilio barco and 
bolivias president jaime paz zamora 
larco said the three will discuss the bush plan which includes 
261 million in aid to fight cocaine trafficking in the three 
countries over the next five years 
peru and bolivia are the worlds primary sources for coca leaf 
the raw material from which cocaine is made colombian drug cartels 
control the production and distribution of the drug 
larco said no date had been set for the meeting but a spokesman 
at the government palace said wednesday the meeting would probably 
be held in lima at the end of september 
garcia meanwhile criticized bush for offering too little 
financial assistance and for turning what he said was an economic 
problem into a military one 
its not a problem of donating some number of helicopters 
sometimes very old helicopters or donating some number of rifles or 
bullets its rather an economic and financial problem garcia 
said 
it would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed 
market for the products that could substitute for the coca he 
said 
garcias comments were made at a meeting in lima of agriculture 
ministers of the andean pact nations which include venezuela 
colombia ecuador peru and bolivia 
in the meeting which ended wednesday the agriculture ministers 
agreed to study whether such crops as coffee cacao and palm oil 
could be economically viable substitutes for coca cultivation

dozens of east germans have taken refuge in 
the west german embassy in warsaw state television reported 
wednesday 
the news program telexpress said there are about 50 east germans 
in the embassy according to unofficial figures 
it broadcast pictures of the refugees in the embassy courtyard 
including children at play 
not long ago this building was under a siege of poles seeking 
visas after budapest and prague east german escapees are seeking 
shelter in the west german embassy in warsaw the news program 
said 
it was referring to east germans who this summer occupied west 
german missions in hungary and czechoslovakia in hopes of being able 
to emigrate to the west 
risking censure from its warsaw pact allies and courting praise 
from the west hungary has opened its borders and allowed more than 
10000 east germans to cross into austria most have headed for west 
germany 
but in czechoslovakia about 250 of 400 refugees holed up in the 
embassy compound gave up tuesday and left after being promised they 
would not be punished and would be allowed to apply to emigrate 
legally 
polish media have reported on the exodus but there has been no 
comment from polands government the first east bloc administration 
led by noncommunists hungary also is pressing for major reforms 
but east german remains one of the most rigidly controlled states 
and refuses to consider demands for change sweeping the communist

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki on 
wednesday convened the east blocs first cabinet led by 
noncommunists and the communist president urged support for it 
from all sides 
mazowiecki whose solidaritydominated cabinet was approved by 
parliament tuesday received a letter expressing support and loyalty 
from 54 members of the security forces in southern poland 
other offers of support came from the communistdominated trade 
union opzz and communist party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski who 
said the communists would offer constructive criticism 
the cabinet known as the council of state met for three hours 
to discuss coordinating the various economic ministries the 
government press office said it named labor minister jacek kuron a 
veteran solidarity activist to handle contacts with trade unions 
the communique said 
the cabinet also met with communist president wojciech 
jaruzelski who urged all poles to support it 
the fact that we are sitting here together may be seen by 
someone as a joke of history and by someone else as the logic of 
history said jaruzelski in comments carried by television most 
important today is that this experiment is successful there are big 
hopes that it will 
jaruzelski imposed martial law in 1981 in an effort to quash 
solidarity however earlier this year he urged the legalization of 
the independent labor movement and its participation in government 
to gain backing for tough economic policies 
rakowski a former prime minister later said in a tv address 
that the party is obliged to support this government but we 
party will not resign from constructive criticism 
he called for a renewal of the party saying communists must 
forget their former monopoly on power and say goodbye to 
remnants of outdated doctrines 
for the first time in any soviet bloc country the communists are 
losing control of the vast ministerial bureaucracies and power for 
political appointments 
solidarity has vowed personnel decisions based on competence and 
commitment to reform and no witch hunt 
a parliamentary commission overseeing the activities of the 
interior ministry met wednesday and agreed to review 93 cases of 
alleged crimes during communist control 
the communists only control four of the 24 seats on the council 
of ministers but retain power over the police and military 
solidarity has 12 votes including mazowieckis the independent 
foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski likely is sympathetic to 
their point of view 
four other posts went to the united peasant party and three to 
the democrats smaller parties that ended their communist alliance 
to form a parliamentary majority with solidarity last month 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz said it would take time 
before the cabinet could begin the radical changes it pledged in an 
effort to pull poland out of economic decline 
balcerowicz said polands tripledigit inflation must be curbed 
but in such a way that we dont stop our governments activities 
in the first or second week 
i dont think it is possible to try to make a radical 
antiinflation operation overnight the risk of social consequences 
due to the economic effects would be excessive

the two governors leading preparations for the 
education summit insisted wednesday that school reform is everyones 
business and politics should not enter discussions with president 
bush later this month 
i really do believe this is a national security issue and 
therefore i believe we should have a bipartisan national plan to 
rescue the countrys educational system and preserve opportunities 
for american kids for the 21st century i believe that said 
arkansas gov bill clinton 
south carolina gov carroll campbell agreed it is a national 
summit not a federal summit this is a summit to focus on the 
role of the federal government 
campbell a republican and clinton a democrat who already has 
begun to implement cuttingedge programs to improve education in his 
state held a daylong hearing to gather ideas and information from 
educators business leaders government officials and others on 
possible topics for the summit set for sept 2728 in 
charlottesville va 
panelists generally agreed with the governors that the various 
groups involved with education should devise national standards and 
goals to be presented to bush for his endorsement and support 
however clinton and campbell conceded to reporters that the 
president has not agreed with the approach 
were still in negotiations and discussions with the white 
house said clinton warning against negative speculations on the 
outcome of the summit we are going to do this this hasnt been 
done before we are doing our best in good faith to say what 
issues ought to be raised and to let other people come in here 
and say that 
asked if there is fear that the president may use the summit as 
a substitute for serious action rather than a first step for 
serious action clinton responded i think it would be wrong to 
have any presumptions about it one way or the other on this i think 
the fact that hes been willing to call us together will go down to 
his credit 
however clinton added i think that if he does try to play 
politics and im not suggesting that he is i think that its a 
trap i think once you pick up this ball you pretty well got to run 
with it if you try to put it down after the summits over then i 
think you have dashed expectations disappointed people a divided 
country people disoriented 
i think he has made a decision that he will have to live with 
and that decision is to assume some personal responsibility for the 
future of the quality of education we have to assume his good 
faith concluded clinton 
the areas in which national goals could be set the governors 
said include reducing school dropout rates making sure every child 
is prepared to attend school decreasing illiteracy among 
workingage americans raising standards in science and math and 
increasing high school graduation rates 
i dont think that we have any magical cure but i do think that 
when we finish this process of pouring all the thought and ideas 
into the funnel that at the other end we will be able to come out 
with a little clearer focus of where we want to go as a nation and 
in the states said campbell

mayor coleman young is heavily favored to win an 
unprecedented fifth term after a primary in which he vanquished his 
most dangerous opponent political experts said wednesday 
young easily led a field of 13 candidates in tuesdays 
nonpartisan election and will face secondplace finisher tom barrow 
in a november runoff 
barrow who was badly defeated by young in the 1985 mayors race 
outpolled us rep john conyers who was seen was a potentially 
stronger candidate and had the support of the rev jesse jackson 
those familiar with the citys politics said conyers a 13term 
congressman with a national reputation ruined his chances by 
entering the race late and running a disorganized ineffective 
campaign 
conyers shot himself in the foot by making derogatory remarks 
about city leaders his campaign had no content no issues said 
wilbur rich an associate professor of political science at wayne 
state university and the author of a biography on young 
at a news conference conyers defended his strategy saying 
campaigns by their nature are disorganized however asked what 
he would have done differently he said i would have started 
earlier 
barrow 40 began campaigning for this years race soon after 
losing to young in 1985 conyers entered a day before the filing 
deadline in may 
most observers believe that the 71yearold young is a shooin to 
win on nov 7 unless barrow comes up with a secret strategy or the 
mayor makes a major blunder 
the rev jim holley a wellknown detroit activist who remained 
neutral in the primary said barrow has limited appeal among average 
residents of the nations sixth largest city with most of his 
support coming from white voters and buppies black urban 
professionals 
hes going to have to spend eight weeks demonstrating to the 
grassroots people he is concerned holley said 
rich said barrow still needs to find out how government 
works he referred to a campaign blunder in which barrow promised 
to appoint a deputy mayor for education apparently unaware that the 
mayor doesnt have authority over the board of education 
barrow nephew of the late prize fighter joe louis hasnt paid 
his dues said tom turner secretarytreasurer of aflcio in detroit 
and a democratic party leader 
young has the kind of charisma and personality that he is able 
to get a lot of industry and business people to do things in the 
city of detroit turner said im not sure tom barrow is 
sophisticated enough to do those kind of things 
conyers may suffer next year if he seeks a 14th term in congress 
turner added 
once you attempt to take on someone like coleman young you are 
very vulnerable and next year a lot of people will be going after 
his seat he said conyers never really was organized enough to 
take a comprehensive program to the citizens of detroit

educators urged president bush on wednesday to 
use his upcoming education summit with governors as a springboard to 
achieve a new national consensus on what children should learn 
bush joined education secretary lauro f cavazos in the 45minute 
brainstorming session at the white house with leaders of 17 national 
education organizations 
bush who has said he wants to be the education president 
has already decided not to invite them or any other education 
experts to participate in his sept 2728 meeting with the governors 
in charlottesville va 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush wants the 
governors to help develop a set of realistic goals for the nation 
in education 
the president believes that the nations education system needs 
more accountability in terms of student achievement he will suggest 
the need for a resultsoriented education system and ask the 
governors for their ideas to make education meet those goals in a 
more effective manner said fitzwater 
but bush likely will propose the goals not at the end of the 
meeting but at a later date fitzwater said 
if the educators were miffed at their exclusion from the summit 
they werent showing it as they emerged from the roosevelt room of 
the white house 
keith geiger the new president of the national education 
association said the major overall theme was that the president 
could lead in a national role of setting educational goals for 
this country 
that could include spelling out what youngsters need to know in 
order to graduate from high school said geiger 
albert shanker his counterpart at the american federation of 
teachers cautioned there will be a tremendous letdown if the 
summmit takes place and turns out to be a mere media event and 
doesnt come up with anything thats substantive 
shanker said washington doesnt need to establish a national 
curriculum but must be concerned about the percentage of high 
school graduates capable of reading and writing at advanced levels 
cavazos noted that many governors were holding their own 
presummit meetings to canvass experts for advice and he emphasized 
that the charlottesville meeting was only a start 
its the beginning of an opening dialogue not only with 
the governors but with all of the people with the teachers with 
the educators with the students parents said cavazos 
cavazos said the bush administration aims to move education 
back to the forefront of national attention 
the former university president said he expects the summit to 
produce a commitment at the national level to truly restructure 
the educational system in america 
cavazos who has complained that school reform has produced only 
meager improvements said everyone in that room knows what it 
takes the fundamental question is why hasnt it happened 
i think it is a question of leadership to be provided by the 
president and the governors in turn at their states and the 
national momentum the education secretary said 
geigers invitation to participate in the parley with the 
president was the first for an nea chief executive since the carter 
years 
last month bush remarked that the nea has been frustrated with 
me for evermore 
theyve opposed me every time ive ever run for office that i 
can remember and so whats new i mean theyve got their approach 
to education and ive got mine and i am right and they are 
wrong the president said aug 23 
geiger said he personally thanked bush for the invitation 
we will disagree we will always disagree but i think we will 
be able to work with the administration the union head said 
meanwhile two of the governors leading the preparations for the 
summit said educational excellence is too crucial to the nations 
future to let politics enter into the discussions with bush 
arkansas gov bill clinton told reporters i really do believe 
this is a national security issue we should have a bipartisan 
national plan to rescue the countrys educational system 
clinton and gov carroll campbell of south carolina said the 
summit sessions could set goals in areas such as reducing dropout 
rates cutting adult illiteracy and raising high school graduation 
rates

the house passed legislation wednesday to 
outlaw the trading practices cited in a wave of indictments 
involving the nations two largest futures exchanges in chicago 
the commodity futures improvements act which passed 420to0 
also would give extra muscle to the commodity futures trading 
commission which congressional critics have called too gentle a 
watchdog of the nations futures markets 
the legislation makes sweeping changes in trading practices 
exposed in last months indictments of 45 brokers and traders and a 
clerk at the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of 
trade 
the bill would 
ban insider trading on the nations 13 active futures exchanges 
require floor traders those who trade only for themselves and 
not for outside customers to register with the cftc 
limit trading among broker associations that could conflict with 
customers accounts 
severely restrict the practice of dual trading 
in dual trading floor traders on an exchange can trade for 
themselves as well as their customers on the same day 
while not illegal the practice has raised conflictofinterest 
questions about whether traders take care of themselves ahead of 
their customers supporters of the practice say it is necessary to 
maintain market liquidity when there are few customer orders 
the bill also requires exchanges to maintain accurate trading 
records so that investigators can reconstruct any given transaction 
the chicago indictments included numerous charges of customers 
defrauded through falsified trading records transactions on the 
chicago exchanges as well as others around the country use 
handwritten paper cards to record sales and purchases with the 
trader entering the information 
within weeks of the indictments the two chicago exchanges 
announced they were working to develop handheld computer terminals 
to record floor trading 
the bill would require exchanges one year after enactment to 
develop systems that would pinpoint the time of a trades execution 
to within one minute of its occurrence 
that standard would be tightened to 30 seconds within three years 
of enactment 
the bill also would make permanent the cftc which which congress 
has reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four years 
since it was created in 1974 
the senate has yet to take up the cftcs reauthorization but sen 
patrick leahy dvt and chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said last week that he was asking staff members to draw 
up legislation to correct gaps in the agencys surveillance of 
trading activities

the mayor of north chicago was the first in line 
when a drug testing program for all 160 city workers got under way 
a program authorities called the first of its kind in the nation 
critics suspect it is unconstitutional 
the program is aimed at creating a drugfree workforce and 
setting an example for the community said mayor bobby thompson 
president bush just mentioned that government has to get 
involved in the drug war in his speech the other day so we were 
one step ahead of him thompson said in a telephone interview 
from office clerks to aldermen 63 employees in north chicago a 
middleclass community of 18500 about 25 miles north of chicago 
were tested last friday and the remainder were to be tested 
thursday thompson said 
those who test positive for drug or alcohol use will be offered 
help but not fired any employee who tests positive a second time 
will be subject to dismissal the mayor said 
employees must sign a consent form before they are tested and 
all have agreed to do so he said 
if they choose not to be tested theres nothing you can do 
but thats grounds for suspicion thompson said the person is 
definitely watched because what do you have to hide 
north chicago police chief ernest fisher said he thinks the city 
is the first in the nation with such a testing program 
larry cirignano spokesman for us drug czar william bennett 
agreed saying i dont think anybody has it for all city 
employees 
the program is allowed under a new ordinance that calls for 
mandatory drug testing only where theres reasonable suspicion 
that an employee is using drugs said bob long an attorney for 
north chicago 
i think most city employees have followed the lead of the mayor 
and all the top administration in city government he said im 
not aware of anyone whos declined 
but a few workers have questioned the constitutionality of the 
new law and contacted the american civil liberties union which is 
investigating said aclu attorney alan chen 
the problem is not how the law is written but rather the way 
city administrators have described the tests publicly and to 
employees chen said 
the way its been characterized by the city is that they are 
mandatory he said 
if it were mandatory policy our position would be that it 
was blatantly unconstitutional he said 
obviously there are many reasons somebody would and could 
refuse to submit voluntarily to this kind of test including 
privacy concerns he said 
if the aclu determines that employees are being coerced into 
taking the tests we would seriously consider taking action 
immediately to halt the program chen said 
the idea for the program arose three years ago when north chicago 
began drug tests for all prospective city employees thompson said 
we ran into so many people who were users at that time we 
decided that maybe wed check into this further 
the ordinance passed by the city council on aug 21 is based on 
a contract that already governed the citys police department and 
allows tests to be administered up to four times a year the mayor 
said no decision has been made on how frequently the tests will be 
given to other city workers

ayatollah ali khamenei said wednesday the 
united states still resents irans 10yearold islamic revolution 
and that any conciliatory gestures by the bush administration toward 
his country cannot be trusted 
the iranian spiritual leaders hourlong speech came during the 
latest wave of antiamericanism which began last week after 186 
us legislators called for an economic boycott of iran to press for 
a new government 
in his speech khamenei described the united states as a 
usurper that treated iran like a puppet iran before the 1979 
revolution 
speaking before a crowd of iranians at his tehran residence 
khamenei said washington has had a deep grudge against iran since 
the islamic revolution toppled a prowestern monarchy in 1979 
even if it comes and says now lets be friends and let us 
come back as friends it is obvious that its intention still is 
enmity exploitation and domination he said in the speech 
his address broadcast live on state tehran radio and monitored 
in nicosia was frequently interrupted by shouts of death to 
america 
there was speculation that after ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
death on june 3 iran would move toward restoring ties with the 
west mainly because it needs the technology and expertise to 
rebuild a shattered economy 
khamenei succeeded khomeini and hashemi rafsanjani leader of 
the socalled pragmatists was elected president july 28 both 
developments increased western hopes of a more open foreign policy 
after a decade of isolation 
but the antiamerican fervor was rekindled last week when the 
us congressmen called on president bush to impose an arms embargo 
and economic boycott to press for change and a new order in iran 
in a statement wednesday the islamic revolutions guards corps 
irans main military force condemned the congressmens appeal 
the letter proves the shamelessness and impudence of the arrogant 
and expansionist regime of the great satan 
their statement was carried by the official islamic republic news 
agency which was also monitored in nicosia

the bush administration told congress on 
wednesday that it wants to admit 50000 soviet refugees but doesnt 
have the money to resettle many of the applicants suggesting that 
some go to israel or return to the soviet union 
there are already 17000 soviets waiting in italy for permission 
to enter the united states and those who are rejected can always 
go to israel or return to russia jewel s lafontant the state 
departments coordinator for refugee affairs told the house 
subcommittee on immigration 
in these days of glasnost thats not an impossible thing 
she said 
rep hamilton fish rny was critical of lafontants solution 
i dont think this is an appropriate response to someone whos 
been languishing outside his country with the expectation of being 
allowed to come here he told reporters you cant turn around 
and send them back 
the majority of soviet refugees are jews who leave the soviet 
union on israeli visas shifting direction for the united states 
once they reach processing centers in vienna or rome 
israel facing an increased arab population both within and 
outside its borders has said it would welcome more soviet jews 
however the arab league reacted angrily wednesday saying 
increased jewish immigration could adversely affect palestinian 
rights and the future of peace and stability in the middle east 
the administration testifying on its worldwide refugee plan for 
fiscal 1990 said it doesnt have sufficient money to fund the 
125000 refugees it wants to admit beginning oct 1 that figure 
represents about an 8 percent increase from fiscal 1989 
soviet refugees are the largest group among the 125000 followed 
by vietnam with 26500 east asians with 25000 and 6500 each from 
eastern europe the near east and south asia 
the figure for eastern europe the same as this years is 
designed mostly for poles and hungarians who already have applied 
as well as for a possible increase in romanian and bulgarian 
applicants administration officials said 
the most controversial element in the administration proposal 
centers on soviet refugees whose numbers have swelled as a result 
of president mikhail gorbachevs liberalized emigration policies 
the increased refugee flow brings problems in its wake 
lafontant said but how much better it is to have to deal with the 
problems caused by the success of ones policies than to deal with 
problems caused by failure 
in an emergency move last spring the administration nearly 
doubled its soviet refugee quota for fiscal 1989 to 44000 
jewish groups estimate at least 72000 jews and more than 
100000 soviets altogether will apply for refugee status in fiscal 
1990 
with no sign of decline in applications from soviet citizens 
seeking admission to the us we judge that 50000 is if anything 
a conservative estimate of the potential admission requirements 
said princeton lyman the state departments director of the office 
of refugee programs 
lyman said the administrations proposed fiscal 1990 budget 
includes funding for only 84000 refugees placing the onus on the 
congressional appropriations committees to come up with about 60 
million to pay for the remainder 
about 10000 of the 125000 slots will be funded by private 
organizations he said 
lyman also said the administration in an effort to save money 
and accommodate increasing numbers of soviet refugees was changing 
its method of processing applicants by beefing up the staff at the 
moscow embassy and enlarging its facilities in the united states to 
enable some processing here 
sources have said the proposal foresees phasing out facilities in 
ladispoli outside rome and in vienna both serve as waiting points 
for soviet emigres seeking refugee status 
the administration estimates that as many as 20000 soviets are 
waiting in italy and austria while another 35000 applicants are 
waiting processing in moscow 
lyman said top priority would be granted to those who have 
already applied for refugee status if a large number of those are 
approved most of the proposed 50000 slots would be taken leaving 
little room for new applicants 
those who are ineligible as refugees who are given full 
government funding may still apply as immigrants or seek special 
parole status 
officials also told the panel they didnt anticipate growth in 
the number of refugees from nicaragua despite a project to 
demobilize the ussupported contra rebels and send them home from 
their bases in honduras and costa rica 
of the 3500 slots allotted to latin america and the caribbean 
about 3000 are expected to be filled by cubans

proposed legislation to allow senior citizens 
to take jobs as child care workers without having their social 
security benefits reduced got a cold reception wednesday from the 
social security administration 
deputy social security commissioner louis enoff told a house 
subcommittee that while the agency agrees that older americans 
should be encouraged to stay in the workforce relaxing the social 
security earnings limit would be too expensive 
we have not been able to come up with a way that would not 
involve significant shortterm costs enoff told a subcommittee of 
the house select committee on aging 
under current law workers aged 65 trrough 69 lose 1 in social 
security benefits for every 2 they earn above 8880 the limit is 
6480 for workers under age 65 and there is no limit for those 70 
or older 
in 1990 benefits for those aged 6569 will be reduced 1 for 
every 3 earned above the limit 
almost 1 million social security beneficiaries lose some or all 
of their benefits each year because of the test in effect for those 
aged 6569 and an additional 100000 people in that age group do 
not file for social security benefits because the test is in effect 
according to social security 
reps tom tauke riowa and william hughes dnj have 
introduced legislation to exempt the earnings of child care workers 
aged 65 or older from the social security earnings limits saying 
the proposal would encourage older americans to work longer and help 
meet the nations day care needs 
the congressional budget office estimated the bill would cost 85 
million over five years 
why shouldnt we attempt to match needs such as child care to 
the desire to get older americans who have so much to offer back 
into the workforce asked hughes acting chairman of the 
subcommittee 
i dont have any disagreement with trying to match them 
enoff responded my only concern would be a massive elimination of 
something like the earnings test or to try to administer a way of 
picking and choosing which earnings would be exempt 
hughes said the earnings exemption could be extended to other 
areas in which there are shortages such as skilled nursing with 
the nation eventually repealing the earnings limit altogether 
we need to be doing a far better job than weve done to date in 
trying to find out how we can get older americans back into the 
mainstream of american life he said 
carolyn golding deputy assistant labor secretary took no 
position on the legislation but told the subcommittee that 
premature retirement becomes a real cost to the individual worker 
the employer and the nation 
there is much to be gained by using older workers to meet the 
needs for day care she said

the new president of beijing university on 
wednesday blamed ousted communist party chief zhao ziyang and his 
predecessor hu yaobang for the spring democracy movement which 
students from his school helped lead 
economist wu shuqing said the school is taking steps to prevent a 
recurrence of the popular protests which the army crushed on june 
34 
there is no place on the university campus for bourgeois 
liberalism because it is a political not an academic question wu 
said in his first interview since being named president last month 
bourgeois liberalism is a catchphrase for western liberal ideas 
he said the school will hire more teachers of ideology and place 
as much emphasis on educating students in marxistleninist theories 
as academics 
wu attributed student activism last spring to the failure of zhao 
and hu to give enough stress to political and ideological work 
hu was purged in 1987 because of prodemocracy student protests 
in the winter of 198687 his death on april 15 precipitated the 
spring democracy movement hundreds of posters went up at beijing 
university mourning hus passing and subtly criticizing the 
government 
the school considered chinas most prestigious has been the 
hardest hit in the crackdown on dissent that began in june 
seniors returned to campus this summer for weeks of intensive 
political study those who did not demonstrate that their thinking 
was ideologically correct were not allowed to graduate 
the freshman class was cut to 600 from a planned 2100 students 
were ordered to undergo a year of military training before beginning 
studies 
wu called the training an experiment 
the beginning of the fall term was delayed until oct 14 
apparently to prevent students from disrupting the oct 1 
celebration of the 40th anniversary of communist rule 
some people on campus have said another reason was that political 
education among beijing university teachers was taking longer than 
planned many of them particularly younger teachers joined the 
protests and showed sympathy for the students even in the crackdown 
however wu said i feel the overwhelming majority of beijing 
universitys teaching staff support the central authorities and 
realize the harm which resulted from the antigovernment riots 
chinas official xinhua news agency said 3000 of the schools 
12000 students already have returned to campus 
wu 57 replaced ding shisun who headed the school for four 
years and through two major student movements the spring protests 
and the prodemocracy marches of the winter of 198687 
unlike other schools ding did nothing to stop beijing university 
students from taking the lead 
wu said ding still teaches mathematics news reports of dings 
dismissal characterized it as nonpolitical saying he cited health 
reasons 
the official beijing daily newspaper said wednesday that the 
united states is being twofaced in criticizing the imposition of 
martial law in beijing since america had thriving relations with 
taiwan when that nationalist chinese island bastion had martial law 
it was precisely during the period of martial law that taiwans 
economy and tourist industry with the great help of the united 
states began to prosper it said 
martial law was declared in beijing on may 20 two weeks before 
soldiers ended the student occupation of tiananmen square 
premier li peng said recently martial law must remain for now 
because bad elements who stole military arms during the turmoil 
are still at large 
the beijing daily said the united states gave extraordinary 
support in military and economic aid to taiwan during the time it 
was under martial law from 1949 to 1987 
in the eyes of some americans whether a country implements 
martial law or not is actually immaterial the daily said those 
who now use martial law to condemn china are shameless but 
after all it is difficult to completely hide the harboring of evil 
intentions

members of an elks lodge voted to admit two 
black men whose rejection earlier this year led the national 
fraternal organization to change its voting rules 
the 1600 members of the lodge a popular eating and 
entertainment center here voted late tuesday to admit ernie 
hutchinson a 57yearold santa barbara county housing official and 
joe martin a 56yearold real estate agent 
five white candidates also gained admission to the allmale 
benevolent and protective order of elks no vote tally was released 
i feel very gratified and personally relieved that its over 
said martin now maybe things can get back to normal and the elks 
can get on with their business of providing scholarships and 
performing community service 
martin and hutchinson will be initiated on oct 17 lodge 
secretary walt cooperider said 
hutchinson the first of the two blacks candidates to apply to 
the lodge founded in 1963 was rejected jan 17 and martin was 
rejected later the two were told that fewer than a dozen members 
voted against them 
the rejections prompted the california chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people to call for a 
boycott of the elks 
community groups in this city of 31000 people about 140 miles 
northwest of los angeles including the lompoc school district 
severed their ties with the organization about two dozen lodge 
members resigned in protest and the state attorney generals office 
said it would investigate the lodge for civil rights violations 
in july delegates to the elks 125th annual national convention 
threw out the old rule which allowed any three members of a lodge 
to reject a candidate and which some said made it difficult for 
blacks to join the elks under the new rule a twothirds majority 
can approve a new member 
for most of its history the 15 millionmember organization has 
been allwhite in 1973 it changed its bylaws to include all men 
and blacks have joined other lodges since then 
the elks donate their time and money to everything from rodeos to 
pancake breakfasts and local chapters run such projects as 
providing college cholarships and funding hotlunch programs for 
senior citizens nationally the club raises millions of dollars for 
charity

a senate subcommittee voted wednesday to place 
strings on the 85 million in us aid for el salvador next year 
signaling that lawmakers will watch the new government for progress 
on human rights and peace with leftist rebels 
we want to let them know we are really serious said sen 
patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate appropriations foreign 
operations subcommittee who added the restrictions to a 144 
billion foreign aid bill 
leahys provision will be put to the test when the full 
appropriations committee grapples with the bill on thursday and he 
conceded a vote on whether to keep the restrictions in place will be 
close the language is vehemently opposed by the bush administration 
the measure would divide the 85 million in aid into three slices 
which would be triggered at fourmonth intervals beginning oct 1 
the first two installments could be paid after the administration 
reports and consults with congress on the situation in el salvador 
but the third increment would in effect be made subject to a veto 
by lawmakers with jurisdiction over foreign aid money if they 
believe salvadoran president alfredo cristiani is not doing enough 
to make peace 
el salvadors rightist government is involved in peace talks with 
the leftist fmln rebels aimed at ending a decade of fighting that 
has cost more than 70000 lives death squads linked to cristianis 
arena party have been blamed for most of the deaths while 
substantially curtailed human rights groups say the killings have 
not been entirely stopped 
the house version of the foreign aid bill approved july 21 
included an 85 million cap on aid to el salvador but placed no 
restrictions on the money that amount is 12 million less than 
president bush asked for 
other highlights of the foreign aid measure included 
a provision sure to provoke controversy from greek americans 
that would let the president cut aid to greece so long as military 
aid money previously sent remains unspent if bush were to exercise 
the authority it would in effect upset the longstanding ratio 
that sends 7 to greece for every 10 sent to turkey a us ally in 
conflict with greece over cyprus 
85 million for a fund to support private enterprise in poland 
far more than bush asked for during his trip to eastern europe in 
july the panel added 75 million to bushs 10 million figure by 
adopting an amendment by sen dennis deconcini dariz 
160 million for the multilateral assistance initiative for the 
philippines together with authority for the president to send an 
additional 40 million to meet his full request for 200 million 
the house voted 160 million for the program

many were culled but many were chosen 
such was the night of news and documentary emmy awards with 50 
given in 27 categories at one point it provoked a gentle joke from 
billionaire malcolm forbes a presenter 
there were three winners out of four nominees in one category he 
mused and i just wonder how the one who didnt win feels 
pbs led the pack with 18 winners followed by cbs with 16 abc 
with eight and nbc with five an hbo special jfk in his own 
words got cables lone emmy for achievement in 1988 
when the nontelevised blacktie ceremonies at the 
waldorfastoria hotel finally ended late tuesday night even a 
syndicated show that bowed last fall to critical boos when it was 
known as usa today the television show had won two emmys for 
title sequences and art direction 
true critically acclaimed works were honored including ted 
koppels nightline town meeting special from israel on abc and 
fine coverage of a breaking stories got emmy honors including cbs 
special on last years bombing of pan am flight 103 and fred 
francis nbc nightly news report on the uss vincennes and its 
downing of an iranian jetliner 
but at times it seemed a hard task not to win 
example in the category of segments stories in 
informational cultural or historical programming there were nine 
nominees six of them from cbs west 57th there were three 
winners all were west 57th entries 
in another segment category for outstanding 
backgroundanalysis of a single current story abcs 2020 
won three emmys for various stories there had been eight network 
nominees 
in yet another segment category for outstanding 
interviewinterviewers there were seven nominees and four 
winners yet another segment category for a continuing news story 
had eight nominees half of them won 
methinks it might be a good idea to restrict each category to no 
more than two winners 
cbs meredith vieira who shared in the first four emmys she ever 
has won proved one of the nights most frank and gracious winners 
when she paid tribute to jane stone producer of one of her west 
57th reports 
stone shared an emmy with the correspondent for the segment 
vieira referring to her colleagues offcamera reportage on the 
story said this was truly her piece not mine i came in at the 
end

base said the vice presidents press secretary david beckwith he

officials but that he was extremely interested in the companys 
views 
exxon has disagreed with state and federal officials throughout 
the course of the cleanup on the adequacy of the companys efforts 
theres still a good deal of uncertainty about the future of 
the cleanup program we hope theres less uncertainty after we 
leave said beckwith 
the alaskan stop as quayle flies to korea japan the philippines 
and malaysia 
president bush had hoped to nonymity had said earlier 
that administration officials convinced bush it would not be 
politically beneficial to refocus attention on the spill after 
initial criticism that he took too long to get the federal 
government involved in the cleanup 
asked about the administration position on the amount of oil 
still not cleaned up fitzwater said i dont think we can 
characterize that situation were running into bad weather up there 
and well have to see how things look in the fall in terms of the 
spill cleanup

for any cleanup costs it incurred

12 billion

more than 61000 boat people fled vietnam in the 
first eight months of this year a figure higher than any full year 
since 1981 and hong kong is bearing the brunt of the influx a un 
group said wednesday 
the situation in hong kong continues to look very worrying 
said raymond hall a spokesman for the office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
the office registered 61345 arrivals in countries of first 
asylum in south east asia and japan from january through august 
just before seasonal conditions traditionally slow down the exodus 
the outflow compared with 45500 for last year and 74000 in 
1981 hong kong reported 32000 arrivals during the first eight 
months almost twice the 1988 total of 18400 the un group said 
in recent weeks there have been numerous fights in the crowded 
hong kong camps and cholera has broken out among other vietnamese 
refugees living in primitive conditions on outlying islands 
most of the newcomers in the british colony face forced 
repatriation as economic migrants because only those boat people 
who arrived before june 16 1988 were automatically considered to 
be fleeing political persecution and thus eligible for refugee 
status 
in june a 60nation conference in geneva formally endorsed a 
plan to curb the outflow but did not commit itself on how to deal 
with economic refugees 
hall said it was still too early to assess the impact of the 
conference saying there were definite signs of abatement in 
some regions 
the measures adopted by the geneva conference call for efforts to 
encourage the voluntary return of migrants who are refused refugee 
status so far only 260 have gone back despite formal assurances by 
communist vietnam that they are welcome and need not fear any 
reprisals 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said wedneday that 
vietnam remains opposed to any forced return of the boat people 
the vietnamese official also said negotiations with washington 
were continuing regarding the 94000 former detainees of vietnamese 
reeducation camps who have been promised new homes in the 
united states along with their families he said this program would 
involve roughly 500000 people 
he spoke to reporters after a twoday meeting in geneva with 
western businessmen

president daniel ortega accused the 
bush administration of blocking contributions from europe and latin 
america to finance next years national elections 
the united states is obstructing the financing pressuring a 
series of countries in latin america and europe so they wont 
finance the electoral process the sandinista party newspaper 
barricada quoted ortega as saying 
the article wednesday did not specify how the united states was 
purportedly blocking such aid 
the elections scheduled for feb 25 will cost an estimated 25 
million and foreign aid is essential to cover at least part of that 
because of nicaraguas severe economic crisis 
under nicaraguan law 50 percent of any us contribution to 
opposition candidates must go to the national election council 
which is to run the elections 
the bush administration wants congress to appropriate 3 million 
for the national endowment for democracy a private nonprofit 
corporation funded largely by the us government for the campaign 
of violeta barrios de chamorro the main opposition candidate 
ortega said if it wants to donate to mrs chamorros campaign it 
should appropriate 6 million and share it with the national 
elections council 
mrs chamorro publisher of the opposition newspaper la prensa 
is running on a ticket with virgilio godoy of the liberal 
independent party for the national opposition union a 14party 
coalition 
the united states problem is whether to maintain or not its 
economic embargo of nicaragua but it cant obstruct the inflow of 
funds to cover the elections he added 
barricada did not say where ortega made the remarks but the 
presidential press office said ortega spoke monday at a gathering of 
farmers from cooperatives 
ortega also said that if us congressmen want to come to 
nicaragua as election observers they must first support a central 
american peace plan to dismantle the ussupported contra rebels by 
dec 8 
ortega and the presidents of honduras el salvador costa rica 
and guatemala agreed aug 7 to a plan to dismantle the contra force 
in exchange ortega has committed his sandinista national 
liberation front a leftist organization in power for the past 10 
years to hold free and fair elections 
rep mickey edwards rokla one of four congressmen who met 
ortega on sunday said if the sandinistas hold fair elections on 
schedule usnicaraguan relations will improve regardless of who 
wins 
otherwise edwards warned nicaragua could expect more aid to the 
contras 
the congressional delegation was joined by janet mullins an 
assistant secretary of state who heads the state departments 
congressional affairs office the state department said wednesday 
it was the first highlevel meeting between the us 
administration and the sandinistas since january 1985 when us 
officials accused nicaragua of negotiating in bad faith high level 
contacts with nicaragua were barred after that

the four most powerful men in israels 
government clashed at a closeddoor meeting wednesday over egypts 
peace plan and a reported proposal to sponsor an opening meeting in 
cairo between israelis and palestinians 
the army meanwhile revealed that soldiers patrolling the occupied 
gaza strip have been authorized to fire with live ammunition on 
unarmed masked youths who refuse to stop for questioning in a new 
effort to crack down on uprising activists 
in gaza masked palestinian assailants beat and stabbed to death 
an arab suspected of cooperating with israeli authorities arab 
reports said the army confirmed the death and said it was 
investigating 
three israeli dailies reported egyptian plans to hold peace talks 
in cairo the reports quoted us and israeli sources as saying 
president hosni mubarak of egypt would soon issue invitations to 
such a session in coordination with the united states 
it would reportedly include a palestinian delegation from the 
occupied territories and an israeli team the haaretz and davar 
newspapers said 
american and soviet delegations will also to be invited the 
englishlanguage jerusalem post reported 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc 
dismissed mubaraks ideas in a speech in tel aviv saying the plan 
is not on our agenda in my opinion it cannot help us 
hours earlier shamir and foreign minister moshe arens argued 
about the proposals at a meeting with vice premier shimon peres and 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of the leftleaning labor party 
israel television reported 
peres said on tv he would support a preliminary meeting between 
israelis and palestinians what we have recommended is that there 
be a meeting between us and the palestinians he said 
peres also indicated support for egypts 10point peace plan that 
backs israels proposal to hold elections in the occupied 
territories but also advocates trading land for peace 
the occupied gaza strip and west bank were captured by israel 
from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
labor has long supported territorial compromise with the arabs as 
a basis for a peace settlement likud is opposed demanding israeli 
control over occupied territories 
accepting the egyptian plan would allow the palestinian 
delegation to enter the eve of negotiations peres said we need 
a palestinian side to begin negotiations 
rabin said on israel radio he would favor meetings with a 
palestinian delegation only if such meetings were based on the 
israeli peace initiative 
if there is a reason for discussions in the government it 
will be on the possibilities of a meeting of delegations between 
israelis and palestinians based on the israeli peace initiative 
rabin said 
the new gunfire orders come after rabin said last week that the 
army needed more effective measures to combat masked palestinian 
militants who roam streets in the disputed lands threatening arabs 
who do not obey uprising leaders 
under previous orders troops could only shoot at masked youths 
carrying weapons such as guns knives or axes 
army officers blamed masked youths for a recent upsurge in 
firebomb and stoning attacks on army patrols and a sharp increase in 
the killing of arabs suspected of cooperating with israeli 
authorities 
at least 114 palestinians have been killed by their brethren as 
suspected collaborators during the 21monthold revolt against 
israeli rule the television said 84 died in the last three months 
the latest was jibara abu taha 35 of khan yunis in the gaza 
strip who was fatally stabbed and beaten wednesday by masked 
youths hospital offiicals and arab reports said 
troops shot and wounded 10 palestinians in clashes throughout the 
seaside gaza strip hospital officials said the army was checking 
the reports 
at least 567 palestinians have died in clashes with troops or 
israeli civilians during the uprising forty israelis also have been 
killed

soviet elections are hampered by vague rules 
and the fear of officials that democracy might be moving too 
fast says the chairman of the federal election commission who on 
wednesday detailed help his group is giving the soviets to develop 
their voting system 
the fact is that it is hard to find the procedures written down 
procedure was kind of being developed as they went along 
federal election commission chairman danny l mcdonald told a news 
conference 
mcdonald who led a commission team to the soviet union june 
414 said that in his discussions with soviet officials time and 
time again i got the distinct impression that even the most 
ardent critics of the general process were concerned that the 
process might be moving too fast 
the fec chairman also said the soviets disliked some aspects of 
us democracy 
they are astounded at the amount of money that we spend and 
astounded by the close scrutiny that politicians have to undergo 
in this country mcdonald said 
commission members releasing a report on their visit also found 
that although soviet leaders wanted to preserve the political 
monopoly of the communist party many soviet politicians and 
citizens favored a westernstyle system with several parties 
members of the soviet central electoral commission are not 
interested in many parties they made that very clear that there 
was the communist party and that there may be divisions within it 
but they are not looking at a whole variety of political parties 
said lee ann elliott vice chairman of the us commission 
many of the candidates elected to the soviet parliament last 
spring do favor a multiparty system she said but the people who 
are running the elections at the moment worry that with more than 
one party they would not be able to function if that happens too 
fast 
the report dealt largely with balloting for the congress of 
peoples deputies last march in which 2250 legislators were 
elected some communist party leaders were defeated and the results 
were widely interpreted as an embarrassment for oldstyle party 
apparatchiks 
the report left the impression that soviet democracy is now 
developing so fast that it has produced confusion on virtually every 
level a feeling that was reflected in comments by team members at 
the new conference 
procedures are poorly understood and varied from place to place 
said mcdonald 
soviet officials were not quite clear how far they wanted to go 
and what the end result might be there is a real battle going 
on over who should control local elections in the 15 soviet 
republics he said 
no date has been set for those elections and it is not clear 
whether they will be run by the central electoral commission or 
local officials commissioners said soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev announced last july that the local elections which had 
been postponed from the fall till next spring might be held by the 
end of this year 
the latest word is that it might be in december said 
mcdonald 
in terms of the electoral process they are going to have to 
turn a lot over to the locals because they simply dont have the 
wherewithal at the national level he said 
the confusion was greatest outside of major population centers 
said richard w soudriette the director of the international 
foundation for electoral systems a nonprofit private group that 
helped sponsor the study 
soviet officials told the team that they did have quite a bit 
of difficulty in some of the outlying republics the farther 
that you got away from the metropolitan areas leningrad moscow 
kiev they increasingly encountered problems said soudriette 
ussoviet cooperation will continue the us commissioners 
said as the americans respond to soviet requests for copies of 
federal and state laws on elections fundraising and advertising 
late tuesday said mcdonald soviet embassy officials telephoned 
the american commission to relay a request for a soviet team to 
observe local elections in new jersey and virginia

an arab league committee resumed 
efforts to end the bloodshed in lebanon on wednesday six weeks 
after suspending its mission because of syrian intransigence 
the official saudi press agency said the foreign ministers of 
saudi arabia algeria and morocco met for 2 hours wednesday night 
deliberations were to continue behind closed doors thursday 
the resumption of the effort was coupled with statements of 
support from arab and international powers especially the united 
states the soviet union and france 
king fahd of saudi arabia an influential arab leader voiced 
optimism tuesday about the chances of a ceasefire in the latest 
confrontation between christians and a moslemsyrian alliance 
upon arriving in the red sea port of jiddah for the meeting 
moroccos foreign minister abdellatif filali said the committee has 
secured clarifications and guarantees but would not 
elaborate 
these he told the saudi news agency would enable him algerias 
bouallam bilsayeh and saudi arabias prince saud alfaisal to work 
anew to reach the appropriate solutions for lebanese national 
reconciliation 
the three ministers met the last time in algiers on july 31 when 
they announced they were suspending their mission mainly because 
syria would not accept a timetable for pulling its 40000 troops 
from lebanon 
the syrians moved into lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate in 1976 but they have since become the moslems main 
backers in the 14yearold civil war against the christians 
christian leaders have called for departure of syrian troops as a 
precondition for negotiating a settlement with the moslems 
after nearly four years of relative calm fighting broke out in 
march between christian army units and the syrians at least 850 
people have since been killed and more than 2500 wounded 
syrian vicepresident abdulhalim khaddam on a visit to 
neighboring north yemen said wednesday we should all work 
together to help the committee implement the resolutions of the 
casablanca summit he referred to the toplevel arab league 
conference held in morocco in may 
that summit entrusted fahd moroccos king hassan ii and algerian 
president chadli bendjedid with finding a settlement in lebanon 
within six months 
diplomatic sources said the ministers taking their cue from 
fahds statements tuesday would issue a call for an immediate 
ceasefire the first important and necessary steps toward a 
settlement 
sources in jiddah said the committee was considering a fourstage 
peace plan comprising a comprehensive ceasefire lifting all land 
and naval blockades inviting parliament to talks on a charter of 
political reform and election of a president by the parliament 
within a few weeks

question how do you get rid of three 
bunkers one of which is fortified with 48000 tons of concrete and 
built to withstand the largest projectile that could be fired from a 
world war ii battleship 
answer very slowly 
when state officials began demolition on the bunkers wednesday 
it was the start of a sixmonth leveling process officials have 
undertaken the 45 million project to make way for a new wastewater 
treatment plant that is part of the 61 billion boston harbor 
cleanup 
massachusetts water resources authority officials said it was the 
first time such bunkers have been demolished 
the fort dawes bunkers date back to 1942 during world war ii 
all the islands within broad sound the main shipping channel into 
boston harbor contained manned forts after the war ended in 1945 
the navy used the bunkers for storage 
the first of the bunkers was blown up with 9200 pounds of 
dynamite at 525 pm 
the initial indication is that it was a successful blast 
said chuck allen a construction crew worker at the site we hope 
it broke into pieces of about three feet in diameter but we wont 
know until we start excavating 
more than 40 men were positioned on deer island here wednesday 
afternoon setting out blasting mats and dirt on the sides of the 
bunker to contain flying rock from the explosion in preparation for 
the demolition 
because of the matting all that was visible was a large puff of 
smoke and a quick blast was heard 
its a huge job were here for a year even if it wont take 
that long said mike bissonette construction superintendent for 
jm cashman inc of quincy which began initial work on the site 
in early august 
but bissonette said the 48000ton battery 105 will likely be the 
most difficult bunker to demolish the roof is fortified with 17 
feet of reinforced concrete and the bunker itself has alternating 
earth and concrete walls of between four and nine feet thick with 
45 feet of packed earth at its base 
the third bunker that will be blown up is a personnel control 
room once the central command post for the entire complex it 
consists of 16 feet of reinforced concrete 
the bunkers some buried up to 20 feet are located on deer 
island a remote point on boston harbor at the tip of this city just 
outside boston acres of land surrounding the bunkers were fenced 
off in preparation for the explosion 
at present deer island is both a minimum security prison and a 
sewage treatment plant once a natural island it has since been 
filled in and is accessible by car 
the island will accommodate what is to become the worlds second 
largest sewage treatment plant the existing treatment plant and 
another in boston are responsible for much of boston harbors 
pollution discharging 70 tons of sludge and 400 million gallons of 
treated wastewater every day 
the new plant scheduled to be constructed between 1990 and 1999 
will treat 13 billion gallons of sewage a day and remove about 90 
percent of the pollutants in the water

yugoslavia announced wednesday it 
will soon introduce a new program to battle a 900 percent annual 
inflation rate the highest in europe 
the federal government acted as about 11000 workers staged 
rallies in two belgrade industrial suburbs to protest steeply 
declining living standards and demand a halt in runaway inflation 
the state news agency tanjug said new measures will liberalize 
imports of cheaper foreign goods to compete with expensive domestic 
products but will apparently not include price or wage freezes it 
did not say when the measures would begin 
the government also foresees closing all unprofitable state 
companies which would probably lead to huge layoffs tanjug said 
about 30 percent of the 68 million yugoslavs who now hold jobs in 
state companies operating at a loss could face dismissal 
besides inflation communist yugoslavia is burdened by a 19 
billion foreign debt a 17 percent unemployment rate and an alarming 
increase in labor and ethnic unrest 
about 10000 workers at rakovica chanted antigovernment slogans 
on wednesday and hailed serbian authorities for their support 
speakers demanded immediate antiinflation action by the federal 
government 
in zemun about 1000 zmaj tractor factory workers sent a final 
warning to the government to brake plummeting living standards 
now officially at the mid1960s level belgrade radio reported 
the rallies appeared to be part of a campaign by leaders of 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics to unseat the 
federal government and premier ante markovic 
when he became premier in march markovic a croat said he would 
resign if all six republics do not approve his radical 
marketoriented reforms 
economists in this capital say serbian leaders headed by 
president slobodan milosevic fear a loss of popularity if living 
standards drop further and favor shortterm austerity measures such 
as freezing prices 
serbian politicians claim markovics economic policies favor 
yugoslavias economically most developed regions slovenia and 
croatia at the expense of poorer republics such as serbia 
the communist leaderships of the republics divided between 
reformers and conservatives have been unable to agree on whether to 
introduce an open freemarket economy and more political pluralism 
as a way out of the crisis 
serbias communist party went on the record wednesday as opposing 
the political pluralism adopted in the liberal northern region of 
slovenia and advocated by reformists in the remaining republics

people seeking treatment in emergency rooms in 
many areas of the country are finding a medical gridlock that keeps 
patients waiting hours even days for hospital beds emergency 
physicians said wednesday 
we are on the verge of a major crisis said dr stephan g 
lynn chairman of an american college of emergency physicians task 
force on hospital overcrowding and director of emergency medicine at 
st lukesroosevelt hospital center in new york city 
the pressure on hospital emergency rooms is coming from the 
growing aids epidemic increased illegal drug use and an estimated 
37 million americans who have no health insurance and for whom the 
emergency room is often their only entry to the health care system 
he said 
this burden is exacerbated by medical staff shortages financial 
pressures that are leading a growing number of hospitals to close 
their doors and an inadequate number of nursing home beds lynn 
said 
in some cases patients in emergency rooms in new york city have 
waited for inpatient hospital beds for more than a week lynn said 
and though the problem is most critical in the northeast and on the 
west coast a survey shows emergency rooms across the country are 
backed up 
in a survey 41 state chapters of the american college of 
emergency physicians reported overcrowding problems in emergency 
rooms in their states nine reported no backup problems idaho 
minnesota nebraska new hampshire new mexico north dakota 
oregon utah and wyoming 
this is affecting everybody from the drug abuser to the 
homeless to the business executive said dr charlotte s yeh who 
sits on the colleges board and is chief of emergency medicine at 
the newtonwellesley hospital in newton mass 
lynn and yeh said it is not known whether extended emergency room 
stays have led to more patient deaths but they said the quality of 
care these patients receive often is marginal 
the lights never go out the noise never turns off meals are 
served but on an irregular basis and rarely are as palatable or 
warm as they are on the inpatient side lynn said 
the patient has no access to a telephone and access to a tv is 
beyond thought he said the patient is lucky if they are able 
to see their visitors and they spend their entire stay lying on a 
stretcher with a mattress that is twoinches thick 
that level of care is inadequate he said emergency 
departments were not designed and are not equipped or staffed to 
provide intensive care services or inpatient services 
at harbor ucla medical center in los angeles the emergency room 
is so overcrowded it is closed to ambulance traffic 25 percent of 
the time said dr robert hockberger chairman of the department of 
emergency medicine 
that results in ambulances wandering around the city trying to 
find emergency departments that are open he said this is 
starting to affect not only the poor barrio gang member who got 
stabbed in the midst of a crack deal but its also affecting the 
50yearold quartermilliondollarayear businessman 
cities on the two coasts have been hit most severely by the 
overcrowding problem but the colleges chapters in west virginia 
north carolina alabama and alaska said overcrowding is not simply 
a problem of this nations cities according to a draft report by 
the task force 
it is ultimately going to come down to the public at large to 
decide if you want care when you want it and where you want it 
youre going to have to put in the resources for it said yeh 
if you dont put in the resources youre going to have to change 
your expectations and expect the wait and expect the fact that 
youre going to have limited care and limited access

the president of namibias independence 
movement will end a 30year exile and return to his homeland despite 
the assassination of another nationalist leader officials said 
wednesday 
a namibian newspaper on wednesday said callers claiming to 
represent a white supremacist group claimed responsibility for the 
killing tuesday of anton lubowski an official of the southwest 
africa peoples organization 
sam nujoma president of the nationalist group will return 
thursday even though there have been threats against his life the 
organization said in a statement nujoma has lived principally in 
angola during his selfimposed exile 
posters appeared in windhoek on wednesday with a photograph of 
nujoma and a target superimposed on his face 
nujoma is returning to namibia to take charge of his groups 
campaign for elections scheduled for early november a prelude to 
namibian independence from south africa 
south africa which ruled namibia 74 years has agreed to 
implement independence in the territory under united nations 
supervision independence is expected early next year 
lubowski a namibian lawyer and the nationalist groups 
topranking white official was shot in the head outside his home in 
a windhoek suburb 
the 37yearold lubowksi was widely known abroad and his killing 
was condemned by officials from the united states britain west 
germany norway sweden amd zambia among others 
gwen lister editor of the namibian said she received two phone 
calls wednesday from men saying they belonged to the white wolves 
and that the white supremacist organization killed lubowski 
ms lister said one of the callers also threatened her for 
supporting the the southwest africa peoples organization the 
blackdominated movement that waged a 23year guerrilla war against 
south african rule of namibia 
men identifying themselves as whites wolves have carried out 
several attacks on blacks and antiapartheid activists in south 
africa police say they have not been able to prove the organization 
exists 
the southwest africa peoples organizations election 
directorate of which lubowski was a member said in a statement 
that the deliberate and wellcalculated killing was intended to 
create instability in the period prior to the elections 
such a cowardly act is part of the notorious scheme aimed at 
scaring namibian patriots from giving a heros welcome to their 
national leader nujoma the statement said it is also aimed 
at frightening the white community in namibia which has been 
increasingly joining swapo over the past weeks and months 
fighting between nationalist guerrillas and the south africanled 
security forces ended in april since then there have been only 
isolated violent incidents 
lubowski died only hours after namibias nine largest political 
parties including the southwest africa peoples organization 
signed a code of conduct for the elections that prohibits violence 
i wish to assure namibians that their desire for a peaceful 
transition to independence too long delayed cannot and will not be 
frustrated by the increasingly desperate acts of a few extremists 
said martti ahtisaari head of the un operation in namibia 
the south africanappointed administrator of namibia louis 
pienaar said authorities will not allow circumstances of anarchy 
to develop in the runup to the election he promised tight 
security for nujomas return 
pienaar said the assassination was part of a spiral of 
violence that included the fatal stoning of a white police officer 
during the weekend by a crowd of blacks 
lubowski announced in 1984 that he had joined the legal political 
wing of southwest africa peoples organization 
since then rightwing newspapers often ridiculed him in stories 
and cartoons critical of the leftistoriented organization he had 
received numerous death threats 
police offered what they called a substantial reward for 
information about the killing but did not disclose a specific 
figure

syrians and christians clashed with artillery mortars and machine 
guns in beirut north lebanon and the mountains on the eastern edge 
of the christian heartland 
he said residential sectors of the capital badly hammered since 
fighting erupted march 8 were spared in the sporadic clashes 
the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria met in 
saudi arabias red sea port of jiddah for 2 hours late wednesday 
resuming a peace effort that ran out of steam six weeks ago 
deliberations were to continue behind closed doors on thursday 
the envoys on july 31 blamed syria for refusing to accept a 
timetable for pulling its 40000 troops from lebanon 
christian leader gen michel aoun in what appeared to be a 
compromise proposal said even a partial syrian withdrawal would 
open the way for negotiations on political reforms to end the 
14yearold civil war 
the syrians who consider lebanon vital to their strategic 
defense against israel have refused to withdraw 
informed sources in jiddah speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the arab mediation committee was considering a peace plan that 
calls for a ceasefire and the lifting of blockades by both sides 
beiruts independent annahar daily the leftist assafir as well 
as moslem and christian radio stations said the committee will 
declare a ceasefire shortly 
several ceasefires called by the arab league and others have 
collapsed amid fierce artillery battles that have driven an 
estimated 90 percent of beiruts 15 million people from the city 
annahar said the nationalist front a coalition of 18 leftist 
and moslem groups allied with syria and iran was expected to 
facilitate the committees effort by proclaiming a ceasefire in 
the coming hours 
the front formed more than a month ago in an attempt by syria 
and iran to intensify the pressure on aoun generally reflects 
syrian president hafez assads policy in lebanon 
but sources in damascus speaking on condition of anonymity said 
no ceasefire announcement was imminent and did not indicate any 
significant shift in the syrians stand 
annahar said the nationalist front will also lift the maritime 
blockade imposed by syria on the 310squaremile christian enclave 
in midmarch 
assafir which is close to assads government said the arab 
foreign ministers meeting in jiddah will discuss complete 
stabilization of a ceasefire to pave the way for talks between 
the warring factions 
aoun a maronite catholic said he was prepared to accept 
radical reforms to the political system that has given the 
christians the upper hand in running lebanon since independence from 
france in 1943 
when the french pulled out the christians were considered the 
majority but now the moslems comprise an estimated 55 percent of 
the countrys 4 million people and want equal political power 
aoun has declared a war of liberation against the syrians 
whom he views as an occupying power 
syria sent its troops into lebanon in june 1976 under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate aoun charges they have abrogated that 
mandate by siding with the moslems

nicaragua has denied visas to members of a 
privately funded delegation of americans who wanted to monitor 
prepartions for its february national elections the embassy said 
wednesday 
our elections are not something to be manipulated by 
individuals and groups interested in furthering conflict charge 
daffairs leonor arguella de huper said in announcing that the 
commission on free and fair elections in nicaragua would not receive 
the requested visas 
the embassy said l brent bozell president of the conservative 
world freedom foundation sponsor of the commission had just 
returned from a visit to contra camps in honduras and expressed his 
support for the contras 
it is known that the world freedom foundations sole objective 
is to discredit our electoral process and create conditions for a 
revival of the contra war mrs huper said 
former democratic sen gaylord nelson of wisconsin a cochairman 
of the commission called mrs de hupers statement sheer 
nonsense 
this is a bipartisan commission whose sole interest was in 
observing and helping to promote free and fair elections in 
nicaragua it has no other purpose whatsoever nelson said 
commission director marc ryan said visas were sought for nelson 
commission cochairman curtin winsor jr a former ambassador to 
costa rica in the reagan administration sergio bendixen a 
democratic political consultant alan keyes a former assistant 
secretary of state in the reagan administration and elaine kamarck 
a democratic political activist 
ryan who said he and bozell also had wanted visas said the 
group might ask mrs de huper to reconsider 
i find it terribly disturbing that the sandinistas are saying 
basically you must be vocally anticontra to be allowed to observe 
this election bozell said 
as far as i am concerned i bent over backward trying to find a 
glimmer of hope in these elections but this action by the 
sandinistas is a major nail in the coffin on that expectation 
the action came just days after the united states and nicaragua 
had their first highlevel contact in nearly five years 
janet mullins an assistant secretary of state joined in a 
meeting with nicaraguan president daniel ortega ms mullins joined 
a congressional delegation for the weekend meeting which was part 
of a visit to several central american countries the state 
department said wednesday 
highlevel contacts were barred by president reagan in january 
1985 after officials accused nicaragua of negotiating in bad faith 
during sixmonthlong talks the bush administration has not 
observed a similar policy

a barrage of rockets crashed into kabul 
airport wednesday after a weeklong lull killing at least one person 
and damaging airplanes including a un peacekeepers jet officials 
and witnesses said 
also wednesday a commander for the usbacked guerrillas 
announced his fighters have started a northern offensive to cut 
soviet supply routes to kabul 
in the south guerrillas reportedly pushed back a 1000vehicle 
army convoy with winter provisions for the countrys second largest 
city kandahar 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said 14 rockets 
struck in and around the capitals joint militarycivilian airport 
however airport workers and other witnesses put the number at 25 or 
more 
more than 300 people have been killed and 700 injured in almost 
daily rocket attacks since june by the guerrillas 
amani said shrapnel from one explosion wednesday killed a 
firefighter at the airports fire station 
he said one rocket also hit a mosque in the neighborhood of bibi 
mahro next to the airport killing a priest and wounding four other 
people 
however several residents interviewed by reporters around the 
mosque said no rockets fell and nobody was killed or injured 
airport workers and other witnesses said at least one soldier was 
killed and three wounded but amani said he had no information about 
those casualties 
amani said shrapnel from another rocket knocked holes in the 
fuselage of a un jet and also damaged a tupolov 154 jet belonging 
to ariana the national airlines 
un officials said they patched the holes with special metal 
tape they said no one was injured by the rocket however 
the plane arrived carrying benom sevann spokesman for un 
observers monitoring the 10yearold civil war between the 
sovietbacked afghan government and the moslem guerrillas who are 
also backed by pakistan 
airport workers also said a sovietdesigned antonov12 caught 
fire when it was hit by a rocket while taxiing toward the runway 
they said the crew jumped off 
however a government spokesman said the plane had not burned 
the marxist government uses the planes to ferry military 
equipment food and other supplies to provincial capitals around the 
country because the guerrillas control the roads in many rural areas 
in neighboring pakistan western diplomatic sources said a huge 
afghan army convoy of trucks tanks and armored personnel carriers 
from the soviet union was turned back from kandahar by fierce 
guerrilla attacks 
its original size reportedly was 1000 to 1300 vehicles but 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
insurgents may have destroyed more than 110 vehicles 
afghan government officials said the convoy was carrying 
provisions for 200000 people in besieged kandahar 
the convoy had pushed to within 36 miles of kandahar before it 
was forced back the diplomatic sources said 
at latest report the column had retreated 33 miles and split 
into two with helicopters lifting some of the cargo to kandahar 
meanwhile guerrilla commander ahmad shah masoud sent a radio 
message to pakistan where the insurgents are based saying his 
forces were attacking four areas along the key salang highway north 
of kabul including the governments biggest air force base at 
bagram 
his message gave us no details about casualties but he said 
the mujahedeen guerrillas gained some very big successes 
especially at salang said masoud khalili a spokesman of the 
jamiatiislami rebel group 
the diplomatic sources said intense fighting continued around the 
eastern garrison town of khost with high casualties on both sides 
the guerrillas have failed to capture a major afghan city since 
the last soviet forces withdrew from the civil war on feb 15 the 
soviets still supply the government with weapons

sri lankan political parties and tamil 
rebel groups opened a conference wednesday to seek a way to end this 
lands ethnic violence that has killed more than 16000 people 
however the same day reports said 27 more people were killed 
and 13 government buildings were burned in the strife 
a government spokesman said 21 of the countrys 27 recognized 
political parties attended the conference in colombo president 
ranasinghe premadasa said it was expected to continue through oct 
12 
i abhor violence i believe in nonviolence i wish to make a 
special appeal to all those outside the democratic process to return 
to the mainstream join the dialogue to jointly search for solutions 
to the countrys problems premadasa said in his opening statement 
to the conference 
the appeal was apparently aimed at sinhalese radicals of the 
peoples liberation front an ultranationalist guerrilla group 
trying to overthrow the government 
the front boycotted the conference organized by the 
sinhalesedominated government however bradman weerakoon foreign 
affairs adviser to the president said premadasa was confident the 
radicals would attend later meetings 
more than 16000 people have died in six years of ethnic violence 
on this indian ocean island at least 5000 of them have been killed 
in the twoyearold sinhalese uprising a revolt by minority tamil 
secessionists in the northeast has claimed the other lives 
delegates at wednesdays meeting included members of five tamil 
guerrilla groups among them the liberation tigers of tamil eelam a 
leading group that continued fighting despite a failing peace accord 
in 1987 
all political parties and groups who are represented at this 
meeting have placed as their first priority the cessation of 
violence and restoration of peace and normalcy in our country 
premadasa told the 69 conference delegates 
he said he would consider proposals made by some parties to 
restore peace including formation of a provisional government 
constitutional reforms and replacement of the presidential system 
with a britishstyle parliamentary government 
i am not adverse to change if change is to bring forth desired 
results i believe that we must search for new solutions to the new 
problems we face he said 
less than an hour before the conference began a car bomb 
exploded in a parking lot in downtown colombo shattering some 
windows but causing no casualties police said no one claimed 
responsibility but police blamed the front 
a government statement said suspected front members burned 13 
government buildings wednesday in moneragala district 100 miles 
east of colombo 
it said nine bodies of young sinhalese men were found wednesday 
in kurunegala district 85 miles northeast of colombo 
such killings have also been blamed on the sinhalese opponents of 
the government 
also wednesday four civilians were killed in central sri lanka 
six bodies were found near a governmentowned housing complex in 
moratuwa a colombo suburb and five burned bodies of sinhalese 
women were found in central kandy district the statement said 
it also said sinhalese radicals shot and killed three policemen 
on a foot patrol wednesday near galnewa village 100 miles north of 
colombo 
the violence broke out in 1983 with a tamil insurrection in the 
northeast tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people claim the government deprives them of jobs and education 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and the military 
indian peacekeeping forces came to sri lanka under the 1987 
accord but they too have been caught up in the fighting sri lankan 
officials say the indians have agreed to pull out their troops by 
the end of the year

senate democrats courting a showdown with the 
white house said wednesday that president bushs 79 billion 
antidrug package was inadequate and vowed to press their own more 
costly plan unless republicans agreed to major expansions 
the democrats made their decision in a closed strategy session as 
drug coordinator william bennett continued his defense of the 
administrations plan saying the blueprint was our best 
assessment of what is needed to combat illegal drugs 
is it impossible to spend more no bennett told a house 
committee but added it is unclear where more money could be used 
effectively the democrats want to up the spending by 22 billion 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said democrats 
have offered to negotiate on a compromise with the white house and 
republicans 
the presidents plan must be improved mitchell told 
reporters its goals must be set higher its strategies to meet 
the goals must be changed 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas met with mitchell and 
said afterward that the two sides hoped to begin talks soon 
my own view is that the bush plan does not need any changes 
but if there are good suggestions and if we get some agreement 
between the president and congress then obviously that is fine 
dole said 
democrats emerged from their meeting saying the proposal by sen 
robert byrd dwva to add the 22 billion to bushs total by 
cutting a half percent from the budgets of other programs had their 
support 
if we cant find that in everybodys department were not 
serious about fighting the war on drugs said sen john breaux 
dla predicting that most democrats would fall into line behind 
byrds plan 
i think the democrats want to do something on drugs and they 
want to do it now said sen dennis deconcini dariz 
since last week when bush proposed his 79 billion plan to 
combat drug abuse next year democrats and republicans have sought 
tactical advantages on an issue that polls show is of intense public 
concern 
the white house has signaled it is willing to try to find middle 
ground although the office of management and budget issued a 
statement on tuesday saying that top administration officials would 
urge a veto if democrats passed their own plan intact 
elsewhere in congress a former worker in a colombian drug cartel 
warned that embattled south american drug dealers might lash out 
with terror attacks in the united states 
some of you may be the victims of attacks and maybe the 
president of the united states would be the victim of drug 
traffickers diego viafara salinas told the senate permanent 
subcommittee on investigations in comments that paralleled remarks 
made earlier in the week by an fbi official 
he testified behiond a screen to shield his identity while 
bodyguards scanned the hearing room 
democrats initially criticized the president for proposing new 
programs without specifying where much of the money was supposed to 
come from some said new taxes were needed for any serious antidrug 
effort 
byrd the senate appropriations committee chairman surprised 
republicans on tuesday by advancing a proposal to add 39 billion 
to the 62 billion congress had planned to spend on antidrug 
programs he proposed raising the money by trimming defense and many 
domestic programs by 0575 percent 
the 101 billion total in byrds package would be 22 billion 
beyond the presidents figure his additional spending would include 
11 billion for treatment and prevention programs and 1 billion 
for new prisons 
republicans however say the byrd plan is too expensive and 
would take an unacceptable 18 billion bite out of the pentagons 
budget 
bennett told the house select committee on narcotics abuse and 
control wednesday that the presidents proposal represents our 
best assessment of what is needed 
the strategy seeks 925 million for treatment a 53 percent 
increase over this years amount and 12 billion for prevention 
and education a 25 percent increase 
bennett said some efforts dont need more money just more 
stringent policies 
school policy clear firm school policy is probably about 
the most effective thing you can do and it costs no more to have a 
sound policy that to have an unsound policy he said 
bennett also defended the way bushs plan distributes money 70 
percent for law enforcement and 30 percent for education and 
treatment byrds plan would be split 5347 respectively 
it is a function of what we think needs to be done what needs 
to be done now and what needs to be done by the federal 
government bennett said 
meanwhile viafara salinas a onetime colombian cartel health 
officer who is a federally protected witness warned senators that 
south american drug dealers could spread terror within the united 
states and possibly attack officials here if the crackdown 
intensifies 
another witness testifying from behind a screen david wheeler 
the washingtonborn son of a us foreign service officer said 
wealthy bolivians have a cocaine cartel that rivals those of 
colombia 
he said he gained the confidence of cocaine dealers after living 
20 years in mexico growing marijuana and shipping it to the united 
states 
the cocaine cartels seeking new ways to smuggle the drug into 
this country are considering buying surplus diesel submarines 
wheeler testified he said they are buying land on both sides of the 
southwest border with an eye to tunneling and piping in narcotics

hungary said on wednesday its agreements 
limiting movement of east bloc citizens are out of step with its 
human rights commitments and that the government will seek to revise 
them 
deputy foreign minister ferenc somogyi also said hungary will 
continue to dismantle border barriers but does not plan to be a 
springboard to the west 
somogyi said budapests decision this week to allow the exodus of 
more than 12000 east germans to the west was a unique step 
an east german communist party newspaper the youth daily junge 
welt on wednesday for the first time called for a look at why east 
germans flee their homeland 
however the main party daily neues deutschland continued its 
criticism of west germany which it contends lured the refugees 
west it also criticized hungary for allowing their unsanctioned 
departure 
in austria border authorities said the number of east germans 
crossing from hungary en route to west germany climbed to 12545 
since the freedom convoy began at midnight sunday 
bavarian border police gave a similar estimate and said the push 
to the west had peaked 
polish television meanwhile reported that about 50 east germans 
seeking a new life in the west took refuge in the west german 
embassy in warsaw 
the telexpress tv news program showed pictures of the refugees 
including children at play in the embassy courtyard 
they are following dozens of others who recently sought refuge at 
west german embassies in czechoslovakia and hungary 
budapests reformminded government risking censure from its 
warsaw pact allies and courting western praise allowed the east 
germans to leave for west germany via austria 
its decision to defy an ally and work together with west germany 
to let the east germans emigrate marks the first time a warsaw pact 
country has cooperated with a nato nation to help citizens of an 
allied country resettle in the west 
but in prague about 300 refugees gave up tuesday and wednesday 
and left the embassy compound after east berlin promised they would 
be allowed to apply to emigrate legally the czechoslovak news 
agency ctk reported it said up to 150 east germans remain inside 
polish media have reported on the exodus but there has been no 
comment from the warsaw government the first east bloc 
administration led by noncommunists hungary also is pressing for 
major reforms 
east germany remains one of the most rigidly controlled states 
and refuses to consider demands for change sweeping the communist 
world 
but on wednesday junge welt said even a minority of healthy 
young people vital to the economy should not be enticed away by 
better living standards 
how do we make this country indisputably the focal point for 
dedication and happiness for every individual how do we make it a 
homeland for even more people in which one accepts burdens and from 
which one is not lured away just by shop windows full of bananas or 
glossy travel guides it asked 
east german refugees say they were tired of political repression 
and economic stagnation 
in a formal protest tuesday east germany accused hungary of 
violating bilateral agreements and interfering with east german 
sovereignty czechoslovakia and romania also were critical 
hungarys foreign ministry in a terse note carried by the 
official mti news agency said wednesday it would extensively 
contradict the east german accusations it did not say when 
as part of its reforms hungary became the first soviet bloc 
nation to join the un convention on refugees rights it came into 
force june 12 and officials have said they plan to change domestic 
laws and international agreements to dovetail with the accord 
with its release of the east german refugees hungary suspended a 
1969 agreement with east germany which in effect stipulated that no 
east german could leave for the west without east berlins 
permission 
somogyi said similar agreements with other warsaw pact countries 
are no longer in line with our newly assumed international 
responsibilities 
but officials have insisted for months that hungary does not 
intend to become a springboard to the west 
somogyi said anybody including citizens of soviet bloc nations 
could apply for refugee status and would be given a fair hearing 
he emphasized that the current situation was temporary and limited 
to east germans 
this decision to allow east german citizens to leave for the 
west was a unique step he said it pertains only to east german 
citizens and in no way can it be interpreted as applying to 
citizens of other warsaw pact nations 
he said hungary in the future will work under the criteria of the 
geneva convention forbidding signatories to return to their 
countries refugees whose life or freedom would be threatened on 
account of his race religion nationality or political 
opinion 
signatories also can only allow the exit of refugees welcomed by 
a third country west germany recognizes all east germans as 
citizens but few nations are willing to accept refugees from 
romania bulgaria and czechoslovakia which have also been slow to 
introduce reform 
officials have acknowledged that tensions with romania were 
partially responsible for hungarys decision to join the convention 
hungary began sheltering romanian refugees in january 1988 breaking 
an agreement with its southeastern neighbor to send back citizens 
seeking asylum 
about 17000 romanian nationals have fled most of them ethnic 
hungarians in the first instance of one warsaw pact country giving 
permanent sanctuary to citizens of another on grounds of alleged 
persecution

an east german communist party newspaper on 
wednesday for the first time called for the country to take a look 
at why east germans flee their homeland 
how do we make it a homeland from which one is not lured 
away just by shop windows full of bananas or glossy travel guides 
asked the paper junge welt or young world 
refugees at camps in west germany meanwhile made a beeline for 
blue jeans among clothing donated to help start their new lives in 
the west 
the big thing for these people is bluejean clothing 
bluejean trousers bluejean skirts and bluejean jackets said 
amanda dropalla who was overseeing distribution of secondhand 
clothes at passau 
other new arrivals were being interviewed for jobs 
at a park near hamburg some began setting up temporary 
households in 60 mobile homes 
they are among more than 12500 refugees who fled as east 
european leaders face demands for democratic change poland has 
installed the east blocs first government led by noncommunists 
and hungarys leaders promise free elections but east germany 
remains among the most rigid communist nations 
new arrivals in west germany many young skilled craftsmen say 
they were dissatisfied with the stagnating economy and political 
oppression in their communist homeland 
junge welt which often reflects official views said east 
germans no longer can avoid discussing why a minority fled the 
country of 166 million people 
how do we make this country indisputably the focal point for 
dedication and happiness for every individual the newspaper asked 
but the main east german party daily neues deutschland 
continued its criticism of west germany which it contends has 
lured the refugees west 
it also criticized hungary for allowing their unsanctioned 
departure 
west germanys die welt newspaper quoted a founding member of a 
reform movement in east germany as saying demands for change are 
increasing dramatically 
things are breaking up with some wanting to go west and others 
looking for a changed east germany it quoted hansjochen 
tschiche as saying 
he told die welt that his neues forum or new forum considers 
itself a platform for smaller reform movements across east germany 
tschiche said he sees the possibility of achieving a 
reorganization of the german democratic republic east germany 
with reformminded people within the communist party die welt 
reported 
meanwhile western diplomats in east berlin said east german 
leader erich honecker is still recovering slowly from two 
gallbladder operations 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
77yearold honecker is so weak he is able to leave his bed for only 
a halfhour at a time 
they said his life is not in danger but he is in no condition to 
resume his duties 
east german officials concede honeckers recovery has been slow

a teenager called police wednesday to rescue five 
younger siblings from a house containing cocaine and guns even 
though he was a fugitive from a new jersey youth detention center 
police said 
police arrested the 16yearold from newark but released him 
later when new jersey officials declined to seek his return 
he must have been scared to death said jill reilly a boston 
police spokeswoman 
the youth called police at about 1 am after he allegedly was 
robbed at gunpoint near the home where the children were staying in 
dorchester a section of boston where drugrelated violence is 
common 
when police arrived the juvenile told them he was afraid the 
children ages one through 12 were in danger reilly said 
the teenager said jimmy lee pettway 35 who lived in the house 
threatened him with a 22caliber pistol and grabbed his watch 
reilly said pettway told police he was babysitting the children 
the officers believed the children were in danger reilly 
said and they entered the house they found eight grams of cocaine 
scales and lots and lots of other drug paraphernalia as well as 
several rifles in plain view in a closet she said 
pettway 35 was charged with armed robbery carrying a firearm 
and possession with intent to distribute drugs said david rodman a 
spokesman for the suffolk county district attorneys office 
another man at the scene james young 43 was also charged with 
assault with a dangerous weapon possession of a firearm and 
possession with intent to distribute rodman said and a woman at 
the scene theresa clark 22 also known as claude the mother of a 
2yearold who was a sixth child in the house was charged with 
possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to violate drug 
laws 
all three pleaded innocent to the charges and were released on 
personal recognizance rodman said 
police also arrested the 16yearold who called them but rodman 
said he was released later wednesday when new jersey authorities 
declined to seek his return to the state on a robbery charge 
new jersey said they dont want him so we let him go rodman 
said he didnt do anything wrong 
officials in the essex county sheriffs office in new jersey 
would not comment on the case because it involves a juvenile newark 
police did not return telephone messages 
boston police brought in gladys williams the mother of the 
juvenile and the other five children for questioning when she 
arrived at the house later in the morning williams whose age was 
not available told police she originally was from new jersey but 
had been living in the dorchester house for about two months 
the state department of social services was granted temporary 
custody of the six children and they will be placed in foster care

the house interior committee decided thursday 
that coal mines all over the country should pay for cleaning up 
abandoned strip mines rejecting arguments of western states that it 
was unfair to tax them for eastern cleanups 
on a 2711 vote the panel sent to the full house a bill 
providing a 15year extension of the mine reclamation tax with 
special provisions that may let western states pay at a reduced rate 
western coal producers want an end to the tax because all their 
abandoned coal mine projects are on track for completion by the end 
of 1992 when coal minings version of superfund is scheduled to 
expire 
rep larry craig ridaho argued that the federal program has 
served its purpose and further reclamation should fall to the states 
he said its unfair to ask one segment of the mining industry to 
take care of another segments problems western coal interests 
would end up subsidizing eastern projects he argued 
the office of surface mining estimates another 4 billion in 
highpriority problems will remain in the east after 1992 
lawmakers from eastern coal states argued that the nation as a 
whole benefited from the coal mined in appalachia and is responsible 
for damage left behind 
this is the coal that fueled the industrial revolution said 
rep nick rahall dwva 
saying open shafts contaminated water and burning refuse piles 
are local or regional concerns is like arguing that a state without 
superfund sites should be exempted from paying into the toxic 
cleanupfund he said 
just as we have declared a war on drugs so must we protect 
coalfield citizens from the health safety and environmental hazards 
they face on a daily basis said rahall who came up with a 
compromise that cuts in half the tax paid by coal producers 
operating in states where abandoned mine projects have been 
completed 
the legislation ready for house consideration includes that 50 
percent cut 
the tax currrently is uniform nationwide 35 cents per ton of 
surfacemined coal 15 cents per ton of deepmined coal 10 cents 
per ton of lignite 
the legislation would let companies in states certified to have 
finished all mine reclamation work pay 18 cents per ton of 
surfacemined coal 8 cents per ton of deepmined coal and 5 cents 
per ton of lignite 
the tax had collected 22 billion through last sept 30

evangelist oral roberts announced wednesday 
that he will close his city of faith hospital and medical school and 
sell his home to help make up for a 25 million deficit caused by a 
drop in donations 
four other ministryowned homes including his evangelist son 
richards house and an 830unit housing complex for married 
students at oral roberts university here also will be sold roberts 
told a campus news conference 
he said the 777bed hospital would close by jan 1 and the 
medical school which is part of the university would shut down 
with the end of classes next may 
roberts who in 1987 raised 8 million for the medical school 
after saying god would end his life if the money didnt come in 
left open the possibility some miracle could happen but he said 
the action was necessary to save the 4300student university 
i think its one of the best decisions ive ever made the 
71yearold evangelist said i hurt because this is my calling 
but im encouraged that were doing the right thing 
roberts has blamed the sharp decline in donations to his ministry 
on a spirit of skepticism in the wake of scandals involving 
fellow evangelists jim bakker and jimmy swaggart 
he said a 50 million endowment would be needed to prevent the 
closing of the medical complex which roberts has long considered a 
symbol of his medical missionary work 
who knows that when this is known across america that someone 
we might have been dealing with or someone we havent been dealing 
with might say ive got the 50 million roberts said 
he said he had talked to a potential big contributor who might 
have been able to donate the 50 million but the discussions fell 
through 
he hasnt given up yet but he said the economy is just too bad 
now said roberts who would not identify the man 
roberts talked to students faculty and staff of the hospital and 
medical school in an emotional meeting early wednesday to explain 
the crisis afflicting his ministry the oral roberts evangelistic 
association 
he told them that at least half of the 25 million was needed to 
pay vendors and that the remainder was owed for various costs 
including mortages 
i asked the lord to not let me cry because ive cried all the 
tears i thought i could cry and sure enough i didnt cry he 
said 
the five homes and the housing complex will be sold as soon as a 
buyer can be found said mark swadener chief fiscal officer for the 
ministry the homes sit on 9 acres near the 400acre ministry 
complex 
oral roberts 6328squarefoot fourbedroom home was valued at 
about 500000 in 1987 the value of his sons 7091squarefoot 
twostory home was put at 547000 that year 
city of faith hospital employs 600 staff members and the medical 
school has 147 students and about 100 faculty said school dean dr 
larry edwards the 27 seniors at the school will be allowed to 
graduate the other students will be be helped in seeking transfers 
to other medical schools 
its not going to stop me from being a doctor and its not 
going to stop me from being a medical missionary said medical 
student david chorley 
the hospital part of a threetower complex with 60story 
30story and 20story buildings will be leased and the revenue 
generated dedicated to the ministrys endowment roberts said 
swadener would not say how much money the sales and the closings 
would bring 
after the dust has settled well take a look at it he said 
some university students approved roberts action tulsa mayor 
roger randle said he believed the evangelist made the right 
decision we have a shortterm loss but a strengthened ability to 
survive in the long term randle said 
the financial problems involving roberts and his ministry have 
been well chronicled 
roberts 1986 plea for 8 million caused a furor but the money 
was raised 
last march roberts said he needed 11 million to keep creditors 
from dismantling the ministry university and hospital the money 
was needed to pay pastdue bills from more than 4000 vendors he 
said 
the sixweek fund drive which the evangelist termed a 
lifeordeath struggle for his ministry ended successfully in may 
at the time ministry spokeswoman jan dargatz said contributions 
would have to continue at a level of about 33 million per month to 
sustain the medical center the ministry and the university 
monthly contributions to the ministry declined from 5 million to 
27 million ministry officials said 
when roberts built the city of faith which opened in 1981 
officials at tulsas five other hospitals harshly criticized him 
saying tulsa didnt need another hospital 
although the hospital has 777 beds it is licensed for no more 
than 294 patients and has never had an annual average higher than 
148 
roberts announced in may that the universitys athletic programs 
were dropping out of national collegiate athletic association 
competition immediately to save an estimated 500000 to 1 million 
a year 
the ministry also canceled contracts with some commercial 
television stations that had been airing the daily show hosted by 
richard roberts 41 
oral roberts university has more than 4300 undergraduate and 
graduate students

dogs whose owners smoke are at a 50 
percent greater risk of getting lung cancer a health researcher 
said wednesday 
a colorado state university study examined 51 cases of dogs with 
lung cancer from the files of veterinary teaching hospitals at the 
university and the university of illinois 
dogs dont smoke and lung cancer is extremely rare in dogs 
said john reif a colorado state environmental health professor at 
colorado states college of veterinary medicine and biomedical 
sciences 
reif said the study of dog cancer cases had shown a relationship 
between exposure to secondhand smoke and canine lung cancer and that 
it could help research on the effect of such smoke on humans 
studies have shown a relationship between secondhand smoke and lung 
cancer in humans 
reif and his associates interviewed the dogs owners about their 
smoking habits and determined that 24 of the 51 dogs or 47 
percent had owners who smoked 
the researchers also looked at a control group of 83 dogs with 
other forms of cancer of that group 31 dogs or 37 percent had 
smokers as owners reif said 
based on those findings the researchers concluded that dogs with 
owners who smoke were 50 percent more likely to get lung cancer 
reif said the number of dogs in the study was low because of the 
rarity of lung cancer in dogs of 15000 dogs seen by the colorado 
state hospital just five had the disease the researcher said there 
were no national figures 
reid presented the study findings at the annual meeting in july 
of the american veterinary medical association in orlando fla 
reif said he hopes to study more dogs he said dogs make a good 
model for the study of secondhand smokes effects because they lead 
relatively simple lives 
peoples lives are highly variable exposure to passive smoke 
in the workplace and at home as well as to occupational 
environmental hazards can be health risks and make it difficult 
to assess secondhand smokes effect he said 
reif said future studies might look at the effect of secondhand 
smoke on canine nasal cancer 
unlike humans who have short nasal passages that cause smoke 
particles to lodge more often in the lungs dogs filter the air they 
breathe through a relatively long nasal passage where many smoke 
particles lodge 
nasal cancer is more common in dogs making a larger study group 
possible reif said

the senate failed by a single vote wednesday to 
override president bushs veto of congressional restrictions on the 
coproduction of a jet fighter with japan 
the 6634 vote one vote short of the required twothirds 
majority came after a debate in which both the white house and 
congress were accused of trying to monopolize the power to regulate 
the nations international trade 
in the debate bush supporters said the legislation represented a 
serious erosion of the powers of the presidency and would force 
renegotiation of the terms of the fsx production contract between 
the two nations 
the vote means japan can go ahead with the fighter an updated 
version of the general dynamics corp f16 under the deal 
negotiated with the bush administration 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas pleaded with 
colleagues not to aggravate the president and to sustain bushs veto 
of legislation dole called meddling micromanagement and not 
constructive 
senate robert c byrd dwva the principal sponsor of the fsx 
resolution told the senate that the fsx resolution is too 
important to have a turf battle over declaring that it improves 
the terms of the deal for the united states 
senators seeking to overturn the veto said it represented a white 
house power grab in the international trade arena and a direct 
threat to the constitutional power of congress to regulate trade 
sen john c danforth rmo said the fsx legislation does not 
derail the coproduction deal which he said is in place and cannot 
be undone 
this debate is about the drawing of lines between the president 
and the congress on international trade issues danforth said 
if the president is correct in his view then he has succeeded in 
dramatically shifting the line from where it has been 
if we agree with the veto then there has been a very 
substantial rollback in the authority of the congress of the united 
states on issues related to international trade he said this 
is trying to muscle the other fellow off the beach 
but sen richard lugar rind contended that in passing the fsx 
resolution on a 7227 roll call the senate overreached and 
moved to usurp the presidents proper authority under the 
constitution 
the president of the united states has not attempted to strip 
the congress of any constitutional power whatsoever lugar said 
he said the president is contending that the executive branch 
retains the right to negotiate agreements with other nations and 
that the senate has the right to approve or reject them 
he appealed to the senate to let the agreement with japan go 
forward on grounds it is in the us national interest and not to 
foul it up with mischief legislation 
bush vetoed the fsx resolution on july 31 saying i cannot 
accept binding provisions that would tie my hands in the 
exercise of my constitutional responsibilities 
he said the legislation would inject the general accounting 
office an agency of the legislative branch into the administration 
of the jet program in a highly intrusive manner trespassing on 
the constitutional powers of the president 
to reopen discussions now for additional and needless changes 
can only damage the prospects for a successful agreement the 
president said 
if this occurs substantial injury to the usjapan security 
relationship is likely and the considerable strategic and commercial 
benefits to the united states will be lost 
the agreement negotiated earlier this year by bush 
administration officials with officials of the japanese government 
calls for development by general dynamics and mitsubishi heavy 
industries of an advanced version of the f16 fighter named fsx to 
be deployed by japan in the 1990s the deal envisions a 6 billion 
price tag

mayor tom bradley walked a gray area of the 
law as a paid consultant to two savings banks doing business with 
the city but evidence is insufficient to prosecute him the city 
attorney said wednesday 
bradley instead faces a civil lawsuit that alleges six violations 
of failing to report investments two of them in excess of 100000 
city attorney james hahn filed the lawsuit in los angeles 
superior court at about the same time as he released a 1613page 
report on the mayors conduct the report was based on a fivemonth 
investigation by hahns office into bradleys relationship with far 
east national bank and valley federal savings and loan association 
no vindication of the mayors conduct is intended implied or 
should in any way be inferred hahn wrote in the report the 
mayor clearly stepped into that gray area of the law between factual 
innocence and a chargeable offense 
the mayor said the report confirmed his earlier statements that 
he broke no conflictofinterest laws 
i would never do anything to harm los angeles he said in a 
locally televised afternoon speech i will not let you down 
in the lengthy speech bradley said that he saw no connection 
between accepting consulting fees from a bank and the city 
treasurers decisions to deposit city money in the bank 
the two have nothing to do with one another he said 
although hahn described his fivemonth investigation as 
exhaustive and unprecedented in scope and purpose it was 
limited to a narrow range of questions about the mayors outside 
financial dealings 
still unresolved are questions about possible illegalities 
involving a cityfunded task force for africa bradleys ties to the 
investment banking firm of drexel burnham lambert inc and an 
alleged coverup by the city treasurers office 
hahn said it was apparent that a march 22 telephone call from 
bradley to city treasurer leonard rittenberg influenced rittenberg 
to deposit 2 million in city funds with far east national bank 
bradley was paid 18000 as a consultant to far east 
it was also obvious hahn said that someone altered financial 
bid sheets following a reporters inquiry about the far east 
deposit a section of the bid sheets that contained the words per 
the mayor had been blotted out 
theres no question in my mind that there was a coverup but 
we could find no evidence linking that to the mayor the city 
attorney said 
hahn noted however that a criminal investigation into the

boris n yeltsin the maverick soviet 
legislator on wednesday toured the birthplace of us democracy 
visiting independence hall and touching the liberty bell 
the same kind of crack which i see in this bell should not 
arise in the free countries of the world as a result of the 
emergence of liberty yeltsin said 
after sightseeing the 58yearold yeltsin addressed more than 
800 people at a world affairs council luncheon for a fee of 25000 
which he said will go to charity 
yeltsin who met briefly with president bush during his weeklong 
speaking tour of the united states also arranged for a meeting 
thursday with former president reagan recovering from brain surgery 
at a hospital in rochester minn reagan spokesman mark weinberg 
said 
yeltsin a sharp critic of what he called mikhail gorbachevs 
compromising and half measures said he hoped the soviet union 
would improve economic relations with the united states 
we have to change some of our laws on land holdings and 
property to make this possible he said through an interpreter 
if foreigners could purchase land they would make investments 
i would like to see someone build 1 million apartments and sell 
them because soviet citizens have money available and they would 
bring a good price if they were good 
yeltsin ousted as moscows communist party chief in 1987 but 
later overwhelmingly elected to parliament said he did not expect 
any retaliation for his frank criticism about developments in his 
country 
im no less straightforward about what i say back there as i 
say here yeltsin said im trying to practice the diplomacy of 
truth i think we should get away from the oldfashioned diplomacy 
of people trying to outwit each other 
if we can be truthful it will increase the level of confidence 
between countries and people 
he said he did not expect any kind of effort to oust gorbachev 
calling it extremely unlikely since i have been on the inside for 
2 years and i know it cant happen 
on the thousands of east germans fleeing through hungary to the 
west he said people should have the right to leave their country 
and go someplace else this is part of an international agreement 
yeltsin was asked about a report that the kgb the soviet secret 
police had offered the united states help in its drug war 
all i can say is that the kgb has its hands full dealing with 
drugs in the ussr he answered they have to take care of their 
own domestic problems before they start trying to help someone 
else

as 500000 even while it was losing money the ministrys former 
finance director testified wednesday 
were spending as if theres no crisis peter bailey said in 
a july 1984 memo to bakker and ptl executive vice president richard 
dortch 
bailey testified about his warnings in the us district court 
trial of bakker who is charged with 24 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly diverting nearly 4 million from the 
taxexempt ministry bakker left ptl in disgrace in march 1987 in a 
sex and money scandal 
the prosecution testimony followed stories earlier this week from 
bakkers lifetime partners people who gave meager savings for 
the promise of guaranteed lodging at his theme park but were turned 
away because rooms werent built with their donations 
the wife of a disabled coal miner told the jury tuesday that she 
thought her 1000 contribution to ptl guaranteed a cheap vacation 
for her 13 children but she said never was given a room 
contributions to ptl hit a fiveyear low in 1986 bailey wrote in 
an oct 6 memo dropping to 35 million that september 
bailey said he wouldnt write checks except for emergencies but 
the ptl board voted a 500000 bonus for jim bakker and 100000 for 
his wife tammy faye on nov 3 about four months before bakkers 
reign ended at ptl 
bailey said he frequently had to take money from lifetime partner 
accounts to pay bonuses to bakker and dortch as well as salary 
payroll and other expenses partners paid 1000 in return for the 
promise of lifetime lodging privileges at bakkers heritage usa 
retreat and theme park 
bailey said in the memo that numerous accounts were overdue by 90 
days and some vendors were not being paid at all 
among baileys warnings 
bailey said he wrote in a march 16 1984 memo that every day 
brings us into a deeper crisis and that more than 700000 was 
needed to meet the payroll less than two weeks later records 
showed that bakker received a 390000 bonus from the board 
in 1983 bailey said he warned bakker that he was dipping into 
ptls savings account to pay operating expenses and that bakker 
approved ten days earlier the board approved bonuses totaling 
150000 for the bakkers 
bailey said he told bakker in november 1983 that contributions 
for the month totaled 47 million and expenditures were 68 
million two weeks later prosecutor deborah smith said the board 
voted another 150000 bonus for the bakkers 
on sept 6 1985 bailey warned bakker the ministry was 
surviving on lifetime partner donations and said cuts of 40 percent 
were needed immediately in the ministry payroll on nov 12 1985 
the prosecution said bakker got a 250000 bonus from the board 
a tulsa okla attorney testified late wednesday afternoon that 
he too had expressed concerns about the partnership program 
charles chapel who was hired to represent ptl in march 1986 when 
the ministry was responding to an internal revenue service audit for 
198183 said he told ministry officials the lifetime partnerships 
should be separated from general contributions 
chapel was withdrawn from the ptl account in september 1986 he 
said dortch had told him the ministry wanted to hire another law 
firm to represent ptl in an upcoming irs audit for 198485 
after he was replaced chapel wrote bakker a letter saying you 
have got to get your church under control or it will be lost 
if convicted bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison 
and fined more than 5 million 
dortch pleaded guilty to similar charges and was sentenced to 
eight years in prison and fined 200000

the leader of the militant antiabortion group 
operation rescue and four associates were acquitted wednesday on 
trespassing charges for blocking entrances to clinics where they 
said abortions were performed 
the municipal court jurors who deliberated for four days 
indicated after delivering their verdicts that they had accepted 
randall terrys necessity defense in spite of the judges ruling 
to the contrary terry and his codefendants have claimed laws can be 
broken to prevent a greater harm 
we felt they stood up for their rights we didnt feel they 
broke the law said juror mike simons of west los angeles 
the jury found terry who represented himself at the trial and 
the other activists innocent of five misdemeanor charges that 
included trespassing resisting arrest and criminal conspiracy 
the jurors however deadlocked 84 for conviction on conspiracy 
counts against terry 30 of binghamton ny michael mcmonagle 
36 of philadelphia and jeff white 31 of santa cruz 
judge richard paez declared a mistrial on the three counts 
meaning they could be refiled by the city attorneys office 
prosecutors said a decision on refiling the charges would be made by 
oct 2 
paez had said earlier the issue at trial was not abortion but 
trespassing and ruled the necessity defense did not apply 
because abortion is legal defendants motives for their actions 
were not legitimate defenses in the case he said 
the judge had scolded terry and the other defendants for 
repeatedly drawing the jurys attention to their opposition to legal 
abortions 
the five were on trial for allegedly ignoring a federal 
injunction barring activists to block entrances to abortion clinics 
terry denied he was ever served a copy of the court order 
also on trial were don bennette 36 of mission viejo and andrew 
eppink 41 of palmdale 
juror edmond bleavins said he hoped the verdict would send a 
message to the los angeles police department the police just 
brutalized these people in my opinion he said 
bleavins said he did not intend to give operation rescue the 
message they could keep on doing what theyve been doing he 
said the jury deadlocked on conspiracy to block the entrance to 
clinics was because at least one juror felt the defendants intent 
was not to break the law but to save babies 
only one of the defendants white was present for the verdicts 
defendants are not required to be present for all phases of 
misdemeanor trials 
thank god i think its wonderful that a jury of our peers has 
said its not against the law to save babies in la white said 
he said the jury appeared to have accepted defense claims that 
the los angeles police department used excessive force and believed 
the issue of our intent we were there to save lives 
asked if the abortion issue came up during deliberations juror 
marilyn mcnichols of downey answered i wouldnt say it didnt 
come up but i would honestly say it was not a factor in arriving at 
our decision 
deputy city attorney lara bloomquist leaving the courthouse 
said the defendants had succeeded in turning the abortion issue into 
their defense 
she said the compression of television screens jurors viewed 
during the trial made the police tactics appear more violent than 
they were 
the charges were lodged after operation rescue activists blocked 
the doors to a womens clinic on march 25 during a week of protests 
in which more than 1000 antiabortion activists were arrested 
throughout california 
the protests were held as the us supreme court considered a 
missouri law later upheld which broadened the role of states in 
making laws about when a woman can have an abortion 
during the trial terry frequently referred to abortion clinics 
as aboratorium killing centers and abortion mills 
prompting paez to rebuke him for using inflammatory language

wheat farmers will be allowed to increase 
production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish its wheat 
reserves agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced wednesday 
the agriculture department will dip into its reserve for some 35 
million metric tons of wheat for this year and next to meet us 
commitments for international food aid a department statement said 
the change in the wheat program will cause a slight increase in 
the overall income of wheat farmers the statement said acreage of 
harvested wheat will increase from an estimated 675 million acres 
to 696 million acres because of the program change 
under the 1990 wheat program farmers are required to idle 5 
percent of their wheat acreage to qualify for federal supports 
farmers now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of the 
farms wheat base rising to a limit of 105 percent the statement 
said 
the action today does not suggest that we expect another year 
of less than average wheat yields nor will it boost stocks 
significantly yeutter said but it will help restore stocks to 
safer levels in view of the tight us and world supply and demand 
situation we should give wheat producers the option to increase 
plantings if they wish to do so 
this decision comes less than two months after yeutter said there 
would be no change in the 5 percent acreage reduction program for 
wheat

a grand jury on wednesday indicted a local man 
on charges of assault with dangerous weapons for allegedly having 
sex with a 13yearold boy at the same time he knew he had aids 
michael a feaster 30 was indicted on a total of 41 counts 
involving six children by a district of columbia superior court 
grand jury 
he surrendered to police wednesday night and is being held in the 
city jail on 200000 bond he will be arraigned thursday 
feasters attorney duff lewis said the us attorneys office 
was seeking to create a mass hysteria over the aids virus 
according to the indictment feaster abused the children between 
the ages of 9 and 15 from june 1987 until february of this year 
feaster was charged with three counts of assault with a dangerous 
weapon for incidents which allegedly occurred between november 1988 
and february 1989 after he tested positive for the hiv virus the 
indictment stated 
the indictment said feaster assaulted the boy with dangerous 
weapons by having sex with him at after having tested positive for 
aids 
georgetown university law professor robert stein said the charge 
was unusual 
it is unusual but there are a number of examples of people who 
have had sex with others knowing they were infected who under state 
laws have been brought to trial in a couple of cases including 
one in the military in a courtmartial they were convicted stein 
said 
the indictment caused concern among some close to aids victims 
if we have our law enforcement agencies in the country now 
beginning to define aids as a lethal weapon then all of our efforts 
at educating people and encouraging people to come forward and be 
tested and receive treatment as early as possible could seriously 
by hampered by something like this said robert harvey of the 
whitmanwalker clinic a major aids treatment facility in the 
washington area

the supreme court granted a defense request 
wednesday and postponed an appeal by a convicted nazi war criminal 
enabling his attorney to verify new evidence he claims was covered 
up by the united states 
the decision on john demjanjuks appeal followed a 4hour 
session in which prosecutor michael shaked disputed that the 
americans had hidden any evidence in the case 
the appeal before the fivejustice panel was postponed from nov 
1 to may 14 1990 
demjanjuk 69 a retired auto worker from the cleveland suburb of 
seven hills was found guilty by an israeli court in april 1988 of 
crimes against humanity and crimes against the jewish people he was 
sentenced to death 
demjanjuk was convicted of being a nazi guard known as ivan the 
terrible who switched on the gas chambers in 19421943 at the 
treblinka death camp where 850000 jews perished 
but the ukrainianborn demjanjuk claims to be a victim of 
mistaken identity and testified at his trial that he was at two 
other nazi prisoner of war camps during that period 
demjanjuk attorney yoram sheftel told the court he had recently 
received new evidence that could help his client 
these included documents found several weeks ago in a garbage bin 
across the street from the justice departments office of special 
investigations osi in washington sheftel said the office 
investigates alleged nazi war criminals 
of course we are delighted we have at least until may said 
ed nishnic demjanjuks soninlaw and leader of the clevelandbased 
john demjanjuk defense fund well have the evidence needed to 
present to the supreme court we hope to have further evidence we 
have identified that is still in the possession of the osi 
sheftel said the papers were found after news from an inside 
leaker at the justice department he declined to elaborate on his 
alleged informant 
one document is a memorandum of an interview with a former nazi 
prison guard otto horn who failed to identify demjanjuk in a photo 
lineup contradicting evidence presented in court sheftel said 
the other memorandum he said concerned a treblinka survivor 
named rigrodsky allegedly questioned before a 1981 trial to strip 
demjanjuk of us citizenship 
sheftel said rigrodsky had recounted being forced to play the 
violin for officers at the camp including demjanjuk during a 
period when demjanjuk was said by other witnesses to have been 
assigned to another camp 
the accused is in effect shown in two places at the same time 
but the court verdict never referred to this contradiction 
sheftel said 
sheftel said he had heard there were also other documents 
withheld from demjanjuk lawyers he said he filed a motion tuesday 
with the us district court in washington to obtain this and other 
evidence from five important witnesses within 30 days 
the lawyer said the justice department office has been hiding 
concealing and fabricating evidence he argued that he needed at 
least another six months to pursue the paperwork 
prosecutor shaked accused sheftel of using delay tactics he said 
the court record showed the us officials had answered numerous 
defense requests for information and called the documents that 
sheftel referred to working papers which have no power of 
evidence 
the justice department has consistently refused to comment on the 
allegations saying only that demjanjuks 1986 deportation was 
upheld by us courts 
after consulting more than an hour the five judges postponed a 
ruling on the admissibility of the new evidence but agreed to delay 
the appeals date until may

police stormed an outlying slum and 
captured the citys top drug kingpin wednesday he is believed to 
have direct ties to colombias medellin drug cartel an official 
said 
darcy da silva filho allegedly smuggled large amounts of cocaine 
from the medellin cartel to brazil as well as neighboring bolivia 
state police col emir campos laranjeira said 
filho had direct contacts with drug bosses in medellin and 
bolivia laranjeira said he went there personally on several 
occasions to buy he smuggled cocaine in shipments as large as 800 
pounds 
he said filho 37 sold an average of 130 pounds of cocaine in 
rio each week that represents about 60 percent of the citys drug 
trafficking operations he said 
this is perhaps the biggest drug arrest in rio in recent 
times said laranjeira the repercussions of this arrest will be 
far felt 
early wednesday 120 policemen with machine guns shotguns and 
aided by helicopters began the daylong raid they discovered the 
drug traffickers in a lavishly furnished apartment at noon 
laranjeira said 
after an intense gunbattle filhos bodyguards fled and police 
arrested the drug baron his chauffeur and nephew said laranjeira 
police seized 13 pounds of cocaine paste valued at 200000 but 
found no weapons he said 
the drug leader has been charged on three counts of drug 
trafficking and faces up to 40 years in prison laranjeira said 
brazil traditionally has played a relatively minor role in the 
south american drug trade which is dominated by colombia peru and 
bolivia colombias medellin and cali cocaine cartels produce an 
estimated 80 percent of cocaine for us markets 
but in recent years south americas largest nation has emerged 
as a key player in international trafficking with a role in every 
stage of the drug chain from production to consumption 
seizures of cocaine have risen from about 200 pounds in 1981 to 
more than 15 times that amount last year according to police 
figures

us officials said wednesday they have 
trustworthy reports that burmas military government routinely 
tortures political prisoners and it has become questionable whether 
the countrys election next spring will be free 
electric shocks cigarette burnings beatings and other forms of 
torture were described at the state departments daily news 
briefing and later by department witnesses who told a congressional 
hearing that the burmese junta has killed and arrested thousands in 
a continuing wave of repression that began one year ago 
congress also heard testimony about forced labor and death 
marches in burma in which members of ethnic minorities were 
rounded up put on starvation rations and used as human minesweepers 
for army units 
two house foreign affairs subcommittees unanimously approved a 
resolution demanding that burma release everyone imprisoned for 
the peaceful expression of their views investigate and punish 
those accused of torture and uphold its commitment to free and fair 
elections by next may 
the legislation also urged all countries to follow the us lead 
in withholding foreign aid from burma it was sent to the full 
committee and sponsors said a final floor vote would be sought this 
month the senate last month passed a similar resolution with 
backing of the bush administration 
from burma we now have credible firsthand reports that 
instances of torture beatings and mistreatment are commonplace and 
that deaths have resulted state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler told reporters 
she and richard schifter assistant secretary of state for human 
rights who testified in congress made similar statements 
describing cigarette burnings beatings causing severe eye and ear 
injuries electrical shocks to the genitals and immersion in water 
during questioning 
such mistreatment along with forced loss of sleep appear to be 
routine methods of questioning of thousands of detainees in burma 
schifter told a joint hearing of the subcommittees on human rights 
and asian and pacific affairs 
the number of burmese killed by the government the past year is 
in the thousands he said it may well be that the number of 
burmese killed is indeed higher than the count of those massacred 
in chinas current crackdown on its democracy movement he said in 
answer to a question 
burmas military government headed by general saw maung seized 
power sept 18 1988 ousting a monthold moderate civilian regime 
that took over after the resignation of general ne win whose 
18yearrule schifter said had reduced burma to a state of 
poverty 
recent developments in burma call into question the military 
governments pledge that it will hold free and fair elections and 
turn over power to a civilian government said david f 
lambertson deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs 
recent measures appear designed to engineer an electoral 
victory by the leading progovernment party he said thousands of 
backers of the national league for democracy and other leading 
opposition groups have been arrested since july 20 and nld leaders 
aung san suu kyi and tin oo are under house arrest virtually cut 
off from the rest of the world lambertson testified 
schifter said the united states has not given up hope for a fair 
election but the situation is going to have to change leaders of 
the opposition are going to have to be given freedom recent 
performance does not give much reason for optimism 
the government might well step up its resort to lethal force if 
political opponents mounted mass public protests anew he said

an appeals court wednesday cleared the way 
for a citizens group to put a referendum on state ballots calling 
for a 20 percent cut in auto insurance rates 
in a 21 decision an appellate division panel of superior court 
ruled that the referendum sponsored by citizens auto revolt is 
legal representatives of the insurance industry said they would 
appeal to the state supreme court 
the nonbinding referendum is to be placed on the november ballot 
in each of new jerseys 21 counties it urges state lawmakers to 
trim auto insurance rates by 20 percent and enact several reforms of 
the state insurance system 
lawyers for the insurance industry had argued that the 
referendums sponors acted improperly by trying to place the 
initiative on each countys ballot rather than on a statewide basis 
but two of three judges on the panel agreed with the groups 
contention that it could initiate a statewide referendum through the 
counties 
this is a very exciting and important decision said jay 
angoff executive director of the reform group it shows that a 
citizens group can fight back against an industry as powerful as the 
insurance industry by going directly to the people 
michael herbert an attorney representing the insurance industry 
said the referendum would confuse voters and create turmoil 
in addition to the rollback in auto insurance costs the 
referendum urges state lawmakers to initiate reforms that include 
the scrapping of the joint underwriting association pool for high 
risk drivers and the elimination of the insurance industrys 
exemption to the antitrust laws governing pricefixing

almost every day in el 
salvadors guerrilla war khakiclad commandos of an unsung assault 
force have descended on war zones armed only with ratchets pulleys 
and shovels 
they are the intrepid electricpower linemen who replace towers 
toppled by guerrilla sabotage raise tons of downed cable and keep 
the countrys lights on in the midst of civil war 
they have seen companions killed and maimed by mines or in cross 
fires and now they are delighted with the announcement by the 
antigovernment guerrillas of an indefinite end to sabotage as of 
sept 10 
the linemen however have plenty to keep them busy for months 
without new damage to the network of hightension cables 
crisscrossing el salvador a nation about the size of massachusetts 
halting the sabotage is good because everybody is favored by 
it said lineman roberto segovia but lets see what the 
government offers in exchange to show it is really interested in 
peace and ending the war for good 
he was one of 30 linemen working to replace six poles bombed 
recently along a major transmission line traversing a high flank of 
the volcano looming northwest of san salvador the capital city 
segovia was wounded in the face by shrapnel in 1986 when a 
soldier near him stepped on a mine at a sabotaged site 
although mines have killed one lineman and wounded seven since 
1981 the linemen dont speak harshly of the marxistled guerrillas 
who have been fighting the government for nearly a decade 
antonio ramirez a lineman whose left arm was partly disabled by 
shrapnel in 1981 said guerrillas sometimes visit the workers at job 
sites and the meetings are cordial 
describing an encounter late last year he said we talked 
about things in general then all gave each other christmas embraces 
before they went off 
almost all of the linemen are members of a militant union 
veterans of labor battles that have given their views a tone similar 
to that of many positions expressed by the farabundo marti national 
liberation front the guerrilla organization 
the front said in its announcement sept 7 that its suspension of 
sabotage and the use of mines was for a sufficiently prudent time 
for the government and armed forces to carry out reciprocal gestures 
that contribute to a serious climate of negotiation 
the governments immediate response was that the suspension would 
permit the guerrillas to evacuate their wounded 
a subsequent broadcast on the guerrillas clandestine radio said 
sabotage has played a strategic role in the war preventing the 
regime from spending all its money on arms sabotage has undermined 
the war economy and its effectiveness has been undeniable 
sabotage of the electricpower system has cost the country more 
than 100 million since the war began and it has been getting 
steadily worse last year was the worst to date with 539 bombings of 
major lines through august of this year 451 bombings of such lines 
were recorded a rate that would easily have surpassed 1988 had 
sabotage continued 
however the united states through the agency for international 
development aid pays virtually all the repairs to damaged power 
lines it has provided more than 35 billion in military and 
economic aid this decade in an effort to prevent a rebel victory 
making el salvador by far the hemispheres biggest recipient of us 
assistance 
without aid we couldnt survive said mauricio arevalo 
superintendent of line maintainance who oversees the 90 linemen 
five engineers and five foremen who keep the power flowing 
nationwide 
aid provided the two bell 212 helicopters that transport the 
workers and carry dangling from a cable the 40foot pine poles 
also donated by aid that hold the lines 
the steel towers used originally now lie twisted and rusting 
along transmission routes 
between 75 and 80 percent of our metal structures have been 
destroyed said arevalo on the volcano with his men we replace 
them with poles because its much cheaper and they are much more 
mobile 
a lineman with 20 years experience earns the equivalent of about 
280 a month including the 35percent raise that was the result of 
a bitter 21day strike last year plus 7000 life insurance 
policies el salvadors minimum wage is 100 a month but 280 a 
month is about what a teacher or factory worker would earn the 
linemen maintain that their wages and compensation are inadequate 
raul mendez who lost his right leg below the knee to a mine in 
1986 said he received 3500 in compensation and continues working 
with a prosthesis 
asked if he resented the guerrillas who planted the mine he 
said not at all its the kind of thing that happens in this line 
of work

could it be just a coincidence that 99 percent 
of the quarterbacks 98 percent of the kickers and 97 percent of the 
centers in professional football in 1983 were whites while 82 
percent of kickoff returners 88 percent of running backs and 92 
percent of cornerbacks were blacks 
it couldnt be and it isnt says sociologist d stanley eitzen 
who has taken on and ripped to shreds the proposition that the 
world of sports is at least one place in america thats free of 
racial discrimination 
club owners coaches players and fans are united in the desire 
to win and so the color of the players doesnt matter as long as 
they perform right 
wrong says this scholar and tragically wrong for millions of 
black youngsters who put all their energies into preparing for a 
career as an athlete and wind up unable to play and unable to do 
anything else well enough to earn a living at it 
eitzen is a professor of sociology at colorado state university 
and a former president of the north american society for the 
sociology of sport when the national academy of sciences asked 
scholars and experts to write a report on the status of blacks in 
american society today they farmed out the research to other 
scholars and experts eitzen wrote the paper on black athletes 
the academys final report a common destiny blacks and 
american society came out this summer its overall conclusion was 
that whatever progress was made in improving the status of blacks 
occurred before the early 1970s since then the status of blacks 
relative to whites has stagnated or regressed 
the report paid little attention to eitzens research on racism 
in sports but the academy made a copy available to the associated 
press 
eitzen is no more cheerful about the status of blacks in sports 
than the committee was about blacks in society overall even though 
four out of five basketball players half the football players and a 
fifth of the baseball players in the big leagues are black 
rather than being free from racism sport as a microcosm of the 
larger society reflects the same racial problems he says 
applying sociologys use of statistics to sports he concludes 
if you are a black player youve got to be considerably better 
than a competing white to be signed to a professional contract 
if youre black expect to play the lessprestige positions the 
ones that require brawn not brains 
since those positions are the ones in which youll take more of 
a physical punishment your playing career will be shorter and your 
career earnings from sports less than if you were white 
if youre the black parents of a talented athlete think again 
if you believe that sports is your sons entree to the good life 
sports as a mobility escalator as an escape hatch is a 
dead end for almost all he says 
the majority would be better off stretching their minds than 
their muscles america doesnt have jobs for washedout potential 
athletes who know nothing but sports 
many boys work very hard to become great in sport but only a 
very few will be successful eitzen said they spend many hours 
per day developing their speed strength and moves to the virtual 
exclusion of those abilities that have a greater likelihood of 
paying off in upward mobility mathematical reasoning and 
communication skills 
on the playing fields and courts central positions calling for 
leadership and control go to white players the research said 
citing the statistics on football positions 
it is inconceivable that blacks lack the ability to play these 
positions at the professional level eitzen said 
placekick holders must for example have good hands an 
important quality for pass receivers 
but a 1973 study of all players whose names appeared in the 
football register found that twothirds of professional pass 
receivers were black while all the placekick holders were whites 
to show that black players must be better than white players to 
succeed in the sports world eitzen cites research which compared 
big league batting averages it shows that blacks batted on 
average 20 points better than their white counterparts he 
concludes that blacks who play only as good as whites wont be 
offered contracts 
how else he asks explain statistics like these big league 
black pitchers in 1967 won an average of 102 games white pitchers 
that year won 75 each on average in basketball blacks career 
scoring averages were 111 points per game compared to 93 for 
whites 
where is the black who scores only 93 points per game less 
likely to play than a white with that score and eitzen says thats 
proof of racism

he was the most brilliant defense attorney in 
the state of indiana and it was the most important case of his 
career yet lloyd bridges plays him as a man who was happy to lose 
it was 1925 and eph inmans client was david curtis stephenson

eph inman was considered the best lawyer in indiana bridges 
said and stephenson wanted the best for his defense eph was 
shrewd and folksy we see that he was very clever but he didnt 
have much to work with stephenson didnt have much character 
i think in the end he was glad he didnt succeed in getting him 
off he lost very few cases it was the most important case of its 
time and if he had won it would have been another feather in his 
cap 
the case destroyed the klan in indiana stephenson angered that 
gov ed jackson wouldnt pardon him released his little black 
box its contents sent a congressman the mayor of indianapolis 
the sheriff of marion county and numerous other officials to prison

a person delivering a pizza falls on your 
slippery front step 
or an unfriendly neighbor sues you for slander after an argument 
or the guests at a recent party claim the food you served made 
them sick 
these are but a sampling of the everyday risks people run in a 
society where going to court often seems far from the last resort 
in this lawsuitcrazy age you can be ordered to pay damages for 
any number of reasons including personal injury character 
defamation even mental anguish says jonathan pond of financial 
planning information inc in watertown mass 
standard home and car insurance policies may provide you with 
considerable protection from this peril but what if a court award 
exceeds the limits of your liability coverage 
then your assets your home and savings even a portion of your 
future earnings could be at risk 
to protect yourself against such an eventuality pond and other 
students of the subject suggest looking into extended personal 
liability insurance popularly known as an umbrella policy 
an umbrella policy ideally serves two purposes says william 
brennan at the accounting firm of ernst amp young 
first it increases the primary liability coverage limits on 
basic policies such as automobile and homeowners second umbrella 
insurance broadens the primary coverage by insuring against claims 
that may be excluded in the primary policies 
enough a beleagured consumer may protest at about this point 
if i buy every kind of insurance they want to sell me i wont have 
anything left to lose besides its a fools errand to try to 
insulate yourself from every risk in life 
perhaps so but in this case brennan says a little money in 
premiums paid on umbrella insurance goes a long way 
the first 1 million in umbrella protection typically costs 
between 100 and 200 a year for 1 million increments above that 
the premiums are even smaller 
because umbrella insurance offers enormous coverage for a small 
premium the added coverage should be viewed as a necessity and a 
wise investment brennan contends 
before you decide on any given umbrella advisers say you should 
examine it for leaks 
normally says pond all liability costs not related to 
your occupation are covered including legal defense costs however 
exclusions on individual policies will vary therefore it is 
important to understand all policy provisions 
that phrase not related to your occupation is one important 
exception umbrellas generally dont cover problems that can arise 
in the line of duty whether the case involves medical malpractice 
or copyright infringement by a writer or artist 
in these cases professional liability insurance is recommended 
also there can be significant gaps between the upper limits of 
your primary policies and the initial coverage limits of an umbrella 
policy brennan notes 
you and your insurance agent should work together to minimize 
or eliminate any gaps 
since the primary and umbrella coverage needs to be matched 
together pond adds it is usual practice to seek umbrella insurance 
from the same source as your auto or homeowners coverage 
it is like a major medical policy that takes over where your 
basic policy ends he says

a solution has been found to one of the most 
distressing events in the life of smallbusiness founders and 
operators one that allows them to have their company and financial 
security too 
it turns what could have been a sad event into a triumph one 
that in many instances produces a winwinwin situation involving a 
relieved seller a happy buyer and satisfied lenders 
the event develops when a founder must sell out to raise funds 
perhaps to finance eventual retirement traditionally more than 
only a business is sold in the package also are skills hopes and 
sweat that built it 
even more the company a monument to the founder and 12hour 
days may be bought by a larger company that puts a less dedicated 
9to5 manager in charge sales fade in a few years the company 
disappears 
no monument no tombstone not even a memory 
sanford ziff escaped that fate which was common a few years ago 
he got full price for his 100unit retail chain put money in the 
bank remained in control provided for his sons participation 
received funds to expand and obtained an investment in a 
firstclass rationally structured company 
that or other seemingly impossible feats is the combined result 
of more creative lending itself a consequence of bank deregulation 
more enterprising investment groups and ingenious 
boutiqueinvestment advisers 
alan k wells who helped put the ziff deal together is one 
acting for the seller his firm bollinger wells lett amp co brings 
the parties together determines the needs of each and somehow 
merges the different interests 
its a touchy timeconsuming business involving intimate 
knowledge of the sellers needs the interests of potential buyers 
and the possibilities for creative financing it involves no 
boilerplate each deal is unique 
overly simplified a price perhaps 20 million is set by wells 
and the seller wells already has a list of investment groups that 
might consider the deal one is acceptable with wells the parties 
sit down to discussions 
you never know the shape of the table in advance says wells 
he and his client at one moment might be confronting the buyer but 
shortly thereafter joining the buyer as an investor in the new 
capitalized company 
the buyer and its investors often including wells his client 
and maybe some of the clients family seek financing generally 
they put up a relatively small amount borrowing the rest 
that small investment however can capture sizeable ownership 
the reason because the recapitalization involves large amounts of 
debt the equity value of the company shrinks perhaps from 20 
million to 1 million 
therefore to buy 10 percent of the financially restructured 
company costs only 100000 which generally makes the 
entrepreneurseller happy 
it should the entrepreneur gets liquidity estate planning and 
assured survival of his heritage he or she keeps ongoing control of 
the future without great personal risk because much of the risk has 
been transferred to lenders 
and wells insists freed from worries protected from lenders 
by covenants the entrepreneur becomes a better manager able to 
concentrate on expanding the market which he knows rather than 
tedious backoffice details 
others are happy too says wells lender and buyer get good 
management and participation in a company with cash flow to handle 
repayments and growth to retire debt lenders get a good return and 
maybe the chance to convert debt to equity as the company grows 
wells says the process beats the way deals were done just five 
years ago then he says small companies simply were bought out by 
large companies in two years the manager was gone five years 
later the company was gone 
now he says the manager and his family have liquidity key 
employees have stock control is retained and recapitalized the 
company leaps the divide that keeps small companies from growing 
large

the people that were there that i have seen and talked to since 
couldnt just get over the beauty of the whole thing i had several 
say that it was so beautiful that they almost clapped for approval 
they just thought it added a lot to the funeral 
the tribute video is the brainchild of merrill womach 
founder and president of national music service a spokane company 
that has been providing recorded music and sound systems to funeral 
homes and mausoleums since 1958 
i first thought about it when john f kennedy was assassinated 
i looked at all the things that were done for him and rightfully 
so womach said 
and i thought to myself why cant a tribute be paid to us 
normal peons rather than just reserved for heads of state do not 
our families love us as much as jfk was loved i think everbody 
whos lived deserves a memorialization or a tribute paid to their 
life no matter whether they were a president or a king or a brick 
layer or a garbage collector 
the idea got sidetracked until womachs mother died 3 years ago 
he remembered seeing her in a nursing home in her last three months 
haggard and weakened from several strokes every time he thought of 
his mother it was this somber scene then last year he gathered 
some old family album pictures of her cheerful spirited and 
smiling the pictures were reproduced onto videotape 
now when i think of my mother you know what comes to my mind 
instantly its that picture on the video 
several thousand tribute videos have been sold in 17 states 
most through funeral homes since they were introduced in april the 
videos which can be played on a standard vhs recorder cost an 
average 100125 the music comes from national musics 2500title 
library and is recorded with the companys proprietary process 
acquaintances of actress amanda blake miss kitty in the tv 
series gunsmoke bought a tribute video that was played on 
a huge tv monitor at her aug 24 memorial service in sacramento 
calif 
what were trying to do is to celebrate the life of the 
individual we resurrect a memory said womach who almost died in 
a thanksgiving 1961 plane crash and has had a tribute produced 
of himself 
partly because of the soaring demand for its videos national 
music plans to double its staff of 100 next year 
its a very meaningful way to express a persons life and how 
he lived it said larry rayburn a funeral director at riplinger 
funeral home where tribute tapes have been played at about 15 
funerals including browns 
i personally think funeral services are something people do not 
like to go to rayburn said this is a way to notice that a 
death has occurred but also to celebrate a persons life 
in warren mich the family of a 5yearold girl killed in a car 
accident ordered a tribute video after her funeral don 
temrowski director of ds temrowski funeral home said the death 
was especially traumatic because the girl died in her stepfathers 
arms and her body was grossly disfigured 
after viewing the videotape the girls mother remarked my 
baby will live on continually temrowski said 
cathy robertson of sandpoint idaho who works in a funeral home 
ordered a video of her parents who died within three months of each 
other 
it has been five years since they passed away and its almost 
like having them back for those few minutes she wrote to womach 
i have watched my 11yearold daughter watch it over and over 
what a beautiful and lasting remembrance to pass on to the 
grandchildren especially the younger one when the memories are 
starting to fade yes we have picture albums but there is something 
very different about the video

tim robbins the lanky costar of 
bull durham and miss firecracker is trying his hand as a 
playwright and director of a play that takes a biting look at 
religious con artists and other media manipulators 
cowritten with adam simon carnage an unruly satire on 
religious evangelism was one of two american entries in this years 
edinburgh international festival robbins directs but does not 
appear in the play which opens offbroadway sept 17 at the public 
theater for a monthlong run 
its kind of like our boston our new haven robbins said 
with a laugh in the wee hours one recent morning at the st brides 
center in edinburgh where carnage recently finished seven 
performances 
carnage marks the new york debut of the actors gang a 
14member ensemble from los angeles most of whom were classmates at 
the university of california at los angeles robbins alma mater 
although the gang has been mounting knockabout productions of such 
classic plays as ubu roi since 1981 they lately have opted for 
original scripts with a satiric and political bent 
carnage takes aim at fundamentalism in the united states 
mocking such evangelists as jimmy swaggart and jim and tammy faye 
bakker as well as a public that can heroworship col oliver north 
although none of these people is mentioned by name they are all 
implicated in the plays absurdist brew 
the play opened to fine reviews in los angeles last year 
following a 1987 workshop but critics in edinburgh were divided 
martin hoyle in the financial times praised the cartoonstrip 
robustness of robbins direction adding that it made a welcome 
change from so much prissiness on the english stage but charles 
osborne in the daily telegraph said that its savagery is toothless 
and the finale collapses into bathos 
robbins admitted that the production was still being finetuned 
but said he expected conflicting reactions 
we try to produce plays that raise questions rather than 
provide answers the boyish 30yearold said between puffs of a 
cigarette after a latenight performance 
i personally do not care for theater that is just purely 
entertaining i like to be challenged i think thats more important 
than having a play that everyone smiles at enjoys thoroughly and 
forgets the second they leave the theater 
he said he and simon a 27yearold graduate of harvard 
university wrote carnage to confront rapturism and the 
dangers of that which no one in the press was talking about 
of wayward evangelists robbins said i think its 
irresponsible to just write it off as these people being corrupt 
financially or sexually when theyre indeed more corrupt in a much 
more insidious way 
for some reason people within the media in the united states 
are afraid of born again christians as if they have some kind of 
majority as if the moral majority really was a majority he said 
robbins thinks he may get a rough ride from the new york critics 
because he thinks they are biased against los angeles drama and 
because political drama in america is really not encouraged you 
try to say something and unless you hit it spot on people tear you 
apart 
he has kept the actors gang afloat with proceeds from his 
supporting roles in movies such as howard the duck and the 
sure thing but that is more difficult now that he has a 
4monthold son by susan sarandon his bull durham costar 
in bull durham the hit baseball movie of 1988 he played a 
klutzy pitcher opposite kevin costner in miss firecracker he 
was the deranged philosophizing cousin of holly hunter he will 
next be seen this fall in the title role of erik the viking a 
comedy directed by terry jones formerly of the monty python comedy 
troupe 
costarring john cleese and mickey rooney and filmed in britain 
last winter erik is a very sweet story robbins said

the white men called it next year country 
next year the rains will come the prairie fires or locust or 
hoppers or blizzards wont next year the price of wheat will be 
up taxes down next year the bankll be paid off the truckll be 
paid up the cowsll pay for themselves 
thats the american west next year country 
except this year 
this year north dakota south dakota montana and washington are 
celebrating their 100th birthdays and theyre having a riproarin 
party stetching most of the way from the missouri river to the 
pacific ocean 
wyoming and idaho have caught the spirit too because next year 
marks their centennials if you missed the huge barbecues cattle 
drives rodeos fairs powwows fishing tournaments parades 
dances and the 101 other festivities this year idaho and wyoming 
promise encores in 90 
president bush who earlier took part in north dakotas 
centennial observance heads to sioux falls sd and helena 
mont on monday to join in festivities then on to spokane wash 
on tuesday 
centennial celebrations are milestones measured long ago in much 
of the rest of the nation virginians floridians even missourians 
may wonder why all the fuss 
well the west has always been americas young upstart the 
shirttail relative of the establishment east the antebellum south 
the spanish southwest the conservative agrarian midwest 
but in the 1980s the west has come of age and come into its own 
it has a cachet sought by ceos as well as collegians everywhere you 
look from hollywoods movies to detroits cars mustang cherokee 
dakota bronco to ralph laurens and calvin kleins designer denim 
fashion the west is in 
ask bill cody the 76yearold grandson of buffalo bill when i 
was born granddad was one of the most famous men in the world 
said cody a lookalike for the old showman even today i go to 
singapore greece europe hell even sri lanka and the locals 
know about the west because of buffalo bill 
although thomas jefferson never saw the west the third president 
heard the siren singing in the lonely wind there and he had a 
vision he traveled only as far as harpers ferry wva but 
imagined the fledgling united states stretching from the potomac to 
the columbia river south to the mouth of the mississippi and north 
to the headwaters of the missouri 
all eyes all hopes are now fixed on you jefferson wrote in 
january 1803 to james monroe urging him to be his special envoy to 
france and negotiate the louisiana purchase on the event of this 
mission depends the future destinies of this republic 
monroe pulled it off for 15 million the united states acquired 
the entire 830000squaremile territory claimed by france in the 
new world 
pulitzer prizewinning historian bernard de voto described it as 
one of the most important events in history 
not only did it double the area of the united states not only 
did it add to our wealth resources of incalculable value not only 
did it provide a potential that was certain to make us a great 
power not only did it make equally certain that we would expand 
beyond the rockies to the pacific it also provided the 
centripetal unifying force that would hold the nation firm against 
disruptive forces from within wrote de voto 
even before his diplomats had sealed the deal jefferson had 
secretly asked congress for 2500 to cover the cost of dispatching 
an expedition up the missouri river and on to the pacific for the 
purpose of extending the external commerce of the united states 
the reason was a red herring innocuous so as not to alarm the 
british or spanish who still held enormous tracts in north america 
but it was excuse enough for army capts meriwether lewis and 
william clark cocommanders to leap at the opportunity to chart a 
map marked unknown 
lewis who grew up on a farm called locust hill only 10 miles by 
straight gallop northwest of jeffersons virginia estate monticello 
called the chance to explore the west a darling project of my 
heart 
young albert gallatin an immigrant from switzerland who had a 
good head for numbers was jeffersons treasury secretary and 
therefore responsible for paying the ventures bills lewis and 
clark remembered by christening a river after him 
today the gallatin name is attached to many western landmarks 
including a montana county and the bozeman airport gallatins 
oldest living descendant beatrice gallatin beuf 82 lives just 
over the montana border in big horn wyo 
when my father bought this ranch in 1911 we traveled by train 
from new york to sheridan and there were hitching posts on main 
street and nothing was paved she recalled we were met at the 
station by a wagon pulled by four horses their tails tied up in mud 
knots it took us four hours to travel 13 miles 
mrs beufs ranch reaches into the big horn mountains where she 
still rides her arabian mare every fair day it was she who was 
asked to sit next to queen elizabeth ii when the monarch dined in 
big horn on a 1984 private visit and regale her with stories 
this is a place where the glamorous days of the cowboy are just 
over your shoulder said mrs beuf youre not choked in with 
people troubles here your troubles are big ones drought too much 
snow a wind that can carry you away here we live with the great 
realities of life 
after lewis and clark came the mountain men the traders 
followed paddling up the missouri and the yellowstone rivers as 
the buffalo massacres decimated the herds cattlemen from as far 
away as the rio grande and even the clyde in scotland saw the 
potential and shrewdly staked out giant ranches 
when gold was discovered miners stampeded for dakota territory 
by the thousands enterprising merchants hot on their heels 
finally with the 1862 homestead act promising 160 acres to anyone 
with a strong back and the means to claim the land sodbusters

his father was a commercial fisherman 
so was his fathers father it follows then that randy babich was 
expected to become a dentist 
every fisherman tried to coax his son into something other than 
fishing they thought a steady job on land with a steady paycheck 
was less risky babich said the other day sitting on the family 
dock and thinking how lucky he was to have rejected that advice 
like his forebears randy babich has chosen the sea in doing so 
he helps to preserve a maritime heritage that has distinguished 
washingtons development since the first white settlers arrived 
sea traders plied the coast starting in the 1700s looking for 
furs even after the railroad arrived in 1883 most settlers who 
rode the rails westward passed up washingtons arid eastern plains 
preferring tidewater towns such as seattle and tacoma 
unlike much of the pacific coast where great ocean swells 
pounded the shore washingtons islandstudded puget sound offered 
miles of protected coastline salmon and other fish were abundant 
and the waterways became highways for ships hauling timber cut from 
tall forests 
randys grandfather spiro babich came from yugoslavia in 1910 
about 40 years after the first whites settled in gig harbor two of 
the towns founders were yugoslav fishermen and they started a 
slavic connection still obvious in the local phone book where 
jerisich markovich and stanich are well represented 
spiro babich was a typical immigrant he had no money and spoke 
no english but he learned fast he soon had his own boat and used 
it to zealously pursue salmon its said he used to pray for bad 
weather so the timid would go ashore and leave more fish for him 
when he died at 67 he was planning to fish the next summer 
one of his two boats went to son peter who fished until retiring 
last year at 65 talk about a duck out of water randy babich 
said of his father hes going to be leasing a boat for the fall 
just so he can go out and fish once a week 
randy 39 with a bachelors degree from the university of 
washington could have avoided the dangerous fishermans life but 
his exposure to the workaday world of landlubbers gave him an 
appreciation of fishing that his grandfathers generation couldnt 
match 
if they knew about commuting to work every day on the freeway 
fighting traffic theyd have come home and kissed their deck 
winch said babich 
fishing today is easier in many ways while his grandfather 
pulled up heavy tarredcotton nets by hand randy babich uses a 
power winch to haul nylon nets aboard the paragon his 56foot 
seiner 
but hazards remain the weather is as unpredictable as ever and 
babich like most washington fishermen now must motor up to the 
distant waters of alaska to make a living he complains about strict 
regulations foreign competition and outrageous insurance rates 
lately his son stefan 19 has been helping on the boat but 
just to work his way through school you understand 
i encourage him not to follow fishing babich said

a halfcentury ago as adolf hitlers war 
machine was crushing polish resistance to the west josef stalin 
sent the red army to wrest this city of forested hills and medieval 
churches from eastern poland 
for lvovs ukrainian population the outbreak of world war ii in 
september 1939 was the beginning of a bloody new series of battles 
across their land 
it ended just as the feuding of russians germans swedes 
poles lithuanians and ukrainians in this area had ended for 
centuries with lvov being incorporated into a new country 
now a stubborn streak of nationalism has reappeared denouncing 
both polish and soviet rule as occupation and seeking to encompass 
all of the soviet unions secondmost populous republic in what 
nationalists dream will one day be an independent ukraine 
to make that point a small group of organizers planned an 
openair religious service march and rally for sunday to mark the 
day soviet troops marched into poland they expected 100000 people 
to take part 
this will be a day of mourning said ivan gel the head of 
the lay council of an underground ukrainian church loyal to the 
vatican but outlawed since the areas incorporation into the soviet 
union 
soviet control began sept 17 1939 two and a half weeks after 
hitler started world war ii by attacking poland and less than a 
month after he and stalin reached a nonaggression agreement with a 
secret protocol dividing eastern europe into spheres of influence 
the red army moved into poland along a broad front encompassing 
what is now the western portions of the ukraine and byelorussia 
republics of the soviet union 
this was aggression and a second occupation after the 
occupation by poland said bogdan gorin a leader of the ukrainian 
helsinki group which was formed to monitor human rights in the 
republic of 52 million people 
before world war i lvov as well as poland itself was part of 
the russian empire after the 1917 bolshevik revolution polish and 
soviet armies fought back and forth between warsaw and kiev before a 
peace finally gave the western ukraine to poland 
the soviet union retained the rest of the ukraine which suffered 
severely through collectivization and famine during the 1930s 
oleg vitovich a 23yearold factory worker and helsinki group 
member said that in the context of the nazi attack on western 
poland lvov residents were friendly to the soviet soldiers when 
they arrived in 1939 
but almost two years of deportations and executions followed 
until the nazis invaded and seized the territory it stayed under 
german control for three years 
despite the cruelty of the nazis the attitude toward the soviet 
soldiers had changed vitovich said by 1944 when the red army 
came through here on its way to berlin the people didnt meet them 
with flowers but with guns in their hands with bullets he said 
armed bands of ukrainians held out against soviet power in the 
hills of the western ukraine for almost a decade after the war ended 
in 1945 
resistance to soviet domination has resurfaced much as it has in 
the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia to the north 
and in moldavia to the south 
lvov activists joined enthusiastically with more than 1000 other 
ukrainians in the republics capital of kiev on sept 810 to found 
the narodny ruk a grassroots political movement the movement takes 
in environmentalists a ukrainian language society and the local 
affiliate of a national organization dedicated to the memory of the 
victims of stalins terror 
even though the movement still is in its infancy the prospect of 
growing ukrainian demands for independence is a troubling one for 
the soviet union 
it is one thing when the baltic republics with less than 8 
million people demand sovereignty but quite another if the ukraine 
with a powerful industrial and agricultural base and close ethnic 
ties to russia does the same 
the ukraines communist party leadership has moved slowly in 
coming to grips with demands by informal political groups but it is 
considering legislation that would make ukrainian the official 
language such laws have been the starting point for strong ethnic 
movements in other soviet regions 
ukrainians have flooded a downtown lvov park with flowers in an 
informal memorial to their national poet taras shevchenko the 
yellowandblue ukrainian national flag representing golden wheat 
and blue sky flies constantly crowds gather to debate the latest 
political news and sing ukrainian national songs 
ivan g postoronko the communist party chief in the 
ivanofrankovsk region of the western ukraine told a party meeting 
in moscow in july that the activity of the underground ukrainian 
catholic or uniate church was increasing alarmingly 
the socalled uniate question is nothing more than a cover for 
nationalism he said 
when world war ii came some ukrainians cooperated with the 
nazis and in its official accounts the soviet union blames the 
resistance after world war ii on collaborators the official version 
is especially harsh on the ukrainian catholic church 
the church was forced to merge with the russian orthodox church 
after the war and believers were repressed but it has continued to 
exist ukrainian nationalists are demanding that the church be 
legalized 
vitovich said the helsinki group is seeking to work with other 
informal political groups to gradually win more freedom for the 
republic 
without the establishment of sovereignty return of our 
national symbols and selfaccounting its not possible to solve the 
separate language problem vitovich said it can be solved only 
as a complex

bob hope keeps voluminous files including the 
jokes he delivered and people he has performed with and his first 
entry under lucille ball is an appearance with hope in 1945 on a 
show called gi journal 
i really cant remember many details about it said hope who 
pays tribute to his frequent costar in an nbc special saturday 
night its called bob hopes love affair with lucille ball she 
died in april of this year 
that first time together was followed by four movies frequent 
visits by hope on i love lucy and regular appearances by lucy on 
his television shows 
lucy was a very funny woman hope said even in private she 
could get off a great ad lib but its hard to compare her with 
other funny women its like asking whos the best golfer you have 
to go to the records i dont think anyone ever had the success she 
had she certainly holds the most records 
a secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of 
one of two vaults where hope keeps everything pertaining to his long 
comic career there are written records of all his shows copies of 
all the scripts monologues and comic routines audio tapes of his 
radio shows and thousands of other mementos 
gi journal was on may 4 1945 hopes file reads spot 
lucille ball english play for charity bazaar 
hope and ball had actually known each other before they began 
working together in fact the late desi arnaz her then husband 
worked for hope first 
he said ball asked him nearly 50 years ago to find a place on his 
popular radio show for band leader arnaz 
stan kenton was leaving as my orchestra leader hope said 
i gave desi a spot on my show we also gave him some lines to 
speak every time he walked up to the microphone he dropped an 
enchilada he could hardly talk let alone get a laugh when they 
started i love lucy i said whats going on this man is 
funny 
the night before she died i performed at the music center he 
said lucy was in the hospital and i saw her daughter lucie 
arnaz and said isnt it wonderful shes doing better they 
called me the next day and said she had died i said god has her 
now but well have her forever well be watching her performances 
for a long long time 
bob hopes love affair with lucy will include clips from 
their movies and tv appearances plus such guest stars as betty 
white george burns and danny thomas 
im going through everything myself picking out the clips 
hope said the last time she was on my show was my birthday show 
two years ago we sang i remember it well our last time together 
in public was at the academy awards in march i think ill do my 
tribute to her over a shot of that in the background i think 
everyone remembers that 
she was on his radio show on may 27 1947 at detroit the 
program notes say lucille ball new york clothes cars 
pictures 
i could do a fashion show with her walking on stage hope 
said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the 
special she had great gowns and hairdos when she performed she 
would use different styles shed change the way she read a line 
shed throw a line away one time then shed turn around and milk a 
line for laughs 
hope recalled his funny costar in a sunny alcove in the living 
room of his los angeles home it overlooks the onehole golf course 
in the back yard and he was attired in golfing clothes 
occasionally he called his office in another building on the 
grounds to check on a piece of information soon after the 
interview he was aboard a plane for a series of personal 
appearances around the country 
ball made 22 appearances on hopes specials and he was on her 
shows 10 or 12 times he said 
in their first movie sorrowful jones in 1949 hope played a 
racetrack bookie whos forced to become the foster father of a young 
girl whose real father was killed by gangsters in a racehorse fix 
ball was a nightclub singer who helps him look after the girl it 
was a remake of little miss marker which starred shirley temple 
in 1934 
next was fancy pants in 1950 a remake of ruggles of red 
gap ball played a rich rancher who acquires an english butler 
played by hope facts of life was in 1960 with hope and ball as 
married lovers who have a tryst their last film was critics 
choice in 1963 in which hope is a broadway critic who has to 
review a play written by his wife played by ball

the nations governors preparing for the first 
presidential summit since the depression are tackling a tough 
assignment how to shore up americas failing school system 
few substantive results are expected from the sept 2728 session 
at the university of virginia in charlottesville but some governors 
say the summit may bring muchneeded attention to the issue 
most americans still believe that when we talk about a crisis 
in education we are talking about someone elses kid in some other 
school said new jersey gov thomas h kean who has earned a 
reputation as an education leader in his nearly eight years in 
office 
if the presidential summit can turn that attitude around and 
highlight the need for a national focus on education that will be a 
major achievement 
florida gov bob martinez said the presidential emphasis on 
education will make it a major issue in every state 
the white house has not released an agenda but governors 
responding to a presummit poll by the associated press said the 
three key issues were expected to be increased federal financing 
less government meddling and more parental control popularly 
called choice 
the governors expect the sessions will be closed to allow open 
discussion between them and bush 
the meeting is only the third such policy session called by an 
american president theodore roosevelt held a meeting in 1908 to 
deal with the ravaging of forests and franklin roosevelt called an 
emergency meeting in 1933 for economic recovery talks in the midst 
of the depression 
the decline of education first gained nationwide attention in 
1983 with the governments nation at risk report that warned of 
students academic failures statistics have shown little 
improvement since 
the cost of education continues to soar with the administration 
projecting that federal state and local spending will reach a 
record 353 billion 
the federal government spends a little under 2 percent of its 
overall budget or 22 billion on education the federal share of 
the nations total education spending has fallen to about 6 percent 
from around 9 percent in 1980 
bush has offered a 441 million package of increases that include 
money to reward good schools and teachers create magnet schools and 
promote alternate teacher certification systems 
new york gov mario cuomo criticized the bush administration for 
worrying more about summits than spending federal money on education 
if the education summit becomes a cheerleading session in which 
the president encourages us to raise local taxes we dont need a 
summit said cuomo a democrat we dont need to be encouraged 
to spend we need help 
another democrat idaho gov cecil andrus complained that the 
federal government has decreased its funds to the state by more than 
7 percent a year for the last two years mainly by changing various 
educational formulas 
we at the state level are making an honest effort to make 
progress andrus said the republican legislature is working 
with us were making an effort but everytime we take two steps 
forward they take some federal money away and we lose a step 
ohio gov richard celeste said a dramatic retreat in college 
grants and financial assistance means more students must turn to 
loans to continue their education that keeps many blacks and 
hispanics from college because they view those loans as a form of 
servitude celeste said 
indiana gov evan bayh said the federal government should fully 
finance such early childhood programs as headstart the highly 
acclaimed program provides education social medical and 
nutritional services to only 20 percent of the lowincome preschool 
children who need it 
gov george sinner of north dakota said bush should target more 
federal aid to rural schools which need money to expand their often 
limited courses 
the key is to make sure that we help him find the money and 
that its focused on things like early childhood education drug 
education rewarding excellence employability dropout reduction 
good citizenshp said michigan gov james blanchard a democrat 
we need to put some meat on the bush proposal 
iowa gov terry branstad said the best hope was to persuade the 
administration to give the states more flexibility 
when they give you the money theyre going to call the shots 
said montana republican gov stan stephens and i think the shots 
are best called for education at the local level first the state 
level second and the federal level third 
many states face high dropout rates but even those states with 
relatively low rates are worried 
south dakota gov george mickelson said his states dropout rate 
still among the nations lowest is creeping upward the state 
ranked fifth lowest in 1982 eighth lowest in 1986 and now is 12th 
lowest 
the centerpiece of bushs education initiatives is choice 
allowing parents to decide what school their children will attend 
among the governors however there is no clear consensus on the 
issue 
minnesota democratic gov rudy perpich is a key promoter of the 
choice programs under way in his state and has touted the concept 
nationally 
gov michael s dukakis of massachusetts favors parental choice 
programs if they contain careful safeguards to prevent 
discrimination and resegregation the state legislature is 
considering such a program 
our educational policy said tennessee gov ned mcwherter 
favors the concept of neighborhood schools whenever possible to 
allow communities and parents to have more involvement 
virtually all the governors oppose national standards for 
education curriculum but consider uniform standards for teachers 
more palatable however a recent nationwide poll of parents found 
strong support for national curriculum standards 
rhode island gov edward d diprete says standardized curricula 
often resulted in rather unexciting seamless textbook versions of 
all manner of essential debates that have their place in history 
science and literature 
while a minimum level of performance might seem a rational 
response for the nation it runs the risk of simply becoming the 
least common denominator diprete said 
some governors are expected to tout pet projects at the summit 
oklahoma gov henry bellmon favors longer school years and even 
a longer school day while nevada gov bob miller has signed into 
law a plan to lower the pupilteacher ratio in public schools 
gov gerald l baliles said virginia has begun a literacy program 
requiring students to pass reading and math tests before being 
admitted to high school state schools also are being required to 
keep track of dropouts interviewing students and parents about why 
the student wants to leave school 
the opportunity for the governors and the president to sit down 
and discuss openly education issues and a national agenda for 
education will be invaluable said kansas gov mike hayden a 
republican

drexel burnham lambert inc is paying for the 
defense of its indicted former chief junk bond trader michael 
milken while providing potentially damaging information about him 
to prosecutors 
but both government and drexel officials say the unusual 
arrangement is legal does not pose a conflict of interest for the 
wall street firm and does not violate its plea agreement that 
settled securities fraud charges 
weve got a criminal investigation and prosecution going on 
assistant us attorney john k carroll said tuesday its about 
historic acts its irrelevant who cuts a check to pay what lawyer 
carroll said drexel is not violating any agreement with the 
government by paying lawyers fees for milken who records show made 
more than 1 billion from 1984 to 1987 drexel has agreed to sever 
all business ties with milken 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the firm under company 
policy also is paying the legal fees for other employees involved 
in the continuing investigation of trading practices involving 
drexel its employees and clients 
under its plea agreement with federal prosecutors finalized 
monday drexel is immune from further criminal charges but must 
cooperate with the us attorneys office investigation 
drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts and immediately paid 
more than 500 million of its 673 million in fines and penalties 
the plea in which drexel admitted it manipulated stock and 
defrauded investors and customers ended nine months of wrangling 
over an agreement that avoided a possible racketeering indictment 
milken remains government target no 1 and prosecutors have 
promised a new broader set of charges about oct 1 that should bear 
out some of drexels cooperation 
drexel also has given the government dozens of documents and 
trading records the firm has hired an outside accountant to analyze 
some of the records whenever prosecutors wish to speak with 
employees drexel has to make them accessible under its pleabargain 
agreement 
us attorney benito romano said the government is pleased with 
the extent of drexels cooperation 
several drexel traders and other employees currently are 
answering prosecutors questions some such as salesman james dahl 
have been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for their 
testimony others such as chief junk bond trader warren trepp have 
refused to answer any questions 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg were charged in a 98count securities fraud indictment in 
march alleging racketeering insider trading tax fraud and other 
violations 
those charges focus on alleged collusion between milken and 
jailed stock speculator ivan boesky but the new indictment now 
under preparation is expected to contain broader charges 
prosecutors plan to identify but not charge drexel clients 
solomon asset management and columbia savings amp loan association in 
the expanded indictment according to a report tuesday in the 
washington post boeskys firm and the defunct princetonnewport 
partners lp were named in the original charges 
the government will allege that milken directed a series of 
illegal stock and bond trading arrangements with the clients the 
newspaper said prosecutors are assembling witnesses to testify 
about the alleged dealings at milkens trial scheduled to begin 
next march the report said 
columbias general counsel ken heitz has acknowledged that the 
los angelesbased thrift tried to implement its tax planning 
through heavy yearend trades with drexel and other firms but 
denied any wrongdoing the post reported 
attempts to reach david solomon former head of solomon asset 
management failed tuesday the firm has changed its name and said 
solomon no longer worked there 
carroll declined to comment on the report milkens public 
relations spokesman said in a statement the continuing press 
leaks related to the case are designed to deny mike milken his right 
to a fair trial mike milken has pleaded not guilty and will fight 
the charges in court not in the newspaper 
in addition to the milkens and newberg other drexel employees 
are expected to be charged in the new indictment at least four 
drexel officials late last year were told by the government to 
expect charges a person involved in the case said tuesday he knew 
of no others

texas air corp the nations largest airline 
company it at a critical point in its history as chairman frank 
lorenzo faces shareholders here today at a longdelayed annual 
meeting 
eastern airlines one of its two main subsidiaries is in its 
seventh month of a bitter strike and tortuous bankruptcy proceeding 
the miamibased carrier recently disclosed to creditors that it will 
have about 370 million less in cash by year end than first 
projected having abandoned a plan to sell its latin american routes 
as a result texas air may underwrite some of easterns 
operations a prospect unlikely to cheer texas air shareholders a 
hearing is scheduled for today in us bankruptcy court in new york 
on a proposal for texas air to pay part of a 100 million eastern 
pension payment due friday 
while eastern has been buffeted since early march by the strike 
by machinists union members pilots and flight attendants its 
sister carrier continental airlines appeared to enjoy stability 
and even turned a modest profit but in a surprise move lorenzo 
announced aug 24 that he was considering selling all or part of the 
houstonbased carrier 
the noise at striketorn eastern was hurting nonunion 
continentals business lorenzo recently explained 
we have to be responsible to our shareholders he said we 
have an obligation to look for alternatives 
texas air which lorenzo aggressively built from a small 
intrastate carrier into an airline empire could be shaken to its 
foundations if continental were sold many observers believe the 
wily airline chief would move to liquidate troubled eastern and get 
out of the business altogether 
the question is whether he has had enough whether hes having 
serious misgivings about staying in the industry period said 
louis marckesano an airline analyst with janney montgomery scott 
inc a philadelphia brokerage this may be some sort of a swan 
song 
it may be an opportune moment for such a departure the airline 
industry has been gripped by a takeover frenzy in recent months 
catapulting stocks of major carriers to high altitudes 
a group led by california investor alfred checchi recently 
acquired northwest airlines parent nwa inc for 4 billion while 
united airlines parent ual corp is being ardently pursued by 
investor marvin davis and a pilotmanagement group allied with 
british airways plc 
the wave has swept up texas air stock too despite the strife at 
eastern the companys shares have soared from about 9 or 10 at 
the beginning of the year to near 20 currently they rose 375 
cents tuesday to close at 1962 on the american stock exchange 
in the second quarter texas air posted a 1093 million net 
loss as easterns 1293 million loss outweighed a 321 million 
profit at continental the 1093 million loss compares with a 
2559 million loss for the same quarter last year 
texas airs revenue dropped to 14 billion from 21 billion in 
the quarter reflecting the sharp reduction in easterns operations 
during the mayjuly period 
there was a slim ray of hope this week for a possible resolution 
of the eastern debacle as a federal mediator met in washington on 
monday with company officials and with leaders of the pilots union 
tuesday 
lorenzo has met with donald j trump in an effort to persuade the 
new york developer to buy continental according to trump shuttle 
president bruce nobles in early june after a series of setbacks 
trump finally bought easterns northeast shuttle service from texas 
air for 365 million 
other possible buyers of continental or part of it could include 
scandinavian airlines system which has a 10 percent interest in 
texas air and pan am corp which has expressed a desire to merge 
with another airline under us law foreign airlines are allowed 
to buy up to 25 percent of american carriers 
there also has been speculation that carl icahn the owner and 
chairman of trans world airlines inc may be interested in a 
combination with continental on the eastern front the airline 
announced tuesday that the bankruptcy court had approved its 210 
million agreement to sell midway airlines 16 dc9 aircraft spare 
engines and parts philadelphia gates and related facilities route 
authority linking philadelphia with montreal and canada and 
highdensity operating slots at washington and new york 
eastern also announced plans for new service to cancun mexico 
and mexico city later this year

directors of troubled campeau corp have approved 
a plan to sell its crown jewel the bloomingdales department store 
chain and to accept a loan from a real estate firm as part of a 
restructuring of the torontobased retailer 
meanwhile tuesday shopping mall developer crown american corp 
confirmed its interest in acquiring bloomingdales 
we are still in the process of gathering information said 
frank pasquerilla crown americans chairman and chief executive 
officer 
at this point we are interested in keeping the 16store chain 
and its operations intact he said in a statement released by 
crown americans headquarters in johnstown pa he added that any 
bid probably would be in excess of 1 billion 
campeau board members meeting privately in toronto agreed to 
put bloomingdales on the block and approved a proposal aimed at 
coping with a cash crunch 
campeau stock fell 25 cents to close at 1687 canadian dollars 
in toronto stock exchange trading tuesday the announcement of the 
boards decisions was made after the market closed 
campeau management unveiled the restructuring plan friday saying 
it was designed to reduce debt and address a need for working 
capital the sale of bloomingdales would be a key element of the 
overhaul 
as one of the bestknown names in retailing new yorkbased 
bloomingdales was expected to attract significant interest among 
potential buyers 
crown american a privately held company founded by pasquerilla 
is one of the countrys biggest shopping mall developers it owns 30 
enclosed malls and nine community shopping centers plus 19 hotels 
and five office buildings its hotels include comfort inns hotel 
ibis and compri hotels 
in 1979 crown american bought hesss department stores of 
allentown pa hesss now has 72 stores up from 17 a decade ago 
the only other potential rival for bloomingdales to come forward 
so far is the department store chains chairman and chief executive 
marvin s traub who last week said he was in the early stages of 
putting together a buyout proposal 
traub in an interview friday wouldnt say what price he might 
offer for bloomingdales or comment on where he might obtain 
financing he said he was still contacting lawyers and investment 
bankers 
traub said he has been interested in taking control of the 
retailer he has headed for 11 years since the time when campeau 
became embroiled in a bidding battle for bloomingdales parent 
federated department stores inc with rival rh macy amp co inc 
the takeover of federated completed about a year and a half ago 
cost campeau 67 billion and contributed to the canadian companys 
precarious financial condition 
campeau which bought allied stores corp in 1986 for 34 
billion is struggling with a debt burden approaching 10 billion 
a sale of bloomingdales could raise 1 billion to 2 billion 
wall street analysts say and chop an estimated 200 million off 
campeaus annual 1 billion in interest payments 
a pressing concern for campeau this week is a loan of about 400 
million left over from acquiring federated unless refinanced the 
loan converts into notes and warrants of federated stock this week 
among elements of the restructuring plan approved in principle 
tuesday by campeaus board was a 250 million loan from 
torontobased olympia amp york developments ltd which has an 118 
percent stake in campeau 
the funds from olympia amp york which analysts speculated might be 
given in exchange for a larger stake in campeau were expected to 
allow campeau to cover its immediate cash needs 
retail analysts said an intense bidding battle could develop for 
bloomingdales a highprofile retailer usually considered to be on 
the cutting edge of fashion merchandising 
its going to be similar to the federated feud said analyst 
linda r morris of pnc financial corp in pittsburgh 
rumors that possibly as many as a dozen retailers and real estate 
holding companies were considering making offers circulated in the 
stock market among the names cited were limited inc a leading 
specialty apparel retailer a spokeswoman at the chains columbus

houston auto dealer alan helfman will be scaling 
back his orders for 1990 model cars and trucks even though he has 
just five 1989 models left on his lot 
helfman general manager of river oaks chryslerplymouth in that 
texas city isnt alone other dealers nationwide say they too will 
trim their orders for the next model years vehicles due out next 
month mainly because of pressure from their own inventories and 
sagging sales 
im probably going to cut them back a touch helfman said 
tuesday i think we will be a little more conservative this year 
when you look at everything youve got to really forecast and 
youve got to be conservative 
after a few strong sales periods recently yeartodate car and 
light truck sales through the end of last month were running 37 
percent behind last years pace 
while thats better than at the end of march when sales were 
down 89 percent compared with that time last year industry experts 
expect the market to contract in the early 1990s 
sales figures for the first 10 days of september from the major 
automakers are due today 
theres a trend among dealers to get to a lower inventory 
said jake kelderman executive director of industry affairs for the 
national automobile dealers association in mclean va 
he estimated that dealers would aim for a 45 to 60day supply of 
cars on their lots in the coming year a 60day supply used to be 
the norm he said 
each of the automakers has predicted 1989 modelyear sales well 
below the previous years 158 million the 1990 model year could be 
worse yet although no recession is forecast 
interest rates which determine how much dealers pay to buy cars 
on credit from the manufacturers have been relatively steady 
recently but it still costs money to keep cars on the lot 
perhaps the biggest uncertainty is whether automakers will stay 
in the incentive war they have been waging since early spring 
dealers often carry more stock during heavy incentive periods than 
during other times 
youve got to really watch it now helfman said there have 
been a lot of negative economic articles and its kind of getting 
dealers scared 
manufacturers are cutting and slicing and dicing theyre 
expecting very very hard times he said it scares me that if 
thats going to be the case youve got some blood ready to be 
spilled 
helfman said he planned well and has just five 1989 cars on his 
lot but hes going to trim his upcoming orders to a 45day target 
down slightly from previous years and rely more on swapping cars 
with other dealers as orders come in 
i think id rather give up a little profit and find the car for 
those people who want a special kind of car and deal out of other 
peoples inventory he said 
the big three general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp trotted out enhanced incentive plans in late march and early 
april and during the last several months manufacturers have 
offered rebates to dealers too giving them the option of using 
that money for advertising or to cut the price of 1989 cars 
for automakers thats a gamble with potentially high stakes as 
the model year draws to a close which for bookkeeping purposes 
happens at the end of this month 
i just hope that it works said herb adcox owner of adcox 
chevrolet in chattanooga tenn a longtime general motors dealer 
if it doesnt youve got a lot of dealers who are not going to 
order as many 1990 models 
sometimes they call it generous motors he said were 
going to find out just how generous they are

the international tug of war over the british 
conglomerate bat industries plc lurched back to capitol hill with a 
top senate republican urging the bush administration to stay out of 
the takeover fight 
sen bob packwood of oregon in a letter to secretary of state 
james a baker disclosed tuesday said the us government should 
take no action to avoid the appearance of unreasonable 
government interference 
packwood ranking minority member of the senate finance 
committee sent similar letters to treasury secretary nicholas 
brady us trade representative carla hills and securities and 
exchange commission chairman david s ruder 
ruder has already informed several congressmen that the sec does 
not believe it has the authority to do more than monitor the 
takeover bid for bat which owns several major us companies 
the packwood letter was the latest development in an 
international legal and public relations tug of war since hoylake 
investments ltd a consortium headed by anglofrench financier sir 
james goldsmith launched a 21 billion bid for bat the worlds 
largest tobacco company in late july 
bat whose us holdings include brown amp williamson tobacco 
corp the saks fifth avenue and marshall field department stores 
and farmers insurance group has vowed to fight the unsought 
takeover 
packwoods sept 6 letter was in sharp contrast to a letter sent 
to baker last month cosigned by more than 200 members of the house 
and senate asking him to express their concern to the british 
government about the multinational leveraged buyout 
senate aides who spoke on condition that they not be identified 
said packwood wrote the letter on his own and it did not reflect the 
views of other republicans on the committee 
because goldsmith has a reputation for taking over companies and 
then breaking them up and selling off the pieces labor unions in 
this country have condemned the takeover as a potential threat to 
about 55000 us workers 
and 209 members of congress both democrats and republicans 
wrote baker about their concern the deal eventually would 
dismantle a company that is important to hundreds of us 
communities 
although i am sympathetic to my colleagues concerns about the 
uncertainties new ownership of business entities in their 
communities might raise i frankly cannot see a proper role for the 
federal government under us law or the united states open 
investment policy in this transaction packwoods letter said in 
part 
i would appreciate your assurances that the administration will 
remain true to its open investment policy by taking no action in 
this transaction that might be construed as unreasonable government 
interference he wrote

scandinavian airline systems said 
wednesday it has no immediate interest in buying all or part of the 
texas air corps subsidiary continental airlines 
sas managing director jan carlzon released the statement as an 
answer to recent speculation around sas and its cooperation 
partner continental airlines 
the wall street journal reported last month that sas was involved 
in advanced talks with texas air which had said it may consider 
selling a minority or controlling interest in continental 
the governments of sweden denmark and norway own half of sas 
and the other half is in private or corporate hands 
the cooperation between sas and cointinental is already a great 
success and has given sas an excellent vantage point to service the 
american market carlzon said 
if texas air decided to sell continental sas of course would 
guard its interests he said adding that sas was so pleased 
with the current cooperation that the issue of buying continental 
for the time being is not of immediate interest 
sas which has a 99 percent stake in texas air would not be 
able to buy continental outright since foreign companies are barred 
from having more than a 25 percent share in a us carrier 
sas and continental began work in june 1988 on a joint marketing 
agreement

consulting concern where he will be senior vice president in its

bringing his unique experience as an sec commissioner and former 
chief economist of the sec to our firm lexecon president andrew 
rosenfield said in a statement

two partners in the accounting giant coopers amp 
lybrand say they will appeal an order barring them from practicing 
before the securities and exchange commission for the next five 
years 
an administrative judge in a ruling announced tuesday found 
david j checkosky and norman a aldrich had engaged in blatant 
serious unprofessional conduct 
following 30 days of hearings 13 witnesses and 350 exhibits the 
administrative judge ruled in favor of the sec which claimed 
checkosky and aldrich violated generally accepted standards of 
auditing and principles of accounting in audits their firm did for 
savin corp which markets copy machines 
financial information provided in the audits portrayed the 
company as a far more successful business enterprise than it was 
according to the judges ruling 
its fair to characterize the judges decision as outrageous 
said geoffrey f aronow an attorney for both men who worked in 
coopers amp lybrands stamford conn headquarters 
aronow accused the administrative judge brenda p murray of of 
ignoring large portions of the evidence in the record and said 
she has misapplied the applicable auditing principles and 
misconstrued the underlying regulatory legal standards that apply 
here 
he said his clients intend to appeal to the commission and 
believe the propriety of their actions will ultimately be 
vindicated 
there were no allegations of wrongdoing against savin in the sec 
action but several investors lawsuits are pending in connecticut 
a spokesman for coopers amp lybrand was not available for comment 
savin has been a client of coopers amp lybrand one of the nations 
largest accounting firms since the mid1960s 
the judge noted that annual billings from savin totaled about 
340000 
for professional reasons it was important to both men that the 
client be pleased with their efforts unfortunately pleasing the 
client became their paramount consideration she wrote in a 
68page opinion 
checkosky and aldrich were the senior people assigned to the 
savin audits in question for fiscal years 1981 through 1984 
savins fiscal year ran from may 1 to april 30 
the sec charged among other things that the two partners did 
not adequately plan the audits did not exercise due care in 
examining savin financial statements and did not obtain sufficient 
credible evidence to back up the opinions they submitted in sec 
documents 
according to the judges finding the partners wrongly claimed it 
was proper to defer as startup costs the costs savin incurred in 
developing a new copier 
she found the secs evidence persuasive that during the time 
covered by the audits savin should have listed its costs as 
research and development expenses 
by deferring rather than expensing savin kept these costs from 
increasing its net operating loss during the period in question 
instead these costs were included as assets on savins balance sheet 
and increased owners equity

executives of inland steel industries inc and 
nippon steel corp say customers are already lining up to purchase 
coated steel from a soontobebuilt 450 million facility in 
indiana 
the two steelcoating lines called in kote should strengthen 
inlands position as a supplier to the appliance and auto 
industries primary markets for corrosionresistant coated steel 
products said frank luerssen chairman and chief executive officer 
of the company 
the move will measureably strengthen our joint commitment to 
meet the needs for differentiated steel products in the american 
market luerssen said at a news conference tuesday we now see 
customers lining up to get their share of the materials 
the two production lines will have an annual capacity of 900 
finished tons and will be constructed next to a nearly completed new 
carlisle ind plant where inland and nippon are finishing work on 
a continuous coldrolling mill called in tek 
in tek and inland steels indiana harbor works in east chicago 
ind will provide all the sheet steel for in kote 
the 900 million complex being built at new carlisle ind by 
chicagobased inland and tokyobased nippon is believed to represent 
the largest spending program so far for an americanjapanese joint 
venture in the united states 
the new coating lines will take the coldrolled steel produced at 
the plant and coat it using an electrogalvanizing process or a 
hotdip line 
automakers use galvanized steels highergrade sheets on exposed 
car panels and hotdipped sheets for such things as panels for light 
truck beds 
inland the sixthlargest steel company in the nation supplies 
the three major us carmakers and major japanese auto manufacturers 
nippon is the largest steel maker in the world exporting about 8 
million tons a year 
hiroshi saito president of nippon said the venture with inland 
represented a joint commitment to japanese carmakers who have built 
us plants and to american companies with a demand for the 
materials 
saito said the new plant will be entirely operational in 1991 
with in tek beginning operations next year 
such ventures he said work to ease tensions about the trade 
imbalance between the united states and japan 
i am confident that this undertaking will play a major symbolic 
role as a constructive attempt to resolve issues between the two 
economies through mutual understanding and cooperation saito said 
in a prepared statement 
nippon and inland will contribute 150 million each to in kote 
with the rest sponsored by debtfinancing inland is assuming 60 
percent of the construction costs for in tek also a joint venture 
inland this year has experienced three consecutive quarterly 
earnings declines blamed partly on seasonal softness in orders but 
luerssen predicted a small gain for the companys fourth quarter

fuji bank ltd plans to buy kleinwort benson 
government securities inc in chicago as part of its business 
expansion in the united states officials said wednesday 
the bank which bought a 249 percent stake in the securities 
firm in january would increase its ownership to 100 percent under 
an agreement with the firms londonbased parent kleinwort benson 
ltd said fuji bank spokesman tomonori kobayashi 
it will probably cost us some 44 million he said 
he said the bank was awaiting approval for the total buyout from 
the us federal reserve board which is examining foreign firms 
access to the japanese government bond market 
the bank hoped for federal reserve approval by the end of the 
year kobayashi added 
fuji bank the no3 japanese bank with assets totaling the 
equivalent of about 351 billion at the end of last year has six 
us branches and bought the us finance company walter e heller 
in 1984 
so this kleinwort is our first securities firm which we 
believe will promote our securities business in the united states 
kobayashi said 
fujis announcement came one day after officials of daiichi 
kangyo bank said the bank was negotiating to buy at least a share of 
cit group a financial services subsidiary of manufacturers hanover 
corp 
if fujis purchase plan goes through japanese banks will be 
managing four of the 42 primary government securities dealers in the 
united states said the nihon keizai shimbun japans leading 
economic journal 
the us central bank voted in august to allow japanese firms to 
continue to act as primary dealers in us treasury securities 
primary dealers which may conduct business in government securities 
directly with the fed have access to advance information about note 
and bond auctions 
the economic journal said japanese banks are actively 
establishing such strengths in the united states mainly because the 
us government has started reconsidering the border line between 
bank and securities operations 
kleinwort benson still holds 100 percent management rights at its 
six branches in the united states said shigemitsu minagawa 
spokesman for the companys tokyo branch established eight years 
ago 
he said fuji bank and kleinwort benson had maintained a 
relationship for quite some time in human resources and investment 
other purchases of us firms by japanese banks include a 1984 
buyout of the bank of california by mitsubishi bank and the bank of 
tokyos purchase of union bank in 1988

the finance ministry said wednesday it has dropped 
plans to sell 195 million shares of nippon telegraph and telephone 
corp stock this year 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told a news conference the 
decision was based on various factors including the slump in ntt 
share prices 
the government had planned to sell 195 million ntt shares in 
fiscal 1989 which ends next march 31 after parliament approved the 
sale to finance public works and the redemption of outstanding 
government bonds said a finance ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
since ntt the former government monopoly in telecommunications 
was turned into a private firm on april 1 1985 the government has 
sold 54 million shares 35 percent of the shares it owned 
in april 1987 two months after the stock was first offered a 
single share of ntt stock was worth 318 million yen or about 
21600 ntt stock closed at 151 million yen or about 10272 
wednesday 
ntt posted a 143 percent decline in unconsolidated pretax 
profits for the fiscal year that ended march 31 
officials attributed the decline to lower longdistance revenues 
caused by competition from new entrants in the market and to a 
slump in revenue from data communications services 
the companys chairman hisashi shinto resigned last december 
after being implicated in the recruit scandal and was arrested in 
march on bribery charges 
the recruit co an information services conglomerate has been 
accused of using cutprice stock sales and political donations to 
try to buy influence with a wide range of politicians bureaucrats 
and businessmen although ntt now is a private firm its employees 
are treated the same as public officials under laws covering bribery

luxury auto maker jaguar plc on wednesday posted an 
aftertax loss of 17 million for the first half of the year 
citing a decline in us sales adverse currency factors and a 
large depreciaton charge 
these negative factors were partly offset by improvements in cost 
efficiency the company said 
the loss for the six months ended june 30 compared with an 
aftertax profit of 21 million or 11 cents a share in the same 
period a year earlier 
the company said its pretax profit sank to 22 million from 35 
million a year ago 
sales climbed 3 percent to 869 million from 832 million 
the depreciation charge for plant and equipment came to 55 
million up from 42 million in the yearearlier period 
jaguar said sales in its key us market deteriorated sharply 
during the secondquarter and that they were well below 
expectations us sales rose 14 percent to 399 million in the 
period 
the company said that fiercer competition forced it to raise its 
marketing expenditure in the region jaguar is forecasting us 
sales of around 20000 cars in the current year compared with 
20700 in 1988 
jaguar said halfyear sales in britain were on a par with year 
earlier levels but that there was some uncertainly about overall 
demand due to the countrys high interest rates 
jaguar said it hoped to maintain good sales progress in 
continental europe where sales declined 17 percent to 109 million 
overall jaguar said it didnt envisage any improvement in its 
underlying trading conditions during the rest of the year however 
the company said the introduction of new models was expected to 
enhance demand 
jaguar did not produce quarterly results it isnt required to 
under british law

the bush administration is gearing up for a 
major campaign to encourage americans to save more money and urge 
us companies to make longterm investments rather than chasing 
fastbuck takeover deals 
weve been willing to mortgage our future to sacrifice quality 
and to cut corners in the pursuit of the immediate payoff 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said tuesday night the united 
states needs to make fundamental changes in its economic affairs or 
risk losing out to international competitors he warned 
brady indicated the administration is considering ways to expand 
tax incentives to encourage individual savings proposals to 
eliminate the doubletaxation of stock dividends and initiatives 
that would encourage corporate managers to focus more on longterm 
performance 
our approach to the challenges of the 1990s and beyond should 
be to maintain our competitiveness where its strong and to rebuild 
it where it has faltered brady said in a speech billed as the 
opening salvo in the administrations new campaign 
brady said other nations are challenging americas economic 
leadership because the country has grown complacent with too many 
corporate executives chasing quick profits rather than investing for 
longterm performance 
it worries me when i see many of the best minds in america 
concentrating on financial engineering rather than laying plans for 
sound corporate strategies for the future brady told members of 
the american business conference who were invited to dinner at the 
treasury department 
bradys comments received a generally warm response from the 
executives 
american stock exchange chairman arthur levitt jr told brady 
that many of his suggestions were similar to proposals by the 
business conference which earlier this year called for a major 
government effort to boost the nations savings rate to lower the 
cost of capital for us businesses 
brady however conceded that the administration hasnt found an 
answer to the key problem raised by the proposals how should they 
be funded 
suggestions to expand taxdeferred savings plans such as 
individual retirement accounts could cost 15 billion over five 
years while any proposal to eliminate the double taxation of 
corporate dividends might cost as much as 40 billion annually 
the 1986 tax law sharply curbed ira tax benefits for couples 
making more than 40000 a year or individuals earning more than 
25000 and covered by a company retirement plan 
brady said the administration is currently wrestling with the 
cost question he said final decisions probably will not come until 
president bush presents his next budget to congress in january 
what we have done is commit ourselves to the kind of program 
that i have outlined he said we are going to make it work 
part of the administrations competitiveness program includes the 
presidents push to lower the capital gains tax rate 
on tuesday sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and the chairman of the 
senate finance committee proposed offering deductible iras to all 
taxpayers as a substitute for reducing the tax on capital gains 
brady said expanding iras is being reviewed by the 
administration but he said the president remains committed to 
getting a cut in the capital gains rate 
brady said the administrations proposals were aimed at lowering 
the cost of businesses to raise needed capital to make longterm 
investment 
if we provided for more of our domestic investment needs with 
our savings wed have to import less capital from abroad thus 
improving our trade balance brady said 
brady said the administration will be looking at a number of 
options that give people the incentive to save instead of to 
consume

statistics in the report 
domestic demand for oil and petroleum products declined 
slightly in august to 17438 million barrels a day from 17482

americans shouldnt let minors buy cigarettes 
from vending machines any more than they would tolerate machines 
selling liquor to anyone with the correct change surgeon general c 
everett koop told congress today 
the machines give youngsters easy access to tobacco and send a 
message that this country isnt worried that they will become 
addicted koop said 
there is no logical reason why we should have a double standard 
for controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol the two major legal 
addicting drugs used in our society he told a congressional 
hearing 
would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages through 
vending machines would we allow free samples of alcoholic beverages 
to be sent through the mail or passed out on public property of 
course not he said 
koop whose tenure as the nations health policy chief ends this 
month said 43 states have laws on the books banning tobacco sales 
to minors but dont enforce them 
as long as states take no action to enforce these laws i 
support federal efforts to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors 
he said in testimony to the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on transportation and hazardous materials 
subcommittee chairman thomas luken dohio is pressing for a 
federal law restricting tobacco vending machine sales 
at a previous hearing on lukens bill the tobacco institute 
citing a report by a vending machine trade organization the 
national automatic merchandising association said only 2 percent 
of teenage smokers bought their cigarettes from machines 
a federal limit on vending machine sales is a solution in 
search of a problem said institute spokesman charles o whitley 
it would pursue its goal at the cost of severe economic 
consequences for an industry already beset by high taxes and 
burdensome regulation 
whitley told the panel that most cigarette vending machines are 
located in factories offices and other establishments that are not 
open to the publlic or generally are not frequented by persons under 
18 
about eight out of 10 cigarette machines are nowhere near areas 
frequented by teenagers according to the tobacco institute 
testimony 
but koop said that is enough machines to justify federal action 
even if true and im not convinced it is its a poor argument 
against banning vending machine sales of cigarettes koop said in 
his statement even 20 percent of the 374000 vending machines in 
the united states represents a huge number of sites from which 
teenagers can readily obtain cigarettes illegally 
koop also told the panel he opposes the us governments crusade 
to force thailand into repealing its ban on tobacco advertising 
he said america is not respected overseas because of the manner 
in which we export disease and death to underdeveloped countries

currency trading in the united states has more 
than doubled in the last three years to about 129 billion a day 
the federal reserve bank of new york said today 
growth in trading volume has far outpaced the growth in the us 
economy and the expansion of world trade said gretchen greene a 
senior vice president at the central bank 
us businesses need to trade currencies in order to turn their 
earnings from overseas sales or investments back into dollars or to 
obtain foreign currencies for spending in foreign countries 
but the vast majority of the volume of currency trading is simple 
speculation in which banks and other traders buy currencies they 
expect to rise and sell ones they expect to fall 
by taking on extra risk in the hope of profit the speculators 
allow companies that actually need foreign currencies to lay off 
risk by hedging 
although there are no precise estimates of the amount of 
speculation that goes on ms greene said banks did only 12 percent 
of their trading volume with parties that were not themselves 
involved in wholesale currency trading such as industrial companies 
based on a monthlong survey in april the average daily volume of 
currency trading in the united states was 1289 billion up 120 
percent from 585 billion in march 1986 the last time the survey 
was conducted 
the survey covered trading done by 127 banks and 14 nonbank 
financial institutions which are believed to be almost all the ones 
actively involved in currency trading 
the west german mark remained the most actively traded foreign 
currency

senate supporters of a proposed smoking ban on 
all airline flights today scheduled a thursday vote aimed at 
stopping tobacco state lawmakers from blocking the legislation 
the vote was scheduled by senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine after opponents of the ban threatened to hold up unrelated 
spending bills unless a compromise was reached 
tobacco state senators had said earlier that rather than the 
stronger restrictions they would accept a permanent ban on smoking 
aboard airline flights of two hours or less 
were willing to make that permanent sen wendell ford 
dky said of the current smoking ban on twohour flights which is 
due to expire next april 
but he said he would continue opposing a provision permanently 
extending the ban to all flights language that is part of a bill 
providing 119 billion for next years federal transportation 
programs 
this one will take basically a week to get through ford said 
of the transportation bill that would delay approval of other 
spending legislation awaiting senate approval he said 
congressional leaders want to complete work on the transportation 
measure and 12 other spending bills by the oct 1 start of fiscal 
1990 
but the author of the permanent smoking prohibition on all 
flights sen frank lautenberg dnj continued to defend his 
measure and called on opponents of the ban to let work on the bill 
proceed 
if they have a case to make they ought to make it and let us 
vote on it lautenberg said 
the house voted aug 3 to make the ban on twohour flights 
permanent tobacco industry supporters have said they are willing to 
accept that if lautenberg will drop his insistence on the broader 
restrictions 
lautenberg supported by health groups and airline unions argues 
that nonsmoking passengers risk cancer and other diseases because 
of the cigarette smoke they breathe in airline cabins 
the tobacco industry has argued that there is no convincing 
evidence that such smoke is dangerous and that there are other 
chemicals besides cigarette fumes in the recirculated air of 
airliner cabins 
tobacco supporters in congress have also said the restrictions 
would hurt tobacco growers

the government wednesday proposed fining the 
owner of maines largest paper mill nearly 16 million for 531 
alleged safety violations inspectors said left workers at 
substantial risk of death and serious injury 
the labor departments occupational safety and health 
administration said many of the problems found at the boise cascade 
corp mill in rumford maine had been detected in company safety 
audits but left uncorrected 
a government inspection six months ago found a substantial 
disregard by this major corporation for the safety and health of its 
employees said alan c mcmillan acting osha chief 
the inspection of the mill which has 1600 workers was 
requested by the united paperworkers union osha said 
boise cascade has 15 working days to contest the citations and 
the 1591600 in proposed fines boise cascade spokesman eric a 
baxter said the osha complaint would be reviewed item by item 
before any decision is made 
we welcome any effort that will help us improve the safety of 
our mill baxter said safety is the utmost priority here at 
boise cascade 
a nearly 1 billion modernization plan for the mill included 
significant safety improvements he said 
osha cited boise cascade for more than 300 alleged willful 
violations of safety standards including subpar records 
documenting illnesses and injuries unsafe operation of industrial 
trucks failure to protect workers from exposed highvoltage 
electrical equipment improper guarding of power equipment such as 
belts and pulleys and failure to vent gases to safe locations 
other alleged willful violations included failure to install 
guard rails to protect workers from falls unsafe noise exposure 
inadequate emergency response plans and inadequate respiratory 
protections 
willful violations are those in which an employer knows a 
violation or potential violation of safety standards exists but does 
nothing to correct it 
boise cascade also was accused of 175 serious violations 33 
less serious violations and five repeat violations 
serious violations are those in which an employer knew or should 
have known about conditions that pose a substantial probability of 
death or serious injury but doesnt correct the problems 
the company drew attention earlier this week because of a violent 
protest at a minnesota paper mill 
the protest by union workers and supporters was attributed to a 
company decision to hire a nonunion general contractor for a mill 
expansion project who in turn has hired mostly nonunion labor 
twentynine people were arrested at the protest which caused a 
reported 13 million in damage to the international falls minn 
mill near the canadian border

mgmua communications co said today 
that it had received a 135 billion buyout offer from an 
unidentified bidder that would apparently compete with an australian 
companys offer of 12 billion 
mgmua identified the prospective buyer only as a new york stock 
exchangelisted company who it said had offered 2316 per share of 
mgmua common stock and 18 per share of preferred stock 
the proposal values the stock at aout 135 billion or about 
150 million more than the bid for the same stock that qintex 
australia ltd has made through an affiliate 
andrew wallach an analyst who follows mgmua for drexel burnham 
lambert said speculation on the buyer focused on media giants who 
have shown interest in mgmua in the past 
they include 20th century fox owned by rupert murdochs news 
corp sony corp the walt disney co and mca inc 
qintex australia owns 43 percent of qintex entertainment inc a 
tv company that financed part of the cbs miniseries lonesome 
dove and bills itself as australias largest tv production and 
distribution company 
when assumption of debt and other factors are considered the 
qintex bid totals about 135 billion according to qintex 
entertainment executive vice president john lloyd if the same 
factors applied on the new offer details in mgmuas announcement 
were sketchy it would total 15 billion lloyd said 
he said qintex was waiting to learn details about the new offer 
and would have no immediate comment about it 
the qintex deal was to have closed by the end of this month in 
essence it would split the present mgmua communications co and 
leave majority shareholder kirk kerkorian in control of the mgm 
portion of the business 
by the time kerkorian bought back the mgm businesses qintex 
would have paid about 600 million for united artists 
mgmua spokeswoman mary hardy said the companys board will meet 
thursday to consider the latest offer mgmua shareholders were 
scheduled to vote on the qintex offer at a meeting sept 23 mgmua 
has agreed to pay qintex 18 million if it accepts another offer 
ms hardy declined to say whether the latest offer had been 
expected by the board or kerkorian the los angeles billionaire who 
owns 82 percent of mgmuas 506 million common shares of stock and 
all but a tiny fraction of mgmuas 101 million shares of preferred 
stock 
mgmua said nothing about the financing involved in the latest 
offer 
qintex has assembled a group of 10 asian and european investors 
to help finance its deal the investors would buy stock worth 500 
million while qintex group would buy shares worth 100 million 
the renamed united artists corp would be the first big american 
motion picture studio to pass into foreign hands 
united artists one of the five dominant us movie studios 
holds the rights to 4000 movies including the the pink panther 
and james bond series and rocky films 
kerkorians new mgm that he would buy back from qintex would 
include movie and tv production assets and a library of 34 recent 
films including moonstruck and a fish called wanda

a lateafternoon spate of selling drove stock 
prices lower today pushing the dow jones industrial average below 
2700 for the first time in three weeks 
brokers attributed the selloff to rumors which were quickly 
denied that a major brokerage firm was facing losses from a 
position in highyield junk bonds 
analysts said traders were hoping for some positive news later in 
the week to serve as a market stimulus 
for instance the monthly data on the producer price index of 
finished goods due out friday is expected to show no change or a 
modest decline in that measure of inflationary pressures 
but some observers said it may take something more surprising to 
stir stocks out of their recent torpor

somewhere under the rainbow a group of 
tupperware executives broke into a song and dance about the famous 
airtight plastic containers soon some of the other 10000 top 
dealers and family members at the annual corporate jubilee took up 
the chorus 
the celebration once the premier local shindig in the days 
before the central florida themepark boom was held last month 
beneath a 120foot metal rainbow erected behind tupperware world 
headquarters 
the spot seemed appropriate for a company that spent years 
hunting for the pot of gold it lost when waves of working mothers 
and fasterpaced lifestyles made its trademark homeparty sales 
system seem like an ozzie and harriet era anachronism 
the quest to modernize may be starting to pay off for tupperware 
which is a unit of premark international inc 
after a postrecession slump in the mid1980s tupperware home 
parties last year reported sales rose to a record 9671 million 
more than 100000 independent dealers in the united states also a 
record are now out toting their wares from office conference rooms 
to daycare centers 
with more than 80 million people attending a tupperware party 
somewhere last year the company is outselling its nearest kitchen 
container rival rubbermaid inc by nearly 21 
nobody dislikes tupperware the question was how were people 
going to find the time to buy it these days said robert 
donegan vice president of marketing we may have been slower than 
others to respond to the changing lifestyles but i think weve got 
it together now 
today alternatives to the traditional twohour home parties 
account for about 25 percent of total sales of tupperware which was 
pulled from store shelves in april 1951 
dealers are now catching customers during coffee breaks and after 
work a strategy adopted by other giants of the 9 billion 
directsale industry such as avon products inc and fuller brush co 
donegan said one of the most effective new tactics is the 
rushhour party a brief display of products at a house or other 
site along commuter routes 
people dont have a lot of time now so we get right to the 
point show the product answer questions and take the order he 
said 
tupperware this month also began allowing orders by visa and 
mastercard and is testing a system to ship products directly to 
customers rather than via the longer route from distributor to 
dealer 
later this year it may air television spots to show consumers 
how to get in touch with dealers 
since the company began phasing out references to its burp 
seal in 1979 more contemporary pastel and earthtone colors have 
been emphasized and smaller containers emerged to handle leftovers 
of singles and oneparent families 
yet one of the most popular of the nearly 200 products remains 
the original bell tumbler one of 24 tupperware pieces in the 
permanent collection of the museum of modern art in new york 
our products are timeless were just trying to stay up with 
the times in the way we make them available said tupperware 
spokeswoman lawrie pitcher platt 
its also a different brand of sales people although virtually 
all the 350000 independent dealers and distributors worldwide are 
still women the days have passed when tupperware attracted 
housewives with time on their hands but little outside work 
experience many of the new tupperware dealers in the united states 
are college educated and seeking a parttime job or the freedom of 
independent sales 
it looked for a while like we were in big trouble but these 
new women really figured out how to get out there and sell said 
tom damigella 74 an everett massbased distributor who helped 
tupperware founder earl tupper develop the home party concept in the 
late 1940s we got some real bright women out there for us now 
the seed for the tupperware empire was a lump of black 
polyethylene slag a petroleum byproduct tupper a selfeducated 
chemist and tinkerer developed a process to purify the goop into a 
tough yet flexible translucent plastic 
tupper found the nonporous plastic was perfect for food storage 
the airtight seal was modeled after a paint can lid in reverse by 
1945 tupper corp products were appearing in stores but public 
acceptance was slow and consumers were stumped by the seal 
damigella and brownie wise who both sold stanley tools and other 
home products on a home party plan worked with tupper to develop 
its party plan which was nearly unaltered until sales began to drop 
in 1983 
tupper who died in 1983 had sold the company in 1958 to rexall 
drug and chemical co which 11 years later was renamed dart 
industries inc tupperware became a unit of premark international in 
june 1986 when dart amp kraft inc a successor to dart industries 
separated its holdings 
in its 39nation market tupperware has tried to meet some unique 
demands in latin america it produces a tortilla holder japanese 
customers can order a kimono storage bin presently studies are 
under way for possible expansion into china and the soviet union 
but there are no plans to bring tupperware back to stores after 
38 years 
theres sort of a mystique to tupperware and the fact you cant 
just go out and buy it said donegan holding one of the bell 
tumblers the company is a little like the product we may have 
changed a bit over the years but the basic formula doesnt change

a former new york federal reserve bank 
director robert a rough was sentenced to six months in prison 
wednesday for leaking secret interest rate data 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise also ordered the 
50yearold exbanker who made an emotional plea for mercy before 
the sentencing to perform 200 hours of community service during two 
years of probation 
debevoise called the case particularly sad and said he was 
convinced that roughs anguished expression of remorse in his 
remarks to the judge came from the heart 
but he said jail time for rough was essential for the public 
perception of the fairness of the system that white collar 
criminals and those with advantaged backgrounds be properly 
punished 
i breached a trust placed in me and in doing so blemished the 
reputation of the institution i still revere said rough his 
voice quavering with emotion 
he said a picture of former federal reserve board chairman paul 
volcker remains hanging on his wall the federal reserve bank of new 
york is part of the feds regional system 
rough sat on the new york feds board from 1982 to 1984 while 
president of the national bank of sussex county in branchville 
while there rough admitted in a plea bargain he regularly 
disclosed advance word regarding the feds discount rate to a 
nowdefunct livingston brokerage firm bevill bresler amp schulman 
inc the discount rate is the feds interest charge on loans to 
financial institutions 
bevill bresler traded in government securities the market of 
which is powerfully affected by the discount rate 
federal authorities called the case the first to involve insider 
trading of government securities and the first such charges against 
a director in the fed system 
rough could have received up to five years in prison but in an 
unusual move the us attorneys office recommended that if rough 
was sent to prison it should be for less than a year assistant 
us attorney paul weissman in a presentencing memo said rough 
expected no financial gain 
debevoise agreed to recommend that rough serve his sentence 
beginning oct 16 at eglin air force base in florida a minimum 
security prison camp roughs attorney michael himmel who had 
asked for probation said his client would probably serve about 4 
months accounting for time off for good behavior 
roughs career as a prosperous country banker who once 
aspired to be chairman of the federal deposity insurance corporation 
began to unravel in the spring of 1987 when witnesses at the trial 
of bevill bresler president gilbert c schulman disclosed the 
allegations 
rough usually leaked the data to schulman and blamed his actions 
on a misguided friendship with the bevill bresler official 
schulman and four other top executives of the firm were sent to 
prison in connection with its april 1985 collapse 
in his remarks to debevoise rough said his life was in tatters 
following the december 1988 indictment rough said his wife is 
seeking a divorce his funds vanished his career finished his sons 
in trouble with the law and his reputation gone 
i am an outcast in the banking community and my own 
community he said these past few years have been truly a 
living hell 
rough began in the banking world as a bank runner at age 14 and 
started working as a management trainee and auditor at the new york 
fed in 1961 he joined the national bank of sussex eight years 
later and rose to president in 1978 during explosive growth at the 
rural institution 
banking was in his veins he said with his grandfather and 
father in the industry rough said he still wore his fathers 
retirement watch 
rough said he remembered being scolded as a youth by his father 
he would shake his head and say son you let me down god 
knows my dad must be shaking his head now said rough his voice 
choked with emotion

cotton futures prices skyrocketed wednesday on the new york 
cotton exchange climbing as much as 2 cents a pound the permitted 
daily limit on fresh signs of shrinking world supplies 
on other markets grain and soybean futures fell steeply most 
energy futures advanced and precious metals livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
cotton futures settled 113 cents to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in october at 7377 cents a pound 
the rally was rooted partly in tuesdays agriculture department 
crop report which painted an ultimately bullish scenario for 
cotton although it was not apparent at first blush 
for starters the usda estimated the 1989 cotton crop at 1228 
million bales which represents a 20 percent decline from the 1988 
harvest but an increase of 450000 bales from the agencys august 
estimate 
the estimate was higher than expected which would have been a 
bearish signal except that the usda also reduced by 400000 bales 
its estimate of the us cotton stockpile as of last july 31 
offsetting the increased harvest projection 
the bullish news came in the usdas new projection for world 
cotton stocks as of next july 1 252 million bales 1 million less 
than the agency had predicted a month earlier 
world supplies are dwindling analysts said because of poor 
growing weather both in the united states and abroad 
the foreign crops are not doing well especially in china and 
the soviet union said ernest simon cotton specialist in new york 
with prudentialbache securities inc 
the us crop which was punished earlier this year by too much 
rain in the southeast and too little in texas has been taking 
another beating this week due to cold wet weather in the high 
plains of texas 
prospects for at least another day of harsh weather contributed 
to cottons rally 
grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of 
trade in selling sparked by a higher 1989 wheat crop estimate and 
expectations for an increase in 1990 wheat acreage 
the usda raised its projection for the 1989 wheat harvest to 206 
billion bushels from 204 billion surprising traders who had 
expected little change in the number 
further selling was linked to persistent rumors that the 
agriculture department is preparing to revise its 1990 wheat program 
to allow farmers to increase spring wheat planting which is already 
underway by as much as 10 million acres 
walter spilka an analyst in new york with smith barney harris 
upham amp co said that despite the improved 1989 harvest outlook 
us wheat stocks are relatively low 
he said usda leaders are worried the united states may have to 
reduce its wheat exports unless it can ensure an increase in 
supplies 
wheat futures settled 8 cents to 14 cents lower with september at 
385 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with september 
at 233 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
september at 134 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 15 cents 
lower with september at 586 a bushel 
crudeoil futures traded above 20 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange but closed below that level as the technically 
inspired rally ran out of gas 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 16 cents 
higher with october at 1986 a barrel heating oil was 10 cent 
lower to 25 cent higher with october at 5546 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 21 cent to 86 cent higher with october at 
5775 cents a gallon 
gold futures rose slightly while silver inched lower on new 
yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 20 cents higher across the board with october at 
36130 a troy ounce silver was 02 cent to 06 cent lower with 
september at 5067 a troy ounce 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle futures settled 
20 cent lower to 15 cent higher with october at 7202 cents a 
pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 38 cent higher with september 
at 83 cents a pound hogs were 03 cent lower to 55 cent higher 
with october at 3975 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 20 
cent to 32 cent lower with february at 4625 cents a pound

about 100 striking eastern airlines workers and 
their supporters picketed parent company texas air corps annual 
meeting wednesday carrying signs and balloons critical of chairman 
frank lorenzo 
we hope to get rid of mr lorenzo said jim fullerton of 
houston an eastern pilot for 25 years and on strike since march 
i miss flying definitely but im not going to fly for mr 
lorenzos type of management 
all we can do is peacefully demonstrate withhold our services 
and convince people not to fly sister carrier continental airlines 
and get him through his pocketbook 
many of the demonstrators had red and black balloons affixed with 
stickers showing lorenzos name enclosed in a red circle and with a 
slash mark through it 
the demonstration outside the elegant four seasons hotel in 
downtown houston where shareholders met was peaceful and quiet and 
began breaking up as the midafternoon meeting began houston police 
sat in squad cars nearby 
security at the hotel was tight and similar to measures taken for 
a presidential visit uniformed police were stationed at the 
entrances to the meeting room while plainclothes security men were 
obvious elsewhere people attending the meeting had to pass through 
metal detectors 
the machinists union walked out march 9 in the wake of a lengthy 
contract dispute and the pilots and flight attendants joined the 
strike eastern is restructuring under bankruptcy court protection 
as a smaller carrier and has hired hundreds of replacement employees 
when we come back not if this will be the best airline 
youll ever see said al glover a striking machinist who wore a 
frank lorenzo mask and carried a sign proclaiming the texas air 
chairman as the most hated man in america 
inside the hotel lobby was a handful of working eastern pilots 
and flight attendants wearing buttons proclaiming eastern is 
working and so are we 
weve got thick skins we just ignore them sue alfonso an 
eastern agent from atlanta said of the demonstrators were here 
to represent eastern and let everyone know were proud to be 
eastern 
ive been in this all the way said frank barber of miami a 
pilot for 23 years my mind was made up from the beginning my 
main concern is our airlines survival 
he said airline management made the trip to the houston meeting 
available to him if he wanted it but nobody told me what to say 
or do 
barber said the picket line wednesday was no big deal following 
his experiences earlier this year in boston when angry protesters 
smashed the windows out of an eastern van he also said nails had 
been scattered on the driveway of his home his phone rings 
routinely late at night and he gets every magazine published 
because subscriptions have been submitted with his name 
ive started to like some of them barber laughed

a federal judge refused wednesday to dismiss 
civil charges that westinghouse electric corp and a new jersey 
engineering firm bribed former philippines president ferdinand e 
marcos in order to win a nuclear power plant contract 
the ruling by us district judge dickinson r debevoise keeps 
alive a major claim in a broad lawsuit by the present philippine 
government 
debevoise in may shifted 13 of 15 counts of the suit filed six 
months before to arbitration the international chamber of commerce 
will consider breach of contract negligence fraud antitrust and 
other claims 
the suit said massive corruption surrounded the project a 23 
billion 600megawatt plant on the bataan peninsula begun in 1976 
but that has yet to open 
the philippine government is seeking recovery of its investment 
damages and the alleged bribes which the philippines say were 
passed to marcos through consultants linked to him 
pittsburghbased westinghouse the nations leading nuclear power 
plant producer in turn is seeking 30 million in fees through the 
chambers arbitration court the other defendant is burns amp roe 
enterprises inc of oradell 
both companies have denied that consultant fees were bribes 
at wednesdays hearing westinghouse attorney david boies argued 
that because marcos was the philippines absolute power at the time 
a us federal court was not the place to determine whether the 
payments caused him to violate his duty to the nation 
marcos was marcos whatever he was doing he was doing with 
absolute impunity long before westinghouse came on the scene 
boies said 
mark augenblick an attorney for the philippines argued that the 
scope of the deposed dictators power at the time was not important 
marcoss wrongdoing does not mean that the philippine 
constitution and the laws of the philippines do not apply said 
augenblick 
to throw out the remaining two briberelated counts would send 
a message that one can with impunity bribe the president of a 
foreign country and avoid civil penalties in the united states he 
said 
debevoise called the defendants arguments a semantic 
exercise ruling that the legality or illegality of a regime is 
not the issue what is important he said is whether such payments 
were acceptable under applicable law

surgeon general c everett koop criticized us 
tobacco marketing at home and abroad wednesday backing a bill to 
keep cigarette machines away from minors and declaring america is 
not respected overseas because of the manner in which we export 
disease and death 
koop said the epithet ugly american will indeed come home 
to roost in a decade or two when the developing countries of today 
realize what we did to them 
he said the wide availability of cigarette vending machines in 
the united states makes a mockery of laws forbidding minors to buy 
cigarettes 
would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages through 
vending machines he asked would we allow free samples of 
alcoholic beverages to be sent through the mail or passed out on 
public property of course not 
koop in what he said would be his last appearance as surgeon 
general on capitol hill testified at a house subcommittee hearing 
called by antismoking activists in congress 
he supported a bill sponsored by rep thomas luken dohio that 
would forbid the placement of cigarette vending machines in any 
location accessible to people under 18 
during the hearing reps chet atkins dmass and luken both 
took aim at possible bush administration action against thailands 
ban on tobacco advertising comparing the case to the british east 
india cos efforts to develop asian opium markets in the 1800s 
luken is pushing in particular for more restrictions on tobacco 
advertising in this country while atkins wants to make it 
impossible for the united states to challenge any other countrys 
limits on the sale of american cigarettes 
along with koop and other members of congress they are scheduled 
to testify next week at a us trade representative hearing into 
whether thailands tobacco ad ban is an unfair trading practice 
the tobacco institute said the industry has pressed the us 
government to make it easier to sell in korea japan thailand and 
other countries but only to give the us industry a fair shot at 
the existing market for cigarettes 
wherever market barriers exist in foreign countries it is and 
should be our governments policy to eliminate them and promote 
trade throughout the world tobacco institute spokesman charles o 
whitley told the energy and commerce subcommittee on transportation 
and hazardous materials 
as for us sales koop who is retiring this month as the 
nations health policy chief spoke in favor of a provision in 
lukens bill that would restrict vendingmachine cigarette sales 
he said the machines give youngsters easy access to tobacco and 
send a message that this country isnt worried that they will become 
addicted 
there is no logical reason why we should have a double standard 
for controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol the two major legal 
addicting drugs used in our society koop said 
at a previous hearing on lukens bill the tobacco institute 
citing a report by a vending machine trade organization the 
national automatic merchandising association said only 2 percent 
of teenage smokers bought their cigarettes from machines 
whitley told the panel most cigarette vending machines are 
located in factories offices and other establishments that are not 
open to the public or generally are not frequented by persons under 
18 
but koop said even if true and im not convinced it is its 
a poor argument against banning vending machine sales of cigarettes 
even 20 percent of the 374000 vending machines in the united 
states represents a huge number of sites from which teenagers can 
readily obtain cigarettes illegally

rupert murdoch entered the bidding 
for mgmua communication co on wednesday with an offer that values 
the company at 18 billion topping a rival 164 billion bid by an 
australian entertainment group 
the bid was made by the media magnates news corp ltd and its 
20th century fox film corp subsidiary 
analysts said murdoch apparently wants mgmuas huge film 
library which he could use for his fox tv network here and sky 
television satellite operation in europe 
mgmua had agreed to sell its united artists assets to an 
affiliate of qintex australia ltd by the end of this month in a 
deal that valued mgmuas stock at about 124 billion 160 million 
less than the new offer of 14 billion according to mgmua 
spokeswoman mary hardy 
she said the buyer would also assume about 400 million in debt 
mgmua said fox and news corp had offered 2316 for each of the 
approximately 53 million shares of mgmua common stock and 18 per 
share for the more than 10 million shares of preferred stock qintex 
had offered 20 for each common share and 18 per preferred share 
shares of mgmua common stock closed tuesday at 1975 on the new 
york stock exchange a high for the year then surged to 21125 per 
share by the close of trading wednesday qintex plunged 2 to close 
at 6 per share wednesday in overthecounter trading 
confirmation of a rumor earlier wednesday that murdoch was the 
bidder did not come until after the market closed 
news corps american depositary shares are traded on the nyse 
and slipped 12 cents to 25 a share wednesday each news corp ads 
is equivalent to two shares of the australian companys common 
shares 
fox spokesman dennis petroskey confirmed the offer but refused 
to discuss how it would be financed or other issues saying only 
we are in discussions with mgmua we will have no further comment 
until the discussions are concluded 
ms hardy said mgmuas board will meet thursday to consider the 
latest offer mgmua shareholders were scheduled to vote on the 
qintex offer at a meeting sept 23 mgmua has agreed to pay qintex 
18 million if it accepts another offer 
mgmuas most attractive assets are its film libraries united 
artists has nearly 1000 films including rain man 
betrayed the living daylights baby boom and the 
rocky pictures foreign home video distribution rights to the 
3000film mgm library are also up for grabs cable tv magnate ted 
turner already owns the other rights to those movies 
the libraries throw off 90 to 100 million a year in cash 
flow said andrew wallach an analyst who follows mgmua for 
drexel burnham lambert if youre paying 14 billion for it 
thats about 14 times operating cash flow aside from any other 
assets 
he said that would make mgmua an attractive target for an 
aggressive bidder such as murdoch who needs programming for his fox 
tv network here and for his british sky channel the fourchannel 
satellite service into which he already has sunk 120 million in its 
first five months 
the australianborn murdoch now a us citizen is just one of 
many entertainment industry giants actively acquiring programming 
for the booming overseas market 
the programming demand will be fueled by the coming deregulation 
of european television and new satellite technologies overseas 
audiences have demonstrated such an insatiable taste for us films 
and tv shows that european regulators are considering limiting how 
many american productions can be shown after 1992 when european 
trade barriers come down 
according to proxy material mailed to mgmua shareholders 
recently qintex and fox were the final two suitors of a host of 
companies that expressed interest in mgmua after it acknowledged in 
april 1988 that it had received sale inquiries 
other companies that have been mentioned as being interested in 
all or part of mgmua include sony corp the walt disney co mca 
inc polygram nv the cannon group weintraub entertainment group 
former and present mgmua directors alan ladd jr and david gerber 
qintex australia owns 43 percent of qintex entertainment inc a 
tv company that financed part of the cbs miniseries lonesome 
dove and bills itself as australias largest tv production and 
distribution company 
the qintex deal in essence would split mgmua leaving mgm under 
the control of los angeles billionaire kirk kerkorian who owns 82 
percent of mgmuas common stock and all but a tiny fraction of the 
preferred stock by the time kerkorian bought back the mgm 
businesses qintex would have paid about 600 million for united 
artists plus assumed 400 million in debt

an aide to us commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
denied wednesday that the white house had reprimanded mosbacher for 
his plan to promote a us highdefinition television industry 
earlier a congressional source in washington said the white 
house branded mosbacher a renegade promoting industrial policy 
with his plan to loosen tax and antitrust laws to boost the 
competitiveness of us industry in the development of 
highdefinition television or hdtv the source spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
wayne l berman counsellor to mosbacher attributed the report 
to anonymous midgets in the seat of the mighty in the white house 
commenting on matters to which they were clearly not a party 
berman accompanying mosbacher on a 15day visit to asia and 
eastern europe said the report of the reprimand was based on 
wholly incorrect information 
he said that in many months of meetings with various government 
agencies the commerce departments plan to deal with hdtv has been 
broadened 
it took us some time to evolve our thinking but we decided we 
dont want to single out hdtv for special treatment berman said 
it will be part of a larger policy to make our high technology 
competitive 
also wednesday mosbacher told japanese and foreign reporters at 
a luncheon that the flow of hdtv technology from japan the pioneer 
in the field to the united states would be welcome 
we dont believe its the governments position to take the 
lead in this kind of development but this could be a good example 
of building a basis for some technology from japan to the united 
states mosbacher said 
japans public broadcasting organization nhk said wednesday it 
will sell some of its hdtv technology to texas instruments inc so 
the us company can design chips for advanced televisions 
the congressional source had said the white house reined in 
mosbacher for talking in terms reminiscent of the industrial 
policy program that democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis advocated in the 1988 campaign 
the wall street journal last month quoted sources who said 
mosbachers hdtv initiative was soundly criticized by other 
government agencies and was near death 
advocates of hdtv which promises motionpicture clarity and 
compact discquality sound say it could revitalize a lifeless us 
consumer electronics industry and have important applications in 
medicine defense and other industries
