lawmakers who have been tied up by the 
impeachment trials of three federal judges in as many years are 
calling for a change in the constitution to hand such trials to the 
supreme court 
sen wyche fowler dga chairman of the 12member trial 
committee that heard the case of us district judge walter nixon 
earlier this month said friday that he would propose a 
constitutional amendment to relieve congress of its impeachment 
duties 
they ought to be the ultimate triers of fact fowler said of 
the supreme court justices 
they are the most qualified they have the constitutional 
perspective on both the protections and sensitivity of federal 
judgeships he said 
he said the justices also have more time for the lengthy process 
required to remove judges from the federal bench 
the amendment would pertain only to the federal judiciary 
leaving the trial of other public officials impeached by the house 
to the senate said fowler who said he would sponsor the proposal 
with sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
an impeachment voted by the house serves as an indictment for 
trial before the senate a twothirds vote of the senate is required 
to then remove an official from office and disqualify the person 
from holding other federal office 
there only have been 15 impeachments by the house sent to the 
senate for trial in the 200year history of the congress but three 
of them have been in the last three years and all of the last three 
were federal judges 
fowler said he spent all of august studying the nixon case prior 
to the fourday trial before his special 12member committee earlier 
this month the full senate is expected to take no less than two 
days to hear the case debate and vote 
senate hearings in the impeachment case against us district 
judge alcee hastings of florida took four weeks last summer and are 
awaiting action by the full senate 
the impeachment and trial of us district judge harry claiborne 
in 1986 took the committee 10 days to hear and the full senate 18 
hours to consider before voting to remove claiborne from office 
according to sen bob dole rkan who was majority leader at the 
time the senate floor proceedings took more time than all but a 
handful of major issues before the 98th congress 
under the constitution the federal judges are appointed for life 
and can be removed from office only by voluntary resignation death 
or trial by congress 
fowlers plan for a constitutional amendment is not the first 
call for a change in the discipline of federal judges 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on courts intellectual property and the administration 
of justice has proposed strengthening federal laws governing the 
judges and setting up a commission to study the impeachment process

president bush says it doesnt really matter 
that a drug dealer was coaxed into selling crack cocaine near the 
white house just so the president could tell the american people 
thats where the sale took place 
the man went there and sold drugs in front of the white house 
didnt he the president told reporters in maine on friday 
thats the bottom line thats what the man did 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater and the drug 
enforcement administration concede the drug dealer was maneuvered 
into making a previously arranged sale in lafayette park across the 
street from the white house 
the president displayed the cocaine in a seethrough plastic bag 
in his nationally televised drug strategy speech on sept 5 he told 
the audience the crack had been seized a few days ago in a park 
across the street from the white house 
a democratic senator from louisiana john breaux criticized the 
presidents use of the prop as staged 
is this really a drug war or is this theatrics and 
screenplay he asked we dont need the president to lure drug 
pushers to lafayette park for photo opportunities 
and a reporter suggested to the president that the transaction 
wouldnt have taken place in the park had the cocaine not been 
needed for the speech 
the message i get out of it is a man was busted in front of 
the white house and i cannot feel sorry for him bush said he 
ought not to be out peddling these insidious drugs its ruining the 
children of this country 
the president said hed asked for a drug sample from that 
vicinity to show it can happen anywhere and thats what they 
gave me and they told me where they caught this guy 
bush spoke as if the suspected dealer a teenager had been 
arrested although the transaction with an undercover dea agent was 
photographed the dealer was not taken into custody agents said 
because they hoped he would sell a larger amount later and identify 
his organization 
a planned arrest earlier this week fell through when the suspect 
did not show up and agents hope to obtain indictments against him 
asked if the american people were manipulated into thinking drugs 
were being sold near the white house bush replied what do you 
mean it didnt really happen the guy was arrested or grabbed for 
selling drugs in front of the white house it didnt exist it 
didnt happen 
on every drug bust bush said you bring somebody someplace 
bush became irritated with reporters questions gesturing toward 
the press at one point and saying i dont understand are these 
advocates here for this drug guy 
but while bush and fitzwater defended the arrangement another 
senior white house official suggested the drug enforcement 
administration had been a little overzealous 
we told them that if a buy could be made near the white house 
so much the better they took us literally said the official 
asking not to be identified

rep barney frank is offering an apology to 
political supporters and assuring them that my judgment has 
improved since his involvement with a male prostitute 
i made some serious mistakes in judgment several years ago 
what i did was wrong the massachusetts democrat said in a letter 
mailed friday to homestate supporters and volunteers in his 
previous campaigns for congress 
it did not affect my public decisions or any public business 
frank wrote but i regret that some of my past personal actions 
are troubling to people who placed their confidence in me 
frank also drew some republican support friday for his decision 
not to resign while awaiting an inquiry by the house ethics 
committee into his 18month relationship with stephen l gobie 
he deserves a fair hearing said rep newt gingrich of 
georgia the house republican whip 
gingrich who is under investigation by the ethics committee over 
his personal finances in a book deal told reporters it was 
appropriate for frank to await the panels findings 
frank is a fiveterm congressman and outspoken liberal who was 
reelected overwhelmingly in 1988 after disclosing the year before 
that he is homosexual 
gobie has charged he operated a prostitution ring out of franks 
capitol hill apartment frank has acknowledged paying gobie for sex 
and then hiring him as a personal assistant and driver but says he 
threw gobie out when he learned of the prostitution operation that 
was shortly before frank publicly disclosed he is homosexual 
frank in his letter said the pressure of hiding his 
homosexuality while maintaining a political life led him to deal 
with the prostitute 
dealing with being gay while continuing to meet my public 
obligations created tremendous internal pressures frank wrote 
those pressures ended when i spoke publicly about my own personal 
identity not coincidentally my judgment has improved since then 
frank said that as a result of being in public life i cannot 
be surprised that my mistakes in personal judgment of several years 
ago have now become public knowledge but he said that some 
highly sensationalized stories about the matter have included 
substantial untruths 
it was to end any question about what is the truth that i asked 
the ethics committee of the united states congress to consider this 
entire matter he wrote i need hardly tell you that this 
committee will have my full cooperation meanwhile i hope you will 
accept my apology 
aides to frank said the letter was widely distributed to veteran 
supporters and was not mailed at government expense

president bushs choice to lead the national 
endowment for the arts says a measure by sen jesse helms to stop 
federal funding of sexually explicit or blasphemous art would 
cripple the governments role in promoting artistic excellence 
making unfettered artistic judgments would be most difficult 
under the helms amendment john e frohnmayer told a senate 
committee considering his nomination 
i think we need freedom and tolerance for art to 
flourish the portland ore lawyer told the senate labor and 
human resources committee on friday 
the arts agency is at the center of a political storm resulting 
from the use of federal money in exhibits that included works by 
artists robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano mapplethorpes 
photographs depict explicit homosexual acts and serrano displayed a 
work showing a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine 
the senate in july adopted an amendment by helms rnc that 
would prohibit the agency from using any of its 170 million in 
annual appropriations to promote distribute or produce obscene 
and indecent materials or art that denigrates the beliefs of any 
religion 
the house voted against helms measure 264153 last week after 
endowment defenders complained it would establish a broad pattern of 
censorship that would destroy the agencys credibility in the arts 
community 
the endowment uses panels of experts to award subsidies each year 
to artists 
i do not believe in funding obscene art frohnmayer said 
but he added i would certainly hate to see the whole structure 
change because of some grants which are controversial 
a onetime divinity student with a graduate degree in christian 
ethics from the university of chicago frohnmayer encountered no 
opposition to his confirmation from members of the senate committee 
if approved by the full senate he would replace hugh southern 
who has been named general manager of the new york metropolitan 
opera

a federal advisory committee says the worlds 
leading sleep medication halcion may put users at greater risk of 
temporary amnesia than other drugs of its kind 
the food and drug administration panel recommended friday that 
the warning be added to halcions label and that stronger warnings 
be given to consumers and doctors about all possible side effects 
for this drug and other sedativehypnotics which are sold only by 
prescription 
the psychopharmacological drugs advisory committee asked the fda 
to work out the language of the warnings paul leber director of 
the fdas division of neuropharmacological drug products said it 
would be at least six months before the agency would complete work 
on the warnings 
theres no sense of urgency on this he said 
godfrey grant a spokesman for the upjohn co which makes 
halcion said the committees review should put to rest many 
concerns that have been raised about the drug 
the recommendations resulted from the committees review of a 
relatively high number of reports about side effects associated 
with the use of halcion compared with other sedativehypnotics 
these included amnesia anxiety aggression and hallucinations all 
of which are included in the warning label for halcion 
panel members said the high number of reactions reported may be 
overstated since incomplete data on incidents was collected and it 
can be used only as a broad indicator 
given the limitations of the information we did not sense 
there was a special problem of side effects with halcion said dr 
daniel e casey panel chairman and chief of psychiatric research 
and psychopharmacology at the veterans administration medical center 
in portland ore 
halcion was approved for sale in the united states in 1983 and 
about 43 million prescriptions of the drug have been written since 
then the fda has received 1693 reports of adverse side effects 
possibly associated with its use ranging from amnesia to death 
said charles anello deputy director of the fdas office of 
epidemiology and biostatistics 
by comparison 35 million prescriptions have been written for 
restoril a sedativehypnotic made by sandoz pharmaceuticals corp 
since 1981 and the fda has received 266 reports of unwanted side 
effects he said 
officials of the upjohn co which makes halcion said the 
greater number of halcion reports could be the result of a number of 
things including media reports about the drug these include 
reports about a utah woman shot her mother last year after taking 
halcion charges against the woman were dismissed 
upjohn spokesman grant said the company was pleased the 
advisory committee has essentially come to the conclusion that there 
are few if any concerns that need to be addressed 
besides agreeing to recommend relabeling for halcion for 
temporary amnesia the panel decided to address concerns for the 
entire class of sleeping pills three drugs are included in this 
class halcion restoril and dalmane 
panel members asked the fda to provide material to consumers to 
alert them to the possibility of side effects of the drugs so the 
consumers could discuss them with their doctors 
committee members said they were concerned about travelers 
amnesia a temporary syndrome that can affect travelers who take 
one of the drugs they can function normally after awakening but 
later wont recall their activities during this period such as 
going through customs at the airport 
the labels for these drugs already warn of amnesia as a possible 
side effect but the committee recommended the fda consider adding 
travelers amnesia to the labels

the copilot of the usair jet that crashed into 
the east river killing two people inadvertently pushed a button 
that caused the 737400 to decelerate federal officials said friday 
after interviewing the cockpit crew 
the pilot tried to increase the throttle manually the plane 
began to veer to the left and the pilot feeling a vibration 
aborted the takeoff said james kohlstad acting administrator of 
the national transportation safety board 
kohlstad did not specify a precise cause for wednesdays 1129 
pm crash when flight 5050 bound for charlotte nc skidded off 
the runway into the waters off laguardia airport 
he initiated the abort because of the drift kohlstad said 
kohlstad said the plane has automatic throttles that are 
programmed prior to takeoff by the flight crew 
the button that the copilot constantine kleissaf 29 should 
have pushed would have automatically accelerated the plane to a 
preset speed for takeoff he said 
but kleissaf inadvertently hit the disengage button he said as 
the plane continued down the runway pilot michael martin 36 
jumped in to try to increase the throttle manually 
the plane started drifting to the left and the pilot felt and 
heard a vibration which concerned him kohlstad said a senior 
flight attendant and a passenger also reported feeling the 
vibration he said 
as the plane accelerated down the runway kohlstad said the 
flight crew did not call out the jets speed to each other as is 
mandatory 
it was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in the 
cockpit kohlstad said 
the copilot meanwhile told investigators he was looking out 
the front window when he realized the captain was going to abort the 
flight kohlstad said 
the pilot referring to an earlier flight that day told 
officials the copilots performance suggested that he was 
obviously new kohlstad said 
kohlstad said it was the copilots first operational takeoff on 
a 737400 following completion of flight training 
after the crash the pilot and copilot helped passengers get out 
of the plane kohlstad said 
the pilot took a rescue boat to the airport and then a taxi to 
the marriott hotel where he called his union representative he 
said 
the federal aviation administration earlier friday suspended the 
flight licenses of the pilot and copilot because both men left the 
scene after the accident and could not be questioned by 
investigators said faa administrator james b busey 
for these two pilots to have been sequestered for more than 36 
hours after an accident that took two lives and to do so with no 
explanation is highly questionable busey said in a statement 
issued in washington there are many questions that only they can 
answer relating to public safety 
both men may appeal the suspension but would need to go through a 
recertification procedure to get their licenses back 
interviews with the flight crew indicated that the pilot was 
not exhibiting any abnormal behavior before the takeoff kohlstad 
said at a news conference friday evening 
kohlstad said the copilot kleissaf apologized for having said 
the pilot martin was incoherent before the takeoff 
kleissaf had reportedly said martin had been acting irrationally 
just before he ordered the planes takeoff aborted i regret that 
i put that in those words kohlstad said kleissaf told the 
investigators 
both men have submitted to urine tests but the results were not 
yet available kohlstad said 
kohlstad said martin and kleissaf were not required to remain at 
the accident scene they had gone through a very traumatic 
experience he said they had helped the passengers they wanted 
to leave the scene 
martins whereabouts were unknown the day after the crash but 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said that was not unusual in plane 
crash investigations 
kohlstad said both pilots went to a hospital for treatment 
thursday which he said partially explains their absence i dont 
feel theyve hampered the investigation he said it is 
difficult for me to say they were stonewalling us 
investigators arranged thursday through the pilots union and the 
airline to interview the pilots who had been subpoenaed by the faa 
but appeared before investigators voluntarily authorities said 
the senior flight attendant on the plane at an emotional news 
conference with three of his coworkers from flight 5050 said both 
pilots assisted in rescue efforts after the crash 
but the attendant wayne reed 34 of chesapeake va refused to 
comment on the captains behavior except to say he was assisting 
me in any way he could 
also friday the air line pilots association issued a statement 
in response to what it called a number of erroneous news reports 
and inappropriate speculations about the crash and martins 
alleged irrational behavior 
there was nothing unusual in the crews performance no federal 
rules were broken and the crew has cooperated completely with the 
investigation the pilots union said 
alpa also denied that martin disappeared after the crash a usair 
representative contacted martin after the crash and told him to 
check into a marriott hotel and stay there the union said 
when he was unable to obtain a room at the marriott he went to 
the home of another pilot to rest and recuperate the unions 
statement said there he remained in contact with the company 
which knew his whereabouts at all times 
usair spokesman dave shipley denied that martin had been in 
contact with any airline official he did not contact us and we 
did not tell him to go to the hotel shipley said 
in another effort to determine what caused the crash 
investigators began removing pieces of the plane from the east river 
on friday morning said port authority spokesman john hughes the 
1129 pm crash wednesday cracked the plane into three pieces 
which were partly submerged 
the new york times reported that according to airline industry 
officials the captain had flown 737s for only two months and the 
first officer was in a 737 cockpit crew for the first time 
faa records show kleissaf received his commercial pilots license 
in october 1987 and an instructors license six months later his 
faa record is completely clean said faa spokesman bob hoppers in 
oklahoma city okla 
killed in the crash were passengers betsy brogan 37 of gray 
tenn a nurse and mother of a 5yearold boy and her 
motherinlaw alyce brogan 69 of vixton va the deaths were 
usairs first in 17 years 
the plane was delivered in january and had no history of 
mechanical problems said airline spokeswoman nancy vaughan 
in june the faa ordered most boeing 737400s grounded because of 
two incidents in which engines failed airlines were ordered to 
replace certain engine parts

association found the sign offensive but said it has to go 
if the sign was somewhere else on another front door hidden 
from view it wouldnt matter but her door is very close to the 
condos meeting room a lot of people have to pass by her door and 
its offensive to everyone he said 
jacobs has sent a letter telling ms reiter the condo association 
would remove the sign if she does not he said she was in violation 
of a condo regulation that prohibits residents from decorating their 
front doors 
ms reiter said she has called a lawyer and is ready to go to 
court 
if they pull down that sign there will be trouble she said

a cable television company is asking its 
cinemax subscribers whether they want the cable company to blackout 
the scheduled showing next month of the movie the last temptation 
of christ 
when the movie was released last year many fundamentalist 
religious groups objected with mass demonstrations and picketing of 
theaters where it was shown in north dakota the movie was only 
shown in fargo 
because of that controversy bismarckmandan cable tv sent its 
1800 cinemax subscribers a letter saying it is considering blacking 
out the five showings of the film in october 
the company also sent subscribers a card with two boxes to check 
a box in favor of the blackout and a box against it 
as we examined it we said it looks like a nowin situation 
said jay o jot turner manager of the cable company if we 
aired the movie there will probably be a lot of protests like last 
year in the theaters and if we censor the movie or blackout there 
would be a lot of protests from people saying you shouldnt do 
that 
turner said he will have an announce the results of the balloting 
on wednesday 
a spokesman for home box office parent company of cinemax who 
asked not to be identified said he didnt want to comment on the 
movie but said the companys general policy is that hbo and cinemax 
have the final say over programming local cable operators do not 
have the right to blackout the movies he said 
turner said bismarckmandan cable tvs contract allows it we 
do have a clause in there which says that we can make a decision if 
theres some programming we feel is not proper to community 
standards we would have the right to black it out he said 
turner said that clause is used only as a last resort and added 
the cable company has never exercised that option

division of workers compensation has sued the justice department 
for release of the fbis file on her father no trial date has been

although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20 col 
john ware principal director of music said the slain bandsmen all 
were trained adult musicians they held military ranks but none had 
been trained as a fighting soldier 
the outlawed irish republican army engaged in a 20yearold 
campaign to drive the british from the province of northern ireland 
claimed responsibility in a telephone call to ireland international 
a dublin news agency 
residents of the area adjoining the marines school said friday 
that despite government calls for steppedup public alertness 
against terrorists security at the school had eased noticeably 
anyone in deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the 
base said fred verge a 70yearold army veteran 
local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance 
to the barracks 
there is a great sense of anger in the community kent police 
chief constable paul condon said 
the royal marines music school is one of 30 military 
establishments in britain that use private security firms defense 
ministry figures show 
unidentified defense sources quoted by the times newspaper today 
said the civilian guards were backed up by armed marines who 
patrolled regularly inside the perimeter 
defense secretary tom king promised a security review and said 
new measures had already been taken at the base he did not 
elaborate 
martin oneill the opposition labor partys spokesman on 
defense said on friday serious questions must be asked about the 
pennypinching policy of the ministry of defense which may well put 
our armed services at dreadful risk 
oneill later told british broadcasting corp television the ira 
was prepared to take out anybody the cowardly nature of their 
attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat 
he said private security firms were assigned to areas considered 
low risks for attacks 
if we designate places as being lowrisk categories then it is 
likely they will be attacked given the way that the ira is forced 
to operate oneill added 
the big prizes are no longer available to them so theyre 
picking off the ones which they regard vulnerable 
prime minister margaret thatcher received news of the bombing 
while aboard a jet over siberia en route from japan to moscow she 
called it a deeply serious outrage 
king visited the scene soon after the explosion 
i know that the people who committed it the godfathers who 
sent them actually know in their hearts that it is not going to 
make any difference that it is just killing for the sake of 
killing he said 
the defense minister anger clearly written on his face said 
that rather than erode the will of the security forces the attack 
redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot 
win 
prime minister charles haughey of ireland condemned the attack 
and sent mrs thatcher a message of sympathy at this outrage 
which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries 
the mainly roman catholic ira claim gave no details of the 
operation but said it was a response to a message of war 
delivered by mrs thatcher when she visited northern ireland nine 
days ago 
it was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally 
recruited ulster defense regiment as a very very brave group of 
men who have lost 179 members in ira attacks since 1970 
the mainly protestant udr is regarded by many catholics as a 
sectarian force and is at present under a cloud over allegations 
that some recruits leaked names addresses and photos of ira 
suspects to protestant assassins 
british military installations are a frequent target of the ira 
campaign fridays attack was the worst since july 1982 when 11 
servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central london

marines bands up to 250 young men most ages 16 to 20 undergo

president bushs war on drugs is caught in a 
partisan battle in the senate with democrats trying to add 
prevention and treatment money and republicans arguing the revision 
would weaken the defense budget 
if were not willing to spend 150 million more this is no 
war sen daniel k inouye dhawaii said friday after a week of 
closeddoor efforts to reach a compromise failed 
the talks broke off friday and no new negotiations were scheduled 
republicans were proposing to add 850 million to the 79 
billion program bush announced two weeks ago and democrats were 
holding out for an additional 1 billion with no further talks 
scheduled 
the parties also were at odds over how to distribute cuts in 
programs for money to go to the antidrug effort 
the breakdown threatened to create a logjam of money bills in the 
senate just before the oct 1 start of the fiscal year when the 
funds ordinarily would be needed lawmakers said they might pass a 
stopgap measure to keep federal workers on the job and benefit 
checks flowing 
the chief republican negotiator sen mark o hatfield rore 
said the two sides were actually fairly close and said he hoped the 
parties would take a cleareyed monday morning view and resume 
bargaining 
we have to wage this war and the sooner we get at it the better 
its going to be hatfield said 
sen robert c byrd dwva the chief democratic negotiator 
said the white house had been a shadow participant in the 
negotiations and that its reluctance to compromise was the key 
problem 
there comes a time when you have to fish or cut bait said 
byrd the chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
republican lawmakers said they were frequently on the phone to 
white house chief of staff john sununu on thursday when a marathon 
bargaining session ended at midnight 
sununu was in the office of senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas friday morning for a strategy session with gop senators 
national drug policy director william bennett and budget director 
richard darman 
of the 1 billion democrats would add 800 million would be 
aimed at stemming demand for drugs through education and prevention 
programs and through treatment the rest would go to local law 
enforcement 
democrats would finance their program with an acrosstheboard 
cut of 03 percent in federal spending plus selected cuts to be 
determined by congressional subcommittees 
republicans were offering to add 850 million to the program 
including 750 million for the socalled demand side programs of 
treatment and prevention and the rest for local law enforcement 
they would get additional money through a 04 percent 
acrosstheboard cut in spending hatfield said but republicans 
were holding out for additional flexibility to protect defense 
procurement from the full brunt of acrosstheboard cuts 
since the bargaining began democrats cut their proposed increase 
by more than half to compromise with republicans gop senators said 
byrds initial plan with its acrosstheboard reduction of more 
than 05 percent would have been too hard on defense 
and inclusion of selected cuts also represented a partial 
concession to republican demands 
byrd told a news conference that republicans asked for 
concessions and we said ok well do that but lets beef up that 
treatment side that prevention side he and other democratic 
lawmakers dismissed the notion that their proposal would weaken 
defense 
the administration was unwilling to let a 300 billion defense 
budget bear a less than onehalf of one percent cut to beef up the 
war on drugs sen james sasser dtenn told reporters

gov bob martinez is seeking emergency 
rules to protect women at private abortion clinics in florida after 
ordering a miami clinic closed because of reports of botched 
abortions 
this is a pure prohealth issue martinez said at a friday 
news conference this is for the health of individuals 
irregardless of philosophy on the substance of the abortion issue 
martinez told health and rehabilitative services secretary greg 
coler to take all steps necessary to remove the license of this 
clinic 
the action comes after reports of improper abortions by 
unlicensed physicians resulting in ruptured uteri and hysterectomies 
at the dadeland medical center now doing business as the womens 
service center 
there is no legal reason no health reason for this order 
responded susan hoffman director of the center weve done 
nothing against the law weve helped thousands of women i see this 
as totally ludicrous 
peter dunbar the governors general counsel said any emergency 
regulations drawn up by hrs for abortion clinics would be in effect 
for 90 days after that the new rules would be subject to public 
hearings and hrs board approval to become permanent 
by that time the legislature will have decided whether to go 
along with martinezs proposals to further restrict access to 
abortions the session is scheduled for oct 1013 
martinez has denied he was trying to bypass the legislature by 
using the miami situation to enact emergency regulations 
yet in his letter to coler the governor said conditions at the 
miami clinic are precisely why i have called for increased 
regulation of abortion clinics to protect the health of women 
the new rules martinez said will not be as strict as his 
proposal for the special session to make private abortion clinics 
adhere to the same standards as ambulatory care clinics 
martinez said hrs should not be blamed for the problems at the 
miami clinic saying the agency doesnt have the power at present to 
uncover them he said he doesnt know whether abortion clinics 
throughout the state have similar practices 
brian ballard the governors chief of operations said 
veterinary clinics have more stringent regulations than abortion 
centers 
neither martinez nor dunbar would be specific about the kinds of 
regulations being sought but both said they would be designed to 
protect the health of women seeking abortions not to restrict 
their access to an abortion

irving berlin created the american popular song 
until berlin began writing after the turn of the century 
american music was dominated by europe english music hall gilbert 
and sullivan viennese operetta and italian opera berlin took 
native american sounds such as ragtime and turned them into huge 
popular hits like alexanders ragtime band and everybodys 
doin it now when irving berlin wrote america listened for 
more than 50 years 
he caught the voices of the people early in this century and 
held them for longer than anyone else robert kimball musical 
theater historian said friday 
from his first song marie of sunny italy in 1907 to his 
last broadway show mr president in 1962 berlins presence 
was felt on the music scene in this country no one today can look 
to such a long period of domination 
and berlin was a winner in every medium he tried he found 
success not only in tin pan alley but on broadway with musicals like 
annie get your gun call me madam and his music box revues 
and in hollywood where he wrote the scores for fred astaireginger 
rogers movies like top hat and follow the fleet and other 
films like holiday inn and easter parade 
his colleagues thought he was the best particularly 
contemporaries like jerome kern he had an enormous influence on the 
broadway composers who followed him especially george gershwin and 
harold arlen who relished his inventive way with rhythm 
berlin also had an incredible versatility a great intelligence 
and perspective about the world he could write any kind of song a 
stirring patriotic anthem like god bless america a seasonal 
standard like white christmas a comic theater ditty like 
doin what comes naturlly an unbashedly sentimental favorite 
like always or a complex love song like lets face the music 
and dance 
he was a folk singer and he was able to absorb whatever was 
happening in the street and bring it out even more than stephen 
foster said edward jablonski a good friend of berlins and the 
author of several books on american theater composers he was an 
ordinary man who was able to write songs thats why he appealed so 
much to people 
but he also made a point of not being a welleducated musician 
he was a born musician which is a hard thing to be so he could be 
more sophisticated that he ever thought he was 
berlin also was a shrewd businessman he was a charter member and 
served on the first board of directors for ascap the american 
society of composers authors and publishers which collects 
songwriting royalties before 1920 he had formed his own music 
publishing company which published all of his music and at the time 
of his death he was still coowner of the music box theater a 
broadway theater he built in 1921 as late as two years ago he 
would call up the box office at the music box to see how the grosses 
were going 
but it will be for his music that he will be remembered 
i would think irving berlin is the most admired songwriter 
america has produced in this century and maybe ever kimball

decked out in berets flak jackets and camouflage pants sat around 
the pool of the sahara hotel amid bikiniclad sunbathers others 
rubbed shoulders with civilian gamblers at the bars and slot 
machines 
an estimated 10000 delegates could choose from seminars on such 
hot spots as central america and afghanistan manufacturers 
displays and a shooting competition at a desert range 
as usual the big hit was the annual display of weapons and 
apparel designed especially for those spoiling for a fight

you to play with when you were growing up said bill brooks 
exhibition director at the convention which is put on by soldier of 
fortune magazine of boulder colo

for them 
yarborough said his company sells only to licensed gun dealers

us and soviet negotiators meeting 
under the splendor of the snowcapped rocky mountains reached a 
major breakthrough friday on a treaty to slash longrange nuclear 
weapons arsenals 
they also neared completion of a separate accord that would open 
soviet underground nuclear tests to onsite american inspection and 
vice versa senior us and soviet officials reported a soviet 
official said a general framework for a pact had been nailed 
down which if made final could end a deadlock on the ratification 
of 15yearold test ban treaties 
the breakthrough on strategic weapons came during an arms control 
session between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a mountain lodge overlooking 
jackson lake 
there shevardnadze informed baker the soviets had dropped their 
demand for completion of a treaty to limit spacebased defenses 
star wars before a separate pact to slash longrange bombers 
missiles and nuclear submarines could be implemented 
i am not aware of any statement like that in the past said a 
us official who demanded anonymity 
the soviets have shifted he said 
since the united states refused to yield to soviet demands to 
trim its spacedefense program known popularly as star wars 
completing a treaty to reduce strategic weapons 30 to 50 percent was 
improbable 
former president ronald reagans summit meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in iceland in 1987 fell apart over the 
dispute which is known within the arms control community as 
linkage 
the shift in soviet position was announced this way by the senior 
us official at a briefing for reporters 
in response to a question from secretary baker mr 
shevardnadze said they had dropped their linkage between completing 
an agreement in start strategic arms reduction talks and achieving 
a defenseinspace accord 
the us official repeated the statement thrice for emphasis he 
stressed a treaty to slash strategic weapons could be implemented 
even without an agreement on us and soviet defenses 
this looks like a positive development the official said 
he stressed president bush intended to go ahead with the us 
strategic defense initiative launched by reagan 
the presidents commitment to that program is very 
wellknown the official said 
reagan announced the program in march 1983 from the outset the 
soviets sought to stifle it 
but since 1987 the soviets had said they were willing to permit 
some star wars tests the offer is under discussion at the talks in 
jackson hole 
a soviet spokesman boris malakhov said there would be no soviet 
response to the american comments before shevardnadze spoke at a 
joint news conference today 
in another development the washington post said in saturday 
editions that the letter carried to president bush by shevardnadze 
from soviet president mikhail gorbachev called for an acceleration 
of meetings of foreign ministers aimed at a treaty on conventional 
arms in europe by the end of next year 
the inspection agreement would send scores of american inspectors 
to the soviet test site at semipalatinsk to ensure that detonations 
that are part of the soviet nuclear weapons program are within legal 
limits it would also bring soviet inspectors to the us test site 
in nevada 
scientists from both countries have monitored some of each 
others recent explosions as a test 
the current ceiling under unratified 1974 and 1976 treaties is a 
force of 150 kilotons or 150000 tons of tnt the bomb that 
destroyed hiroshima in 1945 exploded with a force now estimated at 
about 13000 tons of tnt 
the soviet official who briefed reporters on the daylong 
bakershevardnadze talks on condition that he not be identified 
said that the two sides still had to decide the range of the small 
blasts that could be excluded from inspection the us position is 
to have all tests between 50 and 150 kilotons subject to inspection 
while the soviets wanted to set the range between 75 and 150 
kilotons 
there would be no bar to underground explosions smaller than 
whatever floor is decided upon 
tests in the atmosphere and in the ocean are banned by a 1963 
treaty 
the new agreement could pave the way for senate ratification of 
the 1974 and 1976 treaties which critics had contended did not 
contain adequate safeguards against violations in fact former 
president ronald reagan accused the soviets in two reports to 
congress of cheating charges the soviets flatly denied 
the agreement clears the way for american use of a new 
sophisticated technique that measures the speed of destruction of a 
coaxial cable in a vertical hole near the blast the socalled 
corrtex technique 
until now measurements have been undertaken with seismic 
methods measuring the ground motion resulting from the blast just 
like measurements of earthquakes 
the soviet official said the agreement gives the two sides the 
option on which method to use and his government still prefers the 
seismic approach 
the general framework has been agreed on the soviet official 
said 
the other two tentative accords announced during the lunch 
break provides for advance notice of military exercises and an 
agreement in principle for trial verification of each others 
stockpiles of longrange nuclear weapons according to the soviet 
briefer 
some of those arms such as cruise missiles carried aboard 
submarines and surface warships are hard to track this has slowed 
completion of a treaty to slash stockpiles of bombers missiles and 
submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
the soviet official said there were still differences over which 
weapons to expose to inspection he said the united states was 
concentrating on soviet mobile missiles while the soviets wanted to 
check on a broader range of arms and factories 
still the headway on arms control reflected a generally good 
atmosphere 
not all went smoothly though one us official who also 
requested anonymity said baker had complained to shevardnadze about 
tremendous increases in soviet bloc weapons shipments to 
nicaragua and cambodia 
posing for pictures at the start of two days of talks baker and 
shevardnadze looked over a meadow with the snowdusted grand teton 
mountains just beyond 
two moose grazed in the sunlit flats at the base of the peaks 
baker joked that the animals had been chained to provide a 
bucolic backdrop 
yes i notice that the moose are tied the soviet minister 
replied after the two men left the terrace the moose bolted into 
the woods at the approach of television cameramen 
baker meeting with shevardnadze in a lakeside lodge said he 
hoped a new openness between the superpowers would lead to some 
steps that are unprecedented the nuclear test agreement would 
fall into that category 
shevardnadze shared in bakers upbeat mood as the two spoke 
briefly to reporters 
i would like especially to emphasize he said that it is 
high time for us to move from mutual understanding to mutual 
action 
baker and shevardnadze are scheduled to meet through sunday 
morning when after a fishing expedition they will fly on an air 
force jet to new york to attend the un general assembly which 
opens on monday with a speech by president bush 
shevardnadze addresses the assembly on tuesday 
the talks here were also designed to narrow a time frame for 
bushs first summit meeting with gorbachev sometime next year 
shevardnadze asked to comment on bush administration statements 
that a summit would be held sometime next year said well be 
discussing this today

hurricane hugos sixhour blast left 
folly beach unrecognizable even to its mayor up the coast the 
storms wake left two other barrier islands cut off and sliced 
another in two 
folly beach the town and island just south of charleston 
virtually lost its entire beachfront row of homes 
i dont know where we are mayor bob linville said during a 
tour of the area all of my usual landmarks are gone 
one missing dwelling was the atlantic house restaurant which had 
survived years of serious erosion that left it literally sitting 
atop pilings in the ocean approachable only by foot bridge after 
hugo all that remained was its red shingle roof 
about 30 percent of the houses on the island are no longer 
habitable if theyre even here said claude wade of the folly 
beach police department 
linville estimated the damage at tens of millions of dollars and 
said hundreds of buildings had been damaged or destroyed 
most of the seaward houses in the town of 2000 residents either 
were cracked open or without roofs or windows 
along the ocean support poles for beach houses had nothing to 
support their houses having been washed away by hugos 12 to 
17foot tidal surge arctic avenue about 50 feet from the ocean 
looked like a dirt road covered with sand and the debris of smashed 
beach houses 
the storm showed that the destruction was often a game of chance 
one house was knocked off its foundation and with a wall missing 
but a china cabinet remained standing as did two plates inside 
demolished houses spewed mattresses clothes and furniture along 
the beach 
the holiday inn which sits on a slab of concrete 50 feet from 
the ocean seemed to weather the storm remarkably well despite its 
proximity to the ocean its upper floors remained intact even though 
the first floor was demolished farther up the coast two barrier 
islands sullivans island and the isle of palms were cut off 
from land because the storm knocked out its only link the 
swingspan ben sawyer bridge 
on the isle of palms which hosts the us clay court tennis 
championships the hurricane ripped the fishing pier out of the 
water and destroyed milliondollar waterfront homes 
about 100 boats that had been docked at the wild dunes marina 
were stacked up like cordwood across the marina on goat island 
said ben moise a state wildlife and marine resources department 
official 
hugo created a 100 to 200footwide channel of water through 
pawleys island midway between charleston and myrtle beach 
according to jack sellers a pilot from columbia who flew people to 
the coast to check their property 
there are now two pawleys islands if you will sellers said 
back on folly beach dean dubani walked along the streets friday 
afternoon carrying a small satchel and looking for a ride 
while many other heeded evacaution orders before the storm 
dubani said he remained and partied with some other people in an 
ocean front house as hugo smashed ashore 
it was incredible he said everything was just floating 
by 
dubani said he left the house when it began breaking up and 
walked across the street to a neighbors house whose door had been 
blown open 
i got scared and just grabbed my clothes this is all i have 
left he said pointing to his pouch that contained a fishing 
pole a can of beer some swimming fins a snorkel several shirts 
and a few pairs of pants 
thinking about heading to key west he said before hitching a 
ride out of town with a blonde woman in a sports car 
but bud tetric was determined to stay 
going to rebuild he said of his demolished house i pay 
taxes and if i pay taxes i should have full use of my property

former housing secretary samuel pierce will 
exercise his right to ban cameras from his forced congressional 
testimony on scandals at the agency during his eightyear tenure 
pierces attorney on friday also gave his strongest indication 
yet that the former secretary might refuse to answer some questions 
when he appears before a house subcommittee tuesday but attorney 
paul l perito said no thought was being given to ignoring the 
subpoena 
thats not even in the realm of possibilities said perito 
well be there 
pierce was subpoenaed to testify after he refused to appear 
voluntarily last week house rules allow subpoenaed witnesses to ban 
television cameras still photographers and microphones from the 
hearing room 
pierces decision expressed in a letter from perito to the 
subcommittee is the latest maneuver in what has become an 
increasingly hostile interaction between the panel and pierce 
the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing is reviewing allegations of fraud mismanagement and 
cronyism at the department of housing and urban development it 
wants to ask pierce about a number of controversial decisions and 
testimony that contradicts a sworn account the former secretary gave 
in may 
chairman rep thomas lantos dcalif characterized pierce as 
deceitful after he declined to testify last week perito said 
pierce needed more time to prepare his testimony 
perito said he believed that televising the hearings has 
contributed to an atmosphere that totally departed from fairness 
and objectivity 
i am deeply committed to restoring decency and a sense of 
somberness in the process and frankly i want very much to decrease 
the atmosphere for what i consider unfounded but damaging references 
made about my client under the rubric of the free speech and debate 
clause perito said 
that clause provides that members of congress may not be sued for 
anything they say during official proceedings 
stuart weisberg the subcommittees chief counsel said lantos 
had expected the decision 
chairman lantos believes that it is not in the best interests 
of mr pierce and is a disservice to the american people who have a 
right to know what happened during mr pierces eightyear tenure at 
hud weisberg said 
lantos most likely will allow the use cameras and microphones at 
the conclusion of pierces testimony and offer a summation of the 
hearing weisberg said

key senate clean air sponsors say theyve 
reached a political compromise on acid rain that would benefit seven 
states that cleaned up emissions from coalfired power plants 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine and sen max 
baucus dmont on friday predicted their agreement would win 
support for clean air legislation the compromise is not included in 
president bushs clean air plan which is being considered by a 
house subcommittee 
both the administration and baucusmitchell plans are designed to 
reduce the major component of acid rain sulfur dioxide by 10 
million tons and prevent any growth of emissions after the 
reductions are achieved 
the bush bill would require the reduction by the end of the year 
2000 and the mitchellbaucus requires the improvement by jan 1 
2000 
the agreement would exempt states from making further sulfur 
dioxide reductions through the start of 2000 if more than one half 
of their coalfired power plants utilize pollutionreducing 
equipment called scrubbers 
the provision would benefit montana kansas minnesota north 
dakota new mexico utah and wyoming according to a list handed out 
by the senators 
acid rain is formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxide and is carried hundreds of miles before raining down 
to earth acid rain destroys aquatic life in lakes and streams 
damages trees in forests and can damage human lungs

some doctors and hospitals illegally deny 
lifesaving treatment to infants born with severe physical and mental 
disabilities says a government report 
decisions to withhold medical treatment food and fluids to these 
disabled children in many instances occur with the cooperation of 
federal state and local government agencies despite a federal law 
prohibiting the practice concluded the study released friday 
the 500page report medical discrimination against children 
with disabilities was released by the us commission on civil 
rights 
the studys conclusions are based on anecdotal evidence an 
examination of how hospital infantcare review committees and child 
protection agencies have enforced the law and a national random 
survey of physician attitudes published late last year 
in that survey 75 percent of the responding physicians said they 
would be neutral or would discourage surgery for infants with spina 
bifida and another severe disability hydrocephalus 
the study concludes that decisions to deny such treatment often 
are not made on the basis of medical judgments and are 
discriminatory

ravaged by two decades of war and bloody 
revolution cambodia now faces a drought that is expected to cut 
rice and fish cultivation by 25 percent and threaten many with 
starvation 
a lack of local government to provide social services or 
otherwise help people makes the prospects for this nation of 8 
million appear even bleaker 
if the war wont kill you then you might die because of no 
water said treang suon a 37yearold mother of four from veal 
village in the pursat province 90 miles northwest of phnom penh 
and there is no government to help us along 
interviews with peasants government officials teachers and 
western aid officials in the provinces of pursat and kampong chhnang 
gave a dark picture of the future for cambodia 
the country appears poised to slide into a new phase of civil 
conflict now that the vietnamese this nations occupiers for the 
last decade say they will withdraw the last of their troops by 
tuesday 
fighting between cambodian government troops and guerrillas from 
the khmer rouge resistance group already is intensifying in 
battambang 140 miles northwest of pursat a western doctor in 
pursat said his hospital has seen a twofold increase in gunshot 
wounds over the past two months 
now we average about five a day he said the khmer rouge 
are moving about very freely and the peasants are scared 
the economy too is in deep trouble 
fish cultivation and timber production have fallen in pursat for 
two straight years due to the late and light rains this year 
production of rice the staple crop for the whole country also is 
sure to fall 
three decades of peace ended in cambodia in 1970 when a military 
coup ousted prince norodom sihanouk dragging cambodia into the 
vietnam war the khmer rouge took power in 1975 and killed hundreds 
of thousands of people under their radical brand of agrarian 
communism 
vietnam invaded the country in december 1978 and installed a 
prohanoi regime in phnom penh a resistance coalition led by 
sihanouk has been battling the vietnamese and cambodian government 
troops 
if the economy worsens the government will lose legitimacy 
making its battle against the resistance front that much harder 
the biggest loser will be cambodias people 
time was when the moslem people of ro leap village took the 
halfday walk over palmlined paths and verdant paddies to lake 
tonle sap to fish the oncebountiful waters but now there is a 
drought and bands of khmer rouge guerrillas would make a trip too 
risky 
we buy our fish now and only eat it on special occasions 
said ty chouk a 37yearold farmer we used to fish everyday 
the catch in pursat province fell 41 percent between 1987 and 
1988 to 4120 metric tons according to khang heang vice chief of 
the provincial committee another drop in 1989 is expected 
government officials said 
they still fish in nearby veal village but the residents no 
longer wander into the forest near ro leap to cut hardwood timber 
and bamboo for their homes 
landmines laid by the government and the khmer rouge have blown 
up too many people 
the folks near the lake dont come up here anymore ty chouk 
said only we know where the government mines are because we laid 
them in the ground other villages are too scared to risk their 
lives even we dont go into the high areas anymore that belongs to 
the pol pot people and their mines 
timber cultivation also fell in pursat between 1987 and 1988 
dropping 16 percent to 5000 cubic meters khang heang said 
bad weather has been another problem scarce rain pushed rice 
planting back from may until august raising doubts as to whether 
the peasants around pursat would be able to plant a second crop of 
rice 
my family will go hungry this year said mrs suon spitting 
a red wad of beetlenut juice in the dirt we cant live only on 
coconuts and onions we must have rice 
another blow to agriculture has been the governments policy to 
forcibly conscript many young men 
san poen a 43yearold father of four had his two sons taken 
away by the military 
they were rounded up after a movie show he said it is 
good that they are serving the country but i need them too to farm 
the fields i had to drop some land this year and am farming less 
so we will have too little to eat 
khang heang estimated that rice cultivation in pursat would fall 
between 12 percent and 25 percent 
if the weather doesnt get better the people could starve he 
said 
a ministry of finance official said he believed nationwide 
production would probably fall 25 percent 
yet another problem is the lack of local administration to help 
people deal with the crisis 
at veal village which is responsible for eight communes holding 
about 1500 people the local government office consists of a 
ramshackle twostory house three rooms open onto a courtyard shaded 
by coconut trees freshly painted signs justice 
administration and economy hang from the rooms 
these are our departments says hem pheach a communist party 
official the rooms contain no chairs or tables there is no paper 
no phone in one room a chicken clucks in a corner searching for 
food 
we lack some materials hem says quietly then maybe we can 
get on with our job

thousands of caribbean 
residents remained at the mercy of the elements nearly a week after 
hurricane hugo destroyed their homes and communities 
officials in the virgin islands and in puerto rico complained 
friday that while washington readily flew in troops to stop the 
looting and restore order disaster relief was slow in coming 
tens of thousands of people remained in shelters or were roughing 
it wherever they could 
i think the governor was wrong in telling the people the 
military was coming without telling them when food was coming 
water was coming said territorial sen lilliana belardo de oneal 
interior secretary manuel lujan and a group of congressmen were 
to begin a twoday factfinding trip to puerto rico and the virgin 
islands today a congressional aide said the lawmakers planned to 
bring 20 cases of baby formula 30 chain saws and 2100 transistor 
radios 
the congressmen led by rep george miller dcalif also will 
consider special aid requests by local officials 
the us justice department obtained authority friday from virgin 
islands gov alexander farrelly to order fbi agents and deputy us 
marshals to enforce all laws on the islands and to prosecute any 
looters officials said 
officials say at least 27 people died when hugo steamrolled 
through guadeloupe montserrat antigua the british and us virgin 
islands and puerto rico on sunday before hitting the carolinas on 
thursday where it left 11 dead losses were estimated in the 
billions of dollars 
president bush on wednesday declared the virgin islands a 
disaster area and ordered 1200 troops mostly military police to 
st croix in part to stop widespread looting 
there were no reports of looting friday but virtually every 
store in christiansted the capital of st croix appeared to have 
been cleaned out 
the national guard has acknowledged that some of its members took 
part in the looting and several witnesses said some police also 
were involved 
lt gov derek hodge of the virgin islands said friday that hugo 
left homeless more than 45000 people about 90 percent of st 
croixs population st croix about 70 miles east of puerto rico 
is the main island in the group that includes st thomas and st 
john 
hodge said damage was tentatively estimated at 4 billion 
the island is almost a total disaster he said in a radio 
broadcast 
he appealed to the national guard the police and other public 
employees to return to work in full force despite the continued 
chaos on the island he said the national guard was operating at 40 
percent strength and the police at 80 percent 
ms belardo de oneal said she and four other senators met with 
gov alexander farrelly on friday to find out when people can expect 
relief supplies 
the st croix red cross vice chairman evelyn crittenden 
complained that the army failed to promptly fly in food clothes 
bedding and medicine 
here we are and this is what i have she said pointing to 
some old clothes piled on a table and the floor of an office 
hodge said federal disaster specialists arrived on st croix 
tuesday but were unable to request immediate help because of 
communications problems he said the virgin islands needs 
everything from wrenches to chain saws to medical supplies 
in puerto rico 70 percent of the islands 33 million residents 
remained without running water and 20000 were still housed in 
shelters large parts of san juan the capital and several towns in 
the northeast also remained without power officials said 
hundreds of residents in san juan stood in long lines waiting for 
water ice and gasoline 
when gov rafael hernandez colon arrived in the northern coastal 
town of canovanas on friday to inspect local shelters angry 
residents complained they had received no govenment aid since the 
storm 
were all in the street we dont have any food water or 
light our houses blew away resident gladys cruz told the 
governor 
in the british colony of montserrat gov christopher turner said 
30 percent of the homes will have to be rebuilt and another 30

the greenhouse effect may breed bigger and 
deadlier hurricanes in the future storms up to 50 percent stronger 
than hugo and last years recordsetting gilbert some 
meteorologists say 
hugo blasted the eastern caribbean and the carolinas with 135 mph 
winds this past week killing at least 41 people 
just before hugo struck the us coast its pressure was measured 
at 940 millibars that made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes 
this century to hit the united states the national hurricane 
centers miles lawrence said today 
gilbert whose winds reached 180 mph tore up the caribbean last 
year killing 300 and causing 2 billion damage it was the most 
powerful hurricane ever recorded 
gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with 
current ocean temperatures said kerry emanuel of the meteorology 
department at the massachusetts institute of technology 
but if the seas warm up say by 3 to 6 degrees fahrenheit the 
wind speeds might be 25 percent higher which means the destructive 
force would be more like 50 percent higher he said 
stephen schneider deputy director of the national center for 
atmospheric research in denver said his research suggests the 
warming trend is already here 
schneider an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new 
book global warming said six of the 10 hottest years in the 
last 100 occurred in the 1980s 
he projects that the 1990s will be even hotter 
hugo demonstrated the effect of warm atlantic waters when its 
winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the gulf 
stream before hitting the east coast schneider said 
youll get worse hurricanes if the caribbean is warmer he 
said and i think there are betterthaneven odds that you will 
have stronger hurricanes 
emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs moderate hurricanes 
of the future could grow to gilberts strength and future gilberts 
will be even stronger 
gilbert was so strong that bob sheets director of the national 
hurricane center said forecasters may have to use an intensity 
scale of 16 in the future instead of the current 15 with five 
the highest 
the computer models schneider uses show that in a worstcase 
scenario over the next 100 years the worlds temperature could jump 
by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas which both 
contribute to the greenhouse effect continue to pour into the 
atmosphere unchecked 
it is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up 
the caribbean could somehow remain cooler but he said that is 
unlikley 
thats not what the models are showing schneider said and 
thats another reason id like to slow down global warming

leaders of conservative political parties from 
around the world said today the failure of socialism is evident and 
that they will support east bloc reformers 
the disintegration and decay of socialism as an idea and as an 
economic and political system is one of the most important 
developments in our world today said a statement issued at the 
end of a threeday meeting of the international democrat union 
the union formed in 1983 includes rightofcenter parties from 
26 countries and holds a meeting of party leaders every two years 
figures who attended the conference in tokyo hosted by japanese 
prime minister toshiki kaifu included vice president dan quayle 
british prime minister margaret thatcher prime minister harri 
holkeri of finland and party leaders from countries in europe latin 
america the caribbean and the pacific region most of them in the 
opposition 
quayle whose speeches at the conference stressed the need to 
keep defenses strong and avoid complacency spent today touring us 
military bases in japan which is home to about 64000 us troops 
the vice president will hold meetings with kaifu and other 
japanese leaders monday and tuesday before flying to the philippines 
although delegates from austria on the frontier with the rapidly 
changing countries in eastern europe called for a program of 
comprehensive aid to east bloc reformers the final conference 
document did not go so far 
only the societies that free themselves totally of the 
structures rigidities and follies of socialism will in the longer 
run be able to share in the new prosperity of the future it said 
we therefore resolve to give support to all those who accept 
these challenges and who will embark upon a program of peaceful 
change towards freedom and democracy the statement said 
it said the west should not subsidize failed socialist economies 
and that increased debt would only hinder progress toward 
freemarket economies 
however the west must be prepared to give financial incentives 
which support real changes in these economies introducing market 
economy and other structural reforms it said 
the statement also called for more joint eastwest business 
ventures 
mrs thatcher at a news conference friday before she left for 
moscow and talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
she did not think the stage was set for something like the marshall 
plan the massive us aid program that helped western europe 
recover from world war ii 
but she said west european countries individually and in the 
european economic community had taken steps to aid poland and 
hungary and that she expected the international monetary fund and 
the world bank eventually to help 
andrew peacock head of the opposition liberal party of australia 
and new chairman of the organization of conservatives said the 
group was proposing programs to assist advocates of change in the 
east bloc 
while the conference statement praised gorbachevs reforms it 
said there was no guarantee he would succeed we therefore 
reaffirm our absolute determination to maintain adequate defenses 
and our continuing support for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence 
which has kept the peace in europe for over 40 years 
the statement noted however that some communist leaders have 
recognized a link between economic freedom and political freedom and 
said this showed a commitment to reform we are convinced that 
this new approach will diminish mistrust thus leading to marked 
improvement in eastwest relations it said

two chinese students seeking asylum 
testified that a return to their homeland would mean a life as bleak 
as their families endured during chinas cultural revolution 
the students who fled to san francisco after leading an 
antigovernment protest in tokyo following the june crackdown in 
beijing were emotional friday during the first day of their hearing 
asked through a cantonese translator if she would be willing to 
return to china hoy yu li replied i would rather die 
the 27yearold linguistics student testified about her fathers 
imprisonment during the cultural revolution and her own fears that 
her political activity while studying in japan would lead her to the 
same fate 
if we return its like a death row my life will be like my 
fathers and many others she said 
her fiance luo jian guang said when his father died last july 
he was afraid to return for the funeral 
i would never return to china because if i return to china 
they know my name they will imprison me he said 
the students were led handcuffed into the court but federal 
immigration judge bernard hornbach ordered the handcuffs removed 
immigration and naturalization service attorney beverly phillips 
said the ins had no particular position on the matter but filed a 
brief containing a state department recommendation that asylum not 
be granted because the students hadnt proved they face persecution 
if they return to china 
hoy and luo helped organize and publicize a rally in toyko on 
june 4 just after red army troops began their assault on student 
protesters in beijing they also signed a petition protesting the 
action 
immediately afterward they began receiving threatening phone 
calls warning them that their demonstration photographed by chinese 
embassy officials could lead them into trouble both testified 
friday that they believed the calls came from chinese authorities 
they fled through hong kong and have been seeking political 
asylum since arriving in san francisco in august their attorney 
eugene wong said there has been only one other case in which a 
chinese person came into the united states after the crackdown to 
seek asylum 
wong said the case could set a precedent for other chinese 
residents in the united states who have spoken out against the 
current regime in beijing 
the us government estimates there are 73000 chinese students 
in the country president bush decided in june to allow students who 
were in the country at the time of the beijing crackdown to remain 
here 
hornbach continued the hearing until sept 29 and advised wong to 
seek hoys release from custody so she could seek medical treatment 
for ulcerlike symptoms 
david ilchert regional ins director said hoy would be examined 
by a doctor today she was being held at a santa clara county 
womens detention facility

fighting between the government and 
guerrillas intensified as vietnams pullout deadline neared but 
thai officials said today the resistance and cambodian government 
had agreed to more peace talks 
vietnamese soldiers meanwhile received gifts and were serenaded 
at a farewell ceremony 
in bangkok thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan said that 
after meetings in the past two weeks cambodias three main 
guerrilla factions and premier hun sen agreed to future talks after 
negotiations failed in paris last month 
the time and place for the talks had yet to be fixed chatichai 
said at a news conference 
there was no immediate comment from the guerrillas or the 
cambodian government 
however chatichai said prince norodom sihanouk the leader of a 
coalition of guerrillas had suggested that the meeting be held in 
bangkok jakarta or paris 
we cannot let the cambodian fighting go on any longer if a 
civil war happens thailand will have to bear a greater burden of 
cambodian refugees he said 
already about 300000 refugees live along the cambodianthai 
border 
a soviet military adviser was quoted today as saying the 
cambodian government and khmer rouge guerrillas have thrown their 
best troops into heavy fighting for a gemrich town near the border 
the soviet adviser said khmer rouge troops succeeded in 
controlling the ridge and mountains around the city of pailin but 
that they had not taken the town located about 140 miles northwest 
of phnom penh and known for ruby mines in the area 
the adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said most of 
the towns residents had fled or been evacuated and that fighting 
was fierce his remarks made in russian in an interview with an 
east european reporter were made available to the associated press 
the adviser said cambodias 196th division apparently its best 
was fighting with the 302nd division of the khmer rouge a force 
formed in 1978 to serve as bodyguards for highranking khmer rouge 
leaders when tensions with vietnam were mounting 
sovietbacked vietnam has been supporting the communist 
government in pnom penh while china has backed the khmer rouge who 
governed from 1975 until 1978 and tried to carry out an agrarian 
revolution that killed hundreds of thousands of people before the 
vietnamese invaded 
there was no way to immediately confirm the advisers report 
friday cambodian deputy defense minister gen ke kim yan said up 
to 450 khmer rouge guerrillas were trying to carve out a liberated 
zone around pailin and had intensified 120mm mortar shelling 
firing up to 2000 rounds a day 
the cambodian resistance group led militarily by the khmer 
rouge has its bases near the thai border in thailand and in 
cambodia it receives the bulk of its arms via thailand from china 
for the past three days festive gatherings have been held across 
cambodia marking what vietnam says is the withdrawal of the last 
26000 troops it sent since invading in december 1979 to oust the 
khmer rouge 
guerrillas say the pullout which vietnam promises to complete by 
tuesday is a sham observers say they believe the movement is 
largely genuine 
crowds of villagers holding placards reading welcome the 
withdrawal vietnamese troops from cambodia applauded and cheered 
in unison after patriotic speeches by cambodian and vietnamese 
officials 
some vietnamese officers were presented with gifts and leis of 
flowers one officer was given a large portrait of the late 
vietnamese leader ho chi minh sitting with tou samuth one of the 
founders of the cambodian communist party 
a band dressed in dirty white uniforms played throughout 
cranking out offkey renditions of the national anthems of vietnam 
and cambodia 
vietnamese soldiers interviewed during the festivities said they 
were looking forward to going home but that they were concerned for 
their future 
i hope to go home and stay in the military said nguyen son 
from can tho province in vietnam but i am an enlisted man and my 
country wants to cut our armed forces 
vietnam has said it wants to cut the size of its military which 
because of its expense has contributed to the countrys economic 
difficulties son 22 said that if he cant stay in the army he 
will return to his village and farm 
the withdrawal is to end vietnams involvement in the decadelong 
war that left more than 25000 vietnamese soldiers dead and its 
economy in tatters 
the guerrillas charge that vietnam actually is leaving its troops 
behind in various disguises 
that is not possible said john mcauliff the american observer 
from the usindochina reconciliation project a philadelphiabased 
private group 
it is just physically impossible for vietnamese troops to stay 
in this country in the quantities that would be needed without 
being seen by the many foreign aid officials in cambodia and on the 
thaicambodian border he said 
i wont report that i have proof of a complete withdrawal but 
we believe that vietnam is withdrawing all its troops said bali 
ram bhagat a former indian foreign minister representing indias 
governing party

they gathered by the thousands in a high 
school stadium to pray and to cry to comfort each other and to 
remember 20 young people who died when their school bus plunged into 
a waterfilled pit 
the emptiness that we feel will not be replaced again said 
sanjuanita zamora mayor of alton the town of 3700 where the 
accident occurred a part of our lives has been taken away from 
us 
we wish we could at this moment turn the clock back to avoid 
what happened but we cannot ms zamora told more than 10000 
people at mission high schools stadium friday

over a 40foot cliff into the pit thursday morning at least 63 
people were injured three remained in critical condition late 
friday the bus was headed to the high school 
federal investigators said friday night an initial investigation 
did not produce any evidence to support the claim of truck driver 
ruben perez that his brakes failed 
nothing to date shows any indication of a failure in the 
braking system said lee dickinson a national transportation 
safety board member but he added that the probe had just begun 
meanwhile gov bill clements assigned a team to study whether 
the state should revise bus safety laws and require guard rails 
around gravel pits and similar roadside hazards 
there was no rail or fence around the pit in alton the bus had 
only one emergency exit the back door and rescuers said many of 
the students who died were trapped at the front of the vehicle 
drivers in hidalgo county which lies along the mexican border 
drove with their headlights on friday and flags were flown at

three members of the academy that awards 
the nobel prize for literature have resigned and two said they were 
unhappy that the body did not denounce irans death threat against 
salman rushdie 
the secretary of the swedish academy sture allen confirmed 
thursday he received three letters of resignation but said they 
could not be accepted because the academys 200yearold rules 
stipulate that members are elected for life 
author kerstin ekman one of the three to resign from the 
18member body told swedish radio afterward no human can at 
least in our country belong to an organization which she does not 
want to be part of i guess they just cannot admit that we 
quit 
in any case allen said the resignations will not affect the work 
of the academy he declined further comment 
the third resigning member poet werner aspenstrom did not 
disclose his reasons but told swedish television his motives 
differed from those of his two colleagues 
the resignations came weeks before the announcement of the winner 
of the nobel prize for literature the date is not set in advance 
but traditionally falls in october 
in explaining her reasons for resigning ms ekman said i am 
upset about the rushdie affair 
she and another resigning colleague former academy secretary 
lars gyllensten stopped taking part in the academys work in 
february 
they said they were protesting because the academy refused to 
condemn explicitly the death threat issued feb 14 by the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran khomeini said rushdie 
blasphemed islam in his novel the satanic verses a bestseller 
that stirred worldwide protests among moslems 
several other academy members have complained about the groups 
stand on the rushdie case but generally accepted its tradition of 
avoiding official statements on political issues 
ms ekman said the three resigning members had not planned their 
action together she said she had submitted a resignation now to let 
a substitute be elected 
she also said the academy was in need of renewal everybody 
realizes that it has come to a standstill she said 
the academy statutes were written by king gustaf iii who founded 
the institution in 1786 it has awarded the prestigious nobel prize 
for literature since 1901

rockwell international corp bowed out suddenly 
after 14 years as operator of the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
marking the final breach between the company and the government over 
hazardous waste disposal 
the move was announced late friday by the department of energy 
one day after rockwell sued the government over the dispute at the 
plant which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons the 
contractor maintained it was impossible to follow both its contract 
with doe and the waste disposal rules of the environmental 
protection agency 
the doe has identified rocky flats as the most environmentally 
hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry because toxic 
chemicals contaminate an underground reservoir and threaten nearby 
city water supplies 
adm james watkins the energy secretary said egampg inc a 
wellesley massbased scientific engineering firm had been asked 
to replace rockwell egampg officials will arrive at the plant monday 
the doe said 
watkins said he and rockwell chairman donald beall had agreed to 
change rocky flats management in the best interest of both 
parties 
colorado gov roy romer a critic of safety practices at the 
plant warned that a management change wouldnt end state efforts to 
track possible waste violations at the plant 
i am going to continue to hold the feet of doe and the operator 
to the fire to be sure that there is no endangerment to the citizens 
of colorado from the operation of the rocky flats plant romer 
said i have been informed by doe that egampg is an experienced 
operator and that there will be an orderly transition in which the 
current rocky flats employees will retain their jobs 
the decision came so suddenly that plant employees were not 
notified of the change until after the 4 pm shift change friday 
afternoon rockwell spokesman pat etchart said it was announced 
over a publicaddress system late in the afternoon etchart said 
egampg is the prime contractor for does idaho national engineering 
laboratory and is a contractor at the nevada test site and 
government facilities in new mexico 
egampg officials didnt respond to calls placed late friday to the 
firms headquarters and branch offices in several western states 
rockwell sued the government thursday in us district court in 
washington claiming conflicting federal rules require it to violate 
hazardous waste disposal laws at the plant the same day the epa 
cited rockwell for violating hazardous waste storage laws at rocky 
flats 
the lawsuit named the government the justice department the doe 
and epa and asked the court to clarify the obligations of rockwell 
and the government in running the plant 
a week ago rockwell threatened to close the plant unless the 
hazardous waste regulations were clarified later in the day doe 
environmental protection agency and colorado officials announced a 
plan to resolve the problems over the next year 
but beall said the assurances given by the government were 
inadequate to protect rockwell employees against possible criminal 
prosecution for violating the environmental rules 
the does statement said rocky flats current work force of 5000 
would not be affected by the change in management 
federal law prohibits storage of hazardous wastes at a production 
site for more than 90 days but there is no federally approved 
disposal site or treatment process for rocky flats wastes 
rockwell has been stockpiling wastes at rocky flats since idaho 
gov cecil andrus refused to accept further shipments at a temporary 
storage site in idaho

some state legislators say the us 
constitution must be amended to give states power that has been 
seized by congress 
leaders of the council on state governments here for a threeday 
conference were scheduled to vote today on a proposal to float two 
constitutional amendments intended to return power to the states 
one would have the courts settle disputes between state 
governments and congress and the other would allow states to 
initiate amendments to the constitution 
if the council which consists of about 175 legislators 
governors attorneys general and state judges decides to back the 
amendments the proposal would be forwarded to the national council 
of state legislatures 
if that 8000member group approves the proposed amendments 
members could begin seeking congressional approval in early 1990 he 
said 
this is where it really starts moving ohio senate president 
stanley aronoff a member of the council said friday 
utah senate president arnold christensen chairman of the 
councils executive committee said he expects the proposed 
amendments to win approval easily from the council i havent 
heard of any opposition he said 
a resolution approved friday by the council says the changes are 
needed because congress has intruded on state and local government 
powers by requiring states to offer certain programs without 
providing federal funds to pay for them 
aronoff a republican said an amendment calling on the courts to 
settle federalstate disputes is needed because the us supreme 
court has ruled such disputes are purely political and arent court 
matters 
the proposed change in the process for amending the constitution 
would let a threefourths vote by states enact constitutional 
amendments those amendments would take effect unless congress 
vetoed them within two years 
currently constitutional amendments can be proposed by a 
twothirds vote of both houses of congress or put forth by a 
constitutional convention called by the legislatures of twothirds 
of the states in either case amendments must be ratified by 
legislatures in threefourths of the states

a company says it has developed a painless 
way for diabetics to test their blood sugar level without having to 
prick their fingers for blood samples 
david purdy president of biocontrol technology inc of indiana 
said friday that the companys new sensor uses electromagnetic 
technology to measure blood glucose levels 
a sensor about the size of a cereal box should be ready for sale 
in about a year for use in doctors offices purdy said a homeuse 
model about the size of a portable telephone should be available in 
two years 
its an intriguing development if it works and does what they 
claim it would be a very important contribution to the care of the 
patient with diabetes said jay s skyler vice president of 
american diabetes assocation and professor of medicine at the 
university of miami 
one of the major things patients complain about is having to 
stick their fingers it really does get to be a nuisance he said 
the new glucose sensor uses a wand to direct an electromagnetic 
beam through the skin usually on the inside of the wrist purdy 
said the beam is refracted by varying amounts of blood glucose and 
returns through the wand to the sensors circuitry 
the test takes two seconds purdy said and the sensor provides a 
visual readout and a paper printout of the analysis 
such a device would be a major breakthrough in care for 
patients with diabetes said dr david finegold pediatrics 
endocrinologist at childrens hospital of pittsburgh and president 
of the western pennsylvania affiliate of the american diabetes 
association 
finegold said type i diabetics who are usually younger are a 
minority of diabetics but require the most intensive treatment 
including regular insulin injections pregnant women who are 
diabetic also are often in the type i category he said 
many physicians recommend type i diabetics draw blood as often as 
four times daily to regulate their insulin dosage finegold said 
physicians often recommend that pregnant diabetics draw blood 
samples as many as seven times each day 
more than 11 million americans have diabetes including more than 
65 million who have been diagnosed according to the american 
diabetes association in alexandria va 
the world health organization has estimated there are about 80 
million diabetics in the world according to the ada

thousands of returning residents jammed 
highways to the devastated capital today after christian army gen 
michel aoun accepted an arab peace plan and fighting ebbed between 
syria troops and aouns forces 
arab league envoy lakhdar alibrahimi entrusted with supervising 
the ceasefire held contacts with army and militia commanders ahead 
of the first meeting later today of a proposed security committee to 
check any violations 
police said traditional front lines in beirut northern lebanon 
and in eastern mountains were generally quiet 
a police spokesman said no major clashes had been reported since 
10 pm friday 
volleys of automatic gunfire can be heard every now and then 
but no clashes in the military sense of the word he said on 
condition of anonymity in line with standing regulations 
six months of fighting have killed 929 people wounded 2738 
others and forced all but 150000 people of beiruts 15 million 
residents to flee some sought refuge in safer areas in lebanon 
others left the country altogether 
thousands of cars packed with families suitcases mattresses and 
blankets jammed the main entrances to the city today 
khalil hatab said he his wife and six children had been living 
in a room they rented in southern lebanon shortly after the latest 
round of fighting broke out march 8 
can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half a 
year at certain times we even had guests relatives neighbors and 
friends who also escaped with no where to go hatab said during a 
traffic jam on ouzai the southern entrance to beirut 
he said he was returning to his home in the west beirut 
neighborhood of ras alnabaa because he believed the worst was over 
bahjat jaber a local reporter in jounieh north of beirut said 
lines of bumpertobumper cars crowded the northern entrance into 
the christian heartland which has been besieged by the syrians and 
their moslem allies for six months 
it seems like all the entire lebanese population is heading to 
beirut today he said 
he said scores of school buses also were rolling into the city 
apparently in preparation for the resumption of classes which were 
suspended during the violence 
its like magic yesterday beirut was a ghost city today it is 
bustling with life jaber said 
the security committee proposed under the peace plan would 
oversee implementation of a truce and the lifting of blockades 
imposed by the warring factions on each others ports 
it also would monitor maritime operations to assure no weapons 
shipments reach any of the lebanese factions and set the stage for a 
political settlement of lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the proposal calls for a meeting outside lebanon of the nations 
parliament to recommend political reforms that would distribute 
power equally between christians and moslems 
christians have dominated the government judiciary and army 
since lebanons independence from france in 1943 when they were 
thought to be the majority 
although no official census has been taken since 1932 moslems 
are now believed to make up 55 percent of the 4 million population

central square after scuffles broke out when rightwing whites in 
swastikamarked khaki uniforms began hustling blacks away from the 
site of an approved proapartheid rally one white rightwinger and 
several blacks were arrested 
the white extremists had received permission for their rally but 
the womens planned march to government headquarters was banned 
because organizers refused to apply for a permit the church where 
marchers were to meet was blocked off with rolls of barbed wire and 
guarded by scores of police officers 
zeni tshongweni a spokeswoman for the march organizers said 
about 200 people were arrested when they tried to assemble near the 
union buildings the government headquarters which was the intended 
destination of the march she said several people were injured when 
police used whips and dogs to disperse the crowd 
police detained richard sergay correspondent for the american 
television network abc and several other journalists 
two buses carrying winnie mandela wife of imprisoned african 
national congress leader nelson mandela and other blacks were 
chased through the streets by about 25 yellow police vehicles with 
sirens screaming and lights flashing the police stopped the buses 
and ordered mrs mandela and the other occupants to leave pretoria 
we came here peacefully but they are seeking violence mrs 
mandela told cbs news 
it is the same as any other country in the world people cant 
break the law said law and order minister adriaan vlok standing 
among riot police behind the barbed wire that blocked the entrance 
to st albans anglican cathedral 
a twopage notice was tacked to the door of the church saying 
the government obtained a court order to stop a church service and 
the planned march to the union buildings 
two tear gas cannon trucks were parked nearby and hundreds of 
police lined the streets as the city center came to a standstill 
the government banned the march because the organizers refused to 
ask for official permission although womens groups said they had 
notified top government officials including president fw de klerk 
and talked with pretoria traffic police 
the government granted permission for two white supremacist 
groups to hold rallies two blocks from the cathedral because they 
had sought permission officials said 
at the first rally a banner called for the hanging of nelson 
mandela and for the release from prison of barend strydom a white 
former policeman convicted early this year of killing seven black 
people in a shooting spree in the center of pretoria 
as the meeting ended an altercation began when about 40 blacks 
tried to walk across the square where the rally was held and were 
stopped by members of the afrikaner resistance movement who wear 
khaki uniforms and use swastika symbols 
police began herding away the blacks who were flashing peace 
signs and calling out to the whites peace we all have the same 
blood suddenly police began running through the square arresting 
blacks letting their dogs loose and ordering reporters and everyone 
else from the area 
it was not immediately clear whether the second rightwing rally 
would be allowed to go ahead 
organizers of the womens march said police blocked almost all 
traffic from the black townships around pretoria 
traffic was backed up from pretorias main thoroughfare to the 
freeway leading north from johannesburg as police at roadblocks 
stopped and searched buses and cars filled with women and turned 
them away 
about 30000 women had been expected to defy the ban and try to 
march 
about 200 women most of them white made their way to a park at 
the bottom of the ridge where the union buildings stand but police 
arrived and ordered them to leave they did not move quickly enough 
and several were arrested 
ar dawood of the transvaal indian congress said police hit some 
of the women with their batons 
in obtaining a court order against the womens march lawyers for 
the police had argued that the proximity of the rightwing rallies 
might lead to conflict 
the womens groups said they had made extensive arrangements 
including training parade marshals and setting up firstaid 
stations to ensure their march was peaceful 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in

opec ministers will take a new look at the world 
oil market over the weekend and decide whether they can increase 
production without sending crude prices tumbling 
on the eve of their talks some ministers of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries seemed reluctant to tamper with the 
cartels current output accord 
the meeting was to begin today but there was no indication of 
how long it would last 
algerias oil minister sadek boussena insisted upon arriving 
friday in geneva theres no need to raise the production 
ceiling as long as the price objective is not met 
rilwanu lukman president of opec was the last to arrive in 
geneva for the opening round of talks later in the day 
lukman the nigerian oil minister said the price of oil could 
do a little bit more 
we would like it to be 18 dollars a barrel he told 
reporters at the hotel where the ministers are staying 
iraqs oil chief issam abdul raheem alchalabi said he favored 
a reasonable increase in the supply cap he gave no specifics 
the 13nation cartel agreed in june on a production ceiling of 
195 million barrels a day in the last six months of the year its 
price target was set at 18 a 42gallon barrel 
but analysts say heavy cheating by kuwait and the united arab 
emirates has helped kick supply up to 22 million barrels a day or 
more 
prices have remained fairly firm but they are under opecs 
target 
we still have to obtain the goal of 18 we should work on 
it said ecuadors oil minister diego tamariz 
shakshuki said eighteen dollars is better than increasing the 
quota 
prices havent hit the 18 mark in the past three months 
a basket of seven major crudes monitored by opec averaged 1704 
a barrel last week it went above 18 last spring 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of american oil has 
been trading in the range of 1950 to 20 a barrel 
fergus macleod an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london 
predicted prices would slip from 50 cents to 1 a barrel if the 
cartel increased production without halting members cheating 
opec ministers agreed in june to meet this month and decide 
whether to raise their output 500000 barrels a day in the final 
three months of 1989 
macleod said such an increase probably would translate into total 
production of 225 million barrels a day 
the organizations secretarygeneral subroto of indonesia said 
that 22 million barrels a day looks like the demand for opec oil 
in the fourth quarter of the year 
in addition to the supply ceiling the ministers agenda included 
a discussion of the best way to set their quotas each country is 
assigned a daily quota 
kuwait and the united arab emirates want bigger shares as do some 
other nations to press their demands the two countries have been 
pumping as much as double their daily quotas of about a million 
barrels each analysts say 
ali khalifa alsabah the kuwaiti oil minister told reporters 
that his pledge in june to rein in production had been 
conditional 
if everybody sticks to the quota fine if anybody breaks it 
the others have the same right he said 
the talks will officially be held by an opec monitoring panel 
made up of algeria indonesia iran iraq kuwait nigeria saudi 
arabia and venezuela 
the cartel other members gabon ecuador libya qatar and the 
united arab emirates also were invited to attend

christmas and god bless america became the essence of american 
music has died at age 101 
hes been so much a part of all of us of all ages over all 
the many years said composerconductor morton gould president of 
the american society of composers authors and publishers 
of berlins music gould said its become part of our 
language part of our heartbeat part of our soul 
its the kind of finish of an era 
berlin died in his sleep at his manhattan town house friday 
afternoon said his soninlaw alton e peters asked if berlin had 
been ill peters said no he was 101 years old he just fell 
asleep 
an actor singer and songwriter berlin began his career in the 
early days of vaudeville and his songs for a time so dominated the 
stage and screen that the late composer jerome kern said berlin 
has no place in american music he is american music 
in a musical career that began with a job as a singing waiter 
berlin wrote nearly 1000 songs from his first big hit 
alexanders ragtime band in 1911 to puttin on the ritz 
which was revived in 1983 by the dutch singer taco and was a hit on 
the rock charts 
berlin was an immigrant russian whose god bless america 
became the nations unofficial second national anthem a jew his 
white christmas and easter parade became christian holiday 
traditions 
american music was born at his piano violinist isaac stern 
said on berlins 100th birthday 
so timeless was his appeal that his songs have become hits over 
and over performed by such artists as frank sinatra barbra 
streisand and diana ross ascap records show 25 of his songs have 
topped the popular music charts 
blue skies a top hit when he penned it in 1926 reached the 
charts again 51 years later on an album by country singer willie 
nelson 
berlin played the piano by ear and never stopped making what he 
described as songs with heart even in his 90s he talked of 
adding yet another musical to his credits which included 19 stage 
musicals and 15 movie scores 
at his peak one smash followed another so readily that cole 
porter once said berlin cant help but write hits 
berlin along with 11 other american immigrants received a medal 
from president reagan during the statue of liberty centennial 
celebrations in july 1986 
reagan the actor was featured in the mammoth flagwaving 1943 
movie musical this is the army with songs from berlin 
nancy and i are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully 
talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions 
and will live on forever reagan said 
always a private man berlin declined to attend a carnegie hall 
gala led by sinatra and leonard bernstein to mark his 100th 
birthday on may 11 1988 
he was mourned by artists from across the spectrum of american 
music 
irving berlin was the greatest tin pan alley songwriter said 
opera singer robert merrill who also sings berlins songs he was 
not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for 
melody and words that was precious 
composer burt bacharach who wrote the 1969 academy awardwinning 
song raindrops keep fallin on my head said this is a great 
loss but irving berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through 
his music 
one could hear the dancing by just singing the lyrics 
cabaret singer bobby short said he is perhaps the last of the 
giants and i think thats not a bad way to go 
actress and dancer ginger rogers remembered berlin with a bit of 
song from his cheek to cheek from the movie top hat 
im in heaven she sang then broke off it was like 
heaven she said describing the thrill of working with the likes 
of berlin and fred astaire 
the biggest names on broadway played in his musical successes 
which began in the world war i era with watch your step 
starring irene and vernon castle and ran through such postworld 
war ii hits as annie get your gun and call me madam both 
with ethel merman 
a pretty girl is like a melody one of many berlin wrote for 
the ziegfeld follies became the unofficial theme song for every 
ziegfeld extravaganza 
in hollywood berlin did the scores of top hat starring 
astaire and miss rogers holiday inn with astaire and bing 
crosby blue skies easter parade white christmas and 
theres no business like show business 
his last broadway show was mr president in 1962 his last 
song an old fashioned wedding was published in 1966 
his musicpublishing empire earned him a fortune which he 
readily shared with his country in wartime or with favorite causes 
since 1939 the boy scouts and girl scouts of america have been 
getting the royalties from god bless america 
berlin was awarded three medals for his works and a special tony 
award for his contribution to the musical theater he won a 
congressional medal for the acclaimed world war ii musical this 
is the army and the academy award for best song of 1942 for 
white christmas 
explaining the seemingly endless gusher of successful songs 
berlin said his tunes were merely rewrites of a handful of his best 
numbers all good songwriters have no more than half a dozen good 
tunes in their systems and if they have that many theyre liberally 
blessed he once said 
berlin never learned to read or write music and his piano playing 
was confined to the key of f sharp he called songwriting hard work 
but director josh logan once recalled that berlin dashed off the 
first verse of anything you can do i can do better during a 
sixminute cab ride 
celebrity and wealth didnt seem to touch the shy personality of 
the intense short man with wavy slickeddown hair and dark 
glasses he lived a simple life centered on his songwriting and his 
family his late wife ellin and their three daughters 
berlin was brought up in poverty amid the immigrant swarm on 
manhattans lower east side born israel baline on may 11 1888 he 
was 5 when his family emigrated from temun in eastern russia he was 
one of eight children and acquired his earliest musical education 
from his father a cantor but his fathers death put an end to 
berlins formal education and at age 8 he went from the second 
grade to the streets to earn a living 
known as izzy berlin sold newspapers guided a blind singing 
beggar and worked in vaudeville in 1907 he wrote the words to his 
first song marie of sunny italy in collaboration with the piano 
player at the chinatown bar where he worked as a singing waiter 
the song earned him 37 cents in royalties and a new name the 
sheet music cover erroneously credited the words to i berlin 
in 1911 at the age of 23 he was contributing songs to the 
ziegfeld follies his alexanders ragtime band with its ragged 
meter ushered jazz onto the popular scene and established berlin 
as a master of tin pan alley 
berlins marriage to dorothy goetz the following year ended after 
six months when his bride died of typhoid contracted during their 
honeymoon in havana in his grief berlin composed when i lost 
you 
his marriage in 1926 to ellin mackay followed one of the most 
widely reported courtships of the decade his wifes father a 
prominent roman catholic layman and head of postal telegraph co 
had opposed the union 
berlins wife died of a stroke at age 85 in july 1988 berlin is 
survived by his three daughters mary ellin linda and elizabeth 
services will be private said bill hartgrove evening manager at 
the frank campbell funeral home in manhattan

wreckage of a french airliner confirmed that explosives blew the 
plane apart above the tenere desert killing all 171 people aboard

that the flight proceeded in a normal manner until a total 
interruption indicating an inflight explosion said a statement 
from the transport ministry

individual or group responsible for the bombing tuesday of uta 
flight 772 en route from brazzaville congo to paris 
police are examining the planes passenger list for suspects 
concentrating on nine people who got off in the chad capital 
ndjamena the planes last stop before it exploded over the desert 
in eastern niger 
investigators now will attempt to determine the precise nature of 
the explosive where it was located on the aircraft and most 
importantly how it got on board

in central niger and then on to the capital niamey for 
identification french military sources in chad said rugged desert

century fortress prison that sits atop this medieval hill town 
known as the fortezza fort the prison was a castle begun by 
walter de brienne duke of athens in 1343 and completed by lorenzo 
the magnificent in 1472 it has been used as a prison since 1848 
prison officials said most of the inmates were convicted of 
belonging to organized crime syndicates such as the sicilian mafia 
neapolitan camorra and calabrian ndrangheta many were convicted of 
murder and 15 are serving life sentences 
the inmates clapped and sang as the pope entered the prison 
courtyard the area enclosed by iron bars normally serves as space 
for the inmates to play sports

the affection that i bring you to people who wish to reconcile 
themselves with society and find a new place to collaborate

there is a liberation of physical chains which for human 
beings certainly has great importance as you can testify but there 
is also a liberation from moral chains 
the pope said he was praying that the inmates show perseverance 
in your desire to collaborate in the construction of a free and just 
society

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki today 
named an opposition journalist and specialist in soviet affairs to 
head the committee that controls state media the official news 
agency announced 
andrzej drawicz 57 a solidarity activist and former political 
prisoner will take over the chairmanship of the radio and 
television committee from the former longtime government spokesman 
jerzy urban the pap agency said 
the appointment is considered one of the most important for the 
east blocs first government not led by communists removing control 
of the mass media from the communist party for the first time since 
world war ii 
mazowiecki has promised that the stateowned mass media will 
become pluralistic and honest 
the government wants to tell the truth and enable freedom of 
speech for all sections of public opinion the right of access to 
radio and television must be equal to all he said in unveiling 
his government to parliament earlier this month 
the mazowiecki cabinet installed sept 12 includes four 
communists among its 24 members 
the head of radio and television was the biggest remaining 
question mark of mazowieckis government the post will not retain 
cabinet status reflecting the new governments view that there 
should be nothing like an information minister shaping public 
opinion 
this change is not just a replacement at the post of chairman 
but it is an issue of credibility and that is why it is so 
significant for the new government said krzysztof kozlowski a 
solidarity senator from krakow who negotiated mass media reforms 
during roundtable negotiations this year 
drawicz a warsaw native has no significant experience in 
broadcasting but he is respected as a journalist and known for his 
admiration of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policies of 
perestroika and glasnost or economic restructuring and openness 
like mazowiecki and thousands of other solidarity activists 
drawicz was jailed after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown on 
solidarity the communist party reversed itself this year and agreed 
to reinstate solidaritys legal status 
solidarity then scored a landslide victory in june parliamentary 
elections enabling it to form a coalition and take control of the 
government 
drawicz has published many articles both in the statesanctioned 
and underground press about the changes taking place in the soviet 
union under gorbachev he is also a translator of russian literature 
urban whom drawicz replaces was the chief defender of communist 
policies as government spokesman from 1981 until this year

the main guerrilla group fighting to end 
white rule in south africa has dismissed president fw de klerks 
pledges of reform and called for continued violence against the 
pretoria government 
the african national congress released a statement friday night 
saying the rhetoric mouthed by de klerk at his inauguration once 
more bears out our firm conviction that no white minority regime 
possesses either the will or the capacity to bring about a 
fundamental change of south africa 
the promises to execute his mandate for change over five years 
are as empty as they are insolent 
de klerk said in his inaugural address wednesday that the 
government would deal firmly with unrest and terrorism 
the anc responded his undisguised threat to persist in a 
policy of repression against people testifies to the violence 
intrinsic to the system over which he presides 
this intransigent attitude leaves us no option but to 
continuously escalate our multipronged offensive including its armed 
component to overthrow the regime of racist tyranny the anc said 
the african national congress formed an exile headquarters in 
zambia and began a campaign of sabotage in 1961 a year after it was 
banned in south africa

of cliffs notes from the real thing especially because the parody 
publication is labeled satire five times on the cover a court 
said 
the explanation released friday by the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals gives the background for the courts sept 5 decision to 
let spy magazine sell its sendup of cliffs student guide to 
classic literature 
the ruling overturns a lower court order issued at the request of 
cliffs notes inc which sued the spy notes publisher bantam 
doubleday dell publishing group inc over the satire 
the publisher complained that spy notes which pokes fun at two 
novels popular with the yuppie set looks too much like the slender 
cliffs pamphlets students have been using for years to crib 
comments for book reports 
spy notes gives humorous plot summaries commentary and questions 
for review on the contemporary novel bright lights big city by 
jay mcinerney and slaves of new york a short story collection 
by tama janowitz 
it includes the novelomatic a slide rulelike device so 
readers can create their own 1980s novels 
the threejudge appeals panel wrote we conclude that the 
parody cover of spy notes although it surely conjures up the 
original and goes to great lengths to use some of the identical 
colors and aspects of the cover design of cliffs notes raises only 
a slight risk of consumer confusion that is outweighed by the public 
interest in free expression 
the judges noted that the cover of spy notes carries the words 
a satire five times in bright red letters on the front cover and 
four times on the back they also said that a substantial portion of 
spy notes potential audience college students or collegeeducated 
adults overlaps with cliffs notes audience 
as a result the name spy in the title the notation a spy 
book emblazoned on the cover of spy notes and the use of a prepack 
marketing device prominently displaying the spy name should alert 
the buyer that spy notes is a parody of some sort or at least that 
it is not the same product as cliffs notes the judges said 
doubleday spokeswoman jacqueline deval said spy notes would be on 
sale in two weeks

iran denied today it was involved in two 
bomb blasts in mecca in july and tehransupported terrorists vowed 
to avenge saudi arabias execution of 16 shiite moslems convicted of 
setting the explosions 
irans official islamic republic new agency and tehran radio 
quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as urging moslems around the 
world to break their silence over these atrocities by saudi 
arabias royal rulers 
a statement from the fundamentalist hezbollah said the executions 
were a terrorist act the deep grudge which rules the actions 
of the terrorist pagan regime will be a motive for avenging the 
blood of the oppressed 
hezbollah or the party of god is the proiranian umbrella group 
thought to hold 16 westerners hostage in lebanon including eight 
americans 
a pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims were wounded in 
the bombings on july 10 near the grand mosque in mecca islams 
holiest city 
sixteen kuwaiti nationals were beheaded thursday for the blasts 
believed connected to an ageold feud between sunni and shiite 
moslems most iranians are shiites while saudis and other gulf 
state arabs are mainly sunnis 
irans spokesman who was not identified denied saudi charges 
that iranian diplomats in kuwait trained and equipped the terrorists 
who set off explosions at the height of the moslem pilgrimage or 
hajj 
he said recorded confessions of the condemned men screened by 
saudi television were false allegations disseminated by the 
riyadh government 
saudi arabia said the executed men all were kuwaiti nationals 
but most were of iranian saudi or qatari origin four other 
defendants were sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison and 1000 to 
1500 whiplashes for the bombings another nine people were 
acquitted the rulings were made and upheld by lower and appeal 
courts made up of islamic scholars 
the iranian spokesman rejected confessions by the condemned men 
that they were provided with explosives and timing devices by two 
iranian officers at the embassy in kuwait mohammed reza gholoum and 
sadek ali reza 
those people were never employed in the iranian embassy in 
kuwait and the kuwaiti government is fully aware of this the 
spokesman said 
kuwait has not commented on the executions 
the iranian spokesman said the attacks were carried out by 
mercenaries working for saudi arabia to suppress moslems who 
reject the saudi rulers control of the two holy shrines 
mecca and medina 
two years ago he charged saudi arabia pushed pilgrims into 
blood and dust for the crime of disavowing the pagans 
more than 400 people mostly iranians died in clashes with saudi 
security forces in mecca in 1987 
the disturbances were the most serious of a series of incidents 
during pilgrimages since irans islamic revolution in 1979 fueled 
by iranian efforts to politicize the hajj and encourage other moslem 
nations to seize shrines at mecca and medina from the control of the 
kingdoms saud royal family 
after the violence saudi arabia limited the number of pilgrims 
and two years ago broke relations with tehran citing subversion and 
terrorism 
lately irans new president hashemi rafsanjani has indicated he 
would like to mend the rift 
the iranian spokesman said riyadhs accusations against tehran 
are part of a campaign by saudi defense minister prince sultan and 
interior minister nayef bin abdelaziz to keep relations strained 
this faction strongly desires continuation of enmity it said

president bush taking a break today from 
recreation and work on his united nations speech called on lawyers 
to involve themselves in community service and protect the 
unprotected 
bush in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon of the 
catholic lawyers guild also urged the legal community to work for 
rights of the unborn in the fight over abortion 
use your talents your energy and your professional resources 
to reaffirm the right to life as the most fundamental freedom he 
said 
the president travelled to boston from his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine where he is spending the weekend before 
heading to the united nations on monday 
hitting one of his favorite themes the call to community 
service bush told the lawyers in his speech to help the 
illiterate the homeless and others in need 
i challenge you as catholic lawyers not to give in to the 
dismay of those today who in the error of alarm have wandered from 
the basic convictions to which our nation is pledged i challenge 
you to rekindle and foster a love of justice 
part of your task is to use your talents to speak for those 
unable to speak for themselves we must remember the 
unremembered protect the unprotected and stand up for those who 
live in a world of pain bush said 
at kennebunkport preparations for his first speech as president 
to the un on monday were dominating bushs work agenda over the 
weekend an administration official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
central part of bushs address would be eastwest relations 
including the talks that were concluding in wyoming today between 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze 
officials in wyoming said baker and shevardnadze reached 
agreement on onsite inspections of each others underground nuclear 
test sites and on trial verification of each others stockpiles 
of longrange nuclear weapons 
bush met with shevardnadze at the white house on thursday and 
received a letter from soviet president mikhail gorbachev on arms 
control issues 
bush stopped on the way to kennebunkport to stump for the gops 
embattled gubernatorial candidate in new jersey rep jim courter 
courter is in an uphill race against democratic rep james florio 
to replace the outgoing republican gov thomas kean 
in sharply partisan remarks bush told a fundraising luncheon 
the contest represents the future versus the past policies that 
work versus policies that dont a better future for our children 
or one of lost opportunity 
he also defended his plan to cut the capital gains tax against 
democratic charges that it would be a tax break for the rich it 
is a tax adjustment that is going to create jobs in america and that 
is why i am going to continue to fight for it said bush 
before heading to his seaside compound bush also made a brief 
stop at a remote tree farm in nearby wells to underscore his 
position on capital gains taxes which are levied on profits from 
sales of real estate stocks and other assets 
farm owner martin morse told bush that 1986 changes in the 
capital gains tax law had cost him more than 4000 in one year 
morse said tree farmers must pay capital gains tax on sales of their 
trees because the trees are considered tangible assets rather than 
merchandise 
bush also squeezed in nine holes of golf before nightfall with 
his national security adviser brent scowcroft and fished for a 
short time

less than two years after the united 
states withdrew from cambodia khmer rouge guerrillas swept in from 
the bush to unleash one of the most barbaric revolutions of modern 
times 
this month as vietnam withdraws troops that have propped up the 
communist government the khmer rouge again are poised to strike 
from the jungles and many fear that cambodia will again become the 
land of the killing fields 
led by a ruthless communist with the alias of pol pot the khmer 
rouge withstood massive us bombing and won the cambodian war with 
probably no more than 60000 fighters in 1975 their opponents the 
government of usbacked gen lon nol fielded 300000 men 
the ratio is roughly the same today khmer rouge strength is 
estimated at 30000 to 40000 and phnom penhs at about 150000 
while there are new power brokers in phnom penh the top khmer 
rouge leadership remains unchanged although the 61yearold pol pot 
claimed he resigned from his last official post in june he still is 
believed to be in firm command 
the secretive guerrilla chief who has refused interviews for 10 
years spends his time along the thaicambodian border and in china 
the key khmer rouge arms supplier 
other durable veterans are pol pots righthand man ieng sary and 
nominal khmer rouge head khieu samphan whose doctoral thesis was 
the blueprint for a bloody agrarian revolution 
heading the khmer rouge army is son sen who approved the grisly 
tortures and executions of 20000 alleged dissidents at phnom penhs 
tuol sleng prison during the 197578 reign of terror another key 
commander is ta mok known as the butcher for his murderous ways 
these men have admitted to only some mistakes and claim to 
have changed policies and methods 
after being driven from phnom penh by a vietnamese invasion in 
january 1979 the khmer rouge operated from bases along the rugged 
thaicambodian frontier from there its leaders announced they had 
shed radical communism in favor of private property freedom of 
religion and a nonaligned foreign policy 
it was a dramatic shift one met by instant skepticism in their 
heydey the khmer rouge had cleansed the old society by killing 
hundreds of thousands driving buddhist monks from their monasteries 
and turning cambodia into a slave labor camp where even knives and 
forks were considered communal property 
no mass executions have been reported in khmer rougecontrolled 
areas since 1979 but defectors international aid workers and human 
rights groups indicate life under the khmer rouge remains slavelike 
beatings and occasional executions are meted out for violating 
decrees women and youngsters are conscripted as porters for the 
military and forced at times to trek through minefields religious 
worship is permitted only at showcase camps contact with foreigners 
is severely restricted to the point of denying the gravely ill 
medical treatment offered by aid agencies 
perhaps the most damning testimony comes from prince norodom 
sihanouk noncommunist leader of a threeparty guerrilla resistance 
that includes the khmer rouge 
one has to be either naive or an idiot to believe that the 
khmer rouge of the 80s can be different from the khmer rouge of the 
70s he has said 
the khmer rouge a term coined by sihanouk meaning red 
cambodians emerged in the 1960s and began its armed struggle in 
1968 as the war in neighboring vietnam was reaching a climax 
with ideology borrowed from mao tsetung and french leftists and 
with support from vietnams communists and a segment of cambodias 
rural population the small ragged band quickly grew into a 
movement its initial appeal sprang from real grievances of the 
peasantry and centuries of humiliation by cambodias more powerful 
neighbors 
on april 17 1975 phnom penh fell and its more than 2 million 
people were forced at gunpoint to march into the countryside and 
plant rice under appalling conditions 
for the victors it was year zero the remaking of society 
from scratch for most of cambodias 8 million people it was the 
beginning of an agony that lasted three years eight months and 20 
days 
the defeated khmer rouge army and its civilian followers 
straggled to the thai border in 1979 sapped by malaria hunger and 
hanois juggernaut it appeared pol pots days were numbered 
but the khmer rouge was saved by geopolitics and international 
relief aid the united states china noncommunist southeast asia 
and others were eager to bring vietnam to its knees and the khmer 
rouge was the most readily available instrument 
china provided weapons thailand allowed the use of its territory 
and the majority of un member states vote year after year to 
include the khmer rouge as part of the sihanouk coalition to 
represent cambodia at the world body 
critics charge this is the moral equivalent of inviting hitler to 
sit in the united nations after world war ii and western aid 
officials struggle with the fact that they kept what some call a 
monster alive by continuing food medical and other aid along the 
thaicambodian border 
after 11 years of war and the breakdown of peace talks the khmer 
rouge faces a new turning point 
with hanois soldiers still on the way out the khmer rouge and 
phnom penh forces already are testing each other in a major battle 
for the the gemrich border town of pailin 
western analysts regard the khmer rouge as the strongest of the 
three guerrilla factions and probably tougher than the governments 
sovietsupplied army 
the khmer rouge in the last three months controls much more 
territory than they did before said mao souen a defector from 
the cambodian government army

reach into your pocket for a quarter two or 
three years from now and you may find a different portrait of george 
washington on the front and a flag instead of an eagle on the back 
a majority of the nations senators and representatives are bored 
with the nations money not how its spent but how it looks 
theyre tired of the eagle thomas jeffersons home and the lincoln 
memorial on the reverse or tails side of quarters nickels 
and pennies and believe americans want new coins not so fixed in 
the past 
at least 260 of the 435 house members and 66 of the 100 senators 
have signed on as cosponsors of legislation originated by the us 
commission of fine arts calling for new coins 
under a bill approved by the senate in june without opposition 
and now working its way through the house the treasury department 
would be required to modernize their designs beginning with the 
quarter 
the weight size and color of each coin would not change and 
portraits although not the same ones of abraham lincoln 
jefferson franklin d roosevelt washington and john f kennedy 
would still adorn the obverse or heads sides of the penny 
nickel dime quarter and half dollar 
but the eagle now emblazoned on the reverse side of quarters and 
half dollars monticello on the nickel and the lincoln memorial on 
the penny would be replaced by themes celebrating the constitution 
and the bill of rights 
similar legislation was approved by the senate last year with 
hopes of having the new coins in circulation for the 198991 
bicentennial celebration of the constitution 
it never got anywhere in the house because of opposition from 
rep frank annunzio dill then chairman of the house banking 
committees subcommittee on coinage 
annunzio who now chairs another subcommittee likes the present 
designs and looks upon efforts by coin collectors to change them as 
a low if not minuscule priority 
changes in our money make americans very very uneasy he 
said we have plenty of serious issues confronting us that need 
our attention a trade imbalance a budget deficit a drug 
epidemic an education crisis on a scale of importance from one to 
10 coin design change rates a zero 
his successor as the panels chairman rep richard lehman 
dcalif has no strong views one way or the other but after an 
emotional hearing this summer he wants to proceed cautiously 
there are some people who are very vocal about redesigning 
coins but theres no public clamor out there for it lehman said 
in an interview 
the treasury is not too keen on the idea even though the 
department calculates it would raise an additional 250 million in 
sorely needed government revenues over the next six years 
the revenues would be in the form of seniorage the 
difference between the face value of the coin and what it costs the 
us mint to produce it for example it costs the mint only three 
cents to strike a quarter creating a seniorage of 22 cents 
mint director donna pope said officials anticipate that a new 
design would slightly increase the demand for coins in circulation 
raising seniorage revenues as some people hold on to either the 
old or new editions 
but the revenues are not great enough to alone justify a change 
she maintains a point echoed by some congressmen i think the 
public would be very cynical of our efforts if thats why were 
doing it said rep john hiler rind 
missing from the coin redesign debate said ms pope is 
any evidence that the general american public the noncollecting 
public is dissatisfied with current coin designs or even favors 
new ones 
several lawmakers also remember what happened the last time 
congress decided to order a change in coinage other than the special 
commemorative editions for collectors now produced by the us mint 
about 300 million susan b anthony silver dollars that congress 
ordered in 1978 now sit in government vaults because of an 
overwhelming rejection by the public 
annunzio blames the anthony dollar and its failure on the womens 
caucus in congress 
the women on the banking committee collared every male member 
of that committee and the poor guys couldnt say no he said 
they created an atmosphere of hysteria thats the reason it 
passed 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas now the banking committees 
chairman and a vehement supporter for redesigning the nations 
coins questioned during a hearing last year how many people knew 
who susan b anthony was she was a leader of the womens suffrage 
movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s 
maybe if wed had marilyn monroe there would have been more 
popularity gonzalez joked 
but to annunzios charge that the anthony dollar was a poorly 
conceived product of the womens movement gonzalez said thats 
what happens when you dont have sex equality 
the biggest advocate for changing the design of us coins is 
diane wolfe a new yorker who as an appointee of president reagan 
to the national commission on fine arts adopted the issue as a 
cause in 1987 
ms wolfe persuaded the commission to call for new designs found 
sponsors for the legislation and then generated letterwriting 
campaigns on its behalf among thousands of coin collectors 
the current designs are ordinary and boring ms wolfe says 
the images and symbols from the great depression will no longer 
suffice we need images and symbols created by our best artists for 
this generation and for our time 
lehman however wants to amend the legislation to call for a 
temporary change in only one coin most likely the quarter a new 
edition reflecting the 200th anniversary of the constitution would 
be struck but only for two years 
during that time the treasury department would be instructed to 
come up with possible new designs but the decision on adopting each 
would return to congress 
the treasury now has the authority to redesign coins every 25 
years but except for the susan anthony dollar and special editions 
of the quarter half dollar and silver dollar in 197576 
commemorating the bicentennial of the american revolution the last 
design change was the adoption of the kennedy half dollar in 1964 
we should not minimize the psychological impact on the public 
of any change especially touching on the national economy as it 
seems to threaten its personal and national sense of security 
says elvira clainstefanelli executive director of the smithsonian 
institutions coin collection 
as an example ms clainstefanelli cites vd brenners design 
of the lincoln penny the reverse or tails side was changed in 1959 
to the lincoln memorial but the obverse or heads side has been 
unchanged since 1909 
brenners creation has been endowed with the same immortality 
as that of the national figure it depicts she said 
changing it now she said gives her a slightly uneasy 
feeling 
ms wolf dismisses many of the concerns as downright 
laughable and contends that skeptics who cite the failure of the 
susan anthony dollar are mixing soup and nuts 
were the only western world country stuck in a rut and our 
coins should not be stuck in a rut she says

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain today 
predicted success for the sweeping reform agenda of mikhail s 
gorbachev saying change has gone too far to be stopped 
i believe perestroika is now set on its course and will go 
through to success the british leader told a news conference 
after four hours of talks with the soviet president during her 
oneday stopover between tokyo and london 
the two leaders met amid reports of a breakthrough in ussoviet 
arms negotiations 
it was their fifth meeting since gorbachev was named communist 
party chief in 1985 mrs thatcher was the first major western 
leader to see gorbachev since this summers wave of strikes by 
miners in the ukraine and siberia and flareups of ethnic violence in 
georgia uzbekistan and kazakhstan 
she expressed great confidence in the 58yearold kremlin leader 
and his program for economic and social reforms saying it opens 
up vistas and horizons not available to the people of the soviet 
union for some 70 years 
asked about current domestic woes faced by gorbachevs reform 
drive she replied anything bold and purposeful will have 
difficulties to it 
one of the topics discussed by the leaders was arms control and 
mrs thatcher said she had been in touch with president bush on 
the matter before meeting with gorbachev at the kremlin 
however she declined to comment on anything gorbachev may have 
told her on the reported dramatic swing in the soviet position on a 
superpower treaty being negotiated to slash longrange nuclear 
weapons arsenals 
some observers said mrs thatchers good relations with bush and 
gorbachev could help produce a breakthrough in superpower 
negotiations to cut the number of longrange nuclear missiles in 
half 
but the breakthrough came in wyoming where shevardnadze met 
friday and today with secretary of state james a baker iii 
us officials said friday the soviet union was dropping its 
insistence on limits on the star wars missile defense system before 
signing a treaty that would slash the number of longrange bombers 
missiles and nuclear submarines the two sides also were reported 
near agreement on inspection of each others underground nuclear 
test sites 
asked whether gorbachev had mentioned the switch in the soviet 
position mrs thatcher told reporters at the soviet foreign 
ministry press center that any announcement on that subject should 
be made in the united states 
on other disarmament topics she said she left her meeting with 
gorbachev believing east and west can reach an agreement reducing 
coventional weaponry by next year she also said prospects were 
encouraging for a ban on chemical weapons 
mrs thatchers personal relationship with gorbachev is warm 
although she retains a watchful eye on soviet military power 
relations between britain and the soviet union slid several 
months ago when the british expelled 11 soviet journalists and 
diplomats on complaints of spying and the soviets retaliated by 
expelling 11 britons 
but the tass news agency said today in soviet diplomatic 
circles it is believed that these differences should not be viewed 
as an obstacle to the development of relations between the two 
nations

concern about the environment is prompting a 
new push for automakers to produce more fuel efficient cars but the 
industry says with gasoline prices low their customers want 
performance and size over fuel economy 
according to environmental protection agency figures the auto 
industrys move toward higher mileage cars has all but come to a 
halt in recent years 
average fleetwide mileage jumped from 131 mpg in 1975 to 211 
mpg in 1982 since then it has been creeping and often standing 
still the epa mileage list announced last week reflected a fleet 
average of 24 mpg the same as a year earlier 
but growing environmental concerns and the link between 
automobile pollution and global warming has unleashed new calls for 
the industry to produce more fuel efficient vehicles 
legislation by sen richard bryan dnev to require a 40 
percent increase in average automobile fuel efficiency by the turn 
of the century is given a good chance of passing the senate 
that would put the average fleetwide mileage for most 
manufacturers at about 40 mpg only some of the stingiest and 
smallest subcompacts are able to obtain those kinds of mileage 
figures today 
no similar proposal has emerged in the house where it would face 
the strong opposition of rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
energy and commerce committee 
but even serious discussion of such sharp increases in auto 
mileage is a far cry from only a year ago when a reagan 
administration proposal to scrap federal fuel efficiency standards 
altogether received considerable support on capitol hill president 
bush has made no such suggestion 
past demands for higher auto mileage were prompted by oil 
shortages and high gasoline prices today there is neither 
so what is driving the renewed interest in fuel efficiency 
the first and foremost reason is concern about global 
warming says robert dewey an analyst for the energy conservation 
coalition a group that includes many of the largest environmental 
and conservation organizations 
environmentalists also have argued that cutting the demand for 
gasoline is the best way to curb the need for oil and thereby 
preserve pristine wilderness and environmentally delicate coastal 
areas that otherwise might be opened for drilling 
there also is continuing concern about the growing dependence on 
imported oil in 1985 oil imports accounted for 32 percent of all 
oil used in this country last july imports exceeded 50 percent 
said deborah bleviss executive director of the international 
institute for energy conservation 
but it is the automobiles link to global warming that has given 
the issue a new spark 
motor vehicles account for about a fourth of the releases in the 
united states of carbon dioxide a major contributor to what many 
scientists believe is a warming of the earth because of manmade 
pollution 
carbon dioxide combines with other chemicals to form a gaseous 
veil in the atmosphere that traps heat like a greenhouse many 
scientists believe this greenhouse effect if left unchecked 
will cause a dangerous warming of the earth by the middle of the 
next century 
its time detroit stopped protecting their gas guzzlers and 
started protecting our planet by producing safe efficient vehicles 
citizens want ruth caplan executive director of the 
environmental action foundation said recently as her group unveiled 
plans to distribute a series of 30second television ads linking 
cars to global warming 
but the auto industry argues that it is being picked on unfairly 
a requirement for cars to achieve and average fuel economy of 40 
mpg does little to address the global warming problems because 
carbon dioxide releases from us cars account for only 25 percent 
of all the worlds greenhouse gases maintains helen petrauskas 
vice president for environmental and safety engineering at ford 
motor co 
and to achieve such mileage increases will require automakers to 
reduce the size of their cars she and other auto executives insist 
there may be a lot of talk about higher mileage requirements but 
market indicators are just the opposite says ronald boltz a vice 
president for chrysler corp he said customers are placing a 
premium on vehicle performance and less emphasis on fuel 
economy 
cars such as the highmileage geo metro a japanesemade 
subcompact sold by general motors account for only 1 percent of 
us passenger car sales echoed marina whitman a gm vice president

when government auditors in may 1988 asked 
benton mortgage co president thomas ford whether he knew an agency 
official named deborah gore dean he responded that he had been 
introduced to her 
six months later the department of housing and urban development 
auditors traveled to tennessee to brief benton officials on their 
critical findings they encountered a familiar face 
it was deborah gore dean then a privately employed housing 
consultant 
ms dean the former top aide to hud secretary samuel pierce 
objected on the spot to the strong and harsh language used in 
various portions of the report one auditor wrote in his notes 
the notes are among boxes of working papers used to compile the 
audit the documents made available to the associated press 
provide a case study of the revolving door at hud that agency 
and congressional investigators believe contributed to scandals 
during the reagan administration 
ms dean is just one of more than a dozen former hud officials 
who had dealings with benton a major lender in hud programs now 
facing an fbi investigation of its conduct 
some of the former hud officials work at benton others are 
consultants to the firm and others still were developers who got 
financing through the knoxville lender 
the auditors concluded that three former hud officials including 
ambassador to switzerland philip winn reaped millions in 
unjustified profits by using their knowledge of hud rules to 
create paper development and construction companies to increase 
hud subsidies 
the former officials often financed their projects through 
benton which has handled more than 2 billion in hud financing in 
the past 25 years 
the federal investigators reviewed 14 of the more than 250 hud 
projects in which benton has participated and found in none of the 
14 did the company use prudent underwriting practices 
in fact the report said many of the properties were appraised by 
benton at exorbitant levels allowing the company to reap larger 
fees on its hudbacked mortgages 
the audit recommended administrative sanctions against benton 
the company has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing saying it received 
hud clearances for items questioned by the auditors 
still the working papers indicate that benton officials made it 
no secret that they retained former hud officials to win favors at 
the agency 
ford told the auditors benton retained washington attorney lynda 
murphy a former hud official and a close friend of ms deans 
when benton needed a waiver from hud according to the working 
papers 
michael karem another former hud official who occassionally 
worked for benton is paid to do waivers ford told the 
auditors according to their notes 
half the 14 benton projects reviewed received waivers in most 
cases permission to charge the maximum allowable rents in hud 
projects involved in a rehabilitation program since lowincome 
tenants pay only a fraction of their income as rent higher rents 
mean higher costs for hud 
while murphy karem and other former hud officials were helping 
benton and developers of projects it financed win waivers another 
former hud official was being called on by the company to appraise 
property 
the auditors found it peculiar that benton on five occassions 
hired a washingtonbased appraiser to review properties located in 
the south and southwest because of the higher fees for travel 
the auditors according to their notes said they could find no 
reason for hiring the appraiser a former hud official unless the 
distant firm gave the mortgagee the appraisal value that it wanted 
for the project 
the 14 projects reviewed participated in huds section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program a nationwide audit of that program triggered 
the hud investigations 
in that report huds inspector general found that former agency 
officials appeared to have received special treatment as well as 
donors to a charity that a ranking hud official helped found 
winn and partners philip abrams and j michael queenan were 
developers or consultants on many of the 14 projects reviewed 
increasing their profits by setting up development and contracting 
companies that the auditors said were in most cases disbanded after 
a project was completed in essence the winn group made profits as 
builders and developers of projects in addition to their profits as 
owners 
when not involved in the ownership of a bentonfinanced project 
queenan often served as a consultant as did a partner former hud 
official ronny mahon 
included in the audit papers are canceled checks showing queenan 
made at least 216000 in consulting fees from benton mahon 
363578 
also among the canceled checks are a handful of benton donations 
to food for africa a charity that former hud assistant secretary 
thomas demery helped establish it was demery who was in charge of 
most housing programs who granted most of the waivers benton got on 
the audited projects the canceled checks to food total 19000 
all expenses appear to be legal however contributions to an 
organization which tom demery is secretary is a strong indicator 
that contributions are made if you want to be involved in huds mod 
rehab program the auditors wrote 
they also found that benton contributed 15000 to the 
presidents dinner a fundraiser to help former president reagan 
buy a house in california 
the 15000 payment for the presidents dinner is another 
indicator of mod rehab units being awarded based on political 
consideration the auditors said

robert bork says the conservative direction of 
the supreme court with newest member anthony kennedy on board is 
little different from how the court would have leaned had he won 
confirmation instead 
bork whose appointment to a supreme court seat in 1987 touched 
off a bitter fight between liberal and conservative groups says he 
has generally agreed with the justices with just one notable 
exception he would have voted to uphold a texas law banning flag 
burning 
bork made the comments in an interview about his new book the 
tempting of america the political seduction of the law to be 
published in the next few months although it is not specifically 
about the failed nomination a number of pages discuss the supreme 
court bid bork said 
other books about borks fight for a supreme court seat also are 
about to roll off the presses two years after the defeat of the 
conservative legal scholar 
i just think there will be a lot of these books in the next few 
years this is one people are going to chew on for a long time 
says conservative activist patrick b mcguigan whose forthcoming 
book the ninth justice our fight for bork was written with 
dawn weyrich 
it tells the inside story of the conservative battle to swing the 
senate in favor of bork 
a view from the liberal side is upcoming in the people rising 
the campaign against the bork nomination by former federal trade 
commission chairman michael pertschuk and journalist wendy schaetzel 
borks own book looks at the broad sweep of american history and 
argues that the law fell prey to politics he said he declined to 
go into much detail about the contents but said that if he had it to 
do over he would change very little about his testimony before 
the senate judiciary committee 
what i said was what i think said bork 
at a distance of two years bork takes his rejection by the 
senate philosophically i dont like what happened but do i go 
around being bitter no 
after borks rejection thenpresident reagan nominated federal 
judge douglas ginsburg for the supreme court seat vacated by justice 
lewis f powell ginsburg however withdrew in the midst of a furor 
over his earlier marijuana use reagan then nominated kennedy who 
was easily confirmed by the senate 
one bork book already on the shelves battle for justice by 
reporter ethan bronner recently brought a complaint from chief 
justice william h rehnquist he said the book was incorrect in 
saying he informed the white house of powells retirement plans the 
same day powell informed him and thus broke a promise of overnight 
secrecy 
that statement is in error rehnquist said he said he did 
not contact the white house until the following day 
liberal critics of bork who are grumbling privately that they 
should have been portrayed more favorably by bronners book are 
virtually guaranteed to be consoled by pertschuks account 
pertschuk acknowledges that his book takes as its heroes such 
groups as people for the american way and the alliance for justice 
which crusaded against bork we consider it an example of high 
democracy he says 
washington attorney mark gittenstein chief counsel to the senate 
judiciary committee during the bork hearings also is at work on a 
bork book 
i guess my slant is the role of the senate he says im 
looking at it from where i was im also trying to look a little 
deeper at some of the issues that were involved 
mcguigan says ohio state university political scientist greg 
caldeira is writing what could be the definitive book about the 
struggle 
it will be scholarly he said it will be more detached he 
has been interviewing me and a lot of the leftists as well

a man sought in france for a string of 
holdups and prison escapes committed suicide today during a shootout 
with police that occurred after he released three hostages police 
said 
police first reported they killed philippe delaire 28 of france 
and seriously wounded one of his belgian accomplices tony wagemans 
31 during the shootout in an apartment building but prosecutor 
anne bourguignont later told reporters that delaire killed himself 
during the confrontation 
a third gunman belgian edouard delecki 36 was arrested 
unharmed 
the shootout ended a standoff that began sept 16 when the three 
men kidnapped a bank manager his wife and their two daughters in 
their home in tilff a residential southern suburb of liege 
the banker escaped and alerted police who surrounded the villa 
after a week of negotiations with policemen the three gunmen 
agreed to release their hostages for a ransom of 750000 and an

iraqs army has launched a new offensive 
against kurdish guerrillas in their northern stronghold near the 
iranian border the first major assault in a year a guerrilla 
spokesman said saturday 
the 24th division or the iraqi army supported by artillery and 
helicopter gunships has sought to encircle the region controlled 
by the guerrillas and move in to captures kurdish bases said 
the official of the outlawed patriotic union of kurdistan 
at least 57 iraqi soldiers have been killed in clashes since 
sept 18 in iraqs northeastern mountains he said 
he put losses among the guerrillas known as peshmergas or 
those who face death at three killed and 12 wounded 
the official who is known to the associated press spoke in a 
telephone interview from a west european capital he asked that his 
name and location not be mentioned for security reasons 
fighting centered north of qala diza the city whose population 
was forcibly evacuated by the iraqis several months ago in a drive 
to create a buffer zone along the iranian border to prevent the 
guerrillas from receiving support from the iran the official 
charged 
earlier this year he said tens of thousands of kurds from 
scores of villages around qala diza were forced out and their 
settlements were razed the city is 15 miles west of the border 
so far all the iraqi assaults have been repulsed he reported 
the iraqis have turned the area into one big freefire zone in 
recent months they claim weve been crushed but this shows that 
the kurdish resistance is alive and kicking 
diplomats in baghdad and kurdish officials estimate more than 
250000 kurds have been relocated forcibly over the past two years 
and hundreds of villages have been razed in iraqi efforts to isolate 
the guerrillas 
the iraqi government admits it has moved large numbers of kurdish 
civilians to other regions but officials say this was for 
unspecified security reasons and to provide villagers with modern 
housing 
iraqs 35 million kurds have been fighting on and off for more 
than 50 years for an autonomous homeland 
the government promises limited autonomy and earlier this month 
held elections in kurdistan for a legislative assembly 
kurdish separatists charge the assembly is powerless and branded 
the voting no different to previous sham elections held since 
1975 when the assembly first was established 
iraqs last major offensive against the iranianbacked kurdish 
guerrillas was august 1988 soon after a unsponsored truce halted 
its eightyear war with iran the iraqis allegedly used poison gas 
in attacks that forced tens of thousands of kurds to flee into 
neighboring iran and turkey baghdad denies the charges 
about 19 million kurds live in the mountainous region where the 
borders of turkey iran and iraq meet another 1 million are 
scattered in the southwestern soviet union and northeastern syria

president fw de klerk has 
brought a new style and new possibilities to south african politics 
but an array of obstacles stands in the way of his professed goals 
of peace justice and blackwhite powersharing 
yet the fact that de klerk states these goals repeatedly and 
earnestly sets him apart from the men who preceded him in power 
prominent black opponents of his government are deeply skeptical 
and they may be proved right some of them concede however that 
the government for the first time has adopted a rhetoric if not yet 
a policy that reflects some of their own hopes 
his vision of a new south africa is the vision we want 
said anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of the 1984 nobel 
peace prize and one of the governments most persistent critics 
so sweeping are some of de klerks statements no more white 
domination a phasing out of discrimination that he may find he 
has raised expectations he cannot meet 
he acknowledged this in his inaugural speech wednesday saying he 
would not accept responsibility for overenthusiastic or twisted 
versions of his policy 
he will be under heavy pressure to move quickly with 
antiapartheid leaders and western governments saying they want 
decisive steps taken within the next several months among the moves 
de klerk will consider 
releasing nelson mandela walter sisulu and other jailed leaders 
of the african national congress guerrilla movement de klerk knows 
that a broad range of black leaders will refuse to negotiate on a 
new constitution unless mandela goes free and is likely to approve 
the release despite fears in some government quarters that it could 
spark a wave of unrest 
modifying or repealing the remaining legislative cornerstones of 
apartheid the laws which classify south africans by race allow 
municipalities to segregate public facilities and establish 
segregated residential districts 
the continued removal of discrimination is an important 
objective said de klerk in his inaugural speech but he has yet 
to renounce his support for segregated schools and neighborhoods 
lifting the state of emergency which has been in effect since 
june 1986 de klerk says hopes to create a climate in which the 
emergency can be ended and he already has negated some of impact by 
ordering police to allow peaceful mass protest marches but police 
continue to detain activists without charge 
gavin relly chairman of south africas largest conglomerate and 
frequent critic of apartheid has urged the international community 
to give de klerk a chance to carry out his program without imposing 
a timetable or threatening further sanctions 
just as mikhail gorbachev in the soviet union has found that 
perestroika cannot be achieved in the twinkling of an eye and that 
serious attitudinal and institutional obstacles have to be 
confronted and gradually overcome so mr de klerk will have to 
confront difficulties of the same order said relly chairman of 
the anglo american corp 
the weekly mail an antiapartheid newspaper in jonhannesburg 
also likened de klerk to gorbachev saying both leaders were 
learning that the process of reform is not to direct change but 
to ease controls and wait for the unknowable to happen 
for de klerk this syndrome is most evident in his decision two 
weeks ago while acting president to allow mass protest marches 
tens of thousands of people of all races have joined antigovernment 
parades in major cities including militants displaying banners of 
the african national congress 
like gorbachev de klerk has a security establishment who 
prefer the old way of doing things said the weekly mail 
perhaps the biggest question if whether de klerk shares 
gorbachevs resolve and wile to outmaneuver the securocrats 
the centerpiece of de klerks program is a vague proposal to 
negotiate a new constitution that will extend political rights to 
the countrys 28 million blacks while protecting the 5 million 
whites from black domination 
in effect de klerk is suggesting that each racial group would 
have veto power over major policy decisions with deadlocks to be 
broken by some sort of independent arbitrator 
it is highly unlikely that even moderate black leaders let alone 
the anc would accept an outcome that falls so far short of a 
oneperson onevote system 
the anc released a statement friday night dismissing de klerks 
pledges of reform and calling for a continued armed struggle against 
the government 
the rhetoric mouthed by de klerk at his inauguration once more 
bears out our firm conviction that no white minority regime 
possesses either the will or the capacity to bring about a 
fundamental change of south africa said the statement released 
in lusaka zambia 
but blacks might be willing to sit down and talk if de klerk 
takes the preliminary steps they have demanded freeing mandela 
legalizing the anc lifting the emergency and curbs on political 
activity 
the most powerful black moderate zulu leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi said he was convinced de klerk intended to move forward 
he called on blacks to move away from the weak position of 
revolution and internal violence which can never bring victory for 
democracy and move toward the politics of negotiation 
an indication of the flux in south africa came last week in an 
editorial in the kenya times a newspaper published by kenyas 
ruling party that customarily depicts the white government in 
pretoria as evil and racist 
one still needs to avoid celebrating it said one needs 
time to see whether the de klerk government will make significant 
followups to these promising beginnings but if this is a sign 
of things to come then all of us need to encourage the president

finance officials of the worlds seven biggest 
economic powers met today amid renewed calls for the bush 
administration to curb the us budget deficit as its contribution 
toward stabilizing world currency markets 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady and federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan hosted the private talks at the blair house across 
the street from the white house with their counterparts from japan 
west germany great britain france canada and italy the 
socalled group of seven 
the finance ministers and central bankers from the seven nations 
were expected to discuss their seeming failure to stabilize world 
currency markets the dollar is trading above the targets they set 
despite a declaration at the officials last meeting in april 
seeking no further increase 
a strong dollar hurts us efforts to reduce its trade deficit 
because it raises the price of american exports overseas and makes 
foreign goods cheaper in the united states 
the dollars rise since the spring has come in the face of 
repeated and heavy selling by the g7 nations central banks in an 
effort to drive its value down 
in advance of the session the bush administration insisted 
coordination efforts had not broken down but officials of other 
nations said more was needed 
specifically the us must reduce the demand for dollars created 
by its budget deficit said a senior canadian official speaking to 
reporters on condition she not be identified by name 
one of the values of these meetings is peer pressure and the 
need to make the us repeatedly aware the administration and 
congress that the key to the imbalances problem is not some sort of 
exchange rate policy that brings down an overly strong dollar 
the best way to do that is a tighter fiscal policy the official 
said 
a senior official at the us treasury acknowledged we all 
recognize that more needs to be done the united states must 
reduce its budget deficit but said that nations with trade 
surpluses japan and west germany must stimulate consumer demand at 
home so they are less dependent on export sales 
the us official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said 
if the dollar were to continue its upswing for a lengthy period of 
time this obviously is a matter of concern because obviously 
we have more trade adjustments to accomplish 
despite the talk before todays meeting many private economists 
said they were expecting little more than vague rhetoric when the 
g7 issues a communique at the end of the session 
i would be shocked if anything really happened said michael 
k evans an economic consultant in washington but i think they 
will reiterate the fact that stable currencies are better and that 
they will work together to keep the fluctuations down without saying 
very much about where they should go 
trading in currency markets friday seemed to reflect that 
skepticism the dollar rose in thin erratic trading despite the 
fourth straight day of federal reserve dollar selling at the end of 
the day in new york the dollar rose to 14605 yen from 14565 on 
thursday 
the group of seven discussions were being held before the start 
of the annual meetings of the 152nation international monetary fund 
and its sister lending organization the world bank 
imf officials are pushing for a doubling of the funds resources 
to allow it to better handle the crushing 13 trillion third world 
debt burden a senior treasury official said friday the united 
states had not reached a conclusion that such an increase is needed

federal officials say fbi agents and coast 
guard officers found anarchy on hurricaneravaged st croix just 
hours after the virgin islands governor gave emphatic assurances 
the island was peaceful 
a coast guard helicopter crew that flew over the island wednesday 
morning to survey damage from hurricane hugo spotted bands of 
looters armed with machetes and guns a coast guard spokesman said 
basically there was total lawlessness from everything they 
saw said the spokesman lt cmdr jeff karonis 
a team of five fbi agents dispatched by attorney general dick 
thornburgh arrived about the same time and by wednesday afternoon 
reported that there had been a complete breakdown of law and 
order said an administration official 
the agents found roving bands of thugs looting shops and 
attacking homes the official said some 150 convicts who had 
escaped from two prisons were also on the loose 
until federal agents arrived wednesday morning it was difficult 
for officials in washington to get information because 
communications had been cut off with the stormravaged island 
the accounts of fbi agents and the coast guard conflicted starkly 
with the report the pentagon received from gov alexander farrelly 
on tuesday night 
the governor emphatically stated there was no lawandorder 
problem and matters we well in hand said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the governors statement was also at odds with a plea made over 
ham radio earlier tuesday night by an assistant us attorney on st 
croix who expressed fear that looting convicts might exact revenge 
on law enforcement officers and judges the official said 
the prosecutors report was the basis for attorney general dick 
thornburghs decision to send in the team of five fbi agents to 
survey the situation the official said 
as that team was arriving in st croix on wednesday morning the 
justice department established contact with the us marshal for the 
virgin islands who reported that there was anarchy it was very 
serious situation the official said 
as the picture of violence and lawlessness became more detailed 
pentagon officials went to the justice department to develop 
contingency plans for dealing with the situation 
after consulting with the white house thornburgh decided to send 
the fbis hostage rescue team and the us marshals services 
special operations group to st croix to protect federal officials 
and property 
at 2 pm or 230 pm wednesday farrelly met with the senior 
fbi agent in the virgin islands and requested a battalion of 
military police to help restore order said the official 
a presidential proclamation was quickly drafted at the justice 
department and orders were issued to send in military police to 
restore order farrellys request was reported to the white house by 
the federal emergency management agency 
but the presidential order was based on a law that allows the 
chief executive to send in troops without a governors request 
president bush was relying on his own judgment based on other 
reports that it was important to restore law and order the 
official said 
the decision to send in troops was made after federal 
authorities on the scene were reporting chaos and near anarchy and 
the situation as being out of control admiral william crowe jr 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said last week in an 
interview 
later wednesday afternoon farrelly publicly denied that he had 
asked for troops during interviews thursday the governor said 
reports of lawlessness and looting were exaggerated 
he made the comments after 1100 us troops and 100 fbi and 
deputy us marshals had arrived in st croix 
by friday farrelly had ceded all law enforcement power to the 
justice department which now has comprehensive authority to make 
arrests and conduct prosecutions for violations of both federal and 
territorial law

improved ussoviet relations along with other 
factors offer the rare prospect of a decline in worldwide military 
spending according to a new study released saturday 
in many respects the decade of the 1980s is ending on a more 
hopeful note than it had at the start says the study world 
military and social expenditures 1989 
the report was written by ruth sivard a former official of the 
us arms control and disarmament agency each year she publishes an 
updated version of global military spending and how it compares with 
spending on human resources 
her principle thesis is that defense spending absorbs funds 
desperately needed for social programs 
ms sivard writes that the positive trends at the end of the 
decade have not as yet had a measureable impact on government 
budgets and that world military spending is still at record levels 
nonetheless ms sivard cites as causes for optimism the 
superpower rapprochement the winding down of wars in afghanistan 
central america southern africa and southeast asia and the revival 
of the united nations role as a peacemaker 
the report also notes that china the soviet union and vietnam 
countries which large military establishments all have undertaken 
personnel cutbacks beyond that she says no new wars started over 
the past year for the first time in 31 years 
still in real terms military expenditures have continued to 
rise with the expansion of the global economy and may have reached 
the 1 trillion mark worldwide for the first time last year the 
report says 
in 1986 the last year for which complete figures are available 
the united states spent about 281 billion on defense and the soviet 
union 271 billion accounting for about 62 per cent of global 
military spending the report says 
it adds the global obsession with military force since world 
war ii has produced hundreds of millions of casualties not only 
from war but from neglect of urgent human needs 
as an example the study cites the appalling number of lives 
lost to hunger and to other killerdiseases that are preventable at 
the cost of a few dollars for an individual life 
the study also makes these obsevations 
six times as much public research money goes for research on 
weapons as for research on health protection 
every minute 15 children in the world die for want of essential 
food and inexpensive vaccines and the world military machine takes 
19 million from the public treasury 
the chances of dying from social neglect are 33 times greater 
than the chances of dying in war 
in the developing world there is one soldier per 240 
inhabitants one physician per 1950 
the us and the ussr the top ranking military powers rank 
17th and 45th among all nations in infant mortality rates 
since 1960 developing countries have increased military 
expenditures more than twice as fast as living standards measured 
by per capita income

advocates for the mentally retarded hope a 
judge has set an example for others around the country by ordering 
pennsylvania officials to seek money to restore services for 
retarded philadelphians who live at home 
this decision is the first in the nation holding that people 
with retardation have a right to those services said david 
ferleger attorney for an advocacy group that joined the city in 
seeking the state money 
the decision also marks the beginning of a move to state courts 
instead of federal court where ferlegers group the philadelphia 
police and fire association for handicapped children lost earlier 
this year in a similar case 
commonwealth court judge james crumlish jr last week gave the 
pennsylvania department of public welfare until oct 2 to ask the 
legislature to provide the 756 million needed for services that 
had been cut or canceled for up to 7750 mentally retarded 
philadelphians 
the order does not cover the legislature but ferleger said if 
the lawmakers turn down the request he would ask the judge to order 
the department to find the funds elsewhere in its budget 
the judge ruled that state officials breached their 
responsibility under state law to assure adequate mental 
retardation services for all persons who need them 
crumlishs opinion took state officials to task for failing to 
evaluate the needs of philadelphias mentally retarded in coming up 
with a budget instead the state just added a little more to what 
had been budgeted before whether that previous amount met actual 
needs 
the ruling dealt only with the states handling of one county 
but that thing will be widely disseminated said allan 
bergman deputy director for governmental activities for the united 
cerebral palsy associations 
i would suggest there are other parties in other states where 
they have similar grounds under their state laws bergman said 
very few states base their budgets on actual client need that 
issue will be true everywhere ferleger said 
a 1987 survey by the association for retarded citizens found 
76000 people waiting for day programs around the country 
richard gold deputy city solicitor for philadelphia isnt 
convinced of a national effect of crumlishs ruling our lawsuit 
is under state law he said simply 
however state law is becoming the chosen legal strategy as 
groups push for services to keep people out of institutions 
integrate them into society and help them do things for themselves 
the move to state courts began with a us supreme court decision 
in february that held the state of wisconsin did not have a 
constitutional duty to protect a boy who suffered brain damage from 
repeated beatings by his father 
ferlegers group won an initial victory in federal court on 
rights for the retarded to community services under the us 
constitution but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reversed the 
case citing the wisconsin ruling as grounds 
in new jersey the state public advocate has sued the state 
department of human services in state court contending the agency 
wasnt providing appropriate community services to about 3300 
people 
in recent years the federal constitution has been interpreted 
increasingly narrowly on disabilities issues and some of the state 
constitutions have been providing greater protection said linda 
headley an attorney for the public advocate 
advocates like to see efforts succeed in other states 
its always important that some other judge somewhere else was 
willing to do this said robert fleischner attorney for the 
center for public representation in northampton mass 
tannis fox attorney for the arizona center for law in the public 
interest said her group won a ruling by the arizona supreme court 
that state law required community treatment for the chronically 
mentally ill 
a national solution could come from outside the courts 
the senate finance committee in the next two weeks may consider a 
bill sponsored by sen john chafee rri and cosponsored by 53 
others that would eventually make such services a federal right 
the way congress mandated in 1975 that disabled children have a 
right to go to school

the copilot of the usair jet that crashed into 
the east river was making his first takeoff in a passengercarrying 
boeing 737400 when he mistakenly pushed a button that cut the 
throttle investigators said 
the pilot tried to remedy the error by increasing engine thrust 
manually but then decided to abort the takeoff james kohlstad 
acting administrator of the national transportation safety board 
said at a news conference friday night 
also friday authorities suspended the pilots and copilots 
flight licenses for leaving the scene of the crash 
two passengers died when the charlotte ncbound plane skidded 
off the end of laguardia airport runway wednesday night 
though he described the mistake by copilot constantine kleissaf 
29 and detailed his lack of experience on that model of aircraft 
kohlstad didnt explicitly blame pilot error for the crash or say if 
investigators had pinpointed the cause 
the copilot was in charge of the highly computerized controls 
when he mistakenly pushed the autothrottle disconnect button as 
the aircraft was rolling down the runway kohlstad said 
the automatic throttles are programmed by the flight crew the 
button kleissaf should have pushed would have accelerated the plane 
automatically to a preset speed for takeoff he said 
as the plane continued down the runway the pilot 36yearold 
michael martin jumped in to try to increase the throttle manually 
kohlstad said 
the plane started drifting to the left and the pilot felt and 
heard a vibration which concerned him and then cut power to abort 
the takeoff kohlstad said 
the pilots also failed to call out the jetliners speed as it 
rolled down the runway as required kohlstad said it was clearly 
a lack of proper procedure being followed in the cockpit he said 
kleissaf had controlled takeoffs in 737400s in training 
kohlstad said but had never taken off in that model plane with 
passengers aboard 
martin has been a captain since july 1 and had flown only 138 
hours in that capacity on the 737400 the new york times reported 
saturday he had about 4000 hours on all models of 737s mostly as 
a copilot the paper said quoting unnamed government and industry 
sources 
faa records show kleissaf received his commercial pilots license 
in october 1987 and an instructors license six months later his 
faa record is clean said faa spokesman bob hoppers in oklahoma 
city okla 
investigators questioned martin and kleissaf separately for five 
hours friday both men later submitted to urine tests for drug and 
alcohol but the results werent immediately available kohlstad 
said 
the federal aviation administration friday suspended martins and 
kleissafs flight licenses because they left the scene after the 
crash and could not be questioned immediately by investigators faa 
administrator james b busey said he called their conduct highly 
questionable 
at his news conference kohlstad also criticized the pair for not 
volunteering for alcohol and drug tests earlier 
the provision of urine samples and no blood samples almost two 
days after this accident seriously impedes our investigation and 
unnecessarily creates an environment of suspicion he said 
nevertheless kohlstad noted that martin and kleissaf helped 
passengers out of the plane after the crash and that airline 
regulations didnt require them to remain at the scene 
he also said both pilots went to a hospital for treatment 
thursday which partly explained their absence 
immediately after the crash martin took a rescue boat to the 
airport and then a taxi to a nearby hotel where he called his union 
representative kohlstad said 
the air line pilots association issued a statement friday 
defending the crew there was nothing unusual in the crews 
performance no federal rules were broken and the crew has 
cooperated completely with the investigation it said 
martin tried to check into a hotel as ordered by usair and when 
he couldnt get a room went to the home of another pilot to rest 
the union said adding that he stayed in touch with usair officials 
but usair spokesman dave shipley denied that 
he did not contact us and we did not tell him to go to the 
hotel shipley said 
the copilot was quoted after the crash as saying the pilot was 
incoherent before the flight but kohlstad said other crew members 
hadnt noticed anything unusual in his behavior kleissaf has 
apologized for his remarks the investigator said 
workers on friday began removing the partially submerged 
aircraft which cracked into three pieces from the water 
the plane had been delivered in january and had no history of 
mechanical problems said airline spokeswoman nancy vaughan

a mural project sponsored by an antiaids group to 
remind drug users to avoid sharing needles has run into trouble with 
denvers beautification campaign the problem the murals look a 
lot like graffiti 
businesses and city officials are complaining about the 
university of colorado health sciences center effort called project 
safe it involved asking local artists to paint murals in three 
drugridden neighborhoods to provide aids warnings such as dont 
share use bleach 
to appeal to their intended audience the statefunded artists 
spray painted their messages in bold colors making it look like 
the graffiti the city is trying to wipe out in the same 
neighborhoods 
we are looking at some other ways of getting that message 
across rather than using walls said valeria purser of the keep 
denver beautiful antigraffiti campaign 
to sanction any type of graffiti murals would be detrimental to 
the campaign said purser 
but the message has to reach those whose lifestyles make them 
susceptible to aids said jean finn a spokeswoman for the state 
health departments division for sexually transmitted diseases 
which helped with the project 
at this point were just trying to figure out the value and 
effectiveness of the murals and take into consideration the 
concerns in the areas they have voiced said finn 
the mural campaign resulted from suggestions by prostitutes and 
intravenous drug abusers at the denver jail said stephanie marusich 
of the health department the inmates were brought together in a 
focus group a sort of bull session of the type used by 
advertising people to learn about the preferences of average 
citizens 
youve got to reach people on the street in a way theyre going 
to respond and recognize ms marusich said were trying to 
reach our audience first of all the appropriate audience with 
the appropriate message 
information about aids transmission must reach people who live in 
a very different way she said 
were talking about drug dens with blood sprayed on the 
ceiling where people stay in the dark shoot their drugs and really 
try and shut out the outside world she said weve been inside 
shooting galleries to get a real good feel for what is happening 
tom gleason an aide to mayor federico pena said the projects 
intentions are good but the method is not 
in our experience anything that resembles graffiti attracts 
more graffiti he said obviously their goal is an important 
one 
the five points business association in a lower middleclass 
neighborhood is objecting to one of the murals 
were addressing a letter to the governor said association 
president sarah foster we do not want that kind of a mural in our 
area we are trying to clean it up 
foster said the money for the murals about 1500 from a state 
health department grant would have been spent better on other forms 
of education 
purser said the money private landowners businesses and the city 
have invested in such neighborhoods as five points could be 
jeopardized by the murals 
were trying to revitalize she said then you have this 
huge sign right there in the middle of it as a developer youre 
saying why is this graffititype drug message there 
alternatives such as ordinary signs plywood panels attached to 
buildings and bench advertisements are being considered purser said 
marusich said the group hopes to produce several murals in some 
form every three or four months 
the point is there is drugs in five points she said there 
are people who are becoming infected and infecting others 
the most rapid spread of aids at this point in the epidemic 
involves the sharing of contaminated needles or syringes by drug 
abusers and subsequent sexual contact involving those infected 
through drug use federal officials said at the end of june that 
intravenous drug abusers made up 23 percent of the more than 100000 
cases of aids in the united states

for three decades nasa has launched 
unmanned rockets from this spaceport more than 400 of them on 
monday it plans to fire its last one here closing an illustrious 
chapter in american space history 
the fiery finale will be staged by an atlascentaur rocket which 
is to blast off at 412 am with a military communications 
satellite to link land sea and air forces around the world with the 
joint chiefs of staff the national command authority and the 
president 
once the atlascentaur is gone nasas only launch vehicle at 
cape canaveral will be the manned space shuttle when the agency has 
a need for an expendable rocket it will have to buy the launch 
services from private industry 
in the past nasa has purchased unmanned boosters from companies 
such as general dynamics and mcdonnell douglas and used its own 
crews to launch them in the future crews from private companies 
will conduct the countdowns at the cape as the nations budding 
commercial launch industry takes off 
the space agency stopped buying atlascentaur delta and other 
space boosters early in the 1980s opting instead to launch all its 
payloads from the space shuttle 
officials admitted that was a mistake after the shuttle 
challenger exploded in 1986 following the explosion thenpresident 
reagan directed nasa to get out of the business of launching 
commercial payloads opening the way for rocket companies to start a 
new enterprise 
a backlog of government payloads and a desire to keep space 
business from being sent abroad to france china or even the soviet 
union spurred the policy change 
after the launch of the last atlascentaur the agency will have 
one large unmanned rocket left a delta that is to lift a scientific 
satellite from vandenberg air force base calif in november and 
the government will continue to launch military space rockets from 
vandenberg and the cape 
still mondays launch is a milestone for cape canaveral where 
nasa got its start and where it has launched more than 95 percent of 
its boosters 
its always sad to see the end of an era said james l 
womack nasas director of expendable launch vehicles who will be 
in the launch control center monday 
theres a certain element of sadness but the things we have 
done have been fabulous said joseph mahon the agencys assistant 
administrator for space flight 
among the achievements the mariner viking pioneer and voyager 
missions to the planets 42 weather satellites the ranger surveyor 
and lunar orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of 
american astronauts landing there 94 communications satellites 
scores of scientific payloads dozens of unmanned test launches for 
the mercury gemini and apollo maninspace projects 
nasas first launch vehicle was a thor able that lifted off oct 
11 1958 propelling the pioneer 1 probe toward a flyby of the moon 
it failed as did four more rockets before a juno 2 hurled pioneer 3 
within 37300 miles of the moon and into orbit around the sun on 
march 3 1959 
three more failures followed before the successful launch of 
explorer 6 a radiationstudy satellite on aug 7 1959 
other failures followed but the national aeronautics and space 
administrations overall success rate stands at more than 90 percent 
of 447 launches 
in recent years the burden has been borne by two workhorse 
rockets the atlascentaur which will be making its 68th appearance 
on monday and the delta with 184 liftoffs both have a success 
rate of more than 95 percent 
nasa has ordered launch services starting next year from general 
dynamics for four atlascentaurs to boost three weather satellites 
and a sunstudying payload and the agency plans to use three titan 
rockets launched by martin marietta to hoist planetary probes in the 
1990s 
the change involves no layoffs since private contractors already 
filled many of the ranks of nasas launch teams and some personnel 
are being shifted to the shuttle or other space agency programs

police arrested more than 150 
people clashed with angry blacks and cordoned off a cathedral with 
barbed wire saturday in a massive operation to stop a march by

mandela at a trade union office after the march was canceled 
police said three people were injured but gave no details 
mrs mandela wife of imprisoned african national congress leader

to assemble there 
its been a great success for the government he said 
roadblocks as far back as soweto a black township an hours drive 
away barbed wire security vehicles the government has made its 
point 
a notice tacked to a church door said the government had obtained 
a court order banning a premarch service and the march itself two

another demanded the hanging of nelson mandela and freedom for 
barend strydom a white expoliceman sentenced to death for killing 
seven blacks in a shooting spree in pretoria last year

british prime minister margaret thatcher predicted 
saturday that president mikhail s gorbachevs sweeping reform 
agenda will ultimately triumph over the current wave of domestic 
unrest 
i believe perestroika is now set on its course and will go 
through to success the british leader told a news conference 
following four hours of meetings with gorbachev 
mrs thatcher was on a oneday stopover between tokyo and london 
the meeting which mrs thatcher termed a milestone was 
the fifth between the two leaders since gorbachev was named 
communist party chief in 1985 mrs thatcher also was guest at a 
luncheon hosted by gorbachev and his wife raisa 
the british prime minister was the first major western leader to 
see gorbachev since this summers wave of strikes by miners in the 
ukraine and siberia and deadly flareups of ethnic violence in 
georgia uzbekistan and kazakhstan 
in her remarks to reporters she expressed great confidence in 
the 58yearold kremlin leader and his program for economic and 
social reform saying it opens up vistas and horizons not 
available to the people of the soviet union for some 70 years 
asked about current domestic woes faced by gorbachevs reform 
drive she replied that anything bold and purposeful will have 
difficulties to it 
mrs thatchers remarks amounted to a vote of confidence in 
gorbachev from a western leader regarded by many soviets as 
hardheaded practical and not at all favorably disposed to communism 
one of the topics discussed by the two leaders was arms control 
and mrs thatcher said she had been in touch with president bush 
on the matter before meeting with gorbachev at st catherines hall 
in the kremlin 
however she declined to comment on anything gorbachev may have 
told her on a dramatic swing in the soviet position on a superpower 
treaty now being negotiated to slash longrange nuclear weapons 
arsenals 
at jackson hole wyo where soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and us secretary of state james a baker iii met 
us officials said friday the soviets had dropped demands that a 
treaty be concluded to limit spacebased defenses before a separate 
pact to slash longrange bombers missiles and nuclear submarines 
since the united states had refused to yield to soviet demands to 
trim its star wars spacedefense program a superpower treaty to 
reduce strategic weapons by 30 to 50 percent had seemed improbable 
asked whether gorbachev had mentioned the switch in the soviet 
bargaining position mrs thatcher told reporters gathered at the 
soviet foreign ministry press room that any announcement on the 
subject should be made in the united states 
the official soviet news agency tass said only that 
information had been exchanged on new developments in superpower 
arms negotiations 
on other disarmament topics mrs thatcher said she left her 
meeting with gorbachev believing that east and west can reach an 
agreement reducing coventional weaponry in europe by next year she 
also said prospects were encouraging for a ban on chemical 
weapons 
before the leaders met tass said soviet concerns in the talks 
would include mrs thatchers support for western plans to modernize 
shortrange nuclear weapons it said the soviet side also would 
raise questions about european plans for a single market in 1992 
cooperation on ecological problems and economic joint ventures 
mrs thatcher did not directly address those issues at her 
halfhour news conference tass said only that the issue of tactical 
nuclear weapons in europe had not been skirted 
the british leaders personal relationship with gorbachev is 
warm even though she retains a watchful eye on soviet military 
power relations between london and moscow slid in may when the 
british expelled 11 soviet journalists and diplomats on allegations 
of spying and the soviets retaliated by expelling 11 britons 
but tass said that in soviet diplomatic circles it is believed 
that these differences should not be viewed as an obstacle to the 
development of relations between the two nations

a soviet music student who disappeared before 
a performance by a leningrad state conservatory troupe at towson 
state university apparently is seeking to defect school and soviet 
officials said 
the 19yearold musician was reported to be at an undisclosed 
immigration and naturalization service site friday towson state 
spokesman dan mccarthy said saturday 
the state department has confirmed that he is at some location 
and that is the only fact we know for certain towson state 
president hoke l smith said 
ins and state department officials do not comment on cases 
involving political asylum officials from both agencies said 
saturday 
the student pyotr zaytsev 19 was one of 20 students and 10 
faculty members from the leningrad state conservatory who arrived in 
maryland on tuesday the group is scheduled to leave thursday 
zaytsev failed to show up friday morning to board a bus that was 
to take him from a hotel to the school soviet and school officials 
filed a missing person report and were informed later friday of 
zaytsevs status mccarthy said 
the vice president of the leningrad state conservatory gintas 
zhalvys said through an interpreter that no decision had been made 
whether to leave without zaytsev 
pyotr has to think it over appraise the situation and make up 
his mind zhalvys said 
zaytsev plays the balalaika a triangular stringed instrument 
played like a guitar mccarthy said zhalvys said a scheduled 
performance was held as planned friday and the remainder of the 
groups schedule would not change 
this boy had a very small part in our program so it was very 
easy to substitute that part zhalvys said we came here to meet 
our friends and share the warmth of our hearts but we never 
intended to impose on them in this way

hawaiian authorities besieged by epidemic use of 
a smokable crystalline form of the illegal drug methamphetamine have 
a warning for police on the mainland highly addictive ice is 
heading their way 
were not trying to glamorize this drug nor are we proud that 
its hit hawaii first but we need to alert law enforcement people 
everywhere and prepare them to handle it said maj mike carvalho 
of the honolulu police departments narcotics division 
since 1985 there have been 32 deaths related to the crystal meth 
in honolulu including 12 in the first six months of 1989 according 
to medical examiner mary flynn they included eight homicides and 
seven suicides in which the victims had crystal meth in their 
systems she said 
the drug causes symptoms of psychosis and many users are 
misdiagnosed as mentally ill especially schizophrenic 
this drug makes people bananas people become violent they 
kill themselves drive crazy pick fights she said and we just 
know about the victims who knows what the assailants were on 
since sept 5 when drug czar william bennett unveiled a national 
antidrug plan nearly 50 us agencies have requested background on 
crystal meth carvalho said 
last week we had a video conference projected to 600 precincts 
in texas during roll call carvalho said we had slides on what 
it looks like the effects what symptoms to look for and how its 
being packaged and smoked 
although labs making methamphetamine also known as speed or 
crank in its common powdered form are busted in california every 
year the crystals smoked here come mainly from asia carvalho said 
some mainland authorities familiar with meth dont even recognize 
the crystalline form which looks like rock salt or candy he said 
crystal meth is already turning up all along the west coast as 
well as arizona texas and florida he said 
the crystalline form also is known as ice crystals or 
batu it has been smoked here for at least a decade by a small 
number of asian immigrants but surged to widespread use about two 
years ago he said 
so far this year about 400 people have been investigated for the 
possession or sale of crystal meth described as cheaper than 
cocaine with a longer high than the smokable crack form of 
cocaine and more addictive than heroin 
thats really the crux of the epidemic said dr joseph 
giannasio medical director of castle medical centers alcohol and 
addictions program anytime you can get a drug that causes a very 
rapid high in a high dosage without having to use a needle its 
going to be a lot more popular 
ice smokers get an energizing high than can last 14 hours 
compared with about 15 minutes for crack but the psychological 
crash is much worse and can last for days or until the next smoke 
giannasio said 
a recent study by the national institute on drug abuse called use 
here epidemic 
although no one can say for sure how many people here smoke ice 
about 700 people required emergency treatment in the past six months 
after using it 
ironically many users switched from crack to crystal meth 
because they considered it safer instead they found themselves 
addicted from practically the first smoke giannasio said 
the typical user turns into a paranoid person who goes days 
without sleep loses weight is very suspicious that people are out 
to get him they feel like theyre going crazy giannasio said 
but thats not how it starts out at first when they use the drug 
they feel extremely alert like they can accomplish anything 
the drug can also be fatal leading to strokes heart attacks and 
pulmonary edema which means victims drown in their own bodily 
fluids he said 
police maj david benson head of the juvenile crime division 
said filipino youth gangs control distribution of ice here 
the gangs are heavily armed and violence has escalated recently 
as rival gangs and even factions of the same group compete for 
control of the drug it is commonly sold in papers containing 
one hit or about a tenth of a gram for 50 
were just getting the tip of the iceberg he said this 
stuff is as bad as crack and if it explodes on the national scene 
without the police being prepared were just going to have more 
violence more addicts and more dead

family members on saturday grieved for their 
slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the 
royal marines music school where an ira terrorist attack killed 10 
military musicians 
jean cleatheroe whose son andrew was killed joined local 
residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of 
private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other 
military establishments in britain 
the security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal we had 
seen it for ourselves we have always said how easy it would be for 
anyone to get in what could ordinary security men do to stop 
terrorists she said 
british military installations are a frequent target of the iras 
campaign to end british rule in northern ireland and unite the 
predominantly protestant province with the mainly roman catholic 
republic of ireland 
fridays attack was the worst since july 1982 when 11 servicemen 
were fatally wounded in bombings in central london 
shocked residents of deal gathered outside the barracks to lay 
flowers in tribute to the young men they called the bandies 
an 11yearold royal marines cadet in full dress uniform marched 
to the barracks and smartly saluted the royal marines sign 
im proud of my uniform and im proud of all the marines i 
knew i hate the people who did this to them said scott roberts 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual leader of the 
church of england visited the injured and said he was impressed 
by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat 
them 
runcie said one of the mens main concerns was that their hands 
would heal properly so they could continue playing their musical 
instruments 
police investigating the attack were searching a nearby house 
that had been rented briefly by three men with irish accents 
we know when the men arrived and when they left cmdr george 
churchillcoleman head of scotland yards antiterrorist squad 
said at a news conference it appears the men left several days 
before the explosion 
he said the house which overlooks the barracks recreation center 
destroyed by the friday morning blast was rented by its english 
owners to three men for two to three weeks 
there was no proof the house was an ira hideout the commander 
said 
by virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and 
the men are irish we are very anxious to talk to them he said 
explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were 
painstakingly examining the house saturday and churchillcoleman 
said they would continue for the next two or three days 
police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break between 
morning band practices were servicemen of 22 men injured 12 
remained hospitalized saturday five in serious condition 
the irish republican army on friday claimed responsibility for 
the explosion which also severely damaged several nearby houses 
police have not determined what caused the blast but 
churchillcoleman said it would seem to be some form of 
improvised device using high explosives the ira did not specify 
how it caused the blast

in washington where some people still speak of 
simplicity and tax law in the same sentence and 100000 is 
described as middle income theyve just discovered a new tax 
outrage they call it the bubble 
heres what it means if the president whos paid 200000 and 
your bachelor governor with no income except an 85000 salary win 
1000 each in the lottery the president must pay 280 in tax on 
that additional income and the governor must pay 330 
to house speaker thomas s foley dwash the bubble is a 
distortion it is totally topsyturvy upside down of everything 
that we have ever considered fair reasonable tax policy 
americans have grown up with the notion that the more you make 
the greater portion of each dollar you pay in tax the strippeddown 
taxrate structure enacted in 1986 conflicts with that tradition 
draw a bar graph of traditional income tax rates and you see a 
series of stairsteps leading upward but the new law has three steps 
up and then for the really highincome earners one step down 
that step down is the bubble which benefits the nations 
richest 600000 couples and individuals 
the quirk is at the heart of a steaming tax battle between 
congressional democrats and president bush 
as part of their plan to kill bushs proposed capitalgains tax 
cut foley and fellow democratic leaders in the house are trying to 
burst the bubble eliminating it would take more taxes from the 
wealthiest and use the money to allow deductible individual 
retirement accounts for all workers and to cut the budget deficit 
heres what the bubble is all about 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the tax law now has three tax rates 15 percent 28 percent and 
33 percent every taxpayer pays the lowest rate for about 80 
percent of americans it is the only rate they pay every taxable 
dollar they earn is taxed at a rate of 15 percent 
for a single person the bottom rate applies to all taxable 
income what is left after deductions and personal exemptions are 
subtracted up to 18550 for a couple filing a joint return the 
15 percent bracket covers taxable income up to 30950 
suppose jill lunchbucket has taxable income of 18000 and gets a 
1000 pay raise step 2 of the rate structure comes into play the 
first 18550 is taxed at 15 percent and the additional 450 is 
taxed at 28 percent 
jill has moved up into the 28 percent marginal tax bracket 
meaning that any additional income another pay raise winning a 
football pool or interest on a new savings account will be taxed 
at 28 percent 
suppose shes elected football commissioner and gets a 70000 
raise assuming she has no extra deductions that pushes her taxable 
income to 89000 and produces this tax picture 
18550 is taxed at 15 percent resulting in 278250 in tax 
the next 26350 is taxed at 28 percent or 7378 
the remaining 44900 is taxed at 33 percent or 14553 
that means a total tax of 2471350 
the bubble does not affect jill because her taxable income is 
under the 93130 level at which it comes into play 
but consider jack bigbucks who also is single makes 500000 a 
year and has taxable income of 400000 he has to figure his taxes 
differently 
that is because congressional taxwriters in crafting the 1986 
overhaul decreed that singles with taxable incomes above 93130 
and couples above 155320 with no dependents pay a flat 28 percent 
rate on every penny of taxable income also the very rich get no 
tax benefit from personal exemptions 
so for jack 
the entire 400000 is taxed at 28 percent for a tax of 
112000 
losing the tax saving from his 2000 personal exemption adds 
560 28 percent of 2000 to his tax bill 
that gives jack a tax liability of 112560 
the democrats want to remove that bubble prevent the 33 
percent rate from dropping back to 28 percent they would tax all of 
jacks taxable income over 44900 at 33 percent that would mean 
18550 taxed at 15 percent a tax of 278250 
the next 26350 taxed at 28 percent or 7378 
the remaining 355100 taxed at 33 percent or 117183 
jack would have a total tax bill of 12734350 or 1478350 
more than under present law

lake for sale some maintenance 
required best offer 
its not your average auction but on monday hoosac lake goes on 
the block as lawyers try to liquidate the last remaining and 
already fairly liquid asset of a defunct printing works and 
shorefront residents are not eager to see it fall into the hands of 
a developer 
were selling this thing as is where is whatever we have you 
get said joseph h reinhardt a lawyer with the springfield firm 
handling the sale the last item in an 8yearold bankruptcy case 
involving the defunct arnold print works 
part of hoosacs shoreline runs through the berkshires town of 
cheshire and residents there are worried 
our concern is if it is a private buyer what does he have in 
mind for us said raymond fisher chairman of the hoosac lake 
committee its what people in the big cities like new york and 
boston and los angeles dream about its very picturesque quiet 
arcadian 
despite its scenic qualities town officials say the lake would 
be a bad buy because of the costs of weeding expected to be 31000 
this year and because it includes an aging 120yearold dam 
fisher said he hopes mondays auction will be a flop proving the 
lake doesnt have commercial potential and possibly opening the door 
for its donation to the town or state 
i personally dont think anyones going to be interested 
said selectman frank polastri the town doesnt plan to make a bid 
but all of us are going to be there he said 
cheshire had been paying 750 a year for an annual lease to use 
the lake polastri said 
what the town would do after the sale is anybodys guess at 
this point he said 
about five years ago the state offered about 115000 for the 
566acre lake but was unable to reach an agreement on price said 
state sen peter webber with the state in a budget crisis the 
money isnt there this year he said 
reinhardt says the property which includes about 50 acres of 
land might be good for someone who wants to build a resort 
the lake dates to the 1860s when manufacturers banded together 
to buy land dam the hoosac river and create water power for their 
mills 
in 1912 the hoosac reservoir co was formed to oversee management 
of the water arnold print works was the last remaining shareholder 
of that company reinhardt said principals of the company are no 
longer involved in the case he said 
terms of the auction will be outlined monday but the auctioneer 
has announced that a 25000 deposit is required reinhardt said 
i have no idea what were going to sell it for he said 
a sale would be subject to approval by the us bankruptcy court 
in worcester and any proceeds would be divided among unsecured 
creditors of the print works

just how pablo picasso and his lesserknown 
friend georges braque invented cubism eight decades ago is the topic 
of a major exhibit opening sunday at the museum of modern art 
the show described by the museum as the first attempt to examine 
cubism through an indepth concentration on its core deals with 
the artists work between 1907 and 1914 
during the cubist years both artists were at their best when 
they were closest to one another exhibition organizer william 
rubin writes in the catalog cubism as we know it was a vision 
that neither artist could have realized alone 
a new york times critic described the exhibit as the show of 
the decade 
the exhibition consists of 390 works including paintings 
drawings prints sculptures and collages they were borrowed from 
museums and collections all over the united states and europe and 
from the soviet union 
the frenchborn braque lived from 1882 to 1963 picasso a native 
of spain who spent most of his life in france lived from 1881 to 
1973 they were colleagues in paris at the time they developed the 
abstract style known as cubism in the early years of the century

finance officials of the nations seven largest 
industrial nations gathered saturday amid growing evidence their 
efforts to stabilize world currency markets have become ineffective 
in their first meeting since april the officials of the group of 
seven the united states japan west germany great britain 
france canada and italy are reviewing this years rise in the 
value of the dollar which is endangering the improvement in the 
american trade deficit 
a strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price of 
us goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaper 
for american consumers the trade gap shrank by 22 percent last year 
and has continued to improve this year although at only about half 
of 1988s rate 
when the finance officials and central bank governors of the 
seven nations last met they agreed to try to curb a further 
increase in the dollar theyve backed the rhetoric with heavy 
intervention in currency markets the process in which central banks 
buy and sell dollars in an attempt to influence dollar prices 
but even though the central banks have sold billions the price 
of the dollar continued to rise analysts say intervention is 
becoming less effective because government sales amount to an 
increasingly smaller fraction of the mushrooming volume of daily 
currency trading 
since the last g7 meeting the dollar has appreciated by about 
10 percent against the japanese yen and 3 percent against the west 
german mark the dollar on friday bought 146 yen and 195 marks 
well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading 
range sought by the group of seven 140 yen and 190 marks 
in advance of saturdays meeting conducted in private analysts 
were expecting the g7 to do little more than issue a vague 
communique expressing concern about the dollars strength 
however economists were holding out the possibility that the 
united states japan and germany may show more willingness in the 
months ahead to raise or lower interest rates as a means of 
influencing exchange markets 
an increase in japanese and west german interest rates would make 
investing in those countries more attractive and would thus raise 
the value of their currencies a cut in interest rates in the united 
states would push the dollar lower 
the fact of the matter is intervention does not work in the 
long run said economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill the only 
longterm solution really is to change monetary policy 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york speculated that the japanese and west 
german officials would agree at saturdays meeting to raise their 
interest rates if the dollar threatened to rise above 200 marks and 
150 yen 
there is also the possibility and id underscore the word 
possibility of fed loosening in the fourth quarter he said 
i think the g7 is going to speak softly but carry a big stick on 
the dollar this time 
in addition to the narrow question of exhange rates finance 
officials were expected to discuss the broader issue of economic 
coordination the united states has been pressing west germany and 
japan to stimulate consumer demand in their countries as a means of 
cutting their trade surpluses and reducing the us deficit the 
united states in turn is being urged to reignite efforts to curb 
its budget deficit which is believed to contribute to the trade 
deficit 
the third world debt problem was also expected to be discussed by 
the officials treasury secretary nicholas f brady who hosted the 
g7 meeting with federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan has 
been promoting a new strategy to relieve developing nations of their 
crushing 13 trillion debt burden 
however the decision by three large us banks last week to add 
4 billion to their loss reserves for third world debt is raising 
concern that the banks will be unwilling to make the new loans 
needed by developing countries for economic growth 
the group of seven talks were being held before the start of the 
annual meetings this week of the 152nation international monetary 
fund and its sister lending organization the world bank 
the finance ministers and central banks governors arrived in 
limousines at the blair house across the street from the white 
house before lunch the g7 session was preceded by a group of five 
meeting the g7 excluding canada and italy at the treasury 
brady met oneonone with ryutaro hashimoto the new japanese 
minister of finance and pierre beregovoy the french finance 
minister it was bradys first meeting with hashimoto

guerrilla forces have seized 
territory surrounding a gemrich western town taking advantage of 
vietnams troop withdrawal from cambodia the defense minister said 
saturday 
it is the first government acknowledgment that the resistance has 
captured territory in a battle seen as a crucial test of the 
cambodian army which is fighting for once without vietnamese troop 
support 
gen tea banh also said that less than 20000 government soldiers 
have been killed or wounded since january 1979 when vietnam invaded 
and installed cambodias present government 
i am speaking to you frankly we do not claim that we control 
all of pailin the general said of the rubyrich town near the 
thai border 
cambodias ruby mines are centered in a 16squaremile area near 
pailin the general said khmer rouge troops have seized parts of the 
mining center 
a soviet military observer said the cambodian government and 
khmer rouge guerrillas have thrown their best troops into the battle 
for pailin 
he said fighting was fierce and most residents had fled or been 
evacuated the observer who requested anonymity spoke in russian 
to an east european reporter who made his comments available to the 
associated press 
tea banh told a news conference that soldiers are exchanging 
mostly mortar and artillery shells 
but he said the fighting is not a serious security threat to the 
government which has been supported by vietnamese troops since the 
invasion that ended a bloody reign of terror by the communist khmer 
rouge 
only some parts of the forest have been captured and most of 
the district is in our hands he said 
he indicated the government is willing to hold another round of 
peace talks with the guerrilla coalition it is battling 
in bangkok on saturday thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
announced his mediation had won agreement from cambodian prime 
minister hun sen and leaders of the three guerrilla factions to 
resume peace talks some time in the future 
we would like to continue with our national reconciliation 
tea banh said it is very important for us to get peace peace 
that is for the sake of the people of our country if this peace 
comes along with the return of the genocidal regime of the khmer 
rouge it cannot be accepted 
the government refuses to allow the khmer rouge to take part in a 
transitional government noncommunist guerrilla leaders say they 
prefer to share power with the hardline communist khmer rouge than 
fight it 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people in 
attempts at an agrarian revolution in 19751978 
also saturday deputy defense minister gen nhim vanda told 
vietnamese troops celebrating their withdrawal that cambodian troops 
will be able to defend the country 
during the 10 years our vietnamese comrades have been in 
cambodia the cambodian military has improved stepbystep he 
told a phnom penh gathering of vietnamese forces from three 
cambodian provinces 
the guerrillas have their bases near the thai border both in 
thailand and cambodia and receive the bulk of their arms via 
thailand from china they hope in the pailin battle to secure a base 
deeper inside the country as well as revenue from the ruby mines 
vietnam says the last of 26000 troops in cambodia will depart 
tuesday ending involvement in a war that took lives of 25000 
vietnamese troops guerrilla leaders say the pullout is a ploy and 
that hanoi is hiding troops in cambodia 
tea banh said about 10000 cambodian soldiers have been killed or 
wounded in combat and another 10000 died or were hurt by sickness 
or landmines

west germanys foreign minister on 
saturday denounced east germanys ban on a dissident group and east 
germanys former intelligence chief reportedly said he favors change 
in his communist homeland 
the east german interior ministry on thursday outlawed the 
fledgling neues forum prodemocracy group saying it harbored 
antistate policies activists say the group has grown from 30 
to more than 3000 members in two weeks 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher denounced the 
east german governments action 
can it be antistate when people want to make contributions 
toward reforms of state and society why are they being shoved into 
illegality instead of being listened to and taken seriously 
genscher said in a speech in the west germany city of kaiserslautern 
his speech was made available to reporters in bonn in advance 
neues forum is among a host of prodemocracy groups that has 
sprung up across the country as east germanys aging leaders 
continue to reject kremlinstyle reforms despite the emigration of 
thousands of east germans to the west in recent weeks 
neues forum leaders have vowed to challenge the governments 
action in court 
there have been signs of disunity over the question of reforms 
within east germanys ruling communist party with some east german 
officials conceding in recent days that changes are necessary 
a west german newspaper on saturday quoted east germanys former 
head of intellingence marcus wolf as saying changes are 
important and belong to the huge theme of socialist renewal 
the sueddeutsche zeiting also quoted the former spymaster who 
retired in 1987 and still lives in east germany as saying it is 
important to think over the causes of the exodus of thousands of 
east germans to the west and also speak about it 
wolf also said communist east germany stands on solid 
foundations and that we can look into the future with 
optimism the newspaper reported 
the hamburgbased newspaper bild am sonntag quoted east berlin 
pastor rainer eppelmann who is also a leading prodemocracy 
activist as saying many people within the east german communist 
party favor reforms 
eppelman said the banning of neues forum is the futile attempt 
of a small leadership group within the party to head off 
historic developments that are to come the newspaper said 
the communist party is no longer a monolithic block the desire 
for openness and change is now even driving communist party 
members eppelmann was quoted as saying 
eppelmann also said the current reform movement in east germany 
is only the tip of the iceberg and will grow dramatically the 
newspaper reported 
there will be more voices and they will become more urgent 
the lutheran church pastor was quoted as saying 
bild am sonntag is a sunday newspaper it telexed copies of its 
interview with eppelmann to other news agencies in advance 
thousands of east germans have been fleeing to the west in recent 
years hungary acclerated that flood on sept 10 when it began 
allowing thousands of vacationing east germans unrestricted access 
into austria where they traveled to get to west germany 
since then nearly 20000 refugees have reached west germany 
hundreds of other east germans in czechoslovakia and poland have 
converged on west german embassies in recent weeks seeking asylum 
on saturday bild am sonntag quoted unidentified diplomats as 
saying that east germany tentatively has agreed to allow its 
citizens holed up inside the west german embassy in warsaw leave for 
the west 
in prague more than 100 east germans climbed a fence to the west 
germany embassy compound there friday night and saturday bringing 
to 720 the number of people in the tent encampments at the embassy

flashing the thumbsup sign secretary 
of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze today moved through the final rounds of talks to put 
the finishing touches on a series of arms control agreements 
the most significant step was the soviets dropping their 
insistence that curbs on the us star wars missile defense be 
completed before a strategic arms reduction treaty 
that appeared to break an impasse over talks to slash longrange 
nuclear weapons arsenals said a senior us official 
a senior official traveling with president bush in boston said 
baker and shevardnadze are expected to announce that a summit will 
be held within the first six months of 1990 mostly likely in the 
spring 
the two both flashed the thumbsup sign as they strolled briefly 
through the woods before resuming their discussions 
we are working very hard baker said 
the announcement that the soviets had dropped a major demand came 
friday night as baker and shevardnadze also neared agreement on an 
accord to open each others underground nuclear tests to onsite 
inspection 
the foreign ministers began their final talks at a rocky mountain 
lodge today with expectations high that they would set a target 
date for a summit between bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
the foreign secretaries also made progress toward several other 
arms control agreements they were expected to sign before heading to 
new york on sunday for a united nations meeting 
a senior us official speaking on condition that he not be 
further identified said the soviet agreement to separate 
negotiations on the star wars missile defense system and start talks 
breaks a fouryear deadlock on the issue 
minister shevardnadze said they had dropped their linkage 
between completing and implementing in start and achieving a defense 
in space accord said the official 
the us official stressed the need to clarify the soviet 
position but said this looks like a positive development 
many lesser points of disagreement remain in the proposed 
450page start agreement but resolution of the space defense issue 
could accelerate the start pact the official said 
until now said the official the soviets have said they would 
not want to enter into a start agreement until there was an 
understanding on defense in space 
a soviet spokesman boris malakhov said there would be no 
immediate soviet response to the american comments 
the agreement on onsite inspections would clear the way for 
senate ratification of two ussoviet treaties that were signed in 
1974 and 1976 the pacts have been observed by both sides but they 
have never agreed on how to monitor them 
details on the agreements were left to be resolved after fridays 
session said a second senior us official 
the other issues that were ready or near completion were 
a protocol on determining the size of superpower chemical 
weapons stockpiles to assist completion of a multilateral 
convention to stop production of such substances 
an umbrella agreement covering verification of means of counting 
weapons to be eliminated under start 
a pact under which the two sides would give each other prior 
notification of strategic exercises involving weapons which in 
wartime would threaten the other 
a statement to expand the superpower human rights dialogue from 
emigration issues to cover revisions in the soviet criminal code 
occupational health and the environment 
a pact to lift the socalled ice curtain that since 1948 has 
prevented alaskan eskimos from visiting their distant relations in 
soviet siberia 
despite the friendly atmosphere the two sides remained divided 
over the major negotiation before them start 
shevardnadze presented the americans with what one soviet 
official called exhilarating proposals to clear a main obstacle 
to start an agreement on adherence to the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty that pact curbs development of spacebased defenses 
such as the strategic defense initiative as the star wars plan is 
formally known 
the proposals dealt with space tests of potential weapons but 
american negotiators said they did not mark a sharp departure from 
previous soviet ideas 
a senior state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said most of the bakershevardnadze session was devoted 
to us complaints that the soviets were boosting military shipments 
to allies involved in wars in central america asia and africa 
asked whether shevardnadze promised to curtail the arms flow the 
official said each side has a more complete understanding of some 
of the others concerns 
disagreement over regional conflicts however likely would be 
overshadowed by the five agreements 
under the protocol on testingsite inspections soviet inspectors 
would monitor the nevada test site and us inspectors would observe 
tests in soviet kazakhstan 
us inspectors using a system known as corrtex would be notified 
in advance of a test explosion at the soviets semipalatinsk site 
they would drop a cable into a nearby fourfootwide hole the 
force of the explosion would be measured by the speed at which the 
cable was smashed 
under the 1974 and 1976 treaties us and soviet underground 
nuclear blasts the only kind not outlawed are limited to 150 
kilotons

syrian and christian forces clashed with 
mortars and machine guns in the hills overlooking beirut saturday 
shattering a truce that had brought thousands of hopeful refugees 
flooding back to their ravaged city 
police reported three people were wounded in the christian 
enclave north of beirut when mortar rounds exploded in residential 
neighborhoods 
officials said the clashes appeared to be limited but residents 
who have seen several ceasefires collapse were anxious 
a newly formed committee made up of officials from the various 
factions met at a horse track on beiruts dividing green line and 
announced that shipping blockades imposed by both sides would be 
lifted immediately 
the arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi told reporters that the 
group agreed to work immediately on consolidating a ceasefire 
and to reopen beirut airport the countrys only public airport 
which has been closed since march 12 
but three hours later the fighting flared ibrahimi told the 
christian voice of lebanon radio these are unnecessary setbacks 
im getting in touch with the members of the committee to curb this 
deterioration 
the committees next meeting was scheduled for sunday 
the clashes were the first reported since 10 pm friday 
sporadic bursts of automatic weapons fire and occasional 
rocketpropelled grenade explosions had been heard throughout the 
day along the green line 
after rejecting numerous other truce attempts by the arab league 
both christians and moslems agreed last week to adhere to the latest 
peace proposal 
the committee comprises representatives from christian leader 
gen michel aouns command the rival moslem army command of maj 
gen sami khatib and syrias two militia allies the shiite moslem 
amal and the druse moslem progressive socialist party 
but the syrians were not represented although their army has 
been the main force fighting aouns troops they claim they were not 
involved and that the committee is a matter for the lebanese only 
all but 150000 of beiruts 15 million population had fled the 
shelling for safer areas 
buoyed by the glimmer of hope that peace may be at hand tens of 
thousands of people jammed the highways saturday leading into the 
city from south lebanon where many moslems stayed 
khalil hatab said that he his wife and six children had lived in 
one room they rented in the south lebanonese village of barja for 
the last six months 
can you imagine the eight of us living in one room for half a 
year he said as he was caught in a traffic jam at ouzai on 
beiruts southern outskirts 
some of the time we even had relatives neighbors and friends 
who escaped with nowhere to go 
at the christian port of jounieh cars were bumpertobumper on 
highways leading into the christian heartland from the north 
by police count 929 people have been killed and 2738 wounded 
nearly all of them civilians since the bombardments began march 8 
two days after aoun imposed a blockade on ports south of beirut 
operated by druse and shiite militias 
the syrians and their allies retaliated by shelling the 
christians 310squaremile homeland enclave north of beirut and 
blockading it 
aoun initially rejected the arab league plan because the security 
committee would not include the syrians but he changed his mind 
friday after pressure from christian leaders and arab governments 
the arab league plan seeks a political settlement of the civil 
war in which more than 150000 have been killed 
it calls for the 73 surviving members of lebanons 99seat 
parliament to meet outside lebanon to formulate political reforms 
that would distribute power equally between christians and moslems 
the predominantly maronite catholic christians have dominated the 
government parliament the judiciary and army since lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 
at that time they were considered the majority although there 
has been no census since 1932 moslems now form an estimated 55 
percent of the 4 million population 
hardline maronites who are mostly proeuropean have resisted 
surrendering their traditional privileges which include the 
presidency for fear of being swamped by the moslems 
aoun had gambled that western powers including france and the 
united states would come to his rescue when he launched his war 
of liberation to drive out the syrians 
but that did not happen and it was a major blow when washington 
closed the us embassy in christian east beirut sept 6 after he 
accused washington of supporting the syrians

after years in the thick of the communist partys 
struggle to build soviet socialism boris n yeltsin says he knows a 
place where the average working man is happy and secure 
that place he is telling his soviet supporters is the united 
states 
the silverhaired populist who has spent the last two years 
irritating president mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet 
establishment returned from a ninecity tour of the united states 
on monday to face two pressing controversies 
one was resolved within days when the powerful communist party 
daily pravda publicly apologized for reprinting an article alleging 
yeltsin boozed and spent his way across the united states 
the other surrounds his comments about life in america 
reminiscent of tales that have drawn immigrants to the new world for 
generations 
the comments were rosier than many americans would venture they 
are bound to be noticed by party officials who question yeltsins 
loyalty to communist ideals whether he has any firm program to cure 
the soviet unions economic ills and wonder whether his longterm 
plan is to elbow out gorbachev 
their supermarkets have 30000 food items yeltsin told 
20000 supporters friday in his first public appearance since 
returning you cant imagine it it makes the people feel secure 
in order to understand what theyre missing and therefore change 
their own society yeltsin said at least 100 million soviets must 
pass through the american school of supermarkets the leaders must 
be first 
the 58yearold siberian who came to moscow in 1985 and was named 
by gorbachev to run the capitals party organization also cited 
us bounty in the popular weekly arguments and facts 
the point is obvious for soviets struggling through shortages of 
items such as cigarettes meat matches and soap in the fifth year 
of gorbachevs reforms americans yeltsin told his supporters 
know how to work they enjoy life and they are humane they live 
very well 
he pointed a finger at the soviet approach to building a 
socialist society 
our decadesold slogan to catch up with america and leave it 
behind was of great damage to us because it exists for itself for 
the sake of prestige not for the people 
we will never catch up with them and never leave them behind 
and we do not need to strive for this we must strive for a better 
life for our people in both his address to the crowd in 
zelenograd outside moscow and his newspaper interview yeltsin 
noted america too has its problems primarily unemployment but he 
glanced over them 
yeltsin says he supports gorbachevs restructuring program but 
differs on tactics he says conservatives are keeping gorbachev from 
moving faster and warns gorbachevs program is losing steam 
he told the crowd the soviet union should work for more favorable 
trade agreements with the united states invite american farmers to 
till soviet land on longterm leases and allow americans to build 1 
million apartments and sell them to whoever can afford them 
yeltsins barbed criticisms have not been lost on gorbachev who 
fired him as moscow party chief in november 1987 after he questioned 
the partys policies and pace of reform 
yeltsin subsequently was stripped of his candidate membership of 
the ruling party politburo but has become something of a folk hero 
for his attacks on privileges for party and government officials 
in march muscovites gave him 89 percent of the vote for the 
capitals seat in the new congress of peoples deputies 
yeltsin told the zelenograd crowd he thought pravdas publication 
of the article alleging misconduct was an effort to help force him 
off the central committee at an upcoming meeting 
but pravda itself acknowledged doubts about the accuracy of the 
story it reprinted from the italian newspaper la repubblica and no 
such move emerged 
however according to yeltsin his criticisms did come up 
at the end of the plenum gorbachev says yeltsin returned 
from america he talks about how good it is in america and we all 
were criticized by him including we central committee members and 
the presidium which i head yeltsin told the crowd 
i told him right thats the way it was he added 
the crowd applauded

j william fulbright former senator 
and university president said warfare is a disastrous utterly 
irrational activity 
the 84yearold fulbright spoke to about 50 students at the 
university of arkansas which he headed between 1939 and 1941 
it is absurd for us to contemplate a war he said friday i 
suppose you could call me in a sense a pacifist but i dont think a

arkansas law requiring notification of 
parents 48 hours before a minor undergoes an abortion interferes 
with a doctors right to practice medicine and a womans right to 
the operation a lawsuit contends 
among the plaintiffs is a 16yearold girl in her 11th week of 
pregnancy 
the 1989 law also assigns jurisdiction for granting exceptions to 
the law to arkansas probate courts which under state law have no 
jurisdiction over minors the american civil liberties union alleged 
in the suit filed friday in federal court 
the lawsuit seeks to declare the law unconstitutional and asks 
for an immediate injunction against enforcing the law however no 
hearing date has been scheduled 
the law was passed last spring before the us supreme court 
ruling on july 3 that gave states more leeway on restricting 
abortions through such things as banning them at public hospitals 
the high court is due to consider the constitutionality other types 
of abortion restrictions in the coming term which begins next month 
attorney stephen engstrom of little rock who filed the suit 
along with attorney nm mac norton of little rock said he 
asked attorney general steve clark on friday to allow an abortion 
for the 16yearold identified only as sally x 
he refused he told us to take our best shot i think that was 
insensitive engstrom said 
the suit filed later friday names clark and the state as 
defendants 
im ready to defend this law i believe its constitutional 
clark said adding that he did not believe the plaintiffs had tried 
to use all legal procedures outlined in the law 
cooperating in the lawsuit is planned parenthood of greater 
arkansas which offers abortion counseling another plaintiff is dr 
curtis stover of little rock who performs abortions 
parental notice is unjustified because it increases the medical 
risk to the teenager said nancy libbe a planned parenthood 
spokeswoman 
the lawsuit contends that the law places an undue burden on the 
teenagers right to an abortion and an excessive burden on either 
the teenager or the doctor in locating both parents there is an 
exception if the whereabouts of one of the parents is unknown 
in addition the law is so vague that a physician could be 
subject to criminal penalties yet cannot understand what the law 
requires of him the lawsuit said

iran and two proiranian terrorist groups 
threatened saturday to punish saudi arabias pagan regime for 
beheading 16 shiite moslems accused of bombing mecca during a 
pilgrimage to islams holiest shrine 
iran rejected saudi allegations that the iranian embassy in 
kuwait trained and equipped the 16 kuwaitis to carry out the 
bombings in mecca saudi arabia 
tehran radio quoted ayatollah ali khamanei irans spiritual 
leader as saying the consequences of the executions thursday will 
plague the saudis 
he branded the beheadings another crime at the hands of the 
rulers of saudi arabia these dear martyrs were killed for the 
crime of supporting the islamic republic and their love for irans 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 
the radio quoted iranian president hashemi rafsanjani as saying 
the saudi government with baseless allegations is striving to 
create divisions within the kuwaiti nation this is against the 
interests of saudi arabia 
the executions of the shiite moslems members of irans dominant 
religion appeared to scuttle recent moves aimed at restoring 
relations between iran and saudi arabia where sunni moslems 
predominate 
the two branches of islam have feuded for centuries 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god also vowed in a 
statement published in beirut to avenge the execution of the 
kuwaitis 
hezollah the umbrella group thought to hold 16 western hostages 
in lebanon said the executions were a terrorist act and an 
organized crime 
the deep grudge that rules the actions of the pagan regime 
will be a motive for avenging the blood of the oppressed 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
nicosia said a similar threat was made by a group calling itself 
the organization of the islamic revolution in the arab peninsula 
in june the group claimed responsibility for the slaying of an 
egyptian driver working for the saudi embassy in brussels belgium 
several saudi diplomats have also been killed in recent months 
around the world 
irna quoted a statement by the group saying the executions will 
further speed up retaliatory moves by moslems and strengthen their 
determination to eradicate this unholy root from the most sacred 
land on earth 
irna also quoted an unidentified iranian foreign ministry 
spokesman as saying that recorded confessions of the convicted 
kuwaitis broadcast by saudi television were false allegations 
disseminated by the saudi government 
in their confessions the kuwaitis said they had received 
sabotage training from iranians in a remote area of kuwait they 
also said two iranians at the embassy in kuwait provided them with 
explosives and timing devices 
the spokesman blamed the attacks on mercenaries working for 
saudi arabia to suppress moslems who reject saudi control of the 
holy shrines 
with the execution of a number of oppressed kuwaiti moslems the 
saudi regime has further exposed its antiislamic nature the 
spokesman said he urged the worlds moslems to break their 
silence over these atrocities 
otherwise he said the islamic world will continue to witness 
torture and bloodshed at the hands of the saudi rulers during the 
hajj the annual moslem pilgrimage to mecca 
on july 10 two bombs exploded in mecca birthplace of mohammed 
islams founder killing a pakistani man and wounding 16 other 
pilgrims 
relations between iran and saudi arabia were severly strained in 
july 1987 when more than 400 people most of them iranian pilgrims 
were killed in clashes with saudi security forces in mecca during 
the pilgrimage saudi arabia severed relations with tehran in april 
1988 citing subversion and terrorism 
the saudis imposed a limit on the number of pilgrims in 1988 in 
an effort to improve security iran boycotted the pilgrimage because 
its quota was cut from the usual 150000 to less than 50000

on folly beach a house sat in the road 
in some places houses had disappeared and on sullivans island and 
the isle of palms hurricane hugo had damaged virtually every 
building an aerial tour showed saturday 
hugo tore a wide path along the south carolina coast but areas 
less than 20 miles from some of the worsthit areas appeared 
unscathed about 680000 people live along south carolinas 220 
miles of coast 
over hilton head island and about 150 miles to the south over 
the islands of st helena fripp and paris there were few telltale 
signs of fridays storm aside from boardedup houses and trees on 
the ground 
edisto island just south of charleston suffered serious erosion 
when water rushed over the road and under most seaward houses many 
of which rest on supports no homes were leveled however 
but heading north a band of devastation stretched for 90 miles 
from folly beach five miles southeast of charleston to garden city 
as many as 30 percent of the homes on folly beach had either 
disappeared or were uninhabitable and it appeared that all the 
others had suffered some damage from the rains and wind above 100 
mph one house had been tossed onto a road 
from the air above james island a charleston suburb that lies on 
the inland side of folly beach most of the roads and homes could be 
seen in areas that once were hidden by thick woods but the damage 
to buildings was less than on folly beach 
sullivans island and the isle of palms bore the brunt of hugos 
fury and every structure on both islands appeared damaged 
many houses were buckled and had their supports ripped away and 
sometimes nothing was left but a roof or pilings in the sand 
several houses were in roads roofs were peeled off and trees were 
uprooted 
the ben sawyer bridge the swing bridge that links the two 
islands to the mainland was twisted and tilted so that one end 
dipped 35 feet down to the intracoastal waterway 
at the wild dunes marina on the isle of palms about 40 boats 
were blown across the shore and heaped into a pile at folly beach 
other boats were stacked up between a bridge and condominium project 
just to the north homes in the bulls island area also were 
heavily damaged and a marina in winyah bay near georgetown had 
disappeared 
massive oceanfront homes in the wealthy residential community of 
debidue beach fell from their pilings to the surf and wind had 
ripped off the fronts of houses exposing rooms more than 
threequarters of the homes were damaged 
on pawleys island south of myrtle beach at least three homes 
were across or in the creek that separates the island from the 
mainland some had been moved more than 100 yards a channel of 
water approximately 20 feet wide had sliced the island in two 
roads in pawleys island and garden city were covered with sand 
as far as three blocks from the beach 
myrtle beach and north myrtle beach suffered severe erosion that 
exposed brown soil beneath the beach sand but wind damage was 
minor and an amusement park roller coaster appeared intact

a solidarity journalist was named saturday 
to run polands stateowned television and radio removing communist 
party control of the powerful broadcast media for the first time 
since world war ii 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki chose andrzej drawicz 57 a 
specialist in soviet affairs and a former political prsoner 
the choice to head radio and television was the major remaining 
question mark in mazowieckis government the post will not retain 
its cabinet rank reflecting the new governments view that there 
should be nothing like an information minister trying to shape 
public opinion 
tv is the mass medium that lied the most said krzysztof 
kozlowski a solidarity senator who negotiated media reform with the 
communists during their historic negotiations earlier this year 
gaining control of the electronic media was a nonnegotiable 
point for solidarity during talks to form the east blocs first 
government not led by communists 
the government wants to tell the truth and enable freedom of 
speech for all sections of public opinion mazowiecki told 
parliament sept 12 
the right of access to radio and televison must be equal to 
all he said gone are the times of limiting the freedom of 
polish journalists 
the post was held since april 17 the same day legal status was 
restored to solidarity after a sevenyear ban by jerzy urban who 
as government spokesman aggressively dueled with solidarity when it 
was in opposition 
drawicz will meet with urban on sunday and begin his new duties 
monday his wife vera said in a telephone interview she said 
drawicz was outside the city and could not be reached for comment 
the power of the mass media has been carefully guarded by the 
communists since they came to power in the late 1940s 
poles eager for even a glimpse of the outside world are hooked on 
television nonetheless they have railed against what was shown 
riots and mayhem in the united states for example and what 
wasnt solidarity leader lech walesa for seven years after the 
1981 martiallaw crackdown 
after martial law was imposed journalists were required to go 
through a verification of their loyalty to communist 
authorities many were forced out 
at the talks that led to restoration of solidaritys legal 
status kozlowski said union negotiators concluded that for 
communists the world created by television the artificial world is 
more important than the real world 
drawicz who was jailed along with thousands of others after 
martial law has no significant experience in television but he is 
a respected journalist known for his admiration of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform policies 
there has been considerable debate over the new structure of 
state television the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza has 
been running a backpage forum under the headline what kind of 
television 
some have suggested that the communist party be given 45 minutes 
a week on tv just what solidarty got when it won limited access to 
the airwaves in april 
control of broadcasting likely will be transferred from the 
cabinet to parliament under the committee headed by drawicz and 
including deputy chairmen from its allied parties and the communists 
the committee will be run publicly kozlowski said unlike the 
past when the names of all members but the chairman were kept secret 
viewers say news reports have become more evenhanded in recent 
months and one satirical program even poked fun at communsit 
president wojciech jaruzelski something that would have been 
unthinkable a year ago

a federal judge has struck down a portion of 
federal sentencing law as unconstitutional saying congress gave 
prosecutors too much and judges too little authority to decide 
prison sentences 
us district judge michael m mihm acted in a case involving a 
woman who cooperated with the government and gave key testimony in a 
drug case the prosecution did not recommend a reduced sentence for 
this cooperation and the 1987 law gave the judge no option but to 
impose the full sentence 
since congress granted only federal prosecutors the power to 
request a sentence reduction mihm said thursday the executive 
branch of government has more authority in sentencing than the 
judiciary and that imbalance must be corrected 
the sentencing guidelines were enacted to ensure uniform 
sentencing among judges nationwide so that all criminals are treated 
fairly no matter what part of the country they are in 
us attorney william roberts said the decision is still being 
reviewed and no decision has been made on an appeal to the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals in chicago 
its been a very strong tool for effecting cooperation 
roberts said its certainly my sense that thats exactly the way 
congress intended it to be used 
mihm said congress violated the separation of power doctrine 
if the government lets the decision stand it will apply only in 
mihms courtroom unless other judges around the country follow his 
lead if the government appeals and loses again mihms ruling would 
be the law in the entire 7th circuit which includes all of 
illinois indiana and wisconsin 
mihm acted at the request of attorney richard parsons who was 
representing a woman sentenced to four years in prison after being 
convicted of cocaine conspiracy charges 
parsons argued his client kim curran 26 should get a reduced 
sentence based on her cooperation in convicting two other drug 
dealers 
this girl helped the government a great deal at a great 
personal risk and her cooperation resulted in the conviction of a 
drug kingpin in central illinois parsons said but congress 
said the judge cant consider that in sentencing unless the 
prosecution agrees that power should be equally shared by the 
prosecution and the judiciary 
assistant us attorney tate chambers said he was unable to 
recommend a reduced sentence because ms curran had not gone under 
cover to help convict charles blackie spears or donald meeks on 
drug dealing charges as required by regional policy 
fbi agent robert norton told the court ms curran probably placed 
herself and her family in jeopardy by cooperating completely with 
the prosecution 
theres no question that currans testimony was a significant 
factor in the donald meeks trial mihm said adding that the 
17year prison term given to spears would have been considerably 
less without her cooperation 
he said those facts should have been considered by the 
prosecutors and warranted a reduced sentence

and he sometimes felt worthless 
wesbecker told psychiatrists he had thoughts of taking his own 
life and had acted on those thoughts 12 to 15 times he took pills 
clogged his cars exhaust pipe and tried to hang himself 
wesbecker who was placed on longterm mental disability in 
february also had occasional thoughts of hurting other people the 
records indicate he had mentioned his wifes exhusband and his 
foreman at standard gravure as possible targets

life and illness under court order our lady of peace hospital 
turned over the records friday to greathouse who released a summary 
of the material 
greathouse said that 
wesbecker was voluntarily admitted to hospitals at least three 
times for psychiatric treatment between 1978 and 1987 
the hospital records reflect a man who withdrew from other 
people and had difficulty with onthejob stress once declining a 
promotion and a 4anhour raise because he found the job too 
stressful and demanding

azerbaijan on saturday became the latest soviet 
republic to declare itself sovereign meaning decrees from 
moscow dont have to be obeyed if they conflict with local law 
local journalists reported 
the vote by the supreme soviet parliament in the mostly moslem 
republic in the caucasus also indirectly reasserts azerbaijans 
right to rule nagornokarabakh a predominantly christian and 
armenian enclave that has belonged to azerbaijan since the 1920s 
moscow put nagornokarabakh under its direct administration in 
february because of ethnic violence that has now lasted for 19 
months but the azerbaijan parliament earlier this month rejected 
that step as an infringement on its right to govern territory 
granted it by the soviet constitution 
the law on sovereignty approved saturday by the republics 
supreme soviet establishes the integrity indivisibility and 
inviolability of azerbaijans territory said arif aliev an 
independent journalist he spoke by telephone from baku the 
republics capital 
azerbaijan also was declared independent in all matters 
except those it delegates voluntarily to national authorities in 
moscow aliev said 
the parliament reportedly rejected as illegal an assembly of 
ethnic armenians from nagornokarabakh who in august again voted to 
secede from azerbaijan and join armenia 
estonia on the baltic sea was the first of the 15 soviet 
republics to challenge moscows rule by declaring the republic 
sovereign last november the kremlin leadership immediately 
rejected the move as unconstitutional but government and communist 
party policy have since been altered to give more powers to the 
republics 
since president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
ethnic regions throughout their nation have increasingly asserted 
their independence and embraced their nationalist heritage 
outgrowths of gorbachevs more open society

opec ministers met saturday to try to close ranks 
and agree on whether they can boost their crude production without 
upsetting the oil market 
the officials of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries held their first round of talks in a luxury 
hotel in this picturesque swiss city 
they met for nearly three hours behind closed doors to thrash out 
a range of issues including a longterm strategy and plans for 
marking their 30th anniversary in 1990 
but they decided to huddle privately before returning late sunday 
afternoon to take a look at the world oil market and decide a course 
of action for the last three months of the year 
the ministers are divided over whether the cartel should raise 
its output by 500000 barrels a day or so in the octoberdecember 
period 
some worried a pickup in output would hurt oil prices and their 
countries needed revenues from crude sales 
the cartels secretarygeneral subroto said the ministers had 
eight items on their agenda ranging from plotting a longterm 
strategy to marking the organizations 30th anniversary in 1990 
but the most heated discussions will no doubt center on the 
question of whether the cartel should raise its output by 500000 
barrels a day or so in the last three months of the year 
led by kuwait and the united arab emirates the cartel already is 
producing well over its production ceiling of 195 million barrels a 
day for the last half of the year 
without reining in the overproducers analysts say prices could 
slip a bit with increased supply gasoline prices at the pump would 
likely be little affected though 
even before the talks began the ministers were divided over 
their next step 
one side appeared to feel the market was steady enough and 
consumer demand strong enough to absorb an increase 
mana saeed otaiba petroleum minister for the united arab 
emirates said that there are some indications the market could 
absorb an increase 
a final decision he said depends on the market 
if the market is allowing that we will do it if not we 
will not increase the ceiling he told reporters before the start 
of the evening meeting 
the other set of ministers clearly wanted the cartel to 
concentrate on getting prices up to the its target of 18 a barrel 
they feared higher production would weaken prices 
we hope that everybody will come down with what he is 
producing so we can get to 18 said libyan oil minister fawzi 
shakshuki 
nigerias oil chief rilwanu lukman who is also president of the 
cartel said the price of oil could do a little bit more 
we would like it to be 18 he told reporters after his 
midday arrival in geneva 
in june the cartel set its target price at 18 a 42gallon 
barrel for the junedecember period 
a benchmark of seven crudes monitored by opec recently averaged 
1704 a barrel it was more than 18 last spring 
west texas intermediate the key american brand has been trading 
in the range of 1950 to 20 a barrel

vice president dan quayle on saturday called for 
moscow to return several islands claimed by japan but occupied by 
the soviets since the end of world war ii 
he also warned japans leading opposition party the socialists 
that their desire to modify a mutual security treaty with the united 
states is wrong 
the socialists helped by scandals and a controversial tax reform 
that have eroded support for the longgoverning conservatives 
currently are riding a wave of popularity in japan 
anybody that thinks you ought to tamper or rewrite or modify 
the security treaty is wrong quayle told reporters traveling with 
him on air force ii it is not just a mere piece of paper it is 
an alliance security deterrence 
more than 50000 us troopers are stationed throughout japan 
under the treaty the socialists want modified 
the socialists also have urged strict checks to ensure us navy 
vessels calling on japanese ports do not have nuclear weapons on 
board a call in conflict with washingtons policy of refusing to 
say whether or not its ships carry nuclear arms 
during a visit to japans northernmost main island of hokkaido 
quayle said america shares japans heartfelt desire for a return 
of several small islands off hokkaidos northern shores which japan 
calls its northern territories 
we hope the idea of glasnost and perestroika will someday come 
to the northern territories and that they will be rightfully 
returned to japan quayle said in a speech at the official 
residence of hokkaidos gov takahiro yokomichi 
soviet troops occupied the islands in the closing days of world 
war ii in 1945 and japanese civilians were evacuated 
the territorial dispute has stalled completion of a treaty 
formally ending the war and a visit to japan by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachevs reforms are based on his policies of glasnost or 
openness and perestroika the restructing of the government and 
economy 
quayle traveled to the japanese air self defense force base at 
chitose where he was briefed on soviet military strength in the 
area 
col minoru hoso flight group commander of the second air wing 
told quayle the soviets have stationed one army division or about 
10000 troops in the disputed islands he said they also have 
400000 troops in the region along with 800 ships and 2400 
aircraft 
quayle later visited the american misawa air base on the 
northern tip of honshu japans main island where he spoke to about 
1000 military personnel and their families before returning to 
tokyo in the evening 
he was accompanied by his wife marilyn and the us ambassador 
to japan michael armacost and his wife 
quayle arrived in tokyo on thursday from south korea on the 
second leg of an asia tour that will take him to the philippines and 
malaysia

a judge barred the city from enforcing its strict 
regulations of pit bull dogs including a ban on all new pit bulls 
after oct 1 
in a ruling released friday state supreme court justice leland 
degrasse called the board of health regulations irrational and 
vague saying the agency had not shown pit bull terriers were more 
dangerous than other breeds 
vicious dog laws are already in place and can be enforced he 
said 
city council member carolyn maloney called degrasses ruling a 
resounding victory for dog owners and citizens concerned with sane 
dog safety laws she had opposed the regulations and submitted her 
own legislation 
the board which enacted rules at mayor edward i kochs request 
called the pit bull a unique public health problem and cited the 
dogs unusual savagery 
the american kennel club sued to challenge the rules which 
required the dogs to be neutered tatooed with a registration number 
and leashed and muzzled or confined at all times 
the city argued that while pit bulls were 2 percent of the citys 
dog population they inflicted 14 percent of the bites over a 
10month period beginning november 1987 
the name pit bull is used for several breeds including the 
staffordshire bull terrier the american staffordshire terrier the 
american pit bull terrier and sometimes the bull terrier bred over 
the centuries for dog fighting they have powerful chest neck and 
jaw muscles

parents are outraged after learning 
that the owner of their childrens private school arrested for 
possessing child pornography was once convicted of child molesting 
it just sickens you to think that your child is in that type of 
environment added the mother of a 5yearold girl who attended 
the fast track fo learning school in daytona beach 
parents were surprised the state does so little to monitor 
private schools 
if all this has happened before why is that school there 
asked a woman whose 6yearold has attended bowens school for the 
past two years why should we have to check this out why was it 
allowed to open 
parents speaking on condition of anonymity talked about the 
school and its ownerteacher in stories published saturday by the 
daytona beach newsjournal and the orlando sentinel 
the schools 18 students ranged from kindergarten to the fifth 
grade 
james n and lulu t bowen were arrested thursday after 
authorities searched their south daytona home and found numerous 
photographic items of child pornography according to court 
documents bowen 51 and his 56yearold wife were each charged 
with 84 counts of possessing child pornography 
bowen was being held in lieu of 420000 bail mrs bowens bail 
was set at 252000 
state attorney john tanner is asking parents of fast track 
students to contact his office to determine if any of their children 
are pictured in the approximately 100 photographs 
the bowens previously operated a daycare center in south 
daytona but in 1984 the department of health and rehabilitative 
services refused to renew the centers license because bowen worked 
there the state claimed the couple lied on the license application 
by not including his conviction anyone convicted of a felony cannot 
work in a daycare center according to a 1984 florida law 
they opened the fast track school in 1986 
in 1966 bowen had pleaded guilty to fondling a minor at a public 
school in grosse pointe woods mich he paid a 250 fine and served 
five years of probation 
police obtained a search warrant for the bowens home after a 
woman reported seeing child pornography there when she went to pick 
up her 7yearold son after class 
because fast track was a private school and not a public 
daycare center it was basically exempt from strenuous state 
supervision said frederick j simpson district counsel for the 
state department of health and rehabilitative services 
the problem with schools is just that they have to register 
with the department of education which does no investigation he 
said theres just no regulation of private schools at all 
the only requirement of nonpublic schools in florida is that 
they comply with compulsoryattendance laws retain student records 
and meet building codes officials said 
in court documents prosecutors say they are investigating the 
possibility of assaults upon children by bowen but they 
declined to elaborate on the evidence including whether current 
students have been identified in the photos or if any molestation 
has been alleged 
parents said bowen was the schools primary teacher although 
mrs bowen occasionally helped out mrs bowen also has been working 
at the city island library in daytona beach planning exhibits and 
running puppet shows for children

charleston gingerly moved to recover from 
the fury of hurricane hugo on saturday with residents taking stock 
of destroyed homes boats and businesses and damage estimates 
topping 3 billion 
the storm wore itself out over canadas st lawrence valley after 
progressively weakening through virginia west virginia western 
pennsylvania and western new york state 
hugo which left at least 27 people dead in the caribbean was 
blamed for an additional 21 deaths in the carolinas virginia and 
new york 
in charleston the hardesthit city on the mainland many 
residents remained without electricity or telephone service 
saturday long lines formed at the few service stations that had 
generators to pump gas 
national guard troops remained on the streets to protect homes 
and businesses from looting they will remain gov carroll campbell 
said just as long as we need to to maintain the safety for 
people 
running water was restored to most places although residents 
were warned to boil it before drinking it and mail service could 
resume monday mayor joseph p riley jr said at a news conference 
banks of pay telephones were to be set up in city parks 
south carolina electric amp gas hoped to have power restored to 
hospitals which had been operating on generators by late saturday 
riley said but utility officials had no idea when residential power 
would be restored 
as many as a halfmillion people were without power statewide 
and ice for coolers was scarce to nonexistent in the state capital 
of columbia 
if youre a camper youre going to be in good shape said 
john e bourne jr mayor of north charleston in a wry observation 
about the primitive conditions 
riley said damage in charleston alone might reach 1 billion but 
accurate assessments of the damage from the regions most 
devastating storm in 30 years would take days at the least 
two billion dollars is a conservative estimate of damage to 
buildings and other structures associated with the tourism industry 
said robert g liming state tourism director 
our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a little 
rugged for a while he said 
i have never in my life seen anything like it campbell said 
after flying over the state for a second day saturday its beyond 
your worst nightmare its devastating 
he estimated that 65 percent of the buildings were destroyed 
along the coastline from folly beach just south of charleston to 
the north carolina border 
sheila and robert pringle returned to their home in mount 
pleasant across the cooper river from charleston to find half of 
it gone a neighbor had a swimming pool filled with mud mrs 
pringle said 
theres no water theres no fences left and theres marsh 
grass everywhere theres nothing called landscaping anymore and 
theres six feet of water in our basement she said 
the marsh animals are dead everywhere she added in fact 
robert says ones hanging up on our garage door opener 
at least 14 people died in south carolina authorities said four 
more died in north carolina two in virginia and one in new york 
state when the storm churned north 
in the storms aftermath three waterspouts tornadoes spawned 
over water moved ashore along the outer banks of north carolina on 
saturday damaging several homes and cars no one was injured 
hugo which first struck land at the caribbean island of 
guadaloupe on monday traveled 2500 miles before slamming into 
charleston late thursday with winds of 135 mph as it made its way 
inland it was downgraded to a tropical storm and lost that 
designation when its winds dropped below 40 mph around pittsburgh 
late friday 
by saturday morning the remnants of hugo had been absorbed by a 
stronger weather front in eastern canada national weather service 
meteorologist joe harrison said in new york 
we really cant find it anymore he said 
dave langston assistant director of eastern relief operations 
for the american red cross said the hugo relief effort in the 
caribbean and on the mainland will cost the red cross 38 million 
the largest stormrelief operation ever mounted by the agency 
we estimate that more than 73000 people have received 
assistance to date and this is just the beginning langston said

flight data recovered from the wreckage of a french 
airliner confirmed saturday that explosives caused the crash that 
killed 171 people over an african desert the government said 
information obtained from the planes black boxes showed that 
the flight proceded in a normal manner until a total interruption 
which translates as an explosion in flight at an altitude of about 
30000 feet said a statement issued by the transport ministry 
the work of the crew was proceeding normally when the recording 
of words and electronic data abruptly stopped the statement said 
it said data from the black boxes backed up the preliminary 
findings of an investigative commission at the site that leads us 
to accept the hypothesis of the presence of explosives on board 
workers searching wreckage in the northern african nation of 
niger recovered both the cockpit recorder which records inflight 
conversations by the crew and the flight data recorder which 
records information such as altitude and speed both devices arrived 
in france late friday night 
the conclusion drawn from the data signals the start of an 
intensive search for the individual or group responsible for the 
bombing of uta flight 772 which was flying to paris from 
brazzaville congo when it crashed tuesday 
the victims included seven americans among them bonnie pugh 
wife of the us ambassador to chad robert l pugh 
in beirut a previously unknown group calling itself the secret 
chadian resistance claimed responsibility on saturday for the 
bombing 
in a typed a statement sent to western news agencies the group 
said the struggle will continue until the complete withdrawal of 
all military colonial forces from africa 
france maintains 1200 soldiers in chad to help the former french 
colony in its 16yearold war with libya but libya and chad signed 
an agreement aug 31 putting an end to the conflict 
responsiblity for the uta bombing earlier had been claimed by the 
iranbacked shiite moslem group islamic jihad 
islamic jihad is among several radcal fundamentalist groups 
believed to be part of hezbollah or party of god the 
iraniansupported umbrella group thought to hold 16 western hostages 
in lebanon 
callers claiming to represent islamic jihad demanded the release 
of shiite moslem religious leader sheik abdulkarim obeid who was 
kidnapped from southern lebanon on july 28 by israeli forces france 
has not been linked to the kidnapping 
however ashshiraa a beirut weekly recently quoted islamic 
militants loyal to iran as charging france with reneging on a 1988 
deal that resulted in the release of three french hostages held in 
lebanon the newspaper said the militants were planning attacks on 
french interests in africa 
france continues to deny making any deal for the hostages beyond 
agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with iran 
nevertheless recurring reports in the french press detail a deal 
in which france secured release of the hostages by agreeing to free 
anis naccache a proiranian lebanese terrorist serving a life 
sentence for attempting to kill former iranian prime minister 
shahpour bakhtiar in france in 1980 
before the latest claim an unidentified source at the 
presidential elysee palace was quoted by the french news agency 
agence francepresse as saying that the manhunt for the plane 
bombers would be focused on the shiite network in africa 
police meanwhile were examining the planes passenger list for 
suspects concentrating on nine people who got off in the chadian 
capital ndjamena the planes last stop before exploding over the 
tenere desert in eastern niger 
investigators also are loking for clues about the precise nature 
of the explosive where it was located on the aircraft and how it 
got on board 
autopies on the bodies of the victims were expected to reveal 
traces of material or toxic substances that would help answer these 
questions 
a brief statement by the transport ministry late friday night 
confirmed that an investigating commission of officials from france 
niger and chad had found indications of explosives aboard the 
flight but it provided no details until the announcement on 
saturday 
the french army in charge of recovering the victims flew 200 
body bags to the site saturday where paratroopers and military 
doctors have been working in 120degree heat the violence of the 
explosion and the rapid decomposition of the bodies are expected to 
make identification of some victims difficult 
about 100 bodies already gathered for transport were to be 
flown saturday by helicopter to agadez a village in central niger 
and then on to niamey the capital said col jean job who is 
supervising the operation the rest of the passengers remain 
scattered across miles of sand 
among the dead retrieved from the wreckage is the pilot georges 
raveneau and four other crew members found in the cockpit of the 
plane and identified by their uniforms job said workers at the 
site said watches on the victims indicate that the explosion 
occurred at 208 pm tuesday

state tourism director robert g liming said saturday 
our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a 
little rugged for a while liming said but we have positive 
attitudes weve been saying when i breathe i hope thats one 
of our state mottoes

business destroyed while the one next door was left intact some 
tourism businesses already have reopened 
in 1988 tourists spent 47 billion in south carolina with the 
impact of that spending estimated to be close to 75 billion he 
said before hugo liming said the state predicted a 6 percent to 
8 percent growth in tourist spending this year now he said that 
should reach only 4 percent 
details about damage were somewhat sketchy since people have not 
yet been allowed to return to much of the coast and electricity and 
telephone lines were down here is a list of how individual areas 
fared along south carolinas 220 miles of coast 
charleston most of the historic buildings downtown suffered 
some wind and water damage but the main structures remained 
intact thats a blessing because thats what makes charleston 
liming said 
north myrtle beach from cherry grove south to windy hill 
beachfront motels were heavily damaged some were destroyed 
several highrise hotels had erosion under their foundations but 
none appeared likely to collapse an 8 pm 7 am curfew was in 
effect to prevent looting

had their supports ripped away several houses were in roads 
the wild dunes resort known for its golf course and tennis 
courts on the north end of isle of palms just north of 
charleston suffered heavy damage 
the larger of the highrise buildings in the resort apparently 
remained intact but liming estimated only 10 percent of the houses 
remained gov carroll campbell said boats at the wild dunes marina 
were stacked atop one another like toys 
folly beach as many as 30 percent of the homes had either 
disappeared or were uninhabitable and it appeared all the others 
suffered some damage 
edisto island suffered serious erosion with water rushing over 
the road along the waterfront and under most oceanfront homes many 
of which were on poles

this 319yearold city suffered some 
damage from hurricane hugo to its wealth of historic buildings and 
sites but history was on its side 
the most famous monument fort sumter in charleston harbor 
where the first shots of the civil war were fired suffered about 
1 million in damage to tourist areas but was mostly intact 
according to the interior department 
the national trust for historic preservation based in 
washington will send representatives to charleston to assess the 
damage to historic buildings mary hoyt an official with the 
group said saturday 
the organization was worried that hugo had dealt a major blow to 
the nations architectural history but early reports indicated a 
remarkable lack of damage she said 
no other city has as many historic landmarks ms hoyt said 
charlestons historic district is home to about 2000 buildings 
including 73 built before the revolutionary war 
among them are the drayton hall plantation set on a bluff over 
the ashley river northwest of charleston which was built in the 
1730s the plantation house a twostory red brick building with 
white columns suffered some water and wind damage but apparently 
is structurally sound ms hoyt said 
the citys elegant battery district an area of palatial 
2centuryold homes that look through massive oaks draped with 
spanish moss to charleston harbor beyond are still occupied by 
families a walking tour saturday found many missing shingles and 
shutters and countless shredded oak trees but the colonial and 
georgian mansions stood unbroken 
broken oak trees damaged some formal gardens and blocked some 
streets 
we have seen lots of roof damage lots of fallen trees and 
lots of garden walls knocked down said kitty robinson of the 
historic charleston foundation there is a great deal of mud and 
water on the first floors of some of the houses on the battery but 
fortunately there appears to be little structural damage 
this house has been here for 269 years said john mccrady 
who along with his neighbors was cleaning up hugos mess saturday 
we just lost a few slates off the roof 
mccradys house was built in 1730 by william bull who later 
became the lieutenant governor of the colony of south carolina for 
the british 
wayne jordan a history professor at charleston college said 
most of the oldest city structures had already withstood a furious 
hurricane in the late 1750s as well as the famous 1886 earthquake 
that destroyed dozens of lesser buildings 
the oldest buildings we have were designed to withstand 
storms and the ones that are left have been through this before 
jordan said but id say there hasnt been a storm of this 
magnitude for 200 years 
twofootthick walls raised foundations and sturdy storm 
shutters all are staples of the old structures jordan said 
safeguards not found in newer buildings that in some cases crumbled 
like matchsticks under hugos force

president bush on saturday signed a bill 
designed to free a washington mother jailed 25 months ago in a 
bitter child custody dispute and attorneys filed an emergency 
motion for herrelease 
yokesman marlin fitzwater said bush signed the 
bill to free dr elizabeth morgan out of compassion for her 
plight 
the bill was approved by congress amid growing national 
attention for the case it applies retroactively to morgan who was 
jailed for failing to produce her 7yearold daughter hilary for 
courtordered visits with the girls father dr eric foretich 
morgan a prominent plastic surgeon hid her daughter and went 
to jail after alleging that foretich had sexually abused the girl 
foretich has repeatedly denied those charges and at one point 
offered a 5000 reward for information that would help find the 
girl 
the childs whereabouts however remain secret 
hours after bush signed the bill morgans attorney adrian roe 
filed the papers with the district of columbia court of appeals 
seeking her release 
court clerk richard hoffman then began telephoning each of the 
nine judges on the panel in hopes that one could come to the 
courthouse and review the request despite the new law morgan 
cannot be freed without a judges order 
im doing my best to transmit it to the judges and thats all 
i can do hoffman said 
roe said he was hopeful the court will act promptly but we 
have no guarantees roe said 
the bill takes advantage of congress authority to review 
district laws and among other things sets a 12month cap for civil 
contempt childcustody jailings it also contains a socalled 
sunset provision that means it automatically goes off the books in 
18 months 
as clamor over the case grew the house and senate accelerated 
action on the bill a lateworking senate approved the measure on 
friday morning shortly after midnight and sent it to the 
presidents desk 
rep frank wolf rva the house sponsor and utah republican 
orrin hatch who pushed the measure in the senate both have said 
they were motivated by concern for morgans dilemma 
foretich and his attorney elaine mittleman have complained 
that the bill does not require morgan to produce hilary 
president bush has been badly served by his advisors 
mittleman said in a telephone interview saturday president bush 
obviously loves children but this bill does nothing to insure that 
hilary will ever see her father again 
as the bill raced through the congress and to the president the 
entire appeals court was reviewing an august decision by a 
threejudge appeals panel that morgan should go free 
in that earlier decision the judges had ruled that morgan 
should be released because the coercive basis for her jailing had 
become unconstitutionally punitive

government efforts to restore peace 
suffered another setback with 14 people killed in ethnic strife 
military officials said saturday 
the officials said the latest victims all sinhalese were 
killed friday they gave no details 
independent sources said at least 35 people were killed in 
ethnic violence in the previous 24 hours 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity as did the 
military officials said 24 people were killed in south and central 
areas of this indian ocean nation and 11 bodies were found in 
kandy 55 miles northeast of colombo most of the recent killings 
have been blamed on sinhalese militants waging a campaign against 
the sinhalesecontrolled government 
justice minister vincent perara told parliament that 865 people 
were killed in ethnic violence between aug 15 to sept 15 
military officials said since sept 15 at least 350 more people 
have been slain raising the known death toll to 1215 since aug 
15 
in its latest peace initiative the government announced 
saturday it will include members of an extremist sinhalese group 
the peoples liberation front in a multiparty committee to monitor 
peace efforts in tamildominated northern and eastern zones of the 
country 
indian peacekeeping forces have been patrolling that region but 
about 600 of insidan soldiers left for home friday 
it was the first indian withdrawal since sri lanka and india 
signed an agreement monday stipulating that india will pull out all 
of its troops by dec 31 
india deployed an estimated 47000 soldiers in july 1987 to 
supervise a sri lankanindian peace accord that offered tamil 
rebels limited autonomy if they laid down their arms 
but the largest tamil group rejected the accord and began 
fighting the indians in a push for an independent tamil homeland 
the presence of indian troops ignited a backlash by the 
sinhalese militants they claimed the government had offered too 
many concessions to the minority tamils and compromised the 
nations sovereignty by accepting indian soldiers to the country 
tamils most of whom are hindus form about 18 percent of sri 
lankas population of 16 million and claim discrimination by the

said he would be talking about achieving further arms reductions 
theres a chance for agreement of that nature

summit in the united states and that he had discussed that with 
shevardnadze when they met in the oval office last week

freedom of the press and religion are on the 
agenda of the soviet legislatures second session starting monday 
and debate is expected to be sharp even though many proposed 
reforms have little chance of approval 
the 4monthold legislative session during the spring and summer 
reacted to kremlin proposals but this time a group of 345 reform 
deputies spent saturday discussing an alternative platform one 
concept they considered was the freedom for anyone to start a 
newspaper 
the interregional group which includes such figures as human 
rights activist andrei d sakharov and maverick communist boris n 
yeltsin also proposes the open sale of paper printing presses and 
copy machines under the continuing system of censorship 
distribution of these items is strictly limited 
gavriil popov an economist said the group plans to vote on its 
platform sunday 
the legislature or supreme soviet has a formidable agenda it 
plans to act on 80 bills in 45 working days items include human 
rights ethnic strife and salvaging the economy 
all are very important deputy sergei s alekseyev told a 
governmentsponsored news conference friday all should be 
adopted 
but the supreme soviet once a rubberstamp body that met a few 
days a year to approve the kremlins actions has changed under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of restructuring and 
glasnost or openess 
alekseyev said there are no fewer than four versions of a new 
law on the press and glasnost one calls for a complete ban on 
censorship staterun radio moscow reported friday 
the draft platform of the interregional group calls for the 
elimination of internal passports freedom to move in and out of 
the country access for defense lawyers to investigative reports 
public financing of parliamentary factions the creation of 
nongovernment television and unemployment insurance 
but even the interregional group does not suggest ending the 
ban on private ownership of land a vital concept of soviet 
communism 
legislators also will consider bills on the right to strike on 
raising pensions private cooperatives and taxation said rafik n 
nishanov a legislative leader and onetime communist party leader

san juan residents on saturday 
hauled water from swimming pools rivers and parts of the island 
unaffected by hurricane hugo as crews worked around the clock to 
restore water and electricity 
interior secretary manuel lujan and a group of us congressmen 
arrived in puerto rico for a twoday factfinding trip to puerto 
rico and the us virgin islands 
officials say hugo caused at least 27 deaths and billions of 
dollars in damage in puerto rico the virgin islands and other 
islands of the eastern caribbean before hitting the us coast on 
thursday 
president bush has declared both puerto rico and the us virgin 
islands disaster areas in addition 1200 military police and 
other troops were dispatched to st croix in the virgin islands to 
halt widespread looting 
officials in the virgin islands complained that the bush 
administration was more interested in deploying troops than 
airlifting relief supplies to the stricken us territory 
at a news conference here saturday rep george miller 
dcalif who headed the congressional factfinding team was asked 
why federal assistance did not start arriving in the virgin islands 
and puerto rico until four or five days after the storm 
that is one of the reasons we are here miller said 
in washington the defense department said the islands had 
already received relief aid including 100000 army field rations 
15000 cots four electrical generators with operating crews and 
medical personnel from the 109th evacuation hospital of the alabama 
army national guard 
it said more nonperishable food and plastic sheeting for home 
repairs would also be sent 
the defense department reported the navy ship pensacola had 
arrived at st croix and was producing 58600 gallons of water per 
day it said truckmounted water purification units were being set 
up in puerto rico to provide about 270000 gallons of fresh water 
daily 
virgin islands lt gov derek hodge said the territory was 
receiving large amounts of aid but distribution of the supplies 
was disorganized 
he said he expected the mainland military troops to remain 
another week or so 
puerto rico was returning to normal despite millions of dollars 
in damage particularly in the eastern part of the island 
in the capital of san juan roads were cleared and supermarkets 
and some restaurants were open but twothirds of the city of 11 
million people still had no running water saturday and onequarter 
had no electricity utility officials said 
they said 70 percent of the island was without running water and 
up to 35 percent without electricity 
utility officials said water service could be restored to san 
juan by saturday night if work was completed as planned on 
installing four electric motors to run pumps at a dam servicing the 
metropolitan area a us army c130 flew into the capital saturday 
night with 20000 gallons of water for distribution 
with a steady downpour saturday radio station woso suggested 
that listeners catch rainwater 
the government was distributing water in national guard tanker 
trucks the department of health advised residents to boil any 
drinking water collected from other sources 
hodge said friday that hugo left homeless more than 45000 
people about 90 percent of st croixs population st croix 70 
miles east of puerto rico is one of the three main islands of the 
group which also includes st thomas and st john 
he said damage was tentatively estimated at 4 billion 
however gerald connolly a federal emergency management 
administration coordinator in the virgin islands said saturday his 
office had made a preliminary estimate of 400 million 
the justice department obtained authority friday from virgin 
islands gov alexander farrelly to order fbi agents and deputy us 
marshals to enforce all laws on the islands and to prosecute any 
looters officials said 
there were no reports of looting friday but virtually every 
store in christiansted the capital of st croix appeared to have 
been cleaned out in earlier looting 
the national guard has acknowledged that some of its members 
took part in the looting and several witnesses said some police 
also were involved

terrified by a new wave of political 
violence the family of an abducted human rights activist fled this 
country saturday after spending nearly six weeks holed up in a room 
at the red cross 
maria rumalda cameys husband her two babies her brother and 
his family left for madrid under spanish diplomatic protection 
they were following six other relatives who were granted 
political asylum by spain last week 
it is incredible how this family has been persecuted angel 
alfredo figueroa the deputy federal attorney general for human 
rights told the associated press 
their flight began aug 15 when armed men burst into the 
activists modest home in esquintla province at 5 am and dragged 
her off 
i heard the shots and the screams it was her kidnapped 
said her husband jose gonzalo camey who was interviewed last week 
in the crowded room where he and his family had taken refuge 
his 23yearold wife was the fourth person in her family to 
disappear in 10 months the others eventually turned up all shot 
dead and dumped on roadsides camey a 23yearold farmer doesnt 
believe his wife survived either 
under the rightist generals who ruled in the early 1980s tens 
of thousands of guatemalans died or disappeared including cameys 
father his wife has been a member of the mutual support group an 
organization made up of relatives of the missing 
human rights groups put the toll of dead and disappeared as a 
result of activities of rightwing death squads at 40000 they say 
many of the squads were linked to the army or other security forces 
tens of thousands of others have been displaced fleeing the 
militarys scorched earth campaign against leftist guerrillas in 
the countryside 
after his wife was abducted cameys family and his 
brotherinlaws family fearing for their own safety sought 
refuge at mutual supports office in the capital of guatemala city 
30 miles away 
about thirty minutes after they arrived a grenade was lobbed 
through the window they were evacuated to the red cross where 
they remained for nearly six weeks 
with the advent of civilian rule three years ago human rights 
abuses began to abate 
but in the last two months there has been a surge of killings 
and bombings bodies have been found along the roads their hands 
cut off fear has returned 
guatemala is returning to the bloody times camey said 
cradling his children there is terrible violence not just in my 
home but in many homes 
human rights workers blame the latest violence on rightwing 
extremists who believe that president vinicio cerezos rule is too 
liberal cerezo who has survived two coup attempts has denied any 
security forces are involved in the current violence

officials declared a forest disaster in 
south carolina on saturday after hurricane hugo left half the 
states 43 counties with extensive or moderate timber damage 
it certainly is one of the worst forest disasters that south 
carolina has seen in many many years said steve scott a 
forester with the state forestry commission 
the storm which came ashore near charleston packing sustained 
winds of 135 mph tore a path across south carolinas coast early 
friday although its strength was dissipated once it hit land hugo 
uprooted trees and broke limbs as it quickly moved north into north 
carolina 
extensive timber damage defined as an area that will require a 
great deal of salvage occurred in nine counties on or near the 
coast moderate timber damage requiring some salvage occurred 
in 12 counties and all the rest of the states counties suffered 
light timber damage scott said 
forestry is the thirdlargest manufacturing industry in south 
carolina generating 43 billion annually and employing more than 
30000 
seventyfive state personnel were surveying damage in the 
hardesthit areas saturday and 35 tractors were brought in to help 
salvage efforts he said 
scott said he could not yet estimate the cost of the damage and 
it was still too early to develop a replanting plan or ask for 
relief aid he said 
we will be working with all the private landowners in trying 
to salvage the material he added its going to be a big job

finance officials of the worlds seven largest 
economic powers saturday expressed dismay at the persistent 
increase in the value of the dollar this year and pledged to take 
coordinated action if necessary to drive the us currency lower 
in their first meeting since april the finance ministers and 
central bank governors of the socalled group of seven the united 
states japan west germany great britain france canada and 
italy stepped up their rhetoric aimed at curbing the buoyant 
dollar a development threatening to derail improvement in the us 
trade deficit 
the group had expressed a similar concern last spring but the 
tone of the statement released saturday was considerably stronger 
holding out the threat that if the dollar rises any further the 
economic powers would intervene together in world currency markets 
the ministers and governors considered the rise in recent 
months of the dollar inconsistent with longer run economic 
fundamentals the group said in a twopage communique released 
after the eighthour meeting 
they agreed that a rise of the dollar above current levels 
could adversely affect prospects for the world economy and 
agreed to cooperate closely in exchange markets the statement 
said 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady emphasized this part of the 
communique in a briefing for reporters but he refused to say what 
specific actions the countries would be willing to take if the 
dollar goes higher 
in april the officials used milder language and simply said 
they agreed that a rise of the dollar which undermined adjustment 
efforts would be counterproductive not any rise 
the group meeting two hours longer than expected at blair 
house across the street from the white house also addressed 
topics ranging from the third worlds crushing 13 trillion debt 
to western efforts to aid economic reforms in eastern europe 
officials told reporters the extra time was devoted to 
discussing events in poland and hungary which the communique 
termed historic 
the whole meeting of the g7 became electric when we started 
talking about the events going on in the soviet union and poland 
brady said adding that the finance ministers hoped the 152nation 
international monetary fund would be able to reach quick agreement 
on a loan package for poland 
on third world debt the communique praised bradys latest 
initiative for achieving substantial progress 
since the brady plan was announced in march commercial banks 
have struck tentative agreements granting relief to mexico and the 
philippines 
last week however three major us banks added more than 4 
billion to their loss reserves for developing country loans 
analysts are expressing concern that this could signal 
unwillingness to make enough new money available to sustain growth 
in the developing nations most of them in latin america 
the communique noted the development saying diversified 
financial support from the banks is needed to support sound 
economic reform programs through a broad array of new lending and 
debtdebt service reduction mechanisms 
but it was the groups remarks on the dollar that were most 
eagerly awaited by financial markets 
thats a much stronger statement against any rise in the 
dollar said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer i would expect on the heels of that 
statement more aggressive dollar selling from central banks 
he said the g7 countries likely now will be willing to 
accelerate the decline of the dollar when it is falling on its own 
not just counter any rise and he speculated that japan and 
germany would show more willingness in the months ahead to raise 
their interest rates as a means of influencing exchange markets 
possibly he said the federal reserve may nudge us rates lower 
an increase in japanese and west german interest rates would 
make investing in those countries more attractive and would thus 
raise the value of their currencies a cut in interest rates in the 
united states would push the dollar lower 
the g7 has issued statements in the past pledging to hold the 
dollar down but despite heavy intervention in currency markets 
efforts have been largely unsuccessful the volume of private 
currency trading has grown so huge that it dwarfs any buying or 
selling that central banks can do 
since the last g7 meeting the dollar has appreciated by about 
10 percent against the japanese yen and 3 percent against the west 
german mark the dollar on friday bought 146 yen and 195 marks 
well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of the trading 
range sought by the group of seven 140 yen and 190 marks 
a strong dollar hurts the trade deficit by raising the price of 
us goods on overseas markets while making foreign goods cheaper 
for american consumers the trade gap shrank by 22 percent last 
year but progress has slowed in 1989 with the deficit shrinking 
at only about half of last years rate 
in addition to the narrow question of exchange rates finance 
officials discussed the broader issue of economic coordination the 
united states has been pressing west germany and japan to stimulate 
consumer demand in their countries as a means of cutting their 
trade surpluses and reducing the us deficit the united states 
in turn is being urged to reignite efforts to curb its budget 
deficit which is believed to contribute to the trade deficit 
the group of seven talks were being held before the start of the 
annual meetings this week of the imf and its sister lending 
organization the world bank 
the g7 session was preceded by a group of five meeting the 
g7 excluding canada and italy at the treasury 
brady met oneonone with ryutaro hashimoto the new japanese 
minister of finance and pierre beregovoy the french finance 
minister it was bradys first meeting with hashimoto

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev will hold their first summit meeting next 
year officials announced saturday as the two superpowers completed 
a halfdozen accords and cleared a major roadblock to a treaty on 
slashing longrange nuclear weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who spent the 
weekend in talks with secretary of state james a baker iii said 
the summit would be held in spring or early summer he 
announced a key concession from moscow to move ahead toward a 
longrange weapons agreement despite its objections to the us 
star wars program 
first official word of the summit plans came from bush who 
informed reporters on a golf course near his vacation home in maine 
after taking a telephone call from baker i think around the 
world people will be pleased he said bush expressed pleasure 
with the outcome of the weekend talks and said he would meet 
gorbachev in the united states possibly in washington 
later in a written statement bush said i envision a broad 
discussion of the full agenda that the two sides have established 
human rights bilateral relations arms control regional issues 
and transnational issues 
bush spoke more than a thousand miles from the snowcapped rocky 
mountain resort where shevardnadze and baker obviously pleased 
with their diplomacy reached agreement on a chemical weapons 
accord and several other points 
the agreements include 
exchange of data on chemical weapons by the end of the year 
and visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plants 
by june 30 in a second phase there would be more intensive 
onsite inspections of the submitted data 
an umbrella agreement in principle that there should be 
verification of missile plants and information exchanged even 
before a treaty to slash longrange nuclear weapons is completed 
advance notification to the other side of exercises with 
longrange bombers and other strategic weapons 
a ceiling of 10 on launchers carrying mobile intercontinental 
ballistic missiles at any one base some of the launchers would be 
exposed for monitoring 
cooperating to enhance the power of the international court of 
justice to settle disputes 
two agreements to facilitate movement across the bering 
straits of eskimos in alaska and eskimos in siberia for visits 
agreement on interpreting international rules for ship 
movements 
baker later told reporters that the two sides took a series of 
steps across the full arms control agenda to overcome old 
misconceptions and build trust 
in one of a pair of conciliatory gestures shevardnadze said the 
soviets would dismantle their krasnoyarsk radar facility the 
united states has charged the siberian radar was intended to be 
part of a spacebased defense outlawed in a 1972 treaty 
the soviet foreign minister insisted however the united states 
should remove our concerns about us radar stationed in 
greenland and britain 
baker said later he would be surprised if the soviets were 
demanding that the us facilities be dismantled 
baker said shevardnadze wanted to send soviet inspectors to the 
sites to make sure the radar is legal under the 1972 treaty 
in fact baker said the installations are totally legal and 
any action on them required the approval of denmark and britain 
the soviets also removed another key impediment to a strategic 
arms agreement dropping their demand the pact include limits on 
submarinelaunched cruise missiles shevardnadze and baker said in 
backtoback news conferences 
during the talks the soviets said a deal to limit 
nucleartipped slcms can be reached in a separate simultaneous 
agreement shevardnadze and his aides said 
but the united states remains skeptical that means can be found 
to monitor nuclear slcms said baker and senior us arms control 
aides predicted the soviets might not insist on completing the slcm 
agreement before signing the more sweeping strategic arms accord 
shevardnadze also told reporters that moscow was making a major 
concession in arms control negotiations announcing that his 
government would not let its objections to the us star wars 
program block completion of a treaty to cut long range nuclear 
submarines missiles and bombers by 30 to 50 percent 
the preparation and signing of a treaty now appears to be 
quite in reach he said 
baker hailed the move but stressed there are some difficult 
issues that still remain he cited keeping track of cruise 
missiles aboard airplanes submarines and combat surface ships 
we have moved from confrontation to dialogue and now to 
cooperation he said of the evolving superpower relationship 
the longrange weapons talks in geneva have been deadlocked over 
the soviet demand that the treaty depend on completion of a 
separate agreement on spacebased defense since the united states 
declined to give ground on the search for a star wars defense in 
space against soviet ballistic missiles that made an arms 
reduction accord improbable 
baker acknowledged the soviet concession on star wars stressed 
bushs commitment to proceeding with the us spacebased defense 
program and said he had offered the soviets the opportunity to 
visit research facilities associated with the program 
baker also said the bush administrations willingness to lift a 
ban on mobile icbms made it possible for us to move ahead on 
developing verification measures for mobile missiles 
shevardnadze said this agreement for a summit reflects the 
confidence of both sides that they will be able to reach important 
mutually acceptable agreements and generally to achieve substantial 
progress in relations between our two countries and here i am 
referring above all to the sphere of disarmament and security 
the twostage chemical weapons agreement provides for an 
exchange of data by the end of the year and inspection of us and 
soviet stockpiles and plants beginning next june 30 
more detailed inspections would be held later if the 40 nations 
meeting in geneva are within reach of an international treaty to 
ban the deadly weapons 
additional lastminute work remained to be done on another 
agreement for inspection of us and soviet underground nuclear 
weapons test baker said he hoped it could be completed before the 
windup of his talks with his soviet counterpart 
after a fishing expedition on sunday morning baker and 
shevardnadze head for new york for the opening of the united 
nations general assembly on monday 
their work on the ground was also farreaching the chemical 
weapons accord will open us and soviet arsenals and plants to 
crossinspection and the two sides will exchange data on the deadly 
weapon 
apart from the formal agreements baker invited a group of 
soviet experts to visit los alamos national laboratory and the trw 
corps test facility in san juan capistrano to learn more about 
us research on space defenses 
an announcement said the soviets also would visit a particle 
beam project at los alamos and observe a laser project at the trw 
test plant 
the us believes that such visits would be useful 
confidencebuilding measures and would reduce the risk of 
technological surprise the announcement said 
but it addedour invitation is not preconditioned on a 
reciprocal invitation by the soviets

the united nations has agreed to 
send 700 unarmed observers to patrol the borders of five central 
american nations to deter guerrilla incursions president jose 
azcona hoyo of honduras said saturday

scheduled to arrive in october but azcona said at a press 
conference that a larger force had been agreed upon 
he said members will patrol border areas of el salvador 
honduras nicaragua costa rica and guatemala 
he also said that the demobilization repatriation and 
resettlement of contra guerrillas fighting nicaraguas leftist 
government is progressing 
central america is about to enter into a stage of true 
democracy azcona said he said the contras must accept 
demobilization because they havent got the resources to do 
anything else 
the ussupported contras have been based in the hills of 
eastern honduras near the border with nicaragua since 1981 for 
most of that time they operated with honduran knowledge and 
consent but azcona and president daniel ortega of nicaragua signed 
an agreement aug 7 calling for disbanding the contras by dec 8 
most of the contras retreated to yamales along the border with 
nicaragua in march 1988 when the united states cut off weapons 
aid however us support at the latest count was still feeding 
12000 fighters and 42000 relatives 
while some contras have deserted others have marched back into 
nicaragua with their weapons to await the outcome of nicaraguan 
elections scheduled for february both the sandinista government 
and the contras have said they will refrain from offensive 
operations 
the aug 7 agreement also signed by guatemala el salvador and 
costa rica called for 100 observers from west germany spain and 
canada to monitor the accords 
azcona said the larger un peace force will be made up of 
military personnel and civilians based in all five countries he 
said they will patrol border areas to discourage armed guerrilla 
incursions 
he gave no date for their arrival

contras while el salvador has accused nicaragua of supporting and 
arming salvadoran leftist guerrillas 
teams from the united nations and the organization of american 
states as well as other international observers have been 
visiting central american nations in preparation for disbanding the 
contras and holding the nicaraguan elections

pope john paul ii called saturday for 
increased national and international efforts to fight the drug 
trade but said addicts should be treated with compassion 
the various public institutions on the national and 
international level are called on to put a brake to the expansion 
of the market of narcotics substances the pope said during a 
visit to a drug rehabilitation clinic on his threeday tour of 
tuscany in nordhern irtaly 
the interests that gain financially from such a trade must be 
brought to light john paul said 
then the instruments and mechanisms they use must be 
identified and finally one will proceed to their coordinated and 
efficient dismantling 
the pope without mentioning any countries by name said there 
is a need to promote development in those regions where residents 
depend on production of drugs for their livelihood 
john paul also praised the work of rehabilitation clinics and 
social programs that offer addicts alternative models of life 
to lead them away from drugs and reintegrate them into society 
drugs are fought not only by health and judicial means but 
also and especially by installing new human relationships rich 
in spiritual and tender values he said 
the pope said drug abuse is a clear symptom of a society that 
no longer succeeds in living true values and pushes those who use 
drugs into egoism and solitude 
in this climate the goals to pursue become money power 
career consumer goods one is ready to pay whatever price to 
obtain them he said

the city council on saturday enacted an 
emergency ordinance barring pricegouging in this hurricaneravaged 
city where 5pound bags of ice were being sold for 10 and long 
lines snaked outside stores that opened 
it would be an unfair trade practice to charge something 
higher than prehurricane prices said mayor joseph p riley jr 
who called for the emergency legislation the council passed in a 
vote by telephone 
if i hear of the instance of someone doing that not only will 
they be arrested but i will personally take pleasure in 
participating in the arrest riley said 
violators would be subjected to fines of 200 and jail terms of 
30 days 
the emergency ordinance is in effect until commerce returns to 
normal riley said 
authorities reported that gas at some locations was selling for 
3 to 450 a gallon 
riley cited the instance of ice being sold for 10 the state 
emergency operations center requested that merchants charge no more 
than 2 a bag 
there is a problem with gouging said john lawson a 
spokesman for the state emergency preparedness division 
long lines flowed from stores that managed to open saturday 
partly because police asked that no more than 10 people be allowed 
in stores at any one time robbie roberts manager of a food lion 
grocery store in charleston that suffered only a few damaged 
ceiling tiles said a couple of thousand customers showed up 
saturday before the store was forced to close because it had no 
lights 
lines were going out the parking lot and into the street 
roberts said it takes them about four hours to get into the 
store 
it was hairy at times but it worked out all right roberts 
said it was hot and people were irritated others were cutting 
in line 
cashiers used pocket calculators 
people bought anything they could get their hands on he 
said and trucks outside gave dry ice to people he said 
a crowd hoping to get ice in the parking lot at the citadel mall 
started pushing and shoving and police were called but there were 
no injuries or arrests maj charles wiley said 
frankly some people were panicking over ice wiley said 
noting that food could begin spoiling after two days without 
electricity 
it wasnt a riot but it could have been said police lt 
mike connolly one of the first officers on the scene there was 
some pushing and shoving cursing just some hot tempers 
at another mall motorists turned one lane of a road into a 
parking lot when they jumped out of their cars to get ice that was 
being given out 
the city has been without electricity since thursday when 
hurricane hugo toppled power lines in much of the state leaving 
hundreds of thousands of people without power 
restoring electricity may take a very long time riley said 
theres no electricity coming into the transmission lines and the 
generating capacity down here is gone 
utility crews from georgia alabama and florida have been sent 
to south carolina to help he said 
riley said the city surveyed 2000 buildings onethird the 
total in charleston and found 24 in varying degrees of collapse 
he said there also were a number of collapsed chimneys in danger of 
sliding off sloped roofs and extraordinary tree damage in the 
city 
despite the difficulties the mayor said he was inspired by the 
spirit in which charleston residents endured the hardships 
throughout the city today people are upbeat and they are 
thankful he said theyre thankful theyre alive and that the 
city is essentially intact 
the american red cross expects hurricane hugo relief efforts to 
be the costliest in the organizations history a spokesman said 
saturday 
dave langston assistant director of eastern relief operations 
of the red cross said the storm will cost the agency an estimated 
38 million 
we estimate that more than 73000 people have received 
assistance to date and this is just the beginning langston said 
at a news conference 
more than 150 volunteers and paid disaster specialists will be 
brought into carolinas and other affected areas he said

the states republican committee on 
saturday declined to censure state rep david duke for his past as 
a leader of the ku klux klan 
the committee has no authority to kick duke out of the party 
but two committee members who worked on the censure said they had 
done so because of dukes past of promoting racial violence his 
antisemitism and his neonazi philosophies 
neil curran and elizabeth rickey both of new orleans tried to 
introduce the resolution at the partys quarterly meeting the 
resolution was tabled without debate 
curran an advertising and media consultant and rickey worked 
for dukes opponent john treen during the legislative campaign 
duke said 
basically they cant accuse me of doing anything wrong they 
cant question my stated platforms they have to go back in my 
past duke said 
lee atwater chairman of the republican national committee 
censured duke after he won his legislative seat in february but 
the state republican party has shied away from any move to censure 
duke 
they voted in effect that they dont think its proper to 
deal with it state party chairman william nungesser said after 
saturdays vote

after six years as grand wizard a national post duke later

an investigation into the crash of usair flight 
5050 focused saturday on the possibility of mechanical failure 
although officials said the rookie copilot had punched the wrong 
cockpit button just before the craft plunged into the east river 
investigators continued removing pieces of the planes fuselage 
from the water off a runway at laguardia airport national 
transportation safety board spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said the 
parts will be examined to determine if there were any mechanical 
problems in addition to the pilot error he said 
speaking of the copilots mistake lopatkiewicz said it may 
turn out that was unrelated to what happened 
another factor under investigation was the planes unexplained 
veer to the left acting national transportation safety board 
chairman james kolstad said at a news conference saturday night he 
also said investigators found marks on the runway that showed the 
planes three sets of wheels were skidding down the runway 
the flights pilot and copilot had their flight licenses 
suspended for leaving the accident scene and were strongly 
criticized friday by federal officials for failing to immediately 
submit to drug and alcohol testing 
at a time when drug abuse has become a major national problem 
we believe the american public has a right to know that its 
transportation system is alcohol and drug free kolstad said 
the failure to promptly volunteer for alcohol and drug testing 
following a major accident is inexcusable he said echoing an 
angry statement by federal aviation administration head james b 
busey 
the air line pilots association the union that issued a 
statement defending the pilots friday offered no response saturday 
to the testing comments or the suspensions the pilots are not 
required by law to submit to testing after a crash 
pilot michael martin 36 and copilot constantine kleissas 29 
submitted to urinalysis friday following five hours of questioning 
by federal investigators the results of the tests were not 
available saturday 
flight 5050 crashed into the east river late wednesday when its 
takeoff was aborted two people died and 59 others were rescued 
the flight had been headed to charlotte nc 
at a news conference late friday kolstad revealed that kleissas 
attempting his first operational takeoff of a boeing 737400 
inadvertently pressed a button that caused the plane to decelerate 
martin then accelerated the plane but decided to abort the 
takeoff because the craft began drifting to the left and the 
pilot felt and heard a vibration which concerned him kolstad 
said 
he said saturday that two passengers one of them a frequent 
flier told investigators they also felt the vibrations 
martin believed he had enough room on the runway to stop the 
plane but it instead skidded off the runway and into the water 
cracking the fuselage into three sections 
kolstad also said that as the plane accelerated down the 
runway the captain acting as copilot did not call out the jets 
speed as required 
it was clearly a lack of proper procedure being followed in 
the cockpit kolstad said lopatkiewicz said investigators were 
trying to find out what made the plane drift to the left 
flight data recordings that would indicate the planes actual 
speed when it aborted were still being studied 
kolstad also noted the lack of experience in the cockpit noting 
it was kleissas first actual takeoff on a 737400 following 
completion of flight training 
kleissas 29 received his commercial pilots license in october 
1987 and an instructors license six months later his faa record 
shows no previous problems said faa spokesman bob hoppers in 
oklahoma city okla 
martin 36 became a captain on july 1 and had flown only 138 
hours in that capacity on the 737400 though he had about 4000 
hours on 737s mostly as a copilot 
kolstad also said reports quoting kleissas as saying that martin 
mumbled and appeared incoherent in the cockpit before the crash 
were not true and kleissas apologized for making those remarks 
kolstad saturday said that what kleissas had heard was martin 
reciting to himself a safety checkoff list
