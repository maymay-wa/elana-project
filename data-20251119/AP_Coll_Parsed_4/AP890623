the constitution doesnt require that states 
provide free lawyers for inmates who are sentenced to death if the 
prisoners have already lost a round of appeals a divided supreme 
court said friday 
the court ruled 54 to uphold virginia officials who said forcing 
states to pay for secondround appeals could lead to long delays in 
executing inmates 
when inmates file a first appeal in state courts lawyers are 
provided by the state 
if that fails inmates can pursue a second round of appeals like 
other states virginia provides prison law libraries and assigns 
parttime lawyers to help all inmates prepare their secondround 
or collateral appeals in some cases volunteer lawyers are 
available 
death row inmates who lose a second time may then shift to 
federal courts but legal help in those appeals was not at issue in 
fridays case 
in writing the majority opinion chief justice william h 
rehnquist said convicts constitutional rights are not violated by 
cutting off free access to lawyers 
the additional safeguards imposed by the constitution at the 
trial stage of a capital case are we think sufficient to assure 
the reliability of the process by which the death penality is 
imposed rehnquist said 
rehnquist was joined by justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor and antonin scalia 
justice anthony m kennedy supplied the fifth vote to overturn a 
federal appeals court ruling that said condemned killers in virginia 
who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to greater representation at 
taxpayer expense than the state provides 
in a separate concurring opinion kennedy agreed with the result 
reached by the other four but on narrower grounds 
in a dissenting opinion justice john paul stevens said the 
ruling violates simple fairness for death row inmates he was 
joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry 
a blackmun 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled a year ago the 
constitution requires special legal help for death row appeals 
because of their complexity 
twenty states joined in support of virginia they are florida 
georgia mississippi north carolina missouri south dakota

a routine traffic check turned into a drama on the 
boston waterfront thursday as police officers and fire crews tried 
in vain to rescue a police horse that fell through a hole in a pier 
the horse fortrek died from shock a few minutes after animal 
rescuers pulled it from the water thursday at the ac cruise line 
pier at harbor park 
boston police officer edward cahill left the horse tied to a 
fence along the pier while he checked out a vehicle reported stolen 
across the street the horses hind legs fell when asphalt gave way 
on the pier and despite the efforts of cahill and others dropped 15 
feet into the harbor 
william sweet a bus driver for the warpula bus co said he had 
parked his bus in a nearby parking lot and was walking towards the 
bridge when he heard the horse struggling 
i got the officer and by the time we got to the horse it was in 
to its hips said sweet 
sweet said he and three pedestrians assisted cahill in holding 
the horse by its reins and saddle then the horse started slipping 
through the saddle 
police officers firefighters and rescue workers kept the horses 
head above water with secured ropes through the hole while cahill 
and other officers tried to keep the horse calm below the pier 
eventually two cranes were brought to the scene and the horse 
struggling wildly was hoisted back onto the pier minutes later 
however it died of shock and trauma from the fall 
dr edward leonard of the animal rescue league said fortrek may 
have severely injured his back because the horse could not control 
its legs as it was lowered to the ground 
the brown 18yearold fortrek had been assigned to cahill for 
the last six months

containers of two toxic and potentially 
explosive chemicals overturned while being loaded on trucks 
thursday forcing president bush to change his route out of new york 
city 
six hours later workers in special impervious suits found all 
the drums and boxes in the shipping containers intact and the 
emergency was declared over 
the president was delayed by about half an hour in flying back to 
andrews air force force base near washington because his plane had 
to be flown from newark international airport adjacent to the 
mishap area at port elizabeth to john f kennedy international 
airport in the borough of queens in new york about 25 miles away 
the president delayed the departure of his motorcade from a new 
york banquet to permit secret service officials and police to plot 
the route to kennedy 
bush had spent the day in new york winding up at a republican 
fundraiser 
because of the potential hazards we have been advised to move 
air force one and the press plane to another location white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters in new york 
security was extremely heavy with at least 80 new york city 
police and port authority vehicles converging on the hangar at 
kennedy where air force one was briefly parked

robert hornbeck aimed his truck up the 
winding mountain road and eyed the aged forest looming above 
there is your pristine oldgrowth forest said the logger 
pointing to silver shafts of dead and dying trees within the green 
shag of hemlock fir and lightercolored cedar to me its not 
beauty its a little bit pathetic its a forest thats overripe 
it would have been logged by now but it was pulled from the 
market because of the spotted owl and i dont think it will ever be 
logged now if they take it away its a way of life that is gone 
not just jobs 
whether when and where cutting may resume in many northwestern 
national forests wont be known until us district judge william 
dwyer in seattle decides whether to alter a march injunction 
temporarily halting the sale of 1 billion board feet of timber in 
oregon and washington 
dwyers ruling came in a lawsuit challenging a forest service 
plan to set aside 374000 acres as habitat for the northern spotted 
owl environmentalists charged that the plan fails to set aside 
enough oldgrowth forest to ensure the owls survival dwyers 
injunction expands the affected acreage 
meanwhile the us fish and wildlife which refused in 1987 to 
list the spotted owl as a threatened species reversed itself in 
march and decided the birds dwindling habitat warrants giving it 
that status a yearlong process 
oregon gov neil goldschmidt and state congressional leaders have 
called a summit meeting saturday in salem to try to resolve 
conflicts over the owl the governor the states entire 
congressional delegation and representatives of government agencies 
and timber and environmental groups will attend 
the prospect that the owl will be listed as a threatened species 
has added more doubt to the future of timber supplies 
but there is much more at stake than board feet of lumber and a 
subspecies of spotted owls said forest ecologist peter morrison of 
the wilderness societys seattle office who insists im no tree 
hugger 
we need to consider longterm impacts on biological 
diversity said morrison noting that relatively little is known 
about virgin forests and interactions between plants and animals in 
them 
i can see serious impacts if we give up that biological 
diversity found in an ancient forest and by then it will be too 
late its not going to be just the spotted owl disappearing 
the unique attachment of the owl to old growth is what put the 
bird in the middle of controversy biologists say that while the owl 
can use other forest land it requires a certain amount of old 
growth for nesting and mating if that old growth is too fragmented 
the owl could spend so much time seeking food and shelter that it 
wouldnt have time or energy to mate 
the forest service doesnt know how much old growth is left but 
the wilderness society has estimated that less than 15 percent of 
the original oldgrowth forest remains in the owls range from 
northern california to southern british columbia what is left is so 
badly fragmented that much of it is worthless as habitat for the owl 
and other wildlife 
people want to say lets sit down at a table and reasonably 
talk about this dividing of a loaf when in reality the loaf is all 
gone what we are doing is squabbling over the crumbs said rick 
brown a former mount hood national forest biologist now working for 
the national wildlife federation 
but ted anderson executive director of ffacts a group in 
washingtons skagit valley organized this spring to defend the 
timber industry said its the livelihood of workers and their 
families thats at stake 
national parks wilderness areas wild and scenic rivers and 
other setasides have removed 53 percent of the federal forest lands 
in washington from the timber base he said we simply cant write 
off our industry 
for example six timber sales in the mount baker district 
covering half of the 2200 acres set aside for one pair of spotted 
owls would have produced 47 million board feet of timber to keep 
local mills running for the next year 
to us thats our life said anderson to them its for 
one owl 
andy kerr conservation director of the oregon natural resources 
council said timber jobs are going owl or no owl he cited a study 
by the wilderness society estimating that the 71500 timber jobs in 
washington and oregon in 1985 will shrink to half that by 2030 
mainly because of increased mill productivity stopping the harvest 
of old growth altogether would eliminate only 6 percent of the 
timber and 2300 extra jobs in that period the study said 
chuck sisco of the national audubon society another forest 
service veteran said the agency has bungled the works since 1978 
when it picked the owl as the indicator species for the wellbeing 
of the oldgrowth ecosystem under provisions of the national forest 
management act 
about twothirds of the sites the forest service identified in 
oregon and washington as owl habitats would affect lumbering but 
their own data showed that 65 or 70 percent of the areas they said 
were spotted owl sites in wilderness where logging is prohibited 
didnt have any birds in them sisco said 
on the west side of the olympics larry mason owner of the mason 
lumber mill in beaver reiterated the doubts held by many in the 
timber industry that the spotted owl is threatened even if the 
owls days are numbered he said it is not responsible to shut 
timber supplies down overnight 
mason complained that the fight over the owl vividly illustrates 
the growing urbanrural separation in washington where the 
seattlearea economy has been fueled by a growing aerospace industry 
and computerage businesses while the traditional forest industry 
has been pushed aside 
you know he said there are people who have to get their 
hands dirty every day earning a living and there are city people 
who think the forests should be their private playgrounds

a halfdozen plastic owls are nailed to the crossbeam with a sign 
that says here lie the hopes and dreams of our children 
the residents of this olympic peninsula logging town say they are 
being crucified by environmentalists and the government which have 
closed at least temporarily thousands of acres of timber to 
preserve oldgrowth forest and one of its elusive denizens the 
northern spotted owl 
every way you turn the government the preservationists big 
business they all want your job said garth leavitt a log

modern loggers contemptuously call cutandrun boys who took the 
timber but didnt bother to replant 
logging trucks roar down a main street of gas stations and small 
stores neighborhoods are dotted with swingsets lush gardens and 
yards decorated with rusting saws and other logging tools the air 
carries the peaceful aroma of burning cedar chips from nearby shake

the pain from the shutdown of federal timber sales really 
hasnt hit yet theres still timber in the pipeline from sales 
before this thing got going said mayor warren paul adding that 
it probably will hit just before winter 
but forks merchants say people already are pinching pennies and 
houses are going up for sale as loggers leave for alaskas tongass

suicide rate in the state and an alcoholism rate among the top 10 
percent of us counties the pending economic disaster is going 
to be the thing that is going to turn the community upside down

not far from the site of indiana jones 
final triumph bedouins hawk ancient coins and pottery chips fake 
roman oil lamps and threeminute rides on a grunting camel 
theres nary a sign of the cinematic swashbuckler not even a 
bullwhip or souvenir fedora 
nobody knows nothing about indiana jones says mohammed 
ibraheem alhasanat a guide to the 2000yearold ruins of petra 
where the climax of indiana jones and the last crusade was 
filmed with harrison ford and sean connery 
bedouin boys who guide tourists on horseback to the site shrug 
their shoulders and look puzzled at the mention of the movie 
petra once the heart of a great trading empire is not the sort 
of place where firstrun films play 
tens of thousands of tourists annually visit the remote mountain 
valleys shaped and tinted like melting scoops of multicolored ice 
cream to see petras eerie classical monuments 
the makers of last crusade chose petras most famed edifice 
the 140foottall treasury as the facade for the encounter by the 
fictional archaeologist with the holy grail the cup used by jesus 
christ at the last supper 
local bedouins once sought lesser treasures from the monument 
probably hewn from its reddish rock slab a few years before jesus 
walked the streets of jerusalem 100 miles to the north 
a carved cylinder resembling a chess piece atop the monument is 
scarred by the gunshots of those who tried to break it open 
believing ancient men had left riches inside 
nobody knows if there is any treasure or not another guide 
mohammed alashram said as he pointed to the bullet marks the 
people have heard about this legend for maybe 10 generations 
most of the bedouin seek their gold from the tourists offering 
horseback rides homebrewed tea lukewarm soda pop and minor 
antiquities to the visitors 
almost 1000 yards from the treasury real archaeologists from 
the university of utah are at work on excavations 
digging through a temple dating from the time of christ they 
hope to find more clues to the life of the nabateans the arabian 
people who built petra and ruled a kingdom just beyond romes domain 
the sprawl of their capital is evident from the high place of 
sacrifice an altar to pagan gods complete with a runoff channel for 
blood 
the dizzying rock summit overlooks miles of canyons and hillsides 
carved with the distinctive nabatean monuments and even earlier 
edomite remains 
from a peak at petra the bible says the hebrew chieftain 
amaziah hurled 10000 edomites to their death 
on another summit nearby the biblical prophet aaron died the 
village just outside petra wadi mousa is where locals believe 
moses struck a rock and made water run 
real crusaders in the middle ages left their mark as well in two 
small castles meant to help protect the kingdom of jerusalem 
a few miles north of petra archaeologists have discovered the 
9000yearold village of beidha among the oldest settlements ever 
excavated 
with so much history scattered across the rocks many of the 
workers and residents at petra seemed blase about the arrival and 
departure of a screen star 
at the petra resthouse bar built into a nabatean tomb bartender 
mifleh zoubi waved his hand when asked about the movie 
indiana jones he said joan collins is better

protest and unrest were everywhere 20 years ago 
with civil rights womens rights and antiwar demonstrators 
regularly taking to the streets to cry their causes 
but police arriving at an unlicensed greenwich village bar for a 
routine raid on the muggy friday night of june 27 1969 had no 
reason to expect trouble from homosexual patrons long accustomed to 
sporadic harassment 
certainly no one least of all the participants expected a riot 
that would launch a movement 
for the gay and lesbian movement that was our shot heard 
round the world said craig rodwell whose gay bookstore the 
oscar wilde memorial bookshop has been operating in the village for 
22 years 
there was nothing organized about it at all said edmund v 
white who was at the stonewall inn when the raid began for the 
first time people instead of running away decided to fight back 
the crowd hurled coins bottles and rocks anything at hand they 
set wastebaskets ablaze and threw them into the bars doorway said 
white a novelist 
the next night people gathered again outside the shuttered 
stonewall the police had a riot control unit in the area but white 
said the night had a carnival atmosphere 
we were turning over cars he said we were quite crazy 
for most of those involved it was just a night of great 
excitement that did not necessarily propel them out of the closet 
said michael scherker who is preparing an oral history of the 
stonewall riots 
but many others were propelled into political activity that 
continues today opinion polls generally track a growing rate of 
acceptance of gay men and lesbians among heterosexual americans 
particularly in the cities and laws barring discrimination on the 
basis of sexual preference are on the books in dozens of us 
municipalities 
the sense of rebellion and pride that stonewall inspired is a 
real factor in the number of openly gay people that you see today 
said urvashi vaid executive director of the national gay and 
lesbian task force in washington dc it was not a sentiment 
which existed in the 50s 
in june 1970 one year after stonewall about 3000 people 
marched up manhattans sixth avenue and the idea spread to cities 
across the country 
in new york a month of events ranging from art shows to panel 
discussions culminates this weekend some 30000 people are expected 
at a rally in central park on saturday according to organizers and 
sundays parade down fifth avenue is expected to be the largest 
ever with more than 400000 marching or watching 
march organizers in san francisco which has a sizable gay 
population expect at least a quartermillion participants sunday 
the marches and celebrations this month have special significance 
because of the 20th stonewall anniversary and because of the urgency 
of aids the disease that has claimed thousands of gay lives 
the epidemic has forced homosexuals to put traditional social 
goals on hold in the 1980s as many in the community focused on 
caring for the sick and demanding help from researchers and the 
government 
i think aids has sort of put a human face on gay people said 
neil miller author of in search of gay america i think that 
that has broken down prejudice 
it also has ironically helped to bring a lot of people into 
activism who might not have been so visible or so vocal said 
larry kramer whose acclaimed play the normal heart attacked 
societys slow response to the epidemic 
but vaid said the support gays have won in the aids fight does 
not mean we have greater support for nonaidsrelated issues 
she cited the federal gay rights bill which has been introduced 
in congress every year since 1975 and literally gone nowhere 
the task force has managed to gather only eight senate and 70 
house cosponsors thats an indication of how far we still have 
to go she said 
in the first 10 years we did not have an organized 
opposition vaid said in last 10 years we have had one the 
fundamentalist right that has contributed more than anything to 
negative attitudes toward gay people 
vaid says the work of the future should be directed toward 
getting recognition for our families and our relationships such 
as that provided by san franciscos recently enacted domestic 
partners law 
that will rquire grass roots organizing at the state and local 
level and a willingness by more gay men and lesbians to join the 
effort activists say 
twenty years ago it was such a complete taboo to even talk 
about homosexuality miller said 
in another 20 years rodwell said hopefully whether a person is 
homosexual or heterosexual simply wont matter

in a storefront in arab east jerusalem israeli 
volunteers have set up a hot line to field palestinian complaints of 
misconduct by soldiers settlers and police 
we try to enforce the democratic principle that the authorities 
are accountable to the citizens said tsilli goldenberg a former 
antiques dealer who now works at the hot line for victims of 
violence 
the spare deskandtelephone operation in a former mens clothing 
store is one of more than 40 volunteer organizations created in 
response to the palestinian uprising 
at least 528 arabs and 23 israelis have been killed since the 
revolt against israeli rule of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
began 18 months ago 
in the past year 731 complaints were filed with the hot line 
which can all on 70 volunteers and is financed in part by a grant 
from the usbased new israel fund goldenberg said 
complaints range from a claim that jewish settlers sprayed 
vineyards with toxic chemicals to a report that soldiers contributed 
to the death of a palestinian by delaying an ambulance at a 
roadblock 
aliza herman 28 a chicagoborn civil rights lawyer said some 
palestinians turn to the hot line when they are afraid to file 
complaints with the police or face bureaucratic obstacles 
many times doors are closed to people from the occupied 
territories and they cant get past a guard who tells them to go 
home she said as israelis we know how to get things done 
in one recent case a hot line inquiry resulted in two border 
police officers being disciplined for harassing a palestinian social 
worker he was detained and beaten when he questioned an order to 
clean up the scene of a protest while on his way to work 
getting the army to respond to queries about the location of arab 
detainees or the behavior of soldiers is more difficult 
some of investigators respect us herman said some dont 
speak to us generally we dont get a bad reaction more often we 
are just ignored 
most of the volunteer groups are leftistoriented 
the israel information center for human rights was founded by 
parliament member dedi zucker of the liberal citizens rights 
movement it is partly funded by a us ford foundation grant and 
compiles statistics on human rights violations and social trends in 
the occupied lands 
director zahava galon said three psychologists are studying the 
impact of collective punishment such as house demolitions the 
center estimates that 700 houses have been destroyed since the 
uprising began many as a punishment for the political activities of 
one family member 
they are studying how this affects the dignity and selfrespect 
of the victims and how this will affect their ability to function 
in the future galon said 
she said that despite the volunteer work on behalf of 
palestinians israeli society generally is apathetic about the 
uprising and has not been moved to the kind of protests that helped 
end the threeyear occupation of lebanon in 1985 
this is not a clearcut case like lebanon galon said most 
people dont feel israel is absolutely wrong they feel threatened 
and see the intefadeh uprising as a threat to their existence 
they tend to be more emotional than logical 
other activists noted that israel has not paid the same price as 
in lebanon where more than 700 soldiers were killed and the army 
spent billions of dollars 
the army also has created a volunteer group a team of 20 people 
who have subpoena powers to investigate cases in which army 
discipline appeared to break down most of the volunteers are 
lawyers with combat experience as soldiers 
col haim adini head of the unit and a veteran of three wars 
said he volunteered because he believed the army was at a critical 
juncture and could not afford to duck accusations of misconduct 
you cant sweep these problems under the carpet the 
53yearold adini also a lawyer said in an interview if we lose 
discipline we lose the army 
the volunteers believe they can work more freely than regular 
army investigators because they do not have promotion worries or 
fears about damaging friendships 
so far the unit has started work on 20 cases in which soldiers 
are accused of misconduct adini said that in some cases officers 
tried to cover up for their men either to preserve morale or 
personal ties 
in one case adini said soldiers were not justified in beating 
four arabs in a refugee camp near jericho they overreacted and 
could have handled the situation in a softer way he said he 
declined to say whether he had recommended prosecution 
we are not covering up we are dealing with the cases seriously 
and objectively adinia said in other countries you dont find 
such openness at a time of such pressure on the army

hollywoods new gothic 
actionthriller batman is nothing like the campy television 
series of the 1960s and batmans old tv nemesis found nothing to 
laugh about in the new joker 
this just hit me the wrong way said cesar romero the former 
joker played in the movie by jack nicholson this picture is 
dreary the violence in it good god 
the new batman opens in 2100 north american theaters 
tonight poised like the dark avenger himself to make a killing at 
the box office 
amid a summer slate of movie blockbusters already shining like 
gold for major studios the gotham world of batman glowers in 
its grim portrayal of primeval violence and urban corruption 
this is a very serious heavy crime drama said romero a 
robust 82yearold who just finished filming a cops and robbers 
movie in pittsburgh called simple justice romero attended a 
media screening of batman wednesday night at the invitation of 
the associated press 
its not the batman concept at all romero lamented and 
nicholson who is such a wonderful actor and who has done such good 
work is just so violent 
what we did was fun it wasnt played that way it was a spoof 
it was fun it was a comic strip 
still romero added the picture will probably make a bloody 
fortune 
indeed entertainment industry insiders predict that batman 
may gross more than 30 million in its opening weekend 
the batman romero remembered was as much a reflection of its 
time as pop art and sunflower stickers on volkswagens it was silly 
burlesque with adam wests wooden batman squaring off against a 
new lessthanfiendish villain each week 
and the villains were hardly theatrical slouches there was 
vincent price burgess meredith tallulah bankhead roddy mcdowall 
and frank gorshin 
everybody wanted to be a villain in batman it was sort of 
the thing to do romero recalled 
batmans popularity mushroomed after the series began in 
1966 but the slapstick wore out with all the countless kapows 
and splats by 1968 the show was dead 
i thoroughly enjoyed playing the part playing the joker 
said romero whose film career began in 1934 and who appeared as 
the cisco kid in a series of 20th century fox movies beginning in 
1939 
during the 1940s and 50s romero often appeared as a tall dark 
latin lover and later was cast in roles requiring a suave character 
romero joined the tv show at the invitation of the producer 
william dozier who showed him a proposed script for an episode with 
the joker and a film of the first episode featuring the riddler 
it was great romero said but why he wanted me ill never 
know 
casting against type also is evident in the new film with the 
slight michael keaton playing the hulking 6foot caped menace who 
is more obsessed with avenging his parents death at the hands of 
hoodlums than in truth justice and the american way 
keaton plays a very subdued character romero said the 
joker naturally has to be the flamboyant one 
to say that nicholsons joker is flamboyant is to say that his ax 
murderer in the shining was neighborly or that the actors 
devilish address to a congregation in the the witches of 
eastwick was prim 
but for romero nicholsons joker was too evil too revolting and 
the film was all too dismal and bewildering 
in fact i dont understand what this batmania is all 
about he said

federal marshals roved the southern west 
virginia coal fields thursday to disperse striking miners and end 
wildcat walkouts that have idled nearly 44000 workers in 10 states 
a disabled coal miners 19yearold son was grazed by a bullet at 
a mingo county mine in what state police said was the most serious 
incident since the unauthorized walkouts began in west virginia last 
week the teenager was treated at a local hospital and released 
the target of the sympathy strikes pittston coal group inc 
announced thursday night it was planning to move some salaried 
workers from its operations in west virginia to its holdings in 
virginia where miners have been on strike since april 
pittstons president michael odom refused to elaborate on the 
plan to move workers 
the wildcat strikes in appalachia and the midwest are in support 
of 1900 west virginia virginia and kentucky miners strike against 
pittston 
the sympathy strikes prompted a spate of federal court motions 
obtained by coal companies who want their miners back on the job 
several coal companies in some of the 10 states involved have filed 
complaints with the national labor relations board against the 
united mine workers which in turn has filed unfair labor practice 
charges against companies 
us district judge dennis knapp on wednesday fined six west 
virginia umw locals their officers and members for defying a 
backtowork order issued earlier this week he ordered the us 
marshals office to have deputies serve picketers at any of 12 
island creek coal co mines with copies of his order 
walt biondi us marshal for west virginias southern district 
said deputies were told to order any miners demonstrators or 
picketers to disperse and appear later for a contemptofcourt 
hearing 
biondi said deputy marshals arrived in west virginia on thursday 
from other states to help issue the orders he declined to say how 
many marshals were involved or how long they would be in west 
virginia 
i think its fair to say its going to cost us at a minimum 
several thousand dollars over the next couple of days biondi 
said declining to estimate the total 
the additional manpower also is in anticipation of a federal 
court hearing scheduled friday for at least a dozen coal companies 
seeking backtowork orders for their striking miners 
in us district court in clarksburg judge william kidd on 
thursday said he would rule soon on consolidation coal cos 
petition to force miners from six north central west virginia locals 
to return to work 
backtowork orders also were sought by companies in alabama and 
pennsylvania and consolidation has said it plans to seek similar 
legal action in illinois and ohio 
jamie blankenship 19 was wounded early thursday when a bullet 
grazed his head while he was at hampden coal co a nonunion mine 
shut down by the wildcat strikes state police said union and coal 
company officials blamed each other and police said they were 
investigating 
the wildcat strikes began june 13 
the estimated number of miners involved thursday in unauthorized 
sympathy walkouts according to union and industry officials are 
west virginia 16000 illinois 8000 pennsylvania 6600 alabama 
5000 ohio 2660 indiana 1750 kentucky 2325 virginia 755

casino executives reacted warily 
thursday to a judges ruling that casinos may be held liable for 
money lost by drunk gamblers some worried that it could give losers 
a way to recoup their money 
maybe we have to put breathalyzers at the door said roger 
wagner president of the claridge casino hotel only halfjoking 
us district court judge mitchell cohen ruled wednesday that 
casino operators like tavern owners have a responsibility to their 
customers the judges decision stemmed from a lawsuit between the 
golden nugget hotel and casino and a customer who lost 200000 
shmuel aboud of new york city said casino officials plied him 
with free alcohol and pain killers for his aching back the ruling 
will allow a court case to continue toward a finding of whether the 
casino was responsible for abouds losses 
some observers believe the ruling could mean casinos will stop 
serving free drinks to gamblers and could force the gaming halls to 
forbid drunk patrons from placing bets for fear of liability claims 
some casino executives believe the decision only reinforces what 
the gaming halls already do jim wise a spokesman for tropworld 
casino and entertainment resort said the judge uses such terms 
as obviously and visibly intoxicated we already follow those 
guidelines anyone in that state is neither allowed more alcoholic 
beverages or the opportunity to gamble 
an intoxicated gambler poses problems for a casino wise said 
if someone does not have all his facilities they have viable 
reasons to complain afterward that they were treated unfairly he 
said 
stephen hyde chief executive officer for donald trumps two 
casinos in atlantic city said it is not in our best interests to 
have a drunk sitting at a gaming table making a fool of himself 
trumps casinos will stop serving an intoxicated customer he 
said 
when you stop serving him the patron usually does not go on 
much further hyde said he usually gets a little obnoxious and 
ends up leaving the gambling floor 
but a liberal interpretation of the ruling could give customers 
an easy way to reclaim large losses wagner said 
every idiot in the world will be suing us he said 
likewise casino executives in nevada were worried about the 
judges decision roy galyean president of the union plaza hotel 
and casino in las vegas said are they suggesting that we 
administer a drugalcohol test to a patron before we let him 
gamble 
wagner said cocktail waitresses who stroll casino floors have a 
scripted question would anyone like any complimentary coffee 
juice or soda 
we do not solicit free alcoholic beverages he said but if 
a customer says he wants a beer instead of juice he can have it 
many gamblers will not drink alcoholic beverages because it 
dilutes the decisionmaking process wise said 
lois szabo of new brunswick sipping a pina colada at trump plaza 
hotel and casino on thursday agreed she said most casino customers 
are more interested in gambling than drinking you get so caught 
up in the slots that you actually forget to take a drink 
some customers might take advantage of the decision because 
some people would do anything to sue she said personally 
everybody should be able to control themselves with liquor when 
some people drink excessively they should be responsible for their 
own actions 
judge cohens ruling probably would attract the little guy 
said anna krommer of washington relaxing with a beer at a casino 
bar on thursday 
the casinos are a big attraction for the poorer people who 
imagine they can become richer she said 
gus sunday of philadelphia who visits atlantic citys casinos 
about twice a month said he has never seen a fellow gambler 
intoxicated 
anybody who would get drunk has his own problems its not the 
casinos problem he said people who come to atlantic city are 
not kids they should have enough sense to know when to say no

theres no prize and the winner will have 
to announce her age publicly but that has not discouraged entries 
in the competition to be named illinois oldest active farm woman 
there are so many women active in agriculture today we thought 
it would be fun to see how many keep their hand in the business for 
a long time said karen benning of the illinois department of 
agriculture the agency honored a 97yearold stark county man as 
the states oldest active farmer in 1987 
the oldest farm woman does not have to live on a farm or drive a 
tractor but she must actively manage the farm or be a full partner 
in its operation 
its hard to say whether there are more women or fewer women in 
agriculture than men said mrs benning there are a lot of 
widows who have stayed with the operation and more of that all the 
time 
so far 20 people have requested entry forms and many more are 
expected by the july 21 deadline said mrs benning the oldest 
applicant thus far is 88 years old she said 
the top five candidates will attend the illinois state fair on 
aug 15 when the winner will be announced 
there is no monetary prize but they will be our guests at the 
fair said mrs benning

the soviet union is moving swiftly to repair 
its relations with iran after the death of the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini even as the bush administration takes a long slow look at 
developments in tehran 
both the soviets and the united states were targets of the 
clerics wrath with khomeinis passing soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev is working overtime to reverse a decade of bad feelings 
and make inroads with his successors 
but president bush is standing firm on at least two us 
preconditions for a resumption of the relations severed by the 
united states in 1980 five months after militants took over the 
american embassy in tehran and held the diplomats and marine guards 
hostage 
bush is insisting on renunciation of terrorism and help from iran 
to gain the release of the nine americans held hostage in lebanon by 
proiranian forces 
it is a waiting game with an element of risk an opportunity 
could be lost but secretary of state james a baker iii and 
officials in the state department who keep close tabs on iran 
apparently do not think so 
the postkhomeini situation is still cloudy two viewpoints are 
still vying for control one is the suspicious and fundamentalist 
stance represented by the ayatollah its proponents are as wary as 
khomeini was of the united states and the soviet union the second 
is less uptight but not any less inclined to fall under us or 
soviet influence 
the era of the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi who sought with 
billions of dollars of us weapons to be the kingpin of the persian 
gulf is past it is in irans interest to play the third world 
game of balancing one superpower off against the other a us 
official explained thursday this suggests gorbachevs drive for 
better ties with tehran is unlikely to produce a prosoviet policy 
in iran 
besides said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
where is the urgency where is the fire 
the soviets have been negotiating with iran for three years to 
purchase iranian natural gas the deal isnt struck yet and it 
remains the key to improved economic ties between moscow and tehran 
also gorbachev also could be running a risk the soviets are the 
main weapons supplier to iraq the iranians bitterest enemy if 
gorbachev gets too close to iran he might lose influence in baghdad 
and with a number of other arab countries traditionally hostile to 
the moslem but nonarab iranians 
still gorbachev heartily welcomed the speaker of the iranian 
parliament hashemi rafsanjani to moscow this week on thursday 
the two sides agreed to exchange delegations of moslem religious 
leaders and the soviets hinted in a communique they would send 
weapons to iran 
the key phrase in the communique spoke of strengthening the 
defense capacity of iran that could mean anything from soviet 
spare parts or replacements for armored personnel carriers and 
artillery which the soviets provided iran before the collapse of 
the shahs peacock throne a decade ago to fighter planes 
there was no nuanced phrase when baker replied to congressional 
inquires at a house foreign affairs committee hearing we are 
concerned about the possibility of weapons transfers he said 
referring to his meeting in moscow with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze last month baker told rep william s 
broomfield dmich we indicated our concern across the whole 
spectrum of questions involving proliferation of missiles and 
chemical technology 
asked by rep lee h hamilton dind about the soviet embrace 
baker said us policy toward iran will be guided by developments in 
the country and not by irans relationship with the soviet union 
besides baker said we do not know exactly what course the 
developments in iran will take 
this is the same unhurried approach bush and baker took at the 
outset of the administration when gorbachev was rolling out a series 
of arms reduction initiatives last month the president produced 
his own proposal to reduce soviet and us forces in europe as well 
as nato and warsaw pact weapons arsenals 
bush and baker are taking a similarly measured approach to the 
repression in china of forces seeking a more liberal marxist regime 
defending that policy against congressional calls for stronger 
action baker said the administration was taking carefully 
targeted actions while not being inflammatory in its rhetoric and 
preserving its options for the future 
five months old the bush administrations foreign policy is 
developing several characteristics among them is an unhurried pace 
and a basic idea that us actions abroad will be guided by american 
selfinterest rather than by flashes of intuitive brilliance

the bush administration may halt the 
longstanding policy of loaning third world countries money to buy 
american food says a highranking foreign aid official 
one must wonder why our present food aid structure encourages 
foreign countries to add to their debt burden and whether those 
debts can be serviced in the future said philip l christenson 
assistant administrator of the us agency for international 
development 
christenson did not indicate whether some other way would be 
found to pay for food purchases he did say however that aid has 
decided to make grants rather than loans in the future for longterm 
development projects 
christenson testified thursday before a hearing by the house 
select committee on hunger on whether the distribution of us food 
as aid should be restructured 
grants generally were used rather than loans when the marshall 
plan and other aid programs began under president harry truman more 
than 40 years ago though christenson did not go that far back in 
his account 
he said that 35 years ago loans to third world countries were 
considered highly secure while today many countries have debt 
burdens that are holding down their living standards 
we are asking ourselves whether it makes sense to increase the 
debt burden of these already overextended countries in order to 
finance the importation of a consumable christenson said 
the bush administration also wants to explore whether the loans 
increase the role of government agencies in the borrowing countries 
at a time when us policy is to promote private business he said

members of a housesenate savings and loan 
panel are calling for speedy enactment of president bushs proposed 
bailout but theyre putting off work on it until they get back 
from vacation 
a conference committee appointed to reconcile sampl bills passed 
by the senate on april 19 and the house on june 15 held a brief 
organizational meeting thursday but did not tackle any of the issues 
dividing the two chambers 
senate banking committee chairman donald w riegle jr dmich 
who was named chairman of the conference panel scheduled the next 
session for july 11 
the bush administration noting that the industry is hemorrhaging 
at a rate of 10 million to 12 million a day has been pressing 
congress to move quickly ever since the president proposed his 
bailout plan on feb 6 
however the senate is taking off the last week in june and the 
first in july the house is due to be out of session only during the 
july 4 week 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas who is heading the house 
delegation said he was willing to work through the recess 
the sense of urgency must be sustained gonzalez told 
reporters after the meeting adding that pressure from industry 
lobbyists to weaken the bill never ceases 
i think its important that we do it as soon as possible 
riegle agreed but said it will take aides time to prepare an 
analysis of the lengthy and complex bills 602 pages in the senate 
version and 770 pages in the house 
also two of the five members representing the senate on most 
conference issues sens jake garn rutah and paul sarbanes 
dmd will be in switzerland next week as part of a senate team 
monitoring ussoviet arms talks 
in a related development federal regulators took control of 
three savings and loans in georgia on thursday bringing the total 
under government management to 226 in 32 states 
the three are first federal savings and loan association 
americus habersham federal savings bank atlanta and great 
southern federal savings bank in savannah they have combined assets 
of about 103 billion 
the federal deposit insurance corp has been taking over the most

republicans will represent the house on each issue 
gonzalez called on the conference panel to preserve tough new

the federal budget deficit the house would include it in the 
deficit but exempt it from automatic spending cuts under the

the supreme court struck a blow against 
organized crime and drug dealers by letting the government seize 
assets which defendants wish to use to pay their lawyers the 
nations chief law enforcement officer says 
but attorneys groups said a pair of high court rulings thursday 
undermines the nations system of justice tipping the balance 
unfairly in favor of prosecutors 
the court in two 54 decisions upheld the constitutionality of 
federal laws that permit the confiscation of money and property from 
people accused of crimes even if it means they cannot afford a 
lawyer 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the rulings are a notable 
victory in the governments war on drugs as the court put it 
congress did not write this law to rewrite the old adage that crime 
does not pay to read crime does not pay except for attorneys 
fees 
but scott wallace of the national association of criminal defense 
lawyers said we see these cases as a national tragedy the 
clarence darrows of today and tomorrow are going to go into some 
other area of the law 
american bar association president robert raven head of the 
nations largest lawyers organization said the supreme courts 
decisions today seriously weaken our criminal justice adversarial 
system and impede a persons basic right to retain counsel of his or 
her choice 
he said the aba will ask congress to amend federal law to shield 
legal fees from confiscation 
as it sped toward the expected end of its 198889 term next week 
the court also 
narrowed a centuryold federal law by giving cities important 
new protection against bigmoney damage awards when they are accused 
of violating peoples civil rights 
in the latest in a string of setbacks for civil rights activists 
the court said an 1866 law may be used to sue a city only if it can 
be proved the alleged civil rights violation was part of an official 
municipal policy the court ruled against a former dallas high 
school football coach who said he lost his job because he is white 
ruled 63 in a freespeech case from new york city that 
communities may impose regulations aimed at keeping down the volume 
at rock concerts 
upheld a 200000 libel award against hartehanks 
communications but the decision did not appear to weaken 
significantly the news medias protections against such lawsuits 
in the legal fee cases from virginia and new york the court said 
the rights to due process and a lawyers help are not violated when 
the direct or indirect proceeds of allegedly illicit activities are 
confiscated 
at issue were forfeiture provisions of key federal crimefighting 
laws the continuing criminal enterprise act and the racketeer 
influenced corrupt organizations law 
the rulings also left states free to enact or enforce similar 
laws 
the decisions said a criminal defendants assets may be frozen 
before trial if there is probable cause to believe they were 
obtained illegally defendants who are acquitted may keep or recover 
their assets 
in one case a law firm was denied 170000 in legal fees for 
representing christopher reckmeyer in 1985 he pleaded guilty in 
virginia to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role 
as kingpin of a multimilliondollar drug operation 
reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and ordered to 
forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals that included a parcel of 
land the government sold for 53 million the seizure of his money 
left him without funds to pay the law firm 
in the second case the government appealed a ruling that would 
have allowed peter monsanto access to assets worth 400000 to help 
him pay his lawyers 
monsanto was convicted in new york city of charges he headed a 
heroinselling ring 
the jury had ordered monsanto to forfeit to the government a 
house in mount vernon ny valued at 335000 a 30000 apartment 
in the bronx and 35000 in cash but a federal appeals court said 
monsanto could use the assets to pay his lawyers

airline passengers can still carry laptop 
computers or radio cassette players but the devices are to be 
closely inspected for plastic explosives on us flights originating 
in the middle east and europe 
the federal aviation administration in announcing a new 
inspection order to all arlines thursday said passengers who dont 
need electronic devices on a trip should consider leaving them 
behind 
but the agency and transportation secretary samuel skinner 
rejected proposals to ban the devices on all us flights 
noting the inconvenience a ban of electronic devices might cause 
businessmen and others who use laptop computers or electronic 
equipment skinner announced the new measures in a speech to an air 
freight group 
his office had billed the announcement as a major step in efforts 
to ensure aviation security 
but the action by the faa fell short of calls for at least a 
temporary ban made by relatives of some of the 270 people killed in 
the radio cassette bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland last 
december 
the new screening order is limited to us flights originating in 
europe and the middle east it will not affect foreign airlines 
us domestic flights flights from the united states to europe or 
the middle east or us flights to and from other countries 
the flight 103 victims relatives had called for the government 
to require all airlines to refuse to carry any device that might 
easily conceal plastic explosives pending installation of 
sophisticated detection equipment in airports used by us carriers 
in the united states and abroad 
skinner in april ordered airlines to install equipment that can 
detect plastic explosives with six units scheduled for installation 
before the end of the year 
congress is considering legislation that would have the 
government pay for the explosive screening equipment at about 1 
million per unit out of a 6 billion aviation trust fund the 
administration wants the airlines to pay for more than 100 units it 
wants installed over the next few years 
skinner said the new screening measures take effect immediately 
and will include more than just turning on and off the equipment 
as passengers board a plane he said inspectors will go through a 
series of checks including possibly opening up the devices 
the screening is not likely to put us carriers at a competitive 
disadvantage with foreign airlines he said 
skinner said he expects several other countries to announce 
similar increased screening as the latest reaction to the pan am 
bombing british authorities are continuing their investigation into 
who planted the bomb 
skinner said he consulted with top transportation officials of 
other countries and the officials agree that increased screening is 
the most acceptable and effective method of dealing with the 
danger 
it is my firm belief that the option we have selected provides 
the proper balance between passenger safety and convenience at this 
time skinner said

a leading republican senator is trying to 
persuade robert b fiske jr to withdraw from consideration for the 
justice departments secondranking job to avoid a bitter senate 
confirmation fight 
sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking gop member of the senate 
judiciary committee warned fiske that conservatives could wage a 
filibuster against his senate confirmation if he is nominated to 
become deputy attorney general 
fiske has been the object of conservative criticism for the role 
he played in screening the professional qualifications of judicial 
candidates for the american bar association 
some conservatives argue that when he chaired the abas standing 
committee on federal judiciary fiske improperly applied ideological 
standards to evaluate some of president reagans choices for the 
federal bench 
thurmond one of 14 senate republicans who have urged president 
bush not to nominate fiske made his appeal to the new york lawyer 
at a meeting on capitol hill earlier this week 
sen thurmond is very concerned that a divisive protracted 
debate about this nomination would not be in anybodys best 
interests christopher simpson the senators press secretary 
said thursday 
thurmond did not threaten to wage a filibuster but warned fiske 
that his conservative opponents might do so simpson said 
the meeting on wednesday was convened by minority leader robert 
dole rkansas to give fiske an opportunity to talk with senators 
who had expressed opposition 
fiskes secretary at his new york office said he was traveling 
thursday evening and couldnt be reached 
also present were sens alfonse damato rny and john 
danforth rmo who are among 18 moderate and liberal gop senators 
who signed letters this week urging bush to nominate fiske a 
prominent new york lawyer who once was us attorney there 
sen gordon humphrey rnh who opposes fiske and attended the 
meeting said the issue is causing an increasing polarization 
among senate republicans 
that is something we can ill afford as the minority party in 
the senate humphrey said there is no need for it there are 
lots of wellqualified people why should we have someone against 
whom there is strong opposition 
based on our concerns the white house so far has declined to 
make such a nomination it is the justice department which is 
lobbying for this candidate humphrey said 
i havent heard boo from the white house he added 
the intraparty squabble comes against the backdrop of a dispute 
between the white house and the justice department over remarks 
about fiske that were inserted in a speech bush made to us 
attorneys last week 
a white house source speaking thursday on condition of 
anonymity said presidential aides were flabbergasted when bush 
told the federal prosecutors that he hoped fiske would soon be 
joining his administration 
the washington post in thursday editions quoted unnamed white 
house sources as saying someone from the justice department inserted 
the remark into the speech without the permission of chief of staff 
john h sununu 
david runkel chief justice department spokesman disputed the 
account saying i just dont think it happened the way it was 
described 
the issue of whether to send fiskes name to capitol hill is 
still an open question at the white house the source said 
despite the problems fiske has encountered with conservatives 
runkel said i still believe that he is going to be nominated and 
confirmed

people in the northeast and west are thinner than 
midwesterners and southerners just ask them 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
257 percent of the adults surveyed in indiana and wisconsin 
reported that they were overweight the highest percentage out of 32 
participating states and the district of columbia 
on the other end of the scale was new mexico where only 152 
percent reported being overweight 
among the five heaviest states indiana wisconsin west 
virginia ohio and north dakota four are in the midwest 
meanwhile the slimmest five are in the west new mexico hawaii 
utah montana and arizona 
the prevalence of overweight in this report may be 
underestimated because people may not always tell the truth about 
their weight the cdc cautioned 
the cdc survey conducted in 1987 asked 47975 adults about 
their weight and height and used the information to compile a 
body mass index overweight was defined as a level equal to the 
fattest 15 percent of american adults in their 20s 
by region the west had the lowest overweight percentage at 17 
followed by the northeast at 198 percent the south at 22 
percent and the midwest at 231 percent the atlantabased cdc 
reported 
state and regional variations may result from differences 
in eating habits and exercise practices the agency said 
an estimated 34 million adult americans are overweight putting 
them at increased risk for diabetes high blood pressure and some 
types of cancer the cdc said 
the formula used to compute body mass index is this weight 
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared a figure of 278 
or higher for men or 273 or higher for women indicates overweight 
the cdc said

a new book raises an old cry for abolishing 
government farm programs which the author says have been trampling 
on individual rights sacrificing the poor to the rich and giving 
lawmakers and bureaucrats vast arbitrary power over americans 
the book already has stirred the ire of some farm groups and is 
expected to provide further fuel to new debates in congress on farm 
policy legislation for the 1990s 
james bovard a policy analyst for the cato institute and the 
competitive enterprise institute two washington research firms 
says the government for 60 years has devotedly repeated the same 
agricultural policy mistakes 
at roughly 25 billion a year in federal handouts and 10 
billion more in higher food prices bovard says that would give 
every fulltime subsidized farmer two new mercedes benz automobiles 
each year 
annual subsidies for each dairy cow in the united states exceed 
the per capita income for half the population of the world he 
says with the 260 billion that government and consumers have 
spent on farm subsidies since 1980 uncle sam could have bought 
every farm barn and tractor in 33 states 
bovards book the farm fiasco is being published this month 
by the ics press institute for contemporary studies of san 
francisco 
the book is coming out as congress begins to move toward new 
general farm legislation to replace the food security act of 1985 
which is set to expire next year the 1985 law itself was a step 
toward more marketorientation in farm programs and a modest shaving 
of some features of federal commodity subsidies 
bovard thinks more is needed and quickly president bush he 
said should send a special message to congress immediately calling 
for the abolition of the sugar tobacco peanut honey wool rice 
and cotton programs after those reforms the other commodity 
programs should be ended 
it is vital that president bush set the terms of the farm 
debate that he avoid being boxed in by the farm lobbys usual scare 
tactics and that he avoid at all costs getting locked into a 
reaganstyle ropeadope defense in which he spends all his time 
either denying that a farm crisis exists or asserting that farmers 
are responsible for their own problems he said 
benny bunting president of the national family farm coalition 
said thursday that bovards book is full of outrageous claims that 
do not contribute to the difficult task of developing sound policy 
for american agriculture 
bunting an oak city nc farmer said it was shortsighted 
of bovard to seek their outright removal 
the coalition says it is made up of 42 national state and 
grassroots organizations committed to saving the family farm 
david l senter national director of the american agriculture 
movement said the aam expected that kind of a conclusion to come 
from the book referring to bovards call for an end to farm 
programs 
we think hes off base in his assumptions and analysis of farm 
programs senter said in a telephone interview its one of 
those things that we in agriculture have to deal with from an 
educational standpoint as far as the general public is concerned 
senter was asked about a passage in one of bovards chapters 
listing myths of farm policy one of which in the authors 
view is farm bankruptcy 
hostility to farm bankruptcies stems partly from the notion 
that any clodhopper can be a good farmer so it is a shame to throw 
one fool off the land and put another in his place bovard said 
federal agricultural policy implicitly presumes that the farmers 
currently on the land are the best of all possible farmers and 
that we should pay any price to keep them in possession of their 
farms this is why congress forces the farmers home administration 
to give new loans to farmers who cannot or will not repay previous 
fmha loans 
senter replied you cannot look at a farmer that has operated 
successfully for 20 or 30 years and then all of a sudden figures 
hes become inefficient and is not doing a good job 
he added theres all kinds of things from weather to prices 
to policy theres all kinds of interference in agriculture 
beyond the farmers control that affects his ability to stay on the 
farm 
senter said books such as bovards do not look at the whole 
picture they come from a very narrow biased philosophy against 
farm programs and the authors go to any length to try and make 
that point

the no 2 official in the state department 
predicted the soviet union will not soon allow east germany to 
reunite with west germany despite improved kremlin relations with 
bonns government 
deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger told a senate 
panel that increasing pressure in both germanies to unify may bring 
greater contacts between the nations but that no legal 
reunification will likely result 
i think what you see over the course of the next decade or two 
is an increasing german desire for some form of reunification 
eagleburger said thursday if it comes in any reasonable period of 
time it will come in fact not de jure in law 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev recently completed a state 
visit of west germany that highlighted improved relations between 
the soviet union and bonn gorbachev said during the trip that he 
could envision a day when the berlin wall dividing east and west 
germany could come down 
but eagleburger told the senate foreign relations european 
subcommittee that current political conditions are not ripe to erase 
the borders that were created after world war ii 
there are a lot of countries in western europe and 
certainly in eastern europe who do not contemplate with any joy 
whatsoever a reunified germany he said so that i have great 
difficulty conceiving of a tim when the soviet union in my lifetime 
at least will with equanimity look toward some reunified if neutral 
germany i just dont think thats in the cards for them

the proportion of aids cases transmitted through 
heterosexual contact continues to hold steady at around 4 percent 
according to federal researchers 
the centers for disease control reported thursday that 
heterosexual transmission of aids accounts for 4305 or 44 
percent of the total of 97193 aids cases in the united states 
although the percentage of heterosexual cases has remained 
relatively stable in recent years the characteristics of that 
group are changing the atlantabased agency said citing an 
analysis of the 3962 adults with heterosexual cases of aids through 
march 1989 
prior to 1985 more than half the heterosexual aids cases in the 
united states occurred in people born in other countries such as 
some african nations where heterosexual transmission is the chief 
way aids is spread in the united states most cases are linked to 
homosexual contact 
but since 1985 the majority of heterosexual cases have been in 
people who had sexual contact with a person either infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids or at high risk of 
infection such as an abuser of injectable drugs or a bisexual the 
cdc said 
through march of this year 65 percent of the reported 
heterosexual aids cases occurred in people who had sex with a 
highrisk partner the report said the majority of those partners 
were drug users 
among the 4305 heterosexualtransmission aids patients 2499 
or 58 percent are women women account for only 9 percent of all 
aids patients 
an appreciable proportion of hiv infection among women in the 
united states is acquired through heterosexual contact the cdc 
said in its weekly report because aids infections are more 
prevalent in men a woman is more likely than a man to have an 
infected heterosexual partner 
the cdc noted that the actual number of heterosexual aids cases 
may be higher than 4305 nearly 3000 more aids patients who are 
classified either as bisexual males intravenous drug abusers or 
hemophiliacs also reported heterosexual contact with an aidsrisk 
person 
some of these persons may have acquired hiv through 
heterosexual contact rather than through these other routes the 
cdc said

many female veterans of the vietnam war arent 
collecting their benefits even though they show the same warrelated 
disorders as male veterans witnesses told a congressional panel 
retired rear adm frances sheabuckley chairwoman of the 
department of veterans affairs advisory committee on women veterans 
said a survey found women were routinely excluded from government 
studies of such veterans problems as agent orange contamination and 
posttraumatic stress syndrome 
we also found a general lack of awareness or concern about the 
effects on women of their experiences in the combat theater she 
told a house subcommittee thursday 
we believe the va should address the war experience of women 
who served in vietnam specifically the physical reproductive and 
psychological effects she said 
she said one of the biggest problems in extending benefits to 
female veterans is getting women to admit they served in the armed 
forces 
they dont see themselves as veterans said sheabuckley 
she said veterans hospitals are not setting up proper mental 
health programs for women because few women come forward for help 
it is difficult to provide a true therapeutic community for a 
minority of one or two women she said 
susan mather chief of women veterans programs for the department 
of veterans affairs said several studies have been done on the 
health effects of vietnam service 
results indicate significant differences between women who 
served in vietnam and those who did not she said nearly 27 
percent have had ptsd posttraumatic stress syndrome at some point 
in their lives and an additional 21 percent have some symptoms of 
ptsd 
rep lane evans dill chairman of the veterans affairs 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations called the hearing as 
a followup to the first hearing on the women veterans two years ago 
women have particular problems related to poststress disorder 
and there needs to be particular attention paid to that said 
evans 
women can get all the benefits available to male veterans 
including extensive health care opportunities educational 
assistance and housing loans as long as they have spent one year in 
service said mather 
linda caldwell chairwoman of the advisory commission on women 
veterans in new jersey shared sheabuckleys opinion about getting 
women to come forward as veterans 
she said vietnam era women veterans are particularly reticent 
about identifying themselves 
when pressed for details they often reply id rather forget 
that part of my life she said 
she said world war ii veterans are most vocal about their needs 
primarily nursing care since they are now among the aging population 
the 1980 census the first to ask women if they were veterans 
counted 11 million women had served in the armed forces or 31 
percent of the veteran population women veterans now are believed 
to comprise about 4 percent of the veteran population said mather

the test conducted by the lawrence livermore laboratories for 
the energy department had been scheduled wednesday morning but was

the nations health chief says doctors who 
criticize a bush administrationbacked plan to curb medicare growth 
with annual spending targets are engaged in a deception of the 
american public 
dr louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and 
human services told a group of female physicians thursday an 
american medical association attempt to conjure a picture of 
governmental control and rationing of health care is off base 
that is not correct sullivan said in a speech to the 
american medical womens association they are engaged in a 
deception of the american public 
he said the plan backed by the administration and approved last 
week by a house subcommittee would help reduce growth in physician 
spending under medicare which has been growing by 16 percent a year 
the introduction of medicare reform will help to meet the 
changing landscape of health care in our nation sullivan said 
it is a step that might have been anticipated by americas 
physicians 
sullivan outlined the plan for the american medical association 
in a speech to the groups annual convention earlier this week 
saying it offers a better costcontrol solution than a total 
overhaul of medicare 
but dr james sammons ama executive vice president said the 
plan would result in rationing of medical care 
dr susan c stewart presidentelect of the american medical 
womens association said her group has taken no position on the 
proposed medicare overhaul 
under the plan the government would set an expenditure 
target for medicare physician spending based on the previous 
years spending with adjustments for inflation and the number of 
medicare enrollees if the target is exceeded one year the money 
could be recovered by cutting the next years budget 
the plan also would change the way doctors are reimbursed by 
setting a uniform national fee schedule that would take into account 
the time effort and overhead needed to perform a specific service 
under the schedule family practitioners and other physicians whose 
services are mostly in the form of office visits would see their 
fees rise at the expense of surgeons ophthalmologists and other 
specialists 
a third part of the plan would limit the amount a physician could 
charge a patient above the amount reimbursed by medicare 
sullivan has said the administration would not accept the changes 
in physician payment and balance billing without expenditure 
targets which are aimed at controlling the volume of medical 
services

american airlines and delta air lines said they 
were blindsided by the justice departments opposition to the 
planned merger of their computer reservation systems into one 2 
billion venture 
the airlines ended the attempted merger thursday after the 
justice department threatened to file an antitrust suit alleging the 
joint operation would harm competition in the computerized sale of 
airline tickets 
we explicitly structured the partnership to satisfy the 
previously expressed concerns of several departments of the us 
government about singlecarrier ownership of computer reservation 
systems said robert l crandall chairman and president of 
american 
the proposal to merge the computer reservation systems known as 
crs would have gotten the government off our back said delta 
spokesman william berry we owned our system outright and the 
government had been complaining that single ownership of crs was not 
good 
delta and american had intended to sell up to 50 percent of the 
merged system to other airlines and already had received expressions 
of interest from alaska southwest lufthansa and more than a dozen 
other carriers berry said 
the likely result of this transaction would be higher fares and 
poorer service for airline passengers attorney general dick 
thornburgh said in a statement 
american operates sabre which has 41 percent of the nationwide 
market among the five systems used by airlines and travel agents 
sabre took in 445 million in fees last year the justice department 
said deltas datas ii the smallest of the crs ventures did 68 
million in business last year 
the computer systems the primary channel for the distribution of 
airline tickets provide uptotheminute information about 
schedules fares seat availability hotels car rentals and package 
vacations 
despite a 1986 regulation that says airlines must not favor their 
own flights in computer listings travel agents using a particular 
crs tend to sell a disproportionately high number of tickets on that 
crs owners airline according to judy l whalley acting 
assistant attorney general for the antitrust division 
crandall said american will continue to seek partners for its 
computer system

an environmental coalition is warning that the 
bush administrations clean air proposals would not deal with the 
frequent and pervasive accidental releases of toxic chemicals at 
industrial plants 
chemical accident prevention has not yet become national 
policy gerald v poje of the national clean air coalition told 
the house energy and commerce environment subcommittee thursday 
testimony before the subcommittee focused on the 27 billion 
pounds of toxic chemicals released into the air each year including 
360 million pounds of cancercausing substances 
president bush has proposed legislation to regulate airborne 
toxic chemicals as part of his comprehensive clean air package two 
other versions have been introduced in the house and another has 
been proposed in the senate 
neither bushs language nor a bill introduced by house energy and 
commerce committee chairman john d dingell dmich include 
provisions on accidental spills 
a version introduced by reps mickey leland dtexas and guy 
molinari rny backed by environmental groups and their 
congressional backers would deal with the problem so would the 
senate bill introduced by key members of the senate environment 
committee 
the lelandmolinari legislation would require the environmental 
protection agency to develop a list of substances most likely to 
endanger the public through accidental releases to the air and 
force the agency to issue regulations to prevent such releases the 
senate bill has similar language 
robert c forney a du pont co executive testifying for the 
chemical manufacturers association said the chemical industry 
opposed new legislation on accidental releases because a great 
deal has been done by industry to prevent accidents and we 
dont believe additional legislation is required 
i find it difficult to understand that position said 
subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif who cited 
environmental protection agency figures showing there were more than 
4700 accidental releases between 1980 and 1987 the 120 most 
serious releases killed 145 people injured more than 5000 and 
caused nearly 250000 to evacuate their homes waxman said 
poje said chemical accidents at industrial facilities are 
frequent and pervasive problems while individual impacted 
facilities and communities may learn important lessons from an 
accident and thereby improve safety consciousness it is by no means 
guaranteed under the present system 
industrial facilities and communities are unprepared to 
understand and respond to the consequences of chemical accidents 
he said 
forney also said the nations chemical manufacturers have 
reversed their previous opposition and now support legislation to 
control airborne toxic chemicals as part of new clean air proposals 
we intend to be a constructive player in the legislative 
process he said 
forney said the chemical industrys trade group previously 
believed new legislation was unnecessary but has now concluded the 
environmental protection agency cannot adequately regulate air 
emissions under the existing law 
epa now regulates only seven of the more than 200 toxic chemicals 
released into the air

ohio is asking congress to consider taxing the 
trash that crosses state lines 
the importing of wastes has truly enraged the citizens of 
ohio richard sahli chairman of the ohio solid waste management 
advisory council told a house subcommittee thursday we could 
become the next new jersey in just a few years 
new jersey sends 55 percent of its trash out of the state 
including 15 million tons a year to ohio a state whose landfills 
last year doubled their intake of imported garbage 
sahli said ohio gov richard celeste proposes a 40aton tax on 
garbage shipped long distances 
such a tax would act as an incentive to states to take care of 
their own waste disposal needs and not create potential 
environmental problems in communities located hundreds of miles 
away he said 
the money could be used to encourage recycling develop markets 
for recycled products and to increase environmental protection 
agency funding for research into better ways of handling solid waste 
the garbage shipped to ohio alone would generate more than 100 
million if taxed at the suggested 40aton rate he said 
ohio last year took in 24 million tons of outofstate waste up 
from 12 million tons in 1987 
we simply do not have adequate disposal capacity to become the 
east coasts dumping ground sahli told the house energy and 
commerce transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee 
the natural resources defense council said 15000 landfills have 
closed in the past 10 years leaving about 5000 nationwide all of 
floridas landfills must close within 10 years because of threats to 
groundwater the environmental group testified 
paul templet secretary of the louisiana department of 
environmental quality said that state has 40 landfills down from 
800 in operation in 1980 
solid waste management in louisiana has reached crisis 
proportions said templet who suggested a national recycling 
program and strict landfill guidelines 
rep paul kanjorski dpa said he would introduce legislation 
that would treat trash the same way the government treats lowlevel 
radioactive waste his bill would force states to develop regional 
compacts to deal with the garbage problem collectively 
donald deieso assistant commissioner of the new jersey 
department of environmental protection said the state hopes to end 
all trash exports by 1992 he suggested congress order every state 
to become able to handle its own garbage by a certain date

the chinese government today announced the arrests 
of more student activists and said leaders of the crushed 
prodemocracy movement sought to turn china into a vassal of 
international capitalism 
four student leaders were caught in zhangjiakou a city about 110 
miles northwest of beijing one of them liu fuan of beijing medical 
university was said to have organized health care for students who 
mounted a oneweek hunger strike last may on beijings tiananmen 
square 
zhao yiqiang a teacher at the medical school and his wife were 
detained also arrested was qin weidong a student at beijing iron 
and steel institute he was accused of organizing crowds to set up 
barricades to block the military advance into the city 
troops smashed through the barricades on june 3 killing scores 
of unarmed people as they shot their way toward students occupying 
tiananmen square 
the government has said variously that 200300 people most of 
them soldiers died in the unrest western intelligence reports and 
chinese witnesses say the death toll may have been as high as 3000 
a fifth person a worker accused of beating soldiers and throwing 
stones during the military attack was also arrested in zhangjiakou 
the economic daily reported 
beijing radio said today that 27 people were given prison terms 
for rioting in the southern city of changsha last april in the early 
days of the protest movement it said one of them li weihong was 
given a death sentence with a twoyear reprieve meaning the 
sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment if he behaves well 
for two years 
twentyseven people were executed wednesday and thursday 
including seven in beijing for attacking soldiers and destroying 
military vehicles during the june 34 military push to tiananmen 
square in carrying out the death sentences china has ignored 
international appeals for clemency and international sanctions 
including a cutoff of us military aid 
in washington the us house of representatives on thursday 
unanimously condemned the murderous crackdown and brutal 
repression of the prodemocracy movement and supported president 
bushs call for an end to the executions 
in china today beijing radio also reported the arrest of li bin 
a worker accused of the murder and burning of liu guogeng one of 
the soldiers the government has raised to martyr status in the 
struggle to put down the counterrevolutionary rebellion as the 
protests are now called 
lius father an army veteran who walks with a crutch has been 
shown frequently on statecontrolled television being consoled by 
the nations top leadership 
despite the large numbers of arrests more than 1600 since early 
june the official media insists that the rebellion was perpetrated 
by a small handful of agitators 
the small handful is not identified although dissident fang 
lizhi who is now under the protection of the us embassy is 
included among those branded counterrevolutionary elements 
an editorial in the peoples daily the official voice of the 
communist party said today that class struggle a concept that 
had been in eclipse since the cultural revolution of 196676 was 
still under way we should not lower our vigilance the paper 
said 
during the cultural revolution tens of thousands of people were 
jailed persecuted and killed after they were accused of being class 
enemies 
todays editorial said agitators were taking advantage of an 
international trend of trying to push socialist countries toward 
capitalism 
we must fight against this trend otherwise socialist china 
will be turned into a vassal of international capitalism the 
paper said 
senior leader deng xiaoping after rising to power a decade ago 
played down class struggle and talked instead of economic 
modernization however he appears to have revived the ideological 
line in a bid to smother dissent and hold onto power

history will get a price tag this weekend 
when artifacts from the estate of josiah bartlett a signer of the 
declaration of independence are auctioned by his descendants 
the sale items include an extensive collection of 18th century 
letters and papers a watch cowhide britches and a handpainted vest 
bartlett is said to have worn when he followed john hancock in 
signing the declaration 
ive never done anything of this magnitude and its very very 
exciting said auctioneer martin willis who will handle 
saturdays american history at auction at the bartlett home in 
kingston 
born in 1729 bartlett gave a lifetime of public service as 
doctor judge governor from 1790 to 1794 and founder of the new 
hampshire medical society 
he signed the articles of confederation which governed the 
nation after the revolutionary war and played a role in new 
hampshires decisive ratification of the us constitution in june 
1788 which replaced the articles 
we think he was an extraordinary man who gave of himself 
extraordinarily said state archivist frank mevers 
one of the more unusual sale items is an apothecary chest with 
bartletts handwritten labels intact as well as some of the 
medicines he used as a physician according to willis the 
historical value of the chest as well as pieces of period furniture 
kept in the bartlett house built in 1774 makes it difficult to 
predict what prices they will bring he said 
but bartletts papers are even more difficult to value willis 
said the smithsonian institution made one of a flood of inquiries 
from around the nation about the documents and the state has set 
aside 1 million to buy some of the papers 
they include a 1743 copy book from bartletts school days in 
amesbury mass where he was born official correspondence marking 
the surrender of proud cornwallis to the illustrious washington 
at yorktown to end the american revolution a 1748 receipt for 
payments to the families of two soldiers and an indian killed near 
concord during the french and indian war bartletts charter for 
the new hampshire medical society and a copy of a handwritten 
biography of josiah bartlett by his son levi 
mevers said state historians see the documents which include 
records kept by bartletts descendants after his death in 1795 as 
an excellent account of early new hampshire life 
thats what makes them so unusual and so inestimable in 
value he said in a recent interview bartletts 
greatgreatgreatgreat granddaughter ruth ready says she has 
struggled with having to part with meticulously kept family history 
ready 38 owns the home with her 71yearold aunt janet donahue 
of new rochelle ny who wanted to sell the estate ready hopes to 
buy her aunts half of the house with her share of the auction 
proceeds 
pausing before a delicatelooking 18th century duckfoot table 
ready described how it was saved from a fire that destroyed the 
original bartlett house in february 1774 the present house was 
built later that year 
the main reason i always liked it was because it has some 
history said ready a postal clerk when i grew up i wasnt 
looking at it like a piece of furniture that could be worth a lot of 
money it was more to me

president bush says hell enforce the supreme 
courts ban on flag desecration laws but he doesnt like it one bit 
bush returned to the white house late thursday after a day trip 
to new york where he mixed politics with a patriotic call to all 
americans to join his crusade for volunteerism 
he made clear his distaste for the supreme courts 54 ruling 
striking down the 48 state laws against flag burning and other 
desecration 
the president told 1000 business leaders he understands the 
legal basis for the ruling and will see that the law of the land 
is fully supported but i have to give you my personal emotional 
response flag burning is wrong dead wrong 
bushs distaste for the ruling was matched in congress as a 
bipartisan senate passed a resolution condemning the supreme court 
decision 
congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag is 
clearly not speech as protected by the first amendment said the 
resolution which passed 973 
sens edward m kennedy of massachusetts and howard metzenbaum of 
ohio both democrats and gordon humphrey of new hampshire a 
republican were the only dissenters 
sen strom thurmond rsc summed up the majority mood we 
must stand for america the flag the flag america america for 
us 
at a new york republican fundraising dinner later thursday bush 
urged the gop to press for big legislative gains in albany and 
other capitals to keep the democrats from rigging congressional 
district lines after the 1990 census 
it is absolutely essential that we block the gerrymandering 
ways of the democratic party in all 50 states he said theyve 
done it to us in the past and we cant let them do it to us again 
bush also exhorted the faithful to wrest control of the most 
powerful local office in america from incumbent new york mayor ed 
koch he tried to play no favorites in the threeman republican 
field in septembers primary but stumbled and mispronounced the 
name of frontrunner rudolph giuliani the former top us attorney 
in gotham 
sorry rudy he apologized 
the exprosecutor vying against ron lauder and herbert london 
laughed it off saying if you havent taken latin sometimes the 
name giuliani can be a little difficult 
bush capped his new york visit with a stop at a blacktie banquet 
marking the 100th anniversary of the wall street journal he hailed 
the business newspaper as one of americas most trusted 
publications but quipped that the thing he really liked about it 
is you dont carry doonesbury that comic strip has taken 
frequent shots at bush over the years 
bush also seized the occasion to repeat his pitch to corporate 
america to enlist in a new crusade to bring national service into 
every corner of america 
bushs return from new york was delayed a half hour by an 
accident involving containers of dangerous chemicals near newark 
international airport that led him to detour in the fog to new 
yorks kennedy airport containers of two toxic and potentially 
explosive chemicals overturned while being loaded on trucks next to 
the newark airport but never spilled officials said 
air force one was flown to the other airport and bushs motorcade 
was held up at the banquet as the secret service plotted a new path 
out of new york 
earlier bush elaborated on plans for a publicprivate foundation 
called the points of light initiative to spearhead the push for 
volunteerism and he chatted with youths who have spent years living 
on the streets and now have found shelter at father bruce ritters 
covenant house 
barbara bush joined him at the shelter cradling one young 
womans threeweekold baby 
at one point in the unusual rap session when a boy told the 
president he could make a 100 in 15 minutes peddling drugs 
mrs bush remarked that the same boy had said earlier that selling 
drugs led to jail death and whatever the third choice was 
doesnt always happen though the boy replied 
mrs bush said the priest the kids are bulletproof 
oh i forgot that said the first lady 
new jersey gov tom kean named by bush to head an advisory 
committee for his points of light initiative said the emphasis on 
voluntary service is a shift obviously away from the great society 
because what its saying is clearly there are limits to what 
government can do 
bush is pledged to seek 25 million a year for four years for the 
foundation from congress but his director of national service c 
gregg petersmeyer emphasized this isnt bricksandmortar 
this is a movement

dozens of antiabortion demonstrators say theyre 
prepared to spend a year in jail rather than promise not to blockade 
abortion clinics for two years a defense lawyer said 
were willing to face the consequences attorney thomas 
olmstead said thursday 
police prepared for a possible confrontation at the district 
court in adjacent bellevue where up to 50 faced sentencing today on 
criminal trespass charges for attempting to block an abortion clinic 
on nov 12 
fifty officers were placed on call and protesters were expected 
to come from as far away as california said maj paul olson head 
of the bellevue police department patrol division 
the security is partly in response to dozens of angry letters 
judge joel rindal has received from abortion foes olson said 
an an initial sentencing hearing in april rindal stunned the 
protesters when he said he would sentence them to the maximum 
penalty of 5000 in fines and a year in jail unless they promised 
not to commit the same offense for two years he gave them two 
months to make up their minds 
more than 40 defendants say theyll choose jail time olmstead 
said 
throughout the bible there are instances where the law of god 
was more important than the laws of man he said martin luther 
king broke the law throughout the south because he believed gods 
law was higher than the law of alabama 
olmstead said protesters believe god is on our side 
theres no question what ill do i dont have a choice but to 
go to jail jim demers who is defending himself in the case told 
the journalamerican a bellevue newspaper 
another defendant kenneth bridges said he would give up his 
45000ayear oil refinery job and go to jail if necessary 
in good conscience i couldnt promise a judge i wouldnt 
commit another rescue for two years he told the newspaper the 
protesters claim their blockade was an attempt to rescue fetuses 
from abortion 
but some defendants said they would promise not to break the law 
because of family obligations 
the harm psychologically and emotionally to my children would 
be greater than any good i could do in jail for a year defendant 
pat landwhr said but she said she was willing to spend as long as 
50 days in jail rather than pay a possible fine of 1000 
i will not pay for the privilege of protesting in this 
country she said

gov mario cuomo urged the legislature to 
adopt a punishment of life without parole after lawmakers 
indefinitely postponed an attempt to override his latest veto of a 
death penalty bill 
state senate majority leader ralph marino said thursday he was 
postponing an override vote because of new cancer surgery for sen 
james donovan 
a consistent death penalty supporter in the past donovan stunned 
his colleagues last week when he said his bout with cancer had 
caused him to have second thoughts about capital punishment 
the bills chief sponsor sen dale volker has said donovans 
support was crucial to winning an override vote in the senate 
the chief assembly sponsor of the bill democrat vincent graber 
said the postponement effectively put off a showdown on the issue 
until next year when all 211 legislative seats and the governorship 
go before the voters 
new york governors have vetoed legislation to reinstitute the 
death penalty every year since 1977 
after learning of the postponement cuomo issued a statement 
appealing for quick passage of legislation for life without parole 
for murderers 
with senators unable to override his veto the democratic 
governor said it is incumbent on them to explain what steps they 
can take to provide the people of this state particularly its 
police officers with a tougher penalty for the worst crimes 
the legislature is expected to end its regular 1989 session at 
the end of next week 
new yorks electric chair hasnt been used since 1963 
for the past four years the republicancontrolled senate has 
voted to override cuomos death penalty vetoes but the effort has 
fallen short repeatedly in the democraticcontrolled assembly 
this year death penalty supporters felt they were within one 
vote of winning in the assembly before problems began appearing in 
the senate

when word reached iceland that the us 
military planned largescale maneuvers beginning june 17 the 
underlying strains of antiamericanism surfaced on this fiercely 
independent island nation 
june 17 is icelands national day and the us forces had to 
delay the start of their exercises by three days because of an angry 
11hour debate in the icelandic parliament and a warning from prime 
minister steingrimur hermansson that the timing of the maneuvers was 
unwise 
foreign minister jon baldvin hannibalsson also scaled down the 
maneuvers from 1300 to 1000 reservists to allay parliamentary 
outcry over a us officers erroneous description of the exercises 
as the largest in iceland since world war ii 
in this strategically important north atlantic country proud of 
its independence reliance on the american military for defense 
draws gratitude from some and rancor from others 
iceland is the only member of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization with no army or navy under the nato treaty the 
iceland defense force is allamerican 
with 250000 inhabitants kentuckysized iceland has no interest 
in raising its own army and the suggestion often sparks astonishment 
and laughter 
we are this unique nation that tries to maintain its 
independence without any military force hannibalsson said in a 
recent interview 
when iceland won independence from denmark in 1944 most people 
saw little point in establishing an army he explained who was it 
going to deter 
in world war ii the british beat the germans to iceland and 
turned over its defense to the americans 
col andrew duncan of the international institute of strategic 
studies in london said iceland was a rather large aircraft 
carrier halfway between europe and north america it is also on 
soviet submarine routes into the north atlantic 
the american presence is no longer the issue it was in the 
1970s but it is still viewed with ambivalence 
at the governments request enlisted servicemen in the 
3300strong american force have a midnight to 6 am curfew armed 
forces television is also barred from broadcasting outside the nato 
base at keflavik 31 miles south of reykjavik where the americans 
live 
three of icelands four major parties have consistently backed 
the american presence but a september 1987 poll of 1753 people by 
the university of iceland found just 41 percent wanted the americans 
to stay thirty three percent wanted them to leave and 26 percent 
said they didnt care 
by contrast over 80 percent consistently support icelands 
membership in nato 
opposition to the us military is led by a vocal leftwing 
minority 
we have been very unfriendly to them said gudrun 
helgadottir president of icelands parliament the althing and a 
member of the leftwing peoples alliance 
the alliance part of the threeparty centerleft coalition 
government believes the us presence makes iceland a military 
target and endangers icelands culture and language she said 
incidents like the timing of this weeks military maneuvers by 
us reservists from westover air force base in massachusetts bring 
to light the icelanders sensitivities 
all of a sudden it was a matter of national honor not to have 
those exercises on national independence day and all of a sudden 
people discovered they were a disgrace because now were living in a 
period of disarmament and peace hannibalsson said 
he gave the goahead for the exercise codenamed northern viking 
89 but changed the dates to june 2028 he said it was far from 
the largest held here and was similar to maneuvers in 1985 and 1987 
which he said nobody noticed 
last month iceland officially protested a farewell speech by the 
outgoing us commander rear adm eric mcvadon in which he urged 
icelanders who support the american forces to speak out mcvadon 
also implied that icelandic authorities were ungrateful to us 
troops 
a usnato request to build a second airport in northern iceland 
has also aroused critics who fear a military buildup 
hannibalsson said he will decide in a few months whether to 
authorize a feasibility study if iceland says no greenland has 
expressed willingness to have the airport

three highranking cuban military officers 
were arrested in a drug investigation ordered by president fidel 
castro after the united states said his country helps drug 
traffickers the official cuban news agency said 
prensa latina added that cuba is ready to take drastic 
measures against drug smugglers including shooting down suspected 
airplanes using cuban airspace 
in an unusually detailed report thursday the agency praised the 
government for uprooting the evil of drug trafficking it also 
acknowledged that cuba is not immune from a problem that afflicts 
much of the hemisphere 
the investigation undertaken in april resulted in the june 12 
arrest of two generals and a colonel accused of acting as middlemen 
for a colombian cocaine cartel based in medellin 
prensa latina said castro ordered the investigation because the 
us charges added weight to information from friends of cuba 
that drug traffickers could count on the cooperation of cuban 
officials 
even though it is habitual in the united states to give room to 
all sorts of slanders against the cuban revolution the coincidences 
of the past several months caught the attention of president fidel 
castro prensa latina said 
the report said maj gen arnaldo ochoa brig gen patricio de 
la guardia and col antonio de la guardia collaborated for the 
last three years in the movement of drugs from south america to the 
united states using their authority and official functions 
the news agency said the officials admitted delivering about six 
tons of cocaine and said they were paid 34 million for their 
efforts 
prensa latina said the cocaine arrived in cuba in small airplanes 
and was transferred to miamibound boats by the cuban accomplices 
it said the cuban involvement began in 1986 when ochoa acted as 
cubas military liaison with other nations it said a panamanian 
connection put ochoa in touch with a north american citizen of 
italian origin named frank morfa 
it said morfa suggested a moneylaundering scheme that in turn 
led to involvement with the medellin cartel reputedly the worlds 
largest cocaine smuggling ring 
the arrested officers have been charged with disloyalty to the 
people the revolution and the national ethic

the bush administration endorsed landmark 
legislation to bring millions of disabled americans into societys 
mainstream but has disagreements over several specific provisions 
we must end the anomaly of widely protecting women and 
minorities from discrimination while failing to provide parallel 
protection for people with disabilities attorney general dick 
thornburgh said thursday 
thornburgh told the senate labor and human resources committee 
the administration was prepared to work in good faith toward a 
consensus on areas of concern 
those areas included the scope of the public accommodations 
provisions the size of businesses covered by the employment 
discrimination section and the inclusion of punitive damages as a 
legal remedy he said 
but the attorney general and representatives of disabledrights 
groups played down the disagreements over the proposed americans 
with disabilities act 
its a historic day the administration and the legislature for 
mainstreaming disabled people said evan kemp jr a member of the 
us equal employment opportunity commission this is the first 
administration that has ever taken a disability bill seriously 
i dont see any potential major areas of disagreement said 
pat wright washington director of the disabled rights education and 
defense fund 
david runkel thornburghs chief spokesman said there are some 
differences but added that i dont think anybody sees theres 
any insolvable problem at this time 
the bill would prohibit employment discrimination against people 
with disabilities by business with more than 15 employees 
it would also require theaters restaurants and public offices to 
make reasonable accommodations to improve access for disabled 
persons that are readily achievable without posing an undue 
hardship on businesses 
new buses purchased by public transit authorities would be 
required to be equipped with wheelchair lifts 
we are firmly committed to the notion that every new bus 
purchased by public transit authorities in the united states should 
be fully accessible period thornburgh said 
what has to be examined is the coverage of the public 
accommodations language how many public accommodations are covered 
will depend to a great extend on the definition thats given to 
reasonable accommodation thornburgh said 
i hope that kind of examination will be at the top of the list 
that should be considered in reaching some specificity of 
definitions thornburgh said

edmund and mary malzan remember when the 
cuyahoga river was clean enough to swim and fish in then dirty 
enough to catch fire 
its changed a lot since ive been here last it sure looks 
good to me now said malzan who lives about 50 miles southeast of 
cleveland and last visited the river about five years ago 
the couple stood on the riverbank near downtown thursday and 
watched the festivities marking the 20th anniversary of a pollution 
fire on the cuyahoga that made the city the brunt of countless jokes 
nationwide 
its built up now said mrs malzan it looks as if 
somebody cares 
about 100 people gathered at the riverbank to commemorate the 
anniversary some stressed they also were celebrating the areas 
resolve to render the waterway freer of oil chemicals and debris 
dumped from this industrial city 
we americans tended to see the natural world as unlimited most 
people probably never thought much about where the waste went 
said greg studen chairman of the cuyahoga river community planning 
organization the fire in the cuyahoga river helped to destroy 
that naive and outdated view forever 
as he spoke firefighters on the anthony j celebrezze the same 
fireboat that extinguished the 1969 blaze nabbed a fish from the 
river and held the dripping net and fish up for all to see 
absent from the ceremonies was mayor george voinovich whose 
administration at first refused to release the fireboat for the 
event the city feared it would resurrect some of the razzing the 
city has endured 
on june 22 1969 a burning pile of unspecified debris 
apparently soaked with industrial contaminants already in the river 
was floating near a norfolk amp western railroad trestle the wooden 
trestle then caught fire 
local officials speculated a train rolling over the trestle 
tracks sparked the fire in the river 
the fire caused about 50000 in damage but some say more 
extensive damage was wrought as the public conjured visions of 
burning waters amid the citys steel chemical and cement factories 
the following year songwriter randy newman penned burn on in 
tribute to the cuyahoga fire 
the cuyahoga a winding 100mile river that begins about 30 
miles northeast of cleveland and empties into lake erie also had a 
surface fire in 1936 and two in the 1950s 
but sewage plants have been upgraded discharge laws are tougher 
and the steel plants dont produce the same volume as in the 1960s 
john olive a university of akron biology professor and a 
specialist in river water quality said analyses show more aquatic 
life fish mayflies and other insects are thriving at the same 
time midges leeches and other indicators of pollution are 
decreasing he said 
near downtown cleveland patrons can sip drinks from riverside 
restaurants and watch pleasure boats skip across the river 
about 15 billion has been spent by local government 
businesses civic groups and others determined to change the face of 
the cuyahoga and make the 1969 fire stand for the day cleveland got 
tough said jim cox a local businessman who works with a remedial 
action group trying to clean up the river 
it was used nationally as a symbol for the environmental 
movement it had very strong impact in getting the epa started 
cox said its a cleaner river more friendly to aquatic life and 
human life

colleagues today puzzled over 
why a gunman in a pickup truck fired on a vehicle carrying three 
churchwomen seriously wounding an american nun 
sister mary stanislaus mackey 73 suffered a shattered cheek 
bone when she was shot wednesday evening said the rev ken myers a 
fellow roman catholic church worker he said she may lose sight in 
her left eye 
the nun who was at policlinica hospital had regained 
consciousness and communicated with others by writing notes her 
colleague said 
an american plane today is to fly her to houston where her order 
the sisters of charity of the incarnate word is based myers said 
in a telephone interview 
sister mackey a native of ireland is a naturalized us 
citizen she had worked in central america since 1963 and in el 
salvador since 1983 
witnesses and authorities say one of several men in a pickup 
truck opened fire on another pickup truck that carried sister mackey 
and two other nuns outside zaragoza a town 10 miles south of the 
capital 
sister mackey a registered nurse worked at a zaragoza home for 
orphans founded by myers it shelters about 200 orphans of the 
nineyear civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government 
sister ana maria brangan who was driving the pickup with the two 
other nuns said they were approaching zaragoza from the capital 
when a yellow pickup carrying at least six men four of them in the 
back pulled alongside 
they stayed alongside and pulled closer and i didnt 
understand what was going on then i heard a noise and thought they 
had bumped us i didnt realize it was a bullet she told 
reporters at the hospital 
she said the other nun sister juana flores saw a man standing 
in the back fire a single pistol shot 
she said she stopped the truck and the attackers stopped just 
ahead however when she started they fled 
there were at least six men in the truck and only one weapon 
they may have been thieves maybe they were drunk myers said 
in 1980 four american churchwomen were murdered by five national 
guard troops and the united states temporarily suspended aid to the 
salvadoran government in protest 
the five were convicted of murder and sentenced in 1984 to 30 
years imprisonment 
extreme rightists and some armed forces officers consider nuns 
priests and other churchpeople who work in poor communities to be 
guerrilla sympathizers 
myers said his colleagues have not been directly threatened but 
have been accused of being leftist sympathizers that kind of 
thing happens all the time because of the kind of work we do the 
orphanage bringing in medicine a clinic for poor people he said 
cpl asencio mejia of the zaragoza civil defense which is 
handling the preliminary investigation said no suspects had been 
found 
us ambasador william walker said he will press officials to find 
the attackers

stephen hyde chief executive for donald trumps two casinos in 
atlantic city said it is not in our best interests to have a 
drunk sitting at a gaming table making a fool of himself 
trumps casinos will stop serving an intoxicated customer he 
said 
wagner said cocktail waitresses who stroll casino floors will ask 
customers if they want any complimentary coffee juice or soda we 
do not solicit free alcoholic beverages he said but if a 
customer says he wants a beer instead of juice he can have it 
casinos are the best whipping boy theyre so visible and 
exciting he said you know johnson amp johnson makes drugs if 
someone took too many should they be held accountable 
wise said many gamblers will not drink alcoholic beverages 
because it dilutes the decisionmaking process 
lois szabo of new brunswick sipping a pina colada at trump plaza 
hotel and casino thursday concurred she said she and most casino 
customers are more interested in gambling than drinking you get 
so caught up in the slots that you actually forget to take a drink 
but some customers might take advantage of the decision because 
some people would do anything to sue ms szabo said 
personally everybody should be able to control themselves with 
liquor when some people drink excessively they should be 
responsible for their own actions 
the judges decision issued wednesday stemmed from a lawsuit 
between a casino and a customer who lost 200000 shmuel aboud of 
new york said casino officials plied him with free alcohol and 
painkillers for his aching back 
the ruling will allow a court case to continue toward a finding 
of whether the casino was responsible for abouds losses 
gus sunday of philadelphia who visits atlantic citys casinos 
about twice a month said he has never seen a fellow gambler 
intoxicated 
anybody who would get drunk has his own problems its not the 
casinos problem he said people who come to atlantic city are 
not kids they should have enough sense to know when to say no

a lava flow that destroyed a visitor 
center at hawaii volcanoes national park is no longer an imminent 
threat to an ancient hawaiian temple a park spokesman said 
the wooden visitor center burst into flames late thursday 
afternoon after molten rock from erupting kilauea volcano crept 
beneath the raised structure said park spokesman jon erickson 
firefighters on hawaii island had pumped more than 18000 gallons 
of water onto the lava flow in a futile effort to save the building 
erickson said 
it would cost about 60000 to replace the building that housed 
an information office museum and restrooms he said 
park officials had feared the lava would next claim the temple 
called the wahaula heiau which was built in 1275 and sits on a 
bluff 50 yards south of the center 
but the lava some 25 to 30 feet below the temple was moving to 
the west posing no immediate danger to the temple erickson said 
no other structures are in the flows path he added 
the eruption began jan 3 1983 from a vent 2000 feet up 
kilauea and seven miles from the visitor center 
lava from the eruption has destroyed 68 homes including four 
last month in the lavaravaged royal gardens subdivision above the 
visitor center 
meanwhile the worlds most active volcano continued to pump out 
half a million cubic meters of lava per day said reggie okamura 
chief of operations at the us geological surveys hawaiian volcano 
observatory

dismissed thursday morning by cappellini

more than 620000 in pay in the 15 months ending march 1987 when 
bakker resigned in a sex and money scandal 
james taggart received nearly 300000 during that period when 
he was ptls interior decorator 
us district judge robert potter asked some potential jurors if 
they contributed regularly to a church or a religious organization 
he also asked if they were familiar with brand names such as gucci 
jaguar cartier and mercedesbenz he then asked if they buy 
clothing and jewelry in discount stores or expensive shops and if 
they normally pay with cash credit cards or checks

a confessed murderer was put to death 
today by lethal ejection for the slayings of two men he thought were 
homosexuals 
sean patrick flanagan 28 had refused to seek appeals of his 
death penalty for the 1987 killings in las vegas one of his victims 
was dismembered 
after he was strapped to a gurney at the nevada state prison 
flanagan lifted his head and told the man who prosecuted him i 
love you he was declared dead at 209 am 
flanagan was the fourth person put to death in nevada and the 
114th nationally since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing 
states to resume use of the death penalty he was the second person 
executed this week in nevada 
before he died flanagan also told deputy clark county district 
attorney dan seaton you are a just man 
he has said it before said seaton who witnessed the 
execution he means it in terms of christian love and 
forgiveness 
a lastminute bid by the american civil liberties union of nevada 
to intervene in his behalf was rejected late thursday by gov robert 
miller 
im paying my debt to society flanagan said in an interview 
wednesday if i had to live id live i do not have that choice 
every man who has committed a crime of murder knows deep down 
inside he should die for taking another mans life he said 
these men have no right to life 
flanagan apologized to the families of his victims for the 
horrible burdens ive put in their lives i hope theyll understand 
my execution is proper and just 
flanagan said he became involved in homosexual activity while in 
the marines 
im just as wicked and nasty as ted bundy i believe if i had 
not been arrested i would have ended up being another ted bundy 
against homosexuals said flanagan 
bundy was executed earlier this year in florida after admitting 
to the serial killings of women throughout the country 
but flanagan said he is no longer violenceprone after giving 
my life to jesus i couldnt hurt anybody again he said 
flanagan provided a rambling sevenpage statement in which he 
said he hated his homosexuality he said it was difficult for him to 
determine what made him kill homosexual men but the thought that 
i would be doing some good for our society crossed my mind 
flanagan spent thursday with family members and a minister said 
warden pete demosthenes 
the first of his victims befriended him bought him some clothes 
and got him a room flanagan said james lewandowski a 45yearold 
chef was strangled and dismembered the body parts were put in 
plastic bags and tossed into a trash bin near the motel the remains 
were never recovered 
four days later he said he strangled pianist albert duggins 59 
after duggins offered him a ride and flanagan concluded the man was 
homosexual 
flanagan was arrested in orange calif for jaywalking shortly 
after duggins death and voluntarily returned to las vegas where he 
led detectives to the mans body in a vacant lot

the defense ministry today denied that 13 
men arrested in china on charges of promoting the prodemocracy 
movement were spies for taiwan 
the ministry said in a statement that the accusations were 
chinas conventional way of framing people with false charges 
rather than a fact 
communist china announced the arrests thursday it said the 13 
men all chinese nationals were recruited by military intelligence 
officers of taiwans nationalist government or by local agents 
chinas national television news showed videotapes of some of the 
accused men mixing with demonstrators during prodemocracy rallies 
in beijing before the june 34 military crackdown the television 
also showed secret codes letters and invisible ink it said were 
used by the men 
taiwans masscirculation china times quoted an unidentified 
nationalist intelligence officer as saying that although taiwan 
maintains agents on the mainland they long ago stopped using secret 
codes and invisible ink 
nationalist legislator chien hansheng said china intended to 
divert mainland peoples anger and indignation over the 
crackdown by putting the blame for the turmoil on taiwan 
the chinese nationalist government fled to taiwan following its 
1949 defeat by communist forces in a civil war 
the nationalists remain technically at war with the communists 
but recently adopted a more flexible policy that allows visits 
across the strait separating the two nations and trade through third 
countries

the central committee of hungarys 
deeply split communist party met today as some progressives called 
for the replacement of centrist party chief karoly grosz 
the state news agency mti in a terse report announced only that 
the meeting had started and that the committee was working on 
preparations for a party congress this fall 
on thursday the reformminded speaker of parliament matyas 
szueroes appeared to lend his voice to calls from other reformers 
inside the ruling party for a replacement of grosz he took up the 
post of party general secretary 13 months ago 
szueroes did not criticize grosz by name but according to mti 
he said the communist party could only work for national integration 
if the reform wing unambiguously takes the upper hand and the key 
positions are filled by popular and intelligent leaders of the 
reform wing 
szueroes remarks followed calls from at least five party reform 
groups for groszs ouster and a caretaker leadership under 
reformers control until the fall congress 
the central ground that grosz tried to stake out has eroded as 
the divisions between reformers and more orthodox communists become 
increasingly evident 
imre poszgay a minister of state and politburo member who is the 
countrys leading communist reformer said thursday that the 
113member policymaking central committee would be told to keep 
grosz on as party leader until the congress 
but he said anything might happen given the fluid situation in 
hungarian politics 
democratic reforms have advanced rapidly since grosz became party 
leader in may 1988 
this week the communists and democratic opposition groups agreed 
to work out plans for multiparty elections 
a week ago imre nagy and once reviled fellow leaders of the 
failed 1956 uprising against stalinism were buried after a 
nationally televised mourning ceremony attended by pozsgay szueroes 
and up to a quarter of a million hungarians

millions of households are expected to face 
higher water bills because of new federal rules that are designed to 
make water safer to drink says the environmental protection agency 
the epa announced new regulations thursday which will require 
local water authorities serving an estimated 150 million people to 
rid drinking water of a variety of germs that are annually blamed 
for 90000 illnesses including diarrhea nausea and upset stomachs 
about a third of the nearly 10000 water systems subject to the 
new requirements will have to install new filtration equipment or 
make other expensive adjustments over the next four years to comply 
with the federal requirements 
in many cases local authorities will be given up to four years to 
install the equipment required by the new federal water standards 
said epa spokesman dave ryan 
the communities that already use filtration as a way of 
decontaminating their drinking water may have to make other less 
costly adjustments such as improving their chemical treatment 
procedures the agency said 
the epa estimated the new requirements will cost 3 billion 
overall for initial equipment and add about 500 million a year to 
operating costs these costs are expected to be passed on to water 
customers 
the increases in household water bills are likely to vary widely 
depending on the size of the public water system and whether the 
system already has some filtration equipment in some cases 
compliance to the regulations will require modest adjustments while 
others will need entirely new filtration systems 
in communities where water systems serve fewer than 500 customers 
and where no filtration is now used household water bills could 
increase as much as 30 to 50 a month the epa estimated the 
increases in urban areas where the cost may be more widely 
distributed are likely to be about 6 a month or less if some 
filtration equipment already is being used the epa said 
these rules are a major step forward in providing maximum 
protection for our nations drinkingwater supplies said epa 
administrator william k reilly 
the regulations which apply only to communities where drinking 
water comes from surface sources such as rivers and streams are 
aimed at reducing the risk of illness from microscopic living 
organisms such as viruses bacteria and protozoa 
the epa estimated americans are subjected to tens of thousands of 
illnesses annually from such waterborne germs and that those 
estimates might be low because such illnesses often go unreported or 
are not linked to water contamination 
the agency said estimated 90000 such illnesses could be avoided 
each year because of the improvements 
the epa said more than 21 million people get water from systems 
that use no filtration including residents of boston new york 
city newark nj san francisco and seattle 
other cities listed by the epa as not filtering their drinking 
water were portland maine syracuse and utica ny scranton 
bethlehem and wilkesbarre pa greenville sc reno and sparks 
nev tacoma wash and portland ore

in a summer school program that could 
really take off students filled tissue paper balloons with hot air 
built gliders and rigged eggs with parachutes to learn the mysteries 
of flight 
its really not like school said julie taylor a 9yearold 
sky school cadet its fun because you get to make your own 
airplanes and balloons and fly them 
taylor was one of 100 fourth through 11thgraders who postponed 
their summer break for one week to participate in the nasainspired 
program 
it was to end today with a hotair balloon contest and a 
softlanding competition in which students will try to drop a 
onepound package containing an egg and suspended from a parachute 
from a secondstory window without breaking the egg 
my first attempt was a complete disaster basically said 
marcel malfregeot 13 as he proudly displayed his entry a small 
white box wrapped in bubbly plastic packing material 
this time ive got a box inside of a box and the egg is totally 
surrounded by oatmeal which is a good shock absorber 
other cadets launched brightly colored gliders or compared models 
of real aircraft they built 
each one of the students has been in the cockpit of an airplane 
and learned how to work the controls said thelma nutter a 
kindergarten teacher who spent a week at nasas sky school in 
orlando fla to prepare for the program 
students from 10 counties in northcentral west virginia 
participated in the program 
the only problem as i see it is that it wasnt long enough 
said bob beckwith a randolph county science teacher we had 
enough material left over to run the school for another 10 days

a former baby sitter joined witnesses testifying 
that actor william hurt called sandra jennings his wife but none 
has referred to the four weeks on which the former ballerina is 
basing her claim for a commonlaw marriage 
linda patrick testified thursday that she and hurt went to lunch 
with hurts and jennings son alexander in the summer of 1985 
how do you like working with my wife she quoted hurt as 
asking 
however the value of patricks testimony isnt clear state 
supreme court justice jacqueline silbermann who is hearing the case 
without a jury has said what matters is what happened in south 
carolina during four weeks between dec 9 1982 when hurt learned 
that his divorce from actress mary beth hurt was final and the time 
he and jennings left the state jan 19 1983 
south carolina recognizes commonlaw marriages new york does not 
jennings is seeking to have the court declare she and hurt are 
married so she can get a divorce and a share of his assets 
estimated by her lawyer a richard golub to be about 10 million 
jennings 32 says hurt introduced her to people in beaufort 
sc where he was filming the big chill as his wife but no 
testimony or other evidence has been offered to support that 
assertion 
earlier in the day dr barbara ann barker who was hurts 
ophthalmologist and the wife of one of the actors lawyers

in cambodia a thai official said 
paynai sirirat a senior thai border official said peter l pond

site 8 camp located on the thaicambodian frontier the official 
could not confirm whether the guman was a khmer rouge soldier 
pond was taken to a bangkok hospital where a nurse said he was in 
the emergency room for xrays she declined to give more details 
saying the us embassy had asked the hospital not to talk with 
reporters about the case 
sirirat said pond and the gunman quarreled before the shooting

refugees and adopted several cambodian children 
he helped cambodian buddhist monks build a temple at the refugee 
camp and planned to set up a buddhist school

the guerrillas claim they have renounced their radical ways but 
western aid organizations human rights groups and others say their

ministers set up a commission to outline improvements for novy uzen 
a city of 56000 people where arson and other attacks began last

station in the area on thursday and that many workers in novy uzen 
where the four people died were staying away from work

factory and office employees showed up for work thursday only a 
bakery and food shops operated normally pravda said 
the rioters have demanded that all members of caucasus ethnic 
groups be evicted from novy uzen more than onethird of the 
population is from the caucasus 
native kazakhs complain the caucasus settlers dominate the oil 
industry jobs on which the city depends and receive preferential 
treatment in housing and other benefits 
the rioters also complain the settlers have set up private 
businesses that sell supplies in the desert city for exhorbitant 
prices 
tass said cooperatives found guilty of abuses would be closed it 
did not detail what other measures would be taken but quoted deputy 
premier oktyabr i zheltikov as saying that rapid development of the 
oil and gas industry had led to shortages of housing and food in 
novy uzen 
the socialeconomic package under consideration recalled similar 
pledges authorities made to quell rioting in another region of 
central asia the fergana valley of uzbekistan an uzbek government 
commission on monday outlined plans to create 200000 jobs clean up

police are conducting spot checks 
of cars and vans approaching frankfurts airport as part of 
increased security measures imposed after a recent threat of a 
terrorist attack an official said today 
west german officials this month stepped up police protection at 
the airport continental europes busiest after receiving a tip 
that palestinian terrorists were planning to attack an airline 
flying out of frankfurt 
frankfurt airport has been especially crowded recently as foreign 
tourists begin to flood europe and as west germans start leaving on 
summer vacations 
some security experts say they believe the bomb that downed pan 
am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland in december was smuggled on 
board in frankfurt west german officials deny that 
a highranking west german police official assigned to the 
airport detail said today that officers began checking some motor 
vehicles approaching the airport terminal at the beginning of the 
month 
the steppedup measures including the checks of cars and vans 
will stay in effect as long as the security situation is what it is 
now said the official who spoke to the associated press on the 
condition of anonymity 
the checks sometimes include searches of automobile trunks while 
police also question drivers and ask to see documents such as the 
vehicle registration 
at one of the two airport checkpoints police were flagging down 
automobiles whose occupants appeared to be of middle east origin 
the majority of the approaching vehicles were waved through 
a halfdozen officers some wearing bulletproof vests and one 
carrying an automatic rifle stood at the checkpoint 
one of the checkpoints was just 110 yards from the terminal 
building on an approach ramp while the other was 330 yards away on 
another approach ramp 
other noticeable changes in security included police officers 
standing at curbs to ensure drivers moved their cars immediately 
after dropping off or picking up passengers 
armed police officers are constantly on patrol while an armored 
personnel carrier stands at the corner of the terminal building 
alongside the busiest approach ramp 
officials have refused to say how many police are patrolling the 
airport 
christian jaletzke a spokesman for the hesse state interior 
ministry told the ap the steppedup security measures will be in 
place as long as necessary 
jaletzke whose ministry oversees police functions in frankfurt 
and elsewhere in hesse state said he did not know whether frankfurt

stanford university has agreed to return 
the bones of more than 500 indians to the ohlonecostanoan people 
for reburial 
indians who consider ancestral remains sacred have praised the 
move announced wednesday following followed five years of 
negotiations between the university and the ohlone tribe but some 
anthropologists say it is a blow to medical research 
stanford is giving the indians the right to decide whether to 
take possession of the remains or allow delays for further research 
stanford archaeologist barbara bocek said 
once the indians take charge of the remains she said it would 
be assumed that they would be reburied and gone forever from 
research 
the decision is up to the ohlones she said and if they came 
today for the bones they would be returned 
rayna green a cherokee scholar and author from washington dc 
said she knew of no other formal agreement like the one between 
stanford and the ohlones 
its really extraordinary she said im deeply admiring of 
what stanford is doing 
the decision to support reinterment has been difficult 
provost james rosse wrote to the elders of the ohlones 
in washington the chairman of the anthropology department of the 
smithsonian institution said researchers have made important strides 
recently in analyzing proteins in indian remains that could help 
medical researchers in the study of bone and joint diseases 
from a scientific standpoint its a very bad move donald 
ortner told the washington post there is going to be a terrible 
price to be paid down the road 
bocek said most of the remains involved come from californias 
ryan mound in fremont and the castro mound in mountain view most 
were acquired by stanford scholars as far back as the turn of the 
century

the leader of a group of former federal housing 
officials says there was nothing wrong with using their connections 
to get millions of government dollars for apartment projects they 
were developing 
is it unethical for anybody who has been in government to use 
the expertise they picked up philip winn now the us ambassador 
to switzerland asked following his testimony thursday before a 
congressional panel i dont see anything unethical 
winn who was an assistant secretary of hud for a year before 
making an unsuccessful run for the 1982 gop gubernatorial nomination 
in colorado led a group that won hud funds for several projects in 
the west and southwest in tax credits alone those projects got 
some 29 million from the federal government 
asked if he and his partners used their influence with the agency 
to their advantage winn replied it may very well be the case 
i dont believe my partners willfully disregarded any rules or 
regulations he added 
among winns other partners were silvio debartolomeis former 
general deputy assistant secretary for housing j michael queenan 
the former director of huds denver regional office and lance 
wilson a former executive assistant to thenhud secretary samuel 
pierce jr 
winn was greeted skeptically by members of the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing when he said no 
rules were broken and that competition wasnt squelched 
if it is your purpose to show how that is not the way things 
worked you have a tall order mr ambassador said rep tom 
lantos dcalif the subcommittees chairman 
rep christopher shays rconn also criticized winn youre 
really out of touch 
one of winns partners was philip abrams who had been hud 
undersecretary the secondhighest post in the department 
earlier abrams told the panel that his position at hud which 
he likened to being vice president of the united states rarely 
gave him operational authority and that some of those functions had 
been handled by deborah gore dean who followed wilson as executive 
assistant to pierce 
in testimony before the panel ms dean has been identified time 
and again as the key individual within the department whose support 
was needed to get increasingly scarce government funds to pay 
developers for fixing up and running housing projects for the poor 
and the elderly 
her wideranging but unofficial authority as well as pierces 
detached management of the department have become focal points of 
the investigation into allegations of influence peddling at hud 
when she appeared before the subcommittee a few weeks ago ms 
dean invoked her constitutional right against selfincrimination and 
refused to testify pierces testimony before the panel in may at 
times became a shouting match as the former secretary tried to 
defend his role at the department and members of congress accused 
him of trying to deflect blame 
abrams testified that before leaving hud in 1984 his 
relationship with ms dean was cordial but became strained on 
occasion 
he said it flared up on one occasion when she thought that i 
had sidestepped her 
but he said they became more friendly after he quit the 
department and went into partnership with winn 
on two occasions in 1986 abrams sent handwritten notes to ms 
dean both addressed dear debbie seeking hud funding for 
projects in oklahoma and nevada both projects got the money 
the subcommittee on thursday also heard from joseph strauss a 
former special assistant to pierce who received 13 million in 
consultant fees in connection with 13 moderate rehabilitation 
projects 
after leaving hud to go into private business strauss hired 
former interior secretary james watt on a retainer to help get money 
from the department 
the reason was because of his access and his influence 
strauss said of his decision to retain watt i dont want to make 
any bones about that

more than 60 antiapartheid demonstrators protested 
in london today while prime minister margaret thatcher met with a 
politician who will become south africas next president in 
september 
police said seven demonstrators were arrested at a protest 
outside the south african embassy and one was arrested outside mrs 
thatchers home where she met with fw de klerk leader of south 
africas governing national party 
mrs thatcher said after her meeting that she believed there was 
a new mood in the racially segregated nation 
it was evident that there is a greater determination to 
resolve the great issues of the day through negotiation said a 
statement issued by her office our hope is that these new 
opportunities will be grasped and there will be an end to violence 
a protester splattered white paint on de klerks blue jaguar as 
he arrived at mrs thatchers residence and tried to rush toward the 
car 
police overpowered three protesters who broke from a group of 15 
holding banners near a security barrier about 40 yards from mrs 
thatchers front door 
robert hughes chairman of the antiapartheid movement said mrs 
thatcher should not engage in a process of dialogue with the 
apartheid regime 
outside the south african embassy 50 demonstrators banged drums 
and blew whistles in a daylong protest some banners described de 
klerk and mrs thatcher as fascists 
others said free mandela now referring to black leader 
nelson mandela who has been in prison since 1964 serving a life 
term for sabotage and trying to overthrow the south african 
government mrs thatchers statement said she had pleaded with de 
klerk to release mandela 
the statement also said she reiterated that she will not talk 
with south african groups that practice violence indicating she 
will continue to refuse meetings with representatives of mandelas 
african national congress guerrilla movement 
at a news conference at the south african embassy de klerk made 
no reference to mandela but said he and mrs thatcher agreed about 
the need for continued discussion and interaction between the two 
governments 
de klerk is to replace president pw botha in september 
he called the news conference but then refused to answer 
questions saying he had to get to an appointment with foreign 
secretary sir geoffrey howe 
de klerk said he discussed with mrs thatcher south africas 
position on constitutional development and the negotiation 
process 
he appeared to be referring to the whiteled governments so 
unsuccessful attempts to get black leaders to enter constitutional 
talks 
south africas apartheid system denies the nations 28 million 
blacks a vote in national affairs the white minority of 5 million 
controls the economy and maintains separate neighborhoods schools 
and health services 
mrs thatcher is the wests most outspoken opponent of imposing 
economic sanctions on south africa to pressure it to end apartheid 
she contends such sanctions cost jobs including in britain hurt 
south africas black majority most and harden white resistance to 
change

another foreign youth flying a 
singleengine cessna swooped out of the western sky into soviet 
airspace today but this one was met with children and flowers 
instead of police and a jail cell 
tony aliengena an 11yearold from california arrived in 
leningrad this morning his flight was approved well in advance 
unlike that of mathias rust who spent 14 months in a moscow prison 
after evading soviet air defenses and landing in red square two 
years ago 
tony from san juan capistrano sent a letter to president 
mikhail s gorbachev in may 1988 asking permission to fly across the 
soviet union otherwise closed to foreigners on a friendship 
flight 
thirteen months and 150000 in expenses later he landed in 
leningrad with an entourage including his parents and sister a 
documentary film crew a 10yearold russian pen pal a publicity 
agent soviet and american journalists and a worldrecord observer 
to verify his attempt to become the youngest person to pilot a plane 
around the globe 
after touching down in leningrad under clear skies the 
fourthgrader looked nervous but sounded nonchalant 
what do you have to say to soviet children he was asked by a 
crowd of reporters upon exiting his red white and blue cessna 210 
centurion turboprop 
i say want to say hi the scrubbed crewcut youth said 
with a shrug 
do you want to be an astronaut asked another reporter 
no i want to be a brain surgeon he replied 
tonys soviet host gennady alferenko director of the foundation 
for social invention in moscow was not so relaxed 
alferenko said soviet defense ministry officials were at first 
horrified by tonys flight plan because of the memory of rust a 
19yearold west german whose aerial escapade in a singleengine 
cessna led to the retirement of defense minister sergei l sokolov 
and the firing of the chief of soviet air defenses you mean its 
the same kind of plane alferenko quoted the ministry officials as 
saying 
tony will show all the soviet union what it means the freedom 
to fly alferenko said now a siberian boy will think why do i 
have to stay in this village in siberia i live in the whole world 
and i went to see it to fly by balloon or cross the bering strait 
by kayak 
alferenkos foundation is financing the soviet portion of tonys 
trip 
it is also untangling red tape so tony can make 14 stops in the 
soviet union mostly in isolated siberian towns the soviet route 
will enable him to cross the pacific ocean on a short hop across the 
bering strait to alaska and then head home 
the price for the soviet portion of tonys flight is 70000 
including 10000 for landing rights alone 
tony will fly to moscow on monday where he hopes to present a 
friendship scroll signed by 250000 american children to gorbachev 
tony said he still doesnt know if he will get to meet gorbachev 
tony began his flight june 5 in california

the department of energy has decided to allow 
outside scrutiny of health records of 600000 people who have worked 
on government nuclear projects over the past four decades sen john 
glenn dohio said today 
the decision is a dramatic policy reversal for the agency which 
has been fighting a freedom of information act request for the data 
filed by the three mile island public health fund a group created 
after the accident at the three mile island nuclear power plant in 
pennsylvania 
glenn who for several years has been investigating problems in 
the governments nuclear weapons complex began pressing for the 
release of the data two months ago 
he said he asked for the health records because of the growing 
controversy over the conflicts of interest between the does dual 
roles of promoting radiation technologies and assessing their health 
impacts 
the medical information dates back to the early 1940s when the 
government began work on the manhattan project to develop the atomic 
bomb it includes records of workers at about 50 government 
facilities and is considered the worlds largest body of 
information on the effects of radiation exposure 
energy secretary james d watkins said he ordered the department 
to establish a national repository for all epidemiologically 
relevant information on doe workers that central data base would 
cost 45 million the washington post reported in todays editions 
the department also awarded the national academy of sciences a 
250000 contract to develop a mechanism for giving qualified 
researchers access to the raw files before the central data base 
is ready the newspaper said researchers should be able to start 
reviewing the files in a few months the post said 
energy department spokesmen did not immediately return a 
telephone message seeking comment on the new policy 
in the past the department has refused to release the records on 
the ground it was barred under privacy laws and agreements with 
state health agencies the national academy of sciences job will be 
to find a way to overcome those impediments 
glenn praised watkins in a statement for assuring that these 
studies will no longer be hidden behind the shroud of secrecy 
the doe is taking a first positive step to make this research 
part of the broader public health domain he said

the justice department has a legal obligation 
to supply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial 
court opinions and orders in tax cases the supreme court ruled 
today 
the justices by an 81 vote said the federal freedom of 
information act imposes such a duty on the justice departments tax 
division 
government lawyers warning of enormous administrative costs 
and burdens at taxpayer expense had urged the high court to rule 
that the 1966 law aimed at curtailing government secrecy does not go 
that far 
tax analysts a washingtonbased weekly magazine reporting 
legislative judicial and regulatory development in federal 
taxation first invoked the foia in 1984 in seeking timely copies of 
federal court opinions and orders from the justice department 
such opinions and orders are available to the public from the 
individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them 
quickly 
the justice departments tax division turned down the magazines 
foia request and a federal judge upheld the denial 
but the us circuit court of appeals here last year ruled that 
the government must comply with the foia requests and todays 
decision upheld that ruling 
government lawyers estimate that complying with the tax analysts 
requests on a regular basis will cost nearly 75000 a year for 
search time alone 
they had told the court that commercial publishers and law firms 
would flood the justice department with similar requests if the 
appeals court ruling were not overturned 
but writing for the court today justice thurgood marshall said 
justice department officials improperly withheld agency records 
as defined by the foia 
only justice harry a blackmun dissented saying it seems to 
me that the lnguage of the statute is not that clear or conclusive 
on the issue and more important because the result the court 
reaches cannot be one that was within the intent of congress when 
the foia was enacted 
the case is us justice department vs tax analysts 88782

situation got out of control the officers were trying very hard to 
do the right thing to solve the gang problem to solve the 
narcotics trafficking problem unfortunately while doing the right

resigned and another was fired for an unrelated rules violation 
police officials said 
police seized crack cocaine marijuana and a sawedoff rifle 
during the raid gates said of 32 people taken into custody nine

town 400 miles northeast of kinshasa zaires capital savimbi and 
dos santos sealed the accord with a handshake

a transient with a history of sleeping 
in big trash bins was found dead after he was scooped up by a 
garbage truck crew 
an autopsy performed thursday to determine the cause of death was 
incomplete which means the man could have been dead before he was 
hoisted into the truck said los angeles county coroners spokesman 
bob dambacher 
the mans body was covered with cuts and bruises but didnt 
appear crushed although he had been tossed into the trucks trash 
compactor which can exert more than 17000 pounds of pressure per 
square inch said police lt ellis smith 
the man probably failed to awake when the trash hopper at a 
storefront district on sepulveda boulevard was picked up 
mechanically wednesday morning and upended over the cargo bay of the 
garbage truck 
but culver city sanitation manager mark gauerke conceded the 
possibility that the hydraulic lifts could have drowned out the

a european weather satellite will be moved west 
to gather images of the entire south atlantic ocean and help fill a 
gap left by a failed us satellite the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration announced today 
officials said the european satellite called meteosat 3 will be 
moved to a point at 50 degrees west longitude over the atlantic the 
move is expected to be completed by next october 
gene legg staff meteorologist at noaas satellite service 
center said that from its new location meteosat 3 will be able to 
view weather patterns as far west as colorado and as far east as the 
atlantic coast of africa 
this will be very helpful during the hurricane season legg 
said the european satellite will be able to detect developing 
hurricanes earlier than the us weather satellites he said 
the united states has had two satellites called goes positioned 
to gather weather images of the atlantic and pacific oceans and all 
of this country but last january an imaging instrument failed on 
the goes 6 satellite which was positioned to photograph the pacific 
and the western united states 
to compensate noaa has been making the goes 7 satellite do 
double duty goes 7 was positioned at 108 degrees west longitude in 
the winter and then moved to 98 degrees west in the spring to 
monitor the atlantic hurricane season 
with the assistance of the european satellite legg said it will 
not be necessary to seasonally move goes 7 this should prolong the 
lifetime of that satellite he said since it uses less fuel while 
stationary 
the united states plans to launch a new goes satellite in july 
1990 
legg said data from the european meteosat 3 will be beamed to 
stations in europe for processing and then retransmitted to weather 
agencies on both sides of the atlantic he said this relay will 
delay images about half an hour compared with the time required to 
receive pictures from goes 7 
images from the european satellite also will look slightly 
different than those from goes 7 legg said that since meteosat 3 
will be over a more easterly point than was goes 7 the images as 
seen on television screens will show less of the united states 
the coast of florida for instance will be farther to the left 
of the projected image than it is in views taken by goes 7 
by moving the meteosat 3 west the europeans return a favor to 
the us weather service from 1985 to 1988 noaa repositioned the 
goes 4 satellite over the eastern atlantic in order to fill a gap in 
weather monitoring created when an earlier meteosat failed

we do not allow weapons in my home and i certainly did not 
want my children to see them he said

two daughters 4yearold susannah and 2yearold rosalind in an 
apartment house overlooking the camp on the outskirts of ramallah 
he told the the associated press that during his detention he 
tried to make sure palestinians held by the soldiers at the camp 
were well treated 
he complained however that if anyone talked they were 
shouted at or kicked 
george said that when he saw a soldier kick a palestinian in the 
side he told the soldier that isnt necessary and was told 
shut up

oman in the 1970s

israeli shells and bombs devastated the camp in the 1982 war 
foreigners left the lebanon office of save the children after a 
series of kidnappings by shiite moslem radicals made the country 
unsafe for westerners when the israeli army last month began

the president today asked interim premier 
andreas papandreou who is hospitalized with pneumonia to try to 
form a new government after conservative leader constantine 
mitsotakis failed to do so 
there was no immediate comment from papandreou who was admitted 
to general state hospital on thursday he has until monday to come 
up with a government 
a medical bulletin today said the 70yearold papandreou who led 
greece eight years until his party lost sundays election was 
receiving the proper medical treatment and will remain in the 
hospital papandreou underwent a triple heart bypass operation in 
london eight months ago 
mitsotakis told president christos sartzetakis today he was 
unable to form a government in the threeday constitutional limit 
he blamed the failure on the coalition of left and progress an 
alliance of the communist and greek left parties 
sundays national elections ended without a majority in 
parliament forcing the country to seek its first coalition 
government since the return to democracy in 1974 
under the constitution the president offers the leading party 
mitsotakis centerright new democracy the first chance to form a 
government papandreous panhellenic socialist movement or pasok 
which finished second in the election gets the second chance 
followed by the coalition which finished third 
new democracy made specific proposals to the greek political 
world and especially to the left the proposals i made were honest 
and went beyond the demands of the left mitsotakis said at a news 
conference after his meeting with the president 
the conservative leader had appealed to the coalition to join an 
interim government with a mandate limited to rooting out allegations 
of corruption and scandal in papandreous government

call new elections after carrying out the catharsis or 
cleansing of greeces government

new democracy won 145 parliamentary seats in the vote seven 
short of the number needed for a majority in the 300seat 
parliament pasok won 125 seats and the coalition 28

being shamed internationaly following revelations of a new 
banking scandal

mortgage bank who allegedly laundered about 700 million though its 
american braches

the supreme court today refused to let congress 
totally outlaw the billiondollar dialaporn industry 
rejecting arguments that such a ban is needed to protect the 
nations children from merely indecent messages 
the justices unanimously said congress was not justified when it 
passed a law last year banning all sexually explicit telephone 
dialup message services 
congress may outlaw obscene telephone messages only not indecent 
ones the court said the dialaporn industry therefore must be 
allowed to survive it said 
the ban violates freespeech rights when applied to indecent 
messages the court ruled 
an adult magazines graphic centerfold or a movie love scene that 
leaves nothing to the imagination may or may not be obscene 
thats for a jury to decide if such material is deemed only 
indecent it is constitutionally protected 
in other action the court 
ruled that states are not required by the constitution to 
provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial round 
of appeals 
by a 54 vote the court ruled in favor of virginia officials who 
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in secondround appeals 
could lead to interminable delays in carrying out executions 
made it more difficult for older workers to prove that when 
some of their benefits are reduced their employers violated a 
federal law against age discrimination 
by a 72 vote the court revived an ohio pension law provision 
challenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability 
ruled that the justice department has a legal obligation to 
supply a weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court 
opinions and orders in tax cases 
the justices by an 81 vote said the federal freedom of 
information act imposes such a duty on the justice departments tax 
division 
a 1988 law made it a crime to use a telephone to make any 
obscene or indecent communication for commercial purposes but 
its total ban was never imposed because us district judge a 
wallace tashima in los angeles ruled it could be applied only to 
obscene not merely indecent phone messages 
the judge said that outlawing nonobscene messages even though 
they may be inappropriate for minors violates the freespeech 
protections of the constitutions first amendment 
today the nations highest court said the law could be applied 
to obscene messages but not to indecent ones 
sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is 
protected by the constitutions first amendment justice byron 
r white wrote for the court 
in an argument session before the justices last april the bush 
administration urged that the total ban be reinstated 
justice department lawyer richard taranto said then that the ban 
is needed to protect children from hearing patently offensive 
speech 
but laurance tribe a harvard law professor representing a 
dialaporn company said technological safeguards blocking 
childrens access to the racy messages make a total ban unnecessary 
and unconstitutional 
in todays decision white said it may well be that there is 
no failsafe method of guaranteeing that never will a minor be able 
to access the dialaporn system 
but he said technological restrictions on the industry might 
prove extremely effective and only a few of the most enterprising 
and disobedient young people will manage to secure access to such 
messages 
the courts three most liberal justices in freedomofexpression 
cases william j brennan thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
voted to strike down the law as it applies to obscene material as 
well 
i have long been convinced that the exaction of criminal 
penalties for the distribution of obscene materials to consenting 
adults is constitutionally intolerable brennan wrote in an 
opinion joined by marshall and stevens 
dialaporn companies make their services available to callers 
through 976 exchanges and atampts 900 longdistance lines 
the telephone company typically charges callers according to 
percall rates retaining a portion of the charges and giving the 
remainder to the dialaporn company 
the same exchanges also are used for other noncontroversial 
types of messages such as sports scores time checks and weather 
reports 
born in 1983 the dialaporn industry matured quickly according 
to court records in 1984 some 180 million calls were placed by 
customers in new york alone 
the industrys income last year topped 2 billion 
congress in 1983 directed the federal communications commission 
to figure out ways children could be prevented from calling 
dialaporn services a companys failure to adhere to those methods 
was to be a crime 
the commission considered various means of restricting access to 
sexually explicit messages and eventually settled on access codes 
scramblers and requiring credit card payment 
but an impatient congress in 1988 enacted the outright ban 
writing for the court white said because the statutes denial 
of adult access to telephone messages which are indecent but not 
obscene far exceeds that which is necessary to limit the access of 
minors to such messages we hold that the ban does not survive 
constitutional scrutiny 
obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually 
explicit material 
the supreme court since 1973 had defined obscenity as a work that 
appeals to a morbid interest in sex is patently offensive and when 
taken as a whole lacks serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value 
sexually explicit material often called pornography may or may 
not be legally obscene 
in 1978 the court drew a distinction between obscene and 
indecent expression when it allowed federal regulators to 
restrict the broadcast of indecent language 
upholding the governments power to punish use of dirty words 
carried on television or radio at times when children might be 
listening the court adopted the fccs definition of indecent 
patently offensive references to excretory and sexual organs or 
activities 
after tashimas decision last july the reagan administration 
appealed directly to the supreme court challenging that part of the 
ruling that protects indecent material 
sable communications of california inc a major purveyor of 
dialaporn services in that state filed a counterappeal 
challenging the part of tashimas ruling that allows the ban on 
materials judged to be obscene 
the cases are sable communications v fcc 88515 and fcc vs 
sable communications 88525

the supreme court today made it more difficult 
for older workers to prove that when some of their benefits are 
reduced their employers violated a federal law against age 
discrimination 
by a 72 vote the court revived an ohio pension law provision 
challenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said to win 
her case the woman must prove that the reduced benefits resulted 
from an intent to discriminate in some nonfringe benefit aspect 
of the employment relation 
the ruling apparently means that workers charging age bias in 
such cases must prove reduced fringe benefits were aimed for 
example at discouraging older workers from applying for jobs or 
were intended to force them to quit 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said the 
ruling immunizes virtually all employee benefit programs from 
liability under the federal age discrimination in employment act 
of 1967 
he said henceforth liability will not attach under the adea 
even if an employer is unable to put forth any jusitification for 
denying older workers the benefits younger ones receive and indeed 
even if his only reason for discriminating against older workers in 
benefits is his abject hostility to or his unfounded stereotypes of 
them 
justice william j brennan joined marshalls dissent 
the case stems from a challenge to an ohio law by june betts a 
former speech pathologist for the hamilton county mental retardation 
department 
when her work degenerated because of medical problems ms betts 
was given a choice by the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical 
leave or retirement with a standard pension 
she was barred from receiving more generous disability retirement 
benefits because she was 61 
a provision of the state pension plan allowed disability benefits 
only for those who worked for the state for at least five years and 
were under 60 when forced to quit 
ms betts pension was 15850 a month under the standard plan 
compared to 355 a month in disability retirement benefits 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld a federal 
judges ruling in ms betts favor that threw out the states 
agebased pension provision 
the appeals court said the provision violated the federal age 
discrimination in employment act since ohio officials failed to 
prove that giving larger benefits to younger workers is justified by 
cost considerations 
todays supreme court ruling said the state was not required to 
prove that for the benefit plan to survive 
the case is public employees retirement system of ohio vs betts

states are immune from being sued for monetary 
damages by bankrupt businesses and individuals the supreme court 
ruled today 
by a 54 vote in a connecticut case the court said federal 
bankruptcy law may not be used to pierce the legal armor the 
constitution gives states 
in a separate bankruptcy ruling the court voted 63 that 
defendants charged by a bankruptcy trustee with fraud are entitled 
to jury trials 
the decision in the connecticut case was a defeat for martin w 
hoffman a courtappointed trustee supervising payment to creditors 
of the wilington convalescent home and edward zera who ran a 
maintenance service 
the nursing home which shut its doors in 1983 said connecticut 
owed it 64000 in medicaid payments for patients it treated 
congress did not abograte 11th amendment immunity by enacting 
federal bankruptcy law justice byron r white wrote in the 
courts main opinion 
justices thurgood marshall william j brennan harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens dissented 
in the second case the court threw out a 16 million judgment 
against two colombian banking corporations won by a bankruptcy 
trustee for the chase amp sanborn corp 
in an opinion by brennan the court said granfianciera and medex 
wrongly were deprived of a jury trial when facing allegations that 
three money transfers from chase amp sanborn to them were fraudulent 
and could be avoided by the bankruptcy trustee 
chase amp sanborn filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law 
in miami in 1983 
two years later bankruptcy trustee paul c nordberg filed a 
complaint against the two colombian corporations 
a bankruptcy judge awarded the trustee 15 million from 
granfianciera and 180000 against medex 
but brennans opinion said the award cannot stand because the 
constitutions 7th amendment guarantees such defendants a jury trial 
if they request it 
justices white blackmun and sandra day oconnor dissented 
the cases are hoffman vs connecticut department of income 
maintenance 88412 and granfinanciera vs nordberg 871716

a dog named master teddy who inherited his 
owners 102000 house and fought off her relatives in a courtroom 
wrangle won another legal round today this time to save his hide 
from the tattooists needle 
when celeste v crawford died in 1984 her will said teddy could 
live in her silver spring home for the rest of his life with a 
friend of hers allowed to live there to look after the dog 
her relatives went to court because they didnt want to wait for 
the dogs death but three years ago a judge ruled they cannot 
inherit and divvy up proceeds from the houses sale until teddy dies 
fearing another white spitz could be substituted for teddy the 
six heirs next sought to have a montgomery county circuit judge in 
rockville order a veterinarian to tattoo teddys hind leg 
the heirs said the tattoo would positively identify the dogs 
body and serve as a safeguard against possible dognapping 
today just as a hearing on their new dispute was to begin 
lawyers for both sides reached an outofcourt settlement that would 
enable the dog to be identified after its death without a tattoo 
karl g feissner an attorney for the dogs caretaker said 
teddys veterinarian had xrays and photographs that could properly 
identify the dog and the agreement would allow a detailed 
inspection of the dogs corpse to satisfy all parties 
everybodys going to look at this dog everybody in the 
world feissner said earlier he had suggested that if the judge 
had approved the tattooing the heirs should be tattooed too so we 
know whos who 
ralph gordon who represents the heirs including mrs crawfords 
siblings had refused to disclose any information about the legal 
action we are not going to be the genesis of any publicity on 
this case he said 
chester a anderson a veterinarian said in an affidavit that 
tattooing was a quick painless and permanent method for 
identifying a dog 
but kt somaiah teddys veterinarian for the past decade 
argued in court papers against tattooing the 13yearold dog 
it is not a wise idea to have teddy tattooed at his age since 
it is very traumatic and has to be done under general anesthesia and 
hence is not conducive to his health somaiah said in my 
professional opinion teddy still has a few more years of good 
life 
the 60pound dog had been a constant companion to mrs crawford 
until she died of cancer at 77 
in her will she also said that her friend george j schnabele 
whos rented the basement apartment since 1968 should be allowed to 
live at the house and care for teddy until the dogs eath when 
teddy dies schnabele a 74yearold retired policeman would have 
to leave so the house could be sold 
schnabele who takes the dog to the park daily for exercise said 
he had no idea why the relatives were seeking the tattoo 
if mrs crawford were alive shed have a fit schnabele said

a us relief worker 
kidnapped in the gaza strip was freed today and said his captors 
gave him a letter urging greater understanding of the palestinian 
situation especially among americans 
chris george codirector of the usheadquartered save the 
children federation told reporters he was treated well during his 
30hour captivity 
they were nice to me said george 35 of montclair nj i 
practiced my arabic during this period 
george who was kidnapped thursday in gaza city showed reporters 
a sixpage letter he said the kidnappers asked him to deliver to 
president bush the letter requested that bush meet with plo leader 
yasser arafat 
the letter also said the kidnapping was not intended to hurt 
americans but was a plea for people across the world especially the 
united states to understand the plight of the palestinians and 
their need for independence 
george was released at the un hostel on the beach in gaza city 
then taken to the marne house hotel by about 10 americans from the

terrorists linked to the plo palestinian accounts said the hostage 
sent letters demanding jailed palestinian prisoners be set free

said foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
state department sources in washington said george was released 
into the custody of the red crescent the arab red cross the 
officials who demanded anonymity said it was not known who 
kidnapped george 
during the 18month uprising against israeli occupation the 
plobacked underground in the occupied lands has maintained a policy 
opposing the use of arms and exempting foreigners from attacks the 
kidnapping would mark a change of strategy if it was sanctioned by 
the leadership more than 500 palestinians and 23 isrealis have been 
killed in the uprising 
after the abduction the army set up checkpoints and stopped cars 
driven by palestinians in gaza city a city of 150000 soldiers

they can discuss an important subject abu shaaban said chris 
never came back

enough to hug and kiss him 
a palestinian journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
a red cross worker showed him one of two letters written in english 
by george 
after 20 hours i write my second letter to the american 
ambassador and george bush and his administration the friends of 
the israeli government in order to obtain my freedom he quoted 
the letter as saying 
the letter received by save the children today said george was 
abducted by five men armed with a machine gun and four grenades

palestinian activists held in israeli jails including sheikh ahmed 
yassin the wheelchairbound spiritual leader of the hamas 
fundamentalist movement which does not belong to the plo mutawakil 
taha a member of yasser arafats fatah organization and the head of 
the arab writers union who is held without trial unde 
administrative detention and members of two plo factions the 
syrianbased popular front for the liberation of palestine and 
procommunist democratic front for the liberation of palestine

orders for bigticket factory goods in may 
plunged at the steepest rate in 10 months the government said 
friday raising the prospect of layoffs at manufacturing plants 
in a second report indicating the economy is running out of 
steam the commerce department said americans income grew at the 
slowest pace since september 
orders for durable goods items ranging from toasters to tanks 
fell 42 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1240 
billion the department reported that was the largest decline since 
july 1988 
economists monitor the orders as a measure of the industrial 
sectors health and to gauge the impact of interest rates on the 
economy persistent weakness is liable to lead to layoffs at 
manufacturing plants 
it means fewer people will be needed to make things whether 
its planes or cars or washing machines said economist cynthia 
latta of data resources inc in lexington mass 
in the other report the government said americans personal 
income and personal spending both rose a lackluster 03 percent last 
month not even keeping up with inflation 
it was the weakest income number since september and worst 
spending figure since october 
durablegoods orders have fallen in three of the last five months 
and their level remains 59 billion below the december high of 
1321 billion 
at the same time that business is dropping off manufacturers are 
being squeezed by higher energy and labor costs said economist 
allen sinai of the boston co 
are we going to have layoffs yes a big round of layoffs i 
would doubt it not soon anyway but by 1990 i wouldnt be 
suprised he said 
the unemployment rate in part reflecting weakness in 
manufacturing has risen to 52 percent last month up from a 
15year low of 5 percent in march 
however william c dunkelberg dean of temple universitys 
business school pointed out that the backlog of unfilled orders 
remains high at 4676 billion up 01 percent from april that 
will keep factory workers busy enough to cushion the effect of 
lagging orders 
i dont think its anything too scary at this point he said 
if orders were to continue to deteriorate at this pace obviously 
wed eat up that backlog pretty fast but i dont think they will 
fridays economic reports are consistent with other recent 
evidence that the economy is slowing in response to a yearlong 
campaign by the federal reserve board to fight inflation with higher 
interest rates 
durable goods are particularly sensitive to interest rates 
because consumers must usually borrow to buy them recently the fed 
has eased monetary policy slightly in response to signs of 
sluggishness 
michael k evans a private economic consultant in washington 
said the central bank likely will be cautious about loosening 
further but he said if we get another month of numbers like 
these the fed is going to ease 
analysts were less alarmed by the may report than they might have 
been because orders had surged 32 percent in april and because may 
was heavily influenced by a sharp decline in orders for aircraft and 
parts 
excluding the volatile transportation sector which swings widely 
from month to month orders fell a more moderate 21 percent in may 
after rising 45 percent in april excluding military purchasing 
which is also volatile orders declined 39 percent in may after a 
51 percent rise a month earlier 
nevertheless orders were down across all sectors last month 
transportation fell 94 percent primary metals including steel 
dropped 15 percent electrical machinery was down 45 percent and 
nonelectrical machinery fell 34 percent orders for military goods 
dropped 86 percent in may after a 182 percent plunge in april 
orders for nondefense capital goods considered a good barometer 
of business plans to expand and modernize fell 83 percent in may 
after rising 58 percent a month earlier it was the biggest decline 
since september 
shipments of durable goods also fell last month edging down 01 
percent to 1233 billion shipments had risen 24 percent in april

theyre burning donald duck mickey 
mouse and bambi in bangkok and walt disney executives couldnt be 
happier 
torching toys tshirts and books emblazoned with the famous 
cartoon characters is part of an offensive by disney against rife 
counterfeiting of its products across asia 
the american entertainment giant is enjoying a boom on the 
continent but also loses between 10 million and 20 million each 
year in royalties because of the pirates according to john j 
feenie who heads disneys consumer products division in asia this 
estimate does not include losses to pirates of disney videotapes 
short of erecting their own disneyland adroit craftsmen fake 
virtually all the companys merchandise fluffy mickey mouse dolls 
videotapes of cartoon classics childrens clothing books pens 
stationery figurines and watches 
while many foreign companies are reluctant to become involved in 
the legal wrangles and costs of tackling asias teeming pirates 
feenie said disney decided to take action after its fortunes surged 
in asia about two years ago and local licensees began to complain 
about ripoffs 
thailand was picked as the first target the country affords 
copyright protection by law but has become a haven for pirates 
because of lax enforcement low penalties cheap labor costs and a 
vigorous entrepreneurial spirit copies of the worlds leading brand 
name products can be found on bangkoks streets 
feenie said thailand was also singled out because it is a big 
exporter of disney fakes to the middle east and perhaps most 
importantly is seen as major future market for and a legitimate 
manufacturer of the companys consumer line 
disney already has licensed six companies in the country 
including srithai superware co ltd which feenie described as a 
model for us because it is following the rules and still making 
hefty profits srithai produces childrens dinnerware sets and 
utensils for disneyland and disneyworld in the united states 
tokyos disneyland and other foreign outlets 
were not just going to be the big foreigner clubbing the 
little guy feenie said in an interview we want to help develop 
local business and it will be the locals who will fight for us 
because they will see their own interests hurt by the pirates 
following complaints from the thai licensees disney hired an 
outfit in the anticounterfeiting field to run a threemonth survey 
of the market 
a pile of cases accumulated he said and with police 
cooperation raids were staged beginning in march against the most 
flagrant violators typically these were sweatshoptype operators 
with their own retail outlets 
confiscated merchandise worth about 30000 has been burned in 
big piles at a city dump disney executives hope the bonfires will 
deter the fakers 
well continue with the program there will be no letup until 
there is a significant drop in the level of counterfeiting feenie 
said were hoping other companies will join us more hands make 
lighter work 
the disney vice president said similar campaigns to protect 
copyrights and trademarks will be launched in taiwan south korea 
and malaysia while a second phase will focus on the philippines 
and indonesia china despite its avalanche of counterfeits is 
not a current priority because of recent political turmoil 
the massive fakery reflects disneys mass appeal among asians 
everyone loves disney characters says feenie the retail value 
of disneys consumer products excluding videotapes in asia is 
estimated at more than 1 billion and further growth is projected 
legitimate disney business in taiwan has doubled in the last two 
years the mickey and donald show a potpourri of old cartoons 
dubbed in mandarin is seen by 250 million chinese each week making 
it the no 1 tv show in the world in terms of viewership feenie 
said 
in japan which is virtually counterfeitfree disney is notching 
doubledigit growth and considering another theme park along the 
lines of tokyos disneyland which opened in 1983 and has been a 
money spinner since 
the company feenie said is even thinking about markets such as 
vietnam and the indian subcontinent where mickey mouse and his crew 
enduringly lovable and profitable have yet to make an inroad

jewish holocaust survivors who adjusted best to 
life after world war ii were able to seal away their traumas so 
successfully that they protect even their presentday dreams 
according to an israeli study 
the findings suggest that modern techniques of treating 
posttraumatic stress syndrome such as that suffered by vietnam war 
veterans may actually be aggravating the disorder instead of curing 
it said peretz lavie a psychology professor at technionisrael 
institute of technology in haifa where the study was conducted 
in a paper prepared for presentation today at the annual meeting 
of the association of professional sleep societies lavie said a 
study of a group of survivors of the holocaust found those who were 
the most healthy mentally had learned to suppress recall of 
virtually all dreams 
this he said was a defense mechanism against the awful memories 
of the nazi persecution of jews during world war ii 
these survivors also spent little time while awake thinking about 
the wartime trauma and showed little interest in reviewing their 
experiences yet when prompted they could recall those days in 
detail 
these data suggest it is better to suppress some types of 
trauma lavie said in an interview thursday its better to 
forget it than to year after year expose them to the trauma through 
therapy 
one washington psychiatrist defending the current conventional 
treatment suggested that lavie needed to prove his theory by 
testing the alternative theories with matched sets of holocaust 
survivors 
in the study lavie and an associate hanna kaminer used 23 
holocaust survivors to investigate the longterm effects of mental 
trauma by recording the dreams recalled when awakened in the midst 
of deep sleep 
the group included 11 survivors who were determined by tests to 
have adjusted very well to life after the war the other 12 
continued to suffer the effects of the holocaust with emotional and 
mental problems and general dissatisfaction with life 
for four consecutive nights each of the subjects slept in a 
laboratory while their body processes such as heart beat 
respiration and brain activity were monitored 
when slumber reached a point called rapid eye movement or rem 
sleep they were awakened and asked to recount their dreams 
previous studies have shown that most people awakened during rem 
sleep can recall dreams about 80 percent of the time 
the welladjusted had only 30 percent dream recall said 
lavie when we woke them up they denied dreaming they were 
disappointed that they couldnt remember any dreams because they 
truly wanted to help our study 
this group he said also had no sleep disturbances 
whatsoever enjoying peaceful and untroubled sleep before and 
after the awakenings 
the poorly adjusted holocaust survivors however had a 60 
percent dream recall and showed all the signs of posttraumatic 
stress disorders in their sleeping pattern said lavie 
there were multiple arousals they suffered from difficulty in 
falling asleep and there were body movements he said but they 
remembered twice the dreams than the welladjusted did 
lavie said the few dreams recalled by the welladjusted were 
short simple and devoid of emotions 
the dreams of the poorlyadjusted included anxiety regression 
inwardly directed it was mostly all anxiety he said 
based on further tests lavie said it became evident the 
welladjusted survivors had coped with their holocaust experience by 
avoiding the memory 
they sealed it off and this enabled them to go on with their 
life said lavie this was the mechanism that allowed them to 
survive and adapt and adjust 
the mechanism even included what the study called massive dream 
repression that protected against any unconscious recall of the 
distressing memories 
lavie said the study suggests that similar sealing off should 
be taught to vietnam and other war veterans who continue to suffer 
emotional traumas from their experiences 
currently he said the practice is to treat such stress 
disorders by forcing the patients to recall the trauma and to relive 
the emotions the idea is rather like lancing and draining a wound 
but lavie said it may be better to seal the wound with mental 
scar tissue and instead to teach the ptsd patient to forget 
we say that in some cases repression is the key to cure 
said lavie we should stop all of the nonsense of going back over 
and over the trauma and just treat them in the hereandnow and 
divert their attention from the experience 
lavie said his group is now conducting research using the 
suppression technique on veterans of the israeli wars and hopes to 
confirm this new method of treating ptsd 
dr stephen m sonnenberg a washington psychiatrist and author 
of the book the trauma of war stress and recovery in viet nam 
veterans said he has not seen details of the sleep study nor 
talked with lavie 
but he said the theory of treating poorly adapted trauma 
survivors by causing them to forget experiences runs counter to 
current conventional wisdom among those who provide psychotherapy 
for survivors 
most of us feel that the essence of treatment is in assisting 
the survivor in thinking about the traumatic experience and 
mastering it said sonnenberg in a telephone interview 
he said that to test the lavies theory there should be matched 
groups of survivors treated in different ways with one group 
encouraged to remember their traumatic experiences and the other 
encouraged to forget 
only then would dr lavies hypothesis be reasonably tested 
said sonnenberg

the cost of polishmade liquor went up an 
average 50 percent friday in the latest of a series of steep price 
increases imposed as part of an economic reform program 
a half liter of vodka now costs nearly 4 percent of an average 
monthly salary 
the increase announced overnight to prevent hoarding also is 
designed to combat alcoholism under a law requiring liquor prices to 
rise faster than incomes the staterun pap news agency said 
the price of a half liter of the most popular vodka will rise 
from about 299 to about 478 
the average salary for may was about 124 per month with the 
average old age disability or veterans pension put at about 52 
monthly 
most varieties of liquor including those that are imported must 
be purchased for hard currency at special stores 
earlier this week prices for sugar refrigerators and washing 
machines were raised as the government works to get prices closer to 
the statesubsidized cost of production without setting off the 
social unrest and strikes that have often followed increases 
the price rises come at a sensitive time following the freest 
elections in polands communist history during which candidates from 
the solidarityled opposition won a big share of the national 
assembly 
legal again after a sevenyear ban and now a partner with the 
government in polands political and economic life solidarity may 
risk being assigned a degree of responsibility for the increases 
the union and government have agreed that salaries will be raised 
automatically to cover 80 percent of average price increases but 
there is a lag of several months between the time new prices take 
effect and workers receive the raises 
the cost of the standard model refrigerator was raised from about 
84 to 142 pap said the prices of washing machines were raised 37 
percent 
despite the high cost neither appliance is readily available in 
stores 
the price of sugar was raised from 25 cents to 41 cents for 22 
pounds with the government reporting that demand was exceeding 
supply 
the annual inflation rate in poland is officially projected at 
about 60 percent annually but already this year is running at a rate 
of more than 100 percent

irancontra prosecutors moved friday to dismiss 
some charges and narrow the scope of others against former national 
security adviser john m poindexter to eliminate obstacles posed by 
using government secrets in a trial 
in a motion filed a week after he announced plans to abandon the 
charges independent counsel lawrence e walsh asked for dismissial 
of wire fraud and theft of government property charges stemming from 
the diversion of usiran arms sales to finance the nicaraguan 
rebels 
walsh also asked us district judge harold greene to narrow the 
scope of conspiracy charge against poindexter to eliminate all 
references to the armssale diversion and clandestine efforts to 
help the contras 
poindexter would still be charged with conspiring to obstruct 
congressional inquiries into the irancontra affair two counts of 
obstruction and two counts of making false statements to 
congressional investigators in 1986 
experience in the recentlycompleted trial of oliver north has 
made clear that certain broadreaching allegations concerning 
defendants interaction with intelligence agencies and 
highlyclassified covert programs create the potential for 
difficult problems in dealing with classified information the 
motion said 
prosecutors dropped the major irancontra conspiracy charges 
against north because intelligence agencies refused to allow public 
disclosure of government secrets the trial judge had ruled were 
needed by the defense 
walsh said his decision to seek dismissal of the charges against 
poindexter was based discussions with intelligence agencies about 
the former national security advisers request for secret documents 
although it might be possible to resolve those problems through 
limitations on the scope of discovery and proceedings udner cipa 
classified information procedures act independent counsel 
believes that the cost of such efforts in terms of both delay and 
consumption of resources of the court and the parties would be 
excessive walsh said 
no date has been set for poindexters trial 
north a former national security council aide is awaiting 
sentencing on three felony convictions arising from his involvement 
in the irancontra affair

passed a law last year banning all sexually explicit telephone 
dialup message services 
congress may outlaw obscene telephone messages only not indecent

age bias 
 
the court made it more difficult for older workers to prove that 
when some of their benefits are reduced their employers violated a 
federal law against age discrimination

challenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability 
the case is public employees retirement system of ohio vs betts

chief 
emil kimmel a spokesman for the central committee told 
hungarian radio the meeting of the policysetting body would 
continue saturday because so many people had asked to speak in the 
debate 
another issue before the committee was the agenda for a party 
congress meeting this fall the congress is to approve radical 
changes in party policies to boost the communists chances in 
multiparty elections to be held by next summer 
party members who back sweeping reforms have called for the 
committee to replace party chief karoly grosz with a leading 
reformer the most popular reformers include politburo member rezsoe 
nyers minister of state imre pozsgay and foreign minister gyula 
horn 
grosz considered a centrist took over as party general 
secretary from janos kadar in may 1988 but he has lost support as

intesified 
reformers have increasingly argued that only a popular figure

agostinho neto the movements leader immediately requested 
cubas help to fight off jonas savimbis south africanbacked 
national union for the total independence of angola and the 
national liberation front of angola 
the latter eventually disbanded while fighters of the 
charismatic savimbi retreated and established bush headquarters in 
the thinly populated southeastern corner of angola 
from there they staged hitandrun guerrilla raids throughout 
the huge country and fought semiconventional battles against cuban 
and government troops attacking their southeastern strongholds 
savimbis army has controlled most of southeastern angola for 
years administering schools and hospitals in rural areas occupied 
by 2 million to 3 million of the countrys 9 million inhabitants 
the united states has supplied them with stinger groundtoair 
missiles and other sophisticated weapons while south african troops 
have invaded angola to help the rebels 
in one of its largest incursions south africa sent 15000 troops 
more than 60 miles into angola in 1981 
thousands of south african soldiers based in namibia fought in 
southern angola in 1985 and returned in 1988 to take part in a major 
battle for southeastern cuito cuanavale 
in may 1988 both the cubanangolan forces and the rebels and 
south africans claimed they had won control of the city in the 
heaviest fighting of the war 
both sides seemed ready for even larger battles cuban troop 
strength had surpassed 50000 and south africa acknowledged it had 
3000 soldiers more or less based in angola 
faced with an openended conflict and mounting white casualties 
south africa opted for peace talks which began with angola and cuba 
in may 1988 
south africa completed withdrawing from angola last august in 
december the three countries signed an accord calling for south 
africa to halt aid to savimbi and grant independence to namibia 
while cuba withdraws its troops 
the rebels meanwhile vowed to fight on for a share in 
government there have been regular reports of battles this year 
and last month the rebels accused government forces of using 
chemical warfare 
as recently as monday angolan foreign minister afonso van dunem 
said his government would not negotiate with the rebels

stanford university has agreed to return 
ancestral bones to ohlonecostanoans indians but an archaeologist 
said thursday no one has claimed the bones yet and scholars may ask 
for time for more research 
indians have praised the move to return for reburial the skeletal 
remains they consider sacred but some anthropologists say it is a 
blow to medical research 
the announcement wednesday followed five years of negotiations 
between stanford and the ohlone tribe 
stanford archaeologist barbara bocek explained thursday that 
stanford is giving the indians the right to decide whether to 
take possession of the more than 500 bones or allow delays for 
further investigation 
once the indians take charge of the remains bocek said it would 
be assumed that they would be reburied and gone forever from 
research 
the decision is up to the ohlones and if they came today for 
the bones they would be returned bocek said 
but they dont have a hole big enough for the bones they dont 
have a place to put them and they havent asked for them she said 
stanfords decision which could convince other universities to 
do the same was characterized as an extremely difficult one for the 
academics to make praise from the indians was immediate 
rayna green a cherokee scholar and author from washington dc 
said she knew of no other formal agreement like the one between 
stanford and the ohlones 
its really extraordinary she said im deeply admiring of 
what stanford is doing 
the decision to support reinterment has been difficult 
provost james rosse wrote to the elders of ohlones who like other 
native peoples regard ancestral remains as sacred 
in washington the chairman of the anthropology department of the 
smithsonian institution said researchers have made important strides 
recently in analyzing proteins in indian remains that could help 
medical researchers in the study of bone and joint diseases 
from a scientific standpoint its a very bad move donald 
ortner told the washington post there is going to be a terrible 
price to be paid down the road 
bocek said most of the remains involved come from californias 
ryan mound in fremont and the castro mound in mountain view most 
of the remains were acquired by stanford scholars as far back as the 
turn of the century 
indians feel an extremely great sense of continuity with their 
ancestors over generations she said the tradition of respect 
and responsibility for their elders including those who died long 
ago is still a very vital part of the culture 
rosemary cambra a representative of the ohlones said she was 
very very happy stanford has agreed to respect the religious 
rights of the indians 
larry myers executive secretary of the native american heritage 
commission in sacramento said the decision was crucial 
this decision actually puts stanford several steps ahead of 
where the nation appears to be going he said advising that there 
should be limits placed by the university on the research time for 
analysis of remains

a rodeo group must compensate a woman injured 
when an enraged bull jumped three fences and charged into the 
bathroom where she was waiting out the competition a judge ruled 
the indoor rodeo arenas 5foot restraining fences should have 
been higher to contain the bull even though he performed a 
routine that even an olympic steeplechase horse would have trouble 
duplicating said district judge jon kerian 
the bull after throwing its rider and chasing a rodeo clown out 
of the ring went over the fences and down a hall before bursting 
into the bathroom according to testimony 
the animal pinned barbara deck against a wall injuring her left 
shoulder and arm and kicked out a bathroom sink before the woman 
was rescued by cowboys said her attorney david hogue 
mrs deck was waiting while her husband watched the bull riding 
because she once saw a bull break the legs of its rider hogue said 
the north dakota rodeo association must pay mrs deck 15000 
plus more than 3000 in medical expenses for the july 1985 
incident kerian ruled wednesday after a oneday trial kerian also 
awarded daniel deck 3000 for the loss of his wifes services in 
farm chores 
the rodeo associations attorney lawrence dopson said an appeal 
was unlikely

chicagos steppenwolf theater company received 
mostly warm reviews from london critics friday following the 
european debut of its stage version of john steinbecks the grapes 
of wrath 
jack tinker in the daily mail called the play adapted from 
steinbecks depressionera pulitzer prizewinning novel as 
shatteringly a perfect piece of american theater as you are likely 
to experience in a lifetime of transatlantic travel 
claire armitstead in the financial times found the show a 
magnificent ensemble piece richly and simply evocative 
london is the third stop for the play which bowed in chicago 
last september before moving last month to the la jolla playhouse 
in california the hope is for it to go to broadway in the upcoming 
season if financing can be found for a new york production with a 
cast of 35 
the 12performance london engagement at the nationals midsized 
lyttelton auditorium was 70 percent sold before it opened it is 
expected to sell out the remainder of the run through july 1 on 
the strength of the reviews 
it is the second steppenwolf show to be seen in london following 
the 1986 run of lyle kesslers orphans with british actor 
albert finney 
the threehour play is more faithful to the book than was john 
fords 1940 movie starring henry fonda and jane darwell as tom and 
ma joad who lead a community of itinerants westward across the dust 
bowl to california 
adapted and directed by frank galati an oscar nominee this year 
for cowriting the accidental tourist the play stars gary 
sinise as tom and lois smith as his mother 
jeremy kingston in the times of london praised sinise as 
intense and sinewy while he pointed to a faltering in the 
second half he said for the most part galatis dramatization is 
convincingly theatrical 
milton shulman in the standard said the cast in spite of 
characters that are often too sentimental and too onedimensional 
for credibility provide ensemble acting of almost balletic 
precision 
maureen paton in the daily express sounded a notable note of 
dissent writing the cast are about as moving as mount rushmore 
it is no wonder dustin hoffman was desperate to join a british 
theater company if this is typical of what the american stage has to 
offer she said referring to the oscarwinning actors local 
appearance amid a british cast in shakespeares the merchant of 
venice 
the actors coped well with complex technical demands and the 
occasional hitch which included a fire alarm that rang for five 
minutes during the performance 
americans arrived in force to cheer on steppenwolf at the 
opening filling about 160 of the lytteltons 900 seats 
the grapes of wrath is the second production in the 
nationals international 89 series which continues in september 
with the moscow art theater performing anton chekhovs uncle 
vanya

men was executed by injection early friday 
as five guards strapped sean patrick flanagan 28 to a gurney in 
the death chamber at the nevada state prison the condemned man 
smiled and told prosecutor dan seaton i love you

a special white house file that was never 
searched contained documents in the irancontra affair touching on 
the reagan administrations aid arrangements with honduras leaders 
of the senate intelligence committee said today 
sens david boren dokla the committee chairman and william 
cohen rmaine the ranking minority member said the head of 
state file held three 1985 documents detailing an administration 
plan to slip an extra 110 million in aid to honduras if that 
country would support the contra rebels in nicaragua 
president reagan initialed his approval for the arrangement on 
one of the documents which were all originals 
the three documents werent turned over to the congressional 
irancontra committees copies of the documents found in the 
national security council files of oliver north were first disclosed 
this year at norths trial stemming from the irancontra affair 
at a news conference boren and cohen said the intelligence 
committee found no evidence in an investigation to suggest that a 
halfdozen documents including those found in the head of state 
files had been systematically withheld by the white house 
in a 51page report the committee concluded that any 
systematic effort by the white house to prevent their production 
to congress would have been difficult to accomplish 
it added that the committee cannot however absolutely rule 
out the possibility that selective efforts could have been made 
to remove certain copies of the documents 
the report attributed the failure to produce the documents to 
congress most likely to the mistaken but goodfaith 
judgment of fbi agents conducting a search for them in connection 
with the criminal investigation of the irancontra scandal 
the report also said the committee was unable to explain with 
certainty why an oct 30 1985 white house document dealing with 
airdropping recoilless rifles to the contras didnt come to the 
attention of congress

a homeless man who found shelter in a 
giant trash bin was scooped up by a rubbish truck and tossed into 
its compactor where he was found dead 
when the truck starts to pick it up i figure that guy would 
wake up and probably bounce up pretty quick and say hey guys im 
here said city sanitation manager mark gauerke 
an autopsy thursday failed to immediately determine the cause of 
death which means the man could have been dead before he was 
hoisted into the truck said los angeles county coroners spokesman 
bob dambacher 
the identity of the 41yearold man was being withheld while 
authorities tried to find relatives 
the mans body was covered with cuts and bruises but didnt 
appear crushed although he had been tossed into the compactor 
which can exert more than 17000 pounds of pressure per square inch

endorse some appointees news reports said friday 
not all candidates proposed by premier nikolai i ryzhkov were 
supported by the deputies tass reported without identifying the 
rejected appointees 
committees of the supreme soviet began hearings monday on 13 
ryzhkov aides and more than 50 ministers in an exercise of the new 
oversight powers they gained under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
political reforms 
the communist party daily newspaper pravda reported friday the 
nominees who failed to win committee endorsements were supreme court 
members and officials of the nations prosecutors office the 
newspaper did not identify the rejected candidates saying they 
still had a chance to be approved by the full supreme soviet that 
convenes monday 
deputy nikolai i ignatovich an investigator in the byelorussian 
prosecutors office told pravda he opposed the supreme court 
nominees because they were incumbents who had arbitrarily 
interpreted the law and continue to distort it he also told pravda 
the court system had not guaranteed fair trials and he held the 
nominees responsible 
pravda also gave a partial account of a supreme soviet 
committees grilling of alexandra p biryukova nominee to head the 
governments bureau of social development she has been in that post 
since last october working on consumer issues and social policy 
the newspaper said one deputy asked biryukova whether it was true 
the special department of the health ministry that provides medical 
care for the soviet elite had a budget of 6923 million and served 
only 480000 people the health ministry the deputy charged was 
spending far less per capita on ordinary citizens 
she said she didnt know the budget of the secretive fourth 
midecal department but that the figure cited was too high 
biryukova said the health ministry was placing priority on improving 
childrens hospitals and maternity clinics 
at a may 31 meeting of the parliament the congress of peoples 
deputies party maverick boris n yeltsin called for the fourth 
medical department to be used for caring for mothers and their 
children 
this should be done for the sake of our future to avoid having 
a situation when infant mortality its twice that of any civilized 
country yeltsin said 
but health minister yevgeny chazov rejected the suggestion 
saying the fourth medical departments facilities were not suitable 
for care of mothers and children 
the hearings were not televised and foreign reporters were 
barred from attending the soviet press has given them only sparse 
coverage 
tass has said that among the candidates under scrutiny were 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze defense minister dmitri t 
yazov and kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov 
the 542member supreme soviet is scheduled to meet for 40 days to 
confirm the appointees and begin drafting legislation 
in proposing the cabinet members june 10 ryzhkov said the number 
of ministries would be slashed to streamline the government

fourteen members of the dallas cowboys cheerleaders 
say they are quitting the squad because new owner jerry jones wants 
them to wear skimpier uniforms fraternize with the players and 
appear in beer commercials 
jones denied that he wanted to make such changes 
when quarterback roger staubach went out he went out on top 
they have retired im resigning cheerleader director debbie 
bond 36 said today 
in addition to ms bond all 14 veteran cheerleaders have said 
they will leave the team because of the dispute over the costumes 
the dallas morning news reported 
the 23 rookie members have until monday to decide if they will 
stay with the squad which has been training in summer camp since 
may 6 
in an early afternoon news conference at the cowboys valley 
ranch headquarters jones said the rule remains in effect calling 
for cheerleaders not to fraternize with players or employees 
those policies are intact they are a very valuable and 
timetested procedure jones said 
he said he likes the traditional uniform of the cheerleaders and 
did not plan to change it it seems as though a lot of that was 
said in the meeting was speculation he said 
ms bond who has been with the organization for 10 years said 
earlier that she talked with jones on thursday after hearing that 
the arkansas oilman had told the players there would be 
fraternization between the players and cheerleaders 
he said you can either accept it or move on ms bond 
said mr jones does not believe in rules 
jones fired tom landry the only head coach in the teams 
history on the same day he purchased the team the landry firing 
angered dallas fans who turned out by the thousands later when the 
city held a parade and ceremony in landrys honor 
under former owner hr bum bright the cheerleaders were not 
allowed to drink or even be photographed with someone holding a 
drink while they were wearing their uniforms 
twiggy isip 21 a twoyear veteran of the squad said jones 
wanted to change the uniform and do you know what he wanted 
biker shorts and a halter top he wants us to play hostess at 
parties and fraternize with the team weve never done that 
the worst thing is he wants us to be in beer commercials 
she said weve never even been able to to have a drink in our 
hand 
the current cheerleader uniform is shorts longsleeved blue 
shirts tied in the front to leave the midriff partially bare a 
fringed bolerotype vest and white boots biker shorts are made of 
an elastic material that molds to the body while a halter top 
leaves the arms and back mostly bare 
the squad that has cheered on what was once americas team set 
the standards for nfl cheerleaders beginning with super bowl x in 
1976 when a cheerleader winked into a camera and captured the 
attention of the nation ms bond said 
they had their first open auditions in the spring of 1976 and 
cheerleaders now work for 15 a game 1394 after taxes said 
suzanne mitchell who founded the squad at former president and 
general manager tex schramms suggestion 
ms mitchell resigned after 15 years with the cowboys when jones 
bought the team in february she has joined schramm at the worldwide 
league of american football 
im the one who established all those rules in the first 
place ms mitchell said today it separated the cowboys 
cheerleaders from everybody else ms mitchell said the line 
between the players and the cheerleaders was important to maintain 
respect for the performers 
ms mitchell said the squad did more than dance routines and 
shake pompons including making 18 department of defense tours 
visiting nursing homes and childrens hospitals and performing on 
telethons to raise millions of dollars for charity

an eastwest conference on human rights ended friday 
with bitter attacks on bulgaria and romania for flouting human 
rights accords during the monthlong meeting in which they took part 
delegations from the 35 nations at conference on the human 
dimension generally applauded the results but several western 
nations closed with final attacks on bulgaria and romania for 
disregarding the accords 
the soviet union in its first public stance against an east bloc 
ally implicitly chastised romania for building a barbedwire fence 
on its border with hungary 
the helsinki final act makes no mention of a barbed wall 
chief soviet delegate yuri kashlev said at a news conference if 
we were the romanians we wouldnt have done it 
hungarian authorities announced this week that romania already 
under criticism for its treatment of dissidents and ethnic 
minorities has been building a barbedwire fence on its border 
while the delegates met the rate of expulsions of ethnic turks 
living in bulgaria mounted an estimated 50000 have been expelled 
or invited to leave on short notice the move follows resistance by 
bulgarias ethnic turkish population to an assimilation campaign 
begun in 1984 
chief us delegate morris b abram said he was outraged at 
the conduct of bulgaria and romania we are and every delegate 
here should be offended at the contempt that these countries have 
shown for their neighbors he said in a final address 
french foreign minister roland dumas called on bulgaria to end 
the exodus while chief dutch delegate max van der stoel called it a 
human tragedy and denounced the romanian fence as a new iron 
curtain in the heart of europe 
the paris conference is the first of three human rights meetings 
being held by the conference for security and cooperation in europe 
in the framework of the 1975 helsinki accords 
we have taken yet another step to consolidate the humanitarian 
breakthrough started in vienna from confrontation toward 
interaction kashlev told the assembly 
the iron curtain is melting at the edges abram said 
noting that hungary challenged romania and none of the delegates 
stood up in defense of bulgaria i think were beginning to see a 
thaw 
abram praised changes in hungary poland and the soviet union 
under a fourtiered mechanism worked out in vienna the member 
nations can call other nations to account for human rights abuses 
romania also drew criticism for rejecting the mechanism 
at a bilateral meeting friday the soviet union informed the 
united states that a number of pending emigration cases had been 
resolved abram announced he called the soviet action one of the 
effects of this meeting 
but the soviet union clearly has not gone far enough he told 
delegates 
the united states has set conditions for attending a 1991 
conference in moscow that there be no backsliding on human 
rights that there be clear progress and that free access to 
protesters dissidents and nongovernmental organizations be 
guaranteed 
no final document of the conferences work was issued and none 
of the more than 30 proposals tabled was adopted the proposals are 
to be taken up at the next meeting in copenhagen in 1990 and in 
moscow

the house on friday sent to president bush a 
35 billion emergency spending bill for veterans education 
refugee assistance and other programs requiring a cash infusion this 
year 
the fiscal 1989 supplemental appropriations bill approved by the 
senate thursday night passed the house 3186 only two days after 
the chamber rejected a version that would have sparked a veto fight 
with the president 
president bush was expected to sign the revised bill which was 
stripped of 821 million house democrats had earmarked for antidrug 
programs the white house contended federal agencies already had all 
the money they could spend this year 
the new version adds just 75 million for the antidrug effort 
with that money coming from deferring spending on two other programs 
until fiscal 1990 
either we ought to get in there and try to win the war on drugs 
or we ought to get out of there said rep neal smith diowa who 
promised to fight again for increased antidrug spending in the 
future 
what we have established so far is that the administration 
supports wideranging drug legislation but does not support the 
kind of resources that are necessary to make it effective said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
despite continuing arguments over the drug money and some other 
items in the bill the house overwhelmingly decided it could no 
longer continue fighting and leave veterans facing health care 
cutbacks over congress fourth of july recess 
the largest single item in the bill is 12 billion for the 
department of veterans affairs of which 340 million is for medical 
care compensation and pensions loans and other veterans programs 
also would get more money 
the bill also covers a mosaic of other federal programs lawmakers 
said could not wait until the next fiscal year for more money 
those include nearly 900 million to the federal guaranteed 
student loan program 342 million to cover the cost of fighting 
last years widespread forest fires and 423 million for foster 
care and adoption 
the food stamp program would be increased 225 million and aid to 
the unemployed 90 million an estimated 24500 soviet refugees 
would be aided as a result of 100 million in new assistance 
allocated for them and emigres from eastern europe africa and asia 
congress budget rules say the bill must contain money only for 
dire emergencies but lawmakers took advantage of the mustpass 
nature of the legislation to attach their favorite projects 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd dwva 
in the compromise cut in half the 75 million he had inserted for 
rebuilding a radiotelescope for scientists in his home state he 
agreed to wait until next year to provide the rest of the money 
the balance of the 75 million allocated for the drug programs 
would come from deferring some agriculture spending 
the bill also would 
add 90 million for benefits and training for the unemployed 
provide 66 million to continue subsidies of air passenger 
service to small communities which commercial companies would 
otherwise drop from their schedules 
require the installation of devices at airports which could 
detect plastic explosives 
earmark 125 million for united nations peacekeeping activities 
provide 15 million divided three ways for puerto ricos three 
political parties for participation in determining the islands 
future political status

a flag from outer space joined superabsorbent 
diapers a teflon frying pan and heated ski boots on friday at an 
exhibit of space spinoffs everyday products developed through 
space research 
astronaut jerry ross took an official museum of science and 
industry flag into space on the 1988 atlantis space shuttle mission 
and returned the flag to the museum as a memento for the exhibit 
even though we put a little over 18 million miles on that flag 
in four days its still in good shape ross said as he presented 
the royal blue and white nylon flag bearing the museums name and 
initials 
ross 41 a native of nearby crown point ind used to visit the 
museum as a boy and wanted to take on the atlantis mission a 
reminder of a place that helped spark his interest in space 
it captured my imagination and helped foster the goals i had 
of becoming an astronaut he told a small crowd gathered at the 
south side museum 
the flag was stored in a vacuumsealed container in a subfloor 
portion of the spacecraft during the december flight ross said it 
will be displayed permanently at the museum 
while the flag doesnt exactly qualify as a space spinoff it 
easily upstaged the 100 such items on display for several little 
boys whose eyes sparkled with delight as they watched ross wearing 
his dark blue spacesuit present the flag to james kahn the 
museums director 
the real space spinoffs are consumer products and industrial 
processes that were developed through three decades of space 
research 
more than 30000 items including velcro and the jarvik 
artificial heart have been developed from technology associated 
with the nations space program 
one display case features a shiny potato chip bag made from a 
material similar to that which formed the skin of a radio satellite 
used in the 1960s 
another contains a pair of ski boots equipped with a 
batteryoperated heating element that can be turned on or off the 
boots were patterned after boot liners for lunar spacesuits 
and theres a ceramic tennis racket and fishing reel developed 
from early use of graphite composite materials during the 1973 
skylab missions 
ross also donated to the exhibit a photograph he took of chicago 
while traveling 5 miles a second about 270 miles above earth 
the museum shows up on the picture as a miniscule dot adjacent to 
the lake michigan shoreline 
the traveling exhibit which originated in fort worth texas 
opened june 19 in chicago in september it will travel to science 
museums in boston philadelphia and other cities it was designed 
and produced by the fort worth museum of science and history

president bush reassured senators friday of the 
united states unwavering and unquestioned support of israel 
after questions were raised by a speech given by secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
reaffirmed the united states commitment to israel speaking of 
our unwaving and unquestioned support he said israel is a steadfast 
ally and friend 
moreover fitzwater reiterated that the united states views 
israeli prime minister yitzkhak shamirs proposal for elections in 
the occupied territories as a very helpful proposal that we want 
to pursue with all the parties in the region 
the senators asked for a meeting with the president after baker 
said last month that israel should renounce the unrealistic vision 
of a greater israel meaning the jewish state should forswear 
annexation of the west bank and gaza strip 
baker also urged israel to stop settlement activity in the 
occupied lands and allow palestinian schools to reopen the speech 
did not represent a change in us policy but the tone of bakers 
remarks was viewed as a toughening of us rhetoric 
shamir called bakers speech useless 
after the meeting with bush sen howard metzenbaum dohio said 
there has been some misinterpretation of us policy 
but i dont think that the president could have been stronger 
in indicating the recognition on the part of the united states that 
israel is our strongest ally in the middle east and a reaffirmation 
of continued concern and assistance and working together 
sen joseph biden ddel said the meeting was intended to 
make sure that we all understood where the president was with regard 
to his view on the elections policy proposed by the israeli 
government 
and he reinforced to us that he believed it was extremeley 
useful and an extremely courageous move by the shamir government and 
that he was strongly supportive of that initiative biden said 
biden said bushed wanted to dispel the notion that bakers speech 
was a change in policy 
there is no change in policy on the part of the united 
states biden said after the meeting israel is the first among 
equals in the region and israel in fact is going through a 
difficult period that the president fully understands and fully 
intends on continuing to support

peri disappeared from his unit feb 20 crossing the border into

parents behind my friends behind taking what i had coming was 
better

security officials in civilian clothes interrogated him at a house 
north of east berlin 
just before leaving east germany peri said he asked communist 
officials to hand back the computer and discs and they complied

conducted on peri after his arrest 
he was so wrapped up with himself that he could not make

schearer chief of the psychiatry section of the 97th general

without leave wrongfully appropriating government property and 
entering a restricted zone without permission

israeli troops and allied lebanese 
christian militia advanced friday on southeast lebanon and attacked 
proiranian guerrillas police said 
israeli military officials initially said they were not involved 
but an army spokeswoman said later that israeli troops participated 
in one of two attacks staged by their militia allies the south 
lebanon army 
four guerrillas were killed and one soldier was slightly wounded 
the spokeswoman said 
hezbollah or party of god said at least two of its guerrillas 
were killed and two wounded 
about 300 israeli troops and christian militiamen advanced in 35 
armored personnel carriers amid a barrage of artillery fire while 
three israeli helicopter gunships hovered above lebanese police 
said 
attackers fought their way into the villages of kawkaba 
dellafeh kfar houna and mydoun three to four miles north of the 
security zone in the syriancontrolled western bekaa valley said a 
police spokesman 
they blew up several houses in searches for suspected hezbollah 
guerrillas said the spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations 
villagers fled to towns to the north he added 
the israeli army spokeswoman said israels action outside the 
security zone was designed to foil the organization and activities 
of the terrorists 
she said the guerrillas fired katyusha rockets into the security 
zone during the attack 
lebanese police said five howitzer shells from the attackers fell 
near syrian army positions 2 miles north of the villages but the 
syrians did not retaliate 
israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of 
its invading army from south lebanon in summer 1985 ending a 
threeyear occupation 
it uses the six to 10miledeep enclave as a buffer against 
crossborder guerrilla attacks israeli troops and south lebanon 
army militiamen patrol the zone

four democratic lawmakers introduced 
legislation friday withdrawing 10000 us troops from south korea 
by 1992 arguing that the asian nation must assume a greater defense 
burden 
more than 35 years after the end of the korean war we still 
maintain 43000 troops in south korea said sen dale bumpers of 
arkansas the rationale for this presence which costs 26 
billion a year has grown weaker every year as the south korean 
economy has gotten stronger 
bumpers and sen bennett johnston of louisiana joined lloyd 
bentsen of texas and kent conrad of north dakota in sponsoring the 
bill that requires pulling out 10000 army personnel over three 
years 
about 21000 troops and two air force wings of about 12000 
troops would remain 
the measure also would require president bush to report to 
congress by may 1990 on withdrawing all us forces from south korea 
the united states should allow the south koreans to more fully 
shoulder the burden of defending themselves against their poorer 
smaller neighbor to the north bumpers said 
on thursday a handful of democratic lawmakers urged defense 
secretary dick cheney to reject any agreement with south korea that 
would require the united states to maintain troops at current levels 
members cited a recent letter that south korean defense minister 
lee sanghoon sent to cheney asking the united states to promise not 
to withdraw american troops 
at a hearing of the senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
bumpers argued that south koreas gross national product is seven 
times that of north korea its population twice that of north korea 
and it only spends 5 percent of its gnp on defense 
cheney said the united states has no plans to reduce the us 
committment to korea but that cuts in troop levels are possible 
just as there is a proposal to reduce our troop level in europe

a severe shortage of covered hopper cars to 
carry grain will develop by the end of this century unless railroads 
buy new ones an agriculture department official said friday 
martin buzz fitzpatrick jr administrator of the 
departments office of transportation said grain shippers 
experienced severe car shortages a year ago and could run into them 
again as early as 1991 
in early 1988 there was a two to sixweek delay for shippers 
in getting grain cars he said for some shippers the delay was 
as high as 14 weeks 
fitzpatrick said a study at the time showed the cause was a 
shrinking and aging grain car fleet combined with increased 
demand particularly for grain exports 
a recent followup study shows that since 1982 virtually no new 
cars have been added to the nations railcar fleet at the same 
time more cars are being lost each year as the result of accidents 
derailments and retirements because of age 
the bottom line is that todays fleet of 98600 cars used for 
grain shipments will drop to 66300 by they year 2001 fitzpatrick 
said our study shows the peak fleet requirement for that year to 
be 96000 cars resulting in a projected deficit of nearly 30000 
cars 
currently railroads own about 60 percent of the jumbo 
coveredhopper grain cars and shippers own the rest 
if this ratio is to be maintained the primary burden of adding 
new rail cars for grain shipments lies with the railroads because 
82 percent of the cars over 20 years old are owned by the 
railroads he said 
fitzpatrick spoke at a luncheon for transportation writers 
sponsored by the national press club

centrist politician patricio aylwin won 
the backing friday of three key socialist groups ensuring he will 
be the candidate of a united opposition in elections to pick gen 
augusto pinochets successor 
the army meanwhile warned that it would use force if necessary 
to defend pinochets right to remain their commander after the 
december vote 
two major socialist party factions and the prosocialist party 
for democracy announced they are setting aside ideological 
differences to support aylwin a christian democrat in his bid to 
be the democratic president of all chileans 
aylwin in a speech accepting the parties support emphasized 
the urgency for unity in the opposition 
we have been adversaries in the past the 70yearold lawyer 
and former senate president told his leftist allies but the time 
has come to put aside our differences and work together to rebuild 
democracy 
as the ceremony came to an end the dissidents spontaneously sang 
the national anthem 
with fridays endorsements aylwin has won support from all the 
main groups in the 17party opposition coalition he will be 
formally nominated by the entire coalition july 4 said claudio 
vasquez a coalition leader 
aylwin president of the christian democratic party the 
countrys largest was the oppositions chief spokesman in its 
successful campaign for pinochets defeat in a referendum last 
october voters rejected a military proposal that pinochet remain in 
power until 1997 
the referendum defeat obliged pinochet who has ruled since a 
bloody 1973 coup to call presidential and congressional elections 
scheduled for dec 14 
the new government is to take power march 11 1990 
opinion polls indicate aylwin is likely to defeat any rightist 
progovernment candidate conservative progovernment forces have 
yet to agree on a candidate but the most probable appears to be 
sergio onofre jarpa a 68yearold former senator and interior 
minister under pinochet 
jarpa however has met opposition among the most staunchly 
propinochet groups who support hernan buchi pinochets 
40yearold former finance minister buchi has said he will not run 
but is reportedly reconsidering his decision 
most legal experts say pinochet is barred from running by a 
constitutional clause prohibiting presidential reelection although 
he has flipflopped on the issue in the past pinochet on tuesday 
said he would not be a candidate 
ricardo lagos president of the party for democracy said the 
17party opposition coalition already has reached a global 
agreement to nominate aylwin 
chiles interests are above the interests of our parties 
lagos said we are not going to elect just a president we are 
going to elect the man who will rebuild a democratic system that has 
been trampled by the dictatorship 
if elected aylwin said his government will seek justice for the 
victims of human rights violations under the pinochet government and 
punishment for those found responsible 
that is an open wound which will not heal unless the truth is 
discovered and justice is achieved aylwin said but well seek 
justice not revenge 
the opposition has said pinochet must relinquish command of the 
powerful 60000member armed forces 
but in statement read friday by col fritz ladevig the army said 
it has the unavoidable mission to safeguard the constitutional 
order either through respresentations or in their absence through 
the use of legitimate force 
the constitution pushed through by pinochets administration in 
1980 allows all armed forces chiefs to remain in their posts for 
eight more years

a judge who was told that evidence shows pete 
rose bet on his own team said today he would rule at noon sunday on 
a request by the cincinnati reds manager to delay a meeting with 
baseballs commissioner 
john m dowd outlined the evidence saying his investigation 
found telephone records taped conversations checks signed by rose 
and betting sheets that have been verified as bearing roses 
handwriting 
the evidence is substantial with nine witnesses giving 
information about rose betting on baseball games including reds 
contests dowd said 
while defending his report thursday against attacks by roses 
lawyers dowd said hes taken no enjoyment from presenting the case 
against rose who has the most career hits 
do i like it no dowd said there isnt a day i havent 
felt enormous sadness about this matter 
dowd unveiled the case against rose during a hearing for roses 
lawsuit against baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti 
rose sued him earlier this week asserting the commissioner is 
biased and has already decided against him 
the hearing thursday was on roses request for a temporary 
restraining order that would block his monday meeting with giamatti 
in new york the final step before the commissioner decides the 
case 
if giamatti determines rose bet on reds games which the manager 
has steadfastly denied he could ban him from baseball for life 
dowd was questioned today by roses lawyers to complete the 
hearing hamilton county common pleas judge norbert a nadel said he 
would issue a ruling sunday 
under pointed crossexamination by robert g stachler one of 
roses lawyers dowd said repeatedly that giamatti has not yet 
decided roses fate 
dowd repeated today that corroborative evidence indicated peters 
was being truthful when he said rose bet on reds games but he 
became testy when stachler rephrased his questions several times in 
an attempt to get dowd to say giamatti had made a determination in 
the case when he sent the letter on behalf of bookmaker ronald 
peters to a federal judge as part of the peters sentencing 
on thursday baseball attorney louis l hoynes jr told nadel 
that its important to let the commissioner use his full authority 
in deciding roses case 
whats at stake here is the integrity of the game of 
majorleague baseball hoynes said 
the evidence is contained in a 225page report by dowd and seven 
volumes of exhibits that were wheeled into the courtroom thursday 
nadel has decided to keep the report confidential against hoynes 
wishes 
there is evidence substantial and heavily corroborated 
evidence that mr rose bet large sums of money on majorleague 
baseball games and on games of the cincinnati reds hoynes said 
hoynes and dowds statements were the first confirmation by the 
commissioners office that it had evidence rose bet on baseball 
games 
dowd explained that the report involves testimony and evidence 
from more than 80 witnesses and is broken into segments it opens 
with a summary of the findings and is followed by a chronological 
narrative of the investigation 
of the nine witnesses who supplied information that rose bet on 
baseball and reds games only two have been in trouble with the 
law dowd said blunting contentions by roses lawyers that the 
report was based on the testimony of criminals 
nine other witnesses told the investigators that rose didnt bet 
on baseball 
roses lawyers are trying to get the judge to disqualify giamatti 
on grounds hes already decided that rose is guilty thus depriving 
the manager of a fair hearing next week 
the basic foundation of a fair hearing is missing stachler 
told nadel 
baseballs lawyers provided a memorandum thursday from giamatti 
who said he hasnt yet made up his mind on the case

more than 20 years after north koreas capture 
of the spy ship uss pueblo the us government on friday reversed 
itself and agreed to give medals to all 82 aboard who were held 
captive and tortured for 11 months 
vice admiral jm boorda chief of naval personnel told a house 
armed services subcommittee of the decision at a hearing that 
featured emotional testimony from lloyd bucher the pueblos retired 
commander 
the navy feels that the circumstances of pueblo meet the spirit 
and intent of a medal for prisoners of war established by congress 
in 1985 boorda said in testimony he said was specifically 
authorized by the pentagon and the bush administration 
i personally feel that we as a nation should recognize the 
sacrifices made by these crew members he said they have earned 
it 
bucher said his men had been dumbfounded justifiably angry and 
deeply hurt when they at first were denied pow medals that was 
due to a finding by pentagon lawyers that they were techically 
detainees rather than prisoners of war because there was no open 
conflict between the united states and north korea at the time of 
the jan 23 1968 capture 
his voice halted as he concluded his testimony mr chairman 
those men were americas sons they did as bid by this country and 
more 
in an interview later he called the legal reasoning behind the 
denial of medals contrived and said it hid the real reason the 
medals were denied 
they were looking at us like something youd want to put under 
the rug it was a calamity for our country to be captured at noon 
on the high seas its an embarrassment to a lot of people its 
gone down as something that most elements of our government would 
rather forget about 
buchers surrender of his small ship loaded with intelligence 
information was harshly criticized later and he even was 
recommended for a court martial although that request was denied 
i dont appreciate being secondguessed but i know its 
inevitable in this world bucher said its been kind of an 
uphill battle to win the recognition he said his crew deserves 
most of the crew members were teenagers at the time of the 
capture he said during their captivity they were beaten with 
pieces of lumber burned on radiators and had their teeth kicked out 
by north korean soldiers 
those guys went from teenage to adulthood in one hell of a 
hurry and they did it with a degree of dignity and courage that has 
never been exceeded in the history of this countys military 
bucher said 
rep jim slattery dkan has introduced legislation 
specifically recognizing the the pueblo crew 77 of whom are still 
alive as eligible for the pow medal slattery said he was alterted 
to the problem by a crew member steven woelk of mclouth kan who 
was permanently disabled in the attack 
boorda said the pentagon would support legislation to amend the 
law so the pueblo crew could receive the pow medal

master teddy a white spitz who lives in a 
102000 dog house wont have to get his leg tattooed to satisfy 
heirs of his former owner that a lookalike canine wont move in 
when teddy dies 
the six heirs gave up their legal battle friday but the aging 
teddy will have to give up some of the privacy of his threebedroom 
silver spring home 
everybodys going to look at this dog everybody in the 
world said karl g feissner an attorney for the dogs caretaker 
the agreement reached friday will allow a detailed inspection of 
the dogs body to satisfy all parties that another dog has not been 
substituted 
the caretaker and teddys veterinarian said tattooing the dogs 
hind leg would inflict needless trauma on him since the animal 
could be identified by photographs and xrays 
i think theyre nuts said caretaker george j schnabele 74 
a retired policeman who has known teddy since puppyhood i dont 
know what the relatives are thinking of 
ralph gordon who represents the heirs said his clients did not 
want publicity and refused to discuss the case 
when celeste v crawford died of cancer in 1984 her will said 
teddy could live in her home the rest of his life schnabele who 
has rented the basement apartment since 1968 would be permitted to 
stay there to look after the pet 
the bequest upset mrs crawfords sisters and brothers who went 
to court seeking permission to sell the house and divide the 
proceeds but a montgomery county circuit judge ruled three years 
ago they would have to wait until the dogs death 
teddy has turned out to be resilient he is now 13 years old 
the equivalent of 90 to 93 years old in human terms and could live 
for several more years said veterinarian kt somaiah who has 
cared for the dog for 10 years 
after losing their bid to sell the house the heirs demanded the 
dog be tattooed as a safeguard against possible dognapping another 
veterinarian chester a anderson said in an affidavit that 
tattooing was a quick painless and permanent method for 
identifying a dog 
but feissner disagreed suggesting that if the judge approved the 
tattoing the heirs should be tattooed too so we know whos who 
legal wrangling over the estate may not be over said executor 
gilbert tietz 
unfortunately everything in this case has become a court 
battle he said

the food and drug administration is allowing 
expanded use of a new drug that shows promise in extending the lives 
of gravely ill patients with advanced colon cancer 
the agency approved more widespread use of the drug levamisole 
without waiting for study results to be published because it shows 
real promise of being very effective said spokesman jeff nesbit 
the drug is being made available for use with the approved cancer 
drug 5fluorouracil under the fdas treatment investigational new 
drug regulations that status allows drug developers to release 
promising drugs to gravely ill patients before complete information 
on the drugs safety and effectiveness is available and sufficient 
for commercial approval 
the national cancer institute which developed the drug 
estimated that 25000 patients a year will be eligible for treatment 
with levamisole 
about a dozen drugs have been approved under similar 
circumstances the fda said 
though the fda has not released details on the effectiveness of 
the drug the fda described the study results in general terms 
saying the combination of levamisole and 5fluorouracil in patients 
who had undergone surgical colon removal produced a significant 
reduction in tumor recurrence and a delay in those recurrences that 
did occur 
the washington post reported in its thursday editions a dispute 
between physicians who believe the decision should have awaited 
publication of results on 408 patients in a forthcoming issue of the 
journal of clinical oncology and physicians who believe a clearly 
beneficial drug should not be withheld until publication 
colon cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of death 
from cancer in the united states about 44000 people in the united 
states will die from colon cancer this year and 110000 new cases 
will be diagnosed the fda said

hospitalized caretaker premier andreas 
papandreou was asked friday to try to form a new government after 
leftist parties refused to join the conservatives in an alliance 
greeces political impasse developed after no party or alliance 
gained a majority in sundays election for the 300member parliament 
constantine mitsotakis conservative new demoracy won a plurality 
and 145 seats the incumbent papandreous panhellenic socialist 
movement or pasok got 125 seats and the coalition of the left and 
progress wound up as the power broker with 28 an independent and 
small party won the two other seats 
president christos sartzetakis first asked mitsitakis to form a 
new government but he could not reach an arrangment with the 
communist coalition 
sartzetakis then turned to papandreou who governed greece for 
eight years with the last few years embroiled in scandals 
papandreou 70 was admitted to an athens hospital thursday night 
with breathing difficulties

suggested he was seeking to avoid a political showdown 
using his sickness as an excuse andreas is leaving he 
definitely lost the game he is withdrawing from the political 
scene said the afternoon daily apoyevmatini 
sartzetakis phoned papandreou at his hospital room and reportedly 
told him he had until tuesday night to form a government 
papandreou issued a statement saying he would try to reach 
agreement with harilaos florakis leader of the coalition of left 
and progress 
in the next few days i will take the initiative to meet 
coalition general secretary mr florakis during our talks i will 
have the chance to present pasoks positions and commitments for a 
viable government said papandreou 
because of the continued uncertainty it was announced sartzetakis 
would replace papandreou at a twoday summit meeting of the european 
economic community opening monday in madrid 
medical bulletins said papandreous is capable of handling the 
duties of the premiers office but he underwent heart surgery last 
september in london and his health is fragile

hospital said papandreou had pneumonia it did not say how long he 
might remain in the hospital

news conference he was saddened by the leftist coalitions rejection 
of his proposal to form an interim government 
coalition members are the moscowline greek communist party and 
the eurocommunist greek left party 
mitsotakis 71 had been given 72 hours to form a government 
i offered two crucial ministries to the left the justice 
ministry and the interior ministry the key ministry if one wants to 
hold elections he said 
he added the communist coalition now could be blamed if people in 
papandreous government who were responsible of wrongdoings escaped 
prosecution 
members of papandreous administration have been accused of 
corrupt deals in arms and banking a 200million embezzlement 
scandal involving the bank of crete resulted in the dismissals or 
resignations of eight ministers 
two former pasok ministers have been charged with receiving 
payoffs from the former owner of the bank of crete george koskotas 
now in custody in the united states awaiting a hearing on his 
extradition to greece 
mitsotakis said a new government must be formed quickly in light 
of a new scandal involving the national mortgage bank of greece in 
the united states 
greece is being shamed internationally something must be done 
in order to prosecute the responsible parties he said 
representatives of the national mortgage bank were arrested in 
four us cities on wednesdy and charged with laundering about 700 
million for movement out of the country

the tanker exxon valdez on friday 
began its long slow journey to san diego for 25 million in 
renovations to repair the hull it shredded on a reef three months 
ago causing the nations worst oil spill 
seas were calm but fog and a low ceiling shrouded the 987foot 
vessel as it lifted anchor and began moving under tow by two 
tugboats exxon spokesman henry beathard said 
a lone fishing boat dwarfed by the crippled hulk of the tanker 
circled in silent protest as the ship was pulled from its protected 
anchorage at outside bay on naked island 
thick cable and chains stretching from two 7000horsepower 
tugboats formed a yoke for the tanker as it crept toward 
hinchenbrook entrance and the gulf of alaska 
a third tug was attached to the tankers stern and a salvage boat 
trailed not far behind the end of the raindrenched procession was 
brought up by two escort vessels loaded with 9000 feet of 
containment boom and each carrying an oil skimming vessel with 4000 
barrels capacity 
progress was slow initially and the tanker moved only about two 
miles in the first two hours because of some turns it had to make 
to get out in the channel beathard said 
once adjustments are made the speed is expected to increase to 
about 5 mph meaning it should take about 20 days to cover the 2500 
miles to the san diego drydock where it was built nearly three years 
ago 
i must say were not sorry to see it go gov steve cowper 
said at a news conference in juneau 
the coast guard said there was minimal danger of additional 
pollution from the ship as it moves down the west coast about 100 
miles offshore 
its stable and clean exxon spokesman joe tucker said i 
understand there are some fish swimming in one of the tanks 
an exxon shipping co official expressed optimism that the vessel 
would make it to san diego for its nine months of repairs 
if anybody thought there was a concern the ship wouldnt be 
going said shipping coordinator paul meyers exxon is very 
confident based on calculations and two months of work that its 
going to be ok 
there is roughly a 1 percent chance that the vessel would 
encounter a wave that could cause it a problem said meyers who 
was aboard an exxonchartered boat ferrying reporters and 
photographers to watch the exxon valdez depart 
the exxon valdez had been en route to long beach calif on 
march 24 when it struck bligh reef bleeding nearly 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude oil into thenpristine prince william 
sound 
the spill killed thousands of birds and sea mammals and spoiled 
hundreds of miles of coastline it also dealt a severe blow to 
alaskas 2 billion fishing industry forcing officials to ban 
postpone or restrict fishing in polluted areas 
al kapp skipper of the salmon seiner journeyman out of 
california posted a handletered sign on the side of his boat as he 
ushered the exxon valdez away 
thanks a lot exxon the sign said 
kapp speaking by radio to the media vessel said fishing 
closures in the sound this season have hurt him its disrupted my 
life its disrupted our industry its not going to be a normal 
season 
after the accident authorities pumped the remaining oil from the 
ship into other tankers refloated it and towed the crippled vessel 
to an anchorage off an oilfouled beach on naked island about 24 
miles from bligh reef 
for the past two months divers and specialists have worked to 
stabilize the ship and patch it up for its journey south eight of 
the ships 13 cargo tanks were breached in the accident and it 
suffered major damage to more than half of its bottom exxon 
officials said 
as i understand it the valdez will not be moving under its own 
power he said but they engines are capable of being fired 
up the vessel will be towed with the onboard power plant available 
as necessary 
seven exxon officers and four salvage experts were aboard for the 
trip to san diego tucker said they will monitor air pressure in 
the vessels cargo tanks conduct inspections and be ready to help 
with the ships engines 
repairing the tanker will require the replacement of 3000 tons 
of steel that comprises about 10 percent of the vessels structure 
said officials with national steel and shipbuilding co which is 
repairing the ship it built 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi has said the ship will 
be rebuilt to original specifications which include a single hull 
the coast guard on wednesday approved exxons towing proposal and 
issued the necessary permits allowing the move 
the coast guard will be aboard to monitor the ships movement as 
it leaves prince william sound and again as it enters the approach 
to san diego said lt alan carr a coast guard spokesman 
exxon and the alyeska pipeline service co have been criticized 
for their slow handling of the spill during the first few days when 
winds were calm seas were flat and before the oil spread 
today oil with a sludgelike consistency can be found on the 
alaska peninsula some 700 miles from the reef 
the tankers former captain joseph hazelwood faces three felony 
counts of criminal mischief and misdemeanors including negligent 
discharge of pollutants and operating a vessel while drunk the 
42yearold mariner has pleaded innocent to all charges he is free

documents were sometimes handled in 
haphazard and chaotic way during the congressional 
investigation of the irancontra affair but there is no evidence of 
a calculated coverup by the reagan administration the senate 
intelligence committee said friday 
we have a situation where theres a lot of fault to go around 
on all sides said sen william cohen rmaine vice chairman of 
the committee and a member of the congressional panel which 
investigated the irancontra scandal in 1987 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine also a member of 
the investigating committee asked the intelligence panel to look 
into the handling of documents after six important memos were 
produced at the trial of oliver north which the investigators had 
either not seen or seen in different versions 
in a 51page report the intelligence committee found 
there was no evidence to suggest that the documents relating to 
an arrangement under which honduras would support the nicaraguan 
contras in exchange for expedited us aid had been deliberately 
and systematically withheld by the white house 
but david boren dokla the committee chairman said he could 
never rule out completely the possibility that someone could 
have removed documents from certain files to prevent finding them in 
any of several searches 
one key memo a feb 19 1985 message to president reagan from 
thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane missed during 
document searches turned up last month in a box of papers at the 
reagan library in california the memo recommends a letter be sent 
to honduran president roberto suazo stating the united states 
deep conviction to support the contras along with a promise to 
defend honduras against any incursion from nicaragua 
the memo strongly suggests the kind of quid pro quo 
arrangement with honduras that has been denied by president bush it 
was not turned up during two searches of nsc files but was found in 
an informal heads of state file at the presidential library that 
has never been searched by investigators the report said 
boren and cohen said the headsofstate file held three 1985 
documents detailing an administration plan to slip an extra 110 
million in aid to honduras if that country would support the contras 
in nicaragua reagan initialed his approval for the arrangement on 
one of the documents which were all originals 
a document released at the north trial an oct 30 1985 memo 
mentioning the illegal airdrop of two artillery pieces to the 
contras and asking that reagan be informed of them also was not 
received by congressional investigators the committee could not 
explain why it had not been turned up during searches 
congressional investigators relied on the good faith of the 
white house and made no independent check to see whether all 
documents they asked for were indeed being found and never knew 
exactly what criteria were being used by those searching for 
documents 
most decisions on which papers were relevant to the investigation 
were being made by fbi agents and the white house officials 
congress believed were making the decisions had little actual 
involvement the report said 
cohen said the process was very very haphazard and fairly 
chaotic but he and boren said the shortcomings do not taint the 
findings of the irancontra committees the committees got the 
story their report concluded 
in a statement mitchell said the report of necessity leaves 
some questions unanswered reflecting the great difficulty in 
determining the precise handling of particular documents given the 
more than 70000 pages of documents produced by the white house 
boren and cohen also said they would not be surprised if the 
upcoming trials of former national security adviser john poindexter 
and other figures in the affair produce additional new evidence that 
the congressional investigators have not seen 
that would be the appropriate place now for these questions to 
be answered boren said

a houston company is withdrawing from the 
energy departments 25 billion program for developing cleaner ways 
of burning coal the department said friday 
mw kellogg co notified the department june 1 that it wanted to 
withdraw because it could not find a place to build a proposed 
electric power plant that would attempt to demonstrate a technique 
in which coal is changed to a gas the gas would then be used to 
power both a gas turbine and a steam turbine 
mary jo zacchero a department spokesman said the withdrawal was 
accepted friday 
kellogg is the first participant to withdraw from the project 
since it began in 1986 
kellogg with project partner bechtel development co of san 
francisco had received about 900000 in energy department money 
since it signed an agreement on jan 22 1988 to proceed with the 
project the eventual cost was to be 244 million 
zacchero said kellogg was obligated to repay the 900000 if it 
eventually developed the technology and put it to commercial use if 
it does not the money will not be repaid she said 
zacchero said kellogg wanted to build the plant in johnstown 
penn but was unable to reach agreement with the local utility 
company on a contract to purchase power from the proposed plant 
alternative sites in new york and virginia also were discarded 
nobody had anything bad to say about the technology the 
economics just arent there yet ms zacchero said 
the department also said it had decided to open negotiations on a 
cleancoal proposal from the city of tallahassee fla the city has 
proposed building an advanced cleanburning coal combustor it would 
be the first largescale utility boiler of this type to burn 
eastern high sulfur bituminous coal 
the energy department now has nine participants in its cleancoal 
program and is negotiating terms of participation agreements with 20 
others including tallahassee

the government has increased prices of 
ordinary bread slightly and doubled the cost of betterquality 
loaves in a move that could cause street protests 
the new prices were decreed thursday by a government committee 
appointed to ease the burden of soaring living costs on poor 
sudanese 
a fiveounce loaf of brown bread will cost 125 cents up from 
117 cents and premium white bread went up from 212 cents a loaf 
to 425 cents 
only welltodo sudanese can afford premium bread and they are in 
a minority in this nation of 22 million that according to the world 
bank is among the poorest in the world 
in raising prices the committee failed to set production quotas 
for the two kinds of bread this raised fears that bakeries intent 
on profit will concentrate on producing premium bread and aggravate 
existing shortages 
the government was forced to abandon announced price increases in 
december when raises in prices of sugar cigarettes and other 
commodities sparked street riots and clashes with police in which 
four people were killed 
the opposition national islamic front which has a substantial 
following protested the new prices 
its newspaper alraya published interviews friday with angry 
citizens and quoted one unidentified man as saying we will not 
allow the government to increase prices under the cover of 
alleviating the burden of living costs these increases will not 
happen 
commodity shortages are common in sudan saddled with a 13 
billion foreign debt and sixyear southern civil war that costs 1 
million daily

a private detective agency hired by oliver 
norths lawyers discovered information about an irancontra trial 
juror that caused norths sentencing to be delayed the defense 
revealed friday 
lawyers for the former white house aide said the defense embarked 
on a background check of juror tara leigh king after norths trial 
ended in a guilty verdict on three criminal charges may 4 
kings failure to acknowledge in a pretrial questionnaire court 
proceedings involving four brothers and sisters has moved back 
norths sentencing which had been scheduled for friday to july 5 
one of her brothers had pleaded guilty to armed robbery 
granting a request from north us district court judge gerhard 
a gesell will hold a hearing wednesday to focus on king and her 
failure to disclose the background information to the court 
the defense was alerted to allegations about king on may 5 when a 
local tv news reporter said king admitted smoking crack cocaine up 
until four months before the north trial according to the defenses 
court filing friday 
north wrote all the jurors may 11 seeking to question them five 
days later during an interview with a source we were told that 
a brother had drug problems had been picked up by the police 
and had been involved in a prosecution the court filing said 
norths lawyers hired a detective agency the investigative 
group which on may 30 turned over to north documents on criminal 
proceedings involving two of kings brothers and turned over 
additional material on another brother and a sister on june 8 
king responded negatively on a pretrial questionnaire when asked 
whether she or any member of her immediate family ever had been 
involved in a court proceeding or in an investigation 
norths court filing said there is absolutely no basis for 
suggesting that the defense knew about kings background before the 
verdict in the north case 
the prosecution said a defendant cannot learn of juror 
misconduct during the trial gamble on a favorable verdict by 
remaining silent and then complain in a postverdict motion 
norths lawyers said king has refused to talk to them 
on friday gesell appointed a local attorney vincent alto to 
represent king in the proceeding

busty bernice was on duty as usual friday giving 
callers a telephonic tour of the lingerie corner the us supreme 
court said it was ok 
the young womans discussion of explicit sex acts on a recorded 
line was part of a multibilliondollar industry one that the 
nations highest court ruled has the constitutional right to do 
business under some restrictions 
its fantastic gloria leonard publisher of high society 
magazine and one of the leading dialaporn entrepreneurs said of 
the ruling we feel very triumphant it really is a victory for 
the first amendment 
ms leonard opened her adult telephone service in 1983 when 
the newly brokenup telephone companies first offered dialup 
information services to independent operators callers pay the fee 
usually a few dollars on their phone bill in exchange they can 
hear bernice and her counterparts pant 
i know it started in 1983 because thats when the complaints 
started coming in said diane killory general counsel of the 
federal communications commission the problem curious children 
were calling the numbers umpteen times racking up 
thousanddollarplus phone bills 
parents were not amused neither were organizations such as the 
childrens legal campaign in phoenix which has been mounting 
lobbying and legal campaigns to have dialaporn banned as a 
corrupting influence on minors 
theres no way to discriminate between adults and children in 
the listening audience said len munsil the campaigns chief 
lawyer and its quite clear that these messages are harmful to 
children 
in arguing her case ms leonard cites first amendment 
protections of free speech and she points to dialaporns enormous 
financial success as evidence that it meets community standards of 
acceptability 
at its peak a number of years ago we were getting half a 
million calls a day she saidthe number of willing customers 
for these services is testimonial that its a national standard 
while her business is off dramatically down to perhaps 5000 
calls a day ms leonard said she maintained that is because of a 
proliferation of competitors across the country not any diminution 
of interest in sex talk 
there are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in every 
city she said this stuff has really taken off on a 
momandpop basis however a source in the justice department 
who spoke on condition he not be identified said many of the 
dialaporn services appear to have corporate links 
whoever runs them the opportunity for profit is enormous 
overhead is low all thats required is a contract with the phone 
company for an information service number a switchboard capable of 
handling many calls at once and women and men willing to be 
recorded making suggestive words and noises some of the services 
provide live telephone contacts 
while precise figures havent been compiled court records say 
180 million dialaporn calls were placed in new york in 1984 
california has 204 separate dialaporn services making up 25 
percent of its information service numbers nationwide the industry 
did an estimated 2 billion in business last year 
efforts to reduce that business reach to its beginnings congress 
asked the fcc to look into restricting dialaporn in 1983 and last 
year the federal lawmakers decided to ban the services outright 
the supreme court ruling upholds the ban on obscene phone 
messages but rejects the ban on messages that are only indecent 
there can be lesser restrictions on indecent calls and ms 
killory said the fcc likely will revive an earlier plan to require 
access codes scrambled messages or credit card payment for 
dialaporn the idea is that children lacking the codes 
unscramblers or credit cards could not make the calls 
other steps are possible since the numbers begin with the same 
threedigit exchange pacific bell in california can cut off access 
to customers who request it and 800000 have done so and the ban 
on obscene calls remains in effect though the difference between 
obscenity and indecency can be a difficult one to draw 
many many of these mesages are obscene said munsil the 
porn line opponent how do you decide which well find out pretty 
soon when the justice department starts enforcing the law

police destroyed 10 drug laboratories 
that were turning out 22000 pounds of cocaine weekly the national 
police reported friday 
the raids this week were the latest in the most sustained 
antidrug campaign ever undertaken by colombian police 
it began five months ago after a new national police commander 
was named replacing a general who has been indicted in a 
drugtrafficking case 
a police communique said about 70 policemen using five 
helicopters carried out the raids as part of operation rainbow it 
said there was a gun battle at one of the labs and two of the lab 
guards were killed it did not mention police casualties 
the communique said the police destroyed 207000 gallons of 
ether acetone and other chemicals used to process cocaine 
a source who accompanied the police told the associated press 
that some of the ether was in drums identified as latex that had

president bush declared friday that three young 
civil rights workers killed 25 years ago by ku klux klansmen were 
heroes but he declined to promise their survivors he would work 
to reverse the effects of recent supreme court rulings on civil 
rights 
bush met at the white house with the family members of michael 
schwerner and andrew goodman both white new yorkers and james 
chaney a black mississippian whose lives were the subject of a 
fictionalized account in last years academy awardwinning movie 
mississippi burning 
the families were on a commemorative visit to the capital 
including an afternoon rally at the capitol to mark the 25th 
anniversary of the disappearance of the three young men 
in a statement released by spokesman marlin fitzwater bush 
lauded the accomplishments of chaney goodman and schwerner saying 
they gave their lives in the struggle to guarantee one of 
democracys most basic civil rights the right to votefor all 
americans 
we can erect no greater monument to their memory than to ensure 
that the arrogance and bigotry that took their lives never again 
exists in america bush added 
but rita schwernerbender who was married to schwerner told 
reporters she was disappointed bush did not commit himself when they 
asked him to back bipartisan legislation to deal with the supreme 
court cases that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country 
the court has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates for 
recent rulings that have chipped away at affirmative action and make 
it harder to win racial discrimination cases against employers 
that criticism was renewed friday at the rally 
this present majority on the supreme court is far more 
dangerous than bull connor with a fire hose benjamin hooks 
executive director of the naacp said he was referring to the 
birmingham ala sheriffs action against civil rights 
demonstrators 
but bush was noncommittal friday on the legislation the family 
members sought telling them he is waiting for a justice department 
to complete a review of the new supreme court rulings said 
fitzwater 
the visitors also brought up the problems such as housing 
education and medical needs as an extension of the civil rights 
struggle in the meeting characterized by fitzwater as a classic 
liberal vs conservative discussion bush told them the federal 
government could not solve everything without participation from 
other sectors of society as well 
i think he believes that a group of volunteers will solve the 
problem i dont mrs schwernerbender said referring to bushs 
call for volunteerism 
she added that she asked the president if he envisioned inviting 
a homeless family to live in his kennebunkport maine home to help 
solve the housing problem and he replied negatively 
bush also did not express a position on their request for support 
of universal and sameday voter registration and elimination of 
such practices as frequent purging of voter rolls 
the bush administration has not taken a postion on any 
legislative proposals regarding reforming voter registration except 
to oppose one by sen wendell ford dky 
that measure would allow voter registration by mail with drivers 
license applications said deborah burstionwade deputy director of 
public affairs for the justice department 
the president has not voiced any personal sentiments on the 
various proposals the white house said 
another participant julian chaney sister of the slain activist 
said she was not disappointed to get no commitment because i did 
not expect any commitment 
carolyn goodman mother of andrew goodman was less critical of 
the president she said he seemed in accord and we hope that he 
follows through but she and others said he gave them no specific 
commitments 
the families were on a bus caravan from philadelphia miss 
where the three were killed to washington and new york to 
commemorate the june 21 1964 disappearance of the men they had 
been conducting a black voter registration drive in neshoba county 
their bulletriddled bodies were found buried in an earthen dam 
near philadelphia miss and the fbi found that the ku klux klan 
had killed them 
mississippis attorney general mike moore is considering 
reopening the case in which murder charges against 19 whites 
initially were dropped in state court the suspects most of whom 
are still alive were tried in federal court seven were convicted 
of violating civil rights law another defendant pleaded guilty 
eight were acquitted and the cases against three others ended in 
mistrials 
the most time any spent in prison was six years

iran and the soviet union ended nearly a decade of 
icy relations on friday by signing a longterm cooperation pact at 
the end of a visit by irans parliament speaker with possibly an 
arms deal to follow 
a communique issued at the end of speaker hashemi rafsanjanis 
fourday visit including two days of talks with president mikhail 
s gorbachev said the two sides agreed to build and develop good 
neighborly relations on the principles of equality 
rafsanjani who is also the acting commander of irans armed 
forces is the highest ranking iranian official to visit moscow 
since the 1979 revolution that crushed the iranian communist party 
and sent mobs into the streets shouting death to america death to 
russia 
he went to moscow barely three weeks after the death of irans 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini while his 
countrys official 40day mourning period is still in effect 
fridays communique according to the official soviet news agency 
tass said moscow and tehran will develop economic scientific 
technological and commercial relations as well as cooperation in 
other fields such as medical services and student and lecturer 
exchanges on a longterm basis 
rafsanjani and gorbachev also signed a declaration pledging to 
foster contacts between soviet religious leaders and those of iran 
the declaration promised soviet cooperation in strengthening 
the defense capacity of its southern neighbor indicating that the 
kremlin planned to sell weapons to iran 
the soviet union was iraqs major arms supplier during the 
eightyear iraniraq war a factor that contributed to the strain in 
relations with iran 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted rafsanjani as 
saying at tehran airport upon his return home our negotiations 
spanned many fields including cooperation in the economic 
commercial and cultural sectors as well as in the international 
arena 
rafsanjani originally due to return home thursday extended his 
visit by one day to visit the azerbaijani capital of baku described 
by tehran radio as a moslem city 
during a state dinner wednesday he invited gorbachev to visit 
iran if gorbachev accepts he would be the first leader of a major 
power to visit tehran since the revolution 
gorbachev and khomeini exchanged messages last february and 
their foreign ministers then met four times paving the way for 
rafsanjanis visit 
rafsanjani received redcarpet treatment throughout the trip he 
said thursday after his meetings with gorbachev the optimism we 
had before the meetings has been totally justified 
on friday iranian media quoted him as saying the enthusiasm 
shown by the soviet people toward us especially by the moslems was 
beyond imagination such receptions in moscow leningrad and 
particularly in baku were very frank and sincere 
tehran television said bakus moslems thronged to receive the 
iranian delegation it said most were dressed in black in mourning 
for khomeinis death 
tehran radio tehran tv and irna all were monitored in cyprus 
rafsanjani an advocate of ending irans isolation and building 
closer ties abroad disclosed this month that days before his death 
khomeini advised better relations with the soviet union 
iranian chief justice musavi ardebili said friday that iran will 
not be swayed by us threats about its developing relationship 
with the soviet union tehran radio reported 
the united states has expressed concern about warming relations 
between tehran and moscow and soviet willingness to sell arms to 
iran 
us secretary of state james baker iii told the house foreign 
affairs committee the administration is concerned about the 
possibility of weapons transfers 
antiamericanism has been a major plank in iranian policy since 
the islamic revolution overthrew the shah and brought khomeini to 
power 
relations with moscow improved strongly recently as iran sought 
to rebuild its economy after the devastation of the iraniraq war 
the war was halted last august by a unsponsored ceasefire

maintenance crews working ahead of schedule 
gave motorists on a 21mile stretch of the florida turnpike a 
temporary head start on an increase in the speed limit 
the state has approved increasing the speed limit from 55 mph to 
65 mph on 330 miles of highways and it becomes effective june 29 
but when crews were notified of the change they got right on the 
job and put up the new 65 mph signs unfortunately it was 10 days 
too early 
the state requires that law enforcement agencies be given 14 days 
notice of any change in speed limit so the 65 mph signs started 
coming down thursday morning 
the mixup meant that drivers heading from jupiter to boca raton 
between monday and thursday traveled 65 mph with impunity but could 
have been pulled over for going 56 mph by noon thursday 
the highway patrol said it was unlikely drivers would be given 
tickets because of the confusion 
let me put it to you this way said lt jim howell district 
commander of the florida highway patrols turnpike substation 
were going to use the utmost in discretion

pines and tall grass obscure a 28ton 
welcome to minnesota marker to the point where few people are 
being welcomed by it and officials want it moved 
the hard part is finding someone wholl undertake the task for a 
less than monumental fee 
the marker in this southeastern minnesota town is one of 20 such 
monuments around the state minnesota transportation officials want 
to move it one mile from where it was built in 1941 
tourism officials forwarded the idea of moving the weighty 
monument to the transportation department which decided to seek 
bids for the project 
after one round failed to attract any bidders the agency 
contacted 50 building movers directly and received one bid which 
was about five times what we expected said craig churchward 
project landscape architect for the department 
the department already has designed the new signs that will hang 
from 11 of the 20 monuments they will read welcome to minnesota 
on one side while the other will show pine trees and a canoeist and 
the words visit again 
the monuments are unique because each was built with local stone 
by federal works progress administration laborers in the 1930s and 
early 1940s the monuments generally mark secondary entrances to the 
state churchward said

solidaritys newly elected legislators held 
an organizational meeting friday but postponed a decision on the 
issue of gen wojciech jaruzelskis expected bid to be president 
during the sixhour meeting at warsaw university the new senators 
and deputies chose bronislaw geremek to be chairman of the citizens 
parliamentary club the organization of solidarity legislators 
geremek a close adviser to solidarity leader lech walesa was 
elected to the sejm or parliament 
solidarity candidates scored overwhelming victories in the june 4 
election and june 18 runoff against jaruzelskis communists 
senatorelect andrzej wielowieyski will be geremeks deputy said 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
solidarity candidates won 99 of the 100 seats in the newly 
created senate and all of the 161 seats open to the opposition in 
the 460member sejm the remaining sejm seats were reserved for the 
governing communists and their allies 
the senate and sejm will meet together as the national assembly 
at the end of next week or in early july to elect polands first 
president in 37 years 
the communist party is expected to nominate jaruzelski its first 
secretary he imposed martial law in december 1981 and used it to 
crush solidarity which had been chartered in the fall of 1980 as 
the first free union movement in the soviet bloc 
solidarity was legalized again under an agreement reached in 
april by solidarity and communist auhtorities that also provided for 
the freest elections in poland in more than four decades 
onyszkiewicz told a news conference a decision has not been made 
on the presidency 
but the debate indicates that we will not propose our own 
candidate and we will accept the formula that senators and members 
of parliament will vote according to the wishes of the electorate as 
expressed during electoral meetings he said 
he did not elaborate but apparently meant most solidarity 
legislators would abstain or vote against jaruzelskis candidacy 
he noted that the polish united workers party the official title 
of the communist party has not formally nominated jaruzelski and 
said there is no reason for the opposition to take an immediate 
stand 
the communists are expected to nominate jaruzelski at a central 
committee meeting wednesday 
solidarity will have 260 members in the national assembly and the 
communistled coalition 300 so the communists can elect jaruzelski 
he has proposed a grand coalition with solidarity but 
onyszkiewicz said the debate rather indicates that we will not 
accept the offer to form a government with the communist 
coalition 
solidarity leaders previously rejected jaruzelskis offer but 
said legislative cooperation is possible 
a strong presidency is being restored to poland for the first 
time since 1952 the president will serve for six years be 
responsible for defense and foreign relations and have limited 
powers to dissolve parliament and declare states of emergency

jose eduardo dos santos and jonas 
malheiro savimbi whose handshake could mark the beginning of peace 
in angolas 14year civil war are both strong leaders one is known 
for his flamboyant rhetoric the other is lowkeyed and pragmatic 
rebel leader savimbis colorful style is matched by a 
checkerboard of alliances with south africa the united states and 
china 
he looks equally at home in wellpressed battle fatigues at 
unitas bush headquarters in jamba southern angola or in a slick 
mao suit in washington 
in public the soviettrained dos santos angolas president is 
cast in the role of reluctant statesman he is sober reserved and 
insistent that angolas future lies in oneparty rule by the popular 
movement for the liberation of angola known as mpla 
savimbi was born in 1934 in munhango central angola son of a 
benguela railroad employee who was also a parttime protestant 
preacher 
he stepped into the limelight as the 20yearold general 
secretary of the angolan peoples union the southern african 
nations first liberation movement that carried out random attacks 
against portuguese colonialists and angolan civilians 
a member of the mpla in 1962 savimbi was nominated foreign 
minister of angolas governmentinexile 
he resigned and studied for two years at lausanne university 
switzerland before founding unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola in 1966 and receiving military training in 
china 
in september 1975 unita split with angolas threeparty

sen orrin hatch on friday unveiled an 8 
billion package of financial incentives to small employers and 
increased government spending in a bid to provide healthcare 
coverage for most of the estimated 37 million americans who have 
none 
the utah republican with the support of several business groups 
offered his measure as an alternative to the 23 billion universal 
health care plan advocated by sen edward m kennedy dmass 
his bill simply treats the symptoms not the real disease 
rising health care costs hatch said of the kennedy plan which 
hatch predicted could ultimately cost 100 billion or more 
hatch said he believed cost savings would more than pay for his 
plan but he said he would seek new revenue to pay for the government 
part of it if necessary 
kennedys plan would require most employers to provide health 
insurance and have the government step in to cover the unemployed 
hatchs would seek to control health care costs and offer tax and 
other financial incentives designed to make insurance more 
affordable to small business it also calls for expansion of 
medicaid coverage to more than 12 million uninsured poor 
kennedy in a statement said hatchs proposal included many 
worthwhile ideas but would cost taxpayers more than his plan in 
my view businesses that refuse to insure their workers are part of 
the problem and should be required to share in the solution 
senator hatch would give them a free ride and taxpayers would have 
to pay too much 
hatchs proposal was endorsed by the chamber of commerce the 
national association of manufacturers and other business and 
insurance groups 
our health care system needs to be pushed and shoved so that it 
works better in providing health care for all americans hatch 
said affordable health care gives us greater access to health 
care 
the introduction of the hatch proposal came amid growing 
complaints about healthcare costs from business and other interests 
which have long opposed efforts by kennedy and others to mandate 
health benefits 
although they still oppose kennedys approach a number of major 
corporations and business and healthcare industry leaders this year 
have asked congress for help in controlling costs 
major elements of the hatch proposal include 
eliminating state mandates on what coverage must be provided in 
health insurance which hatch said would allow small employers to 
develop lower cost plans 
expanding at a 1 billion cost to the government from 25 
percent to 100 percent the tax deduction for health insurance 
premiums for the selfemployed the provision also would allow small 
businesses with no federal tax liability to recoup onethird of the 
cost of providing health care to their employees 
providing 10 million in grants to help states develop insurance 
programs to provide coverage to those who cannot obtain insurance 
amending antitrust laws to allow small businesses to pool health 
insurance for their workers 
spending 50 million to improve coordination of and boost 
funding for state and federal programs providing prenatal care to 
lowincome women 
spending 100 million in grants to states for programs to 
prevent accidents improve emergency medical services systems and 
pay health care providers for uncompensated services they provide to 
accident victims 
granting the department of health and human services authority 
to establish treatment guidelines designed to reduce malpractice 
claims by providing a defense for such litigation

nasr is believed to be a palestinian released from an israeli 
jail in a 1985 prisoner swap palestinians in gaza say he is not 
known to be affiliated with any political faction 
the affiliation of the abductors remained unknown the israeli 
army blamed terrorists linked to the plo the palestine 
liberation organization denied involvement 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said a note in 
arabic attributed the incident to the palestinian popular army 
about which the united states has no information 
in the 13page letter to bush the captors said they kidnapped 
george to draw world attention particularly american to 
palestinians plight 
i appeal to you in my name and the name of my comrades and all 
my comrades in jail and all palestinians to do your best to deal 
seriously and effectively with the palestinian cause 
why dont you do your duty and receive the head of our state 
mr yasser arafat in your office the letter said 
us embassy spokesman len lefko said he was not aware of any 
conditions for georges release 
george was seized about 1130 am thursday when he was lured 
from his gaza city office he was freed at a un hostel on gaza 
city beach then taken to the marne house by us embassy officials 
ann nixon codirector of save the children in the occupied 
territories said george immediately called his wife elizabeth 
webb the couple have two daughters 
he said he was very well treated and thought his family 
probably suffered more than he did ms nixon said 
george was the first foreigner kidnapped since israel captured 
the gaza strip and west bank in the 1967 middle east war 
the territories have been torn by a palestinian revolt against 
israeli rule for the past 18 months and more than 520 palestinians 
have been killed 
during the uprising the plobacked underground has maintained a 
policy exempting foreigners from attacks 
in tunis plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman denounced the 
abduction he said earlier that the plo was making the greatest 
effort to secure georges release 
arab reports said at least two handwritten communiques from 
george were passed to the red cross during his captivity outlining 
demands for the release of palestinian prisoners 
the reports said george wrote that he was taken by five men armed 
with a machine gun and grenades israeli officials said he may have 
known the man who lured him from his office 
a palestinian journalist shown one of georges letters said it 
was written in english and addressed to us ambassador william 
brown and bush 
in the letter george said his captors were demanding israel 
release seven senior palestinian activists including sheikh ahmed 
yassin spiritual leader of the hamas fundamentalist movement and 
three members of plo factions 
george is fluent in arabic and has worked in the middle east many 
years he was with the peace corps in oman more than a decade ago 
and worked in the palestinian refugee camp of ein hilweh in lebanon 
with save the children before moving to israel in january 1986 
he left lebanon after kidnappings by moslem radicals made it 
dangerous for westerners 
the kidnapping was condemned by several palestinian organizations 
in israel including leaders of six palestinian workers and womens 
groups 
the ugly crime is not linked to the palestinian people their 
statement said it is aimed at hurting our people our intefadeh 
uprising and our leadership the plo

a grenade hurled into a crowded 
downtown market friday killed two people and wounded 56 police and 
doctors reported 
no group asserted responsibility for the attack which police 
said could have had only one objective killing and maiming vendors 
and shoppers mostly women and children 
one person was killed instantly and the other died at rosales 
hospital according to dr manuel angulo chief of emergency 
services at the hospital 
he said five of the wounded were in critical condition 
i heard a tremendous blast and came running said onion 
seller rit estela alas 32 people were lying on the ground 
clutching themselves and crying one young boys face was 
destroyed 
her stand is about 30 feet from where the grenade exploded at a 
shacklike structure that sold cheap lunches and snacks of 
cheesefilled tortillas 
halfeaten tortillas and pieces of pineapple and mango were 
scattered among puddles of blood 
ms alas and market security guard salvador hernandez said they 
helped rush about 20 people to the hospital 
we stopped four or five pickups and loaded in the most 
seriously wounded said hernandez his jeans and tshirt stained 
with blood 
two police experts said the explosive device apparently was a 
grenade thrown by hand and not fired by a launcher 
the attack came after armed forces and leftist rebels reported a 
surge in combat that left dozens of fighters killed or wounded 
the armed forces press committee said government troops killed 23 
insurgents and wounded 13 others in fighting thursday and early 
friday and that seven soldiers were killed and four wounded 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front announced 
a regional offensive in northern chalatenango province on the 
clandestine radio they said they killed or wounded 38 soldiers in 
13 clashes thursday and early friday 
the heaviest fighting appeared to be in and around la palma 50 
miles north of san salvador where the rebels claimed to have killed 
13 soldiers and the government claimed to have killed 14 insurgents 
both sides routinely exaggerate enemy casualties and it usually is 
impossible to confirm their figures 
about 70000 people mostly civilians have been slain in the 
9year civil war president alfredo cristiani who took office june 
1 plans legislation giving police armed forces and courts more 
power against suspected subversives opposition political and union 
organizations and human rights groups say the proposed laws are 
draconian 
the new administration on friday tied its proposed legislation to 
wednesdays shooting of american nun mary mackey 72 
this deed violates human rights and once again demonstrates 
that the terrorist delinquency has reached a point that obliges the 
government to adopt urgent laws to protect peoples lives and 
property said a government communique 
but it said preliminary investigations indicate common 
criminals were responsible for the shooting at a vehicle in which 
three nuns were traveling the two other women were not injured 
sister mackey was conscious friday when she left on an ambulance 
plane for houston texas according to the rev ken myers 
myers her priest and director of the orphanage where she worked 
said the nun will lose the sight in her left eye

canada on friday began the oneyear countdown to 
the deadline for approval of a constitutional agreement that would 
recognize quebec as a distinct society 
prime minister brian mulroney calls the meech lake accord 
critical to national unity but the proposal is off to a rocky start 
two of canadas 10 provinces have yet to ratify the accord and 
there have been threats to reconsider it elsewhere 
one year from today the meech lake constitutional accord 
either lives or dies and some of the major players in the drama are 
already betraying hints of the exasperation they feel the toronto 
newspaper the globe and mail said friday 
canada gained independence in 1867 but british jurisdiction over 
the constitution did not formally end until april 17 1982 when 
queen elizabeth ii proclaimed the new constitution act 
but quebec where 80 percent of the population speaks french 
refused to join the nine other provinces in signing the national 
constitution 
officials feared that quebecs legal and social traditions 
established by the regions french founders and unique among the 
provinces would not be protected from tampering by the federal 
government 
seven years later in april 1987 mulroney and the 10 provincial 
premiers reached an agreement in principle at meech lake quebec 
that would recognize those distinctions and bring the province into 
the constitutional fold 
quebec was the first province to ratify the accord on june 22 
1987 at that time a threeyear deadline for full ratification 
began the federal parliament approved the accord last year but 
ratification is still needed by two provinces new brunswick and 
manitoba 
a new provincial government in newfoundland has been threatening 
to rescind approval by a previous government 
the constitution applies to quebec even though it has not signed 
the document but the refusal makes it more difficult to consider 
national policy changes on issues such as how the senate operates 
although the meech lake accord has become a major issue in 
canadian political circles and is a frequent topic for national news 
media the public remains largely indifferent 
a gallup poll published thursday in the toronto star found that 
30 percent of canadians believe the meech lake accord is good for 
the country 31 percent believe it isnt good and 40 percent dont 
know 
in january 31 percent said it was good 18 percent said it 
wasnt and 52 percent didnt know 
opponents charge that recognizing a distinct society within 
canada could weaken the national charter of rights and they say the 
provinces would be given too much power englishspeaking provinces 
especially those in western canada traditionally have been wary of 
quebec 
the people here generally are questioning the distinct society 
provision premier william vander zalm of british columbia told 
the canadian press news agency thursday in an indication his support 
for the accord could be wavering as well theyre worried about 
it becoming afraid

cardinal timothy manning who strived to unify 
a divided archdiocese by reaching out to other faiths and minorities 
during his 15 years as roman catholic archbishop of los angeles 
died of cancer friday he was 79 
manning died at the norris cancer hospital of the university of 
southern california said aj antczak managing editor of the 
tidings the archdiocese newspaper 
ordained a priest in 1934 he retired in 1985 as archbishop 
manning observed the 55th anniversary of his ordination as priest 
last week 
former president ronald reagan said in a statement the archbishop 
was a man of great strength courage and compassion 
he enriched the life of thousands who are better because of his 
good work reagan said 
mayor tom bradley ordered flags at city buildings flown at 
halfstaff in honor of manning 
cardinal manning eased the turmoil and transition from pre to 
postvatican council times for catholics in the los angeles area 
bradley said he helped them through a most difficult period and 
for that he will be remembered 
manning took over the archbishops chair in 1970 from cardinal 
james francis mcintyre whose final years were filled with rancor as 
minority catholics protested weekly in front of st basils catholic 
church saying they were being alienated from their own church 
manning worked quickly to soothe angered feelings and reconcile the 
church with disenfranchised groups 
the most pressing problem the first responsibility i could 
see was toward the priest of the diocese he said in an interview 
18 months after he succeeded mcintyre the whole wellbeing of the 
community depends on the priests on their unity and on their 
holiness my first reaction was to make it known that i was here to 
listen 
the new archbishop established ministries for blacks and 
hispanics and began a priests senate to give the clergy greater say 
in the business of the archdiocese an interparochial council 
extended the participation to the parish level 
in 1975 he established vicars for the spanish speaking and black 
communities and for the orange and santa barbaraventura counties 
manning also visited local protestant and jewish congregations 
during the vietnam war he ensured young catholic men knew about 
their right to declare themselves conscientious objectors 
he spoke out against the nuclear arms race calling it in 1980 a 
dance of death and in 1981 declared the cry of the poor for 
bread has been answered by warheads 
he petitioned thensecretary of state george shultz in 1983 to 
halt the deportation of salvadoran refugees 
his social liberalism was matched by a theological conservatism 
he declared abortion was murder and said shortly after he was made 
archbishop that any catholic who cooperates in an abortion was 
excommunicated from the church 
even the mother herself is not immune from this severe 
censure he said he also remained firm on several other points of 
church law such as birth control that some american catholics have 
generally disregarded 
manning a native of ballingeary county cork ireland answered 
a call for priests in america by coming in 1928 to st patricks 
seminary in menlo park calif 
after ordination in 1934 he went to rome for postgraduate 
studies at the gregorian institute and received the degree of doctor 
of canon law in 1938 he returned to los angeles and was appointed 
secretary to archbishop john j cantwell 
he was named an auxiliary bishop in 1946 and consecrated a full 
bishop the same year two years later he was made chancellor of the 
los angeles archdiocese in 1955 he was made vicar general and in 
1967 was appointed bishop of fresno 
in 1973 pope paul vi elevated manning to the college of 
cardinals manning served six popes 
a mass for christian burial will be said wednesday morning and a 
rosary will be said that night 
more than 100 bishops nationwide and in europe were expected to 
gather thursday morning for another mass of christian burial and 
burial will follow

say where 
one student said the couple did not come here by train or plane 
but refused to give any details there are many ways to leave 
china he said 
yan was a leader of the beijing independent intellectuals 
association and faced certain arrest and possible death in china 
the organization was formed in may to support the campaign for more 
democracy it and other independent organizations were banned with 
the imposition of martial law in beijing on may 20 
yan and thousands of other dissidents went into hiding when 
communist authorities sent troops into beijing on june 3 to crush

a joint declaration that could lead to closer 
cooperation between roman catholics and anglicans is expected when 
pope john paul ii and archbishop of canterbury robert runcie meet in 
rome this fall a church of england official said friday 
the rev christopher hill said they will discuss the mission and 
potential unity of their churches and not allow the vexed question 
of women priests and bishops strongly opposed by the vatican to 
dominate their talks 
hill runcies secretary for ecumenical affairs briefed 
journalists at runcies lambeth palace residence on the archbishops 
fourday visit to rome sept 29oct 2 
the pope leads about 650 million catholics and the archbishop 
spiritual head of the state church of england leads the worlds 70 
million anglicans 
hill said runcies party will include the archbishop of nigeria 
joseph adetiloye 
adetiloyes presence makes the point visible that it is the 
worldwide anglican communion at the talks hill added 
runcies visit will be only the fourth to the vatican by an 
archbishop of canterbury since the 16thcentury reformation but 
runcie has had four meetings elsewhere with john paul 
when the visit was announced in march runcies office said 
church unity would top the agenda it stressed that the visit was 
planned before the election and consecration in february of the rt 
rev barbara harris as the first anglican woman bishop by the us 
episcopalians boston diocese 
opponents of women priests and bishops said the consecration made 
catholicanglican unity impossible and threatened to split the 
worlds 27 selfgoverning anglican churches 
there are now women priests in six anglican churches the us 
episcopal church canada new zealand uganda kenya and brazil the 
other 21 churches including the church of england still refuse to 
admit women to the priesthood although some including england are 
moving toward doing so 
the pope wrote runcie in december that ordaining women priests 
and recognizing the right to proceed to women bishops appeared to 
preempt nearly 30 years of catholicanglican dialogue on unity and 
effectively block the path to mutual recognition of each others 
clergy 
hill said the joint declaration from the rome meeting is likely 
to encourage closer coperation between catholics and anglicans in 
spreading the christian gospel particularly in africa where the two 
churches are both seeing their greatest growth 
previous visits to the vatican of archbishops of canterbury were 
by geoffrey fisher in 1960 meeting pope john xxiii michael ramsey 
to pope paul vi in 1966 and by donald coggan also with paul vi in 
1977 
john paul and runcie are expected to worship together in the 
church of st gregory the great which stands on the site of a 
monastery where pope gregory i in 596 gave his blessing to augustine 
and 40 other monks setting out to convert england to christianity 
during the reformation king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 
to set up the english church when pope clement vii refused him a 
divorce from catherine of aragon

uneasy members of congress from sugarproducing 
states said friday they were waiting for proposals from the bush 
administration to change us sugar import quotas now labeled an 
official violation of international trade agreements in a ruling 
accepted by the administration 
sen spark matsunaga dhawaii noted that us trade 
representative carla a hills had maintained there should be no 
unilateral disarmament by the united states on sugar and added 
i aim to hold her to this position 
in an earlier statement thursday mrs hills said 
we have an obligation under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade to administer the program consistent with international 
trade rules and we are confident we can do so we have ample time to 
consider our options and will be consulting closely with the 
industry and the congress 
the quotas which vary from time to time reduced us imports of 
sugar from 11 billion worth in 1982 to 400 million last year 
the statements followed a meeting in geneva on thursday where the 
us representative joined delegates from 95 other governments in 
the gatt council to accept the report of an international panel that 
ruled against the united states the panel consisted of poland 
uruguay and hong kong under rules of the agreement any single 
member can block acceptance of a report 
the united states has formally accused japan india and brazil of 
unfair trading practices singling them out for early negotiations 
to reduce barriers and could have been embarrassed had it resisted 
the panel report 
rep arlan stangeland rminn who represents the countrys 
biggest sugar beet district said hills had not yet told members of 
congress what the us options are 
i think we should fight a little harder and defend the law 
he said in an interview 
he said australia which brought the original complaint before 
the gatt council protects its sugar growers with a high tariff that 
the united states cannot duplicate the 12 governments of the 
european community subsidize their exports and the united states 
could do that he added 
thomas hammer president of the sweetener users association said 
the us government should increase its imports and lower its price 
for sugar which is twice the world price 
the bitter irony is that american consumers are forced to pay 
3 billion a year to finance a program that violates international 
trade laws he said in a statement 
the us countrybycountry quotas are set so that the government 
does not have to lay out any money to buy up sugar surpluses from 
domestic producers the limitation on supply keeps prices high 
about 22 cents a pound to farmers currently compared with a world 
price of about 11 cents

los alamos national laboratory researchers 
have discovered tritium a byproduct of nuclear fusion in 
duplicating the university of utahs purported breakthrough in 
producing cold fusion 
edmund k storms a staff member of the department of energys 
new mexico lab said he and another researcher carol talcott found 
tritium in significant amounts 4000 counts per milliliter in 
two cells the deseret news reported friday 
on march 23 utah chemist b stanley pons and a british 
colleague martin fleischmann announced they had sustained a 
nuclear fusion reaction immersing rods of paladium inside platinum 
coils in deuteriumrich heavy water 
the two researchers said the experiment produced up to 100 times 
the energy needed to produce the reaction 
tritium can only be produced through a fusion reaction said 
storms who began his experiments shortly after pons and fleischmann 
made their announcement three months ago 
we are trying now to understand really what environment must 
exist in the electrodes to allow this to happen storms said 
about a dozen labs around the world have reported finding tritium 
in their fusion experiments but los alamos is the first government 
laboratory to do so 
the news was met with jubilation by another fusion researcher 
this result is of fantastic importance because tritium 
absolutely proves fusion if you get tritium there is fusion 
occurring said john o bockris a professor of chemistry at texas 
aampm university 
three labs at texas aampm have duplicated major aspects of the 
ponsfleischmann experiments including small amounts of excess 
heat in one lab researchers have seen the neutrons and large 
amounts of tritium 
this los alamos result which confirms ours precisely is of 
immense worldinfluencing importance bockris said its the 
greatest news we have had since the 23rd of march 
bockris is convinced that the los alamos confirmation will 
soothe the controversy that has raged in scientific circles since 
the ponsfleischmann announcement the experiment has been generally 
derided by physicists who contended utah may have achieved an 
unknown chemical reaction but not fusion 
a spokesman at los alamos also was cautious 
the marvelous thing about science is the checks and balances 
that now will enter the picture this work must not only be 
reproduced and confirmed but also peer reviewed and published 
said jeff schwartz 
and quite frankly we are unable to say if the research will 
indeed withstand the scrutiny of the historic traditional process 
but as an institution our credibility demands that the process go 
forth we all agree on that he added 
storms acknowledges that while he is optimistic about his 
findings he hasnt solved the mysteries behind cold nuclear fusion 
we are presently trying to reproduce that phenomenon but so 
far have been unsuccessful storms said it the tritium gives 
us some optimism but until we are able to reproduce it we are 
really not much further ahead 
los alamos is currently collaborating with texas aampm and brigham 
young university

a federal appeals court friday overturned the 
racketeering convictions of gov buddy roemers father and reputed 
mobster carlos marcello 
charles e roemer ii commissioner of administration under former 
gov edwin edwards and marcello were convicted in 1981 of 
conspiracy to violate federal racketeering laws in a sting operation 
aimed at bribing state officials 
roemer served 15 months of a threeyear prison term marcello 
given a sevenyear sentence and facing a 10year term for trying to 
bribe a federal judge in los angeles remains in prison three 
others were acquitted after an 18week trial 
a threejudge panel of the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
which initially upheld the convictions in 1981 ruled unanimously 
friday that the convictions could no longer stand because the law 
the men allegedly violated conspiracy to commit mail fraud later 
was altered by the us supreme court 
roemer 67 said from his home in baton rouge that the experience 
was personally devastating 
what did it cost me does that count the heart attack and the 
health problems that were the result of that does it count what my 
children and 17 grandchildren went through and my wife i was worth 
12 million or 15 million and i took bankruptcy 
four million dollars went in expense for the trial and 
preparation and i lost 10 years of my life what do you think it 
cost me 
roemers son gov buddy roemer fought back tears when a 
reporter told of the decision im very happy said the 
governor who stopped for a moment to regain his composure 
im sorry let me try again im real pleased and happy he 
the elder roemer has had a real hard time in many ways unfairly 
he took the bad times like a man 
marcello 79 and in poor health is at the federal correctional 
institution in rochester minn where assistant warden john chreno 
said marcello has been under constant physicians care 
in the sting undercover fbi agents posed as crooked insurance 
executives they were convicted of taking part in a scheme to win a 
multimilliondollar state group insurance contract through bribery 
the government said marcello and roemer believed they would split 
a commission of 87000 a month 
the prosecution alleged they conspired to deprive citizens of 
honest government this latest appeal was based on a supreme court 
opinion that the mail fraud law is designed to protect money or 
property rights not intangible rights such as the right to good 
government 
the record in this case inexorably leads to one conclusion the 
mail and wire fraud charges were tried as intangible right 
offenses the 5th circuit said 
the indictment charged a scheme to defraud citizens of honest 
government the prosecutor described it as such and the judge 
instructed the jury that it could convict upon finding the existence 
of a scheme as charged in the indictment 
the fbi had codenamed the operation brilab short for 
briberylabor 
im sure to mr marcello its a very significant event but to 
the government its purely academic at this stage said us 
attorney john volz who prosecuted both men both defendants have 
served their sentences from that case 
edwards who dropped his bid for a fourth term after finishing 
second to buddy roemer in the states open primary said he was 
glad for roemer but expressed outrage at volzs remark 
im very pleased because theres no doubt in my mind that this 
was a political prosecution to begin with said edwards reached 
at his home in baton rouge

the senate on friday passed legislation aimed 
at making desecration of the flag unlawful 
the aim of the amendment approved by voice vote without dissent 
is to circumvent the effect of a supreme court decision earlier in 
the week which held that destruction of the flag is protected by the 
first amendment guarantee of free speech 
im confident its constitutional sen joseph biden ddel 
chairman of the judiciary panel and a leading congressional liberal 
told his colleagues bidens measure was tacked onto an unrelated 
child care bill 
bidens measure which adds a new section to federal law dealing 
with defacing us property makes it a misdemeanor to burn trample 
on throw down or otherwise deface the flag 
biden did not explain how the provision could be constitional 
while similar provisions of existing federal law under the courts 
decision wednesday would not be there was no one in his office 
after the senate session and no answer at bidens home 
earlier house speaker thomas s foley said that while lawmakers 
are outraged by the high court decision of wednesday changing the 
constitution should be viewed with caution 
foley dwash said that nobody in the house supports flag 
burning everyone condemns it and believes that there is no 
justification for the burning and disrespect to the american flag 
but he said he would be extraordinarily slow to amend the first 
amendment to the constitution which is at the heart of our 
constitutional liberties and freedom 
about 10 lawmakers have already introduced constitutional 
amendments in the wake of the decision foley said but any such 
amendment should be the subject of lengthy hearings and discussion 
in congress he said 
it was possible the house would consider next week a resolution 
similar to the one passed by the senate this week expressing 
opposition to the view of the court 
rep henry hyde of illinois a senior republican on the house 
judiciary committee said he was exploring ways of getting around 
the decision without a constitutional amendment possibly by taking 
away from the supreme court jurisdiction over lawsuits on flag 
desecration 
i think the mood of the house is to do something effective and 
not just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag he 
said a new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment he 
said

china which played host to both president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev this year has slipped 
toward diplomatic isolation because of its repressive policies at 
home 
tiananmen square usually adorned with the flags of a parade of 
visiting dignitaries is ringed instead by martial law troops the 
only highlevel visit on the agenda is the foreign minister of sao 
tome and principe 
once the wests mostfavored socialist nation because of its 
capitaliststyle reforms and its independence from moscow china is 
almost universally shunned following the military attack on 
studentled demonstrators and subsequent mass arrests of protesters 
chinas diplomatic horizons appear similar to those of the 1960s 
when albania was its best friend and solidarity with third world 
revolutionaries its main purpose 
the united states has suspended military sales and contacts and 
canceled highlevel meetings canada has recalled its ambassador 
france and the netherlands have frozen diplomatic relations belgium 
has banned all official visits and new cooperative projects 
west germany has canceled a parliamentary visit and mexico has 
stopped a visit by its foreign minister because of the 
considerable violence 
britain has postponed talks on the return of hong kong to china 
in 1997 and a planned visit by prince charles and princess diana 
scheduled for the fall is on hold 
but the nations of southeast asia which see turmoil in their 
giant neighbor as a direct threat to their own stability have been 
noticeably sparing in their criticism 
philippine president corazon aquino expressed sadness over 
executions but conceded that the matter is within the domestic 
jurisdiction of chinas courts 
indonesia and malaysia say they have no intention of interfering 
in chinas internal affairs 
japan has halted highlevel contacts and suspended talks on 
economic assistance to china but publicly has expressed little more 
than sorrow and disappointment japans cautious approach stems 
partly from lingering sensitivities over the great suffering the 
japanese military caused china in world war ii 
nations that long have courted china are condemning it in 
language normally unheard of in cautious diplomatic circles 
australian prime minister bob hawke spoke of the repression and 
brutality of a government executing those involved in the popular 
uprisings french foreign minister roland dumas referred to the 
horror and veritable murders of chinas totalitarian 
machine 
even the justheld congress of the socialist international has 
voiced its outrage and gorbachev has warned that a halt in chinas 
reforms poses a danger to the whole world 
chinas response to the foreign criticism has been muted 
theyre being amazingly quiet said one asian diplomat i 
think theyll sit and wait and they honestly believe it will blow 
over in three months or so theyll start getting worried in two 
months if it doesnt blow over 
even in criticizing the united states for imposing sanctions the 
government has been careful to avoid a complete rupture the 
chinese side hopes to maintain and develop sinous relations a 
foreign ministry spokeswoman said 
but premier li peng in a meeting with a foreign ministry 
delegation from pakistan stressed that in times of difficulty it 
is very clear who are true friends 
li said those countries that try to exert diplomatic and economic 
pressures on china are shortsighted and unwise 
the premier was speaking from a 2000year tradition of 
insularity in which the middle kingdom thought it had little to gain 
and nothing to learn from contacts with the uncivilized nations 
beyond its borders 
through much of communist chinas 40year history the stress on 
economic selfsufficiency and the tendency toward xenophobia has 
been as strong as during any imperial dynasty 
since rising to power and inaugurating an open door policy a 
decade ago deng xiaoping has brought dramatic changes to chinas 
foreign relations 
in 1979 he ended three decades of mistrust by restoring 
relations with the united states wartime enemy japan is now the 
major source of development aid britain in 1984 agreed to return 
hong kong in 1997 in a model agreement on the peaceful transfer of 
territory 
in recent years deng has revived moribund relations with eastern 
europe built solid ties with thailand and other asian nations 
ended years of hostility with india started trade ties with 
anticommunist south korea and even coaxed taiwan into more 
unofficial contacts 
in may gorbachev came to beijing for the first sinosoviet 
summit in 30 years a triumph for deng marred by the occupation of 
tiananmen square by thousands of prodemocracy students 
despite some tough words government spokesman yuan mu said 
chinese are not spineless people and we are not afraid of 
condemnation or sanction china cannot revert to its former 
isolation 
the sharp drop in outside contacts is already taking its toll 
one european diplomat said the line of propaganda tries to put 
out that everything is normal he said but at the working level 
these measures will not go unnoticed 
china badly needs foreign technology financial assistance and 
tourism for its modernization drive and its leaders have repeatedly 
stressed that the open door policy should not be affected by the 
domestic turmoil 
what is important is that we should never change china into a 
closed country deng said in a june 9 speech that is being studied 
nationwide as the final word on government policy 
in the 150 years since the opium war china has always been 
practicing the policy of a closed country such a policy is most 
detrimental to us he said

the department of energy will allow outside 
researchers to examine health records of workers who have been 
exposed to radiation at government nuclear projects the agency 
announced friday 
the records which date to the manhattan project atomic bomb 
experiments of the early 1940s are considered the largest body of 
information on the effects of radiation exposure 
records on some 600000 workers from about 50 government 
facilities will be opened for scientific scrutiny 
the national academy of sciences has been given a 297000 grant 
to determine how to make the data public without violating privacy 
laws or agreements with state health agencies 
spokesman jeff sherwood said the agency hoped the records would 
be open by fall 
energy secretary james watkins said in a letter to sen john 
glenn dohio that he had ordered the department to establish a 
national repository for all epidemiologically relevant information 
on doe workers 
glenn was one of several lawmakers who had pressed for release of 
the data 
under questioning at a february house hearing troy wade 
assistant secretary for defense programs said he didnt know any 
reason why the information couldnt be released 
in addition to information on facilities in his own state glenn 
has asked the energy department for detailed information on the 
exposure of workers at the hanford nuclear reservation in washington 
state and in his letter watkins said the department was researching 
the answers and letting it be reviewed by department lawyers 
because of ongoing litigation there 
the committee glenn heads also has asked the department to 
explain why its epidemiological studies of workers exposed to 
radiation did not include workers at the nevada test site and the 
idaho national engineering laboratory 
some have argued that workers at those sites may have been 
exposed to more radiation than any others in the governments 
nuclear weapons complex 
there were aboveground nuclear tests at nevada until the early 
1960s and energy department documents have shown that between 1957 
and 1963 there were intentional atmospheric releases of radioactive 
gases from the idaho lab

eduardo dos santos signed the truce accord and sealed it with a 
handshake late thursday at a special african summit to promote peace 
in angola 
i was not born to make war at all cost savimbi said before 
leaving to carry word of the ceasefire to his forces even if i 
have made war until now for precise reasons and even if these 
reasons cease to exist i will always remain in my skin a citizen 
of angola 
shooting was to stop at midnight friday 7 pm edt savimbi 
told the zairian news agency he is prepared to work without 
preconditions with dos santos government

in drafting a permanent peace agreement 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire a savimbi ally credited with 
a prominent role in the reconciliation also will mediate future 
negotiations 
the conservative mobutu is to meet president bush in washington 
on thursday to discuss zaires role in helping bring peace to 
southern africa said bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater

washington that the summit represents a significant breakthrough 
in efforts to peacefully resolve angolas longrunning civil war

african unity announced the ceasefire at a news conference in 
gbadolite mobutus hometown and the palatial site of the summit 
400 miles northeast of zaires capital kinshasa

between dos santos and savimbi since the former allies in a struggle 
for black rule went to war in 1975 as portuguese colonizers left 
angola the conflict has claimed tens of thousands of casualties 
savimbi leads the national union for the total independence of 
angola known as unita which has been backed by china south africa 
and washington in its fight to share power with dos santos marxist 
popular movement for the liberation of angola 
the peace accord follows a usbrokered regional peace accord 
was signed in new york in december south africa which backed 
savimbi agreed to grant independence to namibia angolas southern 
neighbor and halt aid to savimbis guerrillas in exchange for the 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops backing dos santos government 
savimbi was not party to the agreement 
zambian president kenneth kaunda described thursdays signing of 
what is called the declaration of gbadolite a great moment for 
africa 
kaunda said savimbi will go into selfexile but did not provide

the integration of rebel fighters into national life 
the summit adopted an eightpoint declaration drafted by mobutu 
and explicitly accepted by dos santos and savimbi which proclaimed 
the will of the daughters and sons of angola to put an end to war 
and to proclaim their national reconciliation to the world 
at a separate news conference mobutu said savimbi reaffirmed 
that he had no intention of participating in the next government it 
is not up to us to tell the angolans or savimbi what title he will 
bear 
reports in zaire said savimbis selfexile would be temporary 
but rebel sources in washington said the reports are all 
wrong 
savimbi will remain in angola a rebel official said on 
condition of anonymity 
the accord calls for the creation of a national reconciliation 
commission under mobutus chairmanship it set no time or place for 
the commission to begin its work and did not specify who would 
represent the rival angolan parties

would meet in the next few days in zimbabwe to give form to the 
gbadolite accord it gave no details 
lusa also reported that dos santos briefed the 12 members of his 
party politburo in luanda on details of the accord 
diplomatic sources in kinshasa speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the united states and south africa deserved credit 
for exerting influence on savimbi whom they supplied with arms 
meanwhile angolas government has been under growing pressure to 
reach a peaceful settlement from its main arms supplier the soviet 
union

china arrested at least 20 more prodemocracy 
students and their supporters friday and the armys propaganda 
chief took over as editorinchief of the peoples daily the 
communist partys official paper 
the change in editors comes as a campaign is under way to blanket 
china with propaganda justifying the harsh suppression of 
prodemocracy activists 
more than 1700 people have been arrested and 27 executed since 
a nationwide crackdown began almost three weeks ago 
nightshift workers were ordered to make sure they carried their 
work identification papers on saturday because police planned to 
step up their search for protesters a chinese source said 
at the peoples daily the papers foreign affairs office said 
saturday that shao huaze director of the propaganda department of 
the peoples liberation army replaced tan wenrui as chief editor of 
chinas leading paper 
it said director qian liren also left his post and was replaced 
by gao di a senior official in the central party school of the 
party central committee 
bot qian and tan resigned because of health the office said 
without elaborating and without specifying when the changes took 
place 
on saturday much of the the peoples daily front page was filled 
with excerpts of speeches by senior leader deng xiaoping going back 
to 1979 in them deng said china can never abide drifting toward 
adopting western ideas and culture and must strictly adhere to 
communist party rule 
the shuffle at the paper came as the party stepped up its drive 
to brand participants in the nowcrushed student prodemocracy 
movement as counterrevolutionaries and justify the arrests and 
summary executions of protesters 
it also appeared aimed at revamping the leadership of the 
official media hundreds of journalists from all major national 
dailies and broadcasting stations participated in prodemocracy 
marches and for a brief time in late may the official press was 
freer than it had ever been 
the press quickly reverted to being an organ for government and 
party propaganda after the june 34 military drive to quash the 
democracy movement that left hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
unarmed people dead 
early friday there was heavy activity by security forces in 
northern beijing where several shots were fired and the smell of 
tear gas filled the air residents said 
there were unconfirmed reports that the communist partys central 
committee had opened a meeting in beijing to deal with party chief 
zhao ziyang and propaganda head hu qili who apparently have been 
stripped of power 
the party was expected to act to oust them officially from their 
posts and the party for expressing sympathy for demands for a freer 
society 
top leaders were absent from tv news reports and a large number 
of soldiers checked all vehicles on beijings main avenue friday 
night fueling speculation about a committee meeting 
soldiers crushed seven weeks of studentled demonstrations when 
they marched into beijing on the night of june 34 and cleared 
tiananmen square of thousands of protesters 
the xinhua news agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and police 
died and that thousands were injured in the subsequent crackdown 
while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1000 were injured 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death 
toll may have been as high as 3000 
despite international pleas for clemency authorities executed 27 
people wednesday and thursday including seven in beijing for 
attacking soldiers and destroying military vehicles when the army 
entered the city 
beijing radio friday reported the arrest of li bin a worker 
accused of killing liu guogeng a soldier who was beaten and burned 
to death and now regarded as a martyr 
evening tv and radio reports said police arrested liu xiaobo an 
instructor at beijing teachers university who recently returned 
from six months in the united states 
liu joined the china democratic league an organization of 
chinese dissidents in the united states and published 
anticommunist essays overseas the reports said he also called for 
an end to oneparty rule and was in close contact with leaders of 
the democracy movement in beijing they said 
the government has said foreign involvement helped the students 
press their movement on thursday authorities arrested 13 people 
accused of spying for taiwan and fomenting unrest 
cbs news reported 17 students and teachers were arrested at four 
universities in beijing thursday night and friday 
four student leaders and one worker were arrested in zhangjiakou 
about 110 miles northwest of beijing official chinese news reports 
said 
peoples daily said in an editorial that prodemocracy protesters 
attempted to use the model of western capitalist countries to 
transform chinas hardwon socialist system 
class struggle is still going on and we should not lower our 
vigilance the editorial said invoking a rallying cry not heard 
since the 196676 cultural revolution during that decade 
authorities punished thousands of chinese deemed class enemies 
deng was among those victims

a kidnapped army colonel killed during 
a shootout between police and the abductor apparently was hit by a 
police bullet a spokesman reported friday 
dutch army col karel van de kieft 56 was slain thursday when 
police intercepted his car about two hours after he had been 
kidnapped by stefan kroger a 33yearold west german from hanover 
who had fled from a german prison 
the gunfight occurred after police blocked the car in a service 
station on the arnhemutrecht freeway 
van de kieft was killed by a shot in the head but kroger was not 
injured 
according to preliminary findings he van de kieft was 
probably hit by a bullet fired by police said police spokesman 
bert albers he reported investigators have not determined the 
motive for the abduction and said kroger is still being questioned 
at one point during a standoff between kroger and the police 
kroger demanded a ransom of one million guilders 454000 and 100 
grams or about 3 ounces of heroin 
television tapes showed policemen with uzi submachineguns 
charging toward van de kiefts ford escort from a distance of about 
45 feet the colonel could be seen in the drivers seat slumped 
behind the wheel 
police said kroger had a handgun but albers would not say what 
type or caliber 
albers said the number of shots fired by police and by kroger is 
still unclear 
a preliminary autopsy report concluded the colonel was killed 
by a police bullet but it has not yet been firmly established 
the spokesman added 
he said van de kieft was on his way to work when kroger forced 
his way at gunpoint into the colonels car about 12 miles north of 
arnhem 
west german authorities reported kroger had been jailed in 
braunschweig and failed to return from a oneday prison furlough 
according to albers 
he said west german officials are preparing an extradition 
request for kroger in connection with an armed robbery in 
braunschweig in which a 70yearold man was seriously injured 
albers said if kroger is convicted of a crime in the netherlands 
he would have to serve the sentence here before he would be 
extradited to west germany

jewish holocaust survivors who adjusted best to 
life after world war ii were able to seal away their traumas so 
successfully that they protect even their presentday dreams 
according to an israeli study 
the findings suggest that modern techniques of treating 
posttraumatic stress syndrome such as that suffered by vietnam war 
veterans may actually be aggravating the disorder instead of curing 
it said peretz lavie a psychology professor at technionisrael 
institute of technology in haifa where the study was conducted 
in a paper prepared for presentation today at the annual meeting 
of the association of professional sleep societies lavie said a 
study of a group of survivors of the holocaust found those who were 
the most healthy mentally had learned to suppress recall of 
virtually all dreams 
this he said was a defense mechanism against the awful memories 
of the nazi persecution of jews during world war ii

the supreme court struck a blow against 
organized crime and drug dealers by letting the government seize 
assets which defendants wish to use to pay their lawyers the 
nations chief law enforcement officer says 
but attorneys groups said a pair of high court rulings thursday 
undermines the nations system of justice tipping the balance 
unfairly in favor of prosecutors 
the court in two 54 decisions upheld the constitutionality of 
federal laws that permit the confiscation of money and property from 
people accused of crimes even if it means they cannot afford a 
lawyer 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the rulings are a notable 
victory in the governments war on drugs as the court put it 
congress did not write this law to rewrite the old adage that crime 
does not pay to read crime does not pay except for attorneys 
fees 
but scott wallace of the national association of criminal defense 
lawyers said we see these cases as a national tragedy the 
clarence darrows of today and tomorrow are going to go into some 
other area of the law

by congress to shield children from sexually oriented telephone 
messages 
the court said in its unanimous decision that congress went too 
far last year when it passed a law banning all sexually oriented 
phone message services 
only obscene messages and not messages that merely are 
indecent may be outlawed the court said it said a blanket 
ban would violate freespeech rights 
the case before us today does not require us to decide what is 
obscene or what is indecent said justice byron r white writing 
for the court 
a phone conversation like an explicit movie or centerfold in an 
adult magazine may or may not be obscene a designation that must 
be decided by local juries on a casebycase basis 
material deemed to be indecent rather than obscene is protected

long program of helpproviders said schools superintendent robert 
ricci on friday 
its nothing that hasnt been done but most districts arent 
that flexible ricci said theres a blueprint here for urban 
districts

students from ninth grade through the day they should graduate the 
traditional method is to compare senior classes from year to year 
by tracking incoming ninthgraders the schools can more accurately 
assess whether the programs are working experts said

youve just been to the theater and want a 
leisurely latenight meal in europes largest city and a world 
cultural capital easy right in london not necessarily 
the other night after the show we were trying to find a place 
to eat and there was no place to go said ann crumb the american 
star of andrew lloyd webbers new smash musical aspects of 
love at the prince of wales theater 
the places that serve up to midnight or later are few they are 
led by the americanowned orso and joe allen in covent garden both 
frequented by theater people and an array of chinese restaurants in 
soho that stay open until the wee hours 
elsewhere the choices are slim up to 11 pm london is abuzz 
with activity then suddenly it becomes a graveyard of upended 
restaurant chairs littered sidewalks and lost souls torn between 
that elusive last drink and the last bus home 
only soho and covent garden are alive past midnight 
its totally antiquated and stupid said drew smith of the 
consumers association and a food writer and critic for the guardian 
newspaper 
i think its very unfortunate that in a major international city 
you dont have the latenight restaurant service that should go with 
it 
but londons attitude toward latenight dining is symptomatic of 
life as a whole the english generally call it quits early many bus 
routes are suspended after rush hour the subway stops soon after 
midnight the law requires pubs to serve last drinks at 1050 pm 
bbctv goes off the air around midnight although the two commercial 
networks operate all night 
so much of it has to do with the style of living here said 
richard polo the american restaurateur who manages joe allen and 
orso you can go to paris at 1 am and see restaurants full of 
people londons not like that 
polo came to london in 1977 to open joe allen here following its 
success in new york its more upmarket sister establishment orso 
opened in 1985 and polo says both do about onequarter of their 
daily business after the curtain falls last orders at orso are at 
12 midnight at joe allen 1245 am 
theater curtains rise in london at 730 and 8 pm and fall 
between 10 and 11 pm 
englishman peter ward who manages the central london restaurants 
inigo jones and the newly opened burts says the problem is in the 
national temperament 
were not an eatingout society he said continentals and 
new yorkers together are much more serious eaters than british and 
the londoners 
the moment its curtain down people are on their way back to 
croydon or brighton ward added theres less of the joy in the 
social gathering of eating here its a chore and a necessity 
geography and the law play a part where new yorks manhattan and 
paris are relatively compact londons urban sprawl makes it 
impractical to walk home from a posttheater meal those who miss 
the last subway have no way home except in relatively expensive 
taxis or irregular night buses 
places wanting to serve late face a morass of legal red tape the 
extended hours order covers restaurants open until 1 am and the 
special hours certificate allows for openings up to 2 am or in 
central london 3 am provided there is music and dancing 
david lavendar a london lawyer who specializes in licensing 
issues said the law allowed a wholly artificial restriction on 
hours 
in france you must close half an hour out of every 24 and 
thats for cleaning said lavendar here a publican can be 
prosecuted for leaving a drink on the table at 1121 pm 
jeremy rounds food critic of the independent newspaper also 
deplores this state of affairs but believes london isnt unique 
im always surprised in america by how early america closes 
down he said try getting a meal late in atlanta 
the very best places at an international level are the sorts 
that in other capitals wouldnt be open late either he added 
dewyeyed young men have been telling me for years theres 
nowhere to eat late in london said peter boizot proprietor of 
the pizza express chain and chairman of the soho restaurateurs 
association which has more than 50 member eateries 
but in my experience he said the ones that have opened 
are not that wellfrequented

when you are selling eternal salvation the 
rev tom forrest says there is no room for small thinking 
so the brooklynborn roman catholic preacher thinks big 
he is the driving force behind lumen 2000 a controversial group 
that wants to give the roman catholic church its own form of 
televangelism on a world scale 
since its founding in 1986 lumen has set up media schools 
produced a popular soap opera and distributed scores of tv and video 
programs to africa latin america and asia 
but critics particularly in latin america charge lumen 2000 is 
a conservative arm of the vatican threatening to supplant local 
initiatives 
they think were going to go in like the big ugly american and 
take over said an official at lumens office in rome the rev 
jim bermingham 
with the tacit approval of the pope lumen is aiming to be a 
privatesector answer to one of the vaticans dearest wishes to 
harness television to spread the faith 
the catholic church is backward in television communications 
said forrest a wiry 61yearold former missionary who heads 
evangelization 2000 the umbrella organization that includes lumen 
tv is not only the best means of communication today its the 
most expensive and the most requiring of utter professionalism 
in 1987 lumen cosponsored a satellite hookup through which 
pope john paul ii led catholics on five continents in prayer 
lumen the name comes word meaning a measure of the flow of 
light differs from protestant televangelists such as pat 
robertson or jimmy swaggart in providing a variety of programs with 
few dominant personalities 
its dallasbased film library offers catholic groups around the 
world a choice of footage and more than 1000 inspirational 
programs many donated by such catholic media groups as the new 
yorkbased christophers or mother angelica a nun who runs a cable 
network in birmingham ala 
lumen also donates equipment and trains third world tv 
journalists at its centers in dallas and bogota colombia 
but lumens ultimate aim is to establish christian entertainment 
good enough to compete with toprun programs on regular television 
i think we could do programming all visuals not just talking 
heads forrest said in an interview i believe we have very 
exciting answers 
lumen produced its first entertainment program last year a 
miniseries about a latin american priest semilla de mostaza 
mustard seed was popular enough to get commercial sponsorship on 
colombian television lumen has another series in the works 
lumens other major program a tv newsmagazine about the 
church intended for use worldwide will be ready early next year 
lumen has been influenced by its founders membership in the 
catholic charismatic movement which emphasizes personal 
spirituality and spreading the faith 
those goals have brought the group into conflict with another 
movement in the church liberation theology 
liberation theology which has flourished in latin america 
although the vatican rejects parts of it stresses activism on 
behalf of the oppressed and encourages a local focus 
some of its proponents accuse lumen leaders of being spiritual 
colonialists for their worldwide ambitions and emphasis on the 
church hierarchy 
lumen 2000 is evidence of the success of the theology of 
liberation and of the fear and anger it arouses in conservative 
groups said jose queiroz a theologian who coordinates the 
religious studies postgraduate program at catholic university in 
sao paulo brazil 
bishop tomas balduino a leading progressive based in the 
brazilian state of goias recently was quoted by the jornal do 
brasil newspaper in rio de janeiro as saying evangelization 2000 
is an illegitimate and nefarious project trying to enter through 
the back door without asking the brazilian bishops permission 
lumen leaders say they follow the guidelines of the vatican 
which opposes the forms of liberation theology that stress marxist 
principles 
they brush the criticism aside 
it has been quite extraordinary to see because of the 
incredible fantasies forrest said like im supposed to have 
400 million they have us getting money from the cia 
lumen gets most of its money from a foundation created by piet 
dirksen a dutch millionaire and charismatic who is lumens 
president 
lumen has had its greatest growth in latin america despite the 
criticism that emanates from there it focuses on the third world 
where the church is expanding and television time is often available 
to religious groups for little cost 
church officials stress however that lumen is not a vatican 
project 
its a private initiative with a very commendable purpose 
which is to spread the word of god through the communications 
media said the president of the vaticans commission on social 
communications archbishop john foley an american with a degree 
from columbia journalism school 
in a recent speech pope paul said the question confronting 
the church today is not any longer whether the man in the street can 
grasp a religious message but how to employ the communications 
media so as to let him have the full impact of the gospel message

i am a farmer by birth and in no 
time in my life have things been so difficult as now 
park sunghwan was telling a visitor to his 4acre farm how 
difficult it has been for him and other south korean farmers since 
south korea switched emphasis from the farm to the factory 
like thousands of other south korean farmers the 55yearold 
park is fighting to stay in business 
farmers face mounting debts growing foreign competition a 
disintegration of farm families and an inability to make their tiny 
holdings produce enough 
south koreas agricultural sector remains reliant on manual labor 
and farms still are small 
but many farmers blame the united states for their problems 
claiming us trade pressure to increase food imports to south korea 
to reduce the us trade deficit is driving them out of business 
the united states is no longer my friend park said they 
are destroying my family 
park earns the equivalent of about 10000 a year growing rice 
and tobacco rice tobacco fruit and vegetables are south koreas 
main crops the united states now is exporting wheat corn tobacco 
fruit meat and cotton to south korea the main competition for 
south korean farmers is in tobacco fruit and in some areas meat 
park says he does not bring in enough money to keep the farm 
running and support his wife and three children 
his income dropped 30 percent after us cigarette imports cut 
his tobacco sales he said he has been unable to pay interest on a 
bank loan of 13000 he took five years ago and the debt has swollen 
to 15000 
i have no hope and feel like dying he said outside his 
tworoom house in hwasung 60 miles south of seoul i have no one 
to turn to for help 
suicide has become a problem among hardpressed korean farmers 
about a dozen farmers under financial pressure have committed 
suicide this year according to the catholic farmers association 
during an agricultural slump in 198384 as many as 40 farmers 
unable to pay back government loans they used to buy cattle took 
their lives the association said 
agricultural experts say chronic farm problems may cause serious 
social unrest and they urge the government to restructure the farm 
industry 
the farm situation has reached its limit and become a serious 
political issue said huh shinhaeng an agricultural specialist 
with the statefinanced korea rural economic institute 
poor management low investment poor irrigation a lack of 
arable land and the lack of mechanization make farming increasingly 
uneconomical huh said 
he added that south koreas farm population of 84 million 
people about onefifth of the population is declining at an annual 
rate of 450000 people as young farmers leave the countryside for 
the better life of the cities many young men cannot find brides if 
they stay on the farm 
while no figures are available on how many farmers are in 
financial trouble huh estimated that the debt among south koreas 
18 million farm families averages out to 4200 per household a 
large sum by korean standards the money is owed to the staterun 
agricultural cooperative 
the united states which during the past two years had a trade 
deficit of 183 billion with south korea is pushing to open the 
korean market to american goods especially the agriculural sector 
south korea is washingtons second largest farm market after 
japan south korea purchased 23 billion worth of american farm 
products last year 
but us officials say the south korean market is still far from 
open to imports and further trade liberalization is needed the 
united states wants the same open access to south korean markets 
that south korea has to american markets 
under us pressure south korea opened its cigarette market 
estimated at 12 billion a year in 1987 
that hurt park and other tobacco growers 
but park and other farmers say the south korean government is as 
much to blame for the problems facing many farming families farmers 
complain that the government has favored industry to increase 
exports and done little to help the agricultural sector 
why does the government sacrifice poor farmers to export more 
cars television sets and vcrs park asked 
the government recently announced plans to pour 20 billion into 
mordernizing the farm industry by 1995 but the news was received 
with skepticism by many farmers and government critics 
we farmers have been deceived so many times said bae 
jongyul a dissident leader it is doubtful that the foundering 
farm industry can be transformed in several years 
bae a farmer who is cochairman of the nations largest 
dissident organization the united national democratic movement 
said farmers must become politically aware and unite to protect 
their interests 
he said his group plans a nationwide campaign to oppose foreign 
agricultural imports 
of course the main target will be the united states he 
added

now why would cbs not buy a series about comic 
teenage bounty hunters 
bmen airs tuesday the latest offering in the cbs summer 
playhouse series summer playhouse is a nice name for dud 
pilots 
james macdonald and david arnott a sort of dan aykroydjohn 
belushiinspired pairing star as two wisemouth high schoolers who 
win a 25000 reward after accidentally capturing the 714 
killer a crazed motorcycle madman who kills people who live in 
the 714 area code 
despite a convoluted plotline and bumpy direction the pilot does 
have its moments of wit thanks to the satiric script by dave 
thomas a former member of sctv and rick kellard they are also 
coexecutive producers 
cbs no doubt made the right decision in not picking this one up 
based on the pilot ultimately theres too much dumb stuff to wade 
through to get to the few good parts 
but in the midst of all the predictable bunk on summer rerun tv 
fans of sendup might find bmen worth a look while many of the 
jokes dont work there are several smiles and even an occasional 
outright laugh or two talkshow host joe franklin makes a cameo 
appearance as himself cut to the boys out on the street carrying 
the ungainly 5by 3foot cardboard check the reward presented to 
them by the city on franklins show they successfully deposit it in 
a normalsize bank 
jim macdonald decides that 25000 for bagging the biker is the 
perfect launching pad for a lucrative new career but kevin arnott 
is skeptical to be a bounty hunter he argues you have to have a 
beard that grows twice a day 
theres a poke at the prevailing teenappeal view of 80s parents 
when jim informs his folks over dinner about his new afterschool 
job so how are you going to juggle this and school wonders 
distracted dad james staley i dont think its going to 
interfere with my schoolwork dad jim insists well fine 
says dad pass the veggies dear 
jim convinced that bounty hunting will be a snap tears wanted 
posters off the post office bulletin board go home and tell your 
children the streets are safe again he announces to a wary line 
of postal patrons 
at night jim and kevin cruise seedy hollywood boulevard copying 
tv cops who always find miscellaneous sleazoids and ladies of the 
night to tell them where the criminals are hiding want a date 
queries a scantily clad woman no thanks says kevin were 
looking for hookers 
jim and kevin set themselves up with a wildly artdeco 
afterschool office and hire a vavavoom secretary kimberly 
foster who impresses their schoolmates by showing up during class 
to deliver messages 
the plot is overcomplicated by the intrustion of a madman police 
lieutenant john vernon a real bounty hunter albert salmi and a 
comic gang of motorcycle toughs who enlist the escaped 714 
killer david patrick kelly he in the spirit of the cartoonish 
violence is repeatedly beaned beaten and run down by cars only to 
pop up again like wile e coyote 
the plot thickens even further when the boys secretary is 
kidnapped by the gang we cant quit now declares kevin we 
sure cant agrees jim kevin reconsiders but wouldnt it be 
great if we could 
there is more in bmen that doesnt work than does but 
thomas and kellard at least tried something a little different 
hopefully theyll try again

a grim abandoned building now stands on 
stuyvesant avenue the defining boulevard of brooklyns historic 
bedfordstuyvesant where sals famous pizzeria squeezed racial 
tensions to a tragic head in spike lees explosive new movie do 
the right thing 
the korean grocery that faced sals across the street is also 
gone removed from the lot of constance newkirk one of the 
neighborhoods senior residents she stood before her home on the 
corner of quincy street and stuyvesant avenue one recent sunny day 
reminiscing about the brief upheaval last may when the celebrated 
filmmaker and his crew invaded the area with its movie magic 
i got to know quite a few of them newkirk said i wanted 
to know what was going on i met spike and the fellows that were 
building they had to take measurements for my house corners 
windows and everything 
they built the pizza parlor across the street they had all the 
equipment anything you would need to make pizza they came in big 
trucks brand new ovens ice machines soda fountains tiffany 
lights pictures the whole works 
lee whose awardwinning thesis work for new york university film 
school also took place in bedfordstuyvesant chose one of the 
nations oldest black communities as the location for do the right 
thing 
the action takes place during a sweltering summer in and around 
sals famous pizza run by an italian danny aiello in a 
lowermiddleclass section of brooklyns largely black 
bedfordstuyvesant tensions of family race friendship and love 
run high tensions between sals hothead and racist son vito and 
an angry black radio raheem lead to the raheems murder by police 
and the destruction of the pizza parlor 
bedfordstuyvesants reputation has fallen on bad times in recent 
years but in fact this most populous of urban black communities 
contains some of new york citys most ornate brownstones some of 
them designated landmarks many of the dwellings have been owned by 
middleclass black families for generations and affluent black 
professionals live close to some of the citys toughest blocks 
newkirk has seen her neighborhood change dramatically 
remembering the lush trees that once lined the block and the lovely 
gaslights that turned on at dusk but hard economic times and drugs 
have affected her community a crack house on the block was closed 
before production on the film started 
still newkirk who has lived in the same house for over 50 
years can not recall any incident like the race riot that comes at 
end of do the right thing 
its a peaceful neighborhood definitely considering with the 
crack and everything she said on the whole this place is 
pretty quiet no robberies or shootings we have very little 
trouble 
during all the years newkirk has lived on stuyvesant avenue 
edward alexis connors has been her neighbor he proudly described 
newkirks home as a local landmark built more than a century ago 
and agreed that the block is a peaceful one with little trouble 
from kids or police 
we make it peaceful connors said we dont turn the other 
cheek we had some static but we handled it we have a good police 
force and an excellent fire force 
the nearest pizzeria campm pizza is a few blocks away on 
broadway a heavily commercial street matt the stores owner for 
12 years is an hispanic who has never experienced the troubles with 
local black kids as sal did in do the right thing 
in the movie a black nationalist named buggin out giancarlo 
esposito incites a violent confrontation when he demands that sal 
include famous blacks on his wall of fame instead of the 
italianamericans whose photographs paper the wall sal refuses 
insisting that its his pizzeria and hes italian 
you get a hard time any place you go but ive had no racial 
problems said matt who asked that his last name not be used 
you get crack dealers but who doesnt i dont allow that in 
here they go out in the street 
jo rob turner 31 and justice carter 29 have lived in 
bedfordstuyvesant most of their lives they sipped cokes and talked 
about their neighborhood while sitting at a table at campm 
blacks puerto ricans and orientals hang out together turner 
said there are a lot of interracial couples more than in the 
60s and the 70s 
white folks come here without being bothered you notice its 
not something that happens every single day but aint you walkin 
lovely 
the media makes it more extreme carter said everybody 
seems ok you dont see that much racial stuff as before 
everybodys trying to get along theres been a lot of acceptance of 
minorities 
the neighborhood in lees movie consists of blacks hispanics 
italians koreans and a white bikeriding urban pioneer played 
by john savage 
carter and turner agreed that crack is bedfordstuyvesants 
greatest problem 
crack has altered lives in phenomenal ways turner said 
that is the worst baddest drug that ever hit the market ive 
seen kids 11 or 12 years old eating out of vials of crack 
the first time you take that puff youre off to a race said 
carter who talked of the absence of drugs in the movie the story 
was about racism and that was going to sell 
turner said do the right thing could help outsiders 
understand life in bedfordstuyvesant but quickly added that a film 
can never replace firsthand knowledge 
thats a blessing and a curse he said a blessing because 
some of the things that weve encountered we cant believe we 
actually got through it but it also makes youre blind to one 
side theres book knowledge and street knowledge and youve got to 
walk the streets youve got to want to know and thats the only 
way to better understanding

gilberto campos was alarmed when he 
found his sons sniffing green rocks that kids carried away from the 
municipal dump 
fourteenyearold luis and 18yearold jose lurched and stumbled 
in the unpaved streets occasionally pulling a sock out of a pocket 
and sniffing it the socks held a bright green rocky substance that 
smelled like airplane glue or spray paint when crushed and sniffed 
it gave the same cheap highs 
the rocks surfaced in march and quickly became the drug of choice 
around the vast dump an area where the welloff live in cinderblock 
houses and others make do with cardboard huts young children 
flocked to it according to dozens of worried parents interviewed by 
juarez newspapers 
it makes people stupid and aggressive more aggressive than a 
drunk said campos whose sons shoved and hit him when he 
confronted them they would lie on the couch and wouldnt get up 
the green rocks proved to be toxic waste dumped by a 
maquiladora one of 275 usowned factories located in juarez 
to take advantage of cheap labor mexican environmental suspect 
maquiladoras improperly dispose of half their hazardous waste that 
would be hundreds of tons a year in juarez alone 
the officials in juarez say they have gotten rid of the green 
rocks and cracked down on toxic wastes at the dump but gangs of 
toughs known as cholos still collect and sell intoxicating 
substances 
campos didnt know any of that in late march when he took some of 
the rocks to a reform school principal she didnt know what they 
were 
about the same time a woman walked into the centro de 
integracion juvenil a drug treatment center for children and told 
psychologist raul bueno that her 10yearold son was sniffing green 
rocks she said that at the dump there were lots of other 
children who used this 
bueno who estimates that about 200 children experimented with 
the substance sent it to the secretariat urban development and 
ecology or sedue the beleaguered equivalent of the us 
environmental protection agency 
sedue identified it as solidified kaltex an industrial solvent 
containing toluene a petroleum derivative that can cause lung 
damage 
a doctor told campos the kaltex did more than that to his sons 
when they get married they cant have children campos said 
infertility is one possible side effect when adolescents use 
inhalants like toluene said dr antonio carrasco of the la fe 
family clinic in south el paso where inhalant abuse is widespread 
if users dont become infertile their children are likely to be 
deformed 
inhalants harm the liver and kidneys and can cause organic brain 
syndrome characterized by loss of coordination irritability 
chronic confusion and nerve injury carrasco said and they can 
destroy tear ducts 
after a while they cant even cry and theyre subject to eye 
infections he said i think inhalant abuse is one of the worst 
and its one of the most available for young kids 
parents reported seeing cholos jumping onto trucks turning off 
avenue of the aztecs onto the dirt road leading to the dump the 
cholos would toss five 10 and 20gallon plastic buckets of waste 
off to sell when sedue officials inspected the dump april 6 they 
found dozens of buckets of kaltex 
campos who kept several chunks of kaltex as souvenirs said a 
piece the size of his foot goes for 10000 pesos about 435 
in late april sedue traced the kaltex to outboard marine de 
mexico which makes parts for johnson and evinrude outboard boat 
engines 
officials at the waukegan illbased manufacturer referred all 
questions to tim anklam manufacturing engineer in the juarez plant 
anklam said news reports about the solvent residue had been 
greatly exaggerated and that representatives from the factory and 
sedue scoured the dump in late april and found three fivegallon 
plastic buckets that had originated at outboard marine de mexico 
called omex for short 
omex accepts the possibility that the three pails could 
have been dumped by accident at the juarez landfill it was just a 
human error if in fact it is ours a lot of companies use similar 
materials around here said anklam adding that omex is 
cooperating with sedue and acting legally 
mexican law requires hazardous waste from maquiladoras to be 
returned to their place of origin usually the united states us 
law requires companies returning hazardous waste to texas to notify 
the texas water commission which shares information with the epa 
but roger meacham epa spokesman in dallas said tracking waste 
through paperwork is timeconsuming and even if the epa had no 
record of a company returning waste to the united states it 
wouldnt mean much 
if the wastes are from raw materials from mexico they can be 
disposed of in mexico he said or if its recyclable it can be 
recycled in mexico or they can store their waste onsite in mexico 
indefinitely 
rosa manuela salas chief of sedues office in juarez said omex 
is complying with mexican law she referred all other questions to 
carlos james communications chief for sedue james did not return 
numerous calls to his home and office from the associated press 
ms salas told the newspaper diario de juarez that omex was the 
first maquiladora to be caught throwing toxic waste into the juarez 
dump to ensure this doesnt happen again were giving an 
identification number to each business that generates waste to make 
it easier to watch them 
but it is difficult for sedue to keep watch the agency has 10 
inspectors in juarez to monitor 275 maquiladoras and at least 100 
mexicanowned factories faced with a crushing national debt a 
severe housing shortage and a population boom that adds 1 million 
people to the work force a year mexicos government has not been 
able to make environmental protection a high priority 
so far sedues plan doesnt seem to be working luis hernandez 
the dumps foreman said he doesnt know whats in the scores of 
trucks that deposit waste in the landfill daily neither do the 
drivers he said 
but the cholos seem to know they still wait at the corner where 
trucks turn to go to the dump they still jump on and they still 
toss buckets off the speeding trucks for collection later 
luis campos takes part 
there are 10 other kinds of intoxicants there gilberto 
campos said paint adhesive 
he shrugged helplessly lowered his gaze and sighed

he was blacklisted as a film actor for calling members of the house 
unamerican activities committee unamerican 
the gravelvoiced actor best known for his tv role as sam on 
hart to hart stars in the new series with norm crosby norman

nobody knows gene had been using a front until a producer had 
enough guts to put his name on a script stander said he tells 
this to a young man in the club as he tries to explain the hysteria 
of the time people were called traitors simply for dissenting 
i was blacklisted when i went before the unamerican activities 
committee and called them unamerican i condemned the committee 
and history proved me right but i was blacklisted anyway i became 
a stockbroker and made more money than i ever had as an actor but i 
wasnt happy 
stander who had made his film debut in 1932 was unable to find

gasguzzling dinosaurs graze 
alongside the most modern machines at margaret cranes minimart 
their owners lining up for the privilege of paying 259 cents for a 
gallon of gas 
but what a gallon of gas it is unleaded 100octane racing fuel 
super juice for the almostextinct muscle cars of the 1960s 
and the sports cars of tomorrow 
i had one man come in here with a beautiful sports car and he 
said his car deserved it some other man just put in 44 said 
ms crane manager of the unocal 76 station in this welltodo 
suburb north of chicago 
i thought when i first got it at 259 id never sell it 
but after two months of offering the gas she noted they dont 
seem to mind about the money 
stuart cannes unocals manager of racingproduct sales said the 
gasoline is available at about 450 service stations nationwide 
including some two dozen in illinois 
performance is back in vogue cannes said theres no other 
product that a customer with a 70000dollar automobile would put in 
his gas tank 
ms crane said most of her buyers are people in their 20s and 30s 
who own latemodel porsches corvettes camaros trans ams and 
motorcycles or the muscle cars of an earlier era gtos 
roadrunners and chargers 
most buyers mix the racing gas with a lower octane gas about 92 
or 93 for superunleaded and come out with an average of 96 
octane cannes said most cars run on 87octane gasoline 
cannes said a higher octane level helps a highperformance 
engine run to its peak performance 
but he also said that los angelesbased unocal is not encouraging 
drivers to push their cars beyond speed limits or to race through 
the streets 
dick tippie director of transportation safety for the 
chicagobased national safety council said the council would be 
opposed to any kind of product that might encourage people to speed 
or drive recklessly 
it may not be promoting it but its one of those things that 
might lead especially the younger driver to think he could operate 
a vehicle differently than he could under normal circumstances

in the latest legal salvo in the fight for the 
magazine and cable giant time inc paramount communications inc 
asked a federal court to dismiss a suit that could block its 107 
billion takeover bid for time 
paramount a publisher and movie and tv producer also asked the 
us district court here to block times 14 billion tender offer 
for warner communications inc a film and records company 
paramount made those requests thursday in response to a suit time 
filed last week in an effort to thwart paramount from proceeding 
with its offer 
time and warner are locked in combat with paramount over how to 
create one of the worlds largest communications companies time and 
warner proposed a merger but paramount showed up with an uninvited 
offer for time 
their twoweekold fight has moved in recent days to the courts 
on wednesday paramount asked the delaware chancery court to 
block the time bid for warner a hearing on that case has been set 
for july 11 
in response to times federal suit on thursday paramount struck 
back at suggestions that its takeover of time would damage the 
journalistic integrity and independence of times publications 
it said time failed to disclose enough information about legal 
problems warner executives faced in the 1970s and early 1980s 
time and warner called paramounts filing an act of 
desperation 
in consolidated trading on the new york stock exchange time fell 
187 a share to 15537 warner rose 62 cents a share to 
5912 and paramount lost 75 cents a share to 5850 
time had agreed in march to merge with warner in a stock swap 
but amended that plan last week to provide for a 70ashare tender 
offer for warner 
in announcing the new deal time rejected paramounts 
175ashare offer for all of times shares and filed suit in us 
district court in new york to block paramount from proceeding with 
its offer it said paramount had made false and misleading 
statements in pursuing time 
in response paramount counterclaimed on thursday that time had 
made misleading statements and material omissions designed to 
deceive time stockholders in its offer for warner 
it said that by agreeing to the deal with warner time is 
forcing upon its shareholders a transaction whereby times 
integrity and financial future will fall under the control of 
warner whose executives in the recent past have been the subject of 
criminal investigation prosecution and in some cases conviction 
among other things paramount cited the 1977 federal 
investigation into the operations of the westchester premier 
theater two warner executives pleaded guilty and a third was 
convicted on charges in connection with warners purchase of shares 
in the theater 
paramount noted that warner chairman steven j ross was involved 
in the investigation ross was never charged with wrongdoing in the 
premier theater case however 
time said paramounts filing is an act of desperation full of 
stale accusations that do nothing to clarify the real issues we 
raised in our suit 
ross said the paramount filing was deliberately designed and 
intended to distract from the principal issues at hand by 
resurrecting old and entirely irrelevant points that have long since 
been thoroughly aired both in public and the courts 
in a separate development times 82 percentowned american 
television and communications corp said the city of casselberry 
fla had filed suit in us district court in florida asking that 
paramount be prohibited from taking ownership of its cable tv 
franchise there without necessary approvals 
atc said it was the first such suit by a city in which atc is 
operating 
a spokesman for paramount said the company has no intention of 
acquiring any cable franchise without state and local approvals

founders pledge to always have the news honest intelligent and 
unprejudiced bush said

kotlowitz for organizing fundraising efforts for needy people they 
wrote about 
fialka after writing in 1986 about the plight of poor retired

lafayette and his brother a season of peace in the woods of a 
wisconsin boys camp

without purpose means nothing said bush who urged corporate 
chieftains at the banquet to join the community service crusade bush

thousands of transactions at princetonnewport and see a pattern or 
to figure out what was happening hale testified

others spoke to him about the parking of securities 
just about everyone he said and named four other defendants

general electric co and ford motor co are trying 
to make night driving as brightly lit as a night baseball game 
the companies said thursday theyve joined in a venture to 
develop arc discharge lamps for cars like those in street and 
stadium lights ge officials said the lamps would blaze with a 
whiter light use less electricity and take more abuse than halogen 
lights on most cars now 
assuming that the product that we jointly design is attractive 
to the market and can be manufactured at a competitive price then 
there would be the opportunity for manufacturing and marketing it 
said bill peacock spokesman for fords diversified products 
operation 
the lights could appear on cars in the early 1990s said tom 
willis general manager of the project for general electrics ge 
lighting division in cleveland the companies didnt say how much 
they would spend on the development program 
stadium lights need warmup time but ge has developed an 
instanton version adaptable to cars spokesman john betchkal said 
ge officials estimate the worldwide market for auto lighting 
systems at 1 billion a year although the geford system isnt 
likely to be the only contender for the business 
its a very competitive arena and there are other people 
undoubtedly working on similar kinds of products peacock said 
general motors corps fisher guide division in anderson ind 
has been working with north american philips corp for more than 
four years on a highintensity discharge lighting system fisher 
guide spokesman robert b quinn said 
im sure we are exploring the new technologies chrysler 
corp spokesman ben dunn added 
the us department of transportation has been easing 
restrictions on headlights recently legalizing 3by3inch and 
2by3inch versions said mike henderson spokesman for corning 
inc which supplies lenses and reflectors for various companies 
experimental lights 
its created a smorgasbord of opportunity for auto design 
stylists henderson said 
the arc discharge system burns cooler than halogen or 
incandescent lamps allowing use of smaller lenses that also can be 
made of plastic willis said 
arc lights dont have filaments like halogen or incandescent 
lights and thus are less delicate betchkal said adding we 
expect the system to last the life of the car 
replacement in case of an accident is expected to cost more than 
for some current halogen systems but less than for others he said

ibm corp says its already producing an advanced 
component deemed crucial to future electronic products a disclosure 
that suggested the computer giant has an unexpected edge over japan 
ibm president jack d kuehler was quoted in todays editions of 
the new york times as saying the company is producing a fourmegabit 
memory chip in volume an industry expression that generally 
means in sufficient quantities for commercial application 
that would put international business machines several months 
ahead in the race to massproduce this type of dynamic random access 
memory chip or dram 
kuehler did not return telephone messages left on his home phone 
for comment on the times article but ibm spokesman peter judice 
told the associated press thursday night i can confirm we are 
producing fourmegabit chips in volume 
ibms disclosure was considered significant not only because the 
worlds biggest computer company historically has avoided giving 
away secrets but because it came one day after us computer makers 
announced a joint venture to challenges japans perceived supremacy 
in making the chip 
ibm and six other companies said they would form the first us 
consortium to build memory chips the consortium known as us 
memories inc expects to massproduce the chip starting in a few 
years 
ibm has suggested in the past that it has a strong interest in a 
solid us chipproducing industry that partly explains why the 
company is willing to share its technology with the consortium 
computer industry executives say 
it had been widely assumed japan was leading in the battle to 
gain early dominance in production of the fourmegabit chip an 
electronics component that can store 4 million bits of information 
or four times as much as any previous chip the fourmegabit chip is 
considered a vital element of virtually all of the advanced 
consumerproduct and defense technology of tomorrow 
gordon moore chairman of us memories said the consortium will 
use ibms advances in fourmegabit chips to have the jumpstart 
needed to quickly come on line as a serious player 
the other companies announcing the consortium were advanced 
micro devices inc digital equipment corp hewlettpackard co 
intel corp lsi logic corp and national semiconductor corp 
if approved the venture would break new ground in the federal 
governments attitude toward cooperation between competing 
companies the government has been steadily more permissive toward 
deals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on the theory 
that concerted action is necessary to meet foreign competition

two congressmen asked transportation secretary 
samuel skinner to enter the eastern airlines bankruptcy case out of 
urgent concern that the carriers restructuring could lessen 
airline competition 
in a letter wednesday to skinner house republican whip newt 
gingrich of georgia and rep tom campbell rcalif expressed 
concern that antitrust issues have not been addressed adequately in 
the eastern bankruptcy proceedings 
the letter also stated the two were worried that the plan by 
eastern parent texas air corp to rebuild the airline as a smaller 
carrier and sell 18 billion in assets could reduce easterns 
competitiveness 
our concern is urgent because it appears likely that eastern 
airlines will be sold off in pieces resulting in less than a fully 
integrated competitive carrier gingrich and campbell wrote 
skinner 
a copy of the letter was obtained by the associated press 
on thursday us rep glenn anderson chairman of the aviation 
subcommittee of the house public works and transportation committee 
announced that his panel will hold a hearing next week on easterns 
condition and the prospects for its restoration as a major 
carrier 
gingrich and campbell said they especially were concerned that 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo had an interest in not building up 
eastern as a competitor to continental airlines texas airs other 
main subsidiary 
we are troubled that mr lorenzo has more than one interest as 
he offers the piecemeal sale of eastern and no party before the 
bankruptcy judge represents the antitrust interest of the united 
states the letter read 
we respectfully request that you make this decision quickly as 
the assets of eastern are so rapidly being depleted that its 
viability as a competitor on any routes may soon be in question 
skinner hasnt responded to the letter dot spokesman hal paris 
said thursday 
miamibased eastern has been under bankruptcy protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the machinists union struck 
the carrier and was joined in the crippling walkout by pilots and 
flight attendants 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland so far has allowed 
eastern to sell its northeast shuttle service to developer donald 
trump for 365 million he also has approved easterns 2775 
million sale of 15 planes and six engines to an aircraft leasing 
company 
on thursday eastern announced a deal to sell the last three 
planes of its boeing 727100 fleet for 9 million to express one an 
aircraft company based in dallas the proposed sale still must be 
approved by lifland 
eastern also has reached agreement to sell its eight philadelphia 
gates 16 jets and other assets to midway airlines for 2065 
million skinner also has not approved that deal 
under skinner the department of transportation recently has 
taken several steps to discourage actions it sees as possibly 
inhibiting competition in the deregulated airline industry for 
example he has warned 28 us airlines that he would stop the 
buying and selling of international routes when it affects 
competition

orders for big ticket durable goods plunged 
42 percent in may the steepest drop in 10 months the government 
said today raising fears that if the decline persists factory 
workers will lose their jobs 
durable goods include a wide range of items from washing 
machines to warships expected to last three or more years 
economists closely track the orders as a measure of the health of 
the industrial sector and of the impact of interest rates on the 
economy persistent weakness is liable to lead to layoffs at 
manufacturing plants 
the plunge in may means fewer people will be needed to make 
things whether its planes or cars or washing machines said 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington mass 
however analysts were less alarmed by the may report than they 
would normally have been because orders had surged in april and 
because may was heavily influenced by a sharp decline in orders for 
aircraft and parts that still left that category at strong levels 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 1240 billion after climbing a revised 32 
percent in april and 10 percent in march the april increase had 
previously been estimated at 30 percent 
excluding the volatile transportation sector which swings widely 
from month to month orders fell 21 percent in may rose 45 
percent in april and climbed 26 percent in march 
analysts generally agree that the economy is slowing this year 
but there is considerable controversy over whether the growth will 
continue albeit sluggishly or whether the country will topple into 
a recession 
a variety of other government reports also indicate that the 
economy is slowing in response to the federal reserves yearlong 
campaign to fight inflation with higher interest rates recently in 
apparent reaction to the reports the fed permitted interest rates 
to drop slightly 
durablegoods orders now have fallen in three out of the last 
five months and their level remains 59 billion below the high of 
1321 billion in december 
it doesnt resolve the issue but i think these negative 
numbers certainly raise the specter of recession in peoples eyes 
and make them much more attuned to the possibility than before 
ms latta of data resources said 
although transportation orders in may showed the steepest drop 
94 percent orders were weak in the other sectors as well 
primary metals including steel dropped 15 percent electrical 
machinery was down 45 percent and nonelectrical machinery fell 34 
percent 
orders for military goods which also are very volatile dropped 
86 percent in may following a 182 percent plunge in april 
orders for nondefense capital goods considered a good barometer 
of business plans to expand and modernize fell 83 percent in may 
after rising 58 percent a month earlier it was the biggest decline

the united states has said it will introduce new 
legislation to reduce the tax on petroleum imports and lift a 
controversial customs surcharge a spokesman for the organization 
which sets world trade rules said friday 
investigation panels of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade ruled more than a year ago that the socalled tax and the 
customs user fee violated international trade law 
us deputy trade representative rufus yerxa told negotiators at 
a gatt council meeting that legislation was before the us congress 
to equalize treatment of imported and locally produced petroleum 
the gatt spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
this would amend a 1986 law which imposed a tax of 82 us cents 
on domestically produced petroleum and 117 cents on imported 
petroleum prompting complaints from canada mexico and the european 
economic community 
proceeds from the tax were intended for a superfund to 
finance a harzardous waste cleanup program 
yerxa also said the united states would modify a surcharge levied 
to cover import processing costs according to the spokesman who was 
at the closed meeting that ended late thursday night 
a gatt panel in 1987 backed a complaint by the european economic 
community and canada that the customs user fee of 017 percent of 
the value of the basic product was a trade barrier because it earned 
the united states more revenue than the real cost of import 
processing 
the gatt council meeting also agreed to give south korea more 
time to consider the findings of new panel reports against its 
restrictions on beef imports the gatt spokesman said 
in separate complaints raised by the united states australia and 
new zealand the investigation panels ruled at the end of april the 
restrictions on imports were not justified on balance of payment 
grounds 
under the rules of the 96nation trade organization less 
developed countries are allowed to keep import restrictions to 
protect their balance of payments

talk of looming power shortages and brownouts 
around the country has many people worrying about the problems those 
circumstances might cause 
but some financial analysts and stockmarket investors also are 
looking into who might stand to benefit acting on the timehonored 
wall street precept that every crisis contains an opportunity 
the electric power situation hasnt yet reached crisis 
proportions but as the merrill lynch market letter observes in a 
special report on the subject 
supplies of electricity are gradually tightening in many 
regions especially in new england on new yorks long island and in 
some midatlantic states 
the problem reflects unexpectedly strong demand in recent 
years operating difficulties that have forced some generating 
stations out of service and the reluctance of some local governments 
to allow completed plants to operate 
a team of analysts at ids financial services the big 
minneapolisbased money management firm asserts the united 
states faces the very real threat of a substantial shortage of 
electricity on a national scale by the mid1990s 
in most industries an investors response to such a forecast 
would be simple buy stocks of companies that own and produce the 
commodity or product in question 
but electric utilities are a special case since they lack the 
ability to set their prices simply on the basis of supplyanddemand 
market forces the rates they can charge are set by state regulators 
its unlikely that many utilities will benefit substantially 
from higher sales of electricity regulatory authorities often make 
it difficult for companies to keep extra profits says merrill 
lynch 
any gain in revenues and profits ids says is likely to occur at 
a utility that has a large reserve margin capacity to provide 
extra power at periods of peak demand utilities with tight reserve 
margins would be in a losing rather than winning position 
analysts say the story could be different however for other 
businesses that serve the electric utility industry in a variety of 
ways 
the solution to the problem of insufficient powergenerating 
capacity clearly is to build new power plants and transmission 
facilities merrill lynch says 
many utilities have begun to do just that some utilities are 
turning increasingly to comparatively small gasfired generating 
stations that can be put into service relatively quickly 
by idss reckoning if only half of the new powerplant 
capacity is gas fired electric utility demand for natural gas will 
be 60 percent higher than it was in 1988 
overall capital spending by the electric power industry in 
decline since the early 1980s is predicted to begin increasing in 
the years just ahead 
that suggests that companies in a number of fields including 
engineering and construction machinery and electrical equipment 
stand to benefit in the nottoodistant future merrill lynch says 
further out suppliers of fuel such as natural gas and 
lowsulfur coal could benefit once new or expanded power plants are 
in operation 
a special hazard in the search for companies that will prosper 
serving the power industry arises from the complicated 
environmental scientific and political questions involved 
nevertheless even assuming a recession or two and no dramatic 
increase in demand for energy ids analysts reckon that twice as 
much additional powerplant capacity will be needed by the year 2000 
as the electric industry currently estimates

the agreement filed by lawyers for tyson holly farms and 
conagra inc requires approval of the holly farms board of 
directors which is meeting in new york today said jim blair chief 
legal counsel for tyson 
it sets the stage for a threeparty settlement im cautiously 
optimistic blair said 
blair said the proposed agreement requires tyson to pay conagra 
50 million to withdraw from the bidding for holly farms the buyout 
will cost tyson about 14 billion blair said 
tyson has been trying to buy memphisbased holly farms since 
october while holly farms has been trying since november to merge 
with conagra based in omaha neb 
the springdale arkbased tyson raised its tender offer for 
holly farms stock to 70 a share tuesday and on thursday holly 
farms directors announced they had begun new talks with tyson and 
conagra 
the transaction being discussed would involve termination of 
the holly farms merger agreement with conagra settlement of all 
litigation between the parties and an acquisition of holly farms 
corp by tyson foods at 70 per share in cash a holly farms 
statement said 
directors of holly farms had rejected tysons previous offers and 
announced two merger attempts with conagra holly farms shareholders 
rejected the first attempt in april and holly farms announced the 
second one in may 
the latest merger proposal would have been accomplished through a 
stock swap worth about 68 a share to holly farms shareholders

million in damages 
john mcmillin a market analyst for prudentialbache in new york 
said tysons decision to raise its offer from 6350 to 70 may have 
made the difference in the takeover attempt

t boone pickens jr veteran of notorious but 
unsuccessful takeover attempts in the united states says theres 
nothing hostile about his investment in a japanese autoparts maker 
basically im trying to make money the texas oilman says 
but as far as koito manufacturing co is concerned this 
nottoriya takeover monger has taken his corporate raiding 
operations overseas 
it is hard to tell who is right but pickens latest venture into 
corporate confrontation may actually be part of a larger agenda one 
in which hes taking on the entire japanese way of doing business 
pickens and koito management will face each other thursday as 
koito convenes its annual meeting in tokyo theyve been bickering 
in the press since early april when pickens privately held boone 
co became koitos biggest shareholder by purchasing 202 percent of 
the manufacturers stock 
pickens major gripe so far has been koitos refusal to give 
boone co two seats on the companys board although the 
manufacturers secondlargest shareholder toyota motor corp 
which is seen as the real power behind koito has placed three 
directors there 
koito management already has said it wont address that issue at 
the meeting but pickens expects a showdown with koito anyhow 
because he wants to bring four people to the meeting and management 
has told him he can send just one representative and an interpreter 
sidney tassin a partner in boone co says pickens may be 
temporarily hamstrung by japanese law which restricts shareholder 
rights until a companys stock has been held by an owner for six 
months 
tassin indicated in an interview that when the six months are up 
and boone co has rights including the ability to call special 
meetings and to see some of koitos financial information pickens 
may be able to move more freely 
that may prove to be the first little test tassin said of 
the dispute over boone cos representatives at the meeting 
pickens is taking on and irritating koitos management in a 
way that harkens back to his past challenges to us companies 
including phillips petroleum co unocal corp and gulf corp 
the fact that boone co acquired its stake from a wellknown 
japanese raider kitaro watanabe has only served to heighten the 
suspicion of koito managers in late april the company demanded 
pickens prove that he and not watanabe was the true owner of the 
stake 
koito evidently believes pickens bought the shares hoping to 
drive up their price and force koito to buy them back at a premium 
above the market rate a practice known as greenmail 
pickens denied in an interview that hes ever been a corporate 
raider and said he isnt one now he said he wont try to take over 
koito because it wouldnt be feasible for him to try to operate a 
company in japan 
theres nothing hostile about the koito deal we just made an 
investment he said 
but his record is what makes koito wary 
pickens through his mesa limited partnership and its 
predecessor mesa petroleum co made millions of dollars from 
unsuccessful attempts on us companies some of his critics argued 
that pickens only went after phillips gulf and other companies to 
profit from his stock holdings which the firms usually bought back 
from mesa 
his association with watanabe who tried unsuccessfully last year 
to force koito to buy back his stake at a premium also cast doubt 
on pickens motives 
some observers in the japanese press speculated pickens might 
have an agreement to sell back his shares to watanabe so that both 
the japanese businessman and boone co would profit 
in his fight with koito pickens who is considering running for 
governor of texas is continuing a campaign waged through takeover 
battles and the advocacy group he founded united shareholders 
association a campaign to enforce what he calls shareholder rights 
and make management accountable 
but on a larger scale pickens said hes trying to force the 
japanese to open their markets which many foreigners complain are 
now virtually closed to american investors 
its extremely difficult to get a large participation or 
interest in a japanese company he said explaining that koito was 
the only company in which he could obtain a large stake 
they cant just play a oneway street thats just not the way 
life is pickens said theyre going to be forced to open up or 
theyre going to be forced to pull out 
pickens said he cant stop american investors and companies from 
selling their assets to the japanese but he said support is growing 
among americans and in washington for legislation that would force 
the japanese to relax their attitudes on foreign investment 
we may play a small part in this overall situation he said

japanese investors attracted by bargain 
properties and a dramatic increase in tourism here by their 
countrymen have spent or committed 800 million in this 
entertainment capital and its fueling an economic boom 
the projects range from four hotelcasinos to a downtown office 
building and a massive golf course and resort development 
more than 380000 japanese tourists are expected to visit las 
vegas this year vs about 300000 in 1988 that is not lost on some 
of japans leading economic players 
more than half the japanese tourists who come to los angeles 
will also come to las vegas said yoshi morichika who is heading 
up a 1274acre golf and destination resort community for japanese 
recreation and electronics giant cosmo world 
the project in nearby henderson will include 45 holes of golf 
2700 condominiums apartments and luxury homes a dozen tennis 
courts a tennis stadium and a 700room hotel 
cosmo world has projects in japan europe hawaii los angeles 
san francisco and tucson it added las vegas to the list because 
the land is not expensive yet and there is a huge volume of 
japanese tourists here morichika said in an interview 
jane wilson who handles international marketing for the las 
vegas convention and visitors authority says japanese tourism has 
been increasing at about 20 percent a year and is expected to jump 
about 27 percent this year 
if they come to the west coast were going to get them she 
said in their culture they want to go where a city is known 
worldwide where there are a lot of things to do such as shows 
shopping sightseeing et cetera 
the growing identity of las vegas in japan bargain real estate 
prices a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the city 
are proving a magnet for japanese investors the nevada development 
authority says las vegas is the sixthfastest growing metropolitan 
area in the united states 
cosmo worlds resort project is expected to cost 200 million by 
the time its completed in 1993 
japanese billionaire masao nangaku who bought the dunes hotel 
and casino two years ago for 157 million is planning a 35story 
highrise office building and 300room nongaming hotel in downtown 
las vegas the cost when completed in 1991 will be about 120 
million 
a group of japanese investors have agreed to help orlando fla 
developer bob snow finance a 130 million dining and entertainment 
complex known as winchester station snow is seeking a new site for 
the project because some landowners in downtown las vegas balked at 
selling their property 
japanese businessman katsuki manabe who owns more than 30 
arcades in tokyo has invested 30 million in the park hotel in 
downtown las vegas and millions more in his nevadabased sigma 
games a gaming equipment maker 
millionaire ginji yasuda has invested more than 120 million in 
the aladdin hotel 
the move by the japanese into the sophisticated gaming industry 
has not been smooth 
yasuda a highrolling gambler before he bought the aladdin has 
experienced financial problems at the resort in recent months 
forcing him to dig for sources to pay back taxes and some suppliers 
however one top nevada gaming source who asked not to be 
identified said yasudas license was up for reconsideration earlier 
this year and would not have been continued if he had not been 
able to meet his gaming obligations 
the same source said the japanese had taken over depressed 
properties and kept them open and any stride forward is a positive 
sign 
the dunes and aladdin had been operating under bankruptcy 
protection for years before they were purchased by nangaku and 
yasuda the park the former holiday inn downtown had been closed 
for five years before it was refurbished and opened by manabe 
mike rumbolz former gaming control board chairman who now heads 
donald trumps efforts to enter nevada gaming said the japanese 
were hampered because they bought distressed properties that 
couldnt make it under american expertise 
sukeaki izumi who owns five hotels in japan and guam recently 
purchased another closed property the former treasury hotel which 
he has renamed the san remo izumi who looked at properties in 
hawaii but opted for las vegas because of the lower costs has 
committed 30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel 
don woodsmall who serves with morichika as project manager of 
the cosmo world project said las vegas was picked by the japanese 
company in part because the housing market is so strong here 
representatives of the company began looking for land in late 
1987 and selected a site 10 minutes south of the las vegas strip 
work on the cosmo world project is scheduled to start in the 
first quarter of 1990 several major hotel chains have expressed an 
interest in running the resort morichika said 
izumi a millionaire industrialist became involved in the hotel 
business six years ago when he bought a property in osaka 
he switched his focus here he said because the city was 
smaller the cost of living was lower real estate prices were more 
attractive and he liked the way of life 
izumi moved to las vegas in december and plans to run the san 
remo personally the 324room europeanstyle property is scheduled 
to reopen july 1 izumi has plans for a 30 million 16story 
340room tower next year followed by a second tower and expansion 
of the casino 
when nangaku bought the dunes hotel two years ago his attorney 
predicted other japanese businessmen would follow 
they did 
this area is very attractive to the japanese businessman 
izumi said there is no other city like las vegas in the world

an important but often ignored consequence of 
mergers and takeovers in recent years has been a steady shrinkage in 
the amount of corporate stock available for trading 
it is just one of several important changes in the anatomy of the 
stock market that make it a very different beast than that of two 
decades ago 
in just five years from 1984 through 1988 a total of 369 
billion of us equities was removed from the trading arena an 
average of 74 billion a year in contrast to the previous 15 years 
when the total rose at 9 billion a year 
the figures obtained from wright investors service bridgeport 
conn show the trend has significantly reduced the variety of 
investment options and created a classic supplydemand imbalance 
that has tended to push up prices 
in wrights opinion the relative shortage of marketable equities 
is an important prop under the current level of stock prices still 
it adds that prop is not unshakeable and it forecasts a price 
decline later this year 
another fundamental change in the market has been the long 
evolution from individual to institutional ownership 
wrights figures show that the enormous growth of pension and 
mutual funds is not the sole reason for the dominance of 
institutions simultaneously it observes individual activity has 
been falling sharply 
in fact the wright analysis shows individual investors cashed in 
500 billion of blue chip stocks during the five years from 1984 
through 1988 in 1988 alone it says household stock holdings 
shrank by 105 billion and in the first quarter of 1989 the exodus 
rose to an annual rate of 157 billion 
for every sale there must be a buyer of course and in recent 
years the buyers have been institutions recent patterns of activity 
show however that unusual changes also have been occurring within 
the institutional body 
in the five years through 1988 for example equity mutual funds 
increased their holdings by 48 billion but last year they returned 
16 billion to the market and they continued to be sellers right 
through 1989s first quarter 
according to wright the only major sector which has consistently 
added to equity holdings of late is state and local government 
retirement funds in the five years through 1988 these funds were 
net buyers of 108 billion of stocks 
the reason why stocks in recent months seem to have fallen into 
disfavor isnt at all clear except for the likelihood that the 
yield on bonds convinced some portfolio managers that bonds were the 
better risk 
that explanation however doesnt help at all in clarfiying why 
portfolio managers for state and local government pension funds 
found equities attractive while their counterparts in privatesector 
funds were net sellers 
who then has been supporting the market wright concedes that 
foreign investors were important buyers during the price runup of 
the 1980s but even foreigners were sellers in the months following 
the late1987 market crash 
it isnt totally clear whether foreigners are still selling to 
this day or whether they have instead reverted to their old buying 
habits but in the first quarter they unloaded l6 billion of us 
equities 
while statistics such as these plenty of sellers but few buyers 
suggest a mysterious source of support for the current level of 
prices there is one prop that is delineated clearly and precisely 
it is this a growing supply of money and a shrinking supply of 
equities tend to exert an upward force on prices whether that force 
is sufficient to maintain current price levels however is not 
nearly so clear

gov gaston caperton today invited the 
heads of the pittston co the nations largest coal exporter and 
the miners union to the governors mansion to resume negotiations 
in a violent 2month strike 
only two parties can end this strike pittston and the united 
mine workers caperton said at a breakfast meeting of the national 
coal association convention at the greenbrier resort in white 
sulphur springs 
he asked umw president richard trumka and paul douglas chairman 
of the pittston co to resume negotiations monday about 1900 umw 
members have been on strike at pittston coal group mines in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky since april 5 over wage and 
benefit disputes 
pittston has declared an impasse in contract negotiations and has 
begun implementing its own contract at its operations neither the 
company nor the union immediately responded to the invitation 
wildcat walkouts in sympathy with the pittston strike began last 
week in west virginia and have spread to nine other states to 
include more than 43000 miners 
company efforts to obtain authorities help in getting wildcat 
strikers back to work have met with mixed success 
in ohio today about 100 miners returned to the saginaw mine near 
st clairsville after the company filed a complaint with the 
national labor relations board 
but in west virginia miners have defied several backtowork 
orders this morning us district judge dennis knapp met with 
lawyers for 13 companies seeking backtowork orders but postponed 
formal hearings on those requests and on five company motions that 
the union and its officials and members be held in contempt of court 
for ignoring his previous orders 
a group of community leaders and state legislators planned to ask 
knapp to remove himself claiming he is biased in favor of coal 
companies 
knapp on wednesday fined six umw locals their officers and 
members and ordered us marshals to serve pickets with copies of 
his order the fines will increase each day the locals officers and 
union members are in violation of the order 
striking miners in kentucky this morning overturned a jeep driven 
by a pittston mine manager one day after a strike sympathizer was 
grazed by a bullet at a west virginia mine 
more than 200 strikers surrounded the eastern coal corp office 
near stone ky this morning after rumors circulated that the 
companys mine would resume operations monday with replacement 
workers the workers who rolled a jeep onto its drivers side said 
they were trying to turn back the mine manager they later righted 
the jeep and the man drove off it was not immediately known if he 
was injured 
in johnstown pa roving pickets turned away about 600 united 
steelworkers members today at a bethlehem steel corp plant that 
makes railroad coal cars the company said 
the pickets were not identified they were presumed to be some of 
the estimated 6900 umw members off the job in pennsylvania 
virginia also appeared likely to become a focus of confrontation 
as pittston coal group president michael odom confirmed thursday 
that some salaried workers will be moved there from west virginia 
where the strike has crippled mines a union representative said the 
west virginia strikers would cross the state line to try to avert 
any use of replacement workers 
in us district court in clarksburg judge william kidd on 
thursday said he would rule soon on consolidation coal cos 
petition to force miners from six northcentral west virginia locals 
to return to work 
backtowork orders also are being sought by companies in alabama 
and pennsylvania and consolidation has said it plans to seek 
similar legal action in illinois and ohio 
the estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts 
according to union and industry officials are west virginia 
16000 illinois 8000 pennsylvania 6600 alabama 5000 ohio 
2660 kentucky 2325 indiana 1750 virginia 755 missouri

the house today sent to president bush an 
emergency spending bill that averts the threatened disruption of 
health care for veterans and other programs 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said were very 
pleased with the legislation and said bush looked forward to 
signing it 
the 35 billion fiscal 1989 supplemental appropriations bill 
approved by the senate thursday night passed the house 3186 
the emergency legislation was delayed for weeks mostly because 
of a battle over adding more money for antidrug programs 
in a compromise struck thursday house democrats dropped their 
plan to add 821 million for drug programs 
the white house had threatened to veto the bill if the drug money 
were included saying federal agencies already had all the money 
they could spend this year 
the new version would add just 75 million for the antidrug 
effort with that money coming from deferring spending on two other 
programs until fiscal 1990 the revised bill was cleared in meetings 
with white house budget director richard darman on thursday 
this could free up the logjam so the veterans programs and 
other funding emergencies can get their money said sen robert c 
byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
byrd said he contributed to the compromise by halving the bills 
allocation for one of his pet projects replacement of a 75 million 
radiotelescope in his home state delaying the rest of the money 
for that project until next year the rest of the money for the drug 
programs would come from deferring some agriculture spending 
on wednesday the house killed an earlier version of the bill 
which was opposed by republicans and conservative democrats anxious 
about leaving veterans programs threatened over the fourth of july 
holiday congressional leaders discussed a temporary bill to delay 
final action until next month but the white house balked at further 
delays 
under congressional rules the bill is supposed to provide money 
only for dire emergencies but it actually covers a broad swath 
of spending programs 
the largest single item is 12 billion for the department of 
veterans affairs to cover a shortfall in money for medical care 
compensation and pensions and in other areas 
thousands of veterans would be denied health care without the 
extra funding this year according to the administration 
the bill would add nearly 900 million to the federal guaranteed 
student loan program 342 million to cover the cost of fighting 
last years widespread forest fires and 423 million for foster 
care and adoption 
the food stamp program would be increased 225 million aid to 
the unemployed 90 million and refugee assistance 100 million

senate democrats today revised their childcare 
bill to add a provision sought by the white house but the 
administration said the package remained unacceptable and was a 
candidate for a veto by president bush 
an amendment approved 5445 added a third element to a 
taxcredit package that already includes upfront money to help poor 
families pay for child care and a new credit to help them pay for 
childrens health insurance 
the new element an expansion of the earned income tax credit for 
lowincome parents with children under age 5 was part of an 
alternative republican childcare package defeated thursday 
but republicans scoffed at the compromise effort led by sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the gesture was not enough to sway the administrations opposition 
to the bill a revised version of the act for better child care 
known as abc 
the abc bill in any combination is a candidate for a veto 
said fitzwater who did not say outright that bush would veto it 
bentsen angered that republicans would not accept his overture 
said the gop was refusing to give ground 
i offer this amendment in a spirit of compromise he said 
the president of the united states cant have it all 
their attempt at compromise spurned the senates majority 
democrats then moved to clear a long list of amendments in hopes of 
forcing a final vote on the package later today however approval 
of bentsens measure appeared likely to trigger lengthy debate on 
the amendments delaying the wrapup vote 
thursdays debate concluded just before midnight with senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine warning that a twoweek 
recess scheduled to begin today would be put on hold unless work on 
the childcare plan is finished 
many of the gop amendments adopted thursdsay made no major 
changes and were accepted by the sponsors of the legislation 
also winning approval were two amendments dealing with the 
earnings limit faced by certain social security recipients one 
exempted all childcare related earnings from the cap the other 
raised the cap by 1200 a year 
with house action on child care just beginning senate democrats 
say their proposal will now likely serve as the framework for the 
plan that ultimately clears congress 
republicans said that with action still on hold in the house the 
bush administration has time to seek further compromise 
gop lawmakers failed 5644 in their attempt to kill the 
democratic plan in favor of a white housebacked approach keyed to 
tax credits the senate then voted 6337 to accept the broader 
democratic plan in principle leaving the final vote until later 
republicans argued the democrats version would create new 
bureaucracies and limit parental choice because the legislation 
recommends that states adopt minimum standards for child care 
child care is a family issue senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas said its a family issue not a government issue 
but the principal author of the measure sen christopher dodd 
dconn said some state regulation of child care is necessary 
if your car and your pets are given certain protections by 
state licensing agencies we think your children deserve no less 
dodd said he also disputed the gop assertions about parental 
choice noting that 70 percent of the 175 billion in subsidies 
authorized for fiscal 1990 would have to be paid to parents 
in addition to the 175 billion subsidy authorization the 
democrats plan creates a new tax credit of up to 1000 to help 
lowincome parents buy health insurance for their children it also 
would make refundable in advance 90 percent of the existing 
dependent care tax credit a step designed to provide cash to 
lowincome parents who otherwise cannot take advantage of the 
credit bentsen said his revised taxrelief package still would cost 
the government about 105 billion over five years 
the defeated gop plan also allowed poor families to get the 
dependent care credit up front its other major element was the eitc 
expansion 
the amendment exempting childcare earnings from the social 
security earnings cap was sponsored by sen william roth rdel 
the other offered by bentsen increased the overall earnings 
limit currently applied to social security recipients age 65 to 69 
they lose 1 in benefits for every 2 in outside income over 8800 
the amendment would raise the earnings threshold to 10560 and 
lower the rate of benefits loss to 1 for every 4 earned

ever wonder where the money for your next house 
will come from now that the local savings and loan has plywood over 
its windows try japan 
japanese money is starting to flow into the immense 24 trillion 
residential mortgage loan market one of the few us investment 
opportunities it has not yet touched 
an invisible barrier to japanese money broke this past week with 
the announcement of a 575 million fund for foreigners mainly 
japanese to invest in mortgagebacked securities its called the 
blackstone fund for fannie mae mortgage securities 
last year the average fannie maeowned or guaranteed loan was 
less than 70000 so the new fund is good for financing mortgages 
on roughly 8000 american homes and thats just a start 
were confident these investors will have a very attractive 
return and thats only going to open the market for larger or more 
numerous funds of this type said robert nau jr a managing 
director of salomon brothers inc which sold the fund in japan 
the idea of borrowing japanese money to buy a home is bound to 
stir anxiety in some quarters but a closer look should quiet most 
of the qualms 
first decisions on loans and foreclosures if it comes to 
that are still made by local lenders subject to state laws 
second the influx of a new source of money for loans should at 
least slightly lower mortgage rates so people can buy better houses 
for the same amount of money 
its kind of tough because i think were all a little 
schizophrenic on those things we like the old building and loan 
idea from its a wonderful life said jayne shontell vice 
president for mortgagebacked securities capital market transactions 
at fannie mae 
still all of us want the lowest possible rate on our mortgage 
nostalgia is nice and hey i have antiques in my house but the 
typical consumer wants the best he can do financially and that 
means we have to enter the international market she said 
money follows a convoluted path from tokyo to the threebedroom 
on maple avenue this is how it works 
a home buyer gets a mortgage loan from the local savings and 
loan the sampl doesnt want to or cant afford to keep the loan on 
its books so it sells it to fannie mae the federal national 
mortgage association 
if fannie mae does not want to keep the loan on its own books it 
packages it with others in the form of a mortgagebacked security 
which trades on the open market 
blackstone financial management bought 575 million worth of the 
securities it is managing the new fund while the japanese 
investors for it were recruited by salomon and goldman sachs amp co 
fannie mae allowed its name to be used in the funds title but is 
not involved in the management 
the homeowners monthly mortgage payment goes from maple avenue 
to the sampl which is now merely a servicer of the loan to 
fannie mae to blackstone and finally across the pacific 
each middleman skims off some of the money but the yield is 
still better than investors can get in japan the land of 2 percent 
bank accounts 
the deregulation of the financial markets that made the 
blackstone fund possible had the unfortunate effect of forcing 
hundreds of savings and loans to board up their windows or more 
often disappear in shotgun weddings with healthier institutions 
the sampls were squeezed to death between the high rates they had 
to pay for deposits and the low rates they were able to charge on 
their mortgage loans but their loss was is the consumers gain 
before 1970 the average mortgage was 4 percentage points higher 
in yield than the average 10year treasury note that spread is down 
to 2 percentage points now and it may narrow further said laurence 
fink chairman and chief executive of blackstone financial 
management 
eventually japanese money may become as essential to financing 
american homes as it is to financing the us budget deficit and 
that will go on as long as the united states as a whole remains a 
borrowing nation 
if its the most aggressive way to help you afford the best 
house you can afford youre probably going to do it ms shontell 
said

texaco inc said friday it plans to 
retire almost 1 billion in debt securities ahead of scheduled 
maturity dates in a further effort to improve the companys 
financial footing 
texaco earlier this year completed a major financial 
restructuring including the sale of 7 billion in assets nearly a 
year after emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
the company has said it would use proceeds from the asset sales 
to reduce debt 
the following three debt issues are scheduled to be redeemed on 
aug 31 
500 million of 13 percent notes due aug 1 1991 issued by 
texaco capital inc to be redeemed at par plus accrued interest 
307 million of 11 percent convertible subordinated debentures 
due may 1 1994 issued by texaco capital nv to be redeemed at 
104 percent of the 1000 face value plus accrued interest 
159 million of 11 percent convertible subordinated debentures 
due may 15 1994 issued by texaco capital nv to be redeemed at 
104 percent of the 1000 face value plus accrued interest 
redemption of the 466 million in convertible subordinated 
debentures represents the final amount outstanding of 15 billion 
in those securities texaco issued in 1984 holders of the other 
1034 billion of similar issues previously had converted them into 
207 million shares of the companys stock texaco said 
early retirement of the corporate securities will further 
strengthen texacos financial position and improve profitability and 
shareholder value said company president james w kinnear 
as of the end of march 1989 texaco the third largest us oil 
company behind exxon corp and mobil corp had reduced its debt to 
71 billion from 108 billion in april 1988 the company said 
earlier this year that it hoped to cut it back to 65 billion by 
the end of the year 
texaco did not say how much it would save through the early 
retirement of the notes and bonds but indicated the savings would 
be pretty significant given the high interest rates 
this is whats behind it this is highcost debt said 
spokeswoman anita larsen

soybean futures prices closed with strong gains 
friday on the chicago board of trade amid fears that a producerled 
halt to brazilian soybean sales is beginning to squeeze supplies on 
the world market 
wheat and oat futures retreated while corn was narrowly mixed 
brazilian soybean growers stopped selling their crops to 
processors about two weeks ago to protest government economic 
policies 
now rumors are spreading that some brazilian soybean crushers 
will be forced to delay shipments of soybean meal and oil to their 
european trading partners 
if those shipments are delayed demand and prices for us 
soybeans are likely to rise 
it is very much an uncertainty said cathy leow an assistant 
vice president and grainmarket analyst with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york 
and because we dont have much stocks of oldcrop beans in 
midwest its a very explosive situation for the nearby contracts 
those for delivery in july and august 
at the close soybeans were 2 cents to 9 cents higher with july 
at 730 a bushel wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 397 a bushel corn was 3 cents 
lower to cent higher with july at 262 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 4 cents lower with july at 152 a bushel

the navy improperly restricted competition on a 
30 million computer contract by setting specifications that only 
allowed international business machines corp to bid says a 
congressional watchdog agency 
the general accounting office found that the service in a rush 
to meet a december 1988 deadline violated federal regulations when 
it specified ibm hardware and related equipment in soliciting for a 
payroll computer system 
the competition in contracting act and the federal acquisition 
regulation require that procurement specifications state only the 
governments actual needs and promote open competition 
the gao also found that the navy received a system design that 
did not meet its payroll needs 
the navys efforts to acquire the necessary hardware and 
software to support navscips the navy standard civilian pay system 
were not supported by sound technical decisions and did not promote 
full and open competition the gao concluded 
the agency which called the navys approach shortsighted 
recommended that the service cancel the contract with ibm rewrite 
the specifications and allow rebidding on the contract 
it is difficult for us to accept the notion that the december 
1988 deadline was so critical to the navys mission that it 
precluded following federal regulations and accepted systems 
development practices the agency said 
lt greg smith a navy spokesman said the service would reserve 
comment on the report until it saw a copy 
the gao found that the navy chose a data base management system 
hardware and 10 sites for the system without conducting 
appropriate studies and developing adequate support 
last year six computer companies complained to former defense 
secretary frank c carlucci that the navy was favoring ibm on a 
number of contracts 
rep james j florio dnj chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and 
competitiveness requested the gao report in december 1988

united steelworkers and inland steel co offers nearly 12000 union 
members an immediate bonus of 500 150 in base wage increases and 
higher incentive pay 
usw officials released the details of the fouryear pact friday

the next raise would come jan 1 1991 when base wages would 
increase by 50 cents and the incentive rate by 25 cents per hour 
a year later base wages would rise by 25 cents and the incentive 
rate by 50 cents per hour and on jan 1 1993 the only increase 
would be a 25 centperhour boost in the incentive rate 
the incentive system pays workers a portion typically 35 
percent of the incentive rate most inland workers are on incentive 
pay they will get the 150 base wage increase plus 35 cents of the 
1 hike in the incentive rate 
in addition inland is offering to restore the one week of 
vacation the workers gave up in the 1986 talks 
pensions will be improved so that the minimum payment for those 
with 30 years service will be 1000 
district 31 director jack parton who led the union negotiating 
team called the new pension plan the best in the steel industry 
inland originally wanted the right to schedule workers for a 
12hour work day parton said the company also wanted the employees 
to help pay medical insurance premiums both demands were withdrawn 
parton said 
the agreement was reached thursday in chicago

the securities and exchange commission and morgan 
stanley amp co declined comment friday about reports of an 
investigation into the investment firms trading practices during 
the 1987 stock market crash 
the wall street journal reported in its friday editions that the 
sec is investigating whether morgan stanley violated the shortsale 
rule which prevents short sellers from intentionally depressing a 
stock price 
selling short is the sale of borrowed stock by investors who 
believe the price of a stock will decline and that they will be able 
to profit by repaying their borrowings with cheaper shares 
the strategy is legal but trading rules prohibit short sales when 
a stock price already is falling 
lawrence iason head of the secs new york regional office 
refused to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation citing 
commission rules 
iason also declined to say whether any firms short sales during 
the crash were under investigation or even under review 
morgan stanley one of wall streets most prestigious firms was 
equally silent on the subject 
we dont comment on such matters said peter roche a morgan 
stanley spokesman 
last month salomon brothers inc was censured as part of a 
settlement with the sec about its own shortsale activities during 
the oct 19 1987 stock market crash salomon neither admitted nor 
denied guilt under the settlement 
at the time many on wall street suspected the sec was looking at 
similar activity by other investment firms 
according to the journal morgan stanley contends the government 
retroactively is trying to impose more a stringent method of 
counting stock positions at a given time 
many wall streeters have said privately that shortselling 
aggravated the spectacular drop in stock prices on black monday 
when the dow jones industrial average tumbled 508 points

the stock market rallied sharply to new 
postcrash highs today in buying encouraged by fresh evidence of a 
slowing economy 
the commerce department reported this morning that new factory 
orders for durable goods fell 42 percent in may wall street had 
been expecting them to be unchanged or slightly higher 
analysts saw the surprise decline as a sign that the economy 
might be slowing more dramatically than previously forecast 
that stirred some steppedup talk of a possible business slump 
but brokers said it also raised expectations of falling interest 
rates and reduced inflation 
in the credit markets prices of longterm government bonds 
soared about 15 for each 1000 in face value lowering their yield 
to the 818 percent823 percent range since early spring those 
bond interest rates have fallen more than a percentage point 
optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a 
weakening economy mounts the federal reserve will relax its credit 
policy to cushion the impact of the landing

united auto workers president owen bieber 
on friday moved the head of the unions ford department to 
leadership of the general motors department as part of a shuffle of 
vice presidents 
bieber announced the assignments after the 1 millionmember 
unions weeklong triennial constitutional convention ended with the 
delegates approval of a 135page book of resolutions on labor 
social and political issues 
bieber said vice president stephen yokich would move from 
directing the unions ford department to the gm department 
succeeding retired vice president donald ephlin succeeding yokich 
will be newly elected vice president ernie lofton 
another new vice president stan marshall will take over the 
unions chrysler department following marc stepp who also retired 
vice president odessa kommer the unions most senior vice 
president will remain in charge of a variety of smaller departments 
each of the assignments was expected 
in addition to the general assigments yokich will be responsible 
for the skilled trades department marshall also will take over 
direction of the unions organizing efforts a task previously 
handled by yokich 
i think we had a tremendous convention bieber said i 
think we go out of this convention very strong and united 
the union still is hearing the strongest voices of internal 
dissent since walter reuther solidified his contol of the uaw in the 
mid1930s 
the new directions movement has proved to be a thorn in biebers 
political side loudly opposing many of his efforts including 
establishment of joint labormanagement programs in factories 
despite the opposition bieber called the convention a huge 
political success 
new directions never had the support of more than 20 percent of 
the delegates as it lost each of its major convention battles but 
the movement has vowed to become better organized and to return 
stronger when the uaw holds its next constitutional convention in 
1992 at a site yet to be chosen

holly farms corps directors on friday 
accepted rival tyson foods incs 14 billion buyout offer and 
agreed to pay conagra inc to drop out of the bidding 
under terms of the agreement conagra will receive 50 million to 
end a previous merger pact with holly farms the memphisbased 
poultry processor will pay a 20 million termination fee conagra 
will receive the remaining 30 million when tyson completes its 
purchase of holly farms stock 
its a done deal said jim blair chief legal counsel 
springdale arkbased tyson of the 70ashare cash offer 
the settlement boosted conagra stock 225 a share to 3625 in 
new york stock exchange trading holly farms finished at 6925 up 
25 cents a share on the big board tyson was unchanged at 1825 in 
overthecounter trading 
tyson the nations largest poultry processor began what erupted 
into a bidding war over holly farms in october when it offered to 
acquire the company for 49 a share in cash and securities 
in resisting tysons advances holly farms announced two attempts 
to merge with conagra of omaha neb 
the latest holly farmsconagra agreement which was expected to 
go before shareholders next month was based on a stock swap valued 
at 13 billion or 68 a share 
tyson played the game to win they put out a number that left 
hollys board with no other choice but to accept said john 
mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york it was a marriage not of choice by hollys board but of 
necessity 
tyson holly farms and conagra also agreed to terminate all 
litigation among the companies tyson had filed suit in delaware 
where holly farms is incorporated accusing the company of wrongly 
favoring conagra at tysons expense tyson has asked for 500 
million in damages 
the holly farms board also disolved its shareholders rights plan 
or poison pill aimed at fending off hostile bidders by making an 
unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive 
a delaware chancery court approved the agreement among the three 
companies shortly before the holly farms board accepted tysons bid 
we are pleased that the situation has finally been resolved and 
believe that we have an agreement that we can strongly recommend to 
our stockholders holly farms president r lee taylor said in a 
statement 
holly farms has 181 million outstanding common shares but the 
70ashare purchase will total 14 billion on a fully diluted 
basis when shares held as bonds are converted blair said 
it will ultimately be a merger but it continues as a tender 
offer he said we will close our tender offer off and then if 
we need a shareholder vote we will be a majority of the shares 
tyson foods processes more than 165 million chickens a week and 
holly farms is a diversified company heavily involved in the sale of 
fresh fryers conagra is a diversified company specializing in food 
and agricultural services 
charles m harper conagras chief executive officer said his 
company was unwilling to meet tysons latest bid 
a higher bid would have taken us past the point where we were 
confident a merger would meet conagras demanding financial 
standards harper said in a statement

two companies teetering under the weight of 
burdensome debt loads got crutches this past week to support their 
financial footing 
the severity and causes of the difficulties confronting hooker 
corp and integrated resources inc differ but in both cases the 
prospect for survival is uncertain and the companies must swallow 
some stiff medicine if they are to pull through 
cashstrapped hooker an australian property and retail concern 
that owns department stores and shopping centers in the united 
states tentatively won a loan repayment reprieve from its bankers 
on friday the banks also agreed to keep credit lines open 
to persuade its lenders to go along with a temporary halt on 
repaying principal on its loans hooker had to hand over power to 
them giving the banks a say in its debtreduction scheme 
five of hookers major lenders will work with the company and its 
financial advisor on a program of asset sales and other measures to 
prune debt that has grown to 15 billion 
among the assets put up for sale are the forest fair mall in 
cincinnati the richland fashion mall in columbia sc and thornton 
town center outside denver investment partners are being sought to 
take stakes in hookers department stores including b altman amp co 
bonwit teller sakowitz and parisian and in its planned shopping 
center developments 
hooker chairman george herscu who owns 53 percent of the 
company did not attend the meeting with hooker and its bankers in 
sydney australia friday his absence stirred speculation about his 
future role at hooker 
under herscus direction hooker became a presence in the 
american retailing scene by snapping up strings of established 
stores and extending them into malls that hooker built 
the company mainly blames high australian interest rates which 
hurt real estate operations in that country for causing its current 
cash crunch a condition hooker says is temporary sluggish retail 
sales in the united states also have contributed to its troubles 
hooker says 
but retail industry analysts say hookers wounds are partially 
selfinflicted and may be slow to heal 
in developing shopping sites the company has paid too much 
attention to realestate ambitions and not enough to basic 
merchandising considerations analysts say stores were opened where 
they werent needed and upscale stores were brought to areas in 
which inhabitants were more at home in discounters 
during hookers convalescence the company may be rethinking its 
philosophy of linking property development to retail expansion 
analysts say 
integrated resources which transformed itself from the nations 
biggest seller of tax shelter investments into a financial services 
company after the 1986 tax revisions rendered its business virtually 
useless also is doing some selfexamination 
after a sudden threat of disintegration due to a cash shortage 
integrated started pulling itself together last week and announced a 
major overhaul of its operations and measures to cope with its 
liquidity needs 
a lack of liquidity had caused the company to default on 955 
million in debt setting in motion a scramble to steer clear of 
bankruptcy court 
the company now is eplacing shortterm debt with fresh 
borrowings has pledged almost all of its 78 billion in assets as 
collateral on the new borrowing and intends to curtail operations 
and to slash operating expenses by 40 million a year 
arthur goldberg integrateds president said the steps should 
allow the company to continue as a viable player in financial 
services 
wall street apparently has its doubts integrated stock was still 
languishing late friday at around 6 a share down from about 15 a 
week earlier and 40 in 1986 
integrated may be heading for another reincarnation 
texas investor robert bass reportedly is attracted to 
integrateds network of financial consultants who sell investments 
ranging from insurance to real estate a bassled group may be 
willing to pump muchneeded funds into integrated if they could

eastern airlines maintenance system has failed 
to make needed repairs to malfunctioning aircraft equipment even 
after repeated complaints by pilots according to a team of 
investigators from the federal aviation administration 
in a brief statement friday the department of transportation 
said the faa team has discovered numerous examples of chronic 
failure to correct equipment deficiencies at the strikebound 
carriers miami and atlanta bases 
the results indicate that management personnel were allowing 
aircraft to be moved without adequate corrective action joseph 
doubleday the faa inspection team leader wrote in a june 7 report 
to faa official roger v gordon we feel this was driven in part 
by the intense pressure to meet ontime performance goals of a 
special incentive program 
a copy of doubledays report was obtained by the associated press 
eastern disputes the faas findings in a detailed sixpage 
letter to gordon sent on thursday john j keyser easterns vice 
president for regulatory compliance said doubledays report lacks 
needed perspective 
gordon the faa manager with lead responsibility for eastern was 
on vacation and was unavailable for comment friday 
easterns unions and others have raised questions about 
maintenance and safety at the miamibased airline which has 
weathered a crippling strike and a bankruptcy filing since early 
march 
early last month eastern temporarily surrendered its repair 
station certificate at new yorks john f kennedy international 
airport after the faa determined the carrier had failed to follow 
its system for recording and inspecting maintenance work 
soon after the jfk certificate was pulled the faa sent doubleday 
and nine other inspectors to easterns main base in miami to 
determine if widespread violations of maintenance recordkeeping 
rules such as those found in new york existed in miami and atlanta 
jfk miami international and atlantas hartsfield international 
are the sites of easterns three principal maintenance facilities 
most of the atlanta records eventually are sent to miami 
doubledays report said the miami investigation did not find 
fraudulent or forged maintenance documentation as a systemic 
problem 
however he said the team which reviewed records for 29 planes 
from january 1988 through may 1989 discovered problems with 
easterns continuing analysis and surveillance system those 
problems led to chronic failure to repair deficiencies reported by 
pilots the report said 
the report cites 30 examples of repairs that werent made on 
different aircraft despite repeated reports the affected equipment 
included automatic landing devices fire warning signals engine 
gauges altitude alert systems and windshield wipers 
in some cases doubledays team said several inappropriate 
corrective actions were taken one example involved an engine 
brake on a lockheed l1011 tristar that was found to be inoperative 
or slow to operate on landing maintenance managers failed to note 
the problem 17 times according to the report 
easterns unions have accused the company of pencilwhipping 
a reference to maintenance supervisors signing off on aircraft 
repairs that werent done 
although the faa inspection covered a period both before and 
during the eastern strike it is significant that all of the 
discrepancies listed in the report related to prestrike 
activities keyser wrote in his letter to gordon 
the new mechanics and pilots hired by eastern during the strike 
have brought a new cooperative spirit and a cultural change 
in the workforce which have meant fewer problems keyser said 
the airline has been largely grounded since the strike started 
march 4 operating only around 10 percent of its normal schedule of 
1040 flights daily 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation recently 
expressed concern to acting faa administrator robert e whittington 
that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering easterns 
ability to maintain its fleet

as they survey the financial scene approaching 
midyear many analysts say the stock market is likely to have a 
tough time duplicating its firsthalf performance over the remainder 
of 1989 
by various measures the market has risen 15 to 20 percent since 
the start of the year an advance of similar proportions from its 
current levels would take the dow jones average of 30 industrials to 
the 28503000 range 
while such a feat is certainly not impossible analysts say it 
is a lot to expect especially considering all the things that 
already have gone in the markets favor this year 
the best and easiest money is definitely behind us asserts 
joseph feshbach technical analyst at prudentialbache securities 
in its midyear forecast standard amp poors weekly publication the 
outlook says were looking for further gains this isnt 
however a market thats likely to run away on the upside 
lately just about everything has been breaking the right way 
that cant continue very much longer 
what could happen to stifle enthusiasm for stocks for one thing 
analysts say hopes for a soft landing a benign slowing of 
economic growth could give way to fears of recession 
alternatively some observers say the soft landing could occur 
as expected but investors could wind up feeling sorry that they got 
what they wished for 
you do not need a recession to get a decline in profits 
observes thomas doerflinger at painewebber inc even a soft 
landing for the gross national product can be a hard landing for 
profits 
if the probability of earnings disappointments is high in the 
second half of this year it is still higher next year 
in the past week investors demonstrated that they still see 
evidence of a weakening economy in a favorable light 
spurred on by word of an unexpected decline in durable goods 
orders for may the dow jones industrial average rose 4549 points 
during the week to a postcrash high of 253187 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 327 to 
18286 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 115 to 44836 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 242 at 36425 
volume on the big board averaged 16849 million shares a day 
down from 18217 million the week before 
as described by james grant editor of the newsletter grants 
interest rate observer and a noted bear on the financial outlook 
the recent case of integrated resources inc illustrates a dangerous 
complacency and vulnerability to unpleasant surprises in the stock 
and credit markets 
integrateds securities plunged in price on the news that the 
real estate and financial services company had run out of credit 
the latest published list of integrateds shareholders as of 
march 31 included some prominent mutual funds and money management 
firms 
many are the lessons of integrated resources grant wrote 
to start with even the most successful and celebrated investors 
can fall asleep at the switch 
the poleaxing of the integrated capitalization is a reminder 
that when disaster strikes it strikes fast 
perhaps the foremost lesson of the integrated crackup is that 
faith runs deep grant added noting that the news of it seemed to 
have few ripple effects in the highyield junk bond market or in 
the market for lowrated and unrated commercial paper a form of 
shortterm ious issued by companies 
for the time being grant concluded institutional 
investors continue to believe that every day is the first day of 
spring

gold prices posted gains in the united states after a mixed 
performance overseas republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid of 377 for a troy ounce of gold bullion at 4 pm edt up from 
thursdays late bid of 37025 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar has been sagging due to 
a lack of interest in buying the american currency at a time when 
central banks seem determined to keep it from moving significantly 
higher 
central banks stepped into the market several times during the 
week and sold dollars pushing it down 
much of the intervention was aimed at supporting the beleaguered 
british pound currency dealers have dumped sterling lately as 
britains economic difficulties including strikes by various labor 
unions have eroded confidence in the currency 
traders seemed to be selling dollars friday in anticipation of 
possible dollar declines in asian trading over the weekend analysts 
said 
the markets paid little attention to a commerce department report 
that showed orders for durable goods expensive items that have a 
lifespan of at least several years plunged 42 percent in may 
traders said implications of the drop were uncertain because durable 
goods estimates are frequently revised 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14035 japanese yen down from 
14140 in london late friday the dollar traded lower at 13850 yen 
and it ended in new york at 13885 yen down from 13930 thursday

gold prices rose sharply in new york and london but edged lower 
in zurich

buy too many more 
in addition interest rates are higher and employment growth 
slower than at this time last year said analyst harvey heinbach of

39392 during the period down from a rate of 43682 a day in the

were down 14 percent from last year 
ford had the greatest decline in car sales and gm the greatest 
slowdown in truck sales among the big three automakers

average daily rate of 7197 this year from 8356 last year fords 
light truck sales for the period were down 6 percent

gold futures prices surged more than 7 a troy ounce friday on 
new yorks commodity exchange capping that markets biggest weekly 
move in nine months 
analysts cited the dollars pronounced weakness as a major factor 
in the rally which boosted the spot price of an ounce of gold by 
1340 in five days to 37850 
silver and platinum futures prices also advanced 
on other markets friday soybean and petroleum futures rose 
strongly while livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold settled 710 to 760 higher with the contract for spot 
delivery at 37850 a troy ounce and the more actively traded august 
contract at 38180 silver was 27 cents to 38 cents higher with 
july at 5338 a troy ounce 
on the new york mercantile exchange platinum futures settled 
1290 to 1410 higher with july at 51660 a troy ounce a 
sixweek high 
gold prices have not made as large a weekly move since the week 
of sept 19 when prices dropped about 18 an ounce 
this was some of the best action weve seen in a long time a 
really nice finish to a nice week said craig sloane a metals 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
because gold is denominated in dollars on the world market a 
weakening of the dollars value against other major currencies makes 
gold cheaper overseas which encourages foreign buying 
a weaker dollar also makes us goods cheaper overseas which can 
boost orders to us manufacturers potentially contributing to 
inflation gold is perceived as an investment hedge against 
inflation 
fridays rally followed a gain of more than 6 in the gold market 
on wednesday and pushed prices through some key points of 
psychological resistance which analysts took as a bullish sign 
soybean futures posted strong gains on the chicago board of trade 
amid fears of a global supply squeeze wrought by a producerled halt 
to brazilian soybean sales 
wheat and oat futures retreated while corn was narrowly mixed 
brazilian soybean growers stopped selling their crops to 
processors about two weeks ago to protest their governments 
economic policies 
now rumors are spreading that some brazilian soybean crushers 
will be forced to delay shipments of soybean meal and oil to their 
european trading partners 
if those shipments are delayed demand and prices for us 
soybeans are likely to rise 
soybeans settled 1 cent to 9 cents higher with july at 731 a 
bushel wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with july at 397 a 
bushel corn was 3 cents lower to cent higher with july at 262 
a bushel oats were 4 cents to 4 cents lower with july at 152 a 
bushel 
a reported reduction in north sea crudeoil production helped to 
boost energy futures prices on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 41 cents 
higher with august at 1971 a barrel heating oil was 87 cent to 
101 cents higher with july at 4949 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 118 cents to 193 cents higher with july at 6292 
cents a gallon 
livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in subdued trading ahead of the agriculture 
departments monthly cold storage report 
the report showed 1438 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in 
public warehouses as of june 1 well below the average prereport 
estimate of 1478 million pounds analysts said porkbelly futures 
may open higher monday in reaction to the surprising report 
live cattle were 10 cent to 48 cent lower with august at 6987 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with august at 8112 cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent lower to 
47 cent higher with july at 4967 cents a pound frozen pork

jh whitney amp co the nations oldest venture 
capital firm said friday it has agreed to buy prime computer inc 
in a friendly merger valued at about 125 billion 
prime a minicomputer maker based in natick had been searching 
for a white knight to ward off a 113 billion hostile bid from 
mai basic four inc of tustin calif 
primes board of directors unanimously approved the merger with 
whitney but mai said it was preparing to boost its offer raising 
the possibility of a bidding war that could sink the deal 
whitneys announcement sent primes stock soaring on the new york 
stock exchange it closed at 19 a share up 312 mais stock 
dropped to 625 down 12 cents 
the merger would be the largest single investment ever for 
whitney a private new york firm founded in 1946 by wealthy 
industrialist john hay whitney said don e ackerman a general 
partner in the firm 
whitney said it would pay 2150 a share in cash for 79 percent 
of primes common stock the remaining 21 percent would be exchanged 
for bonds with a face value of 22 a share and an interest rate of 
155 percent 
since the bonds are likely to trade at less than face value wall 
street securities analysts estimated the blended value of the offer 
at 20 a share or 125 billion prime has 626 million shares of 
common stock on a fully diluted basis 
mai originally had offered 20 a share for prime last november 
on june 1 however mai chairman bennett s lebow announced a cut in 
its offer to 1950 in cash for the outstanding shares plus a 
mixture of securities with a face value of 21 a share for the 
remaining stock 
analysts have valued mais offer at about 18 a share or 113 
billion but some expect it to rise 
is it too late for mai to top this one presumably not 
youre in an auction mode said john w adams who follows prime 
for the boston investment firm of adams harkness amp hill 
barry f willman an analyst with sanford c bernstein amp co in 
new york said the eightmonth takeover battle has scared away 
customers and depressed primes earnings 
the longer this drags on the more the value of the asset the 
company declines willman said mai is going to have to take a 
good hard look at whether continuing to pursue this is in its best 
interest 
mai and prime had been heading for a showdown at primes july 26 
annual meeting when mai said it would wage a proxy battle for 
control of the board of directors 
mai spokesman toni lee said friday it would have no immediate 
comment on the primewhitney agreement 
whitney said shearson lehman hutton holdings inc agreed to 
provide 460 million of bridge financing for the merger while 
whitney and shearson together have committed 200 million of equity 
and debt 
two leading banks chemical bank and the first national bank of 
boston also have agreed to put up 600 million of financing 
whitney said 
ackerman the whitney partner said it would operate prime as an 
independent entity and did not plan to sell any operations to repay 
debt incurred in the buyout 
one of whitneys 10 general partners russell planitzer was 
primes treasurer from the early 1970s until 1980 when he joined 
whitney as a result ackerman said we know prime very well and 
we certainly thought it was undervalued at the price lebow 
offered 
prime makes minicomputers and is the second largest producer of 
computer aided design and manufacturing systems surpassed only by 
international business machines corp it has 11200 employees and 
had 1988 sales of 16 billion

congressmen from all 50 states asked the 
us department of agriculture friday to buy nearly 5 million boxes 
of apples to help cut a huge surplus created by the alar controversy 
the request came in a letter signed by 114 members of the house 
of representatives to agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
us rep sid morrison rwash who represents a region growing 
half the nations apples 
apple industry estimates show that some 5 million to 7 million 
boxes of apples valued at between 40 million and 56 million in the 
current depressed market are now stalled in the worlds distribution 
pipeline as a result of the scare morrison said 
the natural resources defense council a private group issued a 
report in february saying eating apples treated with the chemical 
growth regulator alar increased cancer risk in children 
the reports findings have been disputed but the federal 
government announced plans to ban alar and consumer sales fell 
an agriculture department program allows the emergency purchase 
of 350 million to 500 million in farm products yeutter is being 
asked to dip into that fund to bail out the nations 20000 apple 
growers who have estimated losses of well over 100 million in 
sales as a result of the scare 
the government could give the surplus apples to schools prisons 
and public assistance feeding programs said morrison they could 
also be used for production of ethanol or cattle feed he said 
an agriculture department spokesman in washington dc clarence 
steinberg said the agency has not discussed how it will respond to

for alleged accounting improprieties 
the companys stock sunk 1 to close friday at 2412 a share in 
composite new york stock exchange trading on the news

the investigation was prompted by disgruntled former employees who 
were recently terminated by the company 
the company said in a statement that it is cooperating with the 
sec but maintained that its recently audited financial statements 
are proper 
there are certain alleged accounting improprieties golden 
valley spokesman curt swenson said we cant comment beyond that 
the sec also would not comment 
usa today without revealing its sources reported friday that 
the investigation centers on allegations the company fabricated 
some of its revenues thus creating phony earnings 
the newspaper also said the sec is investigating whether some 
company officers used company funds for personal expenses 
swenson said the company had no comment on the story 
in the third quarter of 1988 golden valley microwave booked 33 
percent increases in sales and earnings sales jumped to 329 
million from 247 million and profits increased to 36 cents a share

paramount communications inc on friday boosted 
by 15 billion to 122 billion its hostile takeover offer for 
media giant time inc which is pursuing its own bid for warner 
communications inc 
paramount which indicated in making its initial 175ashare 
offer for time earlier this month that it was open to raising the 
offer said it had sweetened its cash bid to 200 a share 
in a letter to time chairman and chief executive j richard 
munro paramounts chairman and chief executive martin s davis 
renewed his request for a meeting to address any concerns you 
might have and to negotiate all aspects of our proposal 
time which rejected paramounts earlier 107 billion takeover 
bid issued a statement saying the time board will consider 
paramounts increased tender offer in due course 
time inc advises its shareholders not to act on the offer 
until they hear from time the statement read 
but securities analysts said the new offer increases the pressure 
on time to devise something that can provide its shareholders with 
value that comes close to matching paramounts allcash offer 
time has launched its own 14 billion bid for warner 
paramount made its announcement shortly after the stock market 
closed but time stock already had rocketed higher on speculation 
about the possibility that paramount would raise its bid 
in trading on the new york stock exchange time rose 1050 a 
share to 16587 paramount was down 50 cents a share at 58 and 
warner was off 50 cents a share to 5862 
the sweetened offer for time follows a week in which paramount 
and time swapped increasingly bitter charges in state and federal 
courts in an effort to stop each others takeover bids 
many analysts are looking to a scheduled july 11 hearing in 
delaware chancery court as a potentially pivotal date in the fight 
for time paramount said it intends to extend its offer until the 
delaware court rules on its motion to block times buyout of warner 
time rejected paramounts previous bid a week ago as inadequate 
and highly conditional at the same time it revised its earlier 
plan to merge with warner in a stock swap and instead launched a 
70ashare bid for warner 
the move has angered some time shareholders who would have been 
allowed to vote on the planned stock swap merger with warner but are 
not being asked to vote on the time buyout of the record film and 
cable concern 
time argues that a combination with warner which would create 
the worlds biggest communications concern eventually would be 
worth much more than the upfront cash payment paramount is offering 
in his letter to munro davis said he hoped the time board and 
management will now discontinue your efforts to preclude 
stockholder choice and give times shareholders an opportunity to 
consider our offer 
j kendrick noble a media analyst for the securities firm 
painewebber said the new offer for time does put the pressure on 
time 
he said the company could still conclude the paramount bid was 
inadequate but may have to work up a new plan in connection with 
the warner buyout to give disgruntled shareholders something 
matching the price paramount is offering 
its possible they can work out something else noble said 
but added it was tough to assess the outcome 
paramount said its offer remained subject to several conditions 
including the obtaining of financing termination of the warner 
offer and rescinding a stock swap in which time and warner gave 
additional new shares to each other 
paramount estimated it will need 156 billion in financing for 
the new offer including 122 billion simply to buy the stock 
it said citibank had agreed to provide 1 billion in financing 
and was highly confident it could arrange a syndicate of bank 
lenders to provide an additional 13 billion 
morgan stanley amp co has said it could arrange the placement of 
an addtional 16 billion in subordinated securities paramount said 
despite all the rhetoric all the talk of war and rockets 
we continue to believe that if we work together we can structure a 
transaction that will be in the best interests of both of our 
companies and their stockholders davis wrote

consumer spending and income growth both slowed 
in may to a lackluster 03 percent the slowest pace since the fall 
the government said friday in another indication the economy is 
losing steam 
consumer spending represents twothirds of the us economy and 
analysts closely monitor fluctations in both spending and income as 
a barometer of the economys overall health 
the gain in americans income to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 439 trillion was the slowest since september the commerce 
department said the rise in personal consumer spending to an annual 
rate of 344 trillion was the weakest since october 
if the rising cost of living is factored out both spending and 
income actually declined in may economist allen sinai of the boston 
co called the report almost recessionlike 
consumer spending adjusted for inflation normally keeps going 
up so this is very weak he said 
however economic consultant michael k evans of washington said 
spending growth had paused temporarily because consumers were forced 
to pay higherthanexpected tax bills in april and higher gasoline 
and food prices in april and may 
the average consumer got hit by a onetwo punch he said i 
think consumer spending will come back cautiously in the third 
quarter if i didnt id be predicting a recession 
the may income boost followed stronger gains of 05 percent in 
april and 09 percent in march however the commerce department 
noted that the march rise was inflated by two special factors 
profitsharing payments to auto workers and retroactive social 
security checks that made the april increase look smaller 
april was also held back by a dip in farm payments and that in 
turn made the small may rise appear larger 
if you take those numbers together personal income is still 
moving up but at a more sedate pace were looking at an economy 
that is slowing which is what the federal reserve wanted said 
economist lyle gramley of the mortgage bankers association of 
america 
the fed has been fighting inflation with higher interest rates 
since march 1988 it recently has allowed rates to come down a bit 
gramley a former fed member said fridays report likely 
wouldnt cause the central bank to ease further now but he said the 
fed may loosen its grip on credit another notch in a week or two 
disposable or aftertax income surged 14 percent in may after 
falling 07 percent in april tax payments took a 
largerthanexpected bite out of income in april and returned to a 
more normal level in may 
the personal savings rate representing the percentage of 
aftertax income saved by americans rose to 53 percent in may from 
43 percent in april 
the savings rate has been averaging about 51 percent this year 
up from 42 percent last year and a historic low of 32 percent in 
1987 analysts believe the rising savings rate this year indicates 
consumers are becoming more cautious 
before rising a weak 03 percent last month personal consumption 
spending which includes everything except interest on debt had 
surged 11 percent in april and risen 04 percent in march 
the commerce department said much of the may weakness and april 
strength was accounted for by swings in auto buying which have been 
influenced by introduction of manufacturers incentives in april and 
their partial rescission in may 
spending on durable goods bigticket items including autos fell 
15 percent last month to an annual rate of 4657 billion after 
rising 44 percent in april

quaker oats co announced friday that a federal 
agency has determined ads touting its oat bran and oatbran products 
as an aid in reducing blood cholesterol levels are neither 
misleading nor illegal 
after a yearlong investigation of the quaker ads the federal 
trade commission ruled that consumers understand that oatbran 
products can help cut cholesterol as part of a lowfat 
lowcholesterol diet 
the probe was prompted by a complaint from the center for science 
in the public interest in washington dc which contended quakers 
ad campaign was misleading because it implied that cholesterol 
levels could be reduced solely be eating quaker oats 
the ads in question say 
in recent clinical studies where quaker oats were a daily part 
of a lowfat low cholesterol diet total serum cholesterol levels 
dropped on average almost 10 percent many experts believe it is 
the soluble fiber in oats that does it and scientists are finding 
that oats are one of the best sources of soluble fiber you can get 
the center also questioned the use of almost 10 percent to 
describe cholesterol reductions saying the study from which the 
quaker got its information indicated the reduction averaged 87 
percent 
but william macleod director of the ftcs consumer protection 
bureau wrote that the agency concluded that consumers who view the 
advertising would attribute the reduction to a lowfat diet 
including quaker oats 
in a letter to the center mcleod said this conclusion is 
based on the actual reactions of consumers as well as our analysis 
of the ads themselves therefore we do not believe that the 
evidence would support the conclusions in your petition 
r thomas howell general counsel for chicagobased quaker said 
it has been our policy that any healthrelated advertising claims 
should be truthful not misleading and supported by valid reliable 
scientific evidence 
howell said quaker supplied documentation on 10 studies conducted 
during the past 25 years that show the positive effects of oats and 
oat products 
despite the ftc finding quaker has advised the commission that 
they nonetheless plan to clarify the ads that prompted your 
petition macleod said in a letter to the center 
bruce silverglade the centers director of legal affairs said 
while the organization was pleased the company has voluntarily 
modified the ads we still encourage state attorneys general who 
are investigating the same advertising campaign to take official 
action against quaker 
the federal government is no longer the last word on these 
matters silverglade said 
he said until such changes are legally required companies 
often revert to the original ads in a few months time

the senate on friday passed a 
multibilliondollar childcare plan but the bush administration 
labeled it a candidate for a veto despite democratic compromises 
to accommodate the president 
the voice vote sent to the house a partisan fight over child 
care with democrats and republicans alike jockeying for credit on 
an issue both parties have made a priority 
overall the senate package with its 175 billion in direct 
subsidies for the fiscal year beginning oct 1and about 3 billion a 
year in tax credits represents the greatest government effort to 
address childcare needs of working parents since an emergency plan 
adopted during world war ii 
when gop senators and the white house scoffed friday morning at a 
democratic compromise it appeared a lengthy battle over amendments 
was in store 
but republicans acknowledged their inability to muster enough 
votes to defeat the majority democrats and relented by midafternoon 
to reach agreement on a timetable that allowed for the final vote in 
time for senators to leave town to begin a twoweek recess 
action on child care is expected to accelerate in the house 
beginning next week and republicans made clear they wanted to 
revise the senate measure substantially 
im going to encourage the administration not to view what 
happened in the senate as final senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas said just before the final vote theres a long way to 
go 
but democrats characterized the legislation as historic and a 
longoverdue effort to support lowincome parents who want or need 
to work but cannot find or afford child care 
the real winners the children are closer to a safer more 
effective and affordable childcare program said sen edward m 
kennedy dmass 
this is a monumental achievement said republican sen orrin 
hatch of utah who crossed party lines to cosponsor the plan with 
sen christopher dodd dconn 
still dole said changes would be needed to win bushs support 
theres nothing in this bill for the president of the united 
states dole said he supports child care he wants a bill he 
can sign but to get one youve got to give him something that he 
wants 
exasperated democrats said they had done just that 
an amendment by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas added to the 
democrats bill a tax credit the white house had sought bentsen 
copied it from an alternative republican childcare package defeated 
tuesday 
another bushsupported provision already was included in the 
democratic package as well as a third credit to help pay for 
childrens health insurance which bush opposes 
the president also opposes the centerpiece of the democratic 
bill a 175 billion authorization for direct subsidies to help 
parents pay for child care and to help states improve the 
availability and affordability of services 
i offer this amendment in the spirit of compromise bentsen 
said the president of the united states cant have it all 
but as the senate voted 5445 along partisan lines in favor of 
bentsens proposal the white house served notice that adding 
provisions bush supports would not sway his opposition to the 
legislation the act for better child care 
the abc bill in any combination is a candidate for a veto 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
after failing to defeat bentsens proposal republicans offered 
another amendment that would heave essentially repealed it 
signaling an escalated political fight with more than a dozen 
amendments to come 
but when democrats again beat back the gop effort 5344 the 
confrontational mood gave way to businesslike though partisan 
consideration of the remaining amendments 
senate majority leader george mitchell had promised to an unusual 
saturday session to finish the bill but that proved unnecessary 
the new twist in bentsens amendment was an expansion of the 
earned income tax credit to provide up to 750 a year in new tax 
relief to lowincome parents with children under 5 
the proposal mirrored the central element of the defeated gop 
alternative which had white house support 
already in the democratic bill was a provision allowing 
lowincome parents to take advantage of the existing dependent care 
tax credit up front by making it refundable paying cash to 
families who are eligible for the credit but cannot take advantage 
of it because they dont make enough to owe any federal taxes 
both bushs and the democrats original proposal would have made 
the dependent care credit 100 percent refundable bentsens 
amendment made it 90 percent refundable a change he made to pay for 
the expanded earned income credit without adding to the estimated 3 
billion annual cost of the taxrelief portion of the bill 
republicans argued that the credit should remain 100 percent 
refundable they called for the elimination of the third part of the 
bentsen package a credit of up to 500 a year to help pay for
