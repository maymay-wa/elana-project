the navy has concluded the explosion aboard the 
uss iowa that killed 47 sailors last april was probably caused 
by a detonator put between gun powder bags by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig who died in the blast pentagon sources said 
wednesday 
the sources who were briefed by navy officers and who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the navy investigation into the april 
19 explosion in the battleships no 2 gun turret found foreign 
material in the gun barrel after the explosion 
this material led investigators to believe that hartwig who 
oversaw the loading of the illfated gun was in the best position 
to have sabotaged the powder bags with the detonator 
congressional sources said the navys report which was to be 
released thursday said that an unlawful and illegal act by 
hartwig is pinpointed as the probable cause of the blast 
the navy was hampered in its fourmonth inquiry by the absence of 
any seamen who had survived the explosion at close quarters but 
navy sources had said in may that investigators were looking into 
the possibility of homicide or suicide resulting from a falling out 
between hartwig and another sailor 
members of congress received details on the navy investigation 
the day before the scheduled public release of the 1100page 
report navy cmdr mark baker declined to comment wednesday night on 
the reports from congressional sources 
pentagon sources have said previously that the report cites a 
probability that human action calculated or otherwise could have 
caused the explosion the officials have also said they ruled out 
any specific mechanical cause for the blast 
the explosion occurred as the no 2 gun the middle gun of three 
in the second turret was being loaded for firing practice while the 
battleship was near puerto rico 
the guns and turret were designed in the late 1930s and use 
powder and shells manufactured more than 40 years ago in word war 
ii there had been early speculation that the powder could have 
become unstable but the pentagon later discounted that theory 
gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt one of 11 sailors in the 
base of the sevendeck turret who survived but did not witness the 
blast has criticized the navy for leaking reports that the service 
was investigating his relationship with hartwig 
truitt has said investigators tried to suggest hed had a sexual 
relationship with hartwig or that hartwig had committed suicide 
after the two had a fallingout 
ellis rubin the miami lawyer representing truitt said wednesday 
night this is an underhanded attempt by the navy to explain its 
negligence in training the crew and forcing 50yearold technology 
onto the american public in order to preserve the battleship as a 
weapon of war the navy knows the cause of the tragedy and is 
not going to reveal it its all part of a coverup and whitewash to 
save the battleship 
earlier this week seaman david smith said navy investigators 
browbeat him into an admission that hartwig had made a sexual 
advance to him and had talked about how to set off an explosion with 
a cheap timing device smith told abc radio he had received no such 
proposition and had heard of no such timer 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina said smiths statements added a 
strong boost to her campaign to clear her brothers name 
she said wednesday night this is nothing i didnt expect 
none of the guys on the iowa believe my brother blew up the 
turret she said family attorneys would outline their theory of 
the explosion after a navy briefing on thursday 
pentagon sources had said previously that the report also would 
outline numerous training and maintenance lapses on the ship but 
that none of those was identified as a cause of the explosion 
the navy plans to release its report thursday morning with three 
admirals including the no 2 officer of the service briefing 
reporters 
vice chief of naval operations adm leon edney the investigating 
officer rear adm richard milligan and the head of the naval 
investigative service rear adm william schachte will present the 
longawaited study at the pentagon 
the iowa meanwhile is in gaeta italy as part of a tour of the 
mediterranean

an explosion at a shell oil refinery 
touched off a huge fire tuesday night that injured at least two 
people and sent a plume of smoke thousands of feet into the air 
authorities said 
it rattled all the windows in my home said robert langston 
a benicia resident who lives seven miles from the plant 
jane tocher an engineering assistant at shell said the plant 
was shut down following the explosion about 635 pm but the fire 
continued to burn out of control two hours later ambulances were 
standing by at the refinerys main gate 
two contract employees for shell were injured and taken to 
brookside hospital in san pablo one man had seconddegree burns on 
25 percent of his body mainly on his back and arms said hospital 
spokeswoman cynthia crawford he was reported in good condition in 
the hospitals burn unit 
the other worker also was in good condition with seconddegree 
burns 
the flames in the lightoil processing unit came from bleedoff 
valves in pipes designed to burn off excess fuel during an 
accident said shell spokesman bill sharkey the unit which 
occupies about 15 acres of the 800acre facility is entirely 
constructed of metal 
the cause of the explosion and fire were unknown he said 
neighborhoods were not being evacuated but the sky over martinez 
was thick with black smoke that billowed several thousand feet into 
the sky over the plant 
the smoke gradually was being blown northeastward toward the 
sacramentosan joaquin delta which is sparsely populated it 
stretched for more than 15 miles by early evening 
residents throughout the region said they heard a big blast 
followed by a loud rushing sound which one san francisco radio 
caller described as like three jet engines starting up 
langston said the roaring sound lasted five minutes 
the big explosion was followed by more than a dozen smaller ones 
some of which could be felt as far away as the original blast and 
several releasing large balls of fire over the proceccing unit 
shell firefighters were handling the blaze martinez city 
firefighters were at the plants gate but had not been asked to 
help a county fire truck was loaned to shell 
the refinery is 40 miles northeast of san francisco on the 
carquinez strait a 10 mile stretch of water that run from the san 
francisco bay to the delta

here is the text of president bushs speech in 
which he announced a 79 billion war on drugs 
this is the first time since taking the oath of office that i 
felt an issue was so important so threatening that it warranted 
talking directly with you the american people all of us agree that 
the gravest domestic threat facing our nation today is drugs 
drugs have strained our faith in our system of justice our 
courts our prisons our legal system are stretched to the breaking 
point the social costs of drugs are mounting in short drugs are 
sapping our strength as a nation 
turn on the evening news or pick up the morning paper and youll 
see what some americans know just by stepping out their front door 
our most serious problem today is cocaine and in particular crack 
whos responsible let me tell you straight out 
everyone who uses drugs 
everyone who sells drugs 
and everyone who looks the other way 
tonight i will tell you how many americans are using illegal 
drugs i will present to you our national strategy to deal with 
every aspect of this threat and i will ask you to get involved in 
what promises to be a very difficult fight 
this is crack cocaine seized a few days ago by drug enforcement 
administration agents in a park just across the street from the 
white house it could easily have been heroin or pcp its as 
innocent looking as candy but it is turning our cities into battle 
zones and it is murdering our children 
let there be no mistake this stuff is poison some used to call 
drugs harmless recreation theyre not drugs are a real and 
terribly dangerous threat to our neighborhoods our friends and our 
families 
no one among us is out of harms way when 4yearolds play in 
playgrounds strewn with discarded hypodermic needles and crack vials 
it breaks my heart when cocaine one of the most deadly and 
addictive illegal drugs is available to school kids school kids 
its an outrage and when hundreds of thousands of babies are born 
each year to mothers who use drugs premature babies born 
desperately sick then even the most defenseless among us are at 
risk 
these are the tragedies behind the statistics but the numbers 
also have quite a story to tell let me share with you the results 
of the recently completed household survey of the national institute 
on drug abuse it compares recent drug use to three years ago it 
tells us some good news and some very bad news first the good

as you can see in the chart in 1985 the government estimated 
that 23 million americans were using drugs on a current basis 
that is at least once in the preceding month 
last year that number fell by more than a third that means 
almost 9 million fewer americans are casual drug users good news 
because we changed our national attitude toward drugs casual 
drug use has declined we have many to thank our brave 
lawenforcement officers religious leaders teachers community 
activists and leaders of business and labor 
we should also thank the media for their exhaustive news and 
editorial coverage and for the air time and space for antidrug 
messages 
finally i want to thank president and mrs reagan for their 
leadership all of these good people told the truth that drug use 
is wrong and dangerous 
but as much comfort as we can draw from these dramatic 
reductions there is also bad news very bad news 
roughly 8 million people have used cocaine in the past year 
almost 1 million of them used it frequently once a week or more 
what this means is that in spite of the fact that overall 
cocaine use is down frequent use has almost doubled in the last few 
years and thats why habitual cocaine users especially crack 
users are the most pressing immediate drug problem 
what then is our plan 
to begin with i trust the lesson of experience no single policy 
will cut it no matter how glamorous or magical it may sound to win 
that war against addictive drugs like crack will take more than just 
a federal strategy it will take a national strategy one that 
reaches into every school every workplace involving every family 
earlier today i sent this document our first such national 
strategy to the congress it was developed with the hard work of our 
nations first drug policy director bill bennett 
in preparing this plan we talked with state local and community 
leaders law enforcement officials and experts in education drug 
prevention and rehabilitation we talked with parents and kids we 
took a long hard look at all that the federal government has done 
about drugs in the past whats worked and lets be honest what 
hasnt 
too often people in government acted as if their part of the 
problem whether fighting drug production or drug smuggling or 
drug demand was the only problem but turf battles wont win this 
war teamwork will 
tonight im announcing a strategy that reflects the coordinated 
cooperative commitment of all federal agencies in short this plan 
is as comprehensive as the problme with this strategy we now 
finally have a plan that coordinates our resources our programs and 
the people who run them 
our weapons in this strategy are the law and criminal justice 
system our foreign policy our treatment systems and our schools 
and drug prevention programs 
so the basic weapons we need are the ones we already have what 
has been lacking is a strategy to effectively use them 
let me address four of the major elements of our strategy 
first we are determined to enforce the law to make our streets 
and neighborhoods safe so to start im proposing that we more than 
double federal assistance to state and local law enforcement 
americans have a right to safety in and around their homes 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP890906-0005 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
and we wont have safe neighborhoods unless we are tough on drug 
criminals much tougher then we are now 
sometimes that means tougher penalties but more often it just 
means punishment that is swift and certain 
weve all heard stories about drug dealers who are caught and 
arrested again and again but never punished well here the 
rules have changed if you sell drugs you will be caught and when 
you are caught you will be prosecuted and once youre convicted 
you will do time 
caught prosecuted punished 
i am also proposing that we enlarge out criminal justice system 
across the board at the local state and federal levels alike we 
need more prisons more jails more courts more prosecutors so 
tonight im requesting altogether an almost billionandahalf 
dollar increase in drugrelated federal spending on law enforcement 
and while illegal drug use is found in every community nowhere 
is it worse than in our public housing projects 
you know the poor have never had it easy in this world but in 
the past they werent mugged on the way home from work by crack 
gangs and their children didnt have to dodge bullets on the way to 
school that is why im targeting 50 million to fight crime in 
public housing projects to help restore order and to kick out the 
dealers for good 
the second element of our strategy looks beyond our borders 
where the cocaine and crack bought on americas streets is grown and 
processed 
in colombia alone cocaine killers have gunned down a leading 
statesman murdered almost 200 judges and seven members of their 
supreme court the besieged governments of the drugproducing 
countries are fighting back fighting to break the international 
drug rings 
but you and i agree with the courageous president of colombia 
virgilio barco who said that if americans use cocaine then 
americans are paying for murder american cocaine users have to 
understand that out nation has zero tolerance for casual drug use 
we have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in colombia 
to fight alone 
the 65 million emergency assistance announced two weeks ago was 
just our first step in assistance the andean nations in their fight 
against the cocaine cartels colombia has already arrested 
suppliers seized tons of cocaine and confiscated palatial homes of 
drug lords 
but colombia faces a long uphill battle so we must be ready to 
do more 
our strategy allocates more than a quarter of a billion dollars 
for next year in military and law enforcement assistance for the 
three andean nations of colombia bolivia and peru this will be the 
first part of a fiveyear 2 billion program to counter the 
producers the traffickers and the smugglers 
i spoke with president barco last week and we hope to meet with 
the leaders of affected countries in an unprecedented drug summit 
all to coordinate an interamerican strategy against the cartels we 
will work with our allies and friends especially our economic 
summit partners to do more in the fight against drugs 
im also asking the senate to ratify the un antidrug 
convention concluded last december 
to stop these drugs on the way to america i propose that we 
spend more than an billionandahalf dollars on interdiction 
greater interagency cooperation combined with sophisticated 
intelligencegathering and defense department technology can help 
stop drugs at our borders 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP890906-0006 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
our message to the drug cartels is this the rules have changed 
we will help any government that wants our help when requested we 
will for the first time make available the appropriate resources of 
americas armed forces we will intensify our efforts against drug 
smugglers on the high seas in international airspace and at our 
borders 
we will stop the flow of chemicals from the united states used to 
process drugs we will pursue and enforce international agreements 
to track drug money to the front men and financiers 
and then we will handcuff these money launderers and jail them 
just like any street dealers and for drug kingpins the death 
penalty 
the third part of our strategy concerns drug treatment experts 
believe that there are 2 million american drug users who may be able 
to get off drugs with proper treatment but right now only 40 
percent of them are actually getting help this is simply not good 
enough 
many people who need treatment wont seek it on their own and 
some who do seek it are put on a waiting list most programs were 
set up to deal with heroin addicts but today the major problem is 
cocaine users its time we expand our treatment systems and do a 
better job of providing services to those who need them 
so tonight im proposing an increase of 321 million in federal 
spending on drug treatment 
with this strategy we will do more we will work with the 
states we will encourage employers to establish employee assistance 
programs to cope with drug use and because addiction is such a 
cruel inheritance we will intensify our search for ways to help 
expectant mothers who use drugs 
fourth we must stop illegal drug use before it starts 
unfortunately it begins early for many kids before their teens 
but it doesnt start the way you think from a dealer or an addict 
hanging around a school playground more often our kids first get 
their drugs free from friends or even from older brothers or 
sisters peer pressure spreads drug use peer pressure can help stop 
it 
i am proposing a quarterofabilliondollar increase in federal 
funds for school and community prevention programs that help young 
people and adults reject enticements to try drugs and im proposing 
something else every school college and university and every 
workplace must adopt tough but fair policies about drug use by 
students and employees those that will not adopt such policies will 
not get federal funds period 
the private sector also has a role to play i spoke with a 
businessman named jim burke who said he was haunted by the thought 
a nightmare really that somewhere in america at any given 
moment there is a teenage girl who should be in school instead of 
giving birth to a child addicted to cocaine 
so jim did something he led an antidrug partnership financed 
by private funds to work with advertisers and media firms their 
partnership is now determined to work with our strategy by 
generating educational messages worth a million dollars a day 
every day for the next three years a billion dollars worth of 
advertising all to promote the antidrug message

<TEXT>
as president one of my first missions is to keep the national 
focus on our offensive against drugs so next week i will take the 
antidrug message to the classrooms of america in a special 
television address one that i hope will reach every school every 
young american 
but drug education doesnt belong in class or on tv it must 
begin at home and in the neighborhood parents and families must set 
the first example of a drugfree life and when families are broken 
caring friends and neighbors must step in 
these are the most important elements in our strategy to fight 
drugs they are all designed to reinforce one another to mesh into 
a powerful whole to mount an aggressive attack on the problem from 
every angle this is the first time in the history of our country 
that we truly have a comprehensive strategy 
as you can tell such an approach will not come cheaply last 
february i asked for a 700 million increase in the drug budget for 
the coming year over the past six months of careful study we have 
found an immediate need for another billionandahalf dollars with 
this added 22 billion our 1990 drug budget totals almost 8 
billion the largest increase in history 
we need this program fully implemented right away the next 
fiscal year begins just 26 days from now so tonight im asking the 
congress which has helped us formulate this strategy to help us 
move it forward immediately 
we can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or 
adding to the budget deficit we have submitted our plan to congress 
that shows just how to fund it within the limits of our bipartisan 
budget agreement 
i know some will still say that we are not spending enough money 
but those who judge our strategy only by its price tag simply dont 
understand the problem lets face it weve all seen in the past 
that money alone wont solve our toughest problems 
to be strong and efficient our strategy needs these funds but 
there is no match for a united america a determined america an 
angry america our outrage against drugs unites us brings us 
together behind this one plan of action an assault on every front 
this is the toughest domestic challenge weve faced in decades 
and it is a challenge we must face not as democrats or 
republicans liberals or conservatives but as americans the key 
is a coordinated united effort we have responded faithfully to the 
request of the congress to produce our nations first national drug 
strategy 
ill be looking to the democratic majority and our republicans in 
congress for leadership and bipartisan support and our citizens 
deserve cooperation not competition a national effort not a 
partisan bidding war 
to start congress needs not only to act on this national drug 
strategy but also to act on our crime package announced last may a 
package to toughen sentences to beef up law enforcement and build 
new prison space for 24000 inmates 
you and i both know the federal government cant do it alone the 
states need to match tougher federal laws with tougher laws of their 
own stiffer bail probation parole and sentencing 
and we need your help if people you know are users help them 
get off drugs if you are a parent talk to your children about 
drugs tonight

call your local drug prevention program be a big brother or 
sister to a child in need pitch in with your local neighborhood 
watch program whether you give your time or talent everyone counts 
every employer who bans drugs from the workplace 
every school thats tough on drug use 
every neighborhood in which drugs are not welcome 
and most important every one of you who refuses to look the 
other way every one of you counts 
of course victory will take hard work and time but together we 
will win too many young lives are at stake 
not long ago i read a newspaper story about a little boy named 
dooney who until recently lived in a crack house in a suburb of 
washington dc in dooneys neighborhood children dont flinch at 
the sound of gunfire and when they play they pretend to sell to 
each other small white rocks they call crack 
life at home was so cruel that dooney begged his teachers to let 
him sleep on the floor at school and when asked about his future 
6yearold dooney answers i dont want to sell drugs but i will 
probably have to 
well dooney does not have to sell drugs no child in america 
should have to live like this together as a people we can save 
these kids we have already transformed a national attitude of 
tolerance into one of condemnation but the war on drugs will be 
hardwon neighborhood by neighborhood block by block child by 
child 
if we fight this war as a divided nation then the war is lost 
but if we face this evil as a nation united this will be nothing 
but a handful of useless chemicals 
victory victory over drugs is our cause a just cause and with 
your help we are going to win

rajiv gandhi the prime minister flew to 
southern india and became rajiv gandhi the candidate hopscotching 
by helicopter across friendly and hostile political turf as part of 
his upcoming reelection bid 
with forceful voice and blistering rhetoric at odds with his 
congenial pinkcheeked appearance candidate gandhi denounced those 
who oppose him as relics of a feudal past consorters with traitors 
and assassins potential instigators of religious wars 
under indian law he must call elections no later than jan 4 
in less than five years gandhi has grown from political novice 
to confident campaigner as he seeks to perpetuate the dynasty that 
began in 1947 when his grandfather jawaharlal nehru became indias 
first prime minister as the vast asian subcontinent was freed from 
british colonial rule 
the nehrugandhi familys domination of the prime ministership 
has been interrupted only twice for a total of three years it was 
personified and perpetuated by nehrus daughter the ironwilled 
indira gandhi whose assassination in 1984 propelled rajiv gandhi an 
exairline pilot into the leadership of the worlds largest albeit 
flawed and unruly democracy 
the young man who rode to victory on a wave of sympathy for his 
mothers slaying is now at the age of 45 being put to the test of 
harsher political realities 
at last count the elections commission was considering 
applications of 216 parties or wouldbe parties for places on the 
ballot for the elections the problem for the opposition and the 
advantage for gandhi is that the closest thing to a wellorganized 
national political party in india is the congress party he inherited 
from his grandfather and mother 
the next best at the moment is the janata dal or national front 
an evershifting alliance of about half a dozen parties or movements 
constantly at war within itself 
it was the janata dal that gandhi assailed in 13 speeches during 
a 31hour swing in august across the southern states of karnataka 
and andhra pradesh 
to be sure gandhi has been trading barbs with janata dals 
president viswanath pratap singh his former defense and finance 
minister for about three years 
but he has now launched a frontal attack on nt rama rao janata 
dals chairman 
rama rao the chief minister or top elected official of andhra 
pradesh is highly popular across india as a movie star who has 
portrayed just about every major deity in the hindu pantheon he is 
timing the release of his next film for the election campaign 
rama rao who routinely dresses in facial paint and bright orange 
robes invocatory of the gods he portrays is also the leader of 
telegu desam a political party operating only in andhra pradesh 
nevertheless it won the second highest bloc of national parliament 
seats in the 1984 election 30 to the gandhi partys 415 in the 
544seat chamber 
in speeches to congress party rallies officially scheduled as 
public meetings in four economically depressed andhra pradesh 
towns gandhi accused rama raos state government of corruption 
exploitation of the poor and failure to provide protection from a 
murky maoist band known as naxalites 
by the time he got to hyderabad andhra pradeshs state capital 
candidate gandhi had nominally reverted to prime minister gandhi 
seated beside rama rao at a news conference gandhi repeated some of 
the same charges when a reporter tried to ask rama rao a question 
the head of the prime ministers information office gopalaswami 
parthasarathy stepped forward to say this is not a joint press 
conference 
the next day according to the antigandhi national newspaper 
indian express the 70ish movie star sniped at the prime minister as 
an inexperienced young brat 
still a national opinion poll conducted for the news magazine 
india today in august projected gandhis congress party would win 
315 or 58 percent of the seats in the election 
even if the opposition parties as a whole captured a majority 58 
percent of the 10399 registered voters surveyed in the poll said 
they doubted the opposition would be able to form a government and 
if they did 69 percent thought any such government would fall apart 
before its fiveyear term was up

police commanders and army generals who 
fight them often say colombias billionaire cocaine barons have the 
best weapons and politicians money can buy 
colombias conscript soldiers are no match for the wellpaid 
private armies of drug lords they are poorly trained equipped and 
paid typically earning only 2 a month and most are teenage farm 
boys who just want to get home alive 
the countrys police generally earn 110 a month 10 above the 
minimum wage 
narcotics traffickers with vast bankrolls have a total army of 
4000 men who are paid as much as 2000 a month each they have 
their own intelligence units and sophisticated global communications 
drug lords have plenty of the latest small weapons and even 
airplanes and helicopters armed with machine guns a source with 
antinarcotics police has said they are known to have 
shoulderfired light antitank weapons and rifle grenades 
police sources say gonzalo rodriguez gacha one of the major 
suspects has a twinengine cessna airplane armed with 
electronically fired m60 machine guns and four helicopters each 
armed with two m60 machine guns 
colombia has an army of 200000 men and a national police force 
of 80000 both under the defense ministry a colonel at the defense 
ministry said privately only about 20000 of the total were involved 
in daytoday operations against drug traffickers and leftist 
guerrillas 
a us narcotics officer in bogota told the associated press 
infiltration of the security forces was a serious problem he said 
an army colonel could earn up to 15000 a month by tipping off 
traffickers about raids and providing other information 
a former colombian army intelligence officer said one raid on a 
drug traffickers hideout turned up records showing he paid 100000 
a month for information 
drug cartels also are believed to exercise heavy influence on 
colombias lawmakers and judges 
the richest of colombias suspected drug traffickers pablo 
escobar was a member of congress while he was amassing his 
cocainesmuggling fortune 
everyone knew it and no one seemed to care until it became a 
major embarrassment to the congress 
few cases actually come to light because proof is difficult to 
find but colombians generally agree that many of their congressmen 
are on the take from drug traffickers 
no president or cabinet minister has ever been proven to be 
linked to drug traffickers 
however colombias political parties and the congress have 
refused to adopt legislation that would make life very difficult for 
drug traffickers 
for instance they have failed to move rapidly to revamp 
colombias antiquated courts and laws that make it easy for arrested 
drug traffickers to slip through loopholes 
they also have sent hamstrung security forces to fight the drug 
traffickers 
there are some small elite units with uptodate training and 
equipment such as a 2000member antinarcotics unit attached to 
the national police 
however the majority of the army and police labor away without 
the resources to make a real dent in the drug smuggling that 
provides most of the cocaine for us markets 
while soldiers in big cities generally look neat troops in 
remote areas often wear old illfitting boots and carry rucksacks 
that appear as if they are about to fall apart 
it is common to find 30yearold communications equipment that no 
longer works 
army patrols have been seen flagging down rural buses for 
transportation in the vast plains and jungle regions of southern 
colombia they have sallied forth into antidrug battles in the 
north in bananahauling trucks 
an agent of the us drug enforcement administration in colombia 
once said colombian antinarcotics police had to beg gasoline from 
the dea before mounting a raid 
colombia normally gets 10 million a year in equipment and 
training from the united states for fighting drug trafficking 
another 55 million goes mostly for spare parts 
in addition president bush has sent 65 million in equipment 
from an emergency fund 
last week a us narcotics officer at the embassy told reporters 
that colombia could use 200 million a year in foreign aid for 
fighting drug smugglers 
it remains to be seen how much the us equipment will help 
two c130 cargo planes that were turned over to the colombians on 
sunday for example are each 30 years old according to a us 
diplomatic source 
the drug traffickers can often afford the best equipment and most 
daring fighters 
bogota newspapers have said traffickers offered 500000 for a 
single killing the assassination last month of leading presidential 
candidate sen luis carlos galan 
informants have told narcotics police that members of drug cartel

getting tough with deadly drug gangs may 
be a macho job in a macho land but the man whos doing it is 69 
with white hair and an unsteady voice and has been depicted in 
colombian newspapers as a weak leader 
virgilio barco elected to a fouryear term in 1986 looks more 
like a university professor than the president of a violent nation 
polls have shown as many as 70 percent of colombians disapprove 
of his performance but the number of serious problems he faces 
simultaneously may be unprecedented for a president of this troubled 
south american country 
in addition to murderous drug traffickers barco has to deal with 
an estimated 10000 leftist guerrillas a foreign debt of 15 
billion and declining prices for colombias gold oil and coal 
he is a quiet man who thinks reads and studies history he does 
not smoke and drinks only an occasional glass of white wine at 
official receptions 
his only sport is golf which he is not able to play often and 
his handicap is a state secret 
aides say the president rises at 5 am and begins his day with a 
briefing on what happened during the five or six hours he slept 
barco graduated from the massachussetts institute of technology 
is married to carolina isackson of york pa and served as 
ambassador to washington he became so americanized and made so many 
errors in spanish grammar during his presidential campaign that the 
cocktail circuit made him the butt of jokes 
on aug 18 assassins hired by cocaine barons killed sen luis 
carlos galan at a rally galan was the leading presidential 
candidate and an outspoken foe of the narcotics trade 
if the drug lords had expected barco to knuckle under they were 
wrong in the toughest presidential speech colombias 30 million 
people had heard in many years he said the nation might face the 
most bloodshed since a civil war four decades ago took 250000 lives 
he said he was sending police and soldiers to raid and confiscate 
hundreds of luxurious villas ranches and other property of drug 
traffickers his delivery may not have been forceful but his 
message is shaking the country from the high andes to its vast 
plains 
in the most surprising announcement of all barco said he was 
using emergency powers to extradite colombians so those wanted on 
drug charges in the united states could be tried there 
the traffickers who have said often they preferred tombs in 
colombia to jail cells in the united states retaliated with a 
rampage of terror bombings and arson 
what the outcome will be is not clear barcos term as president 
has 11 months to run

for the first time in more than a decade back to 
school should mean back to the same school for most children under a 
revamped relaxed desegregation plan officials say 
three years in the making controlled choice replaces a 
system blamed for the loss of hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
middleclass students to private parochial and suburban schools 
anybody can pick at the edges of this plan said mayor 
charles royer i think the school administration has done a good 
job 
under one key feature virtually all the systems 43000 students 
have been told they can remain at the same school from year to year 
until they advance to the next level from grade school to middle 
school for example 
since 1978 when the city became the largest in the nation to 
adopt a mandatory desegregation plan without a court order students 
have been switched from one school to another an average of three 
times in grade school and once each in middle and high schools to 
maintain racial balance 
white students comprise 466 percent of seattles public school 
system with nonwhites predominately blacks asians and hispanics 
at 534 percent said pat patterson a spokeswoman for the school 
system however the desegregation plan concerns only balance 
between blacks and nonblacks and ms patterson did not know the 
breakdown of the student population in those terms 
superintendent william kendrick convened an advisory panel to 
begin work on the new plan shortly after he was hired in 1986 he 
said it should cut reliance on mandatory busing in half this year 
and could end busing entirely in as little as three years although 
he is making no predictions at this point 
were into a transitional period kendrick said my goal is 
a totally voluntary program 
the plan covers the entire city including some predominately 
white north end neighborhoods that had previously been exempt it 
also include kindergartners for the first time 
under the new policy parents can choose any grade school from a 
cluster of at least a halfdozen that includes one in their 
neighborhood exceptions are allowed for 4th 5th 7th and 
8thgraders to remain in their current schools and in some cases 
for students to attend the same schools as brothers and sisters 
despite a rocky start with assignments delayed by computer 
problems and uncounted parents registering children in public and 
private schools the plan shows signs of success kendrick said 
of the 43293 children registered by monday 90 percent got their 
first choice of schools ms patterson said tuesday classes start 
wednesday 
but parents who didnt get their first choices for their children 
voiced their displeasure 
its been a horrible two weeks all weve asked is for them to 
be assigned together said mary potts whose firstgrade sons 
school assignment is an hours bus ride from the school her 
thirdgrade daughter will attend 
for others like rochelle mastin the outcome was better i 
cant believe it said mastin who moved to seattle a year ago and 
feared her 7yearold daughters request would not be granted 
weve got a number of parents now who are coming in and saying 
theyre coming back from the private schools kendrick said he 
said he had no precise number but that 300 parents had expressed 
that sentiment recently at one of three special parent information 
centers 
only after fall enrollment figures are tallied next month will 
there be any solid indication of how many students the public school 
system regained he said 
kendrick said half of the 21000 students who relied on buses 
last year would have done so regardless of desegregation 30 percent 
were taking advantage of optional and special programs and 20 
percent were transported solely to achieve racial balance 
mandatory busing should be cut to 10 percent this year and still 
lower after two years the end of the grandfathering period for 
school assignments he said 
despite improvements in the desegregation program opponents of 
mandatory busing in any form are pushing initiative 34 dubbed sos 
for save our schools 
it would reserve 6 percent of the citys sales tax revenue 
about 4 million a year for magnet programs in schools with 
less than 33 percent white enrollment but only if forced busing 
were discontinued the city now provides no money for operation of 
the schools 
the city council and school board have sought court action to 
keep the latest measure off the nov 7 general election ballot a 
ruling is expected in about a week 
my concern is that in all this furor over the initiative that 
people give this new plan a chance royer said i think the 
school administration has done a good job

a trans world airlines jet with 151 people 
aboard had to dive suddenly tuesday to avoid another plane directly 
in its path at 37000 feet and five passengers were injured an 
airline spokesman said 
air traffic controllers in chicago apparently steered the plane 
onto the collision course said twa spokesman don morrison but a 
federal aviation administration spokesman in chicago disputed 
morrisons statement 
we have no knowledge of air traffic controllers being 
involved faa spokesman mort edlestein told the associated press 
morrison said twa flight 818 was approaching detroit about 45 
minutes after it took off from st louis lambert international 
airport at 421 pm cdt nonstop for paris when contact was made 
with chicago air traffic controllers 
the pilot was given a vector change a direction change by the 
air traffic control system morrison said he made that change 
until situated at 37000 feet which was his assigned altitude 
as he made the turn he noted immediately in front of him an 
airplane a foreign aircraft he immediately dropped altitude to 
avoid the aircraft he avoided the aircraft went underneath it 
morrison said 
edlestein said the incident involved the twa jetliner and a 
military aircraft but said it was not being classified immediately 
as a near collision 
the last we knew the planes were eight miles apart said 
edlestein why he took evasive action we wont know until we talk 
to the twa pilot 
edelstein said the faa and the national transportation safety 
board would investigate 
morrison said the twa pilot returned to st louis because the 
airlines main maintenance facility is located at lambert flight 
818s passengers were reboarded on other flights to paris he said 
the plane returned to st louis about 6 pm cdt 
morrison said the five injured people one a flight attendant 
were taken to hospitals for treatment none was believed to be 
seriously hurt

academics and cultural groups worldwide are 
tentatively reaching out again to china but the june crackdown the 
prodemocracy movement and its aftermath have left both sides wary 
of each other 
chinese officials say they want exchanges but accuse western 
countries of seeking to subvert chinas socialist system by sowing 
ideas about democracy and capitalism 
windows cannot be opened without a screen to keep flies and 
bacteria from coming in freely vice education minister he 
dongchang said in a recent interview 
in an example of the new armslength approach he said china will 
send abroad fewer doctoral students but more shortterm visiting 
scholars who are less likely to fall in love with life abroad 
just 20000 of the 80000 students china has sent abroad in the past 
decade have returned 
on the other side western students and scholars say they want to 
continue work in china but fear it could be interpreted as a sign of 
unconcern or even support for the june 34 army attack on student 
prodemocracy protesters in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were 
killed 
we are hopeful that scholarly exchanges will resume but only 
under conditions with which we can feel comfortable and not 
serve political purposes said michel oksenberg a chinese 
specialist and political science professor at the university of 
michigan 
if anything the events of april through june underscore the 
inadequacies of our understanding of each others societies he 
said 
foreign academics also wonder if it will be possible to share 
ideas as before given the governments new emphasis on stamping out 
the western liberal influences it blames for the spring of student 
protests 
dont talk about politics chinese university officials 
warned several americans who arrived to teach english 
last year we had a debate i was george bush and my roommate 
was michael dukakis the us presidential candidates said one 
american teacher speaking on condition of anonymity we went 
through this whole spiel about how america elects presidents i 
wonder if theyd let us do that this year 
it is not yet clear how the dismissal of liberal culture minister 
wang meng announced by the government monday might affect chinas 
cultural ties with the outside world wang a novelist who survived 
two decades of persecution because of his candid works actively 
supported free expression and artistic exchanges with the outside 
world 
his apparent successor former propaganda department official he 
jingzhi is unlikely to change chinas policy of encouraging 
scientific educational and cultural exchanges but will likely 
require closer monitoring of foreign books plays movies and 
performers for political messages 
before june chinas cultural exchanges with the rest of the 
world were spiraling so rapidly that bob frame of the british 
council which administers government cultural programs said his 
office had a hard time keeping up 
but after the army attack most exchanges with china came to an 
abrupt halt foreign teachers and students were evacuated by their 
governments amid fears of civil war and some countries canceled 
planned visits by chinese performers 
suddenly frame said his office had time to install a new 
computer system 
over the past three months however what many foreign scholars 
referred to as the trauma of june has subsided and the lure of 
china has reasserted itself 
with the new academic year exchanges are tentatively resuming 
programs that bring foreign scholars to china for short periods have 
the highest percentage of returnees 
no figures are available but there seems to be a shortage of 
foreigners to teach english at beijing colleges a job often taken 
by recent american college graduates 
they just begged me to stay an american woman back for her 
second year of english teaching said of her university officials 
other americans said chinese schools are so eager for native 
english speakers that they were hired with the briefest of 
interviews 
yale and stanford two major us universities that send 
graduates each year to teach english will not this fall 
many european and american schools also are not sending chinese 
language students placing them in taiwan or hong kong programs 
instead out of concern for their safety 
but most say the move is temporary and that they would like to 
return to beijing when it lifts martial law now in its fourth month 
the university of south carolina is even thinking of starting up 
a new program to send international business students to china 
china will be a major player in the world economy said the 
universitys jeffrey arpan explaining his visit to beijing to meet 
chinese educators 
western performing groups seem in no hurry to rush back to china 
partly in anger over the crackdown and partly because commercial 
sponsors are reluctant however most foreign tours by chinese 
groups this fall are going forward 
most chinese scheduled to go abroad to teach or study also appear 
to be going although the ford foundation said a few scholars 
canceled us visits because they are being investigated in 
connection with the protests 
political investigations and reeducation also have distracted 
from planning new programs embassy spokesman sheridan bell said 
chinese officials say lets wait until after oct 1 lets wait 
until the new year when the embassy suggests exchange ideas 
oksenberg said putting exchanges on hold makes him nervous it 
reminds him he said of 1949 when the communists took power 
things were postponed and it was thought to be temporary but 
it turned out to be for 20 years he said

for sale 450 units of old military 
housing at westover air force base at 1 for each two three and 
fourfamily unit 
the hitch they must be carted off by dec 15 and rehabilitated 
at an estimated 77000 each 
chicopee officials concede the deal they are offering is no 
bargain 
id be shocked if we got any offers community development 
director thomas haberlin said tuesday they are not worth 
77000 
but before the city can demolish the vacant apartments to develop 
the surplus base property state regulations require it to make 
every effort to sell them he said 
the units are not in very good condition but we thought we 
ought to give it a shot even through it is unlikely that we will 
find someone with a use for them agreed allan w blair president 
of the westover metropolitan development corp 
the corporation is a regional group that has been working for 15 
years to develop the base property declared surplus by the military 
when it scaled back the former strategic air command base 
blair said the 38yearold housing was very modest even in 
its salad days and has been vacant since it was abandoned by the air 
force in 1973 
the units are difficult and costly to move because they were laid 
on concrete slabs with no basements or floor joists to hold them 
together he said 
before they can be lifted you have to run steel rods through 
the walls to hold them together and then you have to set them down 
very precisely because the utilities are run through the walls and 
you have only a 4inch margin of error he said 
after weeks of advertising the development group has gotten 
inquiries about just two units haberlin said so far though no 
deals

nancy reagan who launched an antidrug 
effort during her eight years as first lady said education remains 
the key in fighting drug abuse 
she also told a womens conference tuesday that her just say 
no campaign produced positive results 
they talk about colombia and how terrible it is which it is 
but they dont talk about the fact that at the lower age levels 
there has been progress made she said hours before president bush 
unveiled his 79 billion plan to attack drug abuse 
id like to think that was a little bit due to the work that we 
did 
mrs reagan said education may be the long way around to 
conquer drug abuse but it is necessary 
i think we have to take the customer away from the drug we can 
only do that through education she said 
recently us attention has focused on violence sweeping through 
colombia because of the recent crackdown on cocaine traffickers 
colombias efforts were started after the assassination of a 
presidential candidate opposed to the drug trade 
they have to realize that yes there may be the cartels in 
colombia or wherever and its sometimes easier to talk about that 
than it is about the fellow on the corner who you can arrest or the 
wall street broker whos dealing or using 
yes the cocaine may be foreigngrown but the users are 
homegrown she said 
mrs reagan also talked about her years in the white house during 
the speech to the southern california conference on women 
everything is larger than life the highs are higher by the 
same token the lows are lower she said of life on pennsylvania 
avenue 
after moving from washington back to california i was 
exhausted for a month mrs reagan said

the bush administration in a move to break a 
diplomatic impasse in the middle east is seeking arab and israeli 
support for a proposal by egyptian president hosni mubarak for 
holding palestinian elections us officials say 
among the 10point proposals key elements are provisions for 
voting by palestinian residents of jerusalem and for the temporary 
withdrawal of israeli troops from voting areas throughout the west 
bank and in gaza 
this is a start an official said tuesday its the kind of 
thing we need 
but he and other us officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it was not clear if mubaraks ideas were acceptable 
to israel or to the palestine liberation organization 
a plan pushed by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has the 
administrations endorsement the plo which has the power to block 
its implementation is cool to a key provision temporary selfrule 
but not statehood for the 14 million palestinian arabs who live on 
the west bank and in gaza 
the territories were captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
sixday war and are under israeli control the plo demands a state 
an outcome opposed by both israel and the united states 
shamirs idea is to have elected palestinians negotiate with 
israel a temporary arrangement for selfrule in the territories 
this would be followed by talks on an overall middle east settlement 
involving also jordan and egypt 
among mubaraks suggestions officials said were the temporary 
withdrawal of israeli troops from polling areas and participation in 
the balloting by palestinians who live in east jerusalem 
also leaders of the palestinian insurrection on the west bank 
and in gaza who have been deported would have a role to play by 
conveying their negotiating ideas to palestinian residents 
israel which has vowed never to relinquish control of jerusalem 
its capital is opposed to balloting by palestinians who live in the 
city it is one of the main sticking points in the sofar 
unsuccessful us effort to launch negotiations 
mubaraks idea the official said is to have the palestinians 
vote outside jerusalem and then return to their homes 
the plo meanwhile has denounced the election plan as a ploy to 
ward off establishment of a palestinian state 
in light of these and other differences mubaraks proposal was 
warmly received by the bush administration 
mubaraks approach is a way of getting the election proposal to 
take a few steps forward an official said he has offered 
himself as a mediator to bridge the gap 
another us official also insisting on anonymity said these 
are interesting ideas the egyptians are trying to help the process 
of getting to elections 
the officials said american diplomats had taken up the proposal 
with israel and with arab governments meanwhile no date has been 
set for a resumption of us talks with the plo in tunisia where 
yasser arafats organization has its headquarters

president bush the latest in a long line of 
leaders to declare war against drugs is tackling a 100 
billionayear narcotics industry with a 79 billion program 
already embroiled in political dispute 
bush describes the program he announced in his first nationally 
televised address as a plan that is as comprehensive as the 
problem 
to critics such as rep charles rangel dny chairman of the 
house select committee on narcotics it is a thousand points of 
light with no batteries 
quite frankly said senate judiciary committee chairman 
joseph biden the presidents plan is not tough enough bold 
enough or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand 
quite simply congressional democrats are not willing to let bush 
seize the initiative or claim credit for leading a politically 
popular cause 
after all it was the democraticcontrolled congress that 
overcame opposition from thenpresident reagan and passed 
legislation that required nowpresident bush to develop the overall 
drug strategy he announced tuesday night 
house speaker thomas foley faults bushs plan as too limited but 
also warns that it could increase pressure for a tax increase 
biden for example is already calling for higher taxes on wine 
beer and cigarettes to finance the drug war 
bush however insists that the battle can be waged without 
raising taxes or increasing the deficit he proposed siphoning more 
than 751 million from other areas including juvenile justice 
housing immigration and economic development 
politicians of every stripe recognize that americans are anxious 
for action a gallup poll released at the white house last month 
found that a record 27 percent of adults view drugs as the most 
important problem facing the nation more serious than poverty the 
economy the environment and even fear of war that survey was taken 
even before the declaration of war by drug barons against the 
government of colombia 
despite efforts by every president for decades the drug problem 
in america has swollen to immense proportions with cocaine more 
plentiful purer cheaper and more in demand than ever 
its big business for drug lords in latin america and their us 
lieutenants the us chamber of commerce estimates illegal drug 
sales at 110 billion annually more than double the profits of all 
the fortune 500 companies combined 
there are plenty of willing consumers about 21 million americans 
have tried cocaine 3 million still use it occasionally and 1 
million report being heavy users 
those cocaine users are the chief targets of bushs program 
rather than emphasize efforts to intercept drugs before they reach 
the united states bushs strategy is to go after the casual user 
where this country got off track in the late 60s and 70s was 
believing the only people worthy of attention were the major 
traffickers and kingpins and not the individual users said 
william bennett bushs national drug policy director and the author 
of much of bushs program 
bushs proposal encourages states to adopt harsher fines for

many americans should avoid taxdeferred 
savings plans such as iras because they merely shift income to a 
time when theyll be subject to higher tax rates a private research 
group says 
many middleincome retirees are discovering their marginal tax 
rate is up to four times higher than the rate they paid while 
working the national center for policy analysis a nonprofit 
group based in dallas said in a report released tuesday 
for many people the promise of taxdeferred savings is a cruel 
hoax the study said 
many retirees are worse off because they put their savings in 
iras rather than ordinary savings accounts the study said adding 
that many younger people also would be better off avoiding 
taxdeferred savings programs which include iras and 401ks 
the higher tax rates for the elderly exist because some social 
security benefits now are taxed and some elderly people pay a new 
surtax for medicare coverage against catastrophic illnesses the 
report said 
these two taxes combined can raise the marginal tax rates of 
elderly retirees as much as 37 percentage points said aldona 
robbins a former treasury department economist and a coauthor of 
the study 
for example an elderly widow with 24000 of income from 
interest dividends and a pension in addition to her social security 
benefits faces a 1989 marginal tax rate of 483 percent on income 
from savings the study said without the social security and 
medicare taxes she would be in the 15 percent federal income tax 
bracket 
the value of iras company pensions and other taxdeferred 
savings has been severely eroded for about 60 percent of todays 
workers by the two taxes the group said 
the report warned that the higher tax rates for the elderly 
jeopardize the nations ability to stimulate the personal savings 
needed to fuel investment in the us economy and increase 
productivity 
under the current system about 70 billion per year is 
deposited into taxdeferred savings by younger people not yet aware 
that they are deferring taxes to the time when they will be facing 
the highest marginal tax rates the study said once this fact 
is widely known the effect on saving in the us will be 
devastating 
the study recommended abolishing both the social security and 
medicare taxes or at least changing the tax treatment of retirement 
savings perhaps by allowing people to pay taxes on deposits to 
savings programs at the point when their marginal tax rates are 
lower 
under the 1983 social security revisions half of all social 
security benefits are subject to federal income tax if half the 
benefits plus all nonsocial security income exceed 25000 for an 
individual or 32000 for a couple for these people 50 cents of 
the social security benefit is taxed for each dollar of additional 
income 
the medicare surcharge for the elderly was approved by congress 
last year to help finance coverage of catastrophic illnesses in 
1989 a 15 percent surtax is imposed on federal income tax 
liabilities over 150 affecting about 40 of percent of those 65 and 
older with the surtax rising to 28 percent by 1993 the maximum 
surtax payment is capped at 800 per person in 1989 and rises to 
1050 in 1993

the oil industry will be hardpressed to 
organize a nationwide network of oil spill response teams by the end 
of next summer according to a retired coast guard commander chosen 
to direct the project 
on his first day as president of piro implementation inc john 
d costello said tuesday the industryfinanced group hopes to get 
the response teams fully equipped and ready for possible action 
within one year 
even thats going to press us costello 59 said in a 
telephone interview 
costellos organization is charged with creating a petroleum 
industry response organization a coasttocoast network of spill 
cleanup experts and equipment that can respond quickly to a major 
oil accident anywhere in us waters 
the idea was proposed in june by the major oil companies as the 
industrys main response to the exxon valdez disaster in alaska 
the largest oil spill ever in us waters 
costello who retired from the coast guard as a vice admiral in 
july 1988 said he saw some exciting possibilities for quickly 
improving the industrys capability of cleaning up shorelines hit 
with large oil spills 
but he stressed that it will take longer to develop ways to limit 
the spread of spills as large as the valdez accident in which the 
exxon tanker dumped 11 million gallons of crude into prince william 
sound after ramming a reef 
current technology simply does not exist to contain spills of 
that size he said 
the proposed industry network would include a headquarters in 
washington dc and regional response centers in new york 
norfolk va new orleans long beach calif and seattle 
each center would be staffed around the clock by trained cleanup 
specialists and would be equipped to handle a 30000ton oil spill 
about the same as the valdez spill 
the whole system including piro implementation is being 
financed by the major oil companies the industry said last june in 
announcing plans for the response system that it would spend 250 
million on the project over five years 
costello capped a 36year coast guard career with a fouryear 
stint as pacific commander based in alameda calif from 198488 
he previously was the services representative on the national 
security council at the state department and at the justice 
department 
costello directed coast guard activities during the mass exodus 
of cubans to the united states in 1980 and during his tenure as 
pacific commander he played a role in directing the cleanup of 
several oil spills off the west coast

potato farmers didnt go overboard on plantings 
this year despite the temptation of high market prices and brisk 
consumer demand agriculture department figures show 
last years drought reduced potato output sharply and sent prices 
upward both at the producer and consumer levels 
in the first six months of 1989 according to the government 
index consumer prices of fresh potatoes were up an average of about 
37 percent from the first half of 1988 
prices paid to growers nearly doubled during the same period 
peaking at an average of 947 per 100 pounds compared with 525 a 
year earlier 
total us potato output in 1988 hit severely in many states by 
last years drought dropped to less than 350 million hundredweight 
down 10 percent from 1987 
potato prices in 1989 have been boosted by several factors the 
most important being last years 10 percent crop reduction says 
the departments economic research service this decline tightened 
stocks in the face of relatively strong demand especially for 
processing largely freezing potatoes 
with a shorter crop and rising prices it made sense to expect a 
big rebound in planted acreages this year but there was only a 
slight increase 
the agency report said the lure of expected strong alternative 
crops such as barley sugarbeets and wheat helped hold down 1989 
potato expansion along with the feeling of many that the recent 
boom would be followed by a bust as often happens in the potato 
industry 
other factors cited by usda economists included a 49 percent 
increase in seed potato prices and poor weather in many areas at 
the start of the 1989 growing season prompting some farmers to 
switch to later crops 
seed potatoes rose to an average of 1060 per 100 pounds by 
midapril up 348 from a year earlier assuming an average seeding 
rate of 20 hundredweight per acre that translated into 70 more per 
acre for planting this years crop 
if production this year shows only a modest increase to around 
375 million hundredweight usda analysts say rising processor demand 
and continued export strength virtually ensure that the 198990 
potato market will remain strong 
analysts cite several changes that lend optimism to the us 
potato outlook 
a long decline in fresh potato use has stopped or at least 
slowed down fresh use averaged 47 pounds per person annually from 
1986 to 1988 about the same as in the early 1980s 
contributing factors include promotion campaigns by the potato 
industry and the convenience of microwave ovens 
the domestic use of frozen french fries and other frozen items 
rose to 45 pounds per capita from 36 pounds in 1980 
exports of frozen potatoes particularly french fries rose to 
3091 million pounds of product weight in 1988 from 845 million 
pounds in 1980 
based on shipments through june this years frozen potato 
exports are up 27 percent from last year with french fries 
accounting for 88 percent of the volume

an agriculture department scientist is trying 
to make plant seeds take a nap and then wake up refreshed and ready 
to germinate 
research chemist sharon sowa of the departments agricultural 
research service is seeking ways of preserving seeds from a wide 
variety of plants including wheat passion fruit and guayule a 
natural substitute for rubber 
the sleep technique also could be used to prepare seeds for 
surgery by scientists who want to develop new plant varieties 
that can resist diseases withstand drought or add additional 
nutrients to diets 
in a report by the agency sowa said her goal was to treat 
seeds some day much like doctors treat their patients in surgery 
the same anesthetics such as nitrous oxide laughing gas that are 
used to slow human respiration during surgery also slow the life 
processes inside seeds 
sowa works at the usdas national seed laboratory fort collins 
colo where vast collections of plant species are held in cold 
storage the facility is maintained as insurance against seeds 
becoming extinct and as a resource for plant breeders 
nitrous oxide is what we call a permeable molecule it goes in 
and out of plant cells very easily without causing any damage 
she said exactly how it works to slow respiration in humans and 
seeds is unknown 
sowa said that on tests of snap beans a mixture of 80 percent 
nitrous oxide and air was blown over the seeds slowing cell 
respiration in the beans by 35 percent enough to anesthetize the 
seeds 
half an hour later she revived the seeds by exposing them to 
fresh air sowa said all the seeds eventually woke up and germinated 
normally

dry weather in the west has created problems 
for sheep producers and has raised doubts that the us flock will 
continue growing as it has in recent years according to an 
agriculture department report 
the slaughter of mature sheep has increased dramatically 
particularly in texas and new mexico where it is up 30 percent from 
last year says the report by the departments economic research 
service 
exports of live sheep to mexico which are typically cull 
mature ewes were 190584 head in the first half of this year 
compared with 31766 head a year earlier the report said 
increased slaughter and increased exports of live sheep raise 
questions about the industrys ability to continue the production

the united states after successfully 
persuading the soviet union to lower its emigration barriers is 
trying to deal with the rising tide of jewish emigres 
the backlog of 35000 soviet jews seeking entry to the united 
states poses economic and philosophic problems after encouraging 
moscow to lower barriers to emigration it would be awkward for the 
united states to restrict admission 
a total of 22462 soviet immigrants not all of them jews 
entered the united states in a ninemonth period that ended june 30 
according to the state department 
figures released tuesday night showed a steep increase over a 
fouryear period from 640 in 1985 to 20421 in 1988 
under consideration to deal with the increase a us official 
said tuesday is a sixmonth waiting period for emigres who dont 
have close relatives in the united states 
there also is a proposal to process refugees in moscow phasing 
out the vienna offices through which many of the emigres pass 
processing the emigres in moscow would mean the addition of dozens 
of us workers there to handle paperwork 
but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity stressed 
that no decision had been made although one may be imminent 
we are not prepared to announce any policy decisions at this 
time said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
she estimated that more than 50000 soviets not all of them 
jews would apply to emigrate to the united states this year 
although most soviet jews file applications to go to israel the 
vast majority opt for the united states once they reach vienna 
that distresses the israeli government and many of its supporters 
who see in the soviet jewish population the last large reservoir of 
potential immigrants to help build up the jewish state 
it isnt clear whether closing the vienna office would have the 
effect of increasing the flow to israel once an emigre goes there 
or to any other country it is more difficult to gain admission to 
the united states 
there is no consensus at the state department to close the door 
on anyone the official said disputing a published report that 
soviet jews who dont have close relatives in the united states 
would become ineligible 
however the official said they could be kept on hold for six 
months in the soviet union those who didnt gain entry might apply 
for parole status which requires support from private organizations 
meanwhile justice department spokesman david runkel said the fbi 
had expressed concern that a large influx of soviet emigres could 
increase the likelihood of spying 
although there have been discussions about curbing soviet 
immigration the justice department has not signed off on any 
proposal at this time he said

the navy is unable to cite a specific reason 
for the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard the uss iowa and is 
expected to point only to the probability that human 
intervention could have caused the tragedy defense department 
officials say 
three navy admirals including the services no 2 man are 
slated to release the report thursday 
the study wraps up the investigation into the april 19 explosion 
in the battleships no 2 gun turret which occurred during open 
seas gunnery practice near puerto rico 
defense department officials speaking privately say the report 
is not expected to point to a single cause of the blast 
investigators were hampered by the fact that no eyewitnesses 
survived 
there is no specific cause cited said one official who 
spoke on condition his name not be used its very complicated 
and the report goes into a considerable amount of detail its very 
complex 
another official who also spoke on background said the report 
cites a probability that human action calculated or otherwise 
could have caused the explosion 
when they cant find a mechanical reason in an investigation 
they look to see whether there was a human factor involved the 
second official said 
that official said investigators tried to look at all the 
circumstances that could have led to the explosion but that none 
appears to have been the overriding reason for the disaster 
the naval investigative service launched a criminal investigation 
into the allegations of murder and sabotage but failed to come up 
with any solid conclusions and will instead provide a summary of 
the evidence compiled through interviews statements and other 
research the official said 
the official said the report will show a number of lapses in 
procedures involving maintenance and the certification of sailors 
to operate the ships complex guns 
but such problems were discounted as the primary causes of the 
explosion both officials said 
at his daily briefing pentagon spokesman pete williams said the 
1100page report will be discussed by the vice chief of naval 
operations adm leon edney and the investigating officer rear adm 
richard milligan at a formal pentagon briefing thursday 
it will be a very thorough briefing williams said 
the two admirals will be joined by the head of the nis rear adm 
william schachte 
the longawaited study has been the subject of much speculation 
including numerous television and newspaper reports 
officially the navy has withheld comment on the investigation 
as reports contended investigators were looking into the possibility 
that suicide or murder was involved in the explosion 
gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt one of 11 sailors in the 
base of the sevenstory turret who survived but did not witness the 
blast has charged the navy with leaking reports that it was 
investigating his relationship with gunners mate clayton hartwig 
who died in the explosion 
truitt has said the investigators suggested hed had a sexual 
relationship with hartwig or that hartwig had committed suicide 
after the two had had a fallingout 
truitts lawyer ellis rubin has charged that the report will 
find that there was defective equipment in gun turret no2 as 
well as unqualified personnel manning the guns 
the report will hint at the possibility through circumstantial 
evidence that gunners mate clayton hartwig could have committed 
suicide i trust that the report will clear kendall truitt of any 
prior knowledge or responsibility for the blast whether he was 
accused officially or not rubin said

injury and damage claims are generally lower in 
larger cars and vans an insurance industry study has found 
the highway loss data institute study released tuesday said the 
vehicles with the best results in both injury and damage claims were 
the pontiac safari station wagon the plymouth grand voyager the 
dodge grand caravan the mercury grand marquis station wagon and the 
ford crown victoria station wagon 
vehicles with the worst records had more than double the losses 
of those with the best records with damage results varying more 
than injury results 
cars with the worst claim records in both categories were the 
isuzu imark twodoor ford escort twodoor and exp and three 
mitsubishi models cordia mirage and tredia the institute said 
large domestic cars typically have good results for both injury 
and vehicle damage small cars have poor results for injury and 
damage said brian oneill president of the institute noting 
that european models tend to have low injury results but high damage 
the study measured how likely a particular car model is to be 
involved in an injury accident and how costly damage to the vehicle 
is when compared with the average likelihood of injury or damage for 
all cars on the road 
the results are adjusted for the number of cars of each model on 
the road for possible distortion due to driver age and for 
variations in the deductible amount on insurance policies the 
institute said 
no actual damage or injury claims figures are provided 
oneill said the report covered 1986 1987 and 1988 models but 
provides consumers with a guide to the loss potential of 1989 and 
1990 model cars with no significant design changes because results 
have proved to be consistent from one model year to another 
the institute is a nonprofit public service organization funded 
by the insurance industry and closely associated with the insurance 
institute for highway safety 
the mercedesbenz sdlsel for the second consecutive year had 
the best injury loss record followed by the saab 9000 both cars 
however showed much higher than average collision damage losses 
other cars with the best injury records included the mercedes 
560sl pontiac safari wagon the oldsmobile custom cruiser the 
jaguar xj6 the bmw 500 series the mercedes 260e300de the 
plymouth grand voyager and the dodge grand caravan all had records 
at least 43 percent below the average 
cars with the worst injury records were the hyundai excel 
fourdoor the isuzu imark twodoor the chevrolet sprint twodoor 
the chevrolet spectrum fourdoor and twodoor the ford escort 
twodoor the mitsubishi cordia and mirage the yugo and the hyundai 
excel 
vehicles with the best damage cost averages were the gmc safari 
van and the nearly identical chevrolet astro van the dodge caravan 
and grand caravan and the similar plymouth voyager and grand 
voyager the pontiac safari wagon the mercury grand marquis and the 
chevrolet caprice 
cars with the worst vehicle damage results included the 
volkswagen scirocco the plymouth conquest the porshe 944 coupe 
the bmw 300 series twodoor the mitsubishi cordia the chevrolet 
corvette the toyota supra the nissan 300zx the saab 900 the 
mazda rx7 and mx6 
oneill said the study is based on examination of insurance 
coverage and claim data involving millions of vehicles

in 1885 one major manufacturer was selling cocaine in 15 
different forms including cigarettes cigars inhalants a cordial 
crystals and a solution for injection 
restrictions were imposed in 1914 a substitute offered was 
heroin which only later was found to be addictive

schools colleges and universities stand to 
lose federal aid unless they prove they have tough antidrug use 
policies with stiff penalties for use sale or distribution of 
illicit drugs 
the antidrug strategy unveiled by president bush on tuesday 
night also would pay for altenative schools for youths with drug 
habits and encourage states to declare schools as drugfree zones 
colleges and universities already have conditions for receiving 
federal aid new laws require them to ensure that illegal drugs are 
not being used by employees on the job and to have studentaid 
recipients certify that they do not use drugs 
the new strategy drafted by william bennett director of the 
national drug control policy office would require colleges to 
develop specific punishments for students who use illegal drugs the 
plans will be required as a condition for any federal aid including 
grants and contracts as well as student aid 
this is the primary goal of prevention to see to it that 
americans especially school children never start down a slippery 
slope of drug use that begins with experimentation but can 
culminate in dependency according to the drug strategy document 
for those school children and adults who have already begun to use 
drugs the goal is a rather different one to get them to stop 
elementary and secondary schools would lose federal aid if they 
failed to implement specific punishments for students caught 
possessing using or selling drugs 
american schools have been educating students about drugs for 
more than 20 years statistics show that about 99 percent of high 
schools and 87 percent of elementary schools offer antidrug 
lessons and even some kindergartens offer them 
but the national drug strategy stressed that schoolbased 
prevention programs should be reinforced by tough but fair school 
policies on use possession and distribution of drugs 
voicing his support for bushs clear tough blueprint for a 
drugfree nation education secretary lauro cavazos urged 
educators and parents to resolve to eliminate once and for all 
this threat to american education 
keith geiger new president of the national education 
association agreed that bush laid out a challenge for all of us 
and stressed that were ready to work 
in general the proposal was certainly well intentioned and 
means to do the right thing but is not adequate to meet the 
problem said lou nayman of the american federation of teachers 
it spoke to the goals the kinds of things that need to be 
accomplished but really did not supply any significant resources to 
match the objectives 
bennett singled out the simple and straightforward anne 
arundel county md drug policies that immediately expel any 
student caught selling or distributing drugs when a student is 
caught using or possessing drugs the school notifies the police 
calls his parents and suspends him for one to five days 
the education department has 3545 million budgeted for drug 
prevention programs in the current fiscal year with 83 percent 
going for state and local programs that compares with only 3 
million budgeted for drug education in 1986 
in the next fiscal year the administration is seeking 25 
million more for emergency drug education grants intended for urban 
areas with major drug problems 
the new strategy will encourage states to enact legislation that 
protects schools as drugfree zones about 14 states have failed to 
propose or pass such legislation said the document 
last year new jerseys drugfree school zones resulted in 
arrests of 8800 people statewide 
the plan is for all public and private schools to become 
drugfree zones where dealers and users caught on school grounds 
will face penalties of five years for possession and up to 40 years 
and fines of 40000 for distribution

here are excerpts from the text of president 
bushs speech announcing a 79 billion war on drugs 
 
this is the first time since taking the oath of office that i 
felt an issue was so important so threatening that it warranted 
talking directly with you the american people 
drugs have strained our faith in our system of justice our 
courts our prisons our legal system are stretched to the breaking 
point the social costs of drugs are mounting 
whos responsible everyone who uses drugs everyone who 
sells drugs and everyone who looks the other way 
in 1985 the government estimated that 23 million americans were 
using drugs on a current basis that is at least once in the 
preceding month 
last year that number fell by more than a third that means 
almost 9 million fewer americans are casual drug users because 
we changed our national attitude toward drugs casual drug use has 
declined 
there is also bad news very bad news roughly 8 million 
people have used cocaine in the past year almost 1 million of them 
used it frequently once a week or more 
to win that war against addictive drugs like crack will take 
more than just a federal strategy it will take a national strategy 
one that reaches into every school every workplace involving every 
family 
earlier today i sent our first such national strategy to the 
congress tonight im announcing a strategy that reflects the 
coordinated cooperative commitment of all federal agencies our 
weapons in this strategy are the law and criminal justice system 
our foreign policy our treatment systems and our schools and drug 
prevention programs 
let me address four of the major elements of our strategy 
first we are determined to enforce the law to make our streets 
and neighborhoods safe so to start im proposing that we more than 
double federal assistance to state and local law enforcement 
i am also proposing that we enlarge our criminal justice 
system across the board at the local state and federal levels 
alike we need more prisons more jails more courts more 
prosecutors im requesting altogether an almost 
billionandahalf dollar increase in drugrelated federal spending 
on law enforcement 
and while illegal drug use is found in every community nowhere 
is it worse than in our public housing projects that is why im 
targeting 50 million to fight crime in public housing projects to 
help restore order and to kick out the dealers for good 
the second element of our strategy looks beyond our borders 
in colombia alone cocaine killers have gunned down a leading 
statesman murdered almost 200 judges and seven members of their 
supreme court 
but you and i agree with the courageous president of colombia 
virgilio barco who said that if americans use cocaine then 
americans are paying for murder the 65 million emergency 
assistance announced two weeks ago was just our first step in 
assisting the andean nations in their fight against the cocaine 
cartels 
our strategy allocates more than a quarter of a billion dollars 
for next year in military and law enforcement assistance for 
colombia bolivia and peru this will be the first part of a 
fiveyear 2 billion program to counter the producers the 
traffickers and the smugglers 
i spoke with president barco last week and we hope to meet with 
the leaders of affected countries in an unprecedented drug summit 
im also asking the senate to ratify the un antidrug 
convention concluded last december 
to stop these drugs on the way to america i propose that we 
spend more than an billionandahalf dollars on interdiction 
our message to the drug cartels is this the rules have changed 
we will help any government that wants our help when requested we 
will for the first time make available the appropriate resources of 
americas armed forces we will intensify our efforts against drug 
smugglers on the high seas in international airspace and at our 
borders 
we will stop the flow of chemicals from the united states used to 
process drugs we will pursue and enforce international agreements 
to track drug money to the front men and financiers 
and then we will handcuff these money launderers and jail them 
just like any street dealers and for drug kingpins the death 
penalty 
the third part of our strategy concerns drug treatment experts 
believe that there are 2 million american drug users who may be able 
to get off drugs with proper treatment but right now only 40 
percent of them are actually getting help im proposing an 
increase of 321 million in federal spending on drug treatment 
fourth we must stop illegal drug use before it starts i am 
proposing a quarterofabilliondollar increase in federal funds 
for school and community prevention programs that help young people 
and adults reject enticements to try drugs every school 
college and university and every workplace must adopt tough but 
fair policies about drug use by students and employees those that 
will not adopt such policies will not get federal funds period 
as you can tell such an approach will not come cheaply last 
february i asked for a 700 million increase in the drug budget for 
the coming year over the past six months of careful study we have 
found an immediate need for another billionandahalf dollars with 
this added 22 billion our 1990 drug budget totals almost 8 
billion the largest increase in history 
the next fiscal year begins just 26 days from now so 
tonight im asking the congress to help us move it forward 
immediately 
we can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes or 
adding to the budget deficit to start congress needs not only 
to act on this national drug strategy but also to act on our crime 
package announced last may a package to toughen sentences to beef 
up law enforcement and build new prison space for 24000 inmates 
the states need to match tougher federal laws with tougher laws 
of their own stiffer bail probation parole and sentencing 
and we need your help if people you know are users help them 
get off drugs if you are a parent talk to your children about 
drugs if we fight this war as a divided nation then the war is 
lost but if we face this evil as a nation united this will be 
nothing but a handful of useless chemicals 
victory victory over drugs is our cause a just cause and with 
your help we are going to win

casual drug users could lose their cars be 
fired from their jobs pay stiff fines or suffer the embarrassment 
of having their names published in the newspaper in an antidrug 
society envisioned by president bush 
bush in an national drug strategy announced tuesday night 
called for more spending on law enforcement and drug treatment 
education and prevention he also earmarked 261 million next year 
to go after drug kingpins in colombia peru and bolivia the 
beginning of a 2 billion installment over five years 
but he also urged a crackdown on users including nonaddicts who 
take drugs for socalled recreational purposes 
american cocaine users need to understand that our nation has 
zero tolerance for casual drug use bush said in his nationally 
televised address 
he said the government will withhold federal funds from schools 
and colleges that dont have federally acceptable drug education and 
prevention policies 
many components in bushs drug strategy are merely 
recommendations others include federal funding proposals 
among the principal spending plans outlined for fiscal year 1990 
350 million for law enforcement grants to cities and states a 
200 million increase over the current authorization to get the 
money states must impose drug testing for arrestees prisoners 
parolees and those out on bail 
12 billion for construction of new federal prisons that 
money was already included in the crime package proposal he sent to 
congress earlier this year and is included in an overall 16 
billion figure for federal corrections spending 
925 million for drug abuse treatment a 53 percent increase 
from the current years 604 million authorization 
12 billion for prevention and education efforts 25 percent 
over the current authorization of 943 million 
261 million for military and law enforcement aid for the three 
south american countries that are the principal producers of 
cocaine more than four times the approximately 53 million they get 
in the current budget 
total foreign aid to those countries including the antidrug 
money is almost 163 million in 1989 the 261 million is part of a 
total 449 million to include economic aid that bush proposes for 
international antidrug efforts 
the 1990 proposal does not include the 65 million in military 
aid bush ordered for colombia last month the 2 billion envisioned 
for the three countries over a fiveyear period will be conditioned 
on evaluation of their efforts to quash the drug lords said 
national drug policy coordinator william bennett 
250 million for courts correctional institutions and 
alternatives to jail and prison such as boot camps and house arrest 
the total 79 billion package also includes 3 billion for 
border interdiction and other efforts including a campaign against 
moneylaundering 
marijuana eradication efforts would be doubled from 8 million to 
16 million 
giving a democratic response to bushs plan sen joseph biden 
ddel said the presidents plan is not tough enough bold 
enough to deal with the drug problems he accused bush of trying 
to fight the drug wars on the cheap 
the numbers in the 154page strategy reflect authorization 
figures not money that actually will be spent and they do not 
indicate where that money will come from for example because 
prisons take a long time to build only a small portion of the 12 
billion for prisons will be spent in 1990 
bush is calling on the states to stiffen penalties for users 
bennett explained the philosophy saying where this country 
got off track in the late 60s and 70s was believing the only people 
worthy of attention were the major traffickers and kingpins and not 
the individual users 
you can exercise sanctions without putting people in jail 
bennett said you can take away their drivers licenses you can 
fine them you can take away their automobiles if theyre using 
their automobiles to hide drugs or to store drugs you can notify 
their employers employers can fire them 
bushs strategy advocates imposition of such actions as well as 
publishing convicted drug users names in newspapers 
for the most hardened drug traffickers bush renewed his 
endorsement of the death penalty 
other components include 
tougher regulations for federal housing projects to expedite 
evictions of drug dealers and expand drug prevention programs for 
resident associations 
urging greater use of employee drug testing in state and local 
government and the private sector 
more federal money for community drug prevention efforts 
expanded research and information coordination to evaluate and 
develop more effective treatments

a highfiber diet appears to inhibit the growth 
of rectal polyps in people with an inherited tendency toward such 
polyps that can lead to cancer according to results of a fouryear 
study 
a team from memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york 
and cornell university medical college selected 58 study subjects 
from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis an inherited 
disorder characterized by a large number of polyps in the colon that 
almost always will progress to cancer without treatment 
the patients had had the colon the large bowel removed 
the report appearing tuesday in the journal of the national 
cancer institute used statistics to show that the ratio of rectal 
polyps to baseline was uniformly negatively correlated with high 
fiber that is the higher the fiber the fewer the polyps 
rectal polyps frequently decline spontaneously after removal of 
the large bowel in this disorder 
members of the high fibergroup consumed an average of 22 grams 
of fiber a day about twice what is contained in an average diet 
through the inclusion of special cereals in their diet only about 
10 percent of the population normally includes this much fiber 
several studies have suggested that highfiber lowfat diets 
might protect against cancer of the rectum and the bowel studies 
that follow patients on a prescribed diet for a long period four 
years for the nci group are rare however 
the results reported by these investigators are encouraging for 
the management not only of patients with familial adenomatous 
polyposis but also others at risk of developing colorectal cancer 
the second most frequent cause of cancer mortality in the united 
states said an editorial in the journal 
the researchers said it was not known whether the protective 
effect of grain fiber might also work in patients at risk for 
noninherited polyps enough correspondences exist between the two 
conditions to warrant active inquiry their report said 
the precancerous benign tumors that develop in the two forms of 
the disease are indistinguishable noted the team of researchers led 
by jerome j decosse

president bush will name james woolsey jr a 
conservative democrat and weapons specialist as the new us 
negotiator in 23nation talks to reduce nonnuclear forces in 
europe an official says 
security checks have begun on woolsey a lawyer chosen over two 
other candidates the official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said tuesday 
the other candidates were stephen ledogar a career diplomat who 
now holds the job and philip karber vice president of the bdm 
corp the official said 
the negotiations resume thursday in vienna between the 16nation 
north atlantic treaty organization and the sevennation warsaw pact 
ledogar who was appointed by president reagan in 1987 to help 
arrange the talks will remain in the post for the time being 
another official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
tuesday evening that nato would press hard in vienna for a treaty 
provision for the stationing of monitors in the two alliance areas 
across europe 
the washington post said in todays editions that the proposal 
would mean inspection of virtually every military installation from 
the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains dividing the european and 
asian parts of the soviet union 
the official also said nato was considering a proposal for the 
expansion of the existing eastwest requirements that each side 
notify the other of certain military maneuvers but questions 
remained unsettled about what equipment should be covered by the 
notice requirement and how big a maneuver area should be specified 
some compromises may have to be made on several questions 
we dont want to table something and then have a squabble 
within nato ranks the official said 
bush has raised expectations of an accord by the end of the year 
but that appears only a longshot possibility 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler declined to assess 
the prospects she said secretary of state james a baker iii had 
met friday and tuesday with aides to prepare for the resumption of 
negotiations 
the process of nominating woolsey and having him confirmed by the 
senate could take several weeks 
woolsey 48 has a reputation for political skill as well as 
weapons expertise he has close ties with sen sam nunn dga the 
chairman of the senate armed services committee while retaining the 
trust of defenseminded republicans 
he was undersecretary of the navy in the carter administration 
has served on the staffs of the national security council and the 
senate armed services committee and has worked at the pentagon 
as an occasional adviser to the reagan administration woolsey 
joined with brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser in 
recommending development of the midgetman missile a mobile 
singlewarhead longrange nuclear weapon 
in april bush decided to proceed with a plan to buy and deploy 
300 to 500 of the missiles on trucks and proposed that 50 mx 
missiles housed in underground silos be put on rail cars 
the cost of the two programs if congress provides the funds 
could exceed 40 billion

president bush is promising a 6yearold 
maryland boy named dooney that he wont have to be a drug dealer 
when he grows up 
not long ago i read a newspaper story about a little boy named 
dooney who until recently lived in a crack house in a suburb of 
washington dc bush said tuesday in a televised address on his 
national drug strategy in dooneys neighborhood children dont 
flinch at the sound of gunfire and when they play they pretend to 
sell to each other small white rocks they call crack 
life at home was so cruel that dooney begged his teachers to 
let him sleep on the floor at school and when asked about his 
future 6yearold dooney answers i dont want to sell drugs but 
i will probably have to 
bush after outlining his antidrug plan declared dooney does 
not have to sell drugs no child in america should have to live like 
this 
dooney waters was the subject of a washington post series in july 
that detailed the fear and filth he lived in with his drugaddicted 
mother 
my mother dont take care of me dooney told the post all 
she want is drugs 
the post stories told how dooney had to fend for himself in a 
home where drugs users slept dealers made their sales and police 
made arrests a reporter and photographer from the post spent two 
months observing dooneys life 
before the series ran dooneys 32yearold mother addie l 
waters checked into a treatment program to kick her drug habit and 
the boy went to live with his father

an estimated 4 million americans use illegal 
drugs more than 200 times each year and half are good candidates 
for professional treatment the bush administration says 
the national drug control strategy unveiled tuesday calls for a 
53 percent increase in federal funds for drug treatment from 604 
million in the current budget to 925 million in the next fiscal 
year 
the federal funds added to expected state and local 
contributions would increase the number of treatment slots from 
324000 to 650000 to 700000 said drug czar william bennett 
about 1 million people with serious drug problems could kick 
their habits on their own or with the help of friends family and 
clergy according to the strategy 
another million are so addicted so inclined this way no 
treatment and no kind of therapy is going to help them bennett 
said 
the strategy also calls for increasing the number of people 
getting treatment by urging states to consider expanding the use 
of civil commitment whereby addicts convicted of criminal offenses 
are sent by the courts to treatment facilities in lieu of or in 
addition to incarceration 
research indicates that voluntary and involuntary treatment 
patients do equally well 
only about 40 percent of those with the best chance of benefiting 
from drug treatment actually received such help in 1987 the 
strategy document said 
one of the problems with treatment is the lack of help available 
for cocaine addicts 
currently there are no proven successful treatment strategies 
comparable to those for heroin addiction the strategy said

along blue hill avenue where crack dealers openly 
sell their wares and women stake out corners to sell their bodies 
for drugs cynicism was rampant as president bush announced his 79 
billion plan to fight drugs 
it wont make any difference down here said ez ty 21 who 
interrupted a conversation on a dingy corner in the roxbury 
neighborhood to say he sells crack 
drugs is very heavy down here and you know why mcdonalds 
doesnt pay anything cocaine is here to stay its not going 
anywhere 
while he spoke ty who wore heavy gold jewelry around his neck 
reached under his sweatshirt to flash a chromeplated revolver stuck 
in his waistband 
its bull added 29yearold ronald gardner who said he uses 
and sells drugs theyre not going to get rid of it no way 
farther up the avenue of dirty vacant lots and boarded up 
storefronts two members of the humboldt raiders gang which police 
said is known for drug dealing declared bushs antidrug plan 
pointless the two wore fancy sweatsuits and heavy gold medallions 
i think its crazy said huckleberry ross 18 they ought 
to go right to colombia and do something it wont do any good to 
get rid of it here you wont keep the gangs from selling it 
ross friend and fellow gang member 19yearold tyrone stevens 
said the white house should focus on providing more educational 
opportunities for blacks to help keep them away from drugs 
they say theyre going to spend money to fight drugs but at the 
same time theyre taking money out of our public schools said 
stevens referring to the recent closure of several boston public 
schools we cant get no education so we all do what we know best 
try and make money off drugs 
three young boys walking down blue hill avenue who said they run 
drugs for dealers were as pessimistic as the others 
the gangsters all want to make money its bad said jerry 
tyler 14 the only way they the bush administration will do any 
good is to pay them off with more money 
about a mile down the street 37yearold billy bush sat among a 
group of men outside a convenience store and questioned the 
presidents plan 
there aint nothing he can do about the ghetto said the 
occasional sandblaster who acknowledged being a cocaine and heroin 
user he cant win theres 10 times more crack down here than 
heroin they stopped heroin a little bit but theyll never stop 
crack 
as he spoke he gestured to a young woman standing on a nearby 
corner waving at cars 
see women in the ghetto are selling themselves for base he 
said blacks are suffering because theyre strung out on base 
there aint nothing these guys can do they cant infiltrate the 
ghetto 
the conversation ended abruptly when an incoherent friend of his 
approached and tussled with an ap photographer tearing her strobe 
light from her grasp and running away

with a record 205 billion in ticket sales 
hollywood posted its best summer ever mainly on the strength of such 
films as batman and the family comedies honey i shrunk the 
kids and parenthood 
memorial day to labor day boxoffice revenues were up 20 percent 
from last summers record of 17 billion with batman emerging 
as at least the sixth most successful film in movie history on 
ticket sales in excess of 240 million 
the top five movies alone combined for more than 750 million in 
sales according to figures released tuesday 
nobody in the business can predict how big a movie goes once it 
goes big rob friedman president of worldwide advertising and 
publicity for warner bros said of batmans spectacular summer 
did we know batman was going to be a big movie yes did we know 
how big you never know 
john krier president of exhibitor relations co which compiles 
boxoffice figures said that batmans smash showing encouraged 
audiences to explore the entire summer slate 
and once people arrived there was a little bit of everything 
out there great variety he said 
among those contributing to the record season were adult 
moviegoers who in recent years have stayed at home although exact 
figures are unavailable it is believed older patrons boosted the 
grosses of dead poets society parenthood and honey i 
shrunk the kids 
the healthy summer season makes it likely that 1989 will break 
last years record of 446 billion 
five summer movies surpassed the 100 million mark batman 
indiana jones and the last crusade 1895 million lethal 
weapon 2 1313 million honey i shrunk the kids 1191 
million and ghostbusters ii 1099 million their combined 
788 million accounted for 40 percent of all summer tickets sold 
rounding out the top 10 were dead poets society 864 
million when harry met sally 666 million 
parenthood 641 million turner amp hooch 571 million 
and star trek v the final frontier 505 million 
among the highpowered flops were clint eastwoods pink 
cadillac 121 million sylvester stallones lock up 19 
million michael j foxs and sean penns casualties of war 
14 million and dennis quaids great balls of fire 137 
million 
several industry observers have pointed out that the summer 
record was sparked by higher ticket prices with some theaters in 
new york and los angeles charging 7 for single admissions 
but the studios counter todays movies must struggle for 
audiences in a more competitive marketplace fighting the broad 
appeal of pay cable television and videocassette rentals 
among the studios warner bros led all comers during the summer 
with its batman and lethal weapon 2 helping the studio 
account for 24 percent of all tickets sold 
disney with no sequels and no overpublicized epics quietly 
claimed the no 2 spot with its honey i shrunk the kids and 
dead poets society 
among the major studios tristar and mgmua had the most

an attorney for nazi war criminal john demjanjuk 
said tuesday new evidence that could help his client has been found 
in a garbage bin at the us justice department and he asked for a 
delay of at least six months in the case 
attorney yoram sheftel accused people in the department of 
concealing the evidence which he said includes testimony 
contradicting court rulings demjanjuk was responsible for gassing to 
death hundreds of thousands of jews in world war ii 
demjanjuk 69 a retired auto worker from a cleveland suburb was 
found guilty by an israeli court in april 1988 of crimes against 
humanity and crimes against the jewish people and sentenced to death 
his appeal was scheduled to be heard starting nov 1 in court 
petitions sheftel asked for a delay of at least six months citing 
documents he said were found in a garbage bin at the justice 
departments office of special investigations the office probes 
suspected nazi war criminals 
the israeli attorney accused the office of concealing important 
evidence on the one hand and falsifying other evidence in 
proceedings that stripped demjanjuk of us citizenship in 1981 
paving the way for his extradition to israel five years later 
there was no comment from the office a spokesman in washington 
did not immediately return a phone call from the associated press 
demjanjuks trial was israels first of an accused war criminal 
in 25 years 
witnesses identified him as a sadistic guard known as ivan the 
terrible who switched on the gas chambers at the treblinka death 
camp in nazioccupied poland where 850000 jews perished between 
1942 and 1943 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk claimed to be a victim of mistaken 
identity 
sheftel said in a telephone interview that the documents found 
were of decisive importance to the results of the appellants 
trial because they challenge important testimony identifying 
demjanjuk as ivan 
he said one document shows that a key witness former nazi prison 
guard otto horn failed to identify demjanjuk in a photo lineup 
during the trial the court was told horn did identify him 
another document would appear to challenge whether a witness at a 
1980 trial to strip demjanjuk of us citizenship recognized 
demjanjuk in a photo from a nazi identification card the attorney 
said the card was a key piece of evidence in the trial

when bombs are exploding in bogota and 
other colombian cities so is the multimilliondollar security 
business in this violent country 
a car bulletproofing plant in bogota recently was jammed to 
capacity with 20 vehicles being armored at 50000 to 60000 each 
the number of security companies in the city of 6 million people 
has grown to 315 from just 20 a decade ago and that is just the 
number legally registered with the defense ministry 
american and colombian businessmen are spending up to 1 million 
a year for personal security a former colombian army major now the 
vice president of a bogota security firm said in an interview 
the violence comes from many directions leftist guerrillas 
rightwing death squads revengeminded drug traffickers upset with 
the governments extradition plans and common criminals 
the former army majors security company offices were buzzing at 
7 am one recent day 
get two more men over there now he yelled to an assistant 
who had just received a call from a customer an american company 
for more protection 
we dont have enough men to fill all the jobs were being asked 
to do and new business is being turned away he said 
he asked that he and his company not be identified because he 
fears for the lives of his wife and 3yearold daughter 
the former major was an intelligence officer twice decorated for 
leading commandos that freed kidnapped people during states of siege 
in colombia and he has made a lot of enemies in his work against 
leftist guerrillas and common criminals 
he said there are about 2000 bulletproof cars in colombia many 
of them imported drug traffickers have bulletproof cars that are 
imported with bribe payments to customs officials he said 
a former us ambassador to colombia tom boyatt once told an ap 
reporter that it took the embassy months to import his 
bulletresistant v8 cadillac limousine because eightcylinder 
engines are prohibited in colombia 
they consume too much gas the government decided years ago 
at the car bulletproofing plant veimas the noise was deafening 
as employees swarmed around the cars pounding scraping sanding 
and sawing 
last year the company bulletproofed 80 cars said an execuctive 
with the company eugenio villegas business is increasing every 
year he said 
the cars are armored with combinations of quarterinch steel and 
woven materials the vehicles being armored during the visit were 
mostly fourwheel drive types used by security men who follow an 
executive and other guards in another bullet resistant car 
in bogota it is common to be forced off the road by cars crammed 
with men with submachine guns shotguns and pistols who are trying 
to stay on the bumper of the car they are protecting 
on almost every block of bogotas wealthy neighborhoods in the 
northern area of the capital guards can be seen on the streets in 
doorways and in cars 
some of the guards come from security companies that pay them the 
minimum wage of about 100 a month they typically look like 
gardeners armed with rusty singleshot shotguns 
others look more professional with modern weapons 
the 315 registered security companies in bogota offer bodyguards 
and home security systems 
every morning at private schools limousines pull up and the 
children who get out are surrounded by burly guards 
women on the way to the hair salon occasionally are seen 
accompanied by up to 10 men with submachine guns shotguns and 
pistols 
a few golfers at country clubs are accompanied by men carrying 
ingram submachine guns in leather briefcases that will flop open at 
the flick of a finger 
its tough to get a foursome together when your friends know 
someone might start popping away at you an american once told an 
ap reporter who was his golf partner

researchers found reassuring evidence that birth 
control pills havent raised the breast cancer risk for middleage 
women now they are starting a major new study to see if thats 
true for a younger generation 
birth control pills became available in the early 1960s and 
women now in their mid40s and 50s typically began using the pill 
when they were in their mid20s or beyond 
since then however millions of american women have begun taking 
the pill while still in their teens 
troubling data has begun to emerge that these people may be at 
substantially higher than usual risk of breast cancer 
it really becomes very important to either refute that or 
substantiate it in a clear way since that kind of use is routine 
for a large number of women said dr walter willett of the 
harvard school of public health if there is such a risk and it 
continues throughout life thats a major problem 
willett and his colleagues began mailing questionnaires this week 
to about 500000 nurses across the united states between ages 25 and 
42 
that study will be called the nurses health study ii and is a 
successor to a survey of 118273 female nurses between ages 30 and 
55 that began in 1976 
experts say the results of the first nurses study are reassuring 
for women now approaching menopause 
past use of oral contraceptives does not appear to increase the 
risk of breast cancer for women in their mid40s and 50s said 
willett 
the new study is the largest of a series of reports this year 
that have provided conflicting evidence about the possible role of 
the pill in triggering breast cancer 
breast cancer according to the american cancer society will 
kill an estimated 43000 people this year and follows lung cancer as 
the leading cancer killer of american women 
some doctors worry that taking the pill during the early 
reproductive years may somehow increase the risk others note that 
the amount and ratio of sex hormones in birth control pills have 
changed since their introduction in the early 1960s and this might 
also have made the pill more hazardous 
the epidemiologists are all confused myself included 
commented dr samuel shapiro of boston universitys sloan 
epidemiology unit 
shapiro was a coauthor of a study of pill users under age 45 
among those who took oral contraceptives for 10 years or more the 
risk of breast cancer was increased four times 
a study from university hospital in lund sweden found that 
women who took the pill while teenagers in the 1960s have about 
five times the usual risk of breast cancer before they reach 
menopause 
an oxford university study of women under age 35 who had been 
early pill users found a 74 percent increase in the breast cancer 
risk after eight years 
our study does not directly contradict those studies said 
willett it raises an element of doubt about them but there is no 
strong refutation because its possible that the effects really are 
different in very young women 
the newly released harvard study was published in todays issue 
of the journal of the national cancer institute willett said the 
massive amount of data collected provides a very clear and 
reassuring answer to the women of the age of those participating in 
the study 
fortyeight percent of the women had used oral contraceptives 
while 1799 of the total participants developed breast cancer there 
was no difference in the cancer rate between those who had taken the 
pill and those who did not 
the study found about a 50 percent increase in the risk among 
women who took the pill after age 40 willett said this was 
biologically interesting but not of great practical 
importance because the pill increases the heart attack risk among 
older women they are generally urged not to use the pill after age 
35 
in recent years birth control pills have been changed to reduce 
the amount and proportions of estrogen and progestin 
shapiro said the latest study is reassuring for women who took 
the early pills but he added the issue is what about the 
medicine that has been in use for the last 10 years this does not 
tell you very much about that they dont have much to contribute to 
whats going on at the moment

president bush has called for better 
coordination and advanced technology to stop the flow of cocaine 
but a new military headquarters on the battlefront shows the 
limitations of the armed forces 
joint task force 4 in key west is intended to coordinate 
information not only from all branches of the military but from the 
customs service the coast guard the drug enforcement 
administration and other civilian agencies 
but the center was forced upon a reluctant military by congress 
which designated the defense department as the lead agency for drug 
intelligence and backed that up with 450 million this year 
much of that information is to come from an array of equipment 
including radar balloons flying up to 15000 feet awacs planes with 
a radar radius of 250 miles or more other aircraft bristling with 
infrared cameras hydrofoils so fast their speed is classified and 
presumably satellite reconnaissance 
the centers secondincommand rear adm john pearson refuses 
to confirm whether the center uses satellites even though jtf4 has 
a satellite in its unit emblem 
the idea is for all agencies to forward data to jtf4 which then 
will monitor suspected smuggling boats and planes 
pearson said the center which began operations in the spring 
can track virtually every plane and boat that crosses the caribbean 
a similar center in alameda calif covers the west coast 
id be crazy to say an airplane literally cant fly into this 
country without being seen but i can offer that there would be 
damned few that werent seen the admiral said 
but beyond tracking what jtf4 must do is sort innocent 
traffic from suspicious targets then find someone in a position to 
board the boat or force down the plane 
resources to do that are meager as illustrated by the 
frustrations of an aerostat radar balloon ship operating out of key 
west said coast guard lt ronald kochan who heads that operation 
the ships balloon has an effective radar range of a little less 
than 60 miles and is usually stationed at ocean choke points 
through which seaborne drug boats must travel 
working with one cutter we might detect 37 targets a day and 
on an average maybe two are boarded he said wed have to bring 
the whole east coast coast guard down here to give us 10 cutters to 
work with 
the more sophisticated drug traffickers know the ships schedule 
anyway he said 
although jtf4 touts the coast guard balloons as one of the key 
sources for its radar data kochan told a dismayed group of visiting 
congressmen that no electronic connection exists between the ship 
and the new center 
he added that no plan existed to make such a connection and that 
there was no equipment for it and no budget to buy the necessary 
equipment in any case 
but the biggest question hanging over the center is whether its 
mission is even necessary 
with much fanfare the coast guard and customs have set up their 
own joint intelligence unit in dade county intended to do much the 
same thing as jtf4 
pearson identified that unit as one of jtf4s inputs but could 
not explain how the customs and coast guard role would differ with 
the presence of the military except to say those agencies may work 
a little closer to shore 
customs officials see little new in the military effort 
our role hasnt changed that much said robby viator of 
customs in miami a couple of years ago we were it now we have 
other players 
even the cia has gotten into the act in april the director set 
up the counternarcotics center with representatives from dea fbi 
customs coast guard and other federal agencies with a mission to 
advise policymakers on how to fight drug trafficking 
the proliferation of coordinators has some involved in the 
drug enforcement efforts disgusted although none will go on the 
record with their objections

addicts at a drug treatment center say 
president bush is leading the charge up the wrong hill in his war on 
drugs attacking cocaine and threatening prison when his program 
should focus on treatment 
frank terry and richard an alcoholic watched the speech in a 
room at the cedarssinai medical center which has a 27bed 
voluntary treatment program the patients spoke on condition that 
their last names not be revealed 
hes talking like hes talking to a bunch of schoolchildren 
said frank 33 who is being treated for his addiction to 
painkillers 
terry said bushs plan to spend 925 million for treatment of 
addicts was far too little 
he sounded like a thirdgrade schoolteacher said terry 34 
who is battling heroin he was banging those rocks on the table 
he didnt make it scary enough 
she referred to the plastic bag of rock cocaine the president 
used as a prop during the speech 
treatment is expensive street addicts are not going to be able 
to come to cedarssinai and the state programs are a joke she 
said 
he made one big blunder calling cocaine the nations no 1 
drug problem said dr ronald gershman medical director of the 
center for chemical dependency 
alcoholism is the no 1 drug in the nation i think they are 
being very narrow to focus all their attention on cocaine its a 
scapegoat said gershman who has been treating addicts for 15 
years 
gershman said americans face a flood of drugs including 
domestically made illegal amphetamines abuse of prescription drugs 
heroin from asia and mexico and socalled designer drugs such as 
ecstasy 
he talks about cocaine fields in colombia how about the 
california marijuana fields gershman asked 
the bottom lines on those programs is that they are 
ineffectual he said he missed the point what he outlined 
wont work drug treatment is laborintensive and expensive it has 
to be recognized as a major medical problem 
all three patients agreed that employee insurance should be 
mandated to cover treatment programs 
richard said he believed his employer a law firm used its 
employee health program to discover his alcohol addiction and find a 
way to fire him 
i thought my employer was backing me but they were really 
looking for any way they could to get rid of me he said 
the patients derided bushs proposal to increase the size of 
federal prisons and toughen sentences for drug users 
when you have an addiction you dont think about anything but 
the drug frank said 
the worst patient in our unit right now has spent most of his 
life in san quentin gershman said

president bushs plan of attack in the war on drugs will be no 
more than a quick fix unless neighborhoods across america rally to 
the cause say some state and local officials 
others found the 79 billion plan proposed in a nationally 
televised speech tuesday night too small for an allout war 
the presidents push drew plaudits from those on the drug front 
lines who have said they needed him in the fight 
maybe at last well have a nation that is dedicated to 
comprehensive solution and can get off the quick fixes and cliches 
like the death penalty said cary edwards former new jersey 
attorney general and author of the states comprehensive drug reform 
act of 1987 
bushs call for a battle fought block by block child by 
child struck a responsive chord in many communities 
in a druginfested chicago neighborhood leola spann director of 
the northwest austin council said residents have begun the fight 
i think communities are coming out and saying were going to 
take back our communities law enforcement knows were behind 
them said spann whose group has hung drugfree zone signs 
around a school 
florida gov bob martinez said bush was correct in saying that 
money was not the solution 
floridians have already spent tens of millions of dollars on 
the drug fight and the crime rate continues to rise the 
republican martinez said 
what the president emphasized tonight is that money alone is 
not going to win this fight what wins it is the will of the 
american people 
some said education remained the key to the drug war but los 
angeles police chief daryl gates said us troops also were needed 
i think youre going to see the need for the us military to 
become more actively involved gates said he advocated a 
friendly invasion of colombia and other drugproducing nations 
but miamibased us attorney dexter lehtinen whose office 
prosecutes more cocaine cases than any other advocated a fight 
focusing on cutting demand for drugs 
we are to blame not some latin american country until we 
realize that we will not be taking a realistic approach to cleaning 
up our own act he said 
bush for the first time pledged us military help to any 
government that requests it but most of his initiatives were close 
to home harsher penalties for users and more money for prisons 
treatment and education 
many said bushs plan offered too little 
i feel a little bit like the man whose house is burning down 
only to find that my nextdoor neighbor brought over a garden hose 
to fight the fire said california attorney general john van de 
kamp an expected democratic gubernatorial candidate 
new york gov mario cuomo said the presidents program provided 
little comfort to states 
local governments that are the front line in the war against 
drugs welcome the presidents concern but they would welcome more 
the resources needed to win this war before more of our children 
become casualties said cuomo a democrat 
boston mayor raymond flynn also a democrat found other faults 
he said the policy was an empty gesture because it doesnt 
provide for mandatory drug education in the schools mandatory 
treatment on demand for drug addicts or for mandatory federal prison 
sentences for convicted drug dealers 
some officials were already making plans for federal funds 
asked how he would use 1 million if the federal government 
granted it to his department to fight drugs st paul minn police 
chief william mccutcheon said he would give it to schools 
what we do in law enforcement is really shortterm he said 
we need to change attitudes we need to tell the young people 
theres something better than chemicals 
in california orange county sheriff brad gates said educational 
efforts should include corporations and churches he also said 
people should speak their minds on the issue 
you have to stick your head out the window and say im not 
going to take it anymore he said

a nuclearweapons protester said she was 
able to swim unnoticed into a topsecret navy research center and 
beat on a tridentmissilefiring submarine with a hammer before she 
was arrested 
jacqueline allen 24 of voluntown discussed the labor day 
attack on the moored uss pennsylvania after an appearance tuesday in 
us district court where she and six others were charged with 
trespassing on navy property and with destruction of government 
property 
they were released by a magistrate after signing promises to 
appear in court to face the charges 
allen said the protesters wanted to send a message to the navy 
that these weapons dont make us secure and you cant secure the 
weapons 
sen christopher j dodd dconn said the incident raises 
grave questions about security at the underwater systems center 
from a political standpoint you wouldnt want to equate an act 
of protest with an act of sabotage from a security standpoint 
however the fact that protesters could actually climb up on a 
nuclear sub at a naval installation suggests the potential for far 
more serious mischief 
security at the naval underwater systems center was appropriate 
and no investigation was planned said navy lt cmdr john ward a 
spokesman for the groton submarine base which has authority over 
security at the new london center 
the protesters swam and paddled in a blackened canoe to reach the 
sub at its berth at the new london center according to authorities 
and the protesters 
allen said she swam under the dock alongside the pennsylvania 
reached the sub at about midship poured a bottle of her blood on 
the hull scratched the word death in the paint and began 
pounding on the ship with a hammer she said it was the banging that 
caused the guards to notice her 
two other swimmers including anne montgomery a 62yearold 
roman catholic nun from new york were discovered shortly before 
they reached the sub the protesters said both pounded the hull 
with hammers an action meant to symbolize the biblical admonition 
to beat swords into ploughshares 
the submarine was not damaged and the protesters were prevented 
from boarding the navy said 
the ship is to be commissioned into the fleet on saturday 
the attack was similar to one seven years ago when nine 
antinuclear activists broke into a shipyard across the thames river 
from the research center and vandalized the trident submarine uss

us ambassador john mccarthy and his 
american staff were evacuated from lebanon early wednesday after 
hundreds of christians besieged the us embassy compound to protest 
washingtons policy in lebanon 
the 30 diplomats were taken by helicopter to cyprus because of 
deteriorating local circumstances no longer permitted the 
embassy to function effectively said keith peterson a spokesman 
for the us embassy in nicosia 
peterson stressed the united states of america is not 
abandoning lebanon dismissing accusations the traditionally 
proamerican lebanese christians have repeated in recent days 
he said the diplomatic staff would return when the situatioon 
permits the sudden decision to pull out of lebanon where 
christian forces and syrian troops have been fighting for six 
months came after supporters of christian army commander gen 
michel aoun surrounded the embassy on tuesday 
the protesters hoped to force the united states to take a tougher 
stance against syrias military presence in lebanon 
peterson added the personnel were evacuated to cyprus and are 
being flown from cyprus to their final destination he would not 
give details of their travel plans 
an army spokesman at aouns headquarters in the christian suburb 
of yarze said the american diplomats left aboard three helicopters 
unofficial sources in cyprus 100 miles west of lebanon said the 
aircraft had landed at akrotiri one of two british bases on the 
island officers at the base would neither confirm nor deny the 
report 
the lebanese army spokesman who insisted on anonymity said the 
americans had notified aoun of their intention to leave 
he said that after the departure of dependents and nonessential 
staff during the past six months of renewed fighting about a 
dozen americans had been left at the embassy 
beiruts leftist daily paper assafir had said tuesday that the 
us embassy has informed those concerned that it is prepared to 
close down if it comes under harassment it did not elaborate 
the christians besieging the embassy compound were angry at the 
united states for not coming to their aid against the syrian army 
and its moslem allies since hostilities began march 8 
since then fighting between the factions has clained the lives 
of 827 people and wounded 2452 
the siege reflected widespread anger among lebanons estimated 1 
million christians that the west has not come to their rescue they 
are trapped in a coastal enclave that is ringed by the syrians and 
their allies 
the crowd had on tuesday gone into a frenzy shouting we 
sacrifice our blood for you oh aoun mccarthy go home and 
the biggest catastrophe is mccarthy they waved placards and 
posters denouncing america 
christian sources said the embassy siege was designed by aoun to 
whip up antiamerican sentiment among christians inside and outside 
lebanon to bring pressure to bear on the united states 
the demonstrators said tuesday that their peaceful siege would go 
on until our demands are met 
they demanded that mccarthy submit his credentials to the 
legitimate lebanese authorities represented by general aoun and 
official us recognition of aouns authority 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem is competing 
for legitimacy with aouns threemember christian cabinet 
mccarthy who took up his post in september 1988 after the 
emergence of the dual government has not submitted his credentials 
to either cabinet he has publicly criticized syria for not 
responding to a us behest to negotiate with aoun but aoun has 
charged that washington is not turning sufficient heat on syria to 
soften its intransigence 
the demonstrators also demanded that washington dispatch an 
official delegate to lebanon on a factfinding mission like the 
soviets and french did and the lifting of the blockade imposed on 
the christians by the syrians 
the christian enclave has taken a fearful pounding from syrian 
artillery since yjr fighting broke out between aouns mainly 
christian forces and an alliance of syrian troops and druse 
miltiamen 
aoun launched his selfproclaimed war of liberation to force 
the syrians to withdraw their 40000 troops in lebanon 
even though his forces are outnumbered and outgunned his 
objective appeared to be to mobilize us and european support for 
the christians 
that startegy has patently failed washington has made 
sympathetic noises but has made it clear it has no intention of 
getting drawn into the lebanese quagmire again

salvadoran rebels have discarded previous 
conditions and accepted an offer by salvadors new rightist 
president to hold talks aimed at ending the countrys 10yearold 
civil war proposing they begin next week 
were taking away practically all obstacles ana guadalupe 
martinez a rebel commander told a mexico city news conference on 
tuesday 
there was no immediate response from the salvadoran government 
but it did announce a 48hour ceasefire to begin sept 14 and 
coincide with the celebration of central americas independence from 
spain in 1821 
if the salvadoran government agrees to peace talks it would be 
the first meeting between representatives of the belligerents since 
president alfredo cristiani took office june 1 and called for peace 
talks 
the guerrillas agreed at the time but the effort stalled because 
of a failure to agree on the details 
in a significant softening of previous rebel conditions ms 
martinez said the rebels would bargain with any committee the 
government names 
before they had insisted that an army representative and 
highlevel officials be at the negotiating table they rejected one 
delegation the government considered on grounds its members would 
not have the power to negotiate 
the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front represents 
five leftwing guerrilla groups that have been fighting a succession 
of usbacked salvadoran governments since 1979 
in announcing the ceasefire tuesday in el salvador col 
inocente montano the vice minister of defense did not mention the 
rebel proposal for peace talks but he but told reporters the 
ceasefire is a positive initiative as long as it is 
respected by the rebels 
a ceasefire for the independence festivities had been suggested 
monday by the permanent committee of the national debate for peace 
an organization representing more than 70 church union 
humanitarian and civic groups 
the government and rebel announcements followed a battle in 
northeastern el salvador tuesday in which at least 16 soldiers were 
killed salvadoran armed forces spokesmen reported the deaths and 
said the rebels also suffered numerous casualties 
the rebels suggested the period of sept 1014 as dates and 
mexico as a site for talks in a proposal sent to cristiani on friday 
through monsignor arturo rivera damas the roman catholic archbishop 
of san salvador ms martinez said 
she added the front has not received a reply from the government 
and said we think with this block of measures there has to be an 
answer before long 
but she said the rebels had received an unacceptable response to 
a proposal that the government release all wounded rebels it is 
holding as prisoners 
ms martinez said the proposal was made through rivera damas and 
the government replied that it would release the wounded prisoners 
if the rebels stopped sabotaging electrical installations and lifted 
their bans on transportatrion 
that point was not negotiable she said 
mario lopez another rebel commander told reporters new steps 
would be announced on thursday commanders will make public a 
series of measures to create an atmosphere of confidence for the 
negotiations he said 
he did not elaborate but there was speculation the steps might 
include a ceasefire in the past the guerrillas have opposed a 
unilateral ceasefire saying a truce would have be to be negotiated 
at the bargaining table 
the rebels in their proposal for talks next week held to their 
condition that rivera damas be present cristiani has said the 
archbishop should not be involved 
the rebels have also insisted that delegates from the 
organization of american states and united nations be present 
no agenda is being proposed for the talks ms martinez said 
because there has never been dialogue when topics have been 
fixed in advance 
three rounds of talks with the government of former president 
jose napoleon duarte between 1984 and 1987 failed to make any 
progress toward ending the nearly 10yearold war duarte headed a 
centrist christian democrat government 
an estimated 70000 people the majority of them civilians have 
been killed in the fighting

it took some imagination to envision two 
industrial sites and a cornfield as home to glittering gambling 
casinos 
but all it really will take is money 
you could put grass on that and make it look like a pasture 
said steve norton executive vice president of resorts 
international after viewing the sites with a legislative study 
committee 
the committee tour was part of a daylong hearing tuesday on 
legislative efforts to bring casino gambling to the citys ailing 
economy 
mayor thomas v barnes who contends that casinos could bring 
thousands of jobs and 60 million in tax revenues said the 
90minute tour gave legislators firsthand knowledge of the sites 
from then on its up to us to build our case for revenue and 
job potential he said 
the move faces continued opposition 
we need to be capitalizing on the strengths of people not on 
their weaknesses the rev william d booth said before a meeting 
of the study committee reviewing casino legislation 
booth said the lure of jobs and tax revenue hides the reality of 
family disruption and wasted money brought on by gambling 
we dont believe we will build a great city or build a great 
people bringing into our circumstance this kind of enterprise he 
said 
booth is a cochairman of no casinos for gary a church 
basedorganization seeking oppostion votes in a nonbinding 
referendum 
barnes has been rallying votes for the nov 4 referendum while 
urging the general assembly to pass laws permitting casino gambling 
in gary 
resorts international operates a casino in atlantic city nj 
and joined gary officials earlier this year in an unsuccessful 
effort to win approval for casino gambling in indiana 
the general assembly earlier this year approved the referendum 
for gary after rejecting the broader legislation

the dollar rose during trading to a twomonth high 
against the yen today but closed unchanged while share prices on 
the tokyo stock exchange declined 
the dollar opened at 14690 yen slightly above tuesdays close 
of 14665 yen and rose rapidly to 14738 yen despite repeated 
interventions by the bank of japan during morning trading currency 
dealers said 
it was the first time the dollar rose above 14700 yen since june 
15 when it closed at 15030 yen 
the dollar turned bearish in the afternoon however following 
speculation that japan may increase its interest rates the dealers 
said it closed at 14665 yen unchanged from tuesdays close 
the dealers attributed the dollars strength in the morning to 
the continued strong performance of the us economy and reduced 
anxiety about inflation 
when it passed the 147yen mark the traders in the market were 
beginning to feel it may be rising too fast said a dealer at 
daiichi kangyo bank who spoke on condition of anonymity then the 
rumor about an interestrate increase hit the market 
he said a report that quoted bank of japan gov satoshi sumita as 
saying the central bank would take every possible measure to stop 
the yens slide was taken as a warning of an interest rate increase 
dealers also said the dollars firmness followed its surge in the 
new york market tuesday despite concerted interventions by central 
banks in the united states and europe

surpass the 150yen mark before long said the dealer at daiichi 
kangyo

issues a 4183point loser tuesday shed another 17064 points or 
048 percent to close at 3427131

taipei taiwan ap a chinese air force pilot flew his mig19 
jet fighter to the nationalistheld offshore island of quemoy today 
the defense ministry said 
lt chiang wenhao 24 landed his fighter this afternoon after a 
flight from longxi airport in chinas southern fujian province the 
ministry said in a statement 
chiang from the central chinese province of sichuan was 
attached to the 49th chinese air force division the statement said 
the pilot is the first chinese airman to defect to taiwan since 
the june 34 bloody suppression of a prodemocracy movement in china 
the last chinese pilot to defect to taiwan liu chihyuan now 
30 also flew a mig19 when he fled in 1987 
the nationalist government rewarded him with 412 pounds of gold 
then valued at about 3 million he is now a member of taiwans air 
force 
the taiwan government has a sliding scale of gold rewards for 
chinese military defectors calculated on the type of aircraft they 
bring out 
officials said 14 chinese military personnel have defected to 
taiwan since 1949 when the nationalists retreated to taiwan after 
losing a civil war to the communists on the chinese mainland 
seven of the 14 flew planes to south korea the only asian nation 
that has diplomatic ties with the nationalists they were eventually 
allowed to settle in taiwan but south korea kept the planes 
since the june crackdown dozens of chinese have arrived in 
taiwan in boats claiming they wanted a better life but they were 
sent back to the chinese mainland officials said they could not be 
classified as defectors 
last month a chinese youth seeking political asylum in south 
korea was given a taiwan passport and later left for el salvador 
observers say the nationalists are reluctant to accept chinese 
political refugees for fear the action would outrage chinese 
authorities

black leaders told a judge that minorities in 
dallas have trouble gaining power within city government because the 
election system is biased 
qualified black candidates typically have been beaten in city 
council elections by whites because one face was black and the 
other was white eddie bernice johnson a state senator from 
dallas testified tuesday at the opening of a federal trial 
two unsuccessful black council candidates and an hispanic group 
have charged in a lawsuit that dallas apportionment system 
particularly the use of atlarge districts has resulted in the 
underrepresentation of the minority community 
the current council governing a population estimated to be 51 
percent minorities consists of nine nonhispanic whites and two 
blacks 
the plaintiffs are asking us district judge jerry buchmeyer to 
order a restructuring voters approved a new structure last month 
and some attorneys say the case jeopardizes the plan that was 
approved overwhelmingly by voters 
the plaintiffs would like the city to be apportioned in 15 
singlemember districts their attorneys said 
the city said the voters right to pick their system of 
government is at stake and its attorneys dispute charges that the 
current system is discriminatory 
in the last 14 elections since 1983 the black preferred 
candidate has been successful in nine races paul pearce an 
attorney for the city said during opening arguments 
johnson and state rep fred blair of dallas criticized the use of 
atlarge districts which they said sap the voting strength of 
minorities 
the atlarge structure is a convenient way of maintaining 
control of the city of dallas atlarge council members dont make 
themselves available to the concerns of the entire city blair 
said 
last month dallas voters adopted a socalled 1041 council 
structure with 10 members elected from single districts four from 
quadrants or super districts and the mayor atlarge 
pearce sought a dismissal of the case because the us justice 
department has not approved the plan buchmeyer rejected the motion 
saying he would not rule on the viability of the plan 
under dallas current system eight members are elected from 
singlemember districts and three including the mayor are elected 
atlarge

a nasa engineer has proposed a relatively 
quick cheap way to send a spacecraft to pluto the only unexplored 
planet in the solar system 
robert farquhar who manages the small missions program at nasa 
headquarters in washington said a rocket designed to send a probe 
to the sun also could hurl an unmanned spaceship to pluto 
its a free ride he said in an interview in tuesdays los 
angeles times 
voyager 2s flight past neptune last week leaves pluto the only 
planet unvisited by a spacecraft from earth there are no plans for 
a pluto mission and such a flight wont be financially feasible for 
decades officials of the national aeronautics and space 
administration have said 
farquhar who masterminded the flight of the first spacecraft to 
visit a comet said his proposal would allow a probe to be launched 
toward pluto within about a dozen years and for less than 150 
million thats cheap compared with the twinspacecraft voyager 
mission that visited four planets for 865 million 
nasa plans to send a probe through the suns searing atmosphere 
right after the turn of the century 
to approach the sun at an angle that would allow scientists to 
monitor the probe throughout its flight it first would have to be 
carried around jupiter 
farquhar said a lightweight pluto probe could be carried on the 
same titan rocket once they reach jupiter the probes would part 
for their respective targets the pluto probe given a boost by 
jupiters gravity would reach pluto around 2014 
pluto normally is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun 
but neptune now is temporarily in that position because of plutos 
elongated elliptical orbit 
farquhars proposal is a very interesting possibility said 
physicist bruce tsurutani of nasas jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasadena who is planning the solar probe tsurutani said farquhars 
proposal should receive strong consideration 
physicist alan stern a university of colorado expert on pluto 
said the proposal is feasible he suggested that any joint 
solarpluto mission be named fire and ice 
if farquhars proposal is accepted it wont be the first time 
one of his ideas gains favor farquhar and the late fred scarf a 
physicist with trw inc in redondo beach persuaded nasa a few years 
ago to redirect an aging spacecraft toward comet giacobinizinner 
the international sunexplorer 3 which had finished its main 
mission of studying the solar wind was renamed the international 
cometary explorer and became the first to visit a comet the probe 
arrived at giacobinizinner in 1985 just before five european and 
japanese spacecraft visited halleys comet in 1986 
farquhar said he devised his pluto proposal while examining plans 
for the solar probe nasa has made that probe a highpriority 
mission because the sun has been relatively neglected in space 
exploration 
under farquhars proposal the pluto probe would contain a 
camera a dust counter an instrument to study the planets 
atmosphere and radio gear for communication and other studies the 
spacecraft also might send a package of instruments to plutos 
surface as it darted past the planet

a twa airliner with 151 passengers dived to 
avoid colliding with a military plane at 37000 feet slightly 
injuring five people authorities said 
across the state an air midwest commuter plane carrying seven 
passengers and two crewmen made a successful belly landing tuesday 
night at kansas city international airport officials said the 
plane skidded 1000 feet but no one was injured 
twa flight 818 a boeing 767 bound nonstop for paris took its 
evasive action south of lake michigan tuesday as it approached 
detroit airline spokesman don morrison said 
morrison said a chicago air traffic controllers instructions put 
the twa jetliner on a collision course 
but a spokesman for the federal aviation administration disputed 
morrisons claim 
we have no knowledge of air traffic controllers being 
involved faa spokesman mort edelstein said 
the faa said it will review voice tapes and radar recordings to 
determine circumstances surrounding tuesdays incident 
a flight attendant and four passengers were hurt late tuesday 
all but one of the injured had been released from hospitals where 
they were treated for bruises and minor cuts 
flight 818 had been gone about 45 minutes following its afternoon 
takeoff from lambert st louis international when its pilot came 
into contact with chicago air controllers morrison said 
the pilot was given a vector change a direction change by the 
air traffic control system morrison said he made that change 
until situated at 37000 feet which was his assigned altitude 
morrison said 
as he made the turn he noted immediately in front of him an 
airplane a foreign aircraft he immediately dropped altitude to 
avoid the aircraft he avoided the aircraft went underneath it 
morrison said 
edelstein said the incident involved the twa plane and a military 
aircraft and was not being classified immediately as a near 
collision the type of military plane was not immediately identified 
the last we knew the planes were eight miles part edelstein 
said why he took evasive action we wont know until we talk with 
the pilot 
morrison said most of flight 818s passengers were boarded other 
flights to paris 
in kansas city the landing gear of the air midwest commuter 
failed to extend and lock in place properly authorities said the 
twinengine turboprop fairchild metro skidded 1000 feet on the 
runway before coming to a stop 
authorities said foam was used on the runway to prevent fire in 
case of a fuel leak

a jury convicted a factory worker in a 
failed plot to blow up salem with 13 bombs that were planted around 
the southern indiana city last year 
the us district court jury deliberated for a little more than 
seven hours before finding jerry a conrad 42 of salem guilty of 
all 29 counts against him he faces up to 285 years in prison 
defense attorney michael mcdaniel said he planned to appeal the 
conviction 
as he heard the verdict conrad slumped in his chair and his 
mouth sagged one juror wept 
my husband is innocent and this is not over said the 
defendants wife rose mary as she left the courtroom 
conrad made no comment to reporters as federal marshals led him 
from the courthouse 
we were confident from the outset the jury would convict on all 
29 counts assistant us attorney robert stanley powell told 
reporters the evidence in this case was overwhelming 
us district judge sarah evans barker set no sentencing date 
mcdaniel said conrad probably would not be sentenced until after 
the trial of john m hubbard iii also charged in the case 
hubbards trial is set for oct 2 and conrad is expected to testify 
conrad and hubbard 31 also of salem were charged with 14 
counts of making bombs 13 counts of attempting to destroy bridges 
and buildings used in interstate commerce and one count each of 
illegal possession of dynamite and conspiracy 
the bombs were found stashed behind buildings and beneath bridges 
july 5 1988 the government contends they were placed in the 
downtown area partly because of hubbards feeling of rivalry for 
state rep frank newkirk jr who also is the son of salems mayor 
the largest bomb was found behind newkirks law office 
ladies and gentlemen make no mistake about it these were bombs 
that were meant to go off and were meant to cause death and 
destruction assistant us attorney linda s chapman said in 
closing arguments tuesday 
but for the grace of god salem would have been literally blown 
off the map that day she told the jury 
three of the bombs ignited and fizzled but none exploded and no 
one was hurt 
during the trial the government described conrad as a 
survivalist who collected books on making explosives but suggested 
no other motive for his role in the bomb incident

a soviet trawler collided with a finnish 
tanker and sank in the baltic sea today and the coast guard said 
the only soviet sailor who was able to abandon ship died after being 
pulled from the water 
the other 14 soviet crewmen were missing and presumed dead 
only one man probably the radio operator had managed to get 
into the water but he died upon arrival at the hospital said 
waldemar berlin head of coast guard rescue operations 
ive worked here for 30 years and i cant recall a more serious 
accident in the baltic he said 
the tanker tebo star collided with the trawler labushkino at 
1211 am 32 miles southwest off the swedish island of gotland 
the soviet trawler sank within minutes berlin said and some 
wreckage and an oil slick was all that marked the site 
by this morning the search was scaled down to virtually 
nothing berlin said the operation had involved three navy 
helicopters four naval vessels and 14 trawlers from the soviet port 
of kaliningrad that had been fishing in the area 
the soviet new agency tass in a brief dispatch from moscow gave 
generally the same details but said the search continued for the 
fishermen 
the cause of the accident was not known the weather was fair and 
winds were moderate at 27 mph 
the 6000ton tebo star sent out a distress signal immediately 
after colliding with the 75footlong labushkino a nearby soviet 
trawler the matrosova picked up the fatally injured sailor more 
than an hour after the accident 
according to rescue workers the finnish tanker veered to avoid a 
collision with another soviet trawler when it hit the labushkino 
searchers found four empty life rafts but they were detached 
automatically and no one had had the time to go into them berlin 
said 
a finnish report broadcast on swedish radio said the soviet 
trawler might have had its lights turned off at the time 
berlin said west german authorities will question the crew of the 
tebo star which suffered no damage when it arrives in kiel 
thursday morning the tanker then will continue to its original 
destination amsterdam 
berlin said no official explanation was expected before the 
tanker returned to the finnish capital of helsinki

only hours after their attorneys won a round in 
court editors of the dallas times herald explained to readers why 
some regular features were missing from the newspaper 
a federal judge in kansas city mo late tuesday denied 
universal press syndicates request to prevent the times herald from 
printing 26 comic strips and columns the dallas morning news wants 
exclusively 
but because an agreement between the syndicate and the times 
herald permitting publication of the features expired tuesday the 
newspaper was forced to pull the features from todays editions 
a note accompanied the frontpage story that apprised of the 
development in kansas city in it the editors informed readers 
of the ongoing litigation and the absence of the features they 
asked that readers accept our apology and be assured that we will 
continue to fight to return all your favorite features to the dallas 
times herald 
in the section where readers were accustomed to finding dear 
abby the bold type read thanks for reading dear abby in the 
dallas times herald for the past 31 years below that the 
newspaper printed we apologize for being unable to bring our 
loyal readers dear abby in its usual place today we are fighting in 
court to return it to you the editor 
other boxed messages with apologies were on the comics pages 
where eight universal press comic strips usually appear 
universal press syndicate has reached an agreement with the ah 
belo corp owner of the morning news that would give the newspaper 
exclusive dallasarea rights to the comics and features which 
include dear abby and doonesbury 
universal press had filed a lawsuit and sought a preliminary 
injunction to prevent the times herald from using its comics and 
features beyond the cancellation date 
on tuesday us district judge d brook bartlett said he would 
not approve the injunction because kansas citybased universal press 
had not convinced him one was necessary 
universal press will continue fighting any efforts the times 
herald might make in state courts to print the ups features said 
david oliver an attorney for the syndicate 
if we learn that tomorrow there are universal press features in 
the times herald then the times herald has run those features 
without our consent and without a state order oliver said that 
would be a copyright infringement and we would be right back here 
in federal court 
times herald editor roy bode said the newspaper has no intention 
of using the material beyond the cancellation dates without the 
permission of universal press or a legal authority 
but he added its an extraordinary thing for a syndicate to 
withdraw its strips from one paper to take them to another paper i 
dont think its a reputable practice 
john mcmeel president of universal press said his company had a 
30day cancellation agreement on most of the comics and features 
with the times herald the cancellation date for all but two of the 
comics and features was saturday but lawyers for the newspaper and 
the syndicate agreed that the times herald could carry the material 
through tuesdays hearing 
there was a 90day cancellation agreement for doonesbury the 
popular pulitzer prizewinning strip and another comic which runs 
through nov 1 
the times herald has sued in texas state court seeking to prevent 
its rival from gaining exclusive dallasarea rights to the universal 
press material

nbc television has asked an abcowned production 
company to create and produce a primetime drama series it would be 
the first time one tv network has produced a show to run on a rival 
network 
the offer of the deal comes as federal regulations governing 
television are being lifted sparking changes in the traditional 
networkstudio relationship of television production said brandon 
stoddard head of abc productions 
stoddard said he is considering the request by nbc for a drama 
series that would air in a 10 pm slot as well as a miniseries 
the new york times reported in todays editions 
stoddard said he expected in five to seven years a network 
studio system would develop in which the networks will produce 
more of their programming 
in 1990 a limit of five hours of primetime programming produced 
by the networks will be lifted the new rules have prompted the 
three networks to seek more of their own progamming 
in the past the major hollywoodbased production companies such 
as warner brothers inc universal and paramount produced the 
majority of programming seen on television 
hollywoodbased studios can reap high profits from syndicating 
their programs the networks have been prevented from taking a 
percentage of the profits from the syndication sales 
congress has asked the networks and the studios to reach a 
compromise

an explosion and fire wrecked part of a 
topsecret iraqi missile plant last month killing at least 700 
people and wounding up to 1800 dissident iraqi sources and british 
news reports said today 
there was no confirmation of their reports from officials in 
baghdad the iraqi capital iraqs statecontrolled media has made 
no mention of a major explosion in the area 
but western diplomats reached by telephone in baghdad confirmed 
there was an explosion at the heavily guarded facility more than two 
weeks ago the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they could give no details 
such an explosion would be the worst disaster of its kind 
reported in iraq there was no word on its cause and no immediate 
indication of sabotage 
londons independent daily quoting unidentified diplomats and 
middle east sources said today the conflagration killed 700 people 
when it engulfed the plant south of baghdad the iraqi capital on 
aug 17 
the british broadcasting corp reported that egypts defense 
ministry confirmed there was a big explosion at the facility with 
many casualties 
the iraqis with egyptian help are believed to be developing a 
modified version of argentinas mediumrange condor2 
surfacetosurface missile known as the badr2000 at the huge 
plant between alhillah and addiwaniyeh 40 miles south of baghdad 
the complex protected by an elite military force reportedly 
covered 970 square miles indicating it included a missile 
testfiring range sources said it is run by iraqs ministry for 
military industries 
an official of the patriotic union of kurdistan an outlawed 
kurdish movement fighting the baghdad government told the 
associated press in a telephone interview that sources inside iraq 
said 700 bodies have so far been recovered 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
casualty toll from the night explosion and fire could be as high as 
2500 dead and wounded 
the independent reported that the casualties included egyptian 
personnel who were flown to cairo in three egyptian air force 
transports on aug 18 the daily quoted egyptian sources as saying 
the casualties were taken to the maadi military hospital in cairo 
the dissident groups official said the explosion at the plant 
touched off a huge fire that destroyed at least 30 percent of the 
complex which includes laboratories missile factories and living 
quarters for workers 
the iraqis used firefighting aircraft to battle the flames but 
they were not able to bring it under control until aug 25 the 
sources said the number of personnel at the complex was not known 
other kurdish sources linked to other rebel groups fighting 
baghdad for an autonomous homeland in northern iraq said the 
facility included a chemical weapons factory and that some of the 
casualties had wounds consistent with contact with chemical agents 
there was no independent confirmation of that report but iraq is 
known to have several plants producing chemical and nerve gases 
the united nations blamed iraq several times for using chemical 
weapons outlawed under a 1925 geneva accord during the 8year war 
with iran 
western military analysts have been reporting for months that the 
iraqis were developing the badr 2000 to carry nuclear and chemical 
warheads with a range of up to 620 miles 
the project has alarmed the israelis because it would allow iraq 
to hit targets inside the jewish state 
the israeli air force destroyed a nuclear reactor near baghdad in 
june 1981 in a longrange air strike israel said that plant was 
close to being able to produce nuclear weapons 
the israelis have said that west german french and italian 
companies have been involved in the badr 2000 project 
prosecutors in munich reported earlier this year that they were 
investigating several west german companies for possible illegal 
exports of technology to iraq for missile development

georges simenon creator of the french detective 
inspector maigret and the most widely published author of the 20th 
century has died at his swiss home in lausanne it was announced 
today he was 86 
simenon died monday night according to a lausanne funeral home 
pompes funebres generales his family gave instructions for a 
private funeral today a spokesman for the funeral home said on 
condition of anonymity 
no cause of death was given but simenon had been ailing for some 
time he died peacefully a spokeswoman at his lausanne office said 
the author stipulated that his ashes join those of his daughter 
and favorite child mariejo under a 250yearold cedar outside his 
house she committed suicide in 1978 at age 25 
i dont fear death but i fear causing trouble by my death to 
those who survive me simenon once said i would like to die as 
discreetly as possible 
jean richard the french actor who played inspector maigret in 
dozens of television films over 23 years said of simenon for me 
he was the greatest popular french author without comparison he was 
the new balzac 
the official soviet news agency tass eulogized simenon in a brief 
obituary as a master detective story writer maigret the 
contemplative paris policeman is a favorite of millions of soviets 
some of his adventures were recently reprinted by the popular weekly 
magazine ogonyok 
a belgian native simenon wrote 80 books featuring maigret the 
compassionate pipesmoking paris chief inspector who seeks to 
understand criminals rather than condemn them 
while best known for the immensely popular maigrets he 
personally preferred the 132 nonmaigrets psychological 
sometimes nightmarish novels about people in crisis that put his 
name into literary encyclopedias 
his books were translated into 55 languages including chinese 
armenian and yiddish in 40 countries in the soviet union some of 
his novels had initial editions of 500000 copies and his revealing 
letter to my mother is obligatory reading in frenchlanguage 
school lessons 
at the start of his career simenon also wrote about 300 pulp 
fiction novels under more than 20 pseudonyms 
a 1973 survey by unesco said sales of simenon books totaled more 
than half a billion worldwide the books provided the basis for 52 
feature movies and more than 300 television films charles laughton 
jean gabin and heinz ruehmann were among the 22 actors who played 
maigret 
about 50 biographies have been written about simenon his paris 
editor published 21 volumes of dictees dictations transcripts 
of reflections and reminiscences taperecorded during an eightyear 
period when simenon suffered from an ear condition that upset his 
sense of balance 
apart from writing which he called forced labor simenon 
said he spent most of his life obsessed by a frantic sexuality 
in two 1977 interviews he said he had slept with 10000 women 
sometimes at the pace of three a day to learn the truth about 
the woman 
his fortune is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
and a battle could develop over it his will he told the belgian 
newspaper le soir in 1978 would be so precise that many people 
will be shocked 
to avoid a costly settlement he refused to divorce his second 
wife denise 
simenon stipulated that his ashes join those of his daughter and 
favorite child mariejo under a 250yearold cedar outside his 
house she committed suicide in 1978 at age 25 
in 1981 his intimate memoirs came out by far the thickest 
book to carry his name which he said would be the last to be 
published during his lifetime 
it was sparked by the suicide of his daughter and tells a 
tempestuous story of despair and happiness of love and sex of 
luxury and the longing to return to what he calls the little 
people of his home country 
simenon was repeatedly said to be a candidate for the nobel prize 
in literature 
a friend the late french nobel laureate andre gide described 
simenon as the most novelistic of novelists in french literature 
today 
the older of two children simenon was born feb 13 1903 in the 
belgian town of liege shortly after midnight on a friday but his 
superstitious mother of upperclass dutchgerman ancestry had the 
date officially registered as feb 12 
the mother outwardly fretful but inwardly ironwilled left a 
deep imprint on his work as revealed in pedigree a first 
autobiography covering his youth and in letter to my mother 
his father who suffered from a heart condition was an 
unambitious insurance company clerk of breton descent 
simenon quit school at 16 going to work as a bakers apprentice 
and a bookstore clerk before becoming a reporter for a local 
newspaper that career ended after a satire on his superiors and his 
family including his wealthy uncle who never spoke to him again 
after the death of his father simenon moved to paris in 1922 and 
began churning out novels at a rate of 80 pages a day chiefly for 
consumption by housewives he wrote anything that sold from 
sentimental stories to adventure books and travelogues drawing his 
basic information from the larousse encyclopedia 
in three years he made enough to rent a chic apartment and own a 
chauffeurdriven car and a yacht his first efforts in serious 
literature drew encouragement from the french writer colette then 
literary editor of the le matin newspaper 
after world war ii he lived for several years in the united 
states and canada where he produced some of his finest works in 
the early 1960s simenon reached a furious peak writing up to six 
books a year 
in the united states he divored his frenchborn first wife of 27 
years regine and married denise quimet a canadian they settled 
in epalinges switzerland in a 26room mansion 
in his intimate memoirs simenon described that marriage as 
an infernal symphony that once made him so desperate he 
contemplated suicide the two separated in 1969 with her drawing 
alimony payments he said were higher than the salary of a french 
prime minister 
for most of his life he remarked in one dictee simenon was 
obsessed by a frantic sexuality 
only after meeting teresa denises veniceborn chambermaid who 
was 20 years his junior did he find complete harmony he 
related once they moved into the maison rose at lausanne a 
plainly furnished farmhouse dwarfed by highrise condominiums and 
the 250yearold cedar 
simenon is survived by teresa denise and his first wife regine

dutch voted today in a 
parliamentary election that was expected to return longtime premier 
ruud lubbers to power but force him to veer to the left in order to 
form a government 
voter turnout appeared to be high in crisp autumn weather 
in amsterdam polling stations reported that 22 percent of the 
electorate had cast ballots within the first three hours after polls 
opened in rotterdam that figure was 15 percent 
lubbers the nations highly popular premier who has led the 
government since 1982 was expected return to office for a third 
term 
but preelection polls predicted that lubbers a centrist may 
have to turn to the opposition labor party to form a new coalition 
government 
that would result in a swing to the left that could herald an 
easing of his sevenyear program of austerity and fiscal reform 
a lastminute opinion poll conducted tuesday night indicated 
that although lubbers christian democrats would win 56 seats in the 
150member dutch parliament up two from their current strength his 
rightwing liberal coalition partner would loose at least five of 
its 27 seats 
the poll by the maurice de hond polling organization predicted 
that the leftist labor party will remain at 52 seats while the 
centerleft democrats 66 party was expected to win three seats on 
top of their current nine 
the green left an environmentalist coalition of four leftwing 
fringe parties will jump from three to eight according to the 
telephone poll 
such results would make labor the obvious coalition partner for 
the christian democrats though lubbers said this week that a labor 
victory would bring bad politics he has not ruled out forming a 
coalition with any group 
voting booths where the 10millionmember electorate had a 
choice of 22 parties were scheduled to close at 7 pm 1 pm 
edt the first election returns were expected about an hour later 
lubbers centerright government fell on may 2 in a dispute over 
an ambitious plan to clean up the heavily polluted dutch air soil 
and waterways by the year 2010 a general election had been 
scheduled for may 1990

pete curley was pleased to supply the 
slobbering but lovable canines for tom hanks film turner and 
hooch but hes not all that happy when moviegoers drive to his 
home hoping to see his dogues de bordeaux 
its when they pull into the driveway and run around the yard 
that i stick my head out the window and say its not open to the 
public curley said 
he became something of a sensation among his neighbors in rural 
merrimac after they saw him interviewed on cable television about 
his contribution to the movie

who reluctantly takes in a brown and white dog named hooch after its 
owner is murdered three of the four large jowly dogs sold to the 
moviemakers by curley portrayed hooch in various scenes a 
4monthold pup also appeared in the film 
curley 34 said the sale to disney studios was a real boost to 
his principal business the import and export of rare breeds 
but the movie has led to many calls from people who really 
shouldnt own a dogue de bordeaux he said 
there are a lot of people who want to buy them for all the 
wrong reasons he said for some people its a macho thing 
if someone asks how hard the dog will bite i dont sell him a dog 
the question represents a misunderstanding of the dogs real 
nature he said yes theyre very good guard dogs but theyre 
also extremely tolerant of children he said 
curley said that from his first glimpse of a dogue de bordeaux 
which is the national watchdog of france during a peace corps stint 
in guatemala after graduating from the university of 
wisconsinstevens point he knew he wanted to own a dog like that 
after the peace corps he was determined to do something that 
allowed him to work with animals and to travel he started to breed 
bull mastiffs 
about eight years ago he borrowed 1800 flew to france and 
bought his first dogue de bordeaux last september his 
prizewinning auriela was named best of show at ernee france 
im an american and i beat them on their own turf he said

police are expected to recommend that six 
israeli reserve officers accused of training colombian gunmen be 
tried on charges of illegally exporting military expertise a senior 
police official said today 
the police official also confirmed frontpage reports carried by 
three major dailies saying that investigators have found no evidence 
to support suspicions that the israelis trained assassins for drug 
lords in colombia 
the six israelis have said they were training farmers to defend 
themselves against attacks by leftist guerrillas 
trying the officers would be an unusual crackdown by the defense 
establishment on israelis involved in overseas weapons deals often 
such officers are protected by their reputations as wartime heroes 
news of the army officers alleged involvement caused a public 
uproar partly out of embarrassment over allegations of their links 
with the medellin drug cartel and its assassination campaign in 
colombia 
the investigation of six israelis of the security firm hod 
hahanit or spearhead began aug 27 after an american television 
network showed a uniformed man speaking hebrew during a training 
session of supposed drug assassins 
the senior police official said the investigation should be 
completed early next week 
israeli reports said colombian police have failed to give the 
israelis any evidence of narcoticsrelated crimes the investigators 
have questioned the suspects about their involvement and questioned 
defense officials on licensing regulations their information 
indicates the suspects violated israeli law by failing to obtain a 
license before holding military training courses overseas the 
police officer said 
the charge carries a maximum punishment of seven years 
imprisonment a lesser charge could be brought following expected 
plea bargaining the police official said 
yediot ahronot newspaper identified the israelis likely to stand 
trial as three reserve officers yair klein amatzia shoali and 
avraham zadaka as well as their associates teddi melnick dror eyal 
and yitzhak shoshanimariot who mediated the deals in colombia all 
six have been questioned by police 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has said he denied the officers a 
license to train gunmen in colombia 
klein a lieutenant colonel in the reserves has argued he did 
not need a license because he was training cattle farmers not 
officials he also has denied having anything to do with drug 
dealers 
asked about rpeorts he will stand trial klein told hadashot 
daily this is a technical violation when it reaches the court 
im sure i will be acquitted 
klein commanded an infantry batallion in israels 1982 lebanon 
invasion and began his career in weapons dealing by selling arms to 
the christian phalange militia in beirut after completing active 
military duty in 1985

the school board has dropped a plan to 
give random drug tests to all high school students in 
extracurricular activities from the band to the math club and 
decided to screen only athletes 
more than 100 parents and students packed the board room tuesday 
night for the threehour debate on amending the testing policy in 
the chicago suburb some parents complained about the cost of 
widespread testing 
the homewoodflossmoor school board voted 52 to restrict the 
tests to athletes the board is expected to decide in two weeks how 
to conduct the tests 
three weeks ago the board adopted a policy that would have 
tested every high school student in extracurricular activities the 
districts high school has 2100 students 1500 were in 
interscholastic activities last year 
superintendent ed rachford had said that all students 
representing the school in afterschool activities should be subject 
to drug testing 
board member robert butler who offered the amendment restricting 
the tests said limiting the tests to athletes would face less of a 
constitutional challenge than widespread testing of many students 
a federal appeals court last year unanimously ruled that a high 
school near lafayette ind could randomly test athletes only a 
handful of high schools across the country test athletes for drugs

two cosmonauts orbited the 
earth today and prepared to climb aboard the space station mir after 
a fourmonth break in the soviet manned space program forced by 
failures and cost disputes 
commander alexander s viktorenko and engineer alexander a 
serebrov rode a trail of orange flame into a starfilled night sky 
early today aboard a rocket emblazoned with advertising 
scientists at baikonur cosmodrome applauded when their soyuz tm8 
capsule reached orbit nine minutes later and official reports said 
all was well with the crew the capsule dropped two booster rockets 
one carrying a 150foothigh ad for an italian insurance company 
the capsule is to dock friday with mir space station which was 
unmanned at the end of april because of criticism of the cost of the 
space program and because two new modules were not ready 
the government newspaper izvestia today said the new modules will 
add 60 square yards to the cramped living area in space and more 
important sharply increase the research capabilities of mir 
as a whole the crew is getting the possibility of carrying out 
on a contemporary level work in the fields of geophysics 
astrophysics technology and biology izvestia said 
officials said the new modules are nearly finished and the two 
cosmonauts will attach them in october and february before they are 
replaced in march mir already is joined with kvant an astrophysics 
laboratory 
the first new module features a shower and sink airlock for 
spacewalks and incubator in which japanese quail eggs will be 
hatched to study the effects of weightlessness on heredity the 
second has a telescopic camera for studying the stars a docking 
port for the buran shuttle and equipment to grow vegetables 
tass in another effort to boost the space program today 
reported space research has brought 19 billion in profits through 
improved weather forecasting communications navigation and 
transport rescue 
viktorenko and serebrov have a busy schedule during their 
sixmonth mission which also is an important public relations 
exercise 
soviet officials have stressed such space flights can yield 
practical dividends and pounded home the theme in the final hours 
before liftoff 
to help their space program pay more of its own way they even 
allowed advertising 
one of three stages of the 150foot booster rocket painted 
orange carried an ad for the italian company generali others for 
a soviet electronics company and new dawn perfume were 
displayed on a side of the launch pad and in a room where the 
cosmonauts met reporters monday night 
mir was unexpectedly vacated in april because two addon modules 
were not ready and the kremlin did not want to keep a crew aboard 
while legislators and ordinary people were demanding more spending 
at home 
if we had colossal sums we could have had the two modules on 
time but we have limited resources like everyone else lt gen 
vladimir a shatalov head of cosmonaut training told the 
associated press 
leaving the mir unoccupied for only the second time since its 
february 1986 launch showed a new sensitivity to public opinion by 
the soviet space bureaucracy 
gorbachevs political reforms have given space officials 
something in common with the us national aeronautics and space 
administration opposition from a skeptical public and legislators 
trying to trim a budget deficit of 192 billion 
space officials invited reporters from all 15 soviet republics 
and several western countries to watch the blastoff at the huge 
baikonur cosmodrome 1560 miles southeast of moscow in kazakhstan 
they also showed off the new space shuttle buran and its ground 
facilities 
in a scene unlikely at nasas cape canaveral journalists were 
even allowed on a flatbed railroad car that carried the 310ton 
capsule and booster assembly to the launch pad at dawn monday 
chief engineer yuri p semenov said moscow spent 2 billion on 
its civilian space program last year and the tm8 mission cost 
1388 
he estimated potential economic benefits from the flight such as 
discovering mineral deposits using mirs remote sensing equipment 
at 132 million

aids victims should not be isolated or given 
special treatment in us schools according to a new guide that 
says uptodate knowledge about the disease should quiet fears that 
the virus can be easily transmitted 
until now many people have been fearful that aids could be 
transmitted at school the national association of state boards of 
education said today in the booklet that updates guidelines issued 
by the centers for disease control in 1985 we have enough 
information to stop worrying about this 
what we do need to worry about and the place to put our 
energy and concern is into education 
the guidelines endorsed by a variety of health and education 
groups call for confidentiality but oppose mandatory testing of 
school pupils or employees for aids 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease 
that destroys the bodys ability to fight infection the disease is 
spread through the exchange of body fluids infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus popularly called hiv 
the guide said about 15 million people in the united states are 
infected with the hiv virus more than 102000 cases of aids have 
been diagnosed in this country since 1981 and more than 59000 of 
those victims have died 
the new booklet gives educators uptodate knowledge about aids 
and how the disease is spread said brenda welburn of the school 
board association previous guidelines suggested that schools be 
cautious about children who bite or who werent toilet trained in 
case the aids virus might be transmitted through saliva or handling 
diapers 
we now know that hiv is not transmitted through saliva or 
urine said welburn even the possibility that the aids virus 
would be transmitted through simple exposure to blood is extremely 
low 
so the suggested policy is to allow students who are infected to 
attend school and be entitled to all rights privileges and services 
received by other students the guide said 
no school employee shall be terminated nonrenewed demoted 
suspended transferred or subjected to adverse action based solely 
on the fact that he or she is infected with hiv it said 
those who become ill should be allowed to retain eligibility for 
all benefits that are provided for other school employees with 
longterm diseases or disabling conditions the guide said 
the main cause for concern would be if the infected person had a 
secondary infection such as tuberculosis that might pose a serious 
risk to others 
confidentiality is another key point in the new guidelines which 
were developed by a panel of 20 organizations representing law 
medicine public health and education groups 
it is now known that the aids virus is not transmitted through 
casual interactions between individuals so the guide said a school 
official who learns that someone in school has aids can handle 
the situation in a standard confidential manner 
it is not necessary to share the identity of a person who has 
the aids virus with a large number of people said welburn noting 
that decisions should be made on a casebycase basis 
mandatory testing has no place in the nations schools the 
guidelines said the suggested policy states mandatory screening 
for communicable diseases that are not spread by casual contact 
such as hiv infection shall not be a condition for school entry or 
attendance or for employment or continued employment 
the guide entitled someone at school has aids was developed 
for state and local policymakers by the association in conjunction 
with the centers for disease control based in atlanta about 15 
national organizations are recommending the book to their 
memberships 
the association of state and territorial health officials 
described the guide as clear concise and straightforward 
information while the council of chief state school officers 
predicted the booklet will be of inestimable value because it 
is both scientifically accurate and sensitive to the mission of 
schools 
jim williams of the national education association health 
information network said we revised our policy on the issue of 
confidentiality and testing of students based on the guides 
recommendation 
beverly farquhar director of the national association of school 
nurses added this has really helped our cause a great deal 
she explained that school officials who in the past had been 
reluctant now enthusiastically allow the association to conduct for 
teachers special workshops on the proper handling of bodily fluids 
the guide reinforces universal techniques she said

youngsters who look after themselves after school 
for 11 or more hours a week are twice as likely to abuse alcohol 
tobacco and marijuana as children who arent latchkey kids a 
report says 
the study of nearly 5000 eighthgraders in the los angeles and 
san diego areas found a higher risk of drug and alcohol abuse and 
smoking in twoparent as well as singleparent households and in 
affluent as well as poor ones 
the authors speculated that time spent alone promotes 
experimentation with drugs and alcohol 
the study is published in this months issue of pediatrics the 
journal of the american academy of pediatrics which is based in 
suburban elk grove village 
adolescents who abuse drugs and alcohol while caring for 
themselves may be manifesting a desire to display their sense of 
maturity and independence said the study 
the findings support recent articles that suggest some problem 
behavior among youngsters can be linked at least in part to the 
amount of time they spend without adult supervision particularly 
after school the authors said

at least 30 east germans tired of 
awaiting permission for a mass exodus to the west made a risky 
overnight dash across the hungarian border into austria the red 
cross said today 
in bonn west german officials acknowledged they were making 
little progress in changing the minds of communist east german 
leaders who intervened with hungarian authorities to block the 
departure of about 5500 refugees 
east german officials on tuesday set up camp outside a tent 
community in budapest sheltering many of the wouldbe emigres and 
began trying to persuade them to return to east germany the 
refugees hope to cross austria and enter west germany where they 
will automatically receive citizenship 
the latest escape involved more refugees than those of recent 
days when increased hungarian border patrols and prospects of an 
imminent sponsored exodus apparently deterred east germans from 
fleeing illegally to austria 
austrian red cross officials said the 30 east germans made it 
across the border where hungary began dismantling fortifications in 
may but still maintains some stretches of barbed wire and other 
barriers 
in budapest refugees gathered near a brownandwhite trailer of 
the east german embassy towed into place across the road from their 
camp 
but none approached the door in the first hour and several of 
those waiting to leave for austria and then west germany derided 
their hardline communist countrys attempts to win them back 
they must really be stupid to come here said a heavyset 
east german who was among the first to set up residence at the 
zugliget tent camp when it opened midaugust but i guess they 
have no choice its either victory or siberia for them 
its a disgrace yelled a woman in another small group no 
one is going to go in there anyway 
relief worker csilla von boeselager said camp residents have been 
asked to refrain from unwise actions against the east german 
diplomats or their trailer 
first secretary dieter grahmann of the east german embassy told 
reporters crowding their trailer that any refugees were free to 
discuss the situation with him or second secretary wolfgang 
forster 
east germany increased efforts tuesday to persuade the refugees 
to return home with grahmann handing out leaflets promising no 
penalties for those who give up their quest to go west 
he retreated after being mobbed by a hostile crowd 
west german government spokesman hans klein told reporters in 
bonn today there is no indication that east germany is prepared 
to change its position he would not say when the refugees might 
be allowed to leave 
however foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said the west 
german government remains confident a solution can be found soon 
the hungarian government knows how urgent a solution is he 
said we are convinced that a humanitarian solution will follow 
soon 
several refugees told reporters today that they are resigned to 
long stays in hungary after officials deflated hopes that their 
departure for west germany was imminent 
theyre going to let us out anyway theres no reason for 
desperation said one refugee ive waited to leave for the west 
for seven years at home another few months wont matter 
with legal travel difficult to the west but relatively easy to 
hungary a liberal soviet bloc country east germans began fleeing 
from hungary to austria in droves after hungary removed some wire 
barriers and observation posts from its 120mile western border 
hungary has defied a bilateral agreement with east germany and 
refused to send back east germans trying to flee their homeland 
west german politicians said last week the hungarian leadership 
also has promised to let wouldbe emigres go to west germany which 
grants them automatic citizenship and generous social benefits 
expectations were heightened last week when west german 
authorities built five tent cities to house the east germans in 
bavaria but senior hungarian officials cautioned monday and tuesday 
that departure could be weeks away because hungary still is seeking 
grudging east german agreement 
peter dickscheidt of the west german maltesian aid organization 
said about 5500 wouldbe emigres were registered by early today at 
the four budapest camps and a fifth on balaton lake 90 miles 
southwest of the capital

strike capping nationwide protests of the parliamentary election 
factories businesses schools and transportation services closed 
down in major cities where more than 90 percent of black workers 
and most students stayed home 
police said they used tear gas rubber bullets and birdshot to 
halt protests at election booths and to stop crowds from throwing 
stones and erecting barricades in black indian and mixedrace 
townships at least 15 people were arrested including journalists 
in a mixedrace suburb east of johannesburg police escorted 
television crews away from a demonstration before using tear gas and 
whips to disperse protesters witnesses said many demonstrators were 
children police arrested two men 
police also arrested 13 antielection protesters at a voting 
station in durban 
the congress of south african trade unions said more than 1 
million blacks participated in tuesdays demonstrations rallies and 
strikes at which police arrested 500 people 
train service into cape town was delayed today by an early 
morning explosion on the track the south african transport service 
said no injuries were reported 
acting president fw de klerk smiled shook hands and enjoyed a 
champagne breakfast at his pretoriaarea polling booth officials 
say the vote is the most crucial since the governing national party 
came to power on promises of strict race segregation in 1948 
de klerks nationalists are expected to lose up to 30 of their 
123 parliamentary seats mostly to the conservative party which 
favors strict race discrimination 
nevertheless the nationalists are expected to retain a majority 
in parliaments dominant white chamber after promoting a plan to 
begin sharing some power with the countrys 28 million blacks 
the government said 3170667 whites were eligible to vote 
turnout was reported sluggish because of freezing temperatures and 
biting winds early today but lines formed at polling places after 
noon government radio said 
whites voted for members of the white house of assembly more 
than 665000 indians and 17 million people of mixed race were 
eligible to vote for separate parliament chambers with little power 
blacks have no vote 
the polls opened at 7 am and were to close at 9 pm final 
election results are not expected until thursday 
police armed with handguns were stationed at most polling booths 
major black townships around durban cape town pretoria 
johannesburg and eastern cape cities were quiet 
virtually no taxivans were operating and buses and trains to 
the cities were 70 percent to 100 percent empty 
black worker absenteeism ranged from 72 percent in the industrial 
heartland around johannesburg to virtually 100 percent in the 
eastern cape cities of port elizabeth and uitenhage said the labor 
monitoring group at the university of the witwatersrand 
the stayaway is very comprehensive with most companies 
reporting absenteeism of over 70 percent said brian angus 
director of the steel and engineering industries federation whose 
members employ 350000 mostly black workers 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu said im not paying a great 
deal of attention to the elections im more interested in how 
many people stay away i would hope that white south africans would 
be aware that the bulk of the people in this country are not voting 
and they should join us in getting rid of the system 
state television said low voter turnout would increase the 
chances of a hung parliament in which no party would have a 
majority in that case a coalition government would have to be 
formed or a new election called 
for the first time since 1953 political analysts predict the 
nationalists could receive less than half the white vote but as 
long as they poll more than 40 percent and retain 84 of their 123 
seats they will remain the governing party 
the rightwing conservative party has 22 of the white chambers 
166 elected seats the antiapartheid democrats have 20 and one seat 
in the last parliament was held by a nowdefunct moderate party 
the governmentrun radio south africa said the elections have a 
vital bearing on how south africa enters the future and how this 
country will look in succeeding decades 
the nationalistts have proposed negotiating a new constitution 
giving blacks a share of national power within five years but also 
protecting against a loss of white power 
the conservatives say negotiating with blacks inevitably will 
lead to black majority rule

vicksburg miss evening post on colombia 
the legitimate government of colombia in bogota has at last 
declared war on the shadow government of drug lords and thugs who 
have been calling the shots from their own capital city of medellin 
the bad guys have been bullying and bribing government 
authorities for years murder is the favorite tool of intimidation 
about 220 colombian judges have been gunned down in the past eight 
years 
the medellin kingpins who are believed to traffic most of the 
cocaine entering the united states reportedly are most afraid of 
being prosecuted in the us justice system 
small wonder the traffickers can always replace the guns and 
livestock the government confiscates but prosecution and conviction 
in the united states would be a real blow that could take them out 
of action for years 
president bush deserves credit for quickly offering us 
assistance to colombian president virgilio barco vargas he doesnt 
advise sending us troops to colombia to fight nor do we 
but an effective extradition program could certainly let drug 
terrorists know that they will find no safe harbor from us law in 
colombia 
at the same time us officials must reassure the colombian 
government that we are doing something to shrink the american 
cocaine market that is fueling their civil war

the herald everett wash on war and peace 
the european phase of world war ii began 50 years ago making it 
a halfcentury since the start of the most ghastly conflict mankind 
has ever seen the war brought unparalleled destruction and 
suffering and left a legacy of atomic terror under which humanity 
still lives 
both in europe and the pacific the war stemmed from unchecked 
aggression selfdelusion and virulent racist nationalism a 
halfcentury later many complex explanations can be brought to bear 
to help clarify the course of events but the fact of unrestrained 
selfindulgences amounting to a monstrous evil continues to lie 
at the heart of any sensible understanding of the roots of the war 
yet in the face of organized evil an entire generation of free 
men and women stood up the fight was harrowing and costly but it 
was necessary and successful 
one of the highest measures of the success stands in the general 
peace that has prevailed since the end of the war this peace stands 
as a reminder that people of dedication and good will can prevail in 
times of continued international tensions as well as in war

los angeles herald examiner on the outlook for unions 
labor unions represent only 17 percent of todays american work 
force down from 26 percent at its 1953 peak 
there are few better examples of the dwindling clout of organized 
labor than the united auto workers humiliating defeat at nissans 
smyrna tenn plant despite fervent union organizing relatively 
wellpaid workers rejected the uaw by a 2to1 margin 
from atlanta to houston other cities have experienced a miniboom 
in businesses with industries relocating south of the masondixon 
to take advantage of the general antiunion righttowork ethos 
there 
is the us destined to follow the lead of japan where 
unions are basically a compliant arm of management not likely 
traditions even in america are hard to kill 
unions will have to focus on what the new generation of workers 
is increasingly demanding rather than bargaining for raises 
union negotiators will be asking for parental leave flexible work 
schedules and more employer help in caring for children and aged 
parents and with medical costs rising the basic family 
benefit of health and hospitalization insurance already is a 
controversial labor issue 
unions had better take an increasing interest in family 
issues or risk being left out of employeremployee negotiations

the flint mich journal on credit cards for children 
our deficitladen nation is trying to dig itself out of a 
worrisome financial mess caused by a reckless creditcard mentality 
all around us are people who are up to the eyebrows in debt from 
saying charge it too often economists are saying our countrys 
fiscal problems arent going to improve unless consumers start 
saving more 
so what does denvers young americans bank which caters to 
youths decide to do issue a kidsonly mastercard card holders 
must be at least 12 and have a parent cosign the card carries a 
15 membership fee and 188 percent interest on unpaid balances 
youngsters cant go on wild spending sprees with their new plastic 
the cards have a 100 credit limit 
what it does not limit is reinforcement of the principle of 
instant gratification thats not something most children and 
government officials come to think of it have a problem 
understanding what they really need are lessons in the value of 
working hard saving and paying as you go

the phoenix gazette on education 
if american university president richard berendzens view of the 
future is accurate we are at a zenith in educational attainment 
hows that for a scary thought 
at his annual backtoschool breakfast with reporters at the 
national press club in washington dc recently berendzen 
predicted declining college achievement standards for the 1990s and 
beyond 
he relates plunging standards to demographic trends and fierce 
competition for high school graduates starting in 1993 the number 
of 18yearolds will rise but 80 percent of the increase will be 
students who are black hispanic or asian he said 
according to berendzen the real growth industry will be in the 
community colleges most of which will be providing remedial 
education 
unfortunately educators repeated recitations of the link 
between ethnicity income and poor achievement doesnt contribute 
anything that isnt already known 
john h bunzel president of san jose state university writing 
in the the wall street journal suggests that schools stop focusing 
on what is outside of their control and instead concentrate on 
what should be their primary mission strong instructional 
leadership that will foster the academic preparation and performance 
of students 
unless public education is restructured to permit all parents 
not just wealthy ones to choose schools that fit that description 
berendzens dismal prediction is almost certain to come true

kennebec journal augusta maine on ambassadorial appointments 
should president bush have named as ambassador to spain a florida 
real estate developer who donated at least 100000 to bushs 
presidential campaign but doesnt know beans about spain 
more than any recent president bush has rewarded wealthy 
campaign donors with lengthy stays abroad of the 44 ambassadorships 
he has filled so far only 14 went to career diplomats rather than 
political appointees less than a third 
by contrast even ronald reagan profoundly suspicious of federal 
bureaucrats and the state department in particular appointed about 
65 percent from career civil servants 
not that ambassadors chosen from other fields dont sometimes do 
a fine job they do but ability is important theres a big 
difference between an oil baron whod like to live abroad and david 
bruce or mike mansfield to name two superb diplomats who came from 
outside the state department

the philadelphia inquirer on president bushs ambassadors 
president bush has doled out ambassadorships to so many cronies 
that its hard to single out someone as the least qualified former 
sen chic hecht who once argued that nevada shouldnt get a 
nuclear waste suppository liked being sent to the bahamas 
because of the golf links there 
then theres peter f secchia a building supply executive and 
gop stalwart who kicked off his tour of duty as ambassador in rome 
with a little joke the new italian navy he said has 
glassbottomed boats so it can see the old italian navy 
still the most embarrassing nomination may be that of developer 
joseph zappala who gave the gop more than 100000 to be the main 
man in spain a foreign affairs neophyte he knows little about 
spain mr zappala cant even speak spanish 
yet unless the senate says no he might still be in the job in 
1992 when spain and the united states will honor the 500th 
anniversary of christopher columbus voyage to the new world thats 
when this envoy could turn to a translator or a phrase book to 
toast usspanish relations

burlington county times willingboro nj on cost of the us 
capitol police 
the us capitol police whose sole mission is to protect house 
and senate members and their staffs will cost almost 60 million 
next year 
one wasteful feature is that the house and senate branches of the 
police force are administratively separate with different pay 
scales but efforts to unify the two forces have been frustrated by 
a clash between the house and senate sergeantsatarms neither 
wants to relinquish control over personnel 
this is one problem congress cannot blame on the white house and 
it naturally raises a question if they cannot handle a management 
challenge of the sort that every mayor or city council takes for 
granted why should we trust their judgmemt on harder issues

philadelphia daily news on baby boomers and the rolling stones 
rolling stones mick jagger and keith richards probably have 
gathered a bit of moss and jerry garcias grateful dead ought to be 
grateful that is 
but they are the hottest tickets in the oddly nostalgic world of 
rock and roll when word got around about a return tour for the who 
we asked where when 
why 
for the same reason sports fans step over todays leading golfers 
to join arnies army or to follow jack nicklaus for the same reason 
they stay away from the fights until ray leonard or roberto duran 
laces up the gloves 
because the baby boomers who outnumber any other living 
generation make the decisions about whats worth paying for 
and those who used to distrust anybody over 30 now cast a 
jaundiced eye toward anyone who doesnt have at least an occasional 
use for liniment

the sun bremerton wash on the soviet economy 
in the latest of several developments that threaten perestroika 
the moscow city government has decided to bar nonresidents from 
buying items such as clothing from the soviet capitals stores due 
to scarcities 
that is far more serious than it might seem relatively speaking 
moscow has long been an oasis in the desert of soviet consumer 
goods every week hundreds of thousands of shoppers from elsewhere 
have flocked there in search of meat refrigerators and other 
merchandise they cannot find in their hometown stores 
in effect the soviets are moving toward internal protectionism 
this protectionism mirrors a new trend among other warsaw pact 
countries which are making it harder for each others tourists to 
take scarce goods home czechoslovakia and east germany for 
example recently outlawed foreign purchases of food and toilet 
paper the soviets responded with their own ban on exports of 
refrigerators and caviar 
whatever its immediate advantages for particular groups in the 
long run such protectionism will inevitably make the eastern blocs 
economic woes even worse thoughtful soviets realize this the 
government newspaper izvestia strongly denounced moscows new 
shopping rules 
gorbachevs entire reform agenda is in danger unless he can turn 
the economy around the only way to do that is to move far more 
boldly toward a free market not further away

bangor maine daily news on the polish economy 
poland ironically is back where it was a halfcentury ago 
the object of bargaining between east and west the new poland 
cannot survive on the meager financial aid package offered by 
president george bush but the united states and europe which must 
be ready to make a substantial infusion of funds into the polish 
economy cannot do so now out of selfinterest it must be clear 
that public opinion will acknowledge solidarity as the victor if the 
new polish government slays its economic monster the credit cannot 
go to the discredited and politically bankrupt communists in the 
coalition 
like their countrymen in the lines outside the bakeries the 
polish people will have to wait it is difficult to ask for further 
patience from people who have suffered and sacrificed for three 
generations but this time there is genuine reason for hope and gain 
in the crumbling of the soviet empire

the milwaukee journal on fawn hall 
if the student association at marquette university wanted to 
squander 3500 to hear fawn hall last thursday give her 
unenlightened version of the irancontra scandal thats their 
business but we have to wonder why undergraduates whose fees 
support the associated students organization didnt rise up in 
protest or were they just momentarily blinded by halls star status 
and why did the student group roll over and play dead to the 
demand by hall herself a media creation that the news media be 
kept out of the event the ban a part of halls standard contract 
for all speaking engagements didnt work very well at marquette 
anyway print journalists got in easily and even a television 
reporter managed to hurl a loaded question at the 
secretaryturnedcelebrity before he was thrown out cynics might 
think that the press restrictions were part of a clever plot by 
halls handlers to generate still more news coverage of her 
appearances 
the real marvel is that there was an audience for the woman who 
typed filed and shredded for lt col oliver north the convicted 
contragater she shed absolutely no light on the armsforhostages 
debacle she offered her same tired defenses of norths illegal 
actions and she showed a continuing contempt for the role of 
congress in setting foreign policy 
clearly fawn halls audiences dont come to hear a reasoned 
analysis of national security issues they come because 1 she is 
blond leggy and attractive and 2 notoriety sells when halls 15 
minutes of fame have expired what will she and her fans do for an 
encore

the justice department today opened a criminal 
investigation of allegations that law enforcement officers committed 
civil rights violations while quelling a weekend riot at virginia 
beach va 
a department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said the fbi had 
received two complaints from civilians who were in virginia beach 
the scene of rioting among a crowd of 100000 youths over the labor 
day weekend 
police and national guard troops used clubs to disperse the 
crowds which largely consisted of students from predominantly black 
east coast colleges 
burstionwade said the fbi and the departments civil rights 
division had formally opened a criminal investigation into possible 
deprivation of civil rights 
the spokeswoman said she couldnt provide specific information 
about the two complaints against law enforcement officers that were 
filed today with the fbi 
the justice department was continuing to review published 
accounts and videotapes of police and national guard troops clashing 
with the rioters she said 
virginia beachs mayor said earlier that she welcomed a federal 
investigation into how the city handled the disturbances 
i have nothing to fear in this city being open to scrutiny 
mayor meyera e oberndorf said tuesday we want the opportunity to 
have our name cleared 
other city officials joined the mayor in supporting the police 
according to perliminary counts 1235 people were charged with 
1346 offenses most of the charges involved disorderly conduct 
traffic offenses and public drinking 
the rioters early sunday and sunday night were mostly black 
college students attending the annual endofsummer greekfest at 
least 43 people were injured including 30 police officers or 
national guardsmen 
these statistics do not even begin to tell the story when 
youre in the middle of a riot you dont have time to make arrests 
your main concern is to get the streets secured said police chief 
charles r wall 
these officers were exposed to an extreme situation city 
manager aubrey v watts jr said its incredible that they were 
able to restore law and order without firing a single shot or using 
fatal force 
watts said a city team will evaluate the millions of dollars in 
damage much of it attributed to looting caused by a crowd of about 
100000 young people who attended the annual event known as 
greekfest he also said he will gather reports from police fire and 
emergency personnel 
sen john w warner rva said he has alerted the us small 
business administration to be ready to process requests for disaster 
aid from more than 100 businesses damaged 
merchants and innkeepers said they would meet to discuss how to 
avoid similar problems at next years greekfest 
you cant do a whole lot said rick kowalewitch owner of 
rks windsurf shop on 17th street no matter what we do we look 
like a racist 
many of the young people who were chased off the streets by 
police were black but kowalewitch said he and other whites were 
ordered around by police as well 
greekfest participants were divided about whether they would 
return 
brad williams 23 of white plains ny said he has enjoyed the 
gathering for five years and will come back 
muriel steptoe 26 and alicia dailey 25 of springfield mass 
said they would not return because of the disturbance this year 
if anybody comes back next year i think it will be the ones who 
want to make trouble ms steptoe said

womens blood cholesterol levels worsen abruptly 
after menopause and this may help explain their increasing risk of 
heart attacks according to a study 
while heart disease is rare in women before menopause their risk 
increases tenfold after age 55 
in a study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine doctors watched changes in two main components of 
cholesterol high density lipoprotein or hdl and low density 
lipoprotein or ldl as women underwent menopause hdl protects 
against heart disease while ldl increases the risk 
the researchers found that womens hdl levels dropped 4 
milligrams per deciliter of blood when they went through menopause 
while their ldl rose 12 milligrams 
the findings support the idea that menopause does lead to 
increased risk of coronary artery disease in women because of the 
negative changes in lipids said dr karen a matthews a 
researcher at the university of pittsburgh who directed the study 
when menopausal women took estrogen supplements there was little 
change in their blood cholesterol levels the study found 
matthews said more research is needed before researchers 
recommend routine use of estrogen to protect against heart disease 
estrogen supplements after menopause have been linked with an 
increase risk of some forms of cancer 
as women enter the period when they are likely to undergo 
menopause which is around 50 its an ideal time for them to have 
their cholesterol levels regularly checked matthews said if 
they begin to experience declines in hdl or increases in ldl it 
would be very useful to alter dietary factors and exercise to have a 
more healthpromoting lifestyle 
the study began with 541 women ages 42 to 50 who had not 
undergone menopause over the next 2 years 101 of them stopped 
menstruating and 32 of these women began taking estrogen 
supplements 
their hdl and ldl levels were compared with those of women the 
same age who had not reached menopause

hurricane gabrielle churned toward bermuda and the 
east coast with winds of 135 mph today raising 10foot swells up to 
1300 miles away on north carolinas outer banks 
gabrielles 500mile wide spiral bypassed the caribbean and was 
expected to reach bermuda by friday or saturday the island got 
15foot swells today 
already the atlantic seasons biggest hurricane it was upgraded 
tuesday evening to a category 4 hurricane with 5 the strongest 
an air force reconnaissance plane flew over gabrielle late 
tuesday and reported rising barometric pressure and a slightly 
expanding eye in the hurricane signs that strengthening could be 
unlikely forecasters said 
but early today gabrielles pressure decreased slightly and its 
eye constricted again 
as of noon gabrielle was centered near 24 north latitude and 59 
west longitude 610 miles southsoutheast of bermuda it was moving 
northnorthwest at 12 mph and was expected to take a more northerly 
course in the next 24 hours 
early today a buoy on the outer banks recorded 10foot swells 
from the distant hurricane said hurricane specialist jim gross 
while it was uncertain how close gabrielle would come to bermuda 
its considerable size prompted forecasters to advise residents of 
the island and the east coast to monitor it closely 
forecasters said the storm rivaled last years recordsetting 
hurricane gilbert at the same stage but was on a path more like 
1985s powerful hurricane gloria which did 900 million in damage 
as it raced up the east coast 
gilberts winds reached more than 155 mph and had the lowest 
central pressure measured this century at 888 millibars central 
pressure governs wind intensity gilbert was ranked category 5 
gabrielles pressure increased from 942 millibars to 945 millibars 
late tuesday 
while gilbert stayed on a westerly course across the upper 
caribbean devastating jamaica and landing in mexico gabrielle 
dodged past the caribbean and headed up into the atlantic 
gloria roared up the atlantic in the fall of 1985 at an unusually 
fast 30 to 50 mph panicking thousands of east coast residents but 
its winds dropped from 150 mph to minimal hurricane strength by the 
time it reached land 
in barbados the easternmost caribbean island 550 miles southeast 
of puerto rico gabrielles tail caused 10foot waves and some 
flooding in beachfront homes and businesses in the capital of 
bridgetown no injuries or serious damage were reported 
far to the north meanwhile hurricane felixs winds were 85 mph 
little strengthening was expected for felix which posed no 
threat to land at noon its center was near 37 north latitude and 
48 west longitude or 910 miles west of the azores it was drifting 
to the northnortheast

us ambassador john mccarthy and his 
staff were evacuated today from lebanon after hundreds of christians 
besieged the embassy in a protest to demand action against syria 
it was the first time washington has pulled its ambassador out of 
lebanon despite 14 years of civil war 
the 30 diplomats left because deteriorating local circumstances 
no longer permitted the embassy to function effectively said 
keith peterson a spokesman for the us embassy in nicosia 
the sudden decision to pull out of lebanon where christian 
forces and syrian troops have been battling for six months came 
after hundreds of angry christians surrounded the embassy compound 
tuesday 
the protesters at the embassy in the beirut suburb of aoukar 
dispersed several hours after mccarthys departure today but they 
said in a statement they would besiege the compound again if the 
ambassador returns 
the christian army leader gen michel aoun said in a statement 
released by his office it seems the american cain couldnt endure 
the stare of the lebanese abel so he left aoun has repeatedly 
criticized the united states for failing to help the christians in 
their battle with the syrians 
the withdrawal of american diplomats represents the latest 
setback for us policy in lebanon on april 18 1983 a bomb at the 
us embassy killed at least 49 people while the united states was 
involved in talks to arrange a withdrawal of foreign forces from 
lebanon 
on oct 23 1983 suicide bombers rammed trucks packed with 
explosives into marine and french peacekeeper posts killing 241 
americans and 58 french in february 1984 the us marines force 
was withdrawn from lebanon 
in addition eight of 16 western hostages held by proiranian 
extremists in lebanon are american the longestheld is terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
in todays embassy evacuation the ambassador and 29 american 
staff were flown by helicopter to a british sovereign base in cyprus 
three hours later they took off aboard a military aircraft for 
italy informed sources said the sources who insisted on not being 
identified further said the dc9 aircraft departed at noon 5 am 
edt from the akrotiri base in southern cyprus bound for a nato 
military base in sigonella sicily 
in washington however state department spokesman mark dillen 
said the diplomats would travel to a us base in west germany later 
today officials said they would then head back to the united states 
in a day or two 
dillen added the evacuation does not represent a diminution of 
our intention to try to help lebanon he said the united states 
would work with arab states european allies the soviet union and 
countries of the region on achieving a ceasefire an end to 
blockades of lebanese ports and political reconciliation in lebanon 
the us embassy is in the countrys christian enclave where 
about 1 million christians have been trapped for six months ringed 
by the hostile syrians and their allies and angry that the west has 
not come to their rescue 
one source said the helicopters airlifted mccarthy and the 
diplomats from the embassy compound not from any of the regular 
lebanese army air bases in the christian heartland 
a diplomatic source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the british embassy in beirut was informed of the decision to 
evacuate the american embassy staff tuesday night 
the foreign office in london said its diplomats had no immediate 
plans to follow suit about 15 british embassy staff are in beirut 
a lebanese army spokesman who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the americans had notified aoun of their intention 
to leave 
the christians besieging the embassy compound were angry at the 
united states for not coming to their aid against the syrian army 
and its moslem allies since hostilities began march 8 fighting 
between the factions has since claimed the lives of 827 people and 
wounded 2452 
the crowd went into a frenzy tuesday shouting mccarthy go 
home and waving placards and posters denouncing america 
christian sources said the embassy siege was designed by aoun to 
whip up antiamerican sentiment among christians inside and outside 
lebanon to bring pressure on the united states 
the demonstrators had demanded that mccarthy submit his 
credentials to the legitimate lebanese authorities represented by 
general aoun and official us recognition of aouns authority 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem is competing 
for legitimacy with aouns threemember christian cabinet 
mccarthy took up his post in september 1988 after the emergence 
of the dual government and has not submitted his credentials to 
either cabinet he has publicly criticized syria for not responding 
to a us request to negotiate with aoun but aoun has charged that 
washington is not pushing syria hard enough 
the christian enclave has taken a fearful pounding from syrian 
artillery since march when aoun launched his selfproclaimed war 
of liberation to force the syrians to withdraw their 40000 troops 
in lebanon 
even though his forces are outnumbered and outgunned his 
objective appeared to be to mobilize us and european support for 
the christians 
that startegy has failed washington has made sympathetic noises 
but has made it clear it has no intention of getting drawn into the 
lebanese quagmire again

the most populous city in south 
africa was quiet on election day 
as the morning sun burned off the coalsmoke haze covering 
soweto the township of 25 million blacks substituted its usual 
weekday bustle for a day of silent protest wednesday 
the huge taxi depot near baragwanath hospital where thousands 
catch minibus taxis into johannesburg each day was nearly empty a 
wind sent swirls of dust across a deserted parking lot that normally 
overflows with commuters 
im not going to work for political reasons said martin 
mika a salesman for the south african breweries 
mika joined hundreds of thousands of blacks in a general strike 
tuesday and wednesday to protest the segregated parliamentary 
elections that exclude the black majority 
no formal protest rallies were planned but soweto schools 
frequently the site of militant protest were closed as were most 
stores the sowetan newspaper the countrys largest blackoriented 
daily did not publish 
taxi driver fred sadike estimated that only 20 percent of the 
taxis the primary means of transportation for most urban blacks 
were operating wednesday most were traveling only inside the 
township not going to johannesburg he said 
sadike said he believed the election promise made by acting 
president fw de klerk who pledged to bring blacks into the 
national government on a limited basis within five years

a cuban airliner that crashed on takeoff and 
killed 170 people was buffeted by powerful winds from a thunderstorm 
just before it plunged into a havana suburb cuban news reports said 
today 
of 126 people aboard the chartered cubana de aviacion plane only 
one survived the plane carried mostly italians returning from 
vacation 
fortyfive people were killed on the ground in the suburb of 
boyeros a half mile from the airport according to the cuban 
official news agency prensa latina monitored in mexico city earlier 
reports said 25 died on the ground 
dozens of people were injured many critically 
the sovietmade ilyushin 62 crashed moments after takeoff from 
havana in a thunderstorm sunday night destroying two square blocks 
of homes in boyeros 
in a preliminary report a cuban government commission said that 
at the time of the disaster there was an abrupt worsening of the 
meteorological conditions which produced strong upward and downward 
wind currents at low altitudes near the end of the runway prensa 
latina said 
it quoted gen rogelio acevedo head of the commission and 
president of civil aeronautics institute as saying the information 
came from two flight data recorders recovered from the plane 
carlo civiletti the italian ambassador to cuba said 
investigators were trying to determine whether the crash was due to 
windshear reports in rome said it was not clear if the cuban news 
reports were talking about drafts that would be defined as windshear 
windshear develops beneath thunderstorms scientists say it is a 
downward flow of air that hits the earth and fans out in all 
directions such winds are known to have caused airliner crashes in 
dallas and new orleans 
however civiletti said in an interview published today in the 
rome newspaper republica that cuban authorities had said the cause 
of the crash was due to both pilot error and poor weather 
cuban investigators expect to report their conclusions in 15 to 
20 days

president bush embarking on a campaign to sell 
his 79 billion drug program today visited a public hospital to 
view babies abandoned by addicted mothers and defended his plan 
against carping from democrats 
my response is theyre wrong bush said of the democrats 
complaints that the plan doesnt go far enough and is inadequately 
funded 
its a good plan if people would stop just criticizing for 
partisan reasons and get behind the program and then if theres 
something additional we should do then lets do it he said 
despite bushs opposition to higher taxes democrats said he will 
have to resort to that rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the house ways and means committee said unless the president 
supports the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war 
the drug dealers are going to win 
at a news conference with journalists specializing in drug and 
crime issues the president argued that his program is 2 billion 
more than the amount being considered by the house theyre 
carping he said of his critics dismissing their objections as 
those partisan comments 
in particular he singled out rep charles rangel dny 
chairman of the house select committee on narcotics who emerged 
from a white house briefing on drugs tuesday and declared that bush 
would have to raise taxes the president said he couldnt wait to 
get out on the lawn of the white house and say raise taxes 
on capitol hill house speaker thomas s foley dwash said 
i dont think the history of this issue has been a partisan 
issue he noted that antidrug bills passed with bipartisan 
support in 1986 and 1988 but he quickly recalled the 
administration frustrated earlier efforts by democrats to 
immediately increase antidrug spending 
bushs program calls for tougher penalties on drug users and more 
money for law enforcement prisons drug treatment and education 
nobody is criticizing the strategy no one is coming at us and 
saying youve left this out or left that out the countrys 
fed up he said they dont want it to be a republican answer or 
a democratic answer or a liberal or a conservative answer 
i havent heard any real substantive attack on the strategy 
itself 
bush was noncommittal when asked about the possibility of 
establishing an international military strike force to combat drug 
lords as proposed by sen joseph biden ddel however bush said 
there was a lot of interest in such an idea and noted that he 
had made such a proposal himself during his presidential campaign 
last year 
bush also said he was openminded about the possibility of 
sending american troops to colombia if asked to help battle the 
countrys drug barons however he said colombian president virgilio 
barco has made clear he doesnt want american troops and that the 
deployment of us forces might anger the population there 
on the other hand bush said if troops were requested wed 
take a very different look at this 
the president met with reporters after paying a visit to dc 
general hospital where he stopped by a ward of babies abandoned by 
their crack and cocaineusing mothers 
the president wearing a blue smock quieted one 4monthold 
baby boy by cradling him against his shoulder the infant one of 13 
boarder babies at the hospital beamed at bush and his health 
secretary dr louis sullivan 
in his first primetime speech to the nation tuesday night bush 
held up a bag of crack cocaine seized across the street from the 
white house and declared drugs the gravest domestic threat facing 
our nation 
but he said we can pay for this fight without raising 
taxes or adding to the budget deficit instead diverting money 
from other federal programs 
bush during his hospital tour said this isnt any time for 
partisanship weve got a good program weve got lots to learn 
all of us but lets try this 
asked if he would take full responsibility for the drug war bush 
replied ill take all the responsibility in the world you see 
these kids and you want to try harder 
twenty percent of the 2000 babies born at the big municipal 
hospital here show signs of drug use by their pregnant mothers most 
of the boarder babies were abandoned by drugaddicted mothers 
shortly after birth hospital staff said they may stay as long as 
nine months awaiting a foster home even though they no longer 
require hospital care 
biden chairman of the senate judiciary committee said on abcs 
good morning america that bushs battle plan is a very very 
positive start hes going to get everything he asked for 
but biden said the question is whether or not were going to 
take it a step further and really take hold of the problem or were 
just going to try to do only what the president is suggesting 
sen john kerry dmass chairman of the senate foreign 
relations narcotics subcommittee was more critical saying on cbs 
this morning that there simply isnt the kind of bold overall 
sweeping initiative to win the war on drugs 
the proposals overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice 
system its underfunding of treatment and prevention programs and 
its utter disregard for the everworsening conditions in our 
nations inner cities dooms it to certain failure the american 
civil liberties union said of bushs antidrug strategy 
bush called for expanded treatment and education programs but he 
also urged the country to demonstrate zero tolerance for casual 
drug use and repeated his support for harsh penalties on users as 
well as dealers 
still it would be left to the states to carry out most of bushs 
recommendations targeting casual drug users such as stiffer fines 
auto seizures drivers license suspensions and publication of 
offenders names in newspapers 
the president said it promises to be a very difficult fight 
that will require an assault on every front at home as well as 
abroad 
the war on drugs will be hardwon neighborhood by 
neighborhood block by block child by child he said 
key elements of bushs plan 
authorization of 16 billion for corrections a 118 percent 
increase over 1989 to help expand the federal prison system by 77 
percent 
doubling the number of drug treatment slots to about 700000 
nationwide with the help of 925 million a 53 percent increase 
authorization for 12 billion for prevention and education a 
25 percent increase 250 million to beef up the court system a 20 
percent increase and 31 billion for law enforcement a 12 percent 
increase 
a more than twofold funding increase for local law enforcement 
efforts from 150 million to 350 million to finance a 
streetlevel attack on drugs some of the money could be used to 
develop plans for new jails and prisons 
a requirement that states impose drug tests on arrestees 
prisoners parolees and those out on bail states that did not 
comply could lose criminal justice grants 
similar threats to cut federal funding for schools colleges and 
universities that do not adopt drug prevention programs 
a call for insurance companies to cover drug treatment that 
stopped short of proposing mandatory standards 
bush also promised stronger efforts to attack drugs at their 
source in south america and elsewhere 
when requested we will for the first time make available the 
appropriate resources of americas armed forces to nations 
fighting drug production he said

extra police patrols of druginfested 
neighborhoods in the district of columbia have been suspended 
indefinitely out of concern that officers are being overworked 
police officials said wednesday 
police chief isaac fulwood told police officers earlier this week 
the overtime patrols would be stopped because of the physical and 
mental toll the program is taking on the departments street patrol 
officers 
the announcement came the day after president bush in his 
nationally televised address cited drugselling that has reached 
the park across the street from the white house in detailing his 
79 billion antidrug strategy 
the extra foot patrols begun during the summer were a response to 
the citys record murder rate believed to be fueled by drugs 
its a burnout factor that the chief had to take into account 
for the wellbeing of his men said police spokesman sgt joe 
gentile right now we dont have any idea if or when it will be 
reinstated 
the city hopes to hire 700 more police officers with 127 million 
in federal money but approval is still tied up in congress 
gentine said the extra patrols have been particularly taxing 
because they followed almost three years of other extraduty 
programs 
first you had operation clean sweep an antidrug program begun 
in 1987 and more recently there was the redeployment of officers 
to bad neighborhoods and the sixday work week gentile said 
there was a cumulative effect especially since so many guys had 
to make extra court appearances 
all of those programs especially the mandatory sixday work week 
and operation clean sweep relied heavily on overtime 
in the recent plan officers worked extra fourhour shifts three 
days a week for the past month before that officers volunteered to 
work overtime on their days off or following their regular shifts 
fulwood has submitted a plan to mayor marion barry to require all 
officers to work 60 hours per week barry has not acted on the idea 
which police officials estimate will cost about 1 million per week 
in overtime

marion f allens agonizing secret stayed 
buried for 37 years 
finally when she began expecting to hear voices from a corner of 
her back yard she called police and convinced a skeptical detective 
with 44 years on the job that there indeed was a baby buried there 
capt albert prezio has seen and heard many strange things he 
said among them people who claimed to have heard voices behind 
their walls or in their water pipes allen 68 claimed she had 
killed her baby and buried it between the garage and the backalley 
fence soon after giving birth to the illegitimate child in 1952 
and this particular woman had been under psychiatric care for 
several years family members told police but there was something 
about allen that made prezio listen 
she was pleading for help prezio said she was so sincere 
we took the chance she was telling the truth 
after failing to reach any of her doctors saturday to confirm 
whether or not allens claims were a recurring hallucination prezio 
decided to dig 
police unearthed a metal box containing the skeletal remains of a 
baby the body had been wrapped in plastic similar to the sheets dry 
cleaners use to protect clothing and the box was wrapped in more 
plastic material guaranteeing no odor would attract neighbors or 
dogs 
but the presence of the body just 40 feet from her back door 
preyed on the womans mind prezio said through 37 years she told 
no one of the birth and then allegedly smothering the baby and 
placing the body in a container the size of a fishing tackle box 
the baby allen told police was the result of an extramarital 
affair with a man who died seven or eight years ago prezio said 
police did not release the mans name 
an autopsy performed tuesday provided authorities with no 
conclusive evidence of the babys sex or how it died allen said it 
was a boy prezio said 
allen charged with seconddegree murder was ordered to undergo 
a psychiatric evaluation and faces a court hearing thursday 
allen kept her pregnancy from her husband george and son 
george jr prezio said by wearing baggy clothing she gave up 
sunbathing a favorite pastime to keep her secret 
her husband is totally clear prezio said we believe his 
story that he was completely ignorant he said he never noticed any 
change in his wifes physical appearance neither could their son i 
believe both of them 
the allens quiet treelined neighborhood a section of north 
troy called lansingburgh is made up of one and twostory 
singlefamily houses its a workingclass neighborhood in a 
bluecollar city where most of the allens neighbors like the 
allens arent talking to reporters 
prezio speculates that allen confessed because of what she 
faced by just looking out her dining area window 
she said she expected to hear voices from that corner prezio 
said she worked herself into serious mental problems 
police dug several holes without finding anything before allen 
asked prezio if she could come out and show them the exact spot 
she wasnt four inches off prezio said

an oil tanker trying to avoid a crash 
with a soviet fishing trawler wednesday veered into another soviet 
boat which sank in the chilly baltic and killed all 15 crewmen 
officials said 
one of the soviet fishermen was pulled from the sea alive after 
the accident but died as he was being flown to a hospital the coast 
guard and navy gave up the search for the other 14 crewmen eight 
hours after the accident saying there was no hope of finding 
survivors in the 55degree water 
coast guard cmdr topi jarainen called it the worst maritime 
accident in the baltic since world war ii 
the 6000ton finnish oil tanker tebo star en route to amsterdam 
with a cargo of crude oil crunched into the trawler ladushkin just 
after midnight in fair weather and moderate seas 
veikko hintsonen of the suomen petrooli shipping company which 
operated the tanker said in helsinki that the ship veered to avoid 
a collision with another soviet trawler when it hit the ladushkin 
the tebo star was not seriously damaged he said 
the 75footlong trawler sank within minutes said waldemar 
berlin head of the coast guard rescue operation ive worked here 
for 30 years and i cant recall a more serious accident he said 
berlin said most of the soviet crewmen probably were in their 
bunks asleep when the tanker hit their ship 28 miles southwest of 
the swedish island of gotland 
the swedish navy pulled three helicopters and four vessels from 
war games being held nearby to help in the rescue effort 
the ladushkin was resting on the seabed 50 yards below the 
surface berlin said 
jarainen said accidents involving trawlers and tankers are rare 
but fishermen on gotland island said passing tankers sometimes do 
not pay enough attention at night when trawlers are at anchor 
tankers cut down on their crew to make their trips more 
profitable fisherman ulf norrby told national radio then some 
dont keep sufficient watch at night

the american civil liberties union called the 
bush administrations antidrug strategy counterproductive and 
cynical wednesday saying it shortchanges prevention and 
treatment programs while putting overwhelming reliance on the 
criminal justice system 
ira glasser executive director of the 275000member 
organization told a news conference that the war on drugs outlined 
by president bush in his nationally televised speech tuesday night 
amounts to a fullfledged political hoax 
this is a joke glasser said it is a hoax on the public 
it cannot work 
in a statement released at the news conference the aclu said 
drug czar william bennetts longawaited proposal for the bush 
administrations war on drugs is not simply unworkable it is 
counterproductive and cynical 
it said the administrations plan will do little to lessen the 
problems caused by drug use while compromising civil liberties 
overcrowding prisons and costing the taxpayers millions of dollars 
the proposals overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice 
system its underfunding of treatment and prevention programs and 
its utter disregard for the everworsening conditions in our 
nations inner cities dooms it to certain failure the statement 
said 
also criticizing the administrations antidrug strategy were 
several other groups including the national association of criminal 
defense lawyers the criminal justice policy foundation and the 
national organization for the reform of marijuana laws known as 
norml 
in its statement the aclu asserted that bennetts proposal is 
little more than another attempt to fool the public into believing 
that prohibition can work when all the evidence shows that it 
cannot 
the new yorkbased civil liberties group assailed elements of the 
administrations plan including more drug testing of workers more 
penalties for firsttime and occasional users and more pretrial 
forfeiture of vehicles and other assets 
none of these measures will have a significant impact on the 
countrys drug problem all of them represent attacks on basic 
american values like the presumption of innocence the right to be 
free from unreasonable searches and seizures and the right to due 
process of the law it said 
neal r sonnett president of the national association of 
criminal defense lawyers said the administrations plan shows no 
leadership and dooms us to repeat the failures of the past 
instead of ensnaring more people into our already overburdened 
criminal justice system and bursting jails we need to find better 
ways to divert firsttime and nonviolent minor offenders into 
treatment rehabilitation and education programs sonnett said 
eric e sterling president of the criminal justice policy 
foundation another washingtonbased group spoke out in favoring of 
legalizing drugs 
congress can destroy the colombian cartel through legalization 
by changing the drug laws but there is one law congress can never 
repeal the law of supply and demand sterling said 
donald fiedler national director of norml contended that the 
administrations program amounts to declaring war on at least 25 
million fellow citizens who are leading productive lives but for 
their casual or regular use of marijuana

nearly 60 percent of elderly americans would 
pay more for medicares catastrophic illness coverage under a 
congressional proposal to rework the program according to a private 
study released wednesday 
those hardest hit by the house ways and means committee plan 
would be elderly people just above the poverty line and in the lower 
middle class according to families united for senior action an 
advocacy group for the elderly poor 
many affluent senior citizens meanwhile would see their 
payments decrease if the proposal became law families usa said 
the most vulnerable older people in america will make up 
more than half of the losers in the proposed change said ronald 
pollack executive director of the group congress should be 
protecting these people from rising medical costs not hitting them 
with new charges 
losers would outnumber winners in all the states but states with 
lower income levels would tend to be hit hardest pollack said in 
west virginia for example 61 percent of senior couples and 
individuals would pay more while 162 percent would pay less 
overall 575 percent of the nations elderly individuals or 
couples would pay more and 254 percent would pay less families usa 
said the rest would be unaffected by the change 
the yearold catastrophic covrage program limits how much 
medicare beneficiaries must pay for hospital care physician 
services medical supplies and certain outpatient drugs it also 
increases coverage for home health care skilled nursing facilities 
and hospice care and adds breastcancer screening and respite care 
benefits 
congress has been considering a variety of proposals to repeal or 
revise the program in order to appease senior citizens angered at 
their costs for the coverage critics of the proposed ways and means 
revision say it would placate welloff and vocal complainers at 
the expense of poor people who most need lowcost coverage 
a ways and means committee spokesman who asked not to be named 
said the committees proposal was the best plan that legislators 
could agree upon to avoid outright repeal 
thirtyeight percent of those whose costs would increase under 
the ways and means plan have incomes of 90 percent to 149 percent of 
federal poverty guidelines while 79 percent of those whose costs 
would fall have income at 300 percent of the poverty line or above 
according to the families usa report researched by lewinicf a 
division of health and sciences research inc 
seniors citizens with incomes at or below 90 percent of the 
poverty guideline in 1990 and at 100 percent in 1992 are eligible to 
have medicaid pay their medicare premiums and deductibles 
families usa said that despite senior protests the best way to 
protect these seniors is to retain current law should congress 
insist on revising the plan at a minimum it should extend the 
medicaid coverage of medicare costs to people at up to 100 percent 
of the poverty guidelines in 1990 and 150 percent by 1992 it said 
under the current medicare program a 15 percent surtax is 
imposed on federal income tax liabilities over 150 affecting about 
40 of percent of those 65 and older with the surtax rising to 28 
percent by 1993 the maximum surtax payment expected at affect 
about 5 percent of the elderly is capped at 800 in 1989 and rises 
to 1050 in 1993 
the rest of the money comes from a flat supplemental premium 
levied on all but the poorest beneficiaries set at 490 a month in 
1990 
under the ways and means plan the surtax rate would be cut in 
half and the flat monthly premium would rise to 840 in 1990 in 
addition the plan would increase from 600 to 800 in 1991 the 
amount that beneficiaries must pay for prescription drugs before 
qualifying for drug benefits

house speaker thomas s foley said today it is 
unrealistic to expect a tax increase to pay for president bushs 
antidrug package unless bush supports one 
without the administrations support the idea of raising taxes 
is futile the washington democrat told reporters 
bush has said consistently that no tax increase is needed to fund 
his drug war and that money should be diverted from other federal 
programs to pay for it 
but rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said unless the president supports the tax 
increases that will be necessary to fight this war the drug dealers 
are going to win 
most democrats were quick to praise the programs aims announced 
by the president in a nationally televised speech tuesday night 
including tougher penalties for users steppedup interdiction and 
more money for prisons treatment programs education and prevention 
but many questioned the administrations plan to help pay the 
bill by squeezing 716 million from existing programs a subject 
likely to come up thursday when national drug coordinator william 
bennett defends the outline before the senate judiciary committee 
foley predicted that congress would approve spending at least 
the amount the president recommended this year and said next 
year i expect we will be offering more than the presidents 
proposal 
im not going to outline it in detail he said when asked 
what programs could be cut to find the money trust us 
foley said tuesday following a white house briefing for 
congressional leaders that its very difficult to assume we can 
at leat over the long term meet the cost of the drug war without 
some additional revenue coming into the government 
this is a war on drugs not a war on the american taxpayer 
countered minority leader bob dole rkan 
administration budget director richard darman said money can be 
diverted from programs such as juvenile justice economic 
development and immigration reform to help pay for the 79 billion 
drug plan bush outlined tuesday night 
but sen dennis deconcini dariz said bush should look 
elsewhere for the money 
he is suggesting that we do it out of funds the congress isnt 
going to cut deconcini said 
the plan calls for cutting 320 million from grants to help 
states pay for immigration legalization services 194 million from 
the economic development administration 40 million from juvenile 
justice programs 15 million to reclaim lost postal revenue 50 
million from public housing subsidies and 132 million from a 
defense department radio project 
former president reagan repeatedly tried to scrap the eda but 
congress always refused 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting house 
ways and means committee said that unless the president supports 
the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war the drug 
dealers are going to win 
as despicable as drug dealers are they understand economics 
rostenkowski said if you want to play youve got to pay 
but house minority leader robert h michel rill emerged from 
a white house briefing to say that offsetting cuts should get the 
program through its first year 
and then after that were going to have to take a look at it a 
continuing look because its not going to be won in one year and 
itll be a costly venture michel said 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said in 
the formal democratic response to the presidents remarks that the 
plan needed more police prosecutors judges and prisons 
quite frankly the presidents plan is not tough enough bold 
enough or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand biden 
said 
rep don edwards dcalif however accused the president of

a federal judge today ruled jim bakker 
competent to stand trial after a psychiatrist testified the tv 
evangelist was not mentally ill but merely had a panic attack when 
he finally grasped his downfall 
us district judge robert potter said bakkers trial on charges 
of fleecing followers of his ptl ministry would resume later in the 
day 
the ruling came after a hearing for which bakker was brought to 
court from a prison psychiatric unit in leg irons and handcuffs he 
was committed for a psychiatric evaluation there on thursday after 
his personal psychiatrist reported he was hallucinating and cowering 
under a couch 
during the hearing dr sally johnson a psychiatrist at the 
federal correctional institution at butner testified bakker was 
competent to stand trial and has the capacity to get through it 
she said bakker suffered a panic attack last week after a witness 
collapsed during defense cross examination 
for the first time in three years the whole situation came 
home to him and he began to cry she testified the weight of 
all these things began to coalesce and he began crying it was a 
powerful emotional reaction and release 
potter asked bakker to stand and answer questions before he 
released him from the custody of us marshals 
do you understand what you are on trial here for the judge 
asked 
yes sir bakker responded quietly 
asked if he was able to assist his lawyers bakker said im 
very tired but i believe i can 
his wife tammy said as she left court this should not be 
allowed in the united states of america 
potter did not immediately rule on a defense request for a 
mistrial but said he expected the trial to resume at 2 pm

money scandal went on trial aug 28 on conspiracy and fraud 
charges prosecutors said he used nearly 4 million in ministry 
funds to live in high style 
he could could receive 120 years in prison and more than 5 
million in fines if convicted

after her husband this morning and brought him a suit shirt tie 
and shoes he was wearing gray pants and a sport shirt as he entered

go to jail over the ministrys fundraising practices bakker 
knelt and prayed at nelsons side nelson came to within seconds and 
said he was laid low by the flu 
johnson said she didnt detect any signs of mental disease 
its not abnormal for someone to be experiencing those symptoms in 
a trial situation especially if it comes on the heels of a major 
disruption in a persons life she said 
she described bakkers symptoms as moderate depression and 
situational anxiety and detected dependent features in his 
personality and narcissism she said bakker was coherent and 
cooperative during his evaluation

showing american films 
in a statement the directors demanded the release of the two

continue

snake dealer to release nonpoisonous snakes into theaters showing 
uip films last year

state agriculture officials 
announced today they will begin immediate spraying to protect 
californias 14 billion produce industry from an infestation of the 
voracious mediterranean fruit fly 
the decision required a declaration of an emergency by gov 
george deukmejian who signed the order today after 16 medflies were 
found in the mountain view area since last week said gera curry 
food and agriculture department spokeswoman 
the spraying of the pesticide malathion take place in northern 
californias santa clara county 
ground spraying was to begin about noon and an aerial spraying 
will be done on friday if the weather is clear the department said 
beginning sept 18 the state will also release 30 million 
sterile medflies a week until biologists decide the infestation is 
destroyed 
medflies lay eggs in 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables 
including all citrus fruits apples cherries avocados and tomatoes 
and are capable of devastating californias 14 billion annual 
agricultural industry 
when medfly eggs hatch the larvae feed on the fruit which spoil 
and fall to the ground 
immediate ground and aerial spraying of malathion was recommended 
tuesday by a group of international experts in pest eradication 
the advisory group which discussed the infestation during a 
conference call from such locations as guatemala hawaii and 
florida said other options available involve quarantine or 
treatment only of the affected plants 
under state law aerial spraying of malathion requires at least 
24hour notice to each home in the area a state study in 1987 found 
no damage to peoples health as a result of largescale spraying in 
the early 1980s 
about 300 members of the california conservation corps were 
distributing leaflets today to about 100000 homes in the area the 
leaflets described time and place of spraying possible health 
hazards and steps to protect vehicles 
a 198081 medfly infestation in santa clara county caused a 
bitter debate over the use of chemical sprays helicopter spraying 
of malathion over eight san franciscoregion counties eventually 
wiped out the pests 
an infestation in the los angeles area last year cost 2 million 
to eradicate by way of malathion spraying and the release of 700 
million sterile flies another infestation in 198082 cost 100 
million 
in the early 1980s the state spent more than 100 million to 
eradicate the pest in parts of central california and los angeles

president reagan authorized john poindexter to 
send letters to congress on which part of the indictment against the 
former national security adviser is based poindexters lawyers said 
today 
frederick robinson poindexters lawyer told a hearing in 
federal court that the former presidents notes on various meetings 
with his national security adviser should be produced for poindexter 
as part of his defense 
poindexter is charged in the irancontra scandal with conspiracy 
two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements 
robinson depicted reagan as having approved administration 
responses to congress about the nicaraguan contras the indictment 
against poindexter depends in part on those responses 
poindexter went to the president to talk about sending 
letters responding to congressional inquiries said robinson 
us district court judge harold greene asked whether he was 
suggesting that the president said you go ahead and do this 
yes responded robinson 
the president was saying i want these things done robinson 
said 
i think that the presidents notes we believe will show 
discussions about the letters that were sent to congress and the 
appropriateness of any response said robinson 
the congressional inquiries to which the reagan white house was 
responding focused on whether the administration was assisting the 
nicaraguan contras in violation of a congressional ban on military 
aid to the rebel force 
two of poindexters responses referred to yearold answers his 
predecessor robert mcfarlane sent to congress denying that the 
national security council staff was supplying military advice or 
raising funds for the nicaraguan rebels mcfarlane subsequently 
pleaded guilty to withholding information from congress in 
connection with his letters 
one of the charges against poindexter is that he obstructed 
congress in july and august 1986 by sending the letters he also is 
charged with conspiracy to obstruct congressional inquiries in 
connection with the letters 
robinson said poindexter is entitled to a wide range of material 
for his defense including notes from thenvice president bush 
white house chief of staff don regan and defense secretary caspar 
weinberger 
robinson said that any time bush missed a meeting admiral 
poindexter briefed him 
poindexter wants the judge to direct the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh to obtain some of reagans notes so that they 
can be turned over to the former national security adviser 
walshs office obtained some typewritten excerpts of reagans 
diaries for the irancontra trial of oliver north norths lawyers 
subpoenaed reagans diaries but us district court judge gerhard

american workers posted a modest productivity 
improvement in the second quarter of the year with significant 
gains by factory workers leading the way the government said 
wednesday 
the labor department said productivity in the nonfarm portion of 
the economy increased at an annual rate of 07 percent in the 
apriljune period up from the 02 percent gain reported in 
preliminary data last month and much better than the 13 percent 
decline in the first quarter 
the department said unit labor costs a key inflation indicator 
increased at an annual rate of 49 percent in the quarter down 
from the 62 percent jump reported for the first quarter but 
nonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation 
analysts said the small productivity gain was consistent with the 
recent slowing of the economys growth rate 
but they said poor performance in the nonfinancial corporate 
sector a category including most service industries in which 
productivity fell and labor costs rose at a rapid 111 percent 
annual rate suggested inflation was still around 
the future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging 
because the serviceproducing sector makes up roughly 80 percent of 
the economy said allen sinai chief economist for boston co 
economic advisors 
the 07 percent increase is a low number but consistent with 
the cyclical problems that typically occur as growth slows down 
said economist roger brinner of drimcgraw hill employers are 
reluctant to trim their work force so that when the economy 
downshifts you have to expect a dip in productivity growth 
the secondquarter improvement came as output grew at an annual 
rate of 24 percent while hours worked expanded by 17 percent 
gains in productivity output per hours worked are seen as 
vital to economic growth at times of near full employment and tight 
labor markets in skilled jobs 
improved productivity in manufacturing also helps us 
competitiveness in world markets workers in manufacturing posted a 
productivity gain of 29 percent at an annual rate in the second 
quarter up from the 24 percent increase reported in the 
preliminary data 
the labor department said hourly compensation rose at an annual 
rate of 56 percent in the quarter but consumer inflation continued 
to more than erase the wage gains real hourly compensation hourly 
compensation minus consumer inflation fell 07 percent the 
department said 
the preliminary data had put the hourly compensation increase at 
an annual rate of 55 percent and the decline in real wages at 09 
percent in the first quarter hourly compensation rose at an annual 
rate of 48 percent and real wages declined 06 percent 
the 29 percent annualrate productivity gain in manufacturing in 
the second quarter followed a 21 percent gain in the januarymarch 
period unit labor costs in manufacturing fell at an annual rate of 
04 percent after increasing at an annual rate of 10 percent in the 
first quarter 
we have a lean and mean manufacturing sector said sinai 
this is really something to cheer about in the continued strong 
performance in productivity and cost control in the manufacturing 
sector 
the secondquarter manufacturing gain came as output rose at an 
annual rate of 29 percent while the number of hours worked held 
steady after rising at an annual rate of 11 percent in the first 
quarter 
factory workers saw their real wages fall at an annual rate of 
37 percent in the second quarter with inflation stripping away an 
increase of 24 percent at an annual rate in hourly compensation 
in manufacturing the labor department said 
a separate figure that includes the farm sector of the economy 
showed that productivity rose at an annual rate of 13 percent as 
output climbed 19 percent while hours worked rose by 06 percent 
the report attributed that gain to improved productivity by farm 
workers

president bush is largely responsibile for the 
slow pace of filling key government positions and his complaint of 
senate foot dragging is unfounded and unfair senate majority 
leader george mitchell said wednesday 
the maine democrat told the senate that of the 432 fulltime 
executive branch positions requiring senate confirmation there are 
200 jobs for which no nomination has been submitted or no 
announcement made that the incumbent would be retained 
thus nearly eight months after he took office the president 
has failed to make nominations for nearly half of the fulltime 
positions in executive departments and independent agencies which 
require senate confirmation mitchell said 
whose responsibility is that he asked it is certainly not 
the senates 
mitchell noted that after he met with bush on aug 4 to discuss 
nominations white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the president wanted to express his deep concern that these 
nominations were being held up for artificial reasons not related 
to the candidates themselves 
mitchell said that based on a careful review of the status of 
the bush nominations to date he is urging that the president 
discontinue such criticism 
it is unfounded and unfair mitchll said the principal 
problem is in the slow pace at which nominations are being made not 
in the pace at which nominations once made are being processed 
he said there are 48 leadership positions in government 
departments that are totally vacant with no nominations 
submitted and no holdovers from the reagan administration in place 
out of 14 cabinet deartments only the department of 
transportation has no totally vacant positions mitchell said 
there are five totally vacant positions in the executive office of 
the president and another 20 in major independent agencies 
in the field of public health mitchell said there is no nominee 
for surgeon general commissioner of aging or for the position of 
administrator of the health care finance administration 
in education he said there are no nominees to fill assistant 
secretary positions in elementary and secondary education or in 
vocational and adult education and civil rights 
the vital 1990 census is rapidly approaching and there is no 
nominee to be director of the census bureau mitchell said 
whose responsibility is that 
mitchell asserted that the senate by way of contrast has 
confirmed 212 bush nominees 90 percent of them within two months of 
the time the nominations was received 
mitchell did not include in his count nominations for us 
ambassadors us marshalls or us attorneys

a federal appeals court today lifted an 
injunction blocking the cutting of oldgrowth timber on federal land 
in oregon but kept alive a lawsuit by environmentalists to protect 
the northern spotted owl 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco ruled that 
a federal law backed by the timber industry prohibited the 
conservationists from challenging the us bureau of land 
managements logging plans 
the court removed an injunction it had imposed june 7 the 
injunction had prohibited cutting of oldgrowth timber within 21 
miles of spotted owl nests 
scientists say the owl depends on old growth timber for its 
survival and the us fish and wildlife service is studying the owl 
for possible designation as a threatened species 
its a stunning defeat for the conservation community said 
boyd peters a spokesman for the environmental group headwaters 
it wasnt immediately clear when loggers would allowed to go in 
to cut down more old growth timber which is generally considered 
trees that are hundreds of years old such trees coveted by loggers 
for their superior timber 
timber interests argued the injunction posed a threat to the 
pacific northwests timber supply and would cost thousands of people 
their jobs in wood products plants and mills 
the appeals court said that under law environmentalists could 
not challenge an existing blm timber management plan 
however the court revived the conservationists claims that the 
destruction of spotted owl habitat violated the migratory bird 
treaty act and federal oregon and california law 
a lowercourt judge had dismissed those claims saying they 
should have raised earlier 
the appeals court ordered us district judge helen frye to 
reconsider the claims saying environmental groups had acted as soon 
as they could after getting new information about possible danger to 
the owl

students and teachers infected with the aids 
virus should be free to attend class without fear their disease will 
be made public a new guide for the nations schools said wednesday 
someone at school has aids released by the national 
association of state boards of education said the deadly virus is 
not transmitted by casual everyday contact so confidentiality 
should be school policy 
parents shouldnt have to reveal their childs infection if the 
decision is sanctioned by a physician who finds the child does not 
have secondary infections such as tuberculosis said the guidelines 
the report suggests that school superintendents be notified but 
even those decisions should be approved by the infected person and 
a students parents or guardians 
the report developed by a panel of 20 organizations representing 
law medicine public health and education groups is an update of 
guidelines issued by the centers of disease control in 1985 
until now many people have been fearful that aids could be 
transmitted at school said the booklet we have enough 
information to stop worrying about this what we do need to worry 
about and the place to put our energy and concern is into 
education 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease 
that destroys the bodys ability to fight infection the disease is 
spread through the exchange of body fluids infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus popularly called hiv 
the guide said about 15 million people in the united states are 
infected with the hiv virus more than 102000 cases of aids have 
been diagnosed in this country since 1981 and more than 59000 of 
those victims have died 
lloyd kolbe director of cdcs division of adolescent and school 
health said about 1276 children from birth up to 19yearsold have 
been diagnosed with aids 
in recent years children infected by the aids virus have been 
banned from classrooms and in a few cases the entire family forced 
to leave town infected school staff have reportedly been harassed 
or fired 
the association of state and territorial health officials 
described the guide as clear concise and straightforward 
information the council of chief state school officers predicted 
the booklet will be of inestimable value because it is both 
scientifically accurate and sensitive to the mission of schools 
jim williams of the national education associations health 
information network said we revised our policy on the issue of 
confidentiality and testing of students based on the guides 
recommendation 
beverly farquhar director of the national association of school 
nurses added this has really helped our cause a great deal 
she said school officials who in the past had been reluctant now 
enthusiastically allow the association to conduct special workshops 
for teachers on the proper handling of bodily fluids 
the new booklet gives educators uptodate knowledge about aids 
and how the disease is spread said brenda welburn of the school 
board association previous guidelines suggested that schools be 
cautious about children who bite or who werent toilet trained in 
case the aids virus might be transmitted through saliva or handling 
diapers 
we now know that hiv is not transmitted through saliva or 
urine said welburn even the possibility that the aids virus 
would be transmitted through simple exposure to blood is extremely 
low 
so the suggested policy is to allow students who are infected to 
attend school and be entitled to all rights privileges and services 
received by other students the guide said 
no school employee shall be terminated nonrenewed demoted 
suspended transferred or subjected to adverse action based solely 
on the fact that he or she is infected with hiv it said 
those who become ill should be allowed to retain all benefits 
that are provided for other school employees with longterm diseases 
or disabling conditions the guide said 
since confidentiality is a key point in the new guidelines 
school officials are encouraged to handle the situation in a 
standard confidential manner 
mandatory testing has no place in the nations schools the 
guidelines said the suggested policy states mandatory screening 
for communicable diseases that are not spread by casual contact 
such as hiv infection shall not be a condition for school entry or 
attendance or for employment or continued employment

the city and a group of parents told a judge 
today that retarded people living at home are likely to backslide in 
their skills because the state cut off money for workshops training 
and other services 
the plaintiffs asked a commonwealth court judge to restore 79 
million cut june 30 from programs that benefit 7750 retarded people 
living at home 
unless the aid is restored thousands of retarded people may be 
forced into institutions against their families wishes in order to 
get help the city has charged 
the state of pennsylvania contends it is meeting its obligation 
under law to dole out its limited resources fairly 
david ferleger a lawyer for the parents said that if the 
parents prevail he will then argue that all retarded people living 
at home not just the 7550 philadelphians involved in the lawsuit 
today have a right to the such services at home 
leona fialkowski whose son david 27 was dropped from the 
program on july 14 and audrey coccia whose daughter gina 22 was 
similarly removed testified their children have been regressing 
because of a lack of services 
we are starting to see regression in david in his efforts in 
walking and selfhelp mrs fialkowski said he needs attention 
to maintain what he has he cannot walk now the distance he could 
walk before he is being harmed because of the lack of training and 
the lack of physical therapy 
mrs coccia said her daughter had been learning how to work and 
was taught living skills and now most of the time she watches 
television follows her father and me around the house she said 
ferleger said that if he succeeds in proving that all retarded 
people at home are entitled to such programs thousands more 
retarded people across pennsylvania will receive services at home at 
an additional cost to the state of about 30 million of which 
onethird would go to philadelphia 
this could involve more than 100000 persons with retardation 
across the country he said 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals recently ruled that 
reducing such services does not violate a retarded persons rights 
under the us constititution the court sent the case back to the 
state courts 
richard gold first deputy city solicitor said budget 
constraints since 1983 in retardation programs have forced the city 
in the last two months to end or reduce minimum essential 
services to retarded people living at home 
we contend they have a right to continue to receive those 
services under state law and the state is obligated to pay 90 
percent of those costs while the city picks up the rest of the 
bill gold said he said the citys allocation from the state is 
79 million short 
but assistant attorney general gwen mosley representing the 
state said pennsylvania is doing all it is required to do she said 
the state budgeted about 1053 million of which philadelphias 
share is approximately 20 million 
some people need residential services and they cant get it 
and some need athome services and they cant get it she said 
there are waiting lists the need outstrips the resources 
available 
ms mosley said the state is required by law to distribute its 
money in a fair and reasonable manner 
this means that all the counties will get some but not all the 
monies they need she said

chelsea high welcomed back its students 
wednesday with signs in english spanish cambodian and vietnamese 
reflecting its melting pot demographics the signs also greeted a 
newcomer boston university which will run chelseas troubled 
schools for the next decade 
a lot of things are still tentative but the students and 
faculty are looking forward to change principal mary raimo said 
of the unprecedented takeover of a public school system by a private 
institution 
change will not come quickly to 80yearold chelsea high or the 
five other aging schools in this poor community although there are 
immediate plans for a school for chronic truants computer labs and 
new curricula the university has loftier longerterm goals 
officials talk of fostering childrens education by schooling 
parents in reading nutrition and child care the talk is of 
creating an atmosphere that stresses education long before children 
walk into school for the first time 
this is not a cute little project involving some classrooms 
said peter greer boston universitys dean of education who will 
oversee the management team were talking about a philosophy that 
education can emancipate the underclass in the united states 
but the university faces significant hurdles many in this 
community of 26000 remain wary about surrendering their childrens 
education to academicians the teachers union and hispanic parents 
have filed suit challenging the agreement others fret the 
university wont raise the 2 million to 3 million a year it 
promised for special programs 
the money was supposed to come in hand over fist but we 
havent seen it said elizabeth mcbride chairwoman of the chelsea 
school committee 
the unique agreement between the university and chelsea follows 
years of hard times for 3500student school system an influx of 
immigrants from latin america and southeast asia swelled the school 
population declining tax revenues cut school budgets 
chelsea now spends 1600 less per student than the national 
average test scores graduation rates and teacher salaries are 
among the lowest in massachusetts 
the situation led to meetings with john silber the president of 
boston university who has long sought to use his schools resources 
in public education after months of negotiations among the school 
committee aldermen and the state legislature an agreement was 
reached in june giving the university control of the schools 
the school committee has advise and consent powers over bu 
programs it can negate university plans with a twothirds vote but 
cannot overrule personnel decisions 
i feel that its taking away the power of elected officials 
taking away voters rights said mrs mcbride who six of her 
children through the communitys schools 
but if chelsea residents have lost some political control over 
their schools bu wants to get them involved in a much more intimate 
way 
the university experimented with a literacy program this spring 
for mothers and their young children twentythree families met with 
teachers and tutors twohours a day for several weeks while 
children were introduced to reading their mothers improved their 
own reading and learned how to teach their children 
if were successful we will help parents be aware they instill 
the love of learning said jean paratore an associate bu 
professor who heads the program 
the program is a precursor to bus plans for greater involvement 
of the family in education greer talks of adult classes on 
nutrition parenting child care and even prenatal care 
even if you pour zillions of dollars in classrooms and 
teachers it isnt going to work unless you have healthy students 
supported by their parents said greer former superintendent of 
portland maines schools 
yet money is an issue bu officials talked of raising 50 million 
through the life of its contract with chelsea while more money is 
expected only 726000 in pledges were in hand by late august 
leaving many programs on hold 
and there are other anxieties chelseas teachers are mindful of 
silbers stormy relations with his universitys unions hispanics 
fearful the new management might end bilingual education went to 
court to try to stop the takeover 
some rough road has been smoothed over for now the bu management 
team has several bilingual experts including diana lam a 
peruvianborn bilingual expert picked to be chelseas new school 
superintendent the union has signed an interim contract with bu 
that gives teachers an average bonus of 1300

many sources report an explosion aug 17 
at an iraqi missile plant south of baghdad and some put the death 
toll at more than 700 but iraqs obsessively secret government has 
said nothing 
western diplomats reached by telephone wednesday in baghdad 
capital of iraq confirmed an explosion occurred at the huge missile 
complex but said they had no details 
no information was available on what caused the explosion but 
there was no immediate indication of sabotage 
in london the daily independent quoted diplomats and middle east 
sources wednesday as saying 700 people were killed including 
egyptian engineers helping the iraqis develop a new missile 
an official of the rebel patriotic union of kurdistan reported by 
telephone that sources in iraq said 700 bodies were removed from the 
plant and the casualty toll might reach 2500 dead and wounded the 
official known to the associated press asked that his name and 
location be concealed 
a british broadcasting corp report said egypts defense ministry 
confirmed the explosion but an army general at the ministry said 
privately i have no knowledge of an explosion or of egyptian 
wounded coming to cairo from iraq 
the independent said the casualties included egyptian personnel 
who were flown to cairo in three egyptian air force transports aug 
18 
iraq with egyptian help is believed to be developing a modified 
version of argentinas mediumrange condor 2 which the iraqis call 
the badr 2000 at the plant 40 miles south of baghdad 
the independent quoted egyptian sources as saying egyptian 
casualties were taken to the maadi military hospital in cairo the 
report said the hospital was closed to civilians aug 19 and 
specialists in skin grafts burns and respiratory ailments were 
brought in 
a senior official of the hospital told the the associated press 
on wednesday it had not been closed to civilians he denied reports 
that large numbers of egyptian casualties from iraq had been taken 
there 
according to the kurdish rebel official the explosion started a 
fire that destroyed at least 30 percent of the missile complex 
which is said to include laboratories factories and living quarters 
for workers 
several reports said the iraqis used firefighting aircraft to 
fight the blaze but could not bring it under control until aug 25 
how many people worked at the plant was not known 
sources linked to other kurdish rebel groups said the facility 
included a chemical weapons factory and that some casualties had 
wounds consistent with chemical agents 
there was no independent confirmation but iraq is known to 
produce poison gases the united nations cited iraq several times 
for using chemical weapons outlawed under a 1925 geneva protocol 
during the eightyear war with iran 
western military analysts have said for months that iraq was 
developing the badr 2000 to carry nuclear or chemical warheads up to 
1000 kilometers or more than 600 miles 
the kurdish sources said the missile complex was protected by an 
elite military force and covered nearly 1000 square miles which 
indicated it might include a testfiring range 
israel fears such weapons as the badr 2000 which could reach 
targets within its borders will erode its traditional technological 
superiority over its arab neighbors its air force destroyed a 
nuclear reactor near baghdad in june 1981 which the israelis said 
soon would be capable of producing weapons 
officials in israel say west german french and italian companies 
have been involved in the badr 2000 project 
iraq has warned israel against another air strike at strategic 
facilities and has tightened antiaircraft missile defenses at key 
installations

little edward saw the hospital room that has 
been his home almost since birth 4 months ago suddenly fill with 
bright lights and big people and he did what comes naturally to 
infants 
he cried 
and president bush touring district of columbia general 
hospitals ward for babies abandoned at birth by crackaddicted 
mothers did what comes naturally to a father of six and grandfather 
of 11 
he picked edward up and cradled him against his shoulder 
whats the matter with you what in the worlds the matter with 
you asked the president in a soft voice 
instantly the baby stopped bawling and flashed a big smile 
you just want a little attention dont you see it works 
the president garbed in a blue hospital gown told his health 
secretary louis sullivan 
for bush the visit wednesday to the pediatrics ward of dc 
general was a chance to dramatize his new national strategy to fight 
a menace that finds its youngest victims still in the womb 
edward and a dozen other infants at dc general are socalled 
boarder babies abandoned after birth by mothers addicted to 
drugs 
the babies even after being cured of their own drug 
dependencies still must wait for months until foster care can be 
found for them 
at least one of the children has tested positive for the hiv 
virus which causes aids 
bush out of sight of cameras toured other rooms where the 
hospital staff was nursing tiny underweight infants to health and 
caring for others for whom the prognosis was grim 
dr stanley sinkford the chief of pediatrics showed bush one 
infant who had bacterial meningitis a swollen brain and has already 
undergone several operations the mother who left a home phone 
number that turned out to be a local barber shop has not been found 
in the room of an infant who tested positive for the aids 
antibody bush asked does that baby have a chance to get well 
we dont know sinkford replied 
in the intensive care nursery bush peered at the tiny frail 
babies hooked up to intravenous lines and monitors 
whats this guys problem bush asked about one infant 
just born too soon said sinkford 
twenty percent of the 2025 babies born at dc general last year 
were exposed to drugs in the womb mostly cocaine hospital 
officials said 
fourteen to 15 percent are lowweight births below the 5pound 
mark that signifies danger that is double the national rate 
edward and a dozen other boarder babies generally are healthy 
but homeless they are not eligible for adoption because the mothers 
never relinquished their legal rights before abandoning them 
hospital officials said 
marilou king chairwoman of the dc general hospital commission 
said the hospital is considering opening an orphanage on its grounds 
to meet the problem each boarder baby costs the hospital an average 
of 100000 a year 
they cannot get maternal love in a hospital setting said dr 
mehnur abedin the neonatologist in charge of the nursery 
later back at the white house bush told reporters i was 
deeply touched by seeing these abandoned babies 
the commitment of these nurses and these doctors to these kids 
that are born without hope is so encouraging the only love they may 
ever get in their lives is when theyre a month old and weve got 
to change that bush said 
he said it underscores the need for community involvement and 
voluntary efforts to solve the drug problem 
he promised to work my hardest to make the national drug 
strategy work but said its at the level of love and the level 
of local education and parental concern neighbor involving with 
neighbor in the life of another that this problem is going to 
be solved 
im absolutely convinced of it and im more convinced of it 
than ever after holding in my arms one of those abandoned babies

seymour hersh who 20 years ago was the first 
reporter to describe the my lai massacre says he was put onto the 
story by a telephone tip from a lawyer he barely knew 
writing in the octobernovember issue of memories magazine hersh 
recalls working as a freelance writer in washington on oct 22 
1969 when he got a telephone call from geoffrey cowan 
cowan told hersh about a rumor hed heard the army was going to 
secretly courtmartial a soldier at fort benning ga for killing 
civilians in south vietnam he asked hersh if he was interested 
to this day im not sure why i was writes hersh who had 
covered the pentagon for the associated press and had come away 
hating the war convinced that its emphasis on body counts and 
statistical success was turning the officer corps into 
professional liars 
but hersh says he also came to realize that many officers at the 
pentagon were as troubled as i was maybe it was that 
understanding dimly perceived that set me to work on cowans tip 
hersh confirmed the massacre with a pentagon source and visited a 
military defense lawyer in utah he went to fort benning eventually 
tracked down the key subject of the investigation lt william l 
calley jr and broke the story of how a platoon of charlie company 
commanded by calley killed about 400 civilians in the hamlet of my 
lai 4 on march 16 1968 
when he located calley in quarters ordinarily reserved for senior 
officers hersh writes i think he understood in some primitive 
way that we would talk and then i would write and his life would 
never be the same again he was right neither would mine 
initially accused of killing 109 civilians calley was convicted 
in 1970 of murdering 22 but served only three years before his 
release hersh won a pulitzer prize for his reporting on the 
incident

a drug baron whose capture and extradition 
sparked antiamerican riots that left five people dead in honduras 
was convicted of cocaine smuggling today 
honduran billionaire juan ramon matta ballesteros 45 was 
accused of overseeing a ring that distributed 72 million worth of 
cocaine in los angeles the drug enforcement administration said he 
controlled a narcotics empire worth up to 2 billion 
the federal jury found matta guilty of conspiracy running a 
continuing criminal enterprise possession with intent to distribute 
cocaine and distribution of cocaine 
matta faces 10 years and life in prison at sentencing oct 5 
stolar said 
defense attorney martin stolar sought to portray matta as a 
legitimate businessman who was the largest employer in honduras the 
government argued he was a kingpin of the powerful cocaine cartel 
based in cali colombia that smuggled tons of cocaine into arizona 
and southern california through mexico 
were sending the right message that we want to send to the 
colombian government that if they extradite drug kingpins we will 
prosecute them to the full extent of the law said assistant us 
attorney jimmy gurule 
stolar argued that matta was illegally extradited from honduras 
which does not have an extradition treaty with the united states 
police and troops arrested matta in a predawn raid on his 
tegucigalpa home in 1988 and deported him to the united states by 
way of the dominican republic the honduran constitution forbids the 
extradition of honduran citizens 
enraged over the extradition some 2000 demonstrators burned the 
us embassy annex five hondurans died in a week of disturbances 
the charges stemmed from a 1981 raid on a van nuys apartment 
complex that netted 19 million in cash and 114 pounds of cocaine 
at that time the largest seizure of the drug in california 
also seized were ledgers tracing the drugs to el negro or 
the black one a name a witness said was used by matta 
stolar said his client was a victim of overwhelming publicity 
from colombia and washington that culminated in president bushs 
speech unveiling a battle plan for the war on drugs tuesday night 
stolar said he had sent a telegram to the president asking him to 
withhold his speech until the verdict was returned he said he 
received no response 
the cocaine wars and the war against drugs have been frontpage 
news for three weeks more than half the length of this trial 
stolar said that kind of prejudicial publicity makes it difficult 
for a jury to concentrate on what happens in the courtroom 
the governments key witness was hector barona becerra a former 
colombian cocaine trafficker who said he made smuggling flights for 
matta in 1981 
barona said he was introduced to the defendant in cali and knew 
him by the names jose campo and el negro stolar argued that 
el negro was a common nickname in latin america

the united states blamed a christian military 
commander today for forcing the evacuation of the american embassy 
in beirut by threatening to expose ambassador john mccarthy and his 
staff to a good dose of christian terrorism 
while vowing that the united states would not abandon lebanon 
forever state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also cited 
as a reason for the pullout a reported statement by gen michel aoun 
to a french newspaper that perhaps he should take 20 american 
hostages 
she gave no indication when the 40 americans might return to 
their posts or if the united states had any new diplomatic 
approaches to seek an end to the 15year civil war that has torn the 
middle eastern country apart 
we have a responsibility to insure the safety of our 
personnel the spokeswoman said we plan to go back to beirut as 
soon as conditions permit the evacuation does not represent 
diminution of our intention to try to help lebanon in its time of 
trouble 
some 1000 demonstrators backing aoun had blocked the embassy 
while a protest leader threatened that the blockade would be moved 
closer to the building and us personnel could enter and leave only 
at their own risk ms tutwiler said 
the unidentified leader warned that an indefinite next step 
would take place today she said and a telephone caller 
threatened to shoot down the us helicopter that brought supplies 
and messages to the embassy 
as gen aouns threats and implications about the us grew 
nastier the department and the embassy were in close touch through 
the labor day weekend ms tutwiler said 
after talking to mccarthy by telephone secretary of state james 
a baker iii met at 11 am tuesday with president bush who 
approved their recommendation to evacuate the embassy 
bush baker defense secretary dick cheney national security 
adviser brent scowcroft white house chief of staff john sununu and 
assistant secretary of state john kelly then met in the afternoon to 
discuss implementing the decision ms tutwiler said 
she said there was unanimous agteement on the move despite 
previous administration statements that the beirut embassy had to 
remain open despite the fighting between christian and moslem forces 
in order to play a diplomatic role in trying to attain a ceasefire 
we regret having to evacuate the embassy and the actions by 
gen aoun and his followers that made it necessary ms tutwiler 
said 
in an angry statement directed at the christian leader the us 
spokeswoman said we were told yesterday by reliable journalists 
on the ground that gen aoun said that lebanon needed a good dose of 
christian terrorism and that on friday sept 2 aoun told the 
french newspaper figaro that perhaps he should take 20 american 
hostages 
abdallah bouhabib the lebanese ambassador to washington 
disputed the us assessment 
we think that there was no danger whatsoever for the american 
diplomats there he told the associated press there have been 
no real threats the demonstration was democratic like any 
demonstration 
the ambassador who said he was notified of the evacuation 
tuesday night described the demonstration as a result of 
frustration of asking for more assistance from a friendly 
superpower

sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
agriculture committee called wednesday for congress to redirect 
us foreign aid to protect the world environment 
he told the senate foreign relations committee he will introduce 
a bill aimed at helping countries develop economic alternatives that 
will save forests and other natural resources 
we must make some tough choices focusing limited foreign aid 
funds on critical problems tropical deforestation and energy waste 
and in critical nations even if we dont have programs there now 
he said 
according to a statement by leahys office the international 
climate change and tropical forestry act of 1989 would be aimed at 
providing more aid to third world countries where development often 
means the destruction of tropical rain forests 
the bill would authorize 10 million through the agency for 
international development for programs to improve energy efficiency 
and the use of renewable energy resources in developing nations it 
would also call for stronger forestry research programs promote 
international cooperation on reducing gas emissions 
leahy said rising world temperatures threaten farming in the 
united states and other countries of the northern hemisphere many 
scientists believe burning tropical forests and increased use of 
coal and oil as fuels contribute to a general warming of the globe 
leahy has already introduced a bill that would force lower 
emissions within the united states of gases such as carbon dioxide 
believed to have the same effect 
global climate change is a major threat to agriculture 
throughout the world he said 
with a doubling of carbon dioxide corn production could be 
reduced by 25 percent increased temperatures could cut world rice 
production by as much as 40 percent 
leahy told reporters india and brazil are countries where more 
us aid could be used india gets some direct us aid mostly in 
loans to buy us food but the program has been reduced in recent 
years brazil does not get us economic help 
most direct us aid goes to countries seen as important to us 
security such as israel egypt and the philippines 
but foreign military sales is not necessarily where we should 
target leahy said in the interview traditional aid wont help 
the environment

a littleknown state assemblyman from queens is 
spending 400000 this week to become a wellknown state assemblyman 
from queens a slightly betterknown former schools chancellor is 
spending 220000 
their objective to approach the fame of the very wellknown 
elizabeth holtzman and starting last week shes spending 500000 
such is life in the city comptrollers race a contest for the 
second mostpowerful citywide elective office that has been 
overshadowed by a close mayoral election and dominated by holtzman 
a brooklyn district attorney 
but it is a fight the assemblyman alan hevesi and the 
exchancellor frank macchiarola are waging with vigor jointly 
they hope to hold holtzman under 40 percent in the democratic 
primary forcing a runoff individually each hopes to finish second 
and thus emerge as her runoff opponent 
the eventual democratic nominee will face only token opposition 
in the general election nov 7 
we have a shot cant ask for more hevesi 49 an 18year 
member of the state assembly said this week we think the whole 
thing will crystallize three days before the election 
with the primary this tuesday that leaves little time 
macchiarola popularity polls put him in the teens hevesi has only 
singledigit support although wednesday he was endorsed by a fourth 
candidate assemblyman jerrold nadler who dropped out 
but while holtzman leads solidly she slipped to 37 percent in a 
new york newsday poll conducted last week and released wednesday 
the first time she has fallen under the 40 percent threshold 
if she gets under 40 the guy who comes in second has got a very 
good chance of beating her said norman adler a veteran political 
strategist liz is a mile wide and an inch deep the only thing 
people know about her is her name 
holtzman 47 made her name as a congresswoman in the 1970s when 
she served on the house committee on watergate and on the budget 
committee she ran for the us senate in 1980 narrowly losing to 
republican alfonse damato and won office as brooklyn district 
attorney in 1982 
she was frontrunner from the start in the race for comptroller a 
seat vacated after 16 years by harrison j goldin who is running 
for mayor the comptroller as the citys chief fiscal officer 
conducts audits and manages 30 billion in pension funds 
holtzman has conducted a confident campaign steering clear of a 
televised debate and dismissing macchiarola hevesi and nadler as 
the gang of three 
my candidates attack me for having name recognition as if it 
were a disease she said this week its not simply name 
recognition that i have its what people know about me and 
associate with me that ive worked hard vigorously and well for 
the people of this city 
but her opponents mention other attributes a brittle public 
persona and a reputation for staff disharmony she has one major 
problem declared nadler her atrociously incompetent conduct of 
the das office 
less biased analysts have reached conclusions that are tamer but 
still damaging to serve as an effective comptroller will take 
political grace and skill the new york times editorialized last 
month those are not the first words that come to mind about ms 
holtzman it endorsed hevesi 
so did two other dailies the daily news and new york newsday 
points being hit by hevesi in an avalanche of television ads 
unleashed tuesday new yorkers who miss it on the tube may catch it 
in their mail hevesi is sending out 350000 postcards this week 
touting his endorsements 
nobodys ever heard of me he said after 400000 a lot 
of people are going to have heard of me 
macchiarola 48 who started his 220000 television blitz last 
week has enlivened the race with ads touting him as the fighting 
professor hes a business professor at columbia university with 
a combative style in one debate he called holtzman thick

a leading antiapartheid advocacy group 
lambasted president bush on wednesday for not condemning the south 
african government and not supporting the escalating defiance 
campaign by the black majority 
transafrica urged the bush administration to prevent the 
rescheduling of 21 billion that south africa owes us banks the 
loans are due next june 
bush has been an extraordinarily indecisive president 
randall robinson executive director of transafrica told a news 
conference we cant afford an american president who fears taking 
a moral position 
bush has not made any statement since the defiance campaign began 
several weeks ago with boycotts and demonstrations at segregated 
public places it was capped wednesday with a general strike to 
protest wednesdays south african legislative elections from which 
blacks were excluded 
at the white house officials said bush sent a letter several 
weeks ago to anglican archbishop desmond tutu a leading black south 
african foe of apartheid tutu was teargassed by police and briefly 
detained last week 
the officials said the note expressed us support for a 
negotiated powersharing agreement between blacks and whites 
the state department meanwhile criticized the south african 
elections with spokeswoman margaret tutwiler saying the voting 
offers only part of the south african community a chance to voice 
its views the majority must be given an opportunity to peacefully 
voice theirs 
robinson called the state department comments inadequate 
utterances that give comfort to the south african government 
the only way to bring the south african government to the 
negotiating table is to convince it that failing to do so would be 
too costly he said 
the bush administration is wrong to assume that acting president 
fw de klerk is more liberal than his predecessor pw botha 
robinson said de klerk is smoother brighter and better 
educated but is ideologicallly just as segregationist robinson 
added 
the administration has invited de klerk to visit the united 
states and become the first south african leader on an official 
visit in 30 years

president bushs pledge to fight drugs block by block child by 
child was a popular sound bite on newscasts wednesday but when 
young people on one block were asked if the war on drugs could be 
won most were pessimistic 
its going to take a lot because its not just the students 
its like everybody you know policemen people like that the big 
people said yolanda brown 17 among students interviewed 
wednesday outside tc williams high school in alexandria va 
about bushs speech the night before 
the students skepticism was echoed by many of the rankandfile 
soldiers in the daily battle against drugs narcotics officers 
drug counselors and others who said bushs 79 billion drug program 
was simply not enough 
shane berry 17 another williams student was asked if he agreed 
with bush that people who look the other way when drugs are being 
used are also responsible for the problem 
you couldnt really say that because you cant go telling on 
your friends especially if its just something like pot or 
something he said but crack and cocaine or heroin i would 
tell on my friend because i know that could kill you the first 
time 
in philadelphia allen dobson 21 an admitted former drug 
dealer watched the bush speech with his parents vera and william 
both recovering drug addicts 
i know a lot of people dont want to hear this but its too 
late for a whole generation of us the bottom line is that we have 
wasted lives people from 17 to 25 get the babies and start talking 
to them now 
his mother disagreed noting that she was 35 when she got help 
and has remained drugfree for 22 years 
dobson said he quit selling drugs three years ago and sometimes 
regrets the money and power he lost its hard for me to face the 
fact that im broke 
the chairman of the chicago housing authority vince lane said 
on cbs this morning that the president had taken an important 
step by throwing down the gauntlet 
i was surprised to hear that we did get 50 million allocated 
to public housing with about 30 million here in chicago i can 
clean up every troubled high rise in the city so the money will be 
very much appreciated 
capt mike smith head of the narcotics division in the harris 
county sheriffs department in houston said of the presidents 
speech 
the whole court system is already swamped it would take more 
money than hes talking about unless those people are locked up in 
maximum security theyre not going to quit we keep arresting them 
and all were going is training them in the school of hard knocks 
the campaign that has made smoking socially unacceptable is the 
type needed to turn people against drugs suggested michael 
sylvester a narcotics sergeant with the little rock police 
while law enforcement officials said more money was needed to 
bust drug dealers and keep them behind bars volunteers in treatment 
centers said dollars spent on breaking the addiction would be more 
effective in the long run in solving the drug problem 
the state of oklahoma has no resources to battle drug abuse 
most state programs are primarily to treat alcoholics or marijuana 
we are the only one statewide to treat and rehabilitate drug 
addicts said larry carnes head of the life improvement center in 
oklahoma city 
he said 120 people were in the centers methadone treatment 
program and thats not even the tip of the iceberg its just an 
ice cube our program is 98 percent white we havent even begun to 
impact the black population 
bob halford executive director of the metro atlanta council on 
alcohol and drugs said he was disappointed that bush didnt commit 
more money to treatment and drug education 
i believe we could put all the military all the enforcement 
people in this country and line them up and down the shores and 
i still think people would figure out a way to get drugs into this 
country if they wanted them he said somehow weve got to do 
something from the demand side if we dont get in the mode of 
putting money into prevention programs i think were dead in the 
water

president bush said wednesday that skeptics of 
his 79 billion drug war were just carping and should stop 
criticizing for partisan reasons 
democrats meanwhile said the government would have to raise 
more revenue to mount an allout fight against illegal drugs but 
conceded it would be impossible to enact a tax increase for that 
purpose as long as bush opposes it 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said unless the president supports the tax 
increases that will be necessary to fight this war the drug dealers 
are going to win 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said without the 
administrations support the idea of raising taxes is futile 
bush emphatically rejected the notion of higher taxes every 
time you make a proposal he said you have somebody jump up and 
say raise taxes i am not in a mode to raise taxes 
less than 24 hours after declaring a new war on drugs bush and 
his critics sparred from a distance in speeches on television 
shows and meetings with the press 
putting a human touch on the drug problem bush visited a public 
hospital ward to see babies abandoned by addicted mothers wearing a 
blue smock bush quieted one 4monthold baby boy by cradling him 
against his shoulder 
you see these kids and you want to try harder bush told 
reporters later 
the presidents program emphasizes a crackdown on drug users and 
proposes more money for treatment centers law enforcement and 
prison cells as well as funds to attack drugs at their source in 
colombia peru and bolivia it would require a 716 million increase 
in 1990 above the programs already in the budget 
to meet the increased costs bush proposed diverting money from 
elsewhere in government by abolishing the economic development 
administration and by cutting funds from juvenile justice programs 
public housing and other areas 
asked about democrats criticism that his plan is inadequately 
funded and doesnt go far enough bush said my response is 
theyre wrong 
while digging in his heels against higher taxes bush signaled he 
was openminded about possible changes in his program 
its a good plan he said if people would stop just 
criticizing for partisan reasons and get behind the program and 
then if theres something additional we should do then lets do 
it bush said 
he said his program represented a 2 billion increase above a 
drug program being considered in the house taking aim at his 
critics bush said theyre carping with those partisan 
comments he said 
now if somebody has a real sincere belief that you need more 
in treatment and less in something of course the process will work 
this out 
ive listened carefully bush said at a news conference 
there has been little if any substantive criticism about this 
national strategy 
bush was asked anew about sending american troops to colombia to 
help fight the drug barons there 
he said he did not want to raise the old timeworn specter of 
american military intervention in colombia on the other hand he 
said if troops are requested by president virgilio barco wed 
take a very different look at this 
on capitol hill foley rejected any suggestion that democrats are 
guilty of partisanship 
i dont think the history of this issue has been a partisan 
issue he said 
foley said antidrug bills were enacted with bipartisan support 
in 1986 and 1988 but he also said the administration frustrated 
efforts by democrats to immediately increase antidrug spending 
a democraticcontrolled appropriations panel earlier this year 
sought to boost antidrug spending by 821 million for the current 
fiscal year but the figure was cut to 75 million after the 
administration argued that federal agencies had all the money they 
could spend for now 
foley predicted that congress would add at least the amount the 
president recommended this year and next year i expect we will 
be offering more than the presidents proposal 
bush also snapped at democratic critics during a meeting attended 
by law enforcement officials prosecutors and antidrug 
professionals and by about 30 ambassadors including those from many 
latin american countries 
while apologizing for getting down into the trenches of 
domestic politics with the foreign diplomats present bush said 
i couldnt help but notice that the minute i finished speaking 
there was the predictable response by some that we havent done 
enough 
nobody expected that the members of the united states congress 
particularly from the other party would stamp this 
enthusiastically bush declared 
he also told the ambassadors this really is a war the united 
states cannot fight alone we need to enlist the resources of other 
nations in this battle 
looking directly at colombian ambassador victor mosquera who was 
seated in the front row bush reiterated his decision not to send 
us troops there 
i will not and should not unilaterally impose united states 
troops into another sovereign country and i dont care what the 
emotions are bush said

five space shuttle astronauts said 
wednesday they will feel perfectly safe riding into space next month 
with a planetary payload powered by two nuclear generators 
i have absolutely no qualms about the devices said don 
williams who will command the atlantis mission that is to dispatch 
the galileo spacecraft to orbit jupiter there are some vocal 
groups who feel theres a problem but i feel they are entirely 
safe 
pilot mike mcculley was more blunt i cant imagine how it can 
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head and thats pretty 
remote i think it is a complete nonissue except as a philosophical 
issue to some people 
galileo will be powered by a pair of 122pound radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators rtgs each containing about 24 pounds of 
highly toxic plutonium238 dioxide instruments called thermocouples 
convert the heat released by the plutoniums decay into electricity 
they are the only known devices that can power a spacecraft 
traveling deep into the solar system far from the sun similar rtgs 
provided power to the voyager 2 probe that last month relayed 
stunning photos from neptune 
the united states has launched 22 nuclearpowered spacecraft 
since 1961 with all the plutonium packages encased in superhardened 
material designed to survive the worst possible fire or explosion 
none resulted in the release of radioactive material even though 
one package was aboard a rocket that exploded and two survived 
flaming reentries through earths atmosphere after accidents 
some antinuclear and environmental groups have protested the use 
of plutonium aboard atlantis citing the 1986 space shuttle 
challenger explosion as an example of how things can go wrong they 
contend a similar explosion could result in radioactive 
contamination of the cape canaveral area and a subsequent increase 
in cancer illnesses and death 
because of the nuclear material aboard the white house has to 
approve the mission and a decision is expected within a few days 
the opposing groups have said that if approval is given they 
would seek a court order to block the launch now scheduled for oct 
12 
nasa estimates the odds of another shuttle disaster at somewhere 
between 1in80 and 1in800 
the agency said an exhaustive postchallenger safety review 
indicates the chances of a launch accident in which substantial 
quantities of plutonium pulverized to breathable form could be 
released is about 1in2700 and even then nasa said any 
contamination would be minor 
the five astronauts who will fly the galileo mission were asked 
about the potential danger at a news conference and in individual 
interviews wednesday 
testing shows that they are built to last and withstand about 
anything you can imagine said mission specialist ellen baker 
everyone i love will be at the launch and i feel they will be 
perfectly safe 
she noted that some environmental groups knowledgeable about 
the rtgs have given their seal of approval on this 
nasa and the department of energy have done an excellent job 
with the safeguards said mission specialist shannon lucid 
if the president doesnt sign off on the rtgs i would be very 
disappointed said franklin changdiaz another mission 
specialist we would have taken a step backward in space 
without rtgs we wouldnt have had those wonderful images from 
neptune or other planets and the galileo mission would not be 
possible he said 
once released from atlantis galileo will embark on a sixyear 
journey to jupiter once there it will fire a scientific probe into 
the jovian atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months of 
extensive exploration

critics mounted a lastminute challenge 
wednesday to legislation aimed at assuring the nations 37 million 
disabled the same protections minorities were given a quarter of a 
century ago 
the us chamber of commerce and the national federation of 
independent business spelled out their disagreements with the 
americans with disabilities act in a joint news conference held as 
the senate neared consideration of the measure 
they were pushing for amendments aimed at removing alcohol and 
drug addicts from coverage under the act lowering the penalties for 
violations and exempting the smallest of businesses from lawsuits by 
customers clients and visitors 
students at washingtons gallaudet university for the deaf known 
for an activist spirit that forced a change of its administration 
rallied to support the bill gathering in front of the capitol 
before fanning out to lobby their homestate senators 
the students support provisions requiring phone companies to 
provide telecommunications services for the deaf and at no higher 
cost than regular service 
critics of the act say the cost of compliance including 
modifying movie theaters buses and restaurants to accommodate the 
disabled is beyond estimation 
the act would prevent against job discrimination because of 
handicaps a ban on discrimination in public accommodations 
including buses and restaurants and enforcement through the equal 
employment opportunity commission 
not only alcohol and drug addiction but also affliction with 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome would be considered a 
disability 
the measure had wide sponsorship in the senate and cleared the 
senate labor and human resources committee last month by a unanimous 
vote a house measure has been introduced but has yet to receive 
hearings in any of the four committees that have jurisdiction over 
it 
the white house has also voiced support for the bill saying it 
uses reasonable measures phased in over time 
cosponsor tom harkin diowa speaking to 70 gallaudet 
students likened the position of the disabled to that of blacks and 
women before the landmark civil rights act 
you know before 1964 if you were black or a woman or maybe 
even jewish if you went into a place of business they could throw 
you out or not hire you but today 25 years later it is still 
legal in this country to discriminate on the basis of handicap he 
said 
i king jordan president of the deaf university pointed to 
other landmark legislation from which the disabled are excluded he 
said that the 8 million to 9 million hearing or speechimpaired 
americans have yet to benefit from the fleet interstate telephone 
system created by the communications act of 1934 
at the news conference chamber of commerce attorney nancy fulco 
said the requirement of reasonable access is too vague to be 
defined anywhere but in court 
through its lack of fundamental guidelines and parameters for 
businesses along with its vague language the measure promotes 
lawsuits as a way of handling disputes between employers and the 
disabled she said 
she said it will take the courts 20 years to resolve the 
questions 
this bill as written is a lopsided piece of legislation 
loaded with traps and pitfalls that will be almost unavoidable by 
small businesses said john sloan president of the 
570000member national federation of independent business the 
ada bill would impose costly requirements on businesses and provide 
for unlimited damage awards 
the federation said it could live with the bill if drug and 
alcohol addicts were eliminated from protection the maximum penalty 
for the first violations reduced to 1000 and 5000 instead of 
50000 and 100000 and businesses with 15 or fewer employees were 
exempted from lawsuits by customers visitors and clients alleging 
discrimination under the act

nato plans to propose limits on military 
maneuvers by western and soviet armed forces in europe the first 
time the alliance has suggested nonnuclear military constraints 
nato officials and diplomats said wednesday 
negotiators for the north atlantic treaty organization will 
likely offer detailed plans for restricting military activities 
during the third round of negotiations aimed at reducing nonnuclear 
arms in europe said an alliance official who demanded anonymity 
the talks begin in vienna on thursday 
the discussions between the 16 nato nations and the seven warsaw 
pact countries began in early march to cut troops tanks combat 
aircraft and helicopters and armored personnel carriers the 
bargaining covers an area spanning the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union 
the negotiations are designed to produce a treaty setting equal 
ceilings on nato and warsaw pact tanks artillery armored troop 
carriers aircraft helicopters and possibly manpower 
president bush said in june he wanted to complete the agreement 
within a year but the two alliances have not agreed on a number of 
basic issues including measures to verify how an agreement would be 
kept 
the latest nato proposals mark the first time western countries 
are planning to introduce military constraints said a nato 
official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
major military activities should be cut like maneuvers he 
said 
the proposals would set a threshold limiting the size of these 
exercises to several tens of thousands of soldiers or several 
hundreds of battle tanks he said one maneuver exceeding the limit 
could be held every two years 
also officials were working on details of proposals for 
exchanging information on force structures and verifying compliance 
with a treaty 
in vienna a western diplomat demanding anonymity said some 
tough issues remain to be resolved on verification 
he specifically mentioned divisions between countries like the 
united states and canada which want maximum surveillance and 
european nations which are concerned about constant visits by 
sovietbloc military personnel 
the europeans he explained say i dont want to live with 
soviet inspectors climbing in and out of my bases all the time 
another western diplomat who spoke on condition he not be 
further identified said he expected the verification proposals to 
be presented during the current sixweek session 
the senior nato official said the western nations want to set up 
ways to monitor in detail the arms cuts called for in the treaty 
once the reductions are achieved we want to have 
confirmation by intrusive measures of compliance he said 
he said the allies want regular onsite inspections of places 
where equipment targeted in the treaty would be located each 
participant is liable to receive on its territory an agreed quota of 
such inspections he said 
a separate package of proposals he said would cover the 
exchange of information between the east and west on the command 
structure of their ground and air forces 
it also would give the locations of units singled out for 
reductions storage depots and armored vehicle launched bridges 
nato has proposed both sides be limited to no more than 5700 
combat aircraft and 1900 combat helicopters each no country could 
have more than 3420 combat aircraft and 1140 combat helicopters 
other suggested limits are 20000 tanks 16500 artillery pieces 
and 28000 armored troop carriers for each alliance 
it has also proposed allowing the united states and the soviet 
union to station no more than 275000 troops in europe outside of 
their national territories 
this would amount to a 20 percent cut in us combat troops in 
europe reducing overall us troop strength by about 10 percent 
there are about 150000 us combat troops in europe and more than 
150000 support personnel 
the soviets have an estimated 625000 troops in eastern and 
central europe soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has already offered 
to cut to 350000 and has proposed equal ceilings of nato and warsaw 
pact forces of 135 million

all 47 army generals handed in their 
resignations wednesday to allow the president and army commander 
augusto pinochet to reorganize the high command the government 
said 
the resignations came at the end of a fourhour annual meeting of 
the army qualification board headed by pinochet according to a 
brief statement from the presidential press office 
every year the board meets to decide promotions and new 
assignments within the army high command pinochet makes the final 
decision 
wednesday was the first time all the generals resigned 
they are giving pinochet freedom of action to decide on 
changes the government statement said without elaborating 
press reports in recent days indicated this years army 
reorganization would be more farreaching than in recent years in 
anticipation of the end of 16 years of military rule and the 
generals move from politics to the barracks 
chileans vote dec 14 on a successor to pinochet the new 
president is to take office march 11 
pinochet who seized power in a bloody 1973 military coup was 
forced to call the election after voters in an october national 
referendum rejected a military proposal to extend his rule until 
1997 
patricio aylwin 70 a moderate former senate president and 
candidate of a 17party opposition coalition is widely favored to 
win the election 
government sources say changes in the army will include cutting 
the number of generals from 47 to 38 not including pinochet one 
reason for the reduction is because the army no longer will assign 
senior officers to government posts the sources say 
under the constitution pinochet 73 can remain army commander 
after he steps down from the presidency and he has said he intends 
to do so despite opposition from dissidents and even some of his own 
supporters 
the government did not say when pinochet will announce his 
reshuffle of the high command normally announced in october

an international panel of experts wednesday 
concluded public hearings on the role of multinationals in south 
africa and said they expect to make an extraordinarily tough 
report to the united nations 
canaan banana cochairman of the unappointed panel examining 
the role of multinational corporations in south africa said 
parliamentary elections wednesday would lead to little change in the 
country 
lowell weicker a former us senator and panel member urged the 
united nations to increase pressure on the south african government 
to end its policy of apartheid which denies the black majority a 
voice in national affairs 
the panels report to the united nations will aim for greater 
compliance with internationally agreed upon economic sanctions 
especially regarding withdrawing investment from south africa 
weicker said 
i expect this report to be extraordinarily tough he told a 
press conference 
banana who was the first president of zimbabwe said one of the 
central themes in the report would be the tightening of financial 
sanctions 
this would particularly concern the rescheduling of loans to the 
country he said he refused to give further details 
south africa has a foreign debt of 22 billion according to un 
figures half of this is covered by an agreement with creditor banks 
that is due for renegotiation in 1990 
banana said sanctions are the most effective way of weakening 
south africas economy so that it cannot afford to maintain 
apartheid 
south african and multinational business leaders tuesday said 
further sanctions would hit the black population hardest and 
increase the conservative backlash against change 
the panel heard testimony from groups including the african 
national congress the largest south african guerrilla group and 
the world council of churches which repeated calls for mandatory 
and comprehensive sanctions 
the 11 experts mainly former leading public officials held 
three days of public hearings their report to be published by the 
end of the week will be discussed by the un general assembly in 
new york

it is unrealistic to simply prohibit the owners 
of federally subsidized housing from converting their buildings to 
private rental units or taking them condo a housing consultant told 
a house panel wednesday 
youre just buying yourself a problem if you do that emily 
achtenberg of boston told rep joseph p kennedy ii dmass 
responding to a question from the congressman ms achtenberg 
acknowledged that extension of a twoyear ban on such conversions 
would save money in the shortrange 
in the longrun it is not a solution said ms achtenberg 
who works with nonprofit lowincome tenant groups to help them 
preserve their homes either by buying the buildings themselves or 
working out new rental subsidy agreements 
because of the 1986 tax revisions that removed certain tax breaks 
for rental investment property ms achtenberg said many owners of 
subsidized lowincome rental properties are paying taxes on income 
theyre not actually receiving 
given that situation she said it is not reasonable to expect 
the owners to maintain the lowincome units beyond the time they are 
legally required to do so 
hundreds of thousands of lowincome rental units were constructed 
in the 1960s under a program that provided tax and other financing 
incentives for private developers but also gave them the option to 
pay off their subsidized mortgages after 20 years and making their 
properties private 
many of those 20year arrangements are eligible for conversion 
and ms achtenberg said the logical way for congress to proceed is 
to arrange a graceful exit for owners who want out rather than 
try to keep them in economically unfeasible arrangements 
for one thing she said owners in a moneylosing arrangement 
would not maintain the properties leading to an even worse 
situation in the future 
although the housing and community development subcommittee that 
conducted the hearing is responsible for housing policy legislation 
several members noted that the appropriations committee ultimately 
would have to come up with the money to pay for whatever solution is 
suggested 
kennedy noted that back of the envelope estimates have raised 
the possibility it would cost about 75 billion in federal money to 
reserve for lowincome renters the units facing conversion to the 
private market 
rep bruce f vento dminn asked the panel of advocates for 
lowincome rental groups whether many owners threatening conversion 
might be bluffing in an effort to extract more federal 
assistance 
sara johnson president of the national housing trust said such 
bluffs are not a significant factor because some of the owners 
really are in a losing financial situation because of new tax laws 
and that others are just fed up and want to get out of the 
subsidized housing business

youngsters who are home alone after school for 11 
or more hours a week on a regular basis are twice as likely to abuse 
alcohol tobacco and marijuana as children who arent latchkey 
kids a new report says 
the study analyzing data on almost 5000 eighthgraders in the 
los angeles and san diego areas found that higher risks of 
substance abuse occurred in twoparent as well as singleparent 
households and in affluent as well as poor homes 
the substance abuse showed up regardless of sports and church 
involvment watching television after school or spending time with 
friends said the study published in this months issue of 
pediatrics the journal of the american academy of pediatrics based 
in suburban elk grove village 
adolescents who turn to alcohol cigarettes and marijuana may be 
manifesting a desire to display their sense of maturity and 
independence said the study led by jean richardson of the 
university of southern california school of medicine in los angeles 
she and her colleagues suggested that the relationship between 
selfcare and substance abuse may be partly due to the tendency to 
take risks that can result from being alone having friends who 
smoke or being in situations where cigarettes are offered 
lillian m beard a washington dc pediatrician said in a 
telephone interview wednesday that the findings were not surprising 
because young people whose energies are not directed 
particularly during early adolescence are at greater risk for not 
only substance abuse but all kinds of risktaking behavior 
including truancy shoplifting and even joinging gangs 
loraine stern a los angelesarea pediatrician and a member of 
the academys communications committee said there is something 
intangible especially during the adolescent years about having an 
anchor 
and theres no doubt in my mind from experience and 
philosophically that latchkey children are at greater risk not only 
for substance abuse but for emotional difficulties she said in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
the studys findings support several recent articles that suggest 
some types of problem behavior among early adolescents can be 
linked at least partly to large amounts of time spent without 
adult supervision particularly after school the authors said 
researchers collected data by questionnaires given to 4932 
youngsters in 47 public schools and validated the findings with 
data from 2185 parents of the youngsters all data were collected 
in february 1987 
the researchers found that students in selfcare for 11 or more 
hours per week after school were twice as likely to have consumed a 
high level of alcohol 21 times more likely to have a high 
cigarette consumption and 17 times more likely to have smoked 
marijuana than children who had adult supervision 
high alcohol consumption was defined as 11 or more drinks in 
ones life and high cigarette consumption was defined as one or 
more packs smoked 
the researchers said the number of us latchkey children now 
estimated at 2 million to 6 million is likely to rise due to the 
increase in the number of dualcareer and singleparent families and 
the decrease in traditional extended family arrangements 
they suggested developing more alternatives to selfcare 
including afterschool programs at schools libraries recreation 
centers churches or other locations

after president bush announced a 79 billion plan to fight drug 
sales and use 
the united states has already given military hardware to the 
government of colombia center of the world cocaine trade to help

drug production 
without referring directly to bushs proposals perfiliev 
expressed soviet backing for us and colombian efforts to fight the 
drug business 
however its impossible not to note that there are attempts to 
send american armed forces to that country he said such an

president reagan directed his national security 
adviser john poindexter to give responses to congressional 
inquiries that led to poindexters indictment in the irancontra 
scandal poindexters lawyers said wednesday 
at a court hearing frederick robinson said prosecutors should be 
ordered to request reagans notes of various meetings so that they 
can be turned over as part of poindexters defense 
notes from thenvice president george bush should be turned over 
for poindexters review robinson said as well as notes from former 
white house chief of staff don regan and thendefense secretary 
caspar weinberger 
poindexters lawyers assert that all of poindexters actions were 
approved by higherups in the reagan administration and that a lot 
of people took notes robinson told us district judge harold 
greene 
he said the defense needs those notes so that we can test 
their credibility if the notes authors are called as witnesses at 
poindexters trial 
robinson referred to numerous statements by bush and others that 
the thenvice president wasnt present at key cabinetlevel meetings 
in the irancontra affair but any time he missed a meeting 
admiral poindexter briefed him afterwards poindexters lawyer 
said of bush 
robinson focused on what he said was a meeting in mid1986 
between reagan and poindexter it related to questions from house 
committees asking whether the administration was assisting the 
nicaraguan contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the 
rebel force 
one of the charges against poindexter is that he obstructed 
congress in sending responses to congress in july 1986 that referred 
to letters sent a year earlier by his predecessor robert mcfarlane 
mcfarlanes letters denied that north and the national security 
council staff were supplying military advice or raising funds for 
the rebel force 
mcfarlane subsequently pleaded guilty to withholding statements 
from congress in connection with the letters 
the indictment against poindexter says he well knew and 
believed mcfarlanes 1985 letters were false 
poindexter went to the president to talk about the 
congressional responses robinson told the judge 
greene asked robinson whether he was suggesting that the 
president said you go ahead and do this 
yes said robinson the lawyer asserted that reagan said in 
effect i want these things done 
i think that the presidents notes will show his 
discussions about the letters that were sent to congress and the 
appropriateness of any response robinson added he said the 
meeting would show presidential approval and ratification of that 
activity 
poindexter wants the judge to direct the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh to request some of reagans notes so that 
they can be turned over to the former national security adviser 
christian mixter a lawyer for the prosecution in the poindexter 
case noted that in the irancontra criminal case against oliver 
north we were quite willing to make requests of the president 
ourselves to obtain typewritten excerpts of reagans diaries 
but mixter noted that was a case of voluntary compliance and 
that when norths lawyers subpoenaed reagan the justice department 
asked to be heard on the question of executive privilege us 
district court judge gerhard gesell quashed the subpoena for reagan 
at the north trial 
i believe the independent counsel is not obligated to provide 
materials from the former president said mixter 
poindexters lawyer responded that white house lawyers have 
directed us back to the independent counsel on requests for 
documents from the reagan administration 
poindexter is charged in the irancontra scandal with conspiracy 
two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements

south floridas post offices will no longer accept 
100 bills because 93 fake ones were unwittingly accepted by miami 
postal workers in three days last week 
in the oneyear period just before this only 120 counterfeit 
bills of all denominations were passed at the postal offices said 
karen schultz spokeswoman for the miami division of the postal 
service 
most of the phony bills were used to buy money orders and 
officials suspect one person is responsible so far no other post 
office in the division has been hit by the counterfeiter schultz 
said 
last year 19 million worth of counterfeit bills were passed in 
the miami area said secret service special agent allan cramer that 
puts miami ahead of 18 million passed in new york and 14 million 
in los angeles 
the miami division of the postal service is considering buying 
counterfeit detectors for its 155 offices in broward palm beach 
dade monroe lee hendry and collier counties said schultz 
the detector machine which costs 200 to 1000 works on the 
premise that an educated user will be able to see the magnetic or 
fiber contents of genuine bills said paul hackenberry assistant 
special agent in charge of the secret services miami office 
but expert counterfeiters can fool the machine and its user he 
said 
we do believe these bills were manufactured outside the united 
states hackenberry said the person was passing those bills by 
using them at the post office if counterfeiters go somewhere and 
have a successful pass they continue going to a place like it

now that congress has passed the savings and 
loan rescue it should consider changes in deposit insurance 
including a reduction in the 100000 coverage limit the chairman 
of the house banking committee says 
i believe it wouldnt hurt any to reduce it a few thousand 
dollars i think itll make the stockholders and the depositors a 
little bit more careful about what theyre doing with their 
institution said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
the sampl bill signed into law aug 9 by president bush directs 
the treasury department to finish a study of the deposit insurance 
issue in 18 months but gonzalez says action may be needed sooner 
theyve had studies galore the pressure on the deposit 
insurance fund continues he said in an interview tuesday 
the sampl legislation provided taxpayer dollars to rescue failed 
thrift institutions and shored up the commercial bank fund by nearly 
doubling insurance premiums charged to banks but gonzalez said the 
system is still vulnerable to unexpected but not unforeseen 
events such as a dramatic deterioration of heavily indebted 
corporations or third world countries 
gonzalez said he wants to hear testimony on the issue before 
making up his mind but said he currently favors reducing the maximum 
insurance coverage from 100000 and limiting the number of insured 
accounts per depositor 
however proponents of the current system argue that it has 
successfully prevented a recurrence of the wave of bank failures 
that struck the nation in the depression 
and they argue that reducing deposit insurance would favor large 
banks over small ones depositors would shift their money to big 
institutions believing regulators would not close a big bank for 
fear of the shock of a large failure to the financial system they 
say 
gonzalez said he also favors examining uninsured money market 
mutual funds which he called the loose cannon of the financial 
system 
it is a source of worry he said ill guarantee you that 
nine out of 10 people that have their money in those mutual money 
markets uninsured dont know that theyre not insured that 
has to be looked at 
commercial banks hold about 24 trillion in deposits followed 
by sampls with 960 billion money market mutual funds with 330 
billion and credit unions with 195 billion all except mutual funds 
are federally insured 
part of deposit insurance reform will be a look at banks use of 
their deposits including investing in leveraged corporate buyouts 
and in securities underwriting gonzalez said 
any attempt to reform federal deposit insurance is sure to spark 
fierce debate in congress in january just before president reagan 
left office white house economic advisers suggested that deposit 
insurance ought to be curbed 
but even that vague recommendation provoked strong criticism from 
members of congress including gonzalez although he didnt reject 
reducing deposit insurance then he chastised the timing of reagan 
advisers who floated the idea at the height of depositor concern 
over sampls 
in recent weeks the topic has been raised in banking circles 
more frequently william isaac former chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp lee hoskins president of the federal 
reserve bank in cleveland and john s reed chairman of citicorp 
the nations largest bank company have all outlined proposals for 
forcing large depositors to assume some losses in a bank failure 
meanwhile rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the banking 
committees financial institutions subcommittee has scheduled 
hearings sept 1921 to examine the health of the insurance funds 
for commercial banks and credit unions

national drug policy director william j 
bennett predicted wednesday that the war on drugs outlined by 
president bush will win passage in congress and then succeed against 
illegal drugs in america 
there will be no batman through the transom flashy solutions 
to the drug problem bennett said but he added if we follow this 
strategy pursue and apply this pressure consistently over time and 
if we do our job and the states do their job and others who are 
called on do their job this problem will get better and america 
will win this war on drugs 
bennett launching his campaign to sell the 79 billion program 
to congress and the country expressed confidence that the american 
people are ready for what he called this just war 
most americans understand what this problem is they are 
impatient about it and they want something to be done he said 
as for winning congressional approval he said he was heartened 
that much criticism so far from democrats has concerned money to pay 
for the proposal not the basic tenets 
the strategy which bennett played a key role in developing 
calls for a law enforcement crackdown on all levels of drug 
trafficking from drug kingpins overseas to casual users in america 
it also seeks a 53 percent increase in funding for treatment 
programs a 25 percent increase in prevention efforts and a vast 
expansion of the federal prison system to house drug offenders 
a number of congressional democrats have said the program doesnt 
go far enough and that bush should recommend a tax increase to pay 
for it instead of proposing to take money from other programs 
i did not hear anyone taking issue in principle with an andean 
strategy with the strategy which talks about user responsibility 
with the strategy that talks about our efforts in public housing 
that talks about accountability in treatment that talks about 
measurable objectives and the like bennett said 
the andean strategy calls for 261 million to be spent next year 
in military and law enforcement antidrug aid to colombia peru and 
bolivia the three main cocaineproducing countries in addition 
the administration plans to offer some 2 billion more over the five 
following years to those countries in economic and other aid once 
they demonstrate solid efforts to cut down on the drug trafficking 
as for those who say the 79 billion is inadequate to fight the 
war on drugs bennett said im just not going to be all that 
receptive to criticism of the figure of 8 billion from people whose 
correct mark is 6 billion 
the criticism wasnt only coming from congress however 
the american civil liberties union called the bush 
administrations antidrug strategy counterproductive and 
cynical shortchanging prevention and treatment programs while 
putting overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice system 
the plan will compromise civil liberties and cost the taxpayers 
millions of dollars said ira glasser aclus executive director 
neal r sonnett president of the national association of 
criminal defense lawyers said the administrations plan dooms us 
to repeat the failures of the past the nation needs to find 
better ways to divert firsttime and nonviolent minor offenders 
into treatment rehabilitation and education programs sonnett 
said 
and donald fiedler national director of the national 
organization for the reform of marijuana laws said the program 
declares war on at least 25 million fellow citizens who are 
leading productive lives but for their casual or regular use of 
marijuana 
bennett defended the strategys emphasis on punishing casual 
users including requiring colleges to take action against them if 
they want to continue receiving federal funds 
it is not to be mean and vindictive bennett said the user 
is the person who is the carrier casual users give out drugs 
because they like company in what theyre doing 
although bush rejected bennetts plan to require states to impose 
strict punishment on casual users including the revocation of 
drivers licenses and seizures of autos used to obtain drugs if 
the states wanted to receive federal highway funds bennett 
continued to press states to pass such laws 
casual users may not need to go to prison he said but theres 
a lot of things people can do as a way of making restitution to 
the community they can pay fines they can give up their property 
if its used for their crime they can do community service they 
can fill potholes 
on other issues bennett said 
those who criticize the plans call for increased security at 
public housing projects such as identification cards and the 
eviction of drug dealers are failing to see that poor people 
should have the same safety enjoyed by the wealthy 
more research is needed in drug treatment to develop methods to 
get people off cocaine the simple fact is that crack cocaine 
has caught on as an addiction and as a criminal activity ahead of 
the researchers and the legitimate research community needs to 
catch up

an 80yearold man fighting deportation over 
accusations he committed nazi atrocities has a constitutional right 
to refuse to answer questions about his wartime activities in 
latvia a federal judge has ruled 
the fear of edgars inde are reasonable that he will be prosecuted 
for war crimes if his us citizenship is revoked and he is 
deported us district judge paul magnuson said tuesday 
the ruling means inde may invoke his fifth amendment right in the 
civil proceeding against him instituted in a lawsuit for deportation 
by the us justice department in 1988 
the minneapolis man is accused of belonging to a political police 
organization that helped nazi ss troops execute thousands of latvian 
jews in 1941 the government sued inde on grounds that he lied about 
his wartime activities when he applied for entry into the united 
states following the war 
inde has denied that he was involved in the execution of jews 
the united states does not prosecute war criminals but some 
countries including israel the soviet union and west germany have 
done so 
indes attorney ivars berzins of babylon ny told magnuson 
at a hearing in may that inde fears he will be deported to one of 
those three countries and prosecuted for war crimes 
this is a civil proceeding in name only berzins said our 
client stands accused of nothing less than murder he has a real 
fear of foreign prosecution 
magnuson said in his order that indes fear is not trifling or 
imaginary in view of the nature of the charges it is reasonable to 
assume that the only country willing to accept him in the event of 
deportation would be one that would prosecute him 
berzins reached at his office by telephone wednesday declined 
to comment on the ruling and refused to say what the next step in 
the proceedings would be 
telephone messages for comment from alan held attorney for the 
us justice department were not immediately returned 
the justice department had argued that inde may decline to answer 
questions only if he fears prosecution in the united states the 
department also contends it is unlikely any other country would 
prosecute inde for war crimes 
magnusons order overturns one issued in may by us magistrate 
floyd boline boline said that fear of foreign prosecution is not a 
basis for claiming privilege against selfincrimination and that any 
statements made by inde in a deposition could be sealed to protect 
him from foreign prosecution 
magnuson said sealing the transcript might not adequately protect 
inde

the us ambassador and his last 29 
american staff members were forced out of lebanon on wednesday by 
christians including about 1000 massed outside the embassy who 
claim the united states supports syria 
two helicopters landed at the compound about 730 am and a 
third hovered overhead apparently providing cover while the 30 
americans were evacuated a witness said 
it is the first time an american ambassador has been pulled from 
lebanon since the sectarian civil war began 14 years ago and the 
move at least temporarily ended the american diplomatic presence in 
the country 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler angrily blamed the 
christian army commander gen michel aoun for the move saying he 
threatened to expose us ambassador john mccarthy and his staff to 
a good dose of christian terrorism 
she said that before the evacuation an unidentified telephone 
caller had threatened to shoot down the us helicopter that brought 
supplies to the embassy and that an unidentified protest leader said 
people in the embassy entered and left at their own risk 
the americans will return when conditions permit ms 
tutwiler said 
on arrival at the us militarys rhinemain air base outside 
frankfurt a weary mccarthy told reporters wednesday night that as 
soon as those questions of security and safety can be resolved 
it would be important for us to resume the work that we were doing 
in beirut 
mccarthy and his staff flew in on a us air force c130 
transport plane from cyprus they are expected to leave west germany 
for the united states on thursday but no further details were 
immediately available 
it just seemed to me that in the last several days it was no 
longer possible for me to guarantee to washington that the safety of 
my staff was secure and it was for that reason that we left 
mccarthy said 
but as soon as those questions of security and safety can be 
resolved it seems to be that it would be important for us to resume 
the work that we were doing in beirut 
in christian east beirut youths who had blockaded the gates of 
the embassy compound for 24 hours dispersed at 1 pm 
the movement for supporting liberation threatened in a statement 
to resume the embassy siege if mccarthy returned before washington 
recognized aouns christian cabinet as the legitimate lebanese 
government 
aoun who has fought an artillery war with syrian troops six 
months said of the evacuation it seems the american cain 
couldnt endure the stare of the lebanese abel so he left 
aoun accuses the united states of supporting the presence of 
40000 soldiers in lebanon which he calls an occupation army the 
syrians are in the country under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate 
syrians and christians exchanged intermittent artillery fire in 
and around beirut on wednesday killing one person and wounding 
three 
by police count 828 people have been killed and 2455 wounded 
since the fighting began march 8 between the 20000 men of aouns 
christian army units and a moslem alliance led by the syrians 
mccarthy arrived a year ago but to avoid extending recognition 
to either aouns government or the competing moslem cabinet of 
acting premier salim hoss he did not present his credentials 
in aouns statement issued in english the ustrained general 
said i am not surprised at all by the apparently precipitate 
departure of our american guests early this morning 
i used the term guests since as the american ambassador did 
not see fit to present his credentials to my government his status 
and that of his officials was strictly speaking that of visitors 
such puzzling and petulant behavior by mr mccarthy merely 
reflects the nature and conduct of the us state departments 
policy toward that part of lebanon free of syrian occupation 
annahar an independent beirut newspaper said an undisclosed 
number of american diplomats left beirut on saturday after aoun told 
a news conference the united states had sold lebanon to syria 
he claimed us policy was dictated exclusively by concerns 
over the eight remaining american hostages in lebanon 
the eight are among 16 western captives most believed to be in 
the hands of shiite radicals loyal to iran held longest is terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
a resident of aoukar the christian suburb where the embassy is 
located said two helicopters landed at the embassy compound 
around 730 am while the third which appeared to be armed with 
machine guns hovered overhead at a medium altitude in an apparent 
protection mission 
several people boarded the helicopters seconds after they 
landed they also loaded big sacks and several bags on the aircraft 
which took off a few minutes later 
keith peterson spokesman for the us embassy in cyprus said 
this move was in response to deteriorating local circumstances 
which no longer permitted the embassy to function effectively the 
united states is not abandoning lebanon its personnel will 
return when the situation permits 
american diplomats moved to the beirut facility an embassy 
annex after a shiite moslem suicide bomber rammed a van packed with 
explosives into the seaside embassy in moslem west beirut on april 
19 1983 killing 17 americans and 46 other people 
a suicide bomber attacked the east beirut annex on sept 20 
1984 killing 12 people and wounding 96 but the embassy remained

cocaine prices in miami rose in the past few 
weeks but its still unclear whether the colombian governments 
crackdown on narcotics traffickers slowed the flow of the drug into 
the united states the drug enforcement administration said 
wednesday 
the retail price of cocaine in south florida has gone from an 
average of 11000 to 16000 per kilogram to about 19000 to 
20000 based on sales of five to 15 kilograms dea spokesman frank 
shults said 
the dea was not aware of any change in price to individual 
cocaine users as agents did not make any such spot check purchases 
shults said instead they bought in quantities of five 10 and 15 
kilograms he said 
the increase in prices shults cautioned has been noticed for 
the past three weeks since slightly before colombian president 
virgilio barco issued emergency measures that allow for the 
extradition of alleged drug traffickers to the united states to 
stand trial and for the seizure of the traffickers property 
barco launched the nationwide attack on drug traffickers 
following the aug 18 assassination of leading president candidate 
luis carlos galan a foe of the drug trade 
we have not made any judgment about the impact of the events in 
colombia about the availability of cocaine in the united states 
shults said the dea is reviewing intelligence trends and various 
other indicators and well be making that assessment he said 
however shults said that even if cocaine is not becoming scarcer 
because of a disruption in the drug traffickers operations some 
retailers who are raising their prices may be capitalizing on 
buyers fears that the drug is becoming harder to obtain 
it may just be individual entrepreneurs capitalizing on 
perceived market pressures he said 
since barco announced the emergency measures drug traffickers 
have launched a total war on the government including bombings 
in medellin home to one of the worlds largest drug cartels and 
in the capital city of bogota and a shooting spree at the bogota 
airport 
while the raw material coca leaf for most of the us supply 
of cocaine is grown in peru and bolivia colombia is the base for 
the major traffickers who process the leaf into cocaine and 
distribute it overseas

the new government the state pap news agency reported wednesday 
the full list of nominees to the first noncommunistled 
government in the east bloc will be made public thursday a 
secretary in mazowieckis office said 
a brief pap dispatch said mazowiecki received kiszczak at his 
office wednesday and offered him a position but did not say what 
position or if kiszczak accepted 
an army general who for eight years headed the interior ministry 
with control of the police kiszczak would appear a likely candidate 
to head either the interior ministry or the ministry of defense 
two communist party leaders also met with mazowiecki on wednesday 
and said a good atmosphere prevailed but certain details remain 
unsettled and require more talks thursday according to pap 
the party politburo was reviewing the proposed government makeup 
and will inform mazowiecki on thursday of its final stance on taking 
part in the coalition pap said 
longtime solidarity activist mazowiecki was elected prime 
minister on aug 24 he has crafted a coalition cabinet giving the 
largest share of ministerial portfolios to members of his movement 
followed by the communist polish united workers party the united 
peasant party and the democratic party according to legislative

azerbaijanis will continue a general strike 
originally called for three days until a top soviet official visits 
the area a leading activist in baku said wednesday 
ekhtibar mamedov spokesman for the peoples front political 
movement said by telephone from the southern republics capital 
that hundreds of thousands of people attended a rally late wednesday 
the peoples front wants azerbaijan to reassert full control over 
the nagornokarabakh region which now is being governed from 
moscow and to recall its national parliament representatives 
neighboring armenia also claims nagornokarabakh whose 
population is predominantly armenian and violence has torn the 
region for 18 months 
mamedov said the strike scheduled to end wednesday would 
continue until president mikhail s gorbachev vice president 
anatoly i lukyanov or premier nikolai i ryzhkov visit the area 
he said the peoples front wants such a visit because the 
republics government is not in a position to solve this question 
of nagornokarabakh if noone comes mamedov declared the 
political movement may change its platform to call for independence 
rather than greater autonomy 
abdulrakhman vezirov head of the republics communist party 
recommended more complete kremlin control over nagornokarabakh 
region 
vezirov made the statement in an interview released in moscow by 
the foreign ministry it contradicted a claim made by activist aiden 
amirbekov late tuesday that vezirov wanted control returned to 
azerbaijan 
official media have given wide coverage to ethnic disputes in the 
baltic republics and in moldavia which borders romania but have 
said little about the strike in azerbaijan 
the peoples front says the strike has affected 95 percent of 
factories in baku and paralyzed rail transportation throughout the 
republic journalists for the official azerinform news agency have 
said the strike is not so widespread 
tass the official soviet news agency said a strike by 
russianspeaking workers in moldavia against a law making moldavian 
the official language continued despite appeals by the local 
leadership and a national commission 
strikers met with a national legislative commission and the 
moldavian party chief president and premier tass said 
the strikers want russian as a second official language in the 
republic of the republics 42 million people 64 percent are 
ethnic moldavian and 36 percent ukrainian russian bulgarian

american investors have been cheated out of at 
least 2 billion a year by crooked schemes involving low cost high 
risk penny stocks according to a survey by state securities 
regulators on wednesday 
penny stock swindles are now the no 1 threat of fraud and 
abuse facing small investors in the united states said the report 
on a 50state survey by the north american securities administrators 
association nasaa 
the report comes just as congress turns to examine the problem 
the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee has 
scheduled a hearing thursday on the effect of penny stock swindles 
on small investors 
the likelihood of losing money in penny stocks now runs at 
about 90 percent said rep edward j markey dmass the 
subcommittee chairman penny stocks make a night at the casino 
look like a shrewd investment he added 
markeys subcommittee was scheduled to hear testimony from a 
convicted penny stock swindler with alleged organized crimes ties a 
powder springs ga couple who were victimized by penny stock scam 
artists and john baldwin director of the utah division of 
securities and president of nasaa a washingtonbased organization 
of statelevel securities regulators 
penny stocks inexpensive but highly risky securities that 
usually arent listed on stock exchanges are legal but they are 
usually issued by new companies with an untested or uneven earnings 
history 
while their price a few cents up to a few dollars makes them an 
attractive to small investors with limited funds they pose a risk 
because information is often hard to obtain and fraudulent claims 
are difficult to dispute 
the penny stock industry increasingly is dominated by utterly 
worthless or highly dubious securities offerings that are 
systematically manipulated by repeat offenders of state and federal 
securities laws the nasaa report said 
the report went on to note that investors in legitimate penny 
stocks are believed to lose all or some of their investment 70 
percent of the time and the presence of fraud pushes up that figure 
to 90 percent 
while penny stock fraud is not new the report noted it has 
grown from the the phony mining stock scams of the 1940s and 1950s 
that were confined mainly to the far west to widespread interstate 
schemes 
in florida only 5 percent of the registered brokers specialize 
in penny stocks but they accounted for 40 percent of investor 
complaints in fiscal year 19881989 
according to the 50state survey nasaa conducted 
pending statelevel probes of penny stock schemes rose 97 
percent from 1987 to 1988 from 375 to 737 
the number of investigations into penny stocks that state 
regulators have concluded jumped from 262 in 1987 to 395 in 1988 
consumer complaints about penny stocks have risen from 1767 in 
1987 to 2660 in 1988 
several states have indicated that their offices have been 
swamped so far in 1989 with new penny stock investor complaints 
according to the 98page report 
the surge in investor complaints has been echoed in securities 
and exchange commission statistics the federal agency which 
oversees the markets in stocks bonds and other securities said it 
received 1510 penny stock complaints in all of fiscal year 1988 and 
has already gotten 2462 in the first half of this year

otto g obermaier a manhattan defense lawyer 
who specializes in whitecollar cases was nominated wednesday to 
succeed rudolph giuliani as us attorney for the southern district 
of new york 
president bush announced his nomination of obermaier in a news 
release obermaier said he was delighted to be nominated 
giuliani stepped down jan 31 to run for the republican 
nomination for mayor of new york since then benito romano has been 
the acting us attorney 
obermaier 53 was recommended for the job in january by sen 
alfonse damato rny over the objections of giuliani 
giuliani opposed obermaier because several of his firms clients 
are targets of federal insidertrading investigations giuliani said 
he would present his views to the justice department which reviews 
a candidate for a federal prosecutors job before the president 
sends the nomination to the senate for its approval 
on wednesday spokesman charles perkins said giuliani wishes 
him well in the confirmation process and believes hes qualified 
for the position 
shortly after his nomination obermaier said he did not think 
that his work as a defense lawyer would create conflicts for him as 
a federal prosecutor he said he would step aside if as us 
attorney he encountered a case in which his firm had a role 
i dont think theyre all that numerous but clearly im 
ethically obligated to do that he said 
obermaier was quoted in the national law journal in 1987 as 
saying securities violations were being handled too often by 
prosecutors as crimes rather than by the securities and exchange 
commission as civil matters 
on wednesday he said that his comments certainly represented 
the thinking at the time he said he could not name any recent 
wall street cases that he believed had been wrongly prosecuted 
as us attorney giuliani was at the forefront of investigating 
wall street scandals prosecuting numerous cases of insider trading 
and stock manipulation

years in the latest episode of a corruption scandal that led to the 
kremlin

premier from 197184 guilty of taking more than 15000 rubles in 
bribes and giving bribes of 50000 rubles the ruble figures are 
equivalent to 23000 and 80000 at the official rate of exchange 
several regional party officials in uzbekistan have been executed 
for corruption since trials began last year

enveloped the uzbekistan government and communist party that 
officials had to participate in order to live and work more or 
less normally

by uncovering the trail of corruption that led from uzbekistan to 
brezhnevs kremlin where churbanov was first deputy interior 
minister 
after both were elected to the new parliament this year however 
their tactics came under criticism and they were taken off the case 
tass said supporters of gdlyan and ivanov attended 
khudaiberdievs trial and the judge had to caution them to stop 
interfering

premier ruud lubbers christian 
democrats won wednesdays national election giving lubbers a third 
term in office and a mandate to strengthen environmental cleanup 
laws 
with 92 percent of the vote counted dutch television projected 
that lubbers middleoftheroad christian democratic appeal would 
keep its 54 seats in the 150seat dutch parliament and remain the 
largest single group in the legislature 
the largest parliamentary party traditionally gets the 
premiership in the dutch system the results showed voters rallied 
behind ludders the longestserving dutch leader in 30 years 
the television projection said the rightwing liberals junior 
partners in the centerright coalition government would lose five 
of their 27 seats and indicated a loss of three of its 52 seats for 
the labor party 
the liberal loss combined with longstanding tensions within the 
coalition could open the way to a centerleft alliance with labor 
getting its first share of power after seven years in opposition 
lubbers centerright coalition government crumbled in may over 
environmental policy in a clash that also reflected years of 
irritation among the liberals at having to accept christian 
democratic programs 
the christian democrats form the fulcrum of power in dutch 
politics and traditionally join forces with either labor or the 
liberals 
lubbers said the liberals loss was tough very tough for his 
former coalition partners but did not rule out entering a new 
alliance with them 
however lubbers also said in the television interview that 
theres no reason why he might not build a coalition with labor 
most electoral gains went to the opposition democrats 66 party 
which steers close to labor and green left an upstart alliance of 
environmentalists and antinato activists that includes the 
communist party of the netherlands both parties picked up three 
seats giving 12 seats to the democrats 66 and six for the green 
left 
queen beatrix now will appoint an official to supervise the 
building of a new coalition and getting it to agree on a government 
platform and the division of ministerial posts 
the chrstian democrats parliamentary floor leader bert de 
vries said in a television interview it would be a pretty 
complicated business for his party to agree on a new centerright 
alliance with the liberals 
the highly popular lubbers came to power in 1982 on a platform of 
economic recovery focused on bringing down the nations budget 
deficit then at 10 percent of net national income and its 17 
percent unemployment rate 
the budget deficit is expected to be down to 525 percent next 
year with 610000 people or 113 percent of the working 
population still unemployed 
but as economic prospects looked up lubbers turned to the 
environment and fielded an ambitious 33 billion plan to clean up 
the heavily polluted dutch soil air and waterways 
the plan sparked his governments fall when the liberals rejected 
lubbers proposal to partly finance it by ending income tax breaks 
for the nations cardriving commuters 
if the christian democrats and labor form a new cabinet that 
could herald a substantial easing of the austere economic programs 
that earned lubbers his media nickname rude shock 
labor has been accusing lubbers of unfairly burdening lowincome 
groups like the 3 million people living on subsistencelevel social 
benefits as well as the sick and elderly

east german diplomats set up office near 
a refugee camp wednesday to try to persuade thousands of their 
countrymen they had nothing to fear at home and to give up dreams of 
a new life in the west 
west germany meanwhile expressed hope a solution to the refugee 
crisis was near 
by late wednesday about 5600 east germans hoping to flee west 
had registered to do so said officials of west german charities who 
have helped to care for the refugees since midaugust hungarian 
charity officials said a sixth refugee camp had been opened with 
more planned if needed 
thirty east germans apparently frustrated at waiting for a 
promised freedom convoy from hungary to the west fled illegally 
tuesday night to austria red cross officials there said 
the number going over the border zoomed in recent days 
indicating refugee desperation over recent discouraging hungarian 
statements hinting that the start of an organized mass exodus could 
be weeks away 
hungary has partially cleared the border of barbed wire and other 
barriers 
west german officials had seemed optimistic last week that mass 
transit westward could begin in days they now are more cautious 
but several suggested that a move west still was not too far away 
for the east germans 
the official mti news agency quoted west german ambassador 
alexander arnot as saying the refugee situation will be resolved 
in the forseeable future 
in bonn where west german officials have been negotiating with 
hardline communist east german leaders over the refugee standoff 
government speaker hans klein said east germany showed no 
flexibility 
but foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said bonn remains 
confident of a solution soon 
hungary has angered east germany its soviet bloc ally by 
effectively breaking an agreement obliging it to return all east 
germans trying to flee 
it has also pledged they would be allowed to leave for west 
germany which grants them automatic citizenship but budapests 
communist leaders are thought to be seeking at least grudging east 
german acquiescence before giving the goahead for the mass exodus 
few young working east germans can travel to the west legally 
but are relatively free to go to hungary more than 6000 east 
germans have fled through austria to west germany since hungary 
began clearing its westernmost border in may 
east berlin promised refugees they face no persecution if they 
return 
first secretary dieter grahmann of the east german embassy on 
tuesday began distributing leaflets at the zugliget refugee camp 
repeating his countrys promises but left quickly after an angry 
crowd gathered he returned wednesday and set up with a colleague 
in a car trailer across from the camp 
around them were cars of east german refugees some with bumper 
stickers of a european cigarette company declaring lets go 
west or of a west german charter airline saying nothing like 
getting out of here 
small groups gathered near the trailer shortly after it was 
manned at 945 am but no one approached and several wouldbe 
refugees were openly derisive 
they must really be stupid to come here said a heavyset 
east german from dresden but i guess they have no choice its 
either victory or siberia for them 
grahmann told reporters any refugees were free to discuss the 
situation with him or a colleague 
but several east germans said after the trailer closed for the 
day at noon that the two diplomats had had little to do 
i didnt see one person going in there outside of western 
journalists said the dresden man who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the east german embassy said the trailer would reopen 
thursday 
hungarian charity official csilla von boeselager said camp 
residents were asked to refrain from unwise actions against 
diplomats or trailer 
hungarian red cross officials at nearby csilleberc camp said an 
east german diplomat carrying leaflets was barred entry because 
it would have been difficult to guarantee the safety of said east 
german mti reported

britain should take a hard look at its 
financial links with south africa as part of international efforts 
to end apartheid canadian foreign minister joe clark said wednesday 
britains financial ties with south africa are of special 
importance said clark who indicated at a london news conference 
that britains 47 commonwealth partners will exert pressure over the 
links at a meeting next month 
clark spoke as thousands of blacks struck in south africa to 
protest their exclusion from voting in wednesdays national 
election before the poll president fw clerk of the governing 
national party pledged reforms to give blacks a role in government 
if south african loans were rescheduled for say only one year 
at a time that would enable us to see how much progress is made in 
the reform program we feel that loan pressure can be an effective 
instrument in helping the reform program clark said 
talk of reform in south africa is not in itself enough there 
must be clear evidence that a reform program is being implemented 
he said 
clark met earlier with britains foreign secretary john major to 
explain the decisions of the commonwealth foreign ministers 
committee last month in canberra australia britain is not a member 
of the committee 
clark said the british position on sanctions has been clear 
from the beginning they believe sanctions are not effective in the 
fight against apartheid in my view britain is as committed as 
anyone else to the ending of apartheid 
we hope that we may persuade the british government to take a 
hard look at the financial links with south africa and the role of 
south africa in loan negotiations he said 
prime minister margaret thatcher will meet with other leaders of 
the commonwealth of britain and its former colonies in kuala lumpur 
malaysia on oct 1824 the meeting is expected to assess the 
prospects for reform in south africa following the general election 
britain is the biggest foreign investor in south africa 
the antiapartheid movement in london estimates total direct and 
indirect investment in south africa by british companies at about 
1024 billion down from 126 billion in 1987 britain is south 
africas thirdlargest trading partner behind japan and west germany 
more than 200 british companies have subsidiaries in south africa 
and the 120 largest employ 230000 people 
the largest of the british companies is consolidated gold fields 
plc with a 38 percent stake in gold fields of south africa which 
mines gold and coal and employs 102000 people 
mrs thatcher has said mandatory economic sanctions would hurt 
the black population and neighboring black states more than the 
governing white minority 
later a rally by about 180 antiapartheid demonstrators in 
trafalgar square near the south african embassy turned violent 
when some tried to sit in the road scotland yard said 
a spokesman refusing to be named said the problems began after 
about half the demonstrators broke away from the evening rally to 
march across the square to the embassy 
about 40 then tried to sit in the road causing police to remove 
them he said three people were arrested and one policeman was 
taken to the hospital with broken ribs he said

this should not be allowed in the united states of america 
was her only comment as she left the courthouse 
potter after meeting with attorneys in chambers also denied 
defense lawyers motions for a mistrial for a continuance and for 
dismissal of the indictment against bakker 
bakker who resigned from the ptl ministry in 1987 during a 
sexandmoney scandal went on trial aug 28 on conspiracy and fraud

reality 
he did not lose sight that they were actually the press she 
said it was an experience in which he was very frightened and

a honduran drug kingpin whose extradition 
triggered deadly riots in his homeland was convicted of cocaine 
smuggling wednesday in what prosecutors hailed as a victory for the 
us war on drugs 
prosecutors had called juan ramon matta ballesteros 45 one of 
the most significant narcotics traffickers in the world but his 
lawyer portrayed him as a legitimate businessman and the single 
largest employer in honduras before his arrest 
us district court jurors found guilty of masterminding a 
california drug ring linked to a colombian cocaine cartel he was 
convicted of one count of conspiracy one count of running a 
continuing criminal enterprise one count of possession with intent 
to distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine 
the us drug enforcement administration claimed matta ran a 
narcotics empire worth up to 2 billion he was accused of 
overseeing a network that distributed 72 million worth of cocaine 
in los angeles 
the conviction of ballesteros is a major blow to the gangsters 
who run the international drug rings attorney general dick 
thornburgh said in a statement from washington 
mattas extradition triggered outrage in his homeland and 2000 
demonstrators burned the us embassy annex five hondurans died in 
the disturbances which lasted a week 
mattas lawyer called him a victim of massive publicity 
surrounding joint uscolombian efforts to extradite major drug 
kingpins but us attorney gary feess said he was convicted by 
evidence not publicity 
defense attorney martin stolar said he sent a telegram to 
president bush tuesday urging him to delay his address to the nation 
about drugs until the jury returned its verdict he received no 
response 
the cocaine wars and the war against drugs have been frontpage 
news for three weeks more than half the length of this trial 
stolar said that kind of prejudicial publicity makes it difficult 
for a jury to concentrate on what happens in the courtroom 
feess said matta was the kingpin for a powerful cocaine cartel 
based in cali colombia that funneled thousands of pounds of 
cocaine to arizona and southern california through mexico 
he said mattas power was comparable to that of carlos lehder 
the powerful drug lord convicted earlier this year in miami feess 
said matta was one of the largest drug kingpins ever convicted 
the charges against matta stemmed from a september 1981 raid on a 
van nuys apartment complex that netted 19 million in cash and 114 
pounds of cocaine at that time the largest seizure of the drug in 
california history 
us district judge pamela ann rymer scheduled sentencing for 
oct 5 feess said matta could be sentenced to a maximum of life 
imprisonment without parole 
stolar said he would appeal

the chairman of stroh brewery co said 
wednesday the detroitbased company was withdrawing its sponsorship 
of national audubon society television specials but insisted the 
action had nothing to do with a threatened boycott by northwest 
loggers 
we sought to keep these issues separate and unrelated peter 
stroh said in a statement adding the decision to drop 
underwiriting of the series reflected the companys mounting 
financial problems 
northwest loggers upset with an upcoming program on the regions 
ancient forests had begun a looselyorganized campaign in which 
they threatened to boycott the brewerys products unless stroh 
dropped its support for the specials 
environmental sources who asked to remain anonymous had earlier 
said that stroh requested that changes be made in the program 
ancient forests rage over trees and when the audubon society 
refused the company decided to drop its 600000 in underwriting 
it had been the intention of the stroh brewery co to first 
resolve the issue in the pacific northwest regarding the upcoming 
special before discussing our ability to continue underwriting the 
world of audubon specials stroh said 
stroh said his company was diligently looking for financial 
partners and the fact we were reviewing our sponsorship of these 
specials was due to questions raised from our ongoing discussions 
with other brewers 
however in light of the confusion and uncertainty which has 
arisen since the issues became intertwined we have decided it would 
be best for us and for the national audubon society to announce we 
are now going to relinquish our sponsorship of future programs 
already produced in order to facilitate the audubons search for a 
successor sponsor 
the timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a 
bitter struggle for months over future logging in the northwests 
oldgrowth forests which provide prime habitat for the northern 
spotted owl 
the audubon society is among the environmental groups that have 
sought to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered 
species and logging in the ancient forests halted 
audubon society officials have insisted that the special on the 
ancient forests which will be shown on cable television on sept 24 
and on public television later was fair and balanced 
stroh has provided about half the funding for the fourshow 
series with the balance coming from turner broadcasting system 
kirsten white a turner spokeswoman said wednesday that her 
company had also received calls from loggers concerned about the 
content of the show 
white said turner had no plans to drop the show 
it will still air she said

a quadriplegic is entitled to have the ventilator 
that keeps him alive modified so that he can shut it off and end his 
life at will a state judge ruled wednesday 
larry mcafees right to refuse continued lifesustaining medical 
treatment outweighs the states interest in preserving life ruled 
fulton county superior court judge edward johnson after an emotional 
45minute hearing 
five family members and two friends testified that mcafee an 
avid sportsman paralyzed from the neck down since a may 1985 
motorcycle accident had repeatedly told them he wanted to die 
rather than continue as he is 
doctors have said his condition is irreversible 
attorney randall davis said mcafee who has been in an alabama 
nursing home since midaugust will be brought back to an 
atlantaarea apartment 
there was no immediate indication when he might be returned from 
alabama 
the judge ordered the state to appeal his decision immediately to 
the georgia supreme court but said mcafee does not have to wait on 
the court to hear the appeal to be fitted with the switchoff 
device which mcafee designed 
the ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his 
life it is prolonging his death said the judge adding that he 
found mcafee to be a rational competent intelligent adult capable 
of making that decision 
mcafee had asked that he be given a sedative when he shuts off 
the machine and that the court promise that no one will restart the 
breathing apparatus 
a petition filed last month in fulton county superior court 
included an affidavit stating i understand turning off the 
ventilator will result in my death signed by a shaky x made 
with a pencil held in mcafees mouth 
davis said the matter is in the courts to assure that no criminal 
or civil challenges arise against those who help mcafee end his life 
state attorney general michael bowers said last month that 
suicide is not a crime in georgia and that mcafee has a legal right 
to refuse medical treatment and that there is no opposing public 
interest that overrides those rights 
mcafee spent a year in a spinal rehabilitation center after his 
accident then seven months in his own apartment with 
roundtheclock nursing care until his insurance ran out since 
then he has had a struggle finding a home the only nursing home 
his family could find that would take him for what georgias 
medicaid program paid was in ohio 
he was sent away from there after nursing home officials said he 
was verbally abusive in january he went to atlantas grady 
memorial hospital a public institution that by law could not turn 
him away 
he was transferred to a nursing home in alabaster ala last 
month pending a ruling on his petition

a roman catholic church commission said 
wednesday more talks are needed to resolve the issue of the convent 
at the auschwitz death camp which has severely strained relations 
with the worlds jews 
cardinal franciszek macharski whose archdiocese includes the 
camp has angered jews by refusing to honor an agreement of feb 22 
1987 to move the convent to an interfaith prayer center farther 
away 
in a statement released by the official news agency pap the 
commission for dialogue with judaism said the conflict around the 
carmelite convent has led to an almost complete breakdown of 
christianjewish dialogue in the world 
resumption of dialogue seems impossible without solving this 
conflict all this confirms the urgent need of building the 
interfaith center however we state with regret the idea of the 
center has not received appropriate interest and understanding on 
the jewish side 
taking up talks in the spirit of the geneva meetings without 
additional conditions will allow we trust the finding of 
realistic possibilities of building the center 
the commission of clergy and lay intellectuals said there is a 
special obligation to take advantage of all possible means to remove 
the existing tensions and conflicts because of the camps 
significance as a memorial 
an estimated 4 million people died at auschwitz 25 million of 
them jews the carmelite convent of 14 nuns is in a former theater 
used by the nazis as a storehouse just outside the fence 
jews say it is deeply offensive to have chrisitan symbols 
including a tall wooden cross at a place where millions of jews 
were killed in the nazi extermination program 
according to the commission cardinal macharskis statement 
refusing to uphold the 1987 agreement was not inconsistent with 
previous church positions it said macharski felt obliged to act 
because polemics and violent protest had become a threat to the 
interfaith center 
in a newspaper interview published saturday in italy cardinal 
jozef glemp polands catholic primate said he agreed the nuns 
should not be moved and indicated he would like more negotiations 
with jewish leaders 
theo klein who led the jewish delegation at the geneva talks 
said renegotiation was out of the question 
cardinals godfried danneels of brussels jeanmarie lustiger of 
paris and albert decourtray of lyon who signed the agreement along 
with macharski issued a joint statement saying it must be carried 
out

legislation to ease the debt burden of polands 
new noncommunist government and to provide an aid fund of up to 
300 million a year was introduced on wednesday by sen paul simon 
dill 
the proposal which is significantly larger than the 100 million 
in us assistance proposed earlier this year by president bush 
also would include 25 million to modernize polands telephone 
system 
simon told the senate his request is based on conversations in 
poland last year with solidarity union leader lech walesa and other 
polish leaders and officials 
i think it is important that the united states act and act 
swiftly and act generously simon told the senate if poland can 
shift over to a freeenterprise system that will affect hungary and 
eventually the soviet union as well it is going to change the 
political map of the world 
simon said his proposal would suspend interest on polands debt 
to us financial institutions for three years and reduce it for an 
additional two years 
poland simon said has a 39 billion foreign debt of which some 
8 percent is owed to us banks 
he said diplomatic representatives of at least two other nations 
with outstanding loans to poland have expressed interest in the plan 
to ease interest payments 
the simon proposal calls for the creation of a revolving fund of 
300 million a year over a threeyear period 
he said 100 million of the total would be earmarked for 
agricultural purposes especially grain production 
he said the plan includes safeguards permitting the president to 
suspend the aid program at any time 
this is not a substitute for poland facing its own problems 
simon said 
but what we have now is a very critical time period in which we 
have to move he said america must come through

in congress first legislative response to 
president bushs antidrug campaign a senate effort to bolster 
treatment programs by cutting funds for congressional mailings was 
halted wednesday by a single senator 
the measure proposed by republicans and accepted by democrats 
would slash the 80 million pot proposed for congressional mail for 
next year to 35 million the other 45 million would be transferred 
to a treatment program for pregnant women addicted to crack cocaine 
and other drugs 
but a vote was blocked by sen ted stevens ralaska who argued 
that such a sharp reduction in the mail lawmakers send their 
constituents would deprive alaskans of an important source of news 
stevens said many alaskans get no daily newspapers and learn of news 
from washington only from radio and brief television broadcasts 
this is wrong stevens said this is a nation that has been 
kept together by communications 
stevens objections forced senate leaders to postpone a vote 
until at least thursday 
the measure was proposed by sen pete wilson rcalif a 
supporter of tougher efforts against drug abuse a longtime critic 
of the burgeoning costs of legislators mailings and a candidate for 
governor of california 
my purpose is not to denigrate the newsletter wilson told 
his colleagues it is instead to point out that there is a far 
more urgent a far more compelling priority making a claim upon 
those same funds 
the proposal put democrats in a difficult position by forcing 
them to choose between assisting an antidrug program serving a 
vulnerable segment of society or maintaining their ability to 
pepper their constituents with newsletters 
sen harry reid dnev chairman of the appropriations 
legislative subcommittee said democrats would accept wilsons 
proposal 
the proposal was offered as an amendment to legislation providing 
2 billion for congress own expenses for the 1990 fiscal year 
which begins oct 1 the house version of the bill contains no such 
reduction in funds for mailing and negotiators from the two 
chambers will eventually have to decide its fate 
in his tuesday evening speech presenting his 79 billion drug 
campaign bush proposed spending 300 million for treatment 
programs he listed initiatives to help pregnant drug users as part 
of the effort but did not specifically say how much should be spent 
for them 
as important as newletters may be and notices for town meetings 
may be are they as important as what the president outlined last 
night on the war on drugs asked senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan 
wilson said that 400000 babies are born annually in the united 
states to drugaddicted mothers 
the program the money would go to created in 1988 is supposed 
to spend up to 10 million annually for addicted pregnant women 
especially for those who use crack this year only 45 million has 
actually been spent wilson said 
the legislative spending bill is perenially a battleground for 
fights between the house and senate 
one of those disputes this year is over congressional mailing 
costs the 16 billion house version of the bill approved july 31 
contained 1247 million for mailing 
as approved by the senate appropriations committee the bill 
would provide 80 million for congressional mailings 48 million 
for the house and 32 million for the senate the house has 435 
members while the senate has 100 
the senate bill would also reduce from six to two the number of 
districtwide mailings permitted each year except for notices of 
town meetings legislators could send more but would have to pay 
for them out of the funds each receives for general office expenses 
this years congressional mail expenses are expected to total 
539 million but traditionally lawmakers mailings increase 
dramatically in election years and 1990 is one of those 
critics of congressional mailings have argued that they are often 
little more than taxpayerassisted publicity for incumbents 
the legislation also establishes a health club which would 
include exercise classes for senate members and employees

the us ambassador to lebanon 
said wednesday that he is ready to return to beirut as soon as the 
safety of his staff can be guaranteed 
ambassador john mccarthy and members of his staff arrived at the 
us militarys rhinemain air base outside frankfurt late wednesday 
on a us air force c130 transport plane from cyprus 
earlier in the day he and 29 staffers were airlifted from 
beirut where christians had threatened to expose the american 
diplomats to a good dose of christian terrorism for what they 
said was us support of syria 
at an airport news conference a weary mccarthy said he left 
lebanon with great reluctance 
it seemed to me that we were doing important work there the 
relationship between us and the lebanese has always been a very warm 
one 
but mccarthy said developments in recent days left him little 
alternative but to close the facility 
it just seemed to me that in the last several days it was no 
longer possible for me to guarantee to washington that the safety of 
my staff was secure and it was for that reason that we left 
mccarthy said 
but as soon as those questions of security and safety can be 
resolved it seems to be that it would be important for us to resume 
the work that we were doing in beirut 
asked about the fate of 16 foreign hostages in lebanon mccarthy 
said one of my considerable regrets is that i had very little 
opportunity to make an impact on the hostage situation 
the hostages are held in west beirut or in other areas in 
lebanon that are basically closed to me and have been for some time 
we would once in a while pick up the odd rumor but aside from 
that we were not in a good position to do very much for the 
hostages the ambassador said 
the hostages held in lebanon included eight americans 
longestheld is terry a anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
mccarthy said he and the embassy staff had worked hard to close 
the facility when word came to evacuate 
we spent all last night trying to clear the embassy about 10 
hours putting things away destroying things the ambassador 
told reporters 
about 1000 christians massed outside the embassy to protest what 
they said was us support of syria that country entered lebanon in 
1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate but later sided with 
moslems in the 14yearold sectarian civil war 
it is the first time an american ambassador has been pulled from 
lebanon since the civil war began the move at least temporarily 
ended the american diplomatic presence in the country 
the ambassador and his staff were first flown to britains 
akrotiri air base in nearby cyprus they are expected to leave for 
the united states on thursday

financially strapped federal agencies lack the 
staff and equipment to handle a major oil spill in the great lakes 
and plans for such an emergency are weak experts told a senate 
panel wednesday 
the government also is doing a poor job of preventing and 
cleaning up the hundreds of smaller oil and toxic chemical leaks 
that pollute the great lakes each year witnesses told the 
governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of government 
management 
the subcommittee launched an investigation of the federal 
governments handling of great lakes spills in the wake of the march 
24 exxon valdez disaster off the alaskan coast sen carl levin 
dmich the subcommittee chairman said the lakes situation was 
disquieting 
the great lakes are far more vulnerable to spills than most 
people realize and there are far more inadequacies in our spill 
response and prevention capabilities than we can or should 
tolerate said sen carl levin dmich chairman of the 
subcommittee 
the question is whether enough welltrained people and equipment 
can be transported to a major spill quickly enough to contain it 
said david f hales director of the michigan department of natural 
resources 
im afraid the answer is that we are not prepared hales 
said 
the largest tankers on the lakes hold only 120000 barrels less 
than 9 percent of what the exxon valdez carried hales acknowledged 
but levin and other witnesses said a spill from such a vessel could 
be just as damaging because the lakes are less capable of dispersing 
pollutants than the oceans 
the great lakes are a closed system a bathtub whose waters 
can take hundreds of years to leave the system levin said 
hales criticized the oil industry for announcing plans to open 
five emergency response centers for oil spills along the ocean 
coasts but none along the lakes 
the american petroleum institute said in a statement its new york 
response office would handle great lakes spills equipment from 
the center could be rapidly airlifted to any great lakes port 
the statement said 
an increase in spills in recent years has occurred simultaneously 
with environmental protection agency cutbacks on inspections of 
onshore oil storage facilities and the coast guards 50 percent cut 
in marine safety and environmental protection programs since 1980 
levin said 
there were 401 oil and chemical spills in the lakes in 1986 384 
in 1987 and 492 in 1988 some were large such as the 1984 discharge 
of 1 million gallons of fuel oil from a storage tank in new york and 
a 1984 spill of 200000 gallons of toxic ammonia from a michigan 
industrial plant

the army has arrested 27 palestinians for 
illegally crossing into israel since new identity cards were first 
distributed in the occupied gaza strip three months ago an army 
spokesman said wednesday 
meanwhile the military commander of the gaza strip said violence 
is increasing in the israelioccupied territory 
in the gaza strip eight palestinians were shot and wounded in 
clashes with soldiers hospital officials said the army said it was 
investigating the reports and confirmed two wounded in a west bank 
village 
at least 558 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops or 
civilians since the uprising against israeli rule of the occupied 
territories began in december 1987 thirtynine israelis have died 
in the violence 
also wednesday an opposition member of parliament asked israels 
attorney general to ensure that the computerized identity cards are 
not used for collective punishment 
the army spokesman said the arabs detained for crossing into 
israel without cards were given the choice of paying a 250 fine or 
spending two months in prison israel radio said one palestinian was 
acquitted 
the plastic cards are only issued to gazans who have paid their 
taxes and passed security checks 
israel says they are necessary to improve security but 
palestinian leaders say they undercut arabs ability to work in 
israel an estimated 50000 gazans hold jobs in israel 
the cards have sparked a political tug of war with palestinian 
activists sometimes collecting the cards by force and burning them 
army radio said over the past four days an average of 5000 to 
10000 palestinians have crossed daily from gaza into israel about 
onequarter the total before the new cards were issued 
the radio said it was unclear whether workers were intimidated by 
palestinian activists or were sleeping in israel instead of 
commuting 
meanwhile the army commander for gaza maj gen matan vilnai 
said violence has increased in gaza and that the uprising has 
changed from mass demonstrations to hitandrun attacks by masked 
palestinians 
the masked youths enforce uprising directives and often kill 
fellow arabs suspected of collaborating with israel at least 108 
palestinians have been killed in this way 
we are meeting them more and more and attacking them more and 
more vilnai said on army radio 
in a strongly worded letter dedi zucker of the leftwing 
citizens rights movement called for strict controls so that the 
cards are used for legitimate security purposes and not for 
collective punishment and collective sanctions 
he asked attorney general yosef harish to rule on whether gazans 
denied the new cards by the army could be blocked from entering 
israel to visit hospitalized relatives or prisoners 
zucker also asked whether troops could ban entry to arab workers 
from a village if they wanted to punish the community for activities 
stemming from the 20monthold uprising against israeli rule 
in the west bank town of tulkarem arab residents said seven 
israeli security men disguised as uprising activists arrested two 
brothers in a raid tuesday night 
the brothers were identified as issam and samir el sarougi arab 
reports said issam had been wanted for antiisraeli activities the 
past year

west german businessmen and 
bankers told solidarity leader lech walesa on wednesday they are 
willing to help revive polands economy but said the poles want too 
much too soon 
walesa said he understood the caution but renewed his appeal for 
more west german investment 
the banking experts at the moment still have reservations 
because the conditions in my country are not good he said to 
journalists after meeting with the eastern committee an influential 
industry organization that coordinates business dealings in the east 
bloc 
walesa said he told the committee we want to work intensely 
with you we want to invite you to help build a different 
economic system 
otto wolff von amerongen head of the eastern committee said 
however that wishes on the polish side for a comprehensive 
program of new credits cannot be met 
in london prime minister margaret thatchers office said she had 
urged the united states west germany and france to give poland more 
support a spokesman said she sent messages to president bush 
chancellor helmut kohl and president francois mitterrand saying 
there is a historic opportunity for the west to help polands 
reforms succeed and demonstrate that a country can successfully make 
the transition from communism and from an entirely staterun 
economy 
wolff the eastern committee chairman told journalists all 
relevant political forces in poland should themselves reach a 
consensus over the necessary program to cure the economy 
western capital aid should only be one element of the 
program he said adding that the new solidarityled government 
cannot expect quick investment by west germans because of the huge 
financial risk involved while poland is overhauling its its economy 
changing over from one system to another is more difficult than 
starting from scratch as is the case here wolff said it would 
be an illusion to believe this could be achieved quickly 
nonetheless wolff promised walesa he could count on west german 
assistance in rebuilding the polish economy 
he said his committee would be consulting with polish joint 
venture specialists about ways to improve their countrys investment 
climate 
walesa arrived in west germany on tuesday for five days of talks 
with politicians and businesspeople to center on economic aid and 
reform in poland 
polands economy suffers from widespread shortages more than 100 
percent annual inflation a 39 billion foreign debt and 
unprofitable and outmoded industries 
earlier in the day in a speech to labor union officials walesa 
appealed to western countries to ease terms of polands foreign debt 
he also said solidarity is under tremendous pressure from the 
polish people now that it controls the government 
our country is a total economic catastrophe walesa said in a 
speech before the national coordinating committee of the powerful 
german federation of labor unions 
since solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki became the east 
blocs first noncommunist government leader last month poles have 
turned their hopes for improved living standards to the trade union 
some doubt whether solidarity really has an economic program i 
want to give these people an answer we know full well what we are 
striving for he said 
before walesa spoke ernst breit chairman of the federation of 
labor unions called on the west german government to make a quick 
decision on financial assistance for poland 
referring to nazi germanys invasion of poland 50 years ago that 
started world war ii breit said germans have a moral 
responsibility to take the leading role in helping poland achieve 
economic stability

georgias 156yearold law that makes it a 
felony for a husband and wife to engage in sodomy cannot be applied 
to consenting married couples a judge ruled wednesday 
government has no business with a married couples private 
consensual sexual practices wrote dekalb county superior court 
judge robert castellani 
in his fivepage decision castellani said james d moseley had 
been imprisoned illegally more than 18 months after being convicted 
for violating that law 
moseley 35 a carpenter had been sentenced to two years he was 
ordered released on bond by castellani last week pending his 
decision 
this court believes the petitioners right to marital and 
domestic privacy has been violated by the sodomy law as applied to 
him castellani wrote 
moseley had been charged with two counts of rape two counts of 
aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated anal sodomy in 
february 1988 after his commonlaw wife bette roberts filed 
complaints against him saying he had forced himself on her after 
they were separated 
he denied using force but testified that the couple had engaged 
in oral sex with ms roberts consent he was acquitted on five 
counts but was convicted on a lesser charge of oral sodomy 
castellani noted that during recent us supreme court 
considerations that upheld application of the sodomy law against 
homosexuals both the majority analysis and state attorney general 
michael bowers recognize the problems in applying this law to 
married consenting couples 
insofar as the judge holds as a matter of law that the sodomy 
statute cant be applied to a married couple that is exactly 
what we had said bowers said wednesday 
but he said a decision on whether to appeal the ruling would be 
delayed until he has a chance to examine it fully 
the state had argued that moseley should remain in jail because 
the record supports an inference the victim did not consent to 
the sodomy castellani wrote but the judge said the jurys 
acquittal of moseley on the rape and aggravated sodomy charges meant 
it decided no force had been involved 
were very pleased with the decision our client is now 
free said julie edelson one of the american civil liberties 
union lawyers who argued moseleys case in court 
moseley could not be reached for comment wednesday telephone 
messages left for him with the aclu were not returned 
he had said last week that ms roberts had filed charges against 
him as part of a lengthy domestic dispute 
i only did what she wanted me to do and then she used it 
against me to get custody of the kids he said he said he was 
granted no visiting rights to see his sons 
ms roberts responded by repeating her assertions that moseley 
forced himself on her

attorney general dick thornburgh will not meet 
with mayor marion barry to discuss news leaks in a grand jury probe 
into barrys ties to a convicted drug dealer a spokesman for 
thornburgh said on wednesday 
its not appropriate for the attorney general to meet with him 
at this time thornburgh spokesman david runkel said 
he declined to elaborate 
barry angered over news reports that former city employee 
charles lewis has told prosecutors he and barry smoked crack cocaine 
together had said he wanted to meet with thornburgh to ask him to 
investigate alleged justice department leaks to the news media 
thornburghs refusal to meet with barry is the second legal 
disappointment for the mayor in as many days on tuesday us 
attorney jay b stephens said that he is forbidden by law from 
releasing barrys testimony before a federal grand jury 
investigating his ties to lewis 
barry who spent more than five hours testifying on his visits to 
lewis hotel room last december had sought to release the testimony 
in an effort to prove that he had truthfully denied using drugs with 
lewis 
barry has steadfastly maintained he is not the target or the 
subject of the lewis probe but stephens cited a law that bars the 
testimony of potential witnesses from being released prior to a 
trial 
barry spokeswoman lurma rackley said the mayor has not received a 
formal denial from thornburgh on their proposed meeting and will not 
comment until he has 
thornburgh is already investigating whether justice officials 
leaked information on a preliminary fbi investigation into alleged 
payroll irregularities in the office of rep william h gray iii 
dpa 
the news reports which came in late may as gray was positioning 
himself to run for house democratic whip prompted gray to charge 
that the leaks had been politically motivated 
thornburgh promptly wrote a letter to gray telling him the matter 
would be investigated although he rejected grays request that an 
independent prosecutor be appointed to look into the matter 
gray ultimately was elected to the whips post which is the 
thirdranking house leadership post while justice officials are 
still trying to determine the source of the news leaks 
stephens has already asked the justice department to investigate 
whether the reports on lewis were leaked from his office

police said they arrested 116 british 
soccer fans who rampaged through stockholms shopping district 
wednesday before a world cup qualifying match 
police inspector gunnar skold said 71 other people were arrested 
including four britons outside rasunda stadium during and after the 
swedenengland game which ended in a 00 tie one of those arrested 
was hospitalized 
it was less than we had expected police superintendent sture 
hoglund told swedish television 
hoglund said about 1000 british fans watched the game at the 
stadium from a separate standing area and no incidents were reported 
skold told the associated press the fans seized in downtown 
stockholm probably would not have been admitted to the game in any 
event because most of them had no tickets and appeared drunk 
the rowdies apparently teenagers for the most part ran through 
the shopping area shouting abuse slapping passersby and ripping 
clothing from stores outside display racks police with riot 
shields gave chase and scuffled with them 
skold said the arrested britons would be sent home as soon as 
possible 
scattered incidents of brawling and vandalism were reported 
earlier in restaurants and on trains as about 2000 visitors 
filtered through the city awaiting the match 
the swedes had prepared for a dose of british soccer hooliganism 
after one fan drowned monday when he jumped overboard from a ferry 
in the north sea that was bringing hundreds of fans to stockholm 
british police said he was under the influence of drugs and panicked 
when companions sprayed him with a fire extinguisher 
british soccer clubs were banned from playing in european club 
competition after their fans were blamed for a 1986 riotsparked 
stampede in belgium that killed 39 specators mainly italians the 
ban did not apply to the national team 
wednesdays events in stockholm could affect a decision earlier 
this year by the uefa the frenchbased european soccer clubs 
governing body to readmit the british clubs next year if 
troublemakers are brought under control 
security was unprecedented for a swedish sporting event police 
assigned 600 officers to the stadium in suburban stockholm and 
swedish radio said authorities were ready to stop the match if 
trouble broke out 
the swedish football association said that at the request of its 
british counterpart it withheld nearly 4000 tickets it normally 
would have put on sale in britain 
the british fa told us they didnt want any tickets sold in 
england because of the trouble with hooligans when england has 
played in other countries abroad said lena linborg the 
associations ticket manager 
specators were to subjected to body searches and television 
cameras were placed to monitor the crowd riot fences surrounded the 
stadium 
five britons were arrested monday after they rampaged through a 
restaurant three were released and two were held on charges of 
assault and causing serious damage 
on wednesday about 20 fans helped themselves to beer at a 
selfservice cafe without paying one was apprehended by a patrolman 
and the rest fled 
ferry companies and travel agencies refused to accept group 
bookings from britain to sweden preceding the match the tudor arms 
which claims to be the only english pub in stockholm closed its 
doors to avoid trouble 
everybody recognizes there is a problem with the hooligans in 
england the british charge daffaires brian austin said in a 
radio interview 
austin responding to calls in the swedish media to expel the 
british soccer fans said it is difficult to distinguish between 
people who want to see the match and who genuinely like football 
and the other sort

a split in the main opposition bloc 
appeared to widen wednesday over the choice of a former sandinista 
labor minister as its vice presidential candidate in february 
elections 
the national opposition union asked the supreme electoral council 
to extend by two weeks the friday deadline for applying for legal 
recognition as a bloc silviano matamoros of the national 
conservative party said tuesday 
the request indicated the coalition was not sure how many of its 
14 parties ranging from communists to conservatives would stick 
together for the feb 25 1990 general election 
since the opposition union picked its ticket on saturday the 
leading topic for radio talk shows television and newspapers has 
been the choice of politician virgilio godoy over businessman 
enrique bolanos 
few people have disputed the choice of violeta barrios de 
chamorro publisher of the opposition newspaper la prensa as the 
opposition unions presidential candidate 
how the discord is resolved will greatly influence if not 
determine the election results only a united opposition could 
unseat the sandinista government 
none of the 20 opposition nicaraguan parties could 
singlehandedly win a race three parties outside the opposition 
union have announced their own candidates but their power is 
considered negligible 
president daniel ortega is expected to run for reelection but 
the government has yet to announce its ticket 
the two figures at the center of the opposition union feud are 
trying to avoid a split 
godoy an able politician is lobbying all sides trying to glue 
the bloc back together 
bolanos is avoiding the public light 
when asked to comment on the opposition union infighting bolanos 
said its not prudent my opinion is of no import at this time 
im simply observing nothing more 
he said he might speak publicly on friday during free 
enterprise day designated by the superior council of private 
enterprise he is a former president of the council 
godoy president of the independent liberal party said he was 
talking to various parties to see how we can contribute to avoid 
further squabbling 
i think well be able to overcome this so that the blood 
wont reach the river godoy said 
cracks in the opposition union began to show late saturday just 
minutes after godoy was chosen with mrs chamorro the ticket 
obtained 10 votes out of a possible 14 
leaders of three parties abstaining left the meeting after the 
final vote one partys ballot was annulled 
on tuesday matamoros said the opposition unions politicial 
council was reviewing the votes because there was a dispute over the 
way a fifth party marked its ballot 
godoy is linked to an unpopular system of salary levels created 
while he was labor minister from 1979 to 1984 
the business community felt wages for workers were too high 
professionals thought their salaries were too low and most people 
thought the issue was best decided between employer and employee 
godoy was thought to balance the ticket with mrs chamorro whose 
membership in the nicaraguan aristocracy pleases conservatives 
but some have said godoys politics are too far to the left

rescue helicopters on wednesday 
airlifted to safety the survivors of a varig jetliner that 
crashlanded in the amazon rain forest killing at least 10 of the 
54 people aboard 
its incredible that we came out alive said regia acevedo 
who was thrown from the plane sunday night with her husband when the 
boeing 737200 went down about 1050 miles northwest of rio de 
janeiro 
the plane seemed to bounce when it first hit the tops of 
100foot trees survivors said it cut a 120foot by 300foot swath 
through the jungle and both wings were ripped off but the fuselage 
remained nearly intact they said 
it was as if a giant claw had scratched the body of the plane 
first there was a deafening screech and then a silence and then 
absolute darkness said ms acevedo 29 
i thought my god im going to die said jose maria 
gadelha suddenly there was a flash of lightning i lost 
consciousness and when i woke up i was outside the plane and 
alive 
we were ready to die but the hand of god guided our descent 
said epaminondas de sousa chaves 36 one of four people who walked 
through the jungle to a remote ranch tuesday to report the location 
of the plane 
medical teams first reached the crash site tuesday night but 
officials decided to wait until first light wednesday to start 
removing survivors 
the survivors were taken 28 miles to a ranch where a 
brazilianmade twinengine bandeirante plane took off from a dirt 
airstrip and flew to the serra do cachimbo air force base 185 miles 
away in neighboring para state said an air force spokesman col 
jose maria dos santos 
he said two passengers died wednesday bringing the death count 
to 10 he said a man trapped in the wreckage died wednesday morning 
while a woman airlifted from the crash site died later on a rescue 
plane en route to brasilia 
passenger marinez coimbra said those killed were sitting closest 
to the cockpit those in the front suffered the worst she said 
in a televised interview 
six people were in serious condition 
the plane disappeared sunday after taking off from maraba on the 
last leg of a regularly scheduled flight between the southeastern 
city of sao paulo and belem 
an air force ministry spokesman col ronaldo borges said the 
pilot had reported problems in the navigational system and the plane 
strayed far off course 
epaminondas de sousa chaves said the plane had been flying in 
circles for 90 minutes before the crash 
the captain said that he was having trouble finding 
belem he said i got nervous then and started praying 
minutes later with a calm voice the pilot asked for 
forgiveness and told us we had 15 minutes of fuel left and he 
couldnt see a single clear spot in the jungle 
suddenly the engines shut down and i dont know if 10 15 or 
one minute passed it was agony 
the brazilian airline did not give the cause of the accident 
varig president helio smidt did not rule out a navigational error 
but said we shouldnt jump to quick conclusions

president ranasinghe premadasa on 
wednesday asked security forces to restrain themselves when dealing 
with sinhalese extremists who are trying to topple his government 
officials said 
in other words the president told the military and police not 
to shoot first treat those arrested under law and win the 
confidence of people the government officials said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
opposition politicians human rights groups and residents accuse 
the military of killing hundreds of civilians during crackdowns on 
extremists of the peoples liberation front the government denies 
it but senior officials privately admit killings by progovernment 
vigilante groups 
premadasas appeal came at a meeting in colombo with senior 
military police and intelligence officers the officials said 
premadasa advised them to act firmly against terrorism but to 
always remember they are dealing with their own brothers and 
sisters they said 
the officials said the meeting was called to brief officers on a 
proposed meeting of all political parties on sept 13 aimed at 
resolving this island nations ethnic troubles 
premadasa invited the front to the meeting it has not yet 
responded the ultranationalist group rejected earlier government 
peace offers 
military officials said wednesday that in the latest crackdown 
security forces arrested 224 suspected front members since monday 
and that 153 militants surrendered 
the arrests were made in central and southern sri lanka the 
sinhalese heartland where the militant campaign is centered 
the northeast is ravaged by a tamil insurgency for an independent 
nation that the government tried to end with an indiasponsored 
peace accord in 1987 
the accord supervised by indian peacekeeping troops angered the 
sinhalese militants who complained it conceded too much to the 
minority tamils they began a violent campaign that the government 
says has claimed 5000 lives the militants also said the indian 
presence compromised sri lankas independence 
the 6yearold tamil war has killed 11000 more people including 
1000 indian soldiers 
tamils who are mostly hindus say they are discriminated in jobs 
and education by the mainly buddhist sinhalese majority 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
sinhalese 75 percent 
india became involved because of political pressures from its own 
60 million tamils most of whom live in southern tamil nadu state a 
narrow strip of sea separates tamil nadu from sri lanka

a woman on trial for the murder of 
her lesbian lover testified wednesday that she shot to death her 
companion of 11 years to defend herself from abuse 
the socalled battered spouse syndrome is being used by 
defense attorneys in the firstdegree murder trial of annette green 
the first time in which the psychological state has been applied to 
a lesbian case attorneys say 
i never wanted to do anything to her i never wanted to hurt 
her ms green testified i was just trying to defend myself 
ms green 30 had been beaten and tormented for years before she 
fired a single shot from a 38caliber pistol into the head of her 
livein lover ivonne julio 32 last october defense attorney 
william lasley contends 
palm beach circuit judge tom waddell ruled tuesday to allow the 
battered spouse defense in the lesbian case saying the type of 
relationship made no difference 
the defense has been used successfully before to excuse women who 
killed their male lovers 
neighbors friends and coworkers have testified that ms green 
often was beaten viciously by ms julio and suffered broken bones 
bruises and black eyes they said the fatal shooting followed a 
night of arguing between the couple at a halloween party 
ms green testified that after the shooting she was shocked at 
what she had done and even considered suicide 
i had the gun to my head she testified why did i have the 
gun to my head i was going to kill myself because i loved her 
mary ann duttondouglas a psychologist at nova university in 
fort lauderdale who specializes in battered women cases testified 
tuesday that the shooting should be interpreted as a response to 
years of abuse 
i believe that she was trying to figure a way out of the 
situation ms duttondouglas said but she was backed into a 
corner 
earlier efforts by ms green to leave failed because ms julio 
would find her at work or win her back by promising to change ms 
duttondouglas said 
leaving didnt mean her partner would leave her alone ms 
duttondouglas said 
assistant state attorney robert johnson questioned the 
reliability of ms duttondouglas conclusions suggesting that ms 
green could have falsified answers to psychological tests to appear 
to be suffering from the syndrome 
closing arguments are scheduled for thursday

the family of a sailor implicated in the april 
19 turret explosion aboard the uss iowa hopes to clear his name in 
court 
a navy investigation into the april 19 explosion in the 
battleships no 2 gun turret found foreign material in the 
immediate area of the blast according to sources familiar with the 
navys report to be made public thursday 
the sources said an unlawful and illegal act by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig is pinpointed in the navys report as the probable 
cause of the blast 
kathy kubicina hartwigs sister and the hartwig familys 
spokeswoman on the investigation expects lawyers representing the 
family to file a lawsuit after the report is released but she would 
not provide details of the legal plans wednesday night 
she said the navy has promised to send an official to brief the 
family thursday morning 
the family hired lawyers june 1 two lawyers held a briefing aug 
3 outside the federal courthouse in cleveland during which they 
outlined the hartwig case 
at that briefing lawyer krieg brusnahan said hartwig had no role 
in the iowa disaster adding we have a possible theory as to the 
cause of the blast that we will release after the navys report has 
been released 
this is nothing i didnt expect ms kubicina said from her 
residence wednesday night i fully expected the navy to try and 
pin this on my brother 
it makes me wonder where the navy investigation would have 
turned to if i hadnt written the letters to the officers aboard the 
iowa in seeking help 
she contacted iowa officers after learning about an insurance 
policy hartwig held that named iowa crewman kendall truitt as 
beneficiary she said her brother and truitt had been close friends 
but their friendship had waned 
i now know the naval investigative service conducts witch 
hunts for homosexuality in the navy she said but then i just 
wanted ken to turn the money over to my parents and i wrote the 
officers for help i guess they gave the letters to the nis 
i knew there was nothing legally we could do about the 
insurance policy i thought they would be able to persuade him 
because truitt and my brother were no longer friends 
ms kubicina has said her brother to the best of her knowledge 
was not a homosexual she previously has released romantic letters 
he wrote to a woman she knows 
none of the guys on the iowa believe my brother blew up the 
turret she said as far as im concerned the report is another 
hurdle for us to get over we are definitely filing suit

president alfredo cristiani said 
wednesday that the government and leftist rebels will begin peace 
talks next week the first such talks in two years 
he told a news conference his government accepted a rebel 
proposal made tuesday that first exchanges be held in mexico between 
sunday and sept 14 but he cautioned the contacts would be 
essentially preparatory 
marxistled rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front have waged an insurrection for nearly 10 years against a 
series of usbacked governments the war has killed an estimated 
70000 people mostly civilians 
this meeting next week is to make the preparations for and 
provide the beginning of a dialogue process and it is not something 
from which substantive conclusions and accords are going to emerge 
it is to come to agreement in general terms on how to carry out the 
process within which substantive subjects will be addressed he 
said 
cristiani said contacts in coming days would determine exactly 
when and where the talks would take place 
cristiani a rightist who took office june 1 said he would swear 
in the government commission to the talks thursday he declined to 
identify members but leaks have indicated the delegation will 
include two cabinet ministers 
the government and rebels held two rounds of unsuccessful peace 
talks in 1984 and further talks in october 1987 
the time has passed for propagandistic or tactical dialogue 
the president said he said the new talks will have the serious aim 
of finding peace and incorporating the rebels in the peaceful life 
of the country 
rebel commander ana guadalupe martinez said in mexico on tuesday 
that the guerrillas want monsignor arturo rivera damas the roman 
catholic archbishop of san salvador to be moderator for the talks 
rivera damas is touring europe and the united states until 
midseptember and cristiani said his participation in initial 
exchanges is physically impossible 
the rebels have also insisted that delegates from the 
organization of american states and united nations be present 
talks with the government of former president jose napoleon 
duarte a centrist christian democrat failed to advance the search 
for peace

a 16member team of american aviation 
historians arrived wednesday hoping to solve the riddle of where 
amelia earhart disappeared on her 1937 attempt to make the first 
transpacific flight 
the international group of historic aircraft recovery based in 
wilmington del plans to leave suva on monday for two remote 
islands in the south pacific hoping to find evidence that earhart 
crashed there 
the group led by richard gillespie has chartered a converted 
japanese trawler the 125feet 100ton pacific nomad to reach the 
phoenix islands of mckean and nikumaroro in the kiribati 
archipelago 1000 miles northeast of fiji 
us embassy official robert benzinger said the group had 
fairly persuasive evidence that earhart went down much further 
eastward than previously thought 
the group is arriving with very thorough welldocumented 
research said benzinger they have two basic theories about 
where earhart crashed and if they find the evidence it will be 
sensational 
meanwhile an australian woman pilot gaby kennard is attempting 
to fly solo around the world in a singleengine plane as a tribute 
to earhart whose exploits achieved legendary status in the united 
states 
kennard a 44yearold mother of two flew this week to atchison 
kan earharts hometown kennard is a member of the 99 association 
of women pilots which earhart founded 
she expects to complete the journey to australia via europe the 
middle east and asia later this month 
benzinger said that the government of kiribati a group of 33 
islands straddling the equator gave permission for the monthlong 
expedition 
kiribati formerly the gilbert and ellice islands was a major 
battleground during world war ii and has a population of about 
61000 
theories abound about why earhart crashed after setting off for 
howland island in 1937 from wau papua new guinea to the north of 
australia 
howland lies north of the phoenix islands and has an airstrip 
that earhart had planned to use as a refuelling stop on the flight 
to hawaii with a navigator 
various theories suggest earhart crashed on the thenjapanese 
controlled marshall islands in micronesia and that she was executed 
after stumbling onto a military base 
benzinger himself an amateur aviation hobbyist said the 
american expedition hopes to show that earhart crashed much further 
eastward about 1500 miles east of the islands then controlled by 
japan 
there are two theories he said the first one requires 
that you assume the plane was extremely offcourse to the north 
which would mean the plane carried at least two more hours worth of 
fuel than was previously thought 
if you put yourself in the navigators position of trying to 
reach howland island and not making it you would try to find the 
nearest logical place to put the plane down and that would include 
mckean and nikumaroro atolls 
benzinger said that research by the americans shows that the us 
coast guard in hawaii received distress signals from the plane after 
it crashed and that the sos now had been pinpointed approximately to 
mckean and nikumaroro 
benzinger who has been in constant touch with the group said 
the expedition believes earhart and her navigator died from thirst 
or injuries some days after the crash the wreckage of the plane 
probably has been swept away by a hurricane he said 
mckean is a halfmile long about 800 yards wide and only 17 feet 
high nikumaroro also known as gardener has a rim of land a 
quartermilewide around its vshaped lagoon both islands are 
uninhabited 
benzinger said the expedition was equipped with diving gear and a 
sidescan sonar system which might detect wreckage of earharts plane

reputed medellin cocaine cartel money launderer 
eduardo martinez romero was flown wednesday night by us officials 
out of colombia bound for the united states an administration 
official disclosed 
drug enforcement administration spokesman frank shults said 
hes in the air coming into the united states sometime in the 
early morning 
martinez was flown out of bogota on a dea plane shults said 
shults did not say where the plane would land but the us 
marshal in atlanta lynn duncan said martinez was bound for atlanta 
all i can tell you is hell be at the federal building tomorrow 
thursday said duncan who added that he did not know what time 
martinez would appear in us district court 
martinez faces charges arising from an allegedly illegal 
moneylaundering operation 
duncan would not say where the airplane carrying martinez would 
land for security reasons i cant answer that right now said 
duncan 
martinez was arrested during the first weekend after colombia 
president virgilio barco launched a crackdown on drug traffickers in 
his country triggered by the aug 18 assassination of leading 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan an outspoken foe of the 
drug trade 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo quoted martinez after his arrest 
as saying he was innocent 
at no time have i had links to the medellin cartel and i dont 
know any of its members the newspaper quoted him as saying 
in the emergency measures imposed by barco was a reinstitution 
of the extradition agreement with the united states that had been 
thrown out by the colombian supreme court in 1987 
martinez 35 was indicted in march in atlanta as a result of an 
investigation codenamed operation polar cap that federal 
officials said revealed an operation that laundered billions of 
dollars in cocaine profits through us and foreign banks charges 
were brought against 127 people and two latin american as a result 
of that investigation 
drug traffickers in colombia who supply an estimated 80 percent 
of the cocaine consumed in the united states are said to fear 
extradition to the united states because they believe they will not 
be able to escape conviction and prison sentences 
in response to barcos crackdown the traffickers declared 
total war on the government and have carried out bombings and 
shootings in medellin home of the worlds largest drug cartel and 
the second largest city in the country and in bogota the largest 
and the capital 
the last trafficker to be extradited was carlos lehder a leader 
of the medellin cartel who was sent to the united states in early 
1987 and is serving as life sentence in the federal prison in 
marion ill 
the day the indictments were announced attorney general dick 
thornburgh said martinez was holed up in a bank in panama surrounded 
by the panamian defense forces who were there to arrest him 
however martinez escaped from the bank later in the day 
the panamanian defense forces are led by gen manuel anonio 
noriega who has been indicted in florida on drugtrafficking charges 
martinez was not on the list of the dozen most wanted colombians 
issued by thornburgh last month but he was already in custody at 
the time the list includes leaders of the medellin and cali cartels 
the us government responded to the outbreak of violence in 
colombia by sending 65 million equipment and other aid airplanes 
helicopters and vehicles as well as military advisers to the south 
american country 
in addition plans were accelerated to send some 25 million 
worth of help to protect colombia judges dozens of whom have been 
killed by drug gangs 
in his national drug control strategy announced tuesday night 
bush said military and law enforcement aid to the three main cocaine 
producing countries colombia peru and bolivia would increase 
from an estimated 53 million this year to 261 million next year 
the administration also promised an additional 2 billion over the 
following five years to the three countries if they demonstrated 
their comitment to cracking down on drugs 
we have a responsibility not to leave our brave friends in 
colombia to fight alone bush said

a state judge on wednesday granted an annulment 
to former metropolitan opera impresario sir rudolf bing over the 
objections of his mentally ill wife ending their 33month marriage 
the 87yearold bing who suffers from alzheimers disease and 
carroll douglass 50 had lost touch with reality their attorneys 
told judge carmen ciparick 
bing is in a nursing home and ms douglass is hospitalized in a 
psychiatric ward 
ciparick also denied ms douglass any part of the bing estate or 
alimony said her attorney harvey sladkus 
the judge ordered bings estate to pay the expenses for ms 
douglass hospitalization for mental problems last summer sladkus 
said 
i havent spoken with her yet but we can still go before the 
appellate court or make a motion to reappeal said sladkus ms 
douglass sister and brother in washington will also confer on the 
next legal move sladkus said 
bings attorney paul goldhamer said he was gratified by the 
judges decision but was sorry it took so long the annulment trial 
began in may 1988 and closing arguments were made march 15 
time is certainly not on sir rudolfs side goldhamer said 
its a great tragedy that could only have happened under these 
peculiar circumstances 
bings legal guardian paul c guth was on vacation and was not 
available for comment 
attorneys for bing the operas general manager for 22 years had 
claimed he was mentally incompetent and had no idea what he was 
doing when he married ms douglass on jan 9 1987 in a civil 
ceremony in arlington va 
almost half the couples marriage was spent in court 
during the annulment trial a psychiatrist testified that bing 
was suffering from alzheimers disease and did not recall being 
married 
ms douglass was hospitalized last august after she lost touch 
with reality her lawyer said 
goldhamer charged that ms douglass had abused her husband 
verbally and physically during the early part of their marriage 
ms douglass erratic behavior during the trial compelled 
ciparick to bar her from seeing bing for six hours each day 
earlier this year bing was forced to sell off a grandma moses 
painting worth more than 35000 to cover the cost of the nursing 
home 
goldhamer said his clients funds were depleted because bing had 
to hire guards to keep ms douglass away

back in the days when a sneaker was a smelly 
construction of canvas and rubber statisticians told us the typical 
american household had 25 children 
now thats the average number of pairs of athletic shoes owned 
by every man woman and teenager in the united states according to 
a nationwide study by a sportswear trade group 
the athletic footwear association said it also discovered that 
while some consumers are troubled by the escalating prices for 
athletic shoes comfort is still the top priority amid the spaceage 
designs and physicslab features that have pushed the prices of many 
top brands over 100 
for a long time and in the last 10 years in particular the 
whole idea about sneakers has heen evolving said gregg hartley a 
spokesman for the north palm beachbased group today its 
recognized that there are different sneakers for different sports 
but they can be fashionable too 
the sneaker revolution has also altered our vocabulary said 
hartley the generic sneaker has been replaced by classifications 
such as running shoes aerobic shoes and even mallwalking shoes 
just about the only thing called sneakers these days is a 799 
pair found in a discount store he said 
the sixmonth survey of 1200 people which began in november and 
was released tuesday by the footwear association which represents 
more than 100 manufacturers worldwide the survey had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 2 percent 
athletic shoe sales have grown about 15 percent a year and now 
comprise about 40 percent of the total footwear sales in the united 
states about half of the 9 billion us market is shared by nike 
inc and reebok international inc 
the study found that young black males are the top sneaker 
buyers with an average of 48 pairs adults 18 to 35 were next with 
an average of 41 pairs older adults owned 14 pairs on average 
men paid an average of 34 a pair and women spent 26 according 
to the survey 
although 83 percent of all respondents said comfort was the 
principal factor in buying an athletic shoe teenagers put fashion 
first

the government on wednesday put a 
250000 price tag on the heads of colombias top two reputed 
cocaine cartel bosses and a us official said a reputed drug 
financier was extradited to the united states 
eduardo martinez romero was flown wednesday night on a dea plane 
out of colombia bound for the united states said drug enforcement 
administration official frank shults 
hes in the air coming into the united states sometime in the 
early morning shults said from washington another us official 
said martinez was being flown to atlanta to appear before the us 
district court 
all i can tell you is hell be at the federal building tomorrow 
thursday said us marshal lynn duncan in atlanta 
us and colombian officials in bogota declined comment late 
wednesday on the reported extradition the first since colombia 
declared war on drug traffickers 2 weeks ago 
us officials in this capital speaking on condition of 
anonymity have predicted even greater bloodshed in this 
violencewracked country if anyone is extradited because the cartel 
has warned it would kill 10 colombian judges for each person sent 
out drug traffickers in particular fear extradition 
the last colombian trafficker to be extradited was carlos lehder 
a leader of the medellin cartel who was sent to the united states in 
early 1987 and is serving a life sentence in the federal prison in 
marion ill 
martinez 35 was indicted in atlanta as a result of an 
investigation codenamed operation polar cap that federal official 
said disclosed at least 12 billion in money laundering of cocaine 
profits through us and foreign banks 
martinez had faced summarry extradition under emergency measurres 
since his arrest aug 20 barco ordered his administrative 
extradition to the united states 
the justice ministry announced on national tv that the reward on 
pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha would be paid to anyone 
providing information leading to the arrest of one or both men and 
showed wanted posters of the two 
the television later reported without elaboration that martinez 
had been extradited 
escobar and rodriguez gacha now in hiding are also wanted in 
the united states both are said to be billionaires and were on the 
list of the 12 most wanted colombians that was issued last month by 
the us government martinez was not on that list 
the government also announced that under present emergency 
legislation in the fierce antinarcotics fight it can if necessary 
fire mayors and place cities under temporary military control this 
could happen a proclamation said in case of abnormal 
situations 
president virgilio barco on wednesday thanked president bush for 
backing colombia in its drug war but said the united states and 
other developed countries with lots of drug users have more to 
answer for than cocaineproducing colombia 
bush on tuesday night announced a 79 billion war on drugs and 
said specifically that colombia will get us antidrug aid 
this is a very favorable start barco said in a statement 
responding to bushs announcement 
colombia certainly needs international help so it can fight its 
own battle against internationally organized drug trafficking 
he added however that such help including possible military 
support mentioned by bush cannot be a substitute for the 
responsibility each nation has for controlling the various links in 
this criminal chain 
the colombian president said that ending drug use is a 
responsibility of the whole international community we hope that 
other countries assume the responsibility that corresponds to them 
a defense ministry spokesman in bogota said police and soldiers 
had made more than 2042 raids since aug 18 when barco invoked 
emergency powers after the assassination of sen luis carlos galan 
the leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the drug 
lords 
the united states has a list of 12 socalled extraditables 
the men said to be colombias most important drug kingpins all but 
economist martinez are at large cartel bosses said they would 
rather die in colombia than go to jail in the united states 
acting justice minister carlos lemos said wednesday this south 
american country cannot fight the drug barons successfully unless 
the united states the worlds biggest cocaine consumer curbs its 
appetite 
bush made the same point tuesday night 
the defense ministry said police and soldiers had seized 880 
properties including some palatial estates and hundreds of 
vehicles and aircraft in its war on narcotics traffickers 
police in medellin home of the most powerful cocaine cartel 
said they were searching for a couple suspected in the latest 
bombing in the cartels counterattack an explosion in a restaurant 
that injured four people including two us journalists 
colombians reacted favorably to bushs speech and the countrys

real estate believed owned by cocaine barons authorities had 
confiscated 1190 weapons more than 20000 rounds of ammunition

chinese prime minister li peng said his government 
cannot lift martial law because of lingering threats of subversion 
and infiltration from foreign countries a french newspaper reported 
wednesday 
in an interview with the conservative daily le figaro li said 
the peoples liberation army troops in beijing must assist police 
with the latent dangers from subversives and armed infiltrators 
li characterized the communist regime as stable and declared 
that china would continue reforms to modernize its economy despite 
sanctions imposed by western governments in response to the 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in june 
we think that these types of sanctions are harmful to the 
western countries also he was quoted as saying during the 
twohour interview friday if your capitalists want to lose the 
chinese market they can its their business 
the newspaper said li cited ongoing joint ventures with french 
and british firms as evidence that western investors have adopted a 
more realistic line toward china than their governments since a 
military assault june 34 ended six weeks of studentled protest 
against the communist party leadership 
li was quoted as saying that 185 percent annual inflation 
corruption in the party and uneven distribution of wealth led to the 
protests the government is taking measures to correct the 
imbalances and end nepotism he said 
but li asserted that dissatisfaction and rebellion should be 
separated le figaro said while suggesting clemency for 
demonstrators not involved in looting arson homicide or violence 
against the military li ruled out a general amnesty it said 
dismissing western condemnation of human rights violations 
committed during the crackdown li accused two of his leading 
critics france and the united states of ignoring human rights 
during different periods in their histories le figaro said 
before the arrival of the europeans there were indians in 
america li was quoted as saying where have they gone now they 
have been parked on reservations for those people where are human 
rights 
li also accused television of distorting the truth especially in 
the widely viewed image of a lone man blocking a column of tanks on 
a peking street 
this image made president bush say that this man was really 
extraordinary li was quoted as saying but there is another 
explanation if we examine this scene objectively doesnt it 
demonstrate the humanity of the chinese army and record the 
gentleness of the commander 
as if a man could stop a tank by himself

a stateforced cutback in a program for 4000 
mentally retarded philadelphians living with relatives threatens 
them with the prospect of regression and institutionalization 
the city argued in court wednesday 
state officials countered that they merely allocate money that 
the legislature provides in this case a 75 million shortfall in 
the states allocation for a city program of vocational education 
day care and therapy 
commonwealth judge james crumlish jr did not say when he would 
rule on the citys request for an injunction against gov robert 
casey and public welfare secretary john white 
the citys lawsuit contends that until the programs are restored 
the retarded will suffer irreparable harm and risk regression 
and possible institutionalization 
we contend that state law provides that those persons who got 
the services before should continue to get them said deputy city 
solicitor richard gold said 
leona fialkowski was one of two mothers who testified that the 
cutback already has hurt their children 
we are starting to see regression in david in his efforts in 
walking and selfhelp said the woman whose son is 27 he needs 
attention to maintain what he has 
the city successfully challenged a state cutback in court last 
fiscal year but earlier this year a federal appeals court held 
that the us constitution does not give the retarded the right to 
the same level of treatment provided institutionalized patients 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals court acknowledged that its 
ruling could force more people into hospitals at greater cost to 
taxpayers 
according to testimony at wednesdays hearing about 20 million 
of a total of 120 million for the state was allocated to 
philadelphia by state law the state must pay 90 percent of the 
cost of services for the retarded 
assistant attorney general gwen mosley representing the 
defendants said she does not doubt philadelphia needs more money 
but questioned whether the city is entitled to it under the law 
we say it is not she said we can allocate only what is 
appropriated by the legislature and we must distribute it fairly 
joseph gueltier director of the state bureau of mental 
retardation said philadelphia has about 14 percent of the states 
total population and is getting about 18 percent of the money 
allocated for nonresidential programs 
attorney david ferleger disagreed these people have the right 
to these services and the state must fund it he said the 
state has intentionally underfunded philadelphia year after year 
after year 
ferleger represents the philadelphia police and firemen 
association for handicapped children which joined the citys 
lawsuit 
if crumlish rules for the city ferleger said he will ask the 
judge to expand the program to all retarded people living at home in 
philadelphia affecting an additional 3800 
we aim to give people with retardation and their families a 
chance to have a normal life in their own homes instead of being 
forced by the state into large institutions which will be the result 
if the shortfall continues he said 
nobody needs an institution when they can live in their own 
home 
the expansion would cost the state 30 million ferleger said

director of the national hurricane center 
we have a very large wind field around this hurricane sheets

with precision but said it appeared the hurricane would graze 
bermuda by friday with tropical stormstrength winds 
they may not get the core of it at all but they are already 
getting 15 to 20foot swells he said theyll get some 
showers some winds and definitely some surf problems 
minor flooding was reported in beachside areas of the eastern 
caribbean island of barbados as gabrielle passed tuesday 
meanwhile far to the north felix maintained its status as a 
minimal hurricane with winds of 75 mph the storm was drifting 
slowly out in the atlantic and was no threat to land forecasters 
said 
at 1030 pm edt felixs center was near 375 degree north 
latitude and 475 degrees west longitude or about 850 miles from 
the westernmost azores 
satellite pictures indicated that felix was drifting toward the 
north northeast at less than 5 mph 
felix was the sixth and gabrielle the seventh named storms of the 
1989 atlantic hurricane season storms are named when their winds 
reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when they grow to 74 
mph

president bush is embarking on a public 
relations campaign to sell his block by block child by child 
war on drugs but democrats complain the 79 billion program 
doesnt go far enough and relies on cuts in other federal programs 
for financing 
in his first primetime address to the nation tuesday night the 
president held up a bag of crack seized across the street from the 
white house and declared drugs the gravest domestic threat facing 
our nation but he said we can pay for this fight without 
raising taxes or adding to the budget deficit 
bush called for expanded treatment and education programs but he 
also urged the country to demonstrate zero tolerance for casual 
drug use and repeated his support for harsh penalties on users as 
well as dealers

researchers found reassuring evidence that birth 
control pills havent raised the breast cancer risk for middleage 
women now they are starting a major new study to see if thats 
true for a younger generation

women now in their mid40s and 50s typically began using the pill 
when they were in their mid20s or beyond 
since then however millions of american women have begun taking 
the pill while still in their teens troubling data has begun to 
emerge that these people may be at substantially higher than usual 
risk of breast cancer

four illustrators and a historian are 
capturing the flavor of plains the friendly town that gained world 
renown in 1976 when americans elected a peanut farmer to serve as 
their 39th president 
under a program known as the historic american building survey 
the five have been working since june 12 studying and sketching 
historic buildings that eventually may be included in the jimmy 
carter national historic site 
its a privilege to work on this project said architect john 
westberg of tempe ariz hes making a difference on this planet 
he seems less concerned about his own life than what he can do for 
other people 
westberg 35 the teams leader said residents have been helpful 
and seem to appreciate the efforts to preserve the towns heritage 
the five were chosen from hundreds of applicants and are paid by the 
national park service their headquarters is an apartment next to 
the one carter and his young wife rosalynn rented in 1953 when he 
returned from the navy 
they have attended sunday bible classes given by the former 
president and met with the carters at the couples home on church 
street theyve spent weeks taking precise measurements of carters 
high school his boyhood home in nearby archery a former store 
operated by the carter family the apartment and the centuryold 
depot that served as carters 1976 campaign headquarters 
the park service already owns the depot and high school but is 
negotiating for the boyhood home and store the carters have donated 
their home but will continue to live in it 
from photographs and sketches westberg and three others will 
prepare detailed ink drawings of the five buildings for the national 
archives the carter home was not included in the building survey 
it takes a lot of care said dana peak as she inked a 
cornice of the high school the drawings may be scrutinized by a 
lot of people westberg said its very important that they be 
accurate 
ms peak a june graduate of the university of california davis 
said theres a strong feeling of community in the sumter county town 
of 650 the people have been friendly and supportive 
the people are very enthusiastic about the jimmy carter 
historic site agreed architect jason breyer 25 of fargo nd 
dale waldron 21 of preston conn a student at the rhode 
island school of design said he welcomed an opportunity to meet the 
former president i found him very open hes very visible he 
goes to a lot of meetings 
the fifth team member historian elizabeth barthold of crofton 
md spends her time interviewing residents and wading through real 
estate records at the sumter county courthouse in americus 
people here are really proud of plains and they want to 
share she said they feel it is special and theyre interested 
in having it recorded 
ms barthold is preparing reports on 23 historic buildings in 
plains including the five that are to become a part of the national 
historic site she also is studying a pond house that belonged to 
miss lillian the presidents mother a former hospital where carter 
was born and a service station made famous by the presidents late 
brother billy carter 
at first i was so amazed that jimmy carter president of the 
united states came from here but the carters are just incredible 
people 
ms barthold was impressed by the functional design of the old 
homes they sit on brick pillars for ventilation and protection from 
moisture many have high steep roofs high ceilings and hallways 
running through their entire length for more efficient cooling on 
hot summer days 
westberg said the high school is typical of hundreds built during 
the 1920s with a central entrance wings on each side and an 
auditorium in the back 
its disintegrating fast he said water has gotten into 
the outside walls and its rotting the floor and ceiling away 
the park service runs a museum in the depot and has earmarked 
200000 to preserve the high school about 4000 tourists visit the 
town each month just a fraction of the multitudes who flocked here 
during the carter presidency 
westberg and the others will remain in plains through friday all 
their work including rough sketches ink drawings and reports will 
become a part of the official history of plains maintained by the 
national archives

tarnation thars bat and wyatt and young 
maverick and the riflemans son and a whole passel of western stars 
on the twohour season premiere of paradise on cbs 
i was very excited about playing bat masterson again after 25 
years said gene barry who comes to the rescue of ethan allen 
cord lee horsley with hugh obrian returning as wyatt earp 
the twohour show on sunday is a roundup of old western stars 
barry played the canecarrying dandy in nbcs bat masterson from 
1959 to 61 obrian was the dodge city marshal on abcs the life 
and legend of wyatt earp from 1955 to 61 
the western also stars jack elam of abcs the dakotas in 1963 
and nbcs temple houston in 196364 johnny crawford who was 
mark mccain on abcs the rifleman from 1958 to 63 charles 
frank who was on cbs the chisholms in 1979 and cbs young 
maverick in 197980 and charles napier of nbcs the oregon 
trail in 1977 and cbs the outlaws in 198687 
the cast gives new meaning to old west the exception is john 
schneider of the dukes of hazzard hes along for the ride by 
horse instead of gravelspraying roadster playing sheriff pat 
garrett the man who killed billy the kid 
in paradise the over the hill gang comes to the rescue 
after horsley is thrown into jail on trumpedup murder charges 
were a little clumsy at what we did so well 30 years ago 
says barry 67 i hope to see it come off because there could be a 
future in bat and earp its a lovehate relationship like between 
quirt and flagg in what price glory two old guys who fight and 
carry on ive always felt theres a movie in it 
although bat masterson and wyatt earp both operated in dodge 
city the twain never met on television since they were on 
different networks 
i would have had him on my show barry said he had his own 
bat masterson but he guarded his show with his buntline special 
barry also stars in the nbc movie repeat performance which 
will be telecast in december 
the movie a remake of a 1947 film stars connie sellecca as a 
woman who kills her husband at midnight on new years eve and 
discovers she can relive the previous year she knows whats ahead 
but can she change the climax 
barry plays her business manager and the story is told through 
his eyes 
the remake barry is pressing hardest for is burkes law the 
abc series 196366 in which he played a millionaire homicide 
detective who drove to the murder scene in a rollsroyce he hopes 
to see it turned into a series of movies similar to perry mason 
barry also starred in name of the game in rotation with 
robert stack and tony franciosa on nbc from 1968 to 71 
he recalled that when bat masterson first came up 30 years 
ago he didnt want to do it 
then someone said he wore a derby hat and carried a cane he 
said that appealed to the actor in me if it hadnt been for that 
i would have turned it down i didnt want to be tied down doing a 
western i went to wardrobe and found the hat and cane and an 
elegant swallowtail coat and shiny black boots 
i looked at myself in the mirror and i knew exactly how to play 
this man the costume dictated my performance it changed my life 
every role ive done since has been a guy who looked good in 
clothes 
it was his stint on broadway as georges in la cage aux folles 
that he calls the highlight of my life he was in new york for 
three years and then spent another year on the road in the french 
farce about a gay couple pretending to be straight for the sake of 
georges son his fiancee and her parents 
when the role came up it wasnt a surprise because every year 
id do a play or take off with my oneman musical revue gene barry 
in one he said id try to get back to new york for a musical 
now and then that was my repeat performance thats where i 
started on the musical stage

the most obnoxious show on television 
is over 
for two years the morton downey jr show raised eyebrows ire 
and to a certain extent social conscience he also made people 
laugh 
his show filmed at a new jersey television station studio 
attracted adoring live audiences who appreciated downeys 
noholdsbarred style 
guests knew they would be subjected to a verbally and sometimes 
physically abrasive opinionated downey screaming inches away from 
their faces 
but stations that aired the syndicated show might have grown 
weary of hitting the bleep button and advertisers apparently were 
wary of appearing between segments of downeys talk show without 
enough consistent advertising it was axed the last original show 
airs sept 15 
to many television critics the cancellation is not a great loss 
others say downey blazed the trail for shock television 
the tradition of someone saying controversial things goes back 
a long way in radio mort downey just passed beyond some previous 
standards said george comstock a public communications professor 
at syracuse university 
downeys strong following began to deteriorate as he became 
more abrasive than he could handle with good humor comstock said 
the show began to slide from controversial but real to 
ludicrous puton 
downeys reputation was not helped by the complaints and lawsuits 
filed against him and his show in april 1988 downey was acquitted 
on charges that he slapped a gayrights activist 
in august of that year the editor of a weekly newspaper in 
connecticut filed a complaint that downey scuffled with him during a 
show four months later downey was sued by a pennsylvania radio 
personality who claims downey assaulted him during a live panel 
discussion on gun control 
most controversial was downeys allegation that a group of 
skinheads attacked him in san francisco airport skepticism arose 
when a former associate said downey had been planning a press stunt 
to boost his shows ratings 
jane marion a tv guide associate editor who has interviewed 
downey several times said that in reality downey is an extremely 
likeable man even he is tired of this persona he created i dont 
want to say he sabotaged his own show but he was ready to move on 
and he appealed only to a certain segment of the television 
audience 
downey agrees that being morton downey was hard work albeit 
satisfying 
it was tiring for me to always be the aggressor he said 
never again though i put a new pane of glass into television 
and i may have actually thrown a hardball through it but ill leave 
it alone and put in another pane somewhere else 
downeys unique talk show started out as a cult cable television 
item in 1987 and soon advanced to the masses via syndication in 
1988 
it was a quick burst like a comet said howard rosenberg a 
television critic for the los angeles times to me he was the 
extreme i predicted from the beginning that he would be gone within 
two years 
ms marion said that downey came on the air like a steam train 
it was trendy tv and trends are born and die just as quickly 
rosenberg found downeys show offensive and dangerous not 
because of the ideas he espoused but because of the volatile 
environment he fermented im glad he went off the air before 
anything dangerous happened 
van gordon sauter former executive vice president of the cbs 
broadcast group and former president of cbs news said downey was 
a superb showman 
but his concept was predicated upon hostility and after a 
period of time hostility becomes debilitating for the host and the 
audience sauter said his show was an oddity at first hostile 
shows tend to be aberrations on television 
comstock said that downeys show restored some legitimacy to 
tabloid television by suggesting there are limits 
but sauter said the shows cancellation has nothing to do with 
its standards but rather with whether the audience felt comfortable 
with the environment 
downey himself thought his fans saw the humor in the show the 
entertainment value they could see the smile on my face 
apparently not enough did 
the cancellation was kind of fortunate downey said it 
just spins me off into another area 
downey said his company is working on a sitcom called thats my 
dad featuring himself as one of the leads 
he also said he is working on a new talk show with a new 
structure that would absolutely work it would be radical but not 
offensive 
sauter thinks that would be seen as a charade and it too would 
flop 
a kinder gentler mort he said chuckling

dont gamble invest 
that admonition surely has a familiar ring for anyone who has 
ever devoted much study to the art of managing money 
but like a lot of other timehonored advice it often goes 
unheeded indeed the distinction between the two activities is 
often misunderstood 
one definition of gambling is any financial venture based on a 
risk for example the spin of a roulette wheel or the weekly 
drawing in a state lottery that is created solely for the purpose 
of betting 
investment by contrast is a venture based on a risk that 
already exists for instance the question of whether a company 
whose stock is publicly traded will prosper or languish in the 
future 
invested money can and often does help create wealth with a 
multiplier effect enriching both those who put it up and those to 
whom it is entrusted for use 
gambling by contrast generally rewards winners only be 
redistributing to them money from the losers in the game 
the easiest way to differentiate them is to understand that 
gambling is a zerosum game while investing is a positivesum 
game says sheldon jacobs who recently examined the subject in 
his newsletter the noload fund investor 
parimutuel betting lotteries roulette craps and many other 
casino games are zerosum games in each of these cases there is a 
finite pool of money bet there must be losers to pay the winners 
and since there are costs to all games gambling is really a 
negativesum game somebody has to pay the overhead at the casinos 
and the tracks it is the small player who usually winds up paying 
most of it 
for most individuals playing most games skill is not a 
sufficient factor to beat the house edge 
of course in the investment world the house usually takes a cut 
too whether it comes in the form of a brokerage commission price 
concession or mutualfund management fee 
as paul merriman a seattlebased investment adviser observes 
all those megabuck skyscrapers owned by banks and insurance 
companies were not built on thin profit margins and small 
commissions 
but money invested in things such as stocks bonds mutual funds 
and bank accounts can still bring benefits for all concerned 
in simplest terms says jacobs if one person buys a stock at 
20 sells it at 30 and the buyer sells it at 40 both win 10 
are all investments conservative and safe hardly even 
supposedly lowrisk vehicles like us treasury bonds can cost their 
owners plenty in buying power if inflation and interest rates 
increase 
perceptions of comparative risk however dont often square with 
reality 
consider the individual who wouldnt dream of gambling 5000 
in the stock market but who uses 10 in pocket money each week to 
play the state milliondollar lottery game 
after five years this person will have invested 5200 in 
the lottery with the strong likelihood of a 100 percent loss 
the probability of success in a stock investment is inherently 
unknown but even if the stock market fell 89 percent as it did in 
the 192932 disaster the results with a 5000 investment would not 
be as bad as those of the typical lottery player 
there is nothing wrong with occasional bets for 
entertainment jacobs concludes but the real way to win the 
lottery of life is to save a dollar and invest it wisely

in president bushs renewed war on drugs 
theres no political argument about the enemy the objective or even 
the weapons but partisan skirmishes already are flaring over 
priorities price and the way to pay for it 
stripped to essentials there really is no republican way to 
combat the drug menace and no democratic way the argument between 
the parties which means between the white house and congress is 
over how fast and how much 
and it also is over new taxes bush says no the democrats say 
the cost of the drug war means at least maybe 
political infighting about the war on drugs probably was 
inevitable it is ranked atop the current list of voter concerns it 
figured in the last campaign and it may be the common denominator 
issue in next years congressional elections 
bush saw it coming but those who judge our strategy only by 
its price tag simply dont understand the problem he said in his 
tuesday night address to the nation lets face it weve all seen 
in the past that money alone wont solve some of our toughest 
problems 
the bush strategy points to a guns and butter sort of a war 
although the president said that there would be hard times and high 
costs ahead he said he wants to add 22 billion to the war on 
drugs in budget terms all but 716 million already is included in 
proposals the administration has sent to congress the white house 
would offset that by cutting other programs one at the pentagon 
the rest on the domestic agenda 
we can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxes 
or adding to the budget deficit bush said 
sen joseph biden of delaware who delivered the democrats 
televised response said the bush plan would wage a limited war on 
the cheap we dont oppose the presidents plan said biden who 
as chairman of the senate judiciary committee wields legislative 
power over major portions of it all we want to do is strengthen 
it 
while the president asked support and commitment of a united 
angry america he did not spell out costs in terms of sacrifice 
that word turned up in a public opinion poll conducted as part of 
the buildup to the drug report george gallup jr said the survey 
found a majority of the public ready to accept sacrifices as in 
wartime including higher taxes if necessary to combat drugs 
house speaker thomas foley said the drug war eventually will lead 
to increasing pressure for a tax increase even rep robert h 
michel the republican leader said there might have to be another 
look at financing for the program after a year 
that flowed into the debate over the budget the deficit and the 
taxes bush ruled out in every speech of his campaign for the 
presidency that continuing struggle may embroil facets of the drug 
program just as it threatened to snarl the legislation bailing out 
the shaken savings and loan system 
bush said congress should offer leadership and bipartisan support 
to the strategy it asked the new president to prepare in the first 
place and our citizens deserve cooperation not competition a 
national effort not a partisan bidding war he said 
in his televised response biden proposed sharp spending 
increases in a halfdozen pieces of the drug war bush outlined he 
didnt give a total price tag nor did he suggest a way to pay for 
it he has suggested higher liquor and cigarette taxes as a source 
of drugfighting revenues 
the drug debate this fall will be in congress next fall it will 
be nationwide as the candidates of 1990 make the issue part of 
their campaigns for seats in a new congress 
in campaign settings the debate over drugs usually centers on 
wholl be tougher and more effective in fighting them thats the 
way it was when bush and gov michael dukakis dealt with drugs in 
their 1988 presidential campaign 
while there are differences over the proper mix between 
punishment and drug education and treatment the issue is not one on 
which parties or politicians can pick clearly opposing sides so 
they argue about who can do better with the weapons both political 
sides support 
in his 22minute nationally televised speech bush said the new 
attack he envisions can succeed where others have failed because it 
will mobilize all the nations resources in a coordinated drive 
against drugs the basic weapons we need are the ones we 
already have he said what has been lacking is a strategy to 
effectively use them 
the democrats agree on the weaponry indeed the major elements 
of the drug war were summed up in one sentence of the democratic 
party platform a summer ago it was a very long sentence 105 
words to be exact 
but they dont necessarily agree that the administration strategy 
is the best way to deploy those weapons 
bush may gain the united front he seeks but it will come after 
the political debate not before it

in an economy without crises americans might feel 
that something was missing something wasnt right something unseen 
and ominous lay in the future and that something was about to 
happen 
that mood in itself might end the crisis shortage since it might 
soon be documented as a decline of consumer confidence but rarely 
do most americans have to invent crises experts create a steady 
supply for them 
so far this year the experts have warned of recession inflation 
rising interest rates and a stock market collapse and the probable 
reason for their recent reticence is that they too need an 
occasional rest 
that a recession would occur seemed a very safe bet as the year 
began since the expansion was 6 years old and looking rheumatic 
that borrowing costs would rise seemed an equally safe forecast as 
well 
the experts gave the rationale with unemployment down to just 
over 5 percent the pool of productive workers was depleted and 
that meant producer costs would rise producers would pass on the 
expense to consumers 
simultaneously statistics suggested that the economys 
productive capacity was being strained the factory utilization rate 
was up to 844 percent eightyfive percent became a magic figure 
beyond that would come inflation 
inflation and its buddy higher interest rates can as most 
people realize lead to recession and even the mere prospect of 
recession has been known to batter stock prices housing 
employment tax receipts confidence and more 
it was a crisis forecasters economy and they exploited it when 
the economy failed to overheat when recession failed to keep its 
appointment when the stock market reached a record high they went 
into a huddle 
they are there now studying the charts and graphs contemplating 
the possibilities of a financial debacle of a breakdown in trade 
with japan of a confrontation with europe over the coming of a 
common market there in 1992 
explanations for the crisis phenomenon are many and they seem to 
bridge the gap between the two disciplines of economics and 
psychology among them 
good times beget fears often expressed in the phrase this 
cant continue forever bad times also generate fears and those 
fears beget more the latter is one reason why recessions seem to 
grow on themselves 
forecasters must forecast because they are paid to do so 
success for a forecaster is in being first in being right and being 
successful 
success however isnt always determined by accuracy as 
subsequent events show many work for financial firms where success 
is determined by the amount of publicity and revenues generated 
often a poor forecast is forgivable but a dull one isnt in 
fact incorrect forecasts often are sufficient reason to offer still 
another revised forecast 
americans and probably most others too focus on shortterm 
economic information 
many of the statistical wiggles that occur by the day week 
month and even quarter are meaningless they might not even be real 
as subsequent revisions demonstrate but they service the 
crisisaday mentality 
in the mix of current economic events are ingredients sufficient 
to stir up a real crisis one of these days excesses eventually must 
be corrected for some of them debts and deficits for example 
eventually might be soon 
there is no assurance however that the forecasters will have 
warned us in advance when the stock market crashed in 1987 the few 
who had foreseen events were praised they were rarities for being 
right

although modern society regularly is portrayed as 
becoming more secularized and less religious the hard data dispute 
it 
results of a new study provide some added rebuttal in regard to a 
group almost invariably pictured as abandoning the faith of past 
eras young people particuarly college kids 
theyve relaxed their views about sex but they havent shucked 
off religion 
to the contrary the new findings are that 80 percent of them 
consider religion important in their lives and 55 percent had 
attended worship services once or more in the month preceding the 
survey 
even more 72 percent had attended worship services in the 
previous six months half of them said they read the bible at least 
occasionally only 20 percent termed religion not very 
important a tiny 23 percent called themselves atheists 
the figures gathered by pollster george gallup jr for the 
christian broadcasting network indicate a remarkable continuing 
strength of religious concern among the young 
that steadiness has turned up across the board in research data 
on the religious pulse of america 
in a new book 100 questions and answers religion in 
america published by gallups princeton nj religion research 
association he reviews current findings of high religious 
involvement and says 
in 50 years the nations social order has undergone rapid and 
profound transformations with little effect on measures of personal 
faith 
in an earlier 57page report religion in america 50 years 
summarizing findings for that period about religion he says the key 
word for it is stability 
basic religious beliefs and even religious practice today 
differ relatively little from the levels recorded 50 years ago he 
writes 
this also is documented in other recent books including 
religious indicators in which the rev andrew greeley 
priestsociologist and novelist summarizes survey findings over the 
last half century 
he concludes that the pattern generally shows steadiness rather 
than change or decline another book unsecular america 
published by erdmans offers a similar accumulation of data 
however the thesis persists among both religious and 
nonreligious commentators that religion is in decline giving way 
to secularism materialism scientism and hedonism 
greeley arrays figures over the years showing that beliefs in 
basic doctrines church attendance prayer organizational 
affiliation and activity have changed little since the l940s 
he says the data simply dont back the conventional wisdom of 
many elite americans that the country is sinking into secularism 
he says that view is propagated either by people who broke with 
their childhood religion and need to think what they did accords 
with the march of history or by religious leaders who do it to urge 
a return to past piety 
the secularization model which has never been confirmed by the 
data and has often been disproved nonetheless remains as strong 
as ever in scholarly and journalistic circles unshaken and 
apparently unshakeable he says 
the recent gallup poll involving questionnaires completed by 539 
students at 100 colleges across the country found that religious 
concern remains high but views of sexuality and family life have 
changed 
twothirds of the women said their ideal life would include 
marriage children and also a fulltime job while only 9 percent 
envisioned an ideal life as being married and staying home with 
children 
this apparently reflected influence of the feminist movement 
among modern young women who find the old homemakermother image 
insufficient least attractive just 1 percent was fulltime 
homemaker with no children 
compared to adult women in general of whom only about half 
prefer to combine marriage with a career 78 percent of college 
women have that dualrole goal 
only 24 percent of college students nationally consider 
premarital sexual relations wrong only two years ago the 
proportion disapproving was 27 percent on the college level and 46 
percent among adults generally 
students in the east were found much less likely to disapprove of 
premarital sex only 11 percent than those in the midwest south 
and west where the proportion ranged from 25 to 30 percent 
half the students said they engage in sexual intercourse at least 
occasionally others said seldom 10 percent rarely 14 percent 
or never 24 percent 
while the majority took a flexible attitude toward premarital 
sex they nevertheless overwhelmingly affirmed fidelity in marriage 
ninetyeight percent said its important for a married couple to 
remain faithful and have sex only with each other 
catholic students whose church rejects divorce were more likely 
to approve divorce 76 percent than protestants 63 percent

relationships between jews and christians have 
changed from boundless prejudice to mutual respect says 
rabbi wolfe kelman in taking a new post that worksto advance 
interfaith understanding 
kelman retired as longtime executive secretary of the rabbinical 
assembly representing conservative rabbis was named director of 
the institute for religious and social studies at the jewish 
theological seminary of america 
in contrast with past antagonisms kelman says the different 
faiths now learn from one another and accept one anothers own 
definition of faith instead of viewing one another as candidates 
for proselytization 
this is taken for granted by the major christian and jewish 
denominations he says yet the horizon is also clouded with 
portents of violent fundamentalism murderous extremism and smug 
separatism

death dropped in at the blue banjo one 
sunday and nobody even noticed 
richard obennick and frank woodworth lay by the back steps for 
more than six hours on a 90degree day before anyone realized they 
werent asleep 
two nights later the jukebox blared a johnny cash song about a 
dallas bordello a haggard group of men lounged in the alley behind 
the blue banjo talking and sharing a jug on the sidewalk out front 
drug deals went down 
business as usual 
inside a couple of mexican farmworkers played pool on a ragged 
blueslate table a halfdozen men sat at barstools laughing once 
in a while and trading jokes with the bartender 
a blonde woman with a bandage wrapped around her hand and missing 
a front tooth danced a little as she walked from the jukebox to her 
table a man strutted behind her mimicking she turned and swiped 
him on the shoulder they laughed 
obennick and woodworth used to come in when they had cash 
they certainly take these fellows money readily enough and 
give them alcohol theyre friends as long as they have money 
said roger phillips who runs the 100bed union gospel mission 
robert maclemore a cook across town at the blue ox restaurant 
and obennicks sometime drinking buddy took a seat at the orange 
formicatopped bar he would go up and try to bum for money and i 
got to know him he would always be glad to see me coming he knew i 
always had money on me you see 
maclemore last saw obennick the wednesday before he died and 
gave him all of his bus fare so the transient could buy a quart of 
beer maclemore walked to work obennick was a nice person he 
really was but he was lonely he had something down inside of him 
that was eating him away he said 
obennick had a lot of good in him said phillips whose 
mission was the dead mens last address he always carried a 
trombone around and talked about playing it though phillips never 
actually saw him blow a note 
maclemore remembered woodworth as a quiet heavyset man who 
walked around on crutches and loved to drink wine he was older 
well he looked old but he wasnt as old as i am he was in his 
late 40s maybe early 50s 
after two autopsies and tests for poison the cause of 
obennicks and woodworths deaths on aug 6 remains a mystery the 
mens bodies sat in the latesummer heat a jug of almaden blush 
chablis between them long enough to start decomposing before 
anybody knew they were dead 
yakima county coroner leonard birkenbine wasnt surprised you 
go down there theres always somebody lying down like that 
the tavern with a blue neon sign thats read lue banjo as 
long as anyone could remember is in the tough section of yakima a 
central washington town of 50000 that is best known for apples 
cherries and vineyards but is fast developing a reputation as a 
rural drug center 
in a block wedged between a residential district and a restaurant 
strip are the blue banjo another tavern and a longvacant building 
with barred doors 
we did have an extensive problem some time ago down there 
said police capt don blesio for the most part the problem has 
been reduced considerably but were suffering from the cocaine and 
heroin problems that exist 
its tough there it really is maclemore said you can get 
hurt there you can get killed there 
bob briggs who said he was released from the washington state 
penitentiary in walla walla that day after serving eight years for 
burglary and auto theft watched the blue banjo scene from the 
corner barstool 
i asked where the toughest place in town was and they told me 
the blue banjo so i figured id better come try it out he said 
it couldnt be any tougher than walla walla 
the bar is a popular spot patrons wander in some for draft beer 
at 50 cents a glass some for the twoforaquarter cigarettes in a 
cubbyhole behind the bar two shelves are filled with fortified wines 
like thunderbird md 2020 and jugs of white port obennicks 
favorite 
while maclemore and others talked about obennick and woodworth 
a young woman walked in and ordered a beer the bartender asked for 
identification and instead of producing a drivers license she 
lifted her shirt and exposed her breasts she was kicked out 
we get that all the time said the bartender a burly man 
with a gravelly voice who asked that his name not be used ive 
got to kick her out or the cops would bust me for promoting 
prostitution 
two men staggered in and tried to order beer they were kicked 
out too 
he was like that the bartender said of obennick as they 
lurched out 
the cash register rang almost constantly after the bartender gave 
last call at 1145 pm maclemore downed one for the road and walked 
out through the shifting crowd outside 
coke coca two men asked making little sniffing motions 
maclemore ignored them and walked to the back of the building 
where a lone man rummaged through a trash bin the homeless 
jugsharers had left the spot where obennick and woodworth died 
was empty

hailed as a firstrate concert hall but criticized 
as a multimilliondollar extravagance the new home of the dallas 
symphony orchestra is all agree a class act 
the morton h meyerson center designed by im pei and detailed 
down to its washroom faucets seats 2065 people some in 
secondlevel boxes costing between 10000 and 30000 with a 
99year lease if paid within five years tickets are extra 
its gala opening friday with performances by van cliburn 
mstislav rostropovich and leontyne price was breathlessly awaited 
by the arts community and the dallas symphony supporters who 10 
years ago began toying with the idea of a new home for the dallas 
symphony 
the opening of a major concert hall anywhere is a major event 
because its a shrine its a temple said matthew sigman 
associate editor for symphony magazine 
the center was conceived by a small group of symphony supporters 
who toured concert halls around the world for ideas in 1982 dallas 
voters approved a 286 million bond issue to help pay for the hall 
the rest of the original estimated cost of 495 million was to come 
from private donations 
the price tag has swelled through delays cost overruns and 
lavish extras to anywhere from 815 million to 108 million 
the 815 estimate includes construction costs for the symphony 
hall alone the 108 million estimate includes the land the 
building the organ an underground garage an adjacent park a 
commemorative sculpture and arch and overtime costs to finish the 
canopies over the stage add financing charges and the cost of a 
nearby garage that will be used by concertgoers and the tab rises to 
just under 200 million 
the city also will pay more than 2 million a year in annual 
maintenance and debt service 
pei designer of the john f kennedy library in boston and the 
east wing of the national gallery of art in washington was no 
stranger to the dallas skyline he had designed four buildings here 
before he was tapped for the project and he was not likely to do 
his first symphony hall on the cheap 
he designed the music hall as a rectangle sitting at an angle 
inside a square surrounded by segments of circles the dallas 
museum of art and the dallas skyline are visible through 6 million 
worth of glass panes that make a sweeping curve of the lobby there 
is a 4463pipe organ italian marble and artificially weathered 
limestone 
after he was commissioned in 1982 at a fee that would total more 
than 10 million pei told the developers that the 25000 square 
feet of land they had procured for the hall would not be enough the 
city began negotiations for more land nearby land that had 
escalated as much as 10 times in value when word spread that the 
hall was to be built there 
eventually the symphony center would require 260000 square 
feet at a total land cost of 161 million 
each new detail whether from pei or the city or the symphony 
drove up the cost those pushing quality had an ally in texas 
billionaire h ross perot who contributed 12 million to the 
project with the stipulation that if quality were sacrificed he 
wanted his money back 
perot also refused to hand over the money unless the center was 
named for morton h meyerson president of perots electronic data 
systems inc and a member of the group that first envisioned the 
hall 
when budget considerations threatened the thick wood paneling 
that pei wanted for the music chamber plaster and concrete were 
originally proposed leonard stone executive director of the 
symphony warned that the perot grant could be in trouble 
ross is expecting wood stone wrote in a 1986 memo to 
symphony president bill schilling and if ross found out that wood 
was excluded he would feel that we violated the spirit of the 
agreement we entered into when we accepted his gift 
wood it was more than 1100 panels of african and american 
cherry 918 trimmed with brass inlays in the music chamber another 
216 squares will grace the stage walls 
instead of brick and carpet in the lobby pei wanted marble and 
limestone limestone that had to be given an artificially weathered 
look before it was put in the hall 
the construction brought with it widely reported disputes among 
the architect the organ designer cb fisk and an acoustics 
expert russell johnson of artec consultants inc 
johnson downplays the disagreements one does not expect that 
an acoustical advisor a theater planning consultant and an 
architect are going to immediately agree on every detail he said 
we feel that the collaboration was very warm and very close and 
very successful 
in fights with the symphony johnson protested using filled block 
instead of poured concrete and protested reducing roof or ceiling 
thicknesses and installing vents in the auditorium floor the hefty 
construction is one factor he cites as essential to acoustical 
quality as was the decision to build a small scale hall 
other features of the dallas hall 85foot high music chamber 
movable canopies soffit in the upper levels and acres of special 
fabrics in the chamber are important to good acoustical design he 
said 
the quality of the acoustics wont really be known until the 
first note is played to an audience nonetheless johnson is not 
worried i have had a full nights sleep every night for the last 
seven months he said

paul kellys songs could take place anytime 
anywhere the 19th century in australia europe in the 1940s 
contemporary america 
bus trips history books and old girlfriends provide inspiration 
with his band the messengers kelly sings of love in vain mystery 
trains and hearts too big for the body 
his influences include rock n rollers chuck berry and lou reed 
bluesmen muddy waters and howlin wolf and author raymond carver 
whose short story so much water so close to home provides the 
title for kellys third album 
he definitely showed me how to write economically how to 
convey a lot of information in a short space kelly said of the late 
writer his voice often has the ring of true speech thats 
something ive tried to do with my songs 
his songs are often threeminute stories condensing days even 
years into just a few stanzas but if kelly believes in writing 
words that linger the melody he insists comes first 
i wouldnt want people to think of songs just in terms of the 
lyrics by making the words fit the melody you open your stories up 
to chance sometimes the melody is going to make your story go 
somewhere i dont sit to write a story in a song its usually the 
other way around 
he contrasts bitter lyrics and happy music singing 
everythings turning to white so sweetly that only careful 
listeners will pick up kellys rendition of carvers bitter story 
about a mans indifference to a young girls death 
myths are also important whether his own or someone 
elsespigeonjundamarra is based on a true story about an 
aboriginal resistance hero from the late 19th century who kills his 
former masters and heads for the hills kelly added his own twist 
he knew the country so well and had knowledge of this extensive 
cave system the musician said he was very hard to catch and 
became almost supernatural people believed he could never be caught 
by a white mans bullet it was surprising that the song turned 
out very short and was written from the point of view of the officer 
chasing him i started with a formal story in my mind the officer 
chasing him is just a fictional character there was certainly no 
officer omalley 
kelly born in australia grew up listening to rock n roll 
playing the trumpet and writing short stories by age 18 he was 
ready to take up the guitar and write songs 
i knew that i wanted to write so i was keeping a journal but 
it took me a couple of years before i actually wrote a song it was 
in f and g and sounded a bit like bob dylans percys song 
he began his career in 1976 working in bands in melbourne and 
gradually meeting the musicians who became the messengers steve 
connelly michael barclay peter bull and jon schorfield 
ive known steve and michael for a while because we all lived 
in melbourne for a stage and weve seen each other in bands kelly 
said 
i moved up to sydney in 1984 and we worked together as a trio 
that was also the time i met peter who was playing in another band 
at the time we made an acoustic record and michael sang on it 
he made a solo album post in 1984 but began to acquire a 
real following with gossip a double album released two years 
later that featured the messengers trains were there from the 
start last train to heaven recalls a time when trains were a 
symbol of unavoidable fate that could take away your true love 
forever or provide your escape to a better world 
its a symbol of death in dreams kelly added freud always 
listed one of the death symbols as a train i sort of unconsciously 
absorbed it i didnt realize it until later that i wrote so often 
about trains 
the ballad cities of texas was written on a bus one that 
pulled into dallas during the first american tour kelly sings with 
the deepest longing like a man saying goodbye 
i guess its like the kind of longing you have for something 
you feel is going to pass away he said you walk into dallas 
and you walk up to a building and touch it its solid seems like 
its going to be around for a long time but seeing it from a 
distance its like here today gone tomorrow 
dallas made a big impression on me the city seemed to shimmer 
with all the glass reflected its a song of mourning so beautiful 
but its going to go away

outside on yet another day when new york felt 
like seattle people ran with newspapers over their heads to fend 
off a summer shower but inside a manhattan museum others pondered 
a rain of umbrellas 
from the ceiling of the american craft museum about 30 artful 
umbrellas are suspended in the air a seeming snapshot of a 
freefall down a threestoryhigh stairwell all thats missing is 
mary poppins 
the exhibit has lured in many during a season that demanded a 
good umbrella more than 28 inches of rain fell from april to july 
double the norm 
i do think the timings been wonderful museum director janet 
kardon said but when its raining outside its quite cheery in 
here 
a rain of talent umbrella art was created by painters 
sculptors architects and ceramicists who were given white umbrellas 
and instructions to do as they pleased 
most painted whimsical designs but one artist fused an umbrella 
with a kindergarten chair another hung strands of string inside the 
frame to create an image of an umbrella that lets in rain and a 
third painted long knives and daggers for a creation called acid 
rain 
a fourth artist robbed her umbrella of its function its all 
frame no cloth and yet another from texas made an insideout 
umbrella that looked as if it had been through a tornado 
many visitors said they now will look differently at umbrellas 
and rain 
most people think depressing things about the rain but this is 
bright and wonderful almost childlike said sasha bergmann of 
santa barbara calif this makes me want to go home and paint my 
umbrella and then never use it 
adriana de freitas of rio de janeiro said the show was like a 
crazy rainy day they had a lot of fun with it 
the show at the museum until sept 24 will be at a university 
of chicago gallery early next year and then may tour the country 
said richard siegesmund director of the fabric workshop in 
philadelphia which organized it 
the fabric workshop asked patterson sims curator of modern art 
and associate director for art and exhibitions at the seattle art 
museum to create an exhibition living in seattle you are real 
conscious of the necessity of having an umbrella and you want 
umbrellas to be as cheerful as possible said sims who doesnt 
own one 
its a form of denial he said i just get a little wet 
umbrellas are an object that we often review in mundane 
fashion siegesmund said but if you think about it umbrellas 
can become an object of startling beauty and demand consideration as 
an art object 
but most of the exhibits can still do the job for which they were 
designed 
edward henderson from stony point ny took apart a small 
schoolroom chair to create a sort of umbrellachair one of the few 
exhibits not hanging from the ceiling it could serve as a childs 
allweather reading spot 
i wanted to make something that would be much more than just an 
umbrella said henderson a painter and sculptor i wanted to 
embellish it its very common to put paint on it so you just 
stretch it you cant take it that seriously but then i take my art 
very seriously 
claire zeisler a fiber artist from chicago didnt take her 
assignment seriously at all she said helpers at her studio 
thought of putting long strands of string inside her umbrella it 
doesnt mean anything you know except that its fun maybe theyre 
trying to upgrade umbrellas

the 1990 mazda mx5 miata is the best of two worlds fun and 
affordable 
that pretty well explains why road and track magazine calls it 
one of the worlds best cars and motor trend magazine calls it 
the best sports car buy in america 
introduced this summer the miata is this years auto success 
story dealers have long waiting lists of buyers who seem to just 
follow the carhauling trucks into showroom lots some buyers are 
putting down deposits just to get a miata next year 
the car buff books have splashed the miata all over their front 
covers and young and old alike seem taken with the little car from 
japan that looks like the lowslung 1960s sports cars from britain 
japanese carmaker mazda initially projected sales of 20000 
miatas this calendar year but demand is so large that spokesman 
fred aikins said more than 20000 may be delivered as the company 
cranks up production 
more than 5800 were sold in the first two months of sales 
aikins said next year sales of 40000 more are expected 
the miata test car with convertible top was well fun it 
handled nimbly making tight turns with ease 
the normally aspirated 16liter four cylinder engine scooted 
the car around with pep since the miata body is relatively 
lightweight the fivespeed manual transmission is the only one 
available at this time and went through its paces well 
still its no nissan 300zx in terms of top speed 1168 mph for 
the miata vs a fuel cutoff at 148 mph for the 300zx or 
acceleration 86 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph in the miata vs 
less than 7 seconds for the 1990 zx thats powered by a v6 engine 
but keeping in mind that the 300zx starts at 27300 while the 
miata starts at 13800 puts things in perspective 
the miata interior was your basic black the only color offered 
there are three exterior colors red white and blue 
instrument gauges were easy to read and there were few 
electronic gadgets windows roll down manually outside mirrors 
adjust manually the seats adjust manually and had a sturdy feel 
thank heavens 
the suspension is stiff in the miata so riders feel lots of 
bumps the amfm stereo with cassette player was average 
i noticed there was considerable road noise in the miata but 
that seemed to be part of its roadster charm 
the steering wheel had an airbag embedded in its center so the 
horn buttons were at the sides i hit them and sounded the horn a 
couple times accidentally 
behind the passengers is a small rear shelf watch when you put 
things there they tend to slide around and may even come sliding 
forward toward you 
the sun visors are itsy bitsy things that fold in half so theyre 
out of the way as the convertible top goes up and down 
the top itself is a breeze to maneuver just unzip the rear 
plastic window lay it down flat unlock the top two sides of the 
convertible top in front and down it goes 
mazda includes a vinyl padded boot for packing and securing the 
convertible top one problem with the convertible top is that it 
prevents you from going to an automatic car wash mazda warns 
against that in the owners manual there is an optional detachable 
hardtop that costs 1100 
another problem with the convertible top is that it has large 
side pillars by the back window which obstruct the view to the 
side and rearward the passengerside outside mirror helps make up 
for that blind spot 
fit and finish on the miata were admirable inside and out but 
the trunk with its little spare tire is pretty tiny maybe three 
bags of groceries will fit and thats if you ask them at the store 
to fill them no more than threequarters of the way 
mazda expected a pretty even split of single men and women buyers 
who have college education but so far there are slightly more men 
buyers than women aikins said 
median age was projected to be 32 but mazda finds plenty of 
older buyers too he said household income of target buyers is 
32000 a year he added 
because the miata is a new vehicle consumer reports magazine 
does not have owner complaints

as they struggled through a snowstorm toward a 
theater in a small town actress rosemary prinzs husband once said 
to her you dont care where you act do you 
youre right i dont was her answer then still is 
you give me a good play and a good part and bogalusa suddenly 
is like broadway says miss prinz 
right now miss prinz is happily studying the title role in 
driving miss daisy its such a beautiful play and wonderful 
part she says im thrilled to be doing it 
while julie harris is on a national tour in driving miss 
daisy through january miss prinz begins a busandtruck tour 
playing mostly onenighters in smaller cities in october in 
january she takes over from miss harris on the national tour which 
will last through april 
her husband jazz drummer joe patti may go with her on the tour 
as road manager 
some know miss prinz from tv soap operas especially as penny on 
as the world turns she has been in several broadway plays from 
the greyeyed people opposite walter matthau in 1952 to most 
recently tribute starring jack lemmon in 1978 
her acting career began at 16 with a tour of joan of 
lorraine when she played the kings mistress and diana barrymore 
played st joan 
as well as not minding tours she says im an actor who 
doesnt mind long runs i love keeping it fresh making it like ive 
never heard it before or said it before i find that very 
challenging 
i love peeling away the layers and finding all that richness 
underneath 
miss daisy the atlanta native who gains some insights from her 
chauffeur during the play has a rich personality for an actress to 
discover miss prinz says 
ted lange the bartender on televisions the love boat will 
play the chauffeur 
miss prinzs most recent role was the mother for 840 
performances of offbroadways steel magnolias which is set in 
a beauty parlor much was made of the fact that she broke mary 
martins record set in south pacific for the number of times 
getting her hair washed on stage i couldnt believe they were 
making such a fuss the actress says is that what i want to be 
remembered for 
during each performance of steel magnolias which is still 
running miss prinz also had her hair conditioned set dried under 
a dryer combed out and teased 
it was supposed to look like a blond football helmet she 
says if i had an audition or a party i sometimes had to wash it 
two or three more times a week and blow it dry my hair held up 
beautifully its been a long time in show business this hair 
as miss daisy who ages from 72 to 97 during the plays 26 
scenes shell wear a gray wig that means my hair will look

on a hot tv sound stage eric pierpoint was 
even warmer with his ears and the top of his head covered by a 
molded appliance that transforms him into a largedomed newcomer 
on fox broadcastings alien nation

light years away who joins the los angeles police hes teamed up 
with earthling detective played by gary graham for this new action 
drama based on the movie 
they took a mold of my head and sculpted this head cover he 
said it comes down to my cheeks and eyebrows it takes an hour 
and a half to get it on because it has to be blended around the 
edges it has to be just right with no wrinkles so that it 
photographs well 
its very hot and it muffles your hearing about 50 percent it 
puts you in your own little world you have to pay careful 
attention you hear little shuffling noises whirling around in your 
head 
pierpoint and graham were doing a scene in which they question a 
newcomer prostitute the sound stage was on the cramped second 
floor of an old warehouse in an industrial district of los angeles 
it was last used by cagney amp lacey 
the new series debuts monday on fox after 21 jump street as 
the two shows open a new night for the socalled fourth network the

alien nation pierpoint said i thought he wanted me for the 
earthling role when he said he wanted me to play george i said id 
have to see the movie again i said youre absolutely right i 
have to do george still its a bit of a stretch for me and i was 
very nervous about it 
doing this kind of a character is a risk ive needed some help 
to tell me when im too broad or too funny or too unreal some of it 
just comes from the things that happen were coming up with a lot 
of things when he gets a cold he blinks when hes tense his feet 
get sore he gets drunk on sour milk and when he makes love he hums 
weve gotten a lot of jokes around the set on that

arthur andersen amp co and price waterhouse have 
major hurdles to overcome if they are to form the worlds largest 
accounting firm but analysts say they expect the two will forge 
ahead with plans to merge 
the firms announced tuesday that they are continuing their 
exploratory merger talks which began about two months ago 
the two had hoped to reach agreement by early this month but one 
industry analyst said that given the complexities involved the 
lengthy talks are understandable 
whats clear is that the two firms desire to merge said 
james emerson publisher of emersons professional services review 
a bellevue washbased publication that follows the big eight 
accounting firms 
the question is whether they can mechanically put the deal 
together in a way that makes sense for their clients employees and 
partners he said i think the benefits are so significant that 
they will work out their differences and will agree to the 
merger in principle in the very near future 
the talks between andersen the nations no 1 accounting firm 
and price waterhouse the no 5 firm come against a backdrop of 
other mergers within the big eight 
ernst amp whinney has agreed to combine operations with arthur 
young amp co while deloitte haskins amp sells is joining forces with 
touche ross amp co 
on july 6 chicagobased andersen and new yorkbased price 
waterhouse announced that they had entered into 60 days of formal 
talks to explore the feasibility of mergering their worldwide 
operations 
in a joint statement tuesday price waterhouse chairman joseph e 
connor and andersen chief executive lawrence a weinbach said the 
initial period of discussion has been beneficial 
the executives said talks so far have concentrated on exploring 
a combination that would add value to client service capitalize on 
shared values of commitment to quality and provide enhanced 
opportunities to personnel of both firms 
andersen spokesman jack ruane and price waterhouse spokeswoman 
deborah rothschild both said they could not comment further because 
the firms had agreed to keep details of the discussions confidential 
some potential obstacles to a merger include how to reconcile the 
firms compensation and retirement systems and foreign operations 
as well as how to handle merging andersens very successful 
consulting business with price waterhouses analysts say 
andersens consulting partners are the most resistant to this 
merger said arthur bowman editor of the atlantabased bowmans 
accounting report 
andersen consulting is involved in dozens of joint ventures with 
international business machines corp to develop computer 
integration products for clients the computer maker is price 
waterhouses largest audit client 
ibm is a big question bowman said there are definite 
conflicts of interest that have to be resolved before they can do a 
merger 
federal securities and exchange commission rules bar an 
accounting firm from participating in joint ventures with one of its 
audit clients because of possible conflicts of interest 
bowman said partners in both firms had indicated to him that 
there was more work to be done than they realized but he said the 
merger could be worked out by the end of this month 
after 60 days if they didnt want to merge they would 
certainly have known that so at least they are moving forward 
bowman said 
bowman said the us justice department had started looking at 
the ramifications of an andersenprice waterhouse combination which 
would create the worlds largest accounting firm together they 
would have 5 billion a year in worldwide revenue which 27 
billion of that coming from us operations

american officials did not dispute japanese charges 
made during trade talks that us spending habits and the nations 
budget deficit are part of the cause of the bilateral trade 
imbalance 
the united states should save more cut its budget deficit and 
encourage longerterm thinking by its business leaders japanese 
officials told their american colleagues tuesday in talks on 
structural solutions to the japanese trade surplus 
american officials attending the talks said they would seriously 
consider japanese suggestions for improving us export 
competitiveness including a call for increased spending on 
workforce training and education and more emphasis on the longterm 
implications of business decisions 
japanese officials said the huge us budget deficit and low 
savings rate were major causes of the more than 50 billion 
bilateral trade imbalance 
economists say that when americans do not save enough to pay the 
us government budget deficit the government must borrow from 
foreigners including japanese who get the money to lend by selling 
goods to the us 
as long as americans prefer to buy japanese goods rather than put 
their money in the bank and japanese prefer to save their money 
rather than spend it the imbalance will continue the economists 
say 
american and japanese trade policymakers generally agree that 
barriers to specific products the focus of trade negotiations in 
the past now account for only a small part of the imbalance most 
of the imbalance is caused they say by macroeconomic factors such 
as savings rates and government spending patterns 
we agreed with a great deal with the suggestions of our 
japanese colleagues and hope they will take just as seriously our 
suggestions said richard mccormack undersecretary of state for 
economic affairs and the leader of the us delegation when our 
japanese colleagues said our savings rate is too low we were in 
total agreement with them 
in talks monday american officials told japan it should 
encourage people to spend rather than save streamline its 
complicated distribution system and loosen the tightknit business 
ties that often exclude newcomers 
the us officials stressed that talks on eliminating the 
structural causes of the trade imbalance dubbed the structural 
impediments initiative were expected to produce concrete results 
on both sides of the pacific 
mccormack said the united states had already established a 
working group to study the us savings rate he said some progress 
had been made in encouraging americans to save more raising the 
personal savings rate from 32 percent of the us gross national 
product in 1987 to 54 percent this year 
both japanese and us participants declined to comment on 
specific policy changes that might result from the talks which are 
slated to resume in washington nov 67 
we hope and expect some changes could be implemented before 
the interim report next spring mccormack said i myself am 
optimistic that these talks will result in tangible changes 
japanese officials who on monday were urged to increase public 
spending to improve the quality of life in japan and to end 
exclusionary business practices that limit entry into their markets 
were more reserved in their comments 
although we havent come up with any concrete answers to those 
questions raised by either side i think it was significant that 
each side has come to know the others point of view said 
michihiko kunihiro deputy foreign minister for economic affairs 
the response of japanese officials to the us recommendations 
was mixed 
construction minister shozo harada said the us call to increase 
the amount of japans land available for residential housing 
construction was realistic and urgent 
but finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told japanese reporters 
there is no need to obey the us calls 
hashimoto said the us tactical approach of emphasizing how the 
structural reforms they suggested would benefit japanese consumers 
put his government in the uncomfortable position of having to 
explain why such improvements cannot be done 
the us officials said the structural reforms they suggested 
would both reduce the trade imbalance with japan and give japanese 
consumers access to a wider variety of products at lower prices 
spending more on highways parks sewers and medical facilities 
in japan they said would improve the quality of life for ordinary 
japanese and redistribute the nations massive wealth 
the two nations turned to a structural approach to trade reforms 
after success in lifting trade barriers such as tariffs failed to 
eliminate japans huge surpluses with the united states and other 
industrialized nations

a rift between the machinists union and united 
airlines unionized pilots weakens the pilots chances of succeeding 
in their 675 billion bid to put 75 percent of the airlines parent 
in labors hands experts say 
unless all three of uniteds major unions participate in the 
proposed labormanagement buyout they are apt to lose to california 
investor marvin davis in the bidding war for ual corp analysts 
predict 
price alone is not going to be the whole story said edward 
starkman an airline industry analyst with painewebber inc what 
really makes this deal go or not is the cooperation of labor 
the rancor that some united mechanics and groundcrew workers 
previously expressed privately rose bitterly to the surface tuesday 
in a stinging statement from their union the machinists 
we are very skeptical that united airlines could survive in 
todays marketplace with the additional debt that would be placed on 
the carrier under this proposal particularly since the proposed 
purchase price far exceeds the value of the airline said john 
peterpaul general vice president of the machinists 
federal officials also have been concerned about airline buyouts 
financed with heavy loads of debt 
ual chairman stephen wolf was planning to discuss details of the 
managementlabor buyout in a meeting today in washington with 
transportation secretary samuel skinner according to the chicago 
tribune 
transportation officials have said they would consider leveraged 
airline buyouts case by case they have indicated that they might 
pull a carriers operating certificate if an extreme debt burden 
were to endanger its ability to run a safe operation 
although he said the enormous new debt is the machinists main 
concern peterpaul also said the union opposes any transaction as a 
means of staving off an unwanted takeover attempt the machinists 
representing 25000 of uniteds 70000 employees have supported 
recapitalization as a way to fight davis 
in a recapitalization to avoid takeover a company typically pays 
shareholders a large special dividend financed by borrowed money 
making it less lucrative for shareholders to sell their stock to a 
raider and leaving the company less attractive due to the new debt 
the machinist statement included a slap at the pilotmanagement 
cooperation that led to the 300ashare bid announced by the group 
friday 
it is apparent that uniteds management who has been locked in 
a long struggle with the air line pilots association for a new 
contract agreement is using this alpamanagement proposal to 
solve its problems with one union by passing the burden from 
stockholders to other employees peterpaul said 
he said the pilotmanagement bid was nearly 2 billion more than 
united is worth 
alpa spokesman hank krakowski said the pilotmanagement proposal 
which would create the nations largest employeecontrolled company 
is based solely on participation of uniteds 6300 pilots but he 
added it is our strong desire to have all employees on board this 
proposal 
the association of flight attendants which represents 12700 
united workers remains open to discussing participation in a 
buyout said spokeswoman patricia friend 
privately some machinists have said the pilots leaders are too 
close to management some bitterness also stems from the fact that 
pilots are paid more than machinists 
joseph blasi a professor at rutgers university in new brunswick 
nj said tuesday that an employeeowned company works better if 
all employees share in ownership 
the differences between pilots and machinists boil down to a 
disagreement about who is more important and who deserves higher 
wages said blasi who has written several books on employee stock 
ownership plans 
those differences blasi said can be resolved better together 
than with speculative takeover raiders 
peterpaul said the machinists had not been invited to participate 
in any discussions regarding the pilotmanagement proposal but that 
they were keeping their options open and would not hestitate to 
meet with the appropriate parties to discuss uniteds future 
the bid by the pilotmanagement alliance has financial backing 
from british airways plc 
if successful it would result in 75 percent employee ownership 
british airways would own 15 percent of the company and uals 
management led by wolf would hold 10 percent 
davis a billionaire who put ual into play last month with a 
240ashare offer that he later sweetened to 275 was reportedly 
seeking the help of foreign airlines in an attempt to outbid the 
insider group 
the new york times quoted an unidentified source in the davis 
camp as saying davis was talking with european and noneuropean 
carriers 
the davis group did not return telephone calls tuesday seeking 
confirmation of the report

a former executive of wall streets goldman sachs 
amp co has pleaded guilty to a felony mail fraud charge for trading 
on inside information 
the plea on tuesday by robert m freeman the former head of risk 
arbitrage at the prestigious investment house was part of an 
agreement with federal prosecutors announced aug 17 risk arbitrage 
is the speculative investment in stocks of possible takeover targets 
in entering the plea freeman became one of the most prominent 
people to plead guilty in the aftermath of the ivan boesky insider 
trading scandal that rocked wall street nearly three years ago 
freeman admitted that he used inside information when he ordered 
the sale of beatrice companies inc stock in january 1986 
i knew it was wrong at the time sir freeman told us 
district judge pierre leval 
he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison 186 
million in fines and additional restitution leval scheduled 
sentencing for nov 16 
the 47yearold securities professional read a sevenpage 
statement that detailed the events on which his guilty plea was 
based 
he said he received confirmation of a rumor from martin siegel 
then a vice president at kidder peabody amp co about a problem with 
the planned leveraged buyout of beatrice by the investment firm of 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
when martin siegel confirmed the rumor i did not believe that 
he was authorized by kkr to do so and i knew i was not entitled to 
trade on that information freeman said 
after the conversation on jan 8 1986 he said he ordered the 
sale of certain beatrice securities in a company account in a 
customers account and in his own personal account 
the government alleges that the sales resulted in the avoidance 
of 930000 in trading losses 
siegel who later worked for drexel burnham lambert inc was 
implicated in the wall street insider trading scandal by boesky now 
serving a threeyear prison term siegel pleaded guilty in february 
1987 to securities fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with the 
government 
he implicated freeman who was taken into custody at his office 
in front of shocked coworkers 
us attorney benito romano announced freemans plea agreement 
last month 
freeman resigned from goldman sachs before his plea agreement was 
announced he said in a letter to his employer that he decided to 
plead guilty to end what he called the nightmare that the 2year 
investigation had caused him and his family 
his plea agreement prohibits romanos office from bringing any 
additional criminal charges against freeman but does not preclude 
the securities and exchange commission from seeking civil penalties 
at the court proceeding leval asked assistant us attorney john 
mcenany how much restitution freeman faces 
mcenany said the exact figure had not been calculated but with 
prompting from the judge said it could go as high as 50 million 
freemans attorney robert b fiske jr said mcenanys 
estimation was off the wall fiske said freeman may only have to 
pay back 466000 which is the amount of losses he personally 
avoided in the transactions

a group of arbys inc franchisees intends to 
pursue a 200 million buyout of miami financier victor posner 
despite the dismissal of leonard h roberts as the fastfood chains 
president and chief executive officer 
the offer still stands said dezanne phillips spokeswoman 
for the group of eight franchisees known as rb partners ltd 
this from rb partners point of view kind of fuels the fire 
she said 
roberts was fired a few hours after releasing a sharply worded 
letter tuesday announcing his resignation as vice chairman of the 
board and a director of posners dwg corp that company owns 60 
percent of chesapeake financial corp of which arbys is a wholly 
owned subsidiary 
the letter was highly critical of posner and of his decision not 
to discuss the proposed buyout with rb partners 
we are not in a position to comment in detail on mr roberts 
letter because of pending litigation but it is our opinion that 
statements in the letter are untrue in all material respects said 
dwg senior vice president renee mottram 
she said roberts was fired by arbys board by reason of his 
recent actions no successor was immediately named but ms 
mottram said one would be announced soon 
roberts in an interview tuesday before the dismissal was 
announced had said he intended to stay on as president and chief 
executive officer of atlantabased arbys which has about 2100 
outlets nationwide 
im trying to protect arbys he said i dont think arbys 
has any future under victor posner 
roberts said later he was not surprised by the firing 
i knew i had to take certain risks to stand up to a gentleman 
like posner he said i feel good about my separation from 
posner but i feel concerned about arbys arbys needs to be 
sold from victor posner 
roberts was named ceo of arbys in july 1985 after 11 years at 
ralston purina co before that he headed product development 
programs at armour amp co and the central soya co 
last week posner rejected the rb partners offer of 200 
million in cash for the arbys chain saying dwg has no interest 
in pursuing such a sale 
roberts said posners refusal even to talk with rb partners 
went against the wishes of some other dwg board members including 
himself roberts in his letter accused posner of trying to bully 
the board into seeing things his way 
rb partners whose members operate more than 500 of arbys 
outlets last week expressed concern over posners existing legal 
and financial problems 
posner pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion 
and was sentenced to five years probation with the condition that 
he repay his back taxes penalties and interest and create a 3 
million homeless fund 
howard hansen a restaurant industry analyst at kidder peabody in 
new york said tuesday that roberts had been a catalyst for 
arbys recent success which included an increase of 16 percent in 
sales and an 11 percent growth in number of new units in fiscal 1989 
theyve been successful with their marketing the hamburger 
alternative and the chicken club sandwich thats been very 
successful hansen said 
in 1988 arbys operating profit was 207 million on 1538 
million in revenue he said since 1985 the year roberts arrived 
900 new restaurants have been built and sales of increased 50 
percent 
in a letter dated monday to arbys franchisees four of arbys 
top executives including roberts described a meeting saturday in 
miami with posner in which a plan was announced to replace the 
existing management team 
dwgs ms mottram said the decision tuesday affected only roberts 
joe smaltz chairman of the 500member arbys franchise 
association said he was shocked and outraged at the decision to 
fire roberts crediting him with turning the company into a highly 
profitable one

an offer by a hong kong investor to help 
rescue the financially ailing hooker corp could help improve the 
credit image of some us department store chains owned by the 
australian property company 
hong kong investor lo yuk sui on wednesday offered to lend the 
australian concern 75 million through his property company 
richfield international investments ltd 
hookers us interests which total 1 billion include the 
bonwit teller and b altman chains a shopping mall in cincinnati as 
well as other properties 
in late july a group of creditor banks abandoned a plan to keep 
the company afloat and forced hooker which owes about 12 billion 
to australian and international banks to turn itself over to a 
courtappointed provisional liquidator 
earlier this month lj hooker the atlantabased us 
subsidiary of australias hooker corp filed for protection under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in new york 
at the time of the filing reports surfaced that vendors were 
reluctant to sell merchandise to bonwit teller and altmans due to 
the parent companys financial difficulties some vendors reportedly 
said they would sell merchandise to the stores only on a cash basis 
as part of the proposal richfield would acquire shares in hooker 
and gain options that eventully would give it at least 65 percent of 
the australian company 
in a letter proposing the takeover richfield said the 
restructing plan would provide for the orderly sale of some 
hooker assets 
richfield said it wanted to acquire hooker as a going concern 
in order to preserve asset values in australia and in the us 
otherwise many hooker assets will be sold prematurely and at 
unfavorable prices 
wardley james capel corporate finance ltd a unit of hongkong amp 
shanghai banking corp is advising lo on the proposed transaction 
hooker ran into financial problems earlier this year partly 
because of rising australian interest rates and the falling value of 
australian dollars 
lo is executive chairman of five publicly listed companies in

gulf coast shrimpers say a new federal 
regulation requiring them to use a device to protect endangered sea 
turtles may endanger their business 
what i fear is that the louisiana shrimper will become extinct 
before the kemps ridley sea turtle rep jimmy hayes dla said 
tuesday in response to the commerce department regulation 
by friday shrimpers must install a turtle excluder device 
or ted in their nets to allow turtles to swim free failure to do 
so could result in a maximum 20000 fine 
environmentalists say the action will save thousands of sea 
turtles captured in the nets from drowning but they contend it 
should have come months ago to protect such endangered species as 
kemps ridley leatherback and hawksbill and threatened species such 
as the loggerhead and green sea turtles 
shrimpers complain that while the requirement will save the 
turtles it also will significantly reduce their catch of shrimp 
perhaps as much as onethird and may force some to stop fishing 
its going to drive a lot of people out of business said 
jimmy russell president of a shrimpers association along the texas 
coast near brownsville and port isabel i wouldnt be surprised if 
they have a lot of people tell them theyre not going to do it 
in july when the government first tried to force shrimpers to 
install the teds ovallike metal grates that divert large sea 
animals such as turtles out of the net shrimpers in texas and 
louisiana blockaded waterways and threatened bodily harm to anyone 
who tried to force them to use the devices 
were not going to have any more blockades teejohn 
mialjevich president of the concerned shrimpers association said 
tuesday night he said the group will go to court in an attempt to 
reverse the regulation 
some shrimpers say teds will cut a boats daily catch by as much 
as onethird however a commerce spokesman said that sidebyside 
tests have shown losses to be only 2 percent to 5 percent and 
environmentalists argue that if the nets are operated properly 
losses should be no greater than 2 percent 
undersecretary of commerce john a knauss said the only way to 
ensure protection of the vanishing species of turtles is by using 
the trapdoor devices 
there is no other choice he said adding that attempts to 
protect the turtles by limiting the length of time that shrimpers 
nets are in the water didnt work 
the commerce decision came under a court directive requiring a 
solution to be found by sept 8 five environmental groups had filed 
lawsuits arguing that government action was required under the 
endangered species act 
the requirement for the teds was to have gone into effect in may 
but commerce secretary robert mosbacher suspended enforcement of the 
regulation after complaints from the shrimpers and their 
congressional representatives 
environmentalists said tuesday that they regretted the delay 
basically were pleased but were sorry it took so long and we 
had to jump through so many legal hoops said charles miller of 
the national wildlife federation at this point the turtles are 
going to have a fighting chance 
environmentalists warn that several of the sea turtle species 
especially the kemps ridley may be doomed to extinction if they 
are not protected from shrimpers nets 
the number of female kemps ridley sea turtles nesting each year 
has declined from some 42000 in the 1940s to no more than 700 
according to james ross an expert on sea turtles 
ross said that from 600 to 1600 kemps ridley turtles are killed 
each year often after young turtles get in the way of the shrimping 
nets the decline of the species is estimated at about 3 percent a 
year he said 
mialjevich of the louisianabased shrimpers association 
doesnt deny the number of those turtles has fallen dramatically 
but we did not bring the turtle population from 40000 to 600 
so how can we be the solution to saving them he asked

despite its ban on highlevel contacts with 
chinese authorities the bush administration plans working level 
discussions this month with chinese officials on that nations bid 
to join an international trade body a us official said today 
no firm date has been set for the meeting however and an 
official at the office of the us trade representative described 
the planned session as a regular bilateral consultation on chinese 
efforts to accede to the general agreement on tariffs and trade or 
gatt 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that despite 
the upcoming meeting the administration remains opposed to chinas 
entry to gatt 
they have to undertake significant economic reforms to be 
eligible for gatt membership fitzwater said 
he also defended the meeting and denied it was a violation of 
president bushs ban on highlevel uschinese contacts in the 
aftermath of the tianamen square massacre 
these are lowlevel continuing discussions they are not 
negotiations fitzwater said 
this can by no stretch of the imagination be considered a 
highlevel meeting said cecilia kline director for gatt affairs 
in the trade office the appointment hasnt been set up yet she 
said but when it is it would be a meeting in the normal course 
of diplomatic activity 
bush banned highlevel contacts june 3 after the chinese 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators among the canceled 
meetings were a visit to china by commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher 
a multilateral meeting scheduled for geneva in july on chinas 
effort to take part in the gatt was also postponed 
state department officials said today they want to continue 
working level discussions with the chinese on gatt 
that decision has come under fire from a conservative washington 
group the center for security policy which opposes closer ties 
with chinas communist government the centers director frank j 
gaffney released what kline called a purloined cable describing 
us efforts to schedule a bilateral gatt meeting 
she said the us government had told the chinese it was willing 
to meet with their gatt negotiators as hey headed to europe for 
discussions with other participants in the 96nation accord 
the presidents statement on highlevel contact i do not 
believe covered multilateral institutions she said we attend 
un meetings where the chinese are present 
us diplomats in beijing invited wang shichun of chinas 
ministry of foreign economic relations and trade to a meeting in 
washington on sept 1112 according to the cable 
wang expressed his surprise that washington had agreed to the 
talks he said their embassy in washington informed beijing that 
washington was unlikely to meet now said the cable signed by 
us ambassador james lilley 
wang said members of his delegation had not applied for visas and 
plane tickets and suggested a sept 18 meeting date instead the 
cable said 
gaffney a former deputy assistant defense secretary called the 
us invitation to wang a major new initiative that rewards the 
chinese with something that they have sought for a long time 
letting them into gatt fundamentally undercuts the forces 
that are pressing for reforms in the peoples republic of china and 
it signals the soviets and others who are facing social pressures 
that there is no punishment for a chinesestyle crackdown gaffney 
said 
he contends that secretary of state james a baker iii violated 
the ban july 31 by meeting with chinese foreign minister qian qichen 
at the beginning of the cambodian peace talks in paris 
state department sources said no date had been set for the 
meeting on gatt and described wang as deputy director of an 
office not a highranking individual and therefore not covered in 
the ban 
we would not be violating a ban that the president has 
instituted said one department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the presidents ban said the official applied to politicial 
level visits that would have a symbolic nature this would be a 
working level technical visit 
a second department official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the united states has a longterm interest in 
getting china to abide by the rules of market countries set forth 
in gatt and related international negotiations 
the objective is to try to encourage china to continue along 
its path of economic reform to have a economic system that would be 
consistent with market economies to abide by the same rules said 
the official

twentyone european airlines wednesday 
proposed a europewide air traffic control system to replace the 
national systems currently in place 
the airlines called on european governments to convene a 
ministerial conference to set a timetable for creating the single 
atc system 
the brusselsbased association of european airlines said that 
europes present fragmented approach based on 22 national atc 
systems with 42 control centers is costly and inefficient 
these centers operate with different levels of performance and 
technology with no commonly agreed standards and a lack of 
compatibility between the different systems said aea secretary 
general karl heinz neumeister 
according to aea the current system has led to a crisis in 
european air travel as delays of more than 15 minutes reached 30 
percent of european flights in june and july those delays cost 
airlines passengers and the european economy about 42 billion a 
year aea said 
moreover a europewide atc system could mean direct savings of 
500 million a year at present air traffic levels and 800 million 
a year when future growth is taken into account the group estimated 
air traffic control services in the 22 countries belonging to the 
european civil aviation conference cost 16 billion the same as 
the us air traffic control system according to the aea the us 
system however handles more than three times as many flights 
the aea study estimates that air traffic in europe could have 
been handled by six enroute facilities instead of the present 42 
the savings would far exceed the 22 billion national authorities 
are planning to spend on air traffic control over the next few 
years aea said 
it proposed a twotiered structure for a future european atc 
system at an operational level the group proposed the creation of 
a central holding company jointly owned by governments and private 
interests its main functions would be to finance air traffic 
control in europe direct investments and reduce the number of atc 
facilities over the longterm 
a central holding company for air traffic control would assure 
that investments were made for the system as a whole in contrast to 
the current poorly coordinated spending by spearate national 
authorities the aea said 
governments could coordinate their policies in safety security 
and political matters through the european organization for the 
safety of air navigation eurocontrol under the aea proposal 
eurocontrol is a brusselsbased intergovernmental body with 11 
members 
though efforts have been made to coordinate european air traffic 
control they have been insufficient so far aea said 
eurocontrol called the aea proposals an interesting 
contribution to the debate on the future of air traffic control in 
europe eurocontrol also defended its own record saying it has 
already taken over the task of developing a central flow 
management unit for western europe which will be based in 
brussels

eddie antar the reclusive founder and former 
chairman of the crazy eddie electronics chain was charged today in 
what authorities called a massive financial fraud to overstate 
the companys income 
the securities and exchange commission in a civil complaint 
lodged here accused antar and six former top executives with a 
broad scheme to inflate inventory and cover up losses federal 
prosecutors also are conducting an investigation 
during the time of the allegations antar sold his holdings in 
the company for 60 million the agency said the sec seeks 
injunctions return of any illegal profits from stock sales and 
penalties 
the edison njbased crazy eddie inc known for its manic 
commercials proclaiming our prices are insane has foundered in 
recent years after once boasting 43 stores in new york new jersey 
and pennsylvania 
a dissident group of shareholders bought out the company in late 
1987 but crazy eddie filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last june 
the sec said that antar in 1985 and 1986 ordered employees to 
falsify financial records to overstate the companys financial 
health for the two years pretax income was overstated by 87 
million the agency said 
in 1987 antar was still behind the scheme but it was directed by 
cousin sam e antar chief financial officer who was one of three 
men in the office of president created after antar withdrew from 
the firm according to the sec 
instead of a substantial loss that year the company reported 
pretax income of 206 million said the sec 
sec attorney richard simpson said the company used a variety of 
methods to inflate inventory from adding zeros on product lists to 
inflating prices on the books to fabricating product returns to 
manufacturers 
justin feldman a lawyer for eddie antar in a shareholder lawsuit 
against the former crazy eddie executive said he had not seen the 
secs papers and could not comment antar and other defendants have 
denied artificially inflating the companys worth in that case

a top government economist said wednesday it is 
unrealistic for the united states to expect current talks on 
structural trade barriers to produce quick changes in its 52 
billion trade imbalance with japan 
if the united states expects a specific change in the trade 
imbalance by april of next year then the talks will be totally 
counterproductive and our efforts will only backfire said masaru 
yoshitomi director general of the research division of the economic 
planning agency 
us trade officials have said they expect tangible changes 
from the talks which are expected to take place over a year the 
first round ended here tuesday and the next will be in washington on 
nov 67 
yoshitomi said the trade imbalance is due to general economic 
factors rather than japanese impediments to imports from the united 
states 
it should be rectified by broad economic and exchange rate 
policies not trade policy he said 
todays economic problems transcend the simple question of 
trade friction it is also necessary to establish a coleadership 
between japan and the united states yoshitomi said in a briefing 
to reporters 
if japan overcomes a current japan phobia among other nations 
based on its economic and technological prowess japan and the 
united states could establish a coleadership for the world for 
better world trade policies overseas development aid programs and 
an improved international monetary system he said 
in volume terms japans exports have changed little since 1985 
while its imports of manufactured goods have grown 106 percent 
government statistics show 
however in value terms the gains failed to register because the 
yen is stronger now in dollar terms yoshitomi said 
during the two days of talks dubbed the structural impediments 
initiative the two countries agreed to develop their own plans to 
overcome structural barriers to trade 
the talks centered on japans intricate distribution system 
exclusive corporate relationships and land use policy as well as 
the savings and investment balance government regulations and 
corporate behavior in the united states 
among other things japan was asked to relax government 
regulations on distribution modify its land and construction 
policies and improve foreign access to domestic distribution 
channels 
the united states was urged to cut consumption slash its budget 
deficit enhance its productive capacity and review government 
regulations detrimental to industrial competitiveness 
the governing liberal democratic party which faces unprecedented 
low public approval ratings at home may find it difficult to 
institute such fundamental economic changes 
the party appears far more reluctant now than ever before about 
going ahead with market liberalization at the risk of losing further 
votes the japan times newspaper said in an analysis wednesday 
an election for the powerful lower house of parliament is 
expected within the next several months opposition parties which 
made impressive gains in july elections for the upper house of 
parliament oppose drastic marketopening measures 
a top foreign ministry official said some of the changes the 
united states is demanding such as those relating to corporate 
behavior are beyond government control

ford motor co a relatively small player in the 
world of big trucks is negotiating with saabscania ab of stockholm 
with an eye on the swedish companys truck business experts say 
because it has been making and selling cars in europe for more 
than 60 years ford wouldnt need saabs car distribution network 
ford in fact sells more cars in sweden than does saab 
and while ford doesnt offer a car like the topofthe line saab 
9000 it has the technology and engineering skill to make one the 
analysts added in interviews tuesday 
what ford doesnt have is a medium and heavyduty truck 
operation in europe like the scania division of the swedish company 
ford and saab earlier this week confirmed reports that the two 
companies had been holding negotiations about a business 
arrangement no one would elaborate or comment further 
the jewel at saab is the truck division auto analyst ron 
glantz of montgomery securities inc of san francisco said earlier 
this week im not sure why ford would bother with the car 
division 
saabscanias annual report from last year showed that its truck 
divisions pretax earnings were more than 300 times that of its car 
division for the last five years the companys trucks have shown 
profit increases while the saabs cars have been earnings losers 
from 198688 
much of the decline in car earnings came when the us dollar 
weakened making imported items more expensive 
the car is somewhat eccentric i have one myself glantz 
said i can see why saab would want to sell the car division i 
cant see why ford would want to buy 
i think its absolutely trucks said analyst joseph phillippi 
of shearson lehman hutton of new york city scania is hardly even 
visible in the united states 
saabscania of america inc supplies vehicles to saab dealers in 
the united states it operated a bus manufacturing plant in orange 
conn from 1984 to late 1988 
saab is basically a heavy truck maker that also makes airplanes 
and cars glantz said 
ford motor co ab was founded in stockholm sweden in 1924 to 
market ford products in the scandinavia the company was involved in 
manufacturing in sweden for about 10 years mostly in the 1950s

the societe des bourses francaises said wednesday it 
has approved a sweetened 41 billion bid by compagnie financiere de 
suez for compagnie industrielle and its insurance unit compagnie 
financiere du groupe victoire in what would be frances biggest 
takeover ever 
the sbf the paris stock exchanges selfregulatory body also 
said in a statement it has extended the close of the tender offer to 
sept 25 from the original date of sept 18 
the approval and the extension of the 272 billionfranc offer 
bring suez which won a huge struggle last year for control of 
societe generale de belgique one step closer to final victory 
the only regulatory hurdle remaining for the bid is the 
governments commission des operations de bourse which already 
approved the initial suez bid the new approval is expected before 
the end of the week 
french stock analysts said the apparent success of the suez offer 
was an indication of trends in the insurance industry as greater 
integration of european businesses approaches and in the french 
stock market where largescale takeovers such as those common in 
the united states and britain have been rare 
we have proof now that what happens in other countries could 
happen in paris said georges dieng of the paris broker 
choletdupont its the business mentality that is evolving 
the previous record takeover bid in france was a bid last year by 
schneider sa of about 930 million or 6 billion francs for control 
of telemecanique electrique sa 
alain tchibozo an analyst for tuffier ravier py et associes in 
paris said more takeovers can be expected especially in the 
insurance industry among the regulations falling in 1992 when the 
european economic community countries will end trade and business 
barriers will be those that previously made it difficult for 
insurance companies to sell policies outside their own countries 
theres going to be a grand battle in insurance tchibozo 
said its important to have a network and you cant start an 
insurance company now its too expensive you have to buy one 
suez which traces its corporate roots to the building of the 
suez canal in the 19th century has developed a diversified array of 
assets in banking industry insurance and real estate 
the takeover was not expected to cause any changes of course for 
groupe victoire which vaulted to the rank of secondlargest french 
insurance company with its recent purchase of the west german 
insurer colonia versicherung ag 
suez has always allowed its subsidiaries a great deal of 
autonomy dieng said i dont think it will change much for 
victoire suez could eventually give them the chance for further 
alliances 
the sweetened suez bid made tuesday offers 14800 francs for each 
share plus 2276 francs a share for victoires common stock and 
1138 francs a share for its nonvoting stock 
the earlier bid which was criticized by the target companys 
management as inadequate offered 13000 francs a share for 
compagnie industrielle 2000 francs a share for victoire common 
stock and 1000 francs a share for its nonvoting stock 
compagnie industrielle president jeanmarc vernes said he would 
tender his 255percent share in the company under the revised suez 
offer virtually guaranteeing the financial holding companys bid 
will succeed

enterprise oil plc said wednesday it has reached an 
agreement with british gas plc and amerada hess corp of the united 
states under which each of the three companies is permitted to buy 
parts of texas eastern north sea inc the north sea oil assets of 
texas eastern corp 
enterprise oil had planned to buy the texas eastern assets on its 
own for 961 million but british gas and amerada hess won a british 
court case which ruled that the deal would contravene a 1965 
exploration agreement which granted british gas and amerada hess 
preemptive rights on the texas eastern assets 
the court ruled that all three companies should be allowed to buy 
a share of the texas eastern north sea assets 
under the new agreement enterprise said it will pay 289 million 
plus accumulated interest for all or part of texas eastern north 
seas interests in three producing north sea fields two fields 
under development and a number of exploration prospects 
these interests contain estimated oil reserves of 93 million 
barrels or 32 percent of texas easterns total estimated reserves 
of 285 million barrels these interests will be acquired immediately 
the remainder of texas easterns interests will be divided 
between british gas and amerada hess 
following the announcement british gas shares rose 15 pence or 
23 cents to 207 pounds or about 318 while enterprise oil 
shares climbed 5 pence to 608 pounds 
earlier this year enterprise oil paid 422 million for a number 
of texas easterns exploration and production interests in norway 
indonesia denmark the netherlands and alaska 
enterprise said the addition of the texas eastern interests would 
lift its total production to around 115000 barrels a day compared 
with an average 60000 barrels a day in 1988 
while it is disappointing not to have been able to complete the 
totality of the texas eastern acquisition the deal represents a 
sensible resolution of the outstanding issues said enterprise oil 
chairman william bell 
we are now well placed to become the uks leading independent 
enterprise and production company 
british gas and amerada together will pay 673 million plus 
interest for the remainder of the texas eastern interests not owned 
by enterprise of those assets british gas will hold 63 percent 
while amerada will take the remaining 37 percent interest 
the companies said they plan to run texas eastern north sea as a 
company using the existing organization and staff resources

crazy eddie inc founder eddie antar and 
former top management of the electronics chain that advertised 
insane prices were charged wednesday with insider trading and 
systematically altering financial books to inflate earnings 
antar directed a massive financial fraud that artifically 
boosted pretax income by 29 million from 1985 to 1987 the 
securities and exchange commission said in a complaint filed in 
federal court here the alleged scheme included exaggerating 
inventory and falsely reducing bills to suppliers the agency said 
antar a highschool dropout who built the chain to 43 outlets 
from a single store in brooklyn ny sold 56 million shares of 
company stock for 60 million while knowing that the stock price was 
based on exaggerated information the sec said 
the agency seeks the return of illgotten trading profits 
penalties and injunctions against further violations 
six other exofficials were named including antars brother 
mitchell antar and cousins sam e antar and eddie gindi mitchell 
and sam e antar and defendant david panoff were also charged with 
insider trading for selling stock and falsifying financial records 
sec attorney richard simpson said the proceeds from their stock 
sales totaled less than 1 million 
gindi and former employees isaac kairey and kathleen morin 
settled the falsifying records charge without denying or admitting 
it they were not accused of insider trading and the company was 
not charged 
justin feldman a lawyer for eddie antar in a shareholder lawsuit 
against the former executive said he had not seen the secs papers 
and could not comment in the shareholder case antar denied 
artificially inflating the companys figures 
antar 41 dropped from sight in 1987 refusing to speak to 
reporters or analysts 
were trying to track him down said sec attorney richard 
simpson antars last known address was on manhattans east side 
the complaint said 
mitchell antars attorney marvin gersten called the charges 
totally false 
we intend to vigorously defend this said gersten who noted 
his client left the company in may 1987 and supported dissident 
shareholders in a fight to oust eddie antar attorneys for sam e 
antar and panoff declined comment 
the us attorneys office here is conducting a parallel criminal 
probe 
the first major indication of edisonbased crazy eddies present 
troubles came shortly after the dissident stockholders assumed 
control in late 1987 new management announced it had discovered 
phantom inventory of 65 million 
the company allegedly used a variety of methods from adding 
zeros on numbers in product lists to inflating prices on the books 
to fabricating product returns to manufacturers 
rather than a substantial loss in 1987 crazy eddie reported 
pretax income of 206 million in 1985 its reported income of 
126 million was inflated by 2 million and in 1986 reported 
income of 265 million was overstated by 67 million the 
complaint said 
the sec complaint is the latest blow to the company known for its 
raucous commercials featuring actor jerry carroll waving his arms 
and shouting about insanely low prices 
the ad campaign and a boom in consumer demand for videocassette 
recorders answering machines and other electronics helped make 
crazy eddie one of the leading electronics retail chains in the 
northeast at its peak crazy eddie had 43 stores in new york new 
jersey connecticut and pennsylvania 1500 employees and sales of 
260 million 
in june the company filed for protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code

the countrys economics minister plans 
to approve a proposed takeover by automaker daimlerbenz of west 
germanys largest aerospace and defense contractor government 
sources said wednesday 
economics minister helmut haussmann is expected to announce his 
decision to approve the takeover of messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh 
at a news conference friday said the sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the decision would culminate two years of haggling over one of 
the biggest corporate mergers in west german history 
under terms of the merger approval daimler already west 
germanys largest industrial concern will shed mbbs interests in 
battle tank manufacturer krauss maffei some of its board members 
will relinquish supervisory board posts at other companies 
the government also is expected to give up its interest in the 
european airbus industrie project now held through mbb sooner than 
planned 
in addition deutsche bank ag west germanys largest bank will 
slightly lower its 28 percent shareholding in daimlerbenz in an 
effort to ease fears over the banks dominant role in industry the 
sources said 
the west german cartel office earlier this year voted down the 
merger saying it would give daimler a dominant position in defense 
aerospace and truck manufacturing sectors 
the federal monopolies commission later voted to go along with 
the proposal but only if daimler shed some of its defense holdings 
the economics minister also hinted to parliament on wednesday 
that he would approve the deal he told the chamber that he would 
hold to the basic orientation of the monopolies commision in 
making the decision 
haussmann has the power to override the cartel office decision if 
he determines that the merger is in the nations economic interest 
the west german government has backed the deal as a way of easing 
its share of the subsidy burden in the lossplagued airbus program 
even by shedding some operations the conglomerate still will be 
a major global force in weapons sales and aviation technology

miller brewing co spent 16 months promoting a 
labor day blast featuring the whos last us concert a party that 
boosted beer sales but did little to erase the industrys just say 
yes stigma among critics 
now that the partys over the no 2 us beer maker behind 
anheuserbusch cos says its multimillion dollar biggest party in 
history effort in texas won more miller customers in one of the 
most lucrative beer markets 
at the same time antialcohol groups accused the brewer of 
irresponsibly beckoning underage guzzlers with feelgood ads a 
charge miller denies 
its texas campaign reflected an image problem faced by many 
brewers scrapping over a stagnant beerdrinking population caused 
partly by greater social awareness of alcohols potential dangers 
even young people say some beer ads aimed at them are offensive and 
patronizing 
miller especially drew heavy criticism this spring for a 
supplement mailed to college newspapers featuring bikiniclad coeds 
clutching beer bottles and offering tips for men on sure fire ways 
to scam babes 
the milwaukeebased brewer a subsidiary of consumer products 
giant philip morris cos remains sensitive about the supplement 
which it admitted was in poor taste when some students objected the 
supplement was hastily withdrawn and miller officials still bristle 
when the subject is raised 
the biggest party in history campaign conspicuously stayed 
away from gorgeous babes and hunks extolling the brew choosing 
instead texasborn actor randy quaid as pitchman 
in addition as part of the campaign miller donated 1 million in 
proceeds to the texas special olympics an athletic competition for 
the handicapped one commercial featured quaid and several special 
olympians 
it still didnt sit well with activists against substance abuse 
ive got a real question as to how brewers gear their 
advertising toward young people said milo kirk a national vice 
president of mothers against drunk driving and a founder of the 
dallas chapter they gear their advertising around concerts and 
sporting events one brewer is using a dog and studies will 
show children react to animals 
what is the subliminal message that theyre trying to get 
across here she said 
anheuserbusch which uses the bull terrier spuds mckenzie in 
some of its beer ads evidently was so stung by this kind of 
criticism that it agreed to donate 250000 to the texas chapter of 
students against drunk driving 
miller official tom cardella who spearheaded the biggest 
party campaign said it was directed primarily at drinkers of 
miller lite in texas where the brand had been losing ground 
it is not targeted at below minimum drinking age he said 
the campaign is directed at legal age people miller also issued 
colored wristbands during the party in an effort to block purchases 
by minors 
jerry steinman who publishes an industry newsletter about the 
beer business defended brewer advertising as proper and ethical he 
said automobile makers are worse offenders 
beer companies dont go running around showing teenagers in 
ads he said 
is it more responsible for an automobile manufacturer to 
emphasize speed and the zoom style of youth than it is for the beer 
manufacturers to sponsor a concert that entertains steinman said 
the money at stake is enormous steinman estimates the total 
market at 45 billion a year with texas accounting for about 82 
percent second only to california 
that means each percentage share in texas is worth about 37 
million in retail sales steinmans beer marketers insights inc 
shows miller as a brand has finished a close second to 
anheuserbusch cos inc since 1983 
miller officials say the advertising campaign has changed that 
based on the texas state shipment reports compiled by the 
wholesale beer distributors of texas inc year to date through 
july miller lite brand was up 9 percent cardella said in 
comparison in 1987 miller lite was down 6 to 7 percent 
prior to the campaign miller lite was in the number two 
position and as of this july shipment report miller is the number 
one brand in texas by 2 percentage points he said 
beginning in june 1988 miller began the advertising campaign 
built around the concept of the biggest party in history with 
free concerts in six texas cities 
the highlight was the sunday night concert by the who in dallas 
the last stop on what may be their last tour the who concert in 
dallas cotton bowl which also featured stevie ray vaughn and the 
fabulous thunderbirds was not free although groups except the who 
performed for free earlier in the day 
an estimated 500000 people attended the events 120000 in 
houston saturday and about 90000 in dallas sunday 
the campaign included radio television and print ads featuring 
quaid searching texas for a place large enough for the party 
finding enough food or the right date each spot was signed off 
with the slogan ill get back to you later with more details 
although quaid is hardly a matinee idol cardella said he was 
selected because he is a native texan and based on his 
appearance he comes across in a very fun enjoyable manner kind of 
homespun very folksy 
miller was pleased with quaids acceptance said company 
spokeswoman beverly jurkowski who declined to say if the brewery 
was considering further campaigns with quaid 
jack raskopf a professor at texas christian university in fort 
worth who has studied advertising of controversial materials gave 
miller high marks for the campaign 
i think it helped itself said raskopf they did take a 
gamble they could have had a drunk go berserk but it was a 
remarkably docile crowd 
he said brewers are faced with advertising a product that is 
probably of questionable value to society but on the other hand it 
is a perfectly legitimate product 
brewers have been criticized for their advertising since cain 
opened the first brewery raskopf said miller lost no ground 
there 
cardella said miller had planned from the outset to promote 
responsible drinking and near the end of the campaign aired a 
commercial featuring the whos roger daltrey and pete townsend 
urging partygoers to think when you drink with townsend signing 
off saying remember who cares 
ms kirk however said madd and others had hoped miller would 
make a more direct appeal why didnt they come right out and have 
randy quaid come out and say if youre under 21 we dont want you

buick on wednesday introduced its longdelayed 
reatta convertible after solving engineering problems on the first 
softtop buick since 1985 
buick general manager ed mertz said the general motors corp 
division may make as many reatta convertibles as hardtop versions of 
the sporty twoseater introduced last year 
mertz declined to estimate sales for the 1990 versions of the 
reatta which was introduced as a hardtop early last year or any 
other buick line but he predicted the full buick divisions share 
of the us car market would rise to about 6 percent from an 
expected 57 percent at the end of this year 
more and more people are understanding the cars we build 
mertz said at the formal introduction of the companys 1990 cars in 
this detroit suburb 
buick has sold 5509 reatta coupes priced at 26700 through 
aug 31 
tracking reatta sales is difficult since production at the reatta 
craft centre in lansing was stopped or slowed several times for 
retooling for convertible production and installation of a new paint 
shop 
mertz said once reatta convertible production gets into full 
swing late this year or early next year the company should make as 
many soft tops as hardtops 
the convertible is expected to be in dealer showrooms next spring 
but prices wont be announced until later this year 
production of the coupe began in january 1988 at the craft 
centre a convertible was to be introduced later that year but 
engineering problems with the top delayed introduction until this 
fall 
the convertible reatta is the first softtop buick has offered 
since the 1985 riviera which was converted by an outside company 
the last buickproduced convertible was the 1975 lesabre 
also for 1990 buick will offer the regal as a fourdoor sedan 
part of the gm10 line of midsize cars the cars originally were 
introduced as twodoor coupes a move criticized by analysts who 
thought the company was missing an important segment of the midsize 
car market

new york state officials have decided that 
not all that glitters should be subject to sales tax 
as of sept 1 new york repealed its sales tax that had been 
imposed on all investment transactions involving gold silver 
platinum and other precious metals the move by gov mario cuomo and 
the state legislature came this year at the urging of the banking 
and investment industry 
under the new law new yorks sales tax wont be charged for 
transactions involving 1000 or more in precious metals for 
investment purposes only 
sales tax is still charged on precious coins purchased for 
collecting and for investment purchases under 1000 its also 
still charged on metals and coins from south africa such as the 
krugerrand the state legislature specifically excluded them because 
of that countrys racist policies state officials said 
in new york city where sales tax is 8 percent repealing the 
levy is expected to boost the local metals trade previously 
investors had been going to states where no sales tax was charged 
such as delaware and illinois said state tax and finance department 
spokesman paul rickard about a dozen other states charge no sales 
tax 
for investors that means theyd be able to buy metals in new 
york without the markup that sales tax brings 
removing that barrier will have an enormous impact said nina 
lipton research manager for platinum guild international a new 
york citybased platinum dealers trade association you can buy 
more there will be more reasons to buy in new york 
for new york dealers that means more money precious metals 
dealers in washington reported a 41 percent increase in gross sales 
the year after that state repealed its sales tax on gold silver and 
platinum according to a washington dcbased dealers trade 
association 
wed expect new york dealers to experience a tremendous 
increase in their sales said howard segermark president of the 
industry council for tangible assets new yorkers are much more 
likely to deal with new york firms 
and for new york state the change is expected to bring in an 
additional 955000 in tax revenues the first year and about 
515000 a year after that half that money would go to local 
governments namely new york city 
generally repealing a tax means the state would lose money but 
rickard said the state stands to make money on the move because it 
expects to collect more tax revenue from storage of the precious 
metals in bank vaults and other facilities 
new york wasnt seeing much in sales tax revenues from precious 
metals investments anyway because investors were buying the metals 
in other states rickard said 
new yorks action puts precious metals on a par with stocks and 
bonds which had already been exempt from sales tax 
now investors have a choice said luis vigdor executive vice 
president of mtb banking corp they can walk into a store and take 
their maple leafs and platinum koala coins home with them or they 
can store them in a vault all without penalty

the stock market on wednesday suffered the first 
sizable drop since reaching alltime highs last month but the dow 
jones industrial average remained within striking distance of record 
levels 
in other markets the dollar retreated after its recent surge and 
bond prices improved 
the healthy bond market helped arrest the slide in stocks which 
saw the dow jones average fall nearly 40 points around midday at 
the close the average was down 2489 points at 271979 
analysts said there was no major economic news to account for the 
stock markets retreat which followed a rally that pushed up the 
widely watched industrial average 150 points from late july to late 
august 
you had some sell programs in a market that was ripe for some 
rampr anyway said walter murphy a senior market analyst at merrill 
lynch amp co he was referring to computerized trading strategies that 
buy and sell stocks based on predetermined formulas 
it was an inauspicious beginning for the postvacation autumn 
trading season after the sluggish activity surrounding the labor day 
holiday 
most traders were looking toward a pickup of the market with 
the big players probably all back so it was rather disappointing 
said charles jensen an analyst at mki securities corp 
in the bond market the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 
more than 3 for every 1000 in face value its yield which falls 
when the price rises dropped to 81 percent the improvement came 
in spite of persistent concerns that the federal reserve will not 
move to lower interest rates anytime soon 
the dollars decline was attributed partly to speculation that 
west germany and japan might hike their interest rates and to 
reports that japans central bank was continuing to sell dollars to 
knock the currency down 
but earl i johnson a trader for harris trust amp co in chicago 
said overall demand for the dollar remained strong were just 
seeing a technical retrenchment he said 
the stock market is behaving differently from two years ago in 
1987 the dow jones industrial average hit an alltime high on aug 
25 and then snowballed downward culminating in the record 508point 
decline on oct 19 1987 
this year the average hit an alltime high on aug 24 but 
instead of peaking it set two more records in the following weeks 
wednesdays close was still the averages 10th highest ever and left 
it within easy striking range of record territory 
trading was nervous and selling of stock index futures on the 
chicago markets translated into stock sales in new york 
this is a comment about how temperamental the market is said 
chung lew head stock trader at kleinwort benson inc 
some analysts groping for an explanation for the stock markets 
decline cited a recommendation to sell some stocks that was made by 
morgan stanley amp co strategist barton biggs and quoted wednesday in 
the new york times 
others cited a selloff in japan where the nikkei stock average 
fell about a half percent over worries about the possibility of a 
rise in japanese interest rates 
all things considered it fell more than i thought it should 
have said bill schneider a vice president at kidder peabody amp 
co

a judge on wednesday refused to release 
identities of unisys corp employees possibly involved with a 
defense consultant who sold procurement secrets to the company 
us district judge diana murphy said privacy interests of the 
unisys workers supersede the publics first amendment right to 
review court documents 
murphy has released a series of documents related to the june 14 
1988 search of unisys property in eagan a suburb of minneapolis as 
part of a nationwide investigation into defense procurement fraud 
but names of the unisys employees in the set released wednesday were 
blackened out 
that leaves undisclosed 39 words in all documents related to the 
search the undisclosed words all refer to identities of people 
connected with the investigation 
the judge decided to protect the identity of the unisys employees 
in the latest batch of documents even though federal prosecutors had 
no objection to releasing their names the star tribune and st paul 
pioneer press dispatch sued to gain the unconditional release of all 
documents related to the search 
a lawyer for the unisys employees has maintained that disclosure 
of the names would tarnish the reputations of his clients even 
though they have not been charged with a crime 
tim mcguire managing editor of the star tribune said the 
newspaper wont seek further disclosure of information in the 
documents 
we do not plan to pursue the case any further mcguire said 
we have gotten more information than any other circuit we think 
that thats been valuable and important 
mcguire said federal judges in districts around the country have 
been inconsistent in ruling on media requests for the release of 
documents in the case 
the disparity signals a need for the newspaper industry and the 
justice department to discuss disclosure issues to prevent this 
kind of fiasco in the future mcguire said 
mark nadler managing editor of the pioneer press dispatch said 
the newspaper is reviewing murphys decision but doesnt have any 
immediate plans to appeal 
the release of the latest set of documents followed william j 
sandas guilty plea friday to procuring information in 1987 for 
unisys and other defense contractors in exchange for large 
consulting fees 
court documents show sanda received confidential information on 
the navys 100 million advanced tactical air command central system 
and passed it on to unisys and other companies 
sanda a former unisys employee in eagan admitted passing on 
confidential documents to a unisys marketing representative who 
agreed to write a series of purchase orders for sanda for 25000

grinding progress oneill said

prime computer incs former chairman has 
denied he violated insider trading rules by buying nearly 1 million 
of prime stock shortly before a takeover offer for the company was 
made public last fall 
david j dunn who resigned last month acknowledged in a 
newspaper interview published wednesday that the transaction looked 
questionable but insisted it was proper 
dunn said he and his texasbased investment firm idanta 
partners bought 64700 shares for 986675 or an average of 1525 
apiece on nov 7 and 8 a few weeks after prime rejected a 
confidential merger proposal from investor bennett s lebows mai 
basic four inc of tustin calif 
a week later when lebow publicly offered to buy prime for 970 
million the market value of dunns and idantas shares jumped to 
about 18 each yielding a paper profit of more than 177000 
dunn told the middlesex news of framingham that he had not taken 
lebows private proposal seriously and was surprised by the 
subsequent public offer 
obviously you dont trade stock based on material information 
that is not public but we didnt believe it was material we 
thought it was an effort to get prime to buy mai he said 
as soon as lebow did make the tender offer i went to the 
attorneys and i offered to sell the stock to the company at the 
price we paid for it but they said that would indicate that we 
thought we had done something wrong 
i agree with you that this is unusual but the facts are above 
board nothing has been hidden 
prime computer based in natick makes minicomputers and is the 
second largest maker of computeraided design and manufacturing 
equipment surpassed only by international business machines corp

billion last year 
after lebow pursued prime for more than eight months the company 
reached a merger agreement this summer with jh whitney amp co a 
new york venture capital firm for 20 a share or more than 1 
billion 
the securities and exchange commission declined to comment on 
whether it has investigated dunns stock trading massachusetts 
regulators said the state was not probing the transaction 
some securities analysts said the trading had raised eyebrows on 
wall street 
if your question is do people know about it yes if your 
question is does it smell yes said john logan industry analyst 
for the aberdeen group in boston but is it insider trading well 
the securities and exchange commission and the courts would have to 
decide that 
dunn did not return messages left wednesday at his office in san 
diego it was not clear whether he and idanta have sold any of the 
stock

three manufacturers of a widely used class of 
fungicides announced wednesday they are halting sales for use on 
dozens of fruits and vegetables because of government concerns that 
the potential cancer risks are too high 
the fungicides involved the ethylene bisdithiocarbamate or ebdc 
class have been under a special review by the environmental 
protection agency since 1987 because a breakdown product has been 
shown to cause cancer in test animals 
in a joint announcement the three manufacturers the du pont 
co pennwalt corp and rohm amp haas co said they ending sales for 
many fruits and vegetables to maintain public confidence in the 
foods 
the decision came as the epa was preparing to order curbs on ebdc 
uses because of recent tests that indicated unacceptable cancer 
risks from residues in some foods 
the manufacturers maintained that despite their action the 
chemical is safe for consumers if used properly 
but according to epa documents agency tests show that the 
cancer risks posed by ebdc residues on some foods can be more than 
23 times the oneinone million level the agency uses to indicate 
neglible risk in the case of residues on tomatoes it can be 63 
times the benchmark level 
that contrasts to epas estimate of a lifetime cancer risk of 45 
times the benchmark for alar the widely publicized chemical that 
caused an uproar earlier this year becuase of its use on apples 
the epa estimates that the chances of a person getting cancer 
during a lifetime from exposure to ebdc residues on all foods could 
be as high as one in 10000 a level that has triggered restrictions 
on many chemicals in the past 
that result assumes crop residues are at the maximum permitted 
level the companies are conducting marketbasket studies to 
determine actual exposure to consumers since the chemical is known 
to decay with time 
epa spokesman john kasper said he could not immediately provide 
specific test results but added weve got some risk estimates 
that were concerned about 
kasper said the manufacturers voluntary withdrawl would be 
examined by the agency its entirely possible we could make the 
restrictions on ebdcs use even more stringent to reduce the risks 
even further he said 
one form of the chemical mancozeb is sold by all three 
companies and another form maneb is sold by pennwalt 
the action is being taken to maintain public confidence in the 
safety of fruits and vegetables said the three manufacturers in a 
joint statement they said the chemical could continue to be used on 
13 crops 
although the announcement named no products an environmental 
group the natural resources defense council said the 13 products 
for which ebdc will continue to be used include potatoes sugar 
beets sweet corn tomatoes and wheat and almonds 
the fungicide has been used on more than 70 crops the major 
crops for which use will be discontinued include apples carrots 
celery cucumbers melons pears squash and pineapples according 
to the environmental group 
the fungicide has been used for nearly 40 years and according to 
some estimates from 12 to 18 million tons are used annually
