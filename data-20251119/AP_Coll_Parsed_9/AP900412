a jury thursday recommended execution 
for a convict who murdered his exwife while on prison furlough 
last year 
alan l matheney 39 stood quietly as lake county superior 
court judge james e letsinger read the recommendation of death in 
the electric chair letsinger who must make the final decision 
set sentencing for may 4 
the same jury wednesday rejected matheneys insanity defense and 
convicted him of murder and burglary in the march 4 1989 beating 
death of lisa marie bianco 
the jury deliberated for more than four hours thursday before 
issuing a recommendation had jurors not elected to recommend 
death they could have urged a prison sentence of up to 60 years 
for murder and 20 years for burglary 
matheneys mother martha matheney showed no reaction to the 
decision as she sat in the back row of the courtroom 
the victims father eugene bianco said he was pleased its 
a just sentence for the crime he committed bianco said i hope 
it doesnt drag on for years 
a death sentence would automatically be appealed to the state 
supreme court 
bianco said his grandchildren still have nightmares about the 
night matheney broke into their home armed with an unloaded 
shotgun and threatened their mother matheney chased ms bianco 
into the street and beat her outside a neighbors home 
the kids miss their mother more and they wish mr matheney 
was no longer their father bianco said 
letsinger extended a gag order on attorneys until sentencing 
st joseph county prosecutor michael p barnes cited the order and 
declined to comment 
defense attorney scott l king however held a brief news 
conference outside the courthouse and said he would argue for a 
prison term 
the state proved two circumstances burglary and lying in wait 
to justify the death penalty county deputy prosecutor john d 
krisor said earlier 
the slaying sparked a furor over officials failure to notify 
ms bianco 29 of the furlough for matheney who had been serving 
an eightyear sentence for assaulting her in 1987 the states 
furlough program was suspended and later reinstated with tightened 
restrictions

a federal judge awarded more than 27 
million in damages wednesday to the family of a father and son who 
perished when a small plane collided with an aeromexico jet over 
southern california in 1986 
it was the second case to result in a damage award to relatives 
of people killed in the disaster which claimed 82 lives 
us district judge manuel l real ruled the family was entitled 
to 2733666 in compensation for economic and personal losses due 
to the deaths of joe guzman 45 and his son robert 18 
joe guzmans daughter reann 5 was awarded 427254 of the 
damages 
the norwalk truck driver and his son were on the aeromexico jet 
returning to los angeles from a fishing vacation in baja california 
when the jet collided with a small private plane and crashed into 
suburban cerritos 
the death toll totaled 67 people in the aircraft and 15 people 
in the neighborhood 20 miles southeast of los angeles 
in the first case a different judge awarded about 13 million 
to a san jose man who lost his wife and son in the crash dozens of 
similar cases to determine damages are pending 
the lawsuits are based upon the decision of a federal jury that 
last april blamed the crash equally on the government through the 
actions of an airtraffic controller and on william kramer the 
pilot of the small plane

the soviet union for the first time has admitted 
responsibility for the massacre of thousands of polish prisoners in 
the katyn forest during world war ii the british broadcasting 
corp reported friday 
until now the soviet union has blamed the 1940 massacre of 
15000 polish army officers and soldiers near the western town 
smolensk on nazi germany 
the formal admission of guilt coincides with the threeday state 
visit of polish president wojciech jaruzelski who is scheduled to 
visit katyn saturday the acknowledgement of responsibility for the 
slaying has been one of the conditions for improvement in relations 
between poland and the soviet union 
a bbc world service radio news bulletin quoted radio moscow as 
saying recently discovered documents determined the crime was 
carried out by the soviet nkvd predecessors of the kgb secret 
police 
the bbc quoted the official radio as describing the massacre as 
one of the worst outrages of the stalinist era in the soviet union 
and said radio moscow expressed deep regret for the atrocity 
the katyn area where the bodies of more than 4000 polish 
offiders were found in a mass grave changed hands as the war 
progressed first being under soviet control and then nazi control 
the victims were prisoners of war captured in the nazisoviet 
partition of poland at the start of the war the poles had been 
interned after the soviets invaded poland in 1939 
the killings eliminated some of most talented officers in 
poland and for years has been a source of deep resentment for 
poles who until august were under communist rule the government is 
now under rule of the solidarity tradue union movement 
the crime was first disclosed in 1943 by the nazis who 
attributed it to the nkvd

culture minister jack lang has denounced a new us 
immigration rule saying it will soon be easier for foreign artists 
and performers to work in moscow than new york 
lang was referring to a regulation which took effect feb 26 
requiring foreign artists who wish to work temporarily in the 
united states to show proof of their commercial success or 
international fame to obtain the desirable h1 visa 
under the new rule vincent van gogh would be denied access to 
american territory lang told reporters at a news conference 
the ruling means that as far as cultural exchange is 
concerned moscow is more accessible than los angeles or new 
york he said 
a second category of visas called h2s are issued on a regular 
basis to ordinary alien workers but lang said the procedure for 
obtaining them is much slower and more complicated making it 
difficult for performers to arrange their schedules 
the us embassy in paris issued a statement saying no laws 
concerning h1 or h2 have been changed 
the new regulations issued on feb 26 were simply a 
clarification of existing laws there has been a long tradition of 
cultural exchange between france and the united states and we trust 
that a continuing spirit of cooperation and mutual respect will 
resolve any problems that may arise the statement said 
in a recent commentary in billboard magazine american 
immigration lawyer jeffrey gabel said there were fears in the 
united states that the new rule would hinder foreign artists who 
are not superstars 
the effects of this action could narrow the chances of foreign 
artists and entertainers and their support staffs to enter the 
united states gabel wrote 
lang cited several examples of artists famous in france but 
not superstars in the minds of us immigration officers who have 
been denied h1 visas 
they include film maker elie chouraqui and the rock group 
niagara which was forced to cancel performances in baltimore 
chicago and washington this year after failing to get visas 
lang said niagaras musicians were asked by immigration 
officials to show proof of their usefulness to the american 
public 
chouraqui lang said received a visa only after weeks of 
waiting and the intervention of lang paris mayor jacques chirac 
and finally jack valenti president of the motion picture 
association of america 
lang called the new rule unacceptable and urged the united 
states to modify it as quickly as possible to ensure the free 
circulation of artists worldwide 
in france all artists are welcome he said during tuesdays 
news conference adding that french work permits for foreign 
artists are simple rapid certain free and almost automatic 
lang said he would discuss the issue with his colleagues at the 
may 13 meeting of european cabinet ministers he urged the 
formation of a francoamerican committee of artists to promote 
freedom of movement

marcus aurelius and his noble horse are back on the 
capitoline hill but the triumph was bittersweet pollution has 
forced the gilded bronze statue to abandon its glorious marble 
perch above the heart of rome 
the 1800yearold statue was removed nine years ago for 
cleaning and shoring up it was taken from the campidoglio the 
municipal square crowning the capitoline one of romes seven hills 
there it had rested upon a marble pedestal designed by 
michelangelo the renaissance genius who also laid out the square 
after six years of examination analyses and fundraising 
experts wielding lasers scalpels and brushes began actual 
restoration in the spring of 1987 the team brought back some shine 
to the imperial toga and saddle but it was soon clear that no 
technology existed to protect the treasure from the ravages of 
pollution and vibration in trafficfilled rome 
tests also showed that the weather is too humid for the 
19foothigh monument 
so the restored stoic emperor and his steed could not return to 
the spot michelangelo chose for them instead they were installed 
wednesday in a room its temperature and humidity carefully 
controlled in one of the palaces atop the hill that houses the 
capitoline museums 
in abandoning outdoor life marcus aurelius has illustrious 
company 
in florence the gilded panels on the east entrance to the 
cathedrals baptistry a door so beautiful michelangelo thought it 
was fit for paradise are destined for specially sealed chambers 
in a museum 
the four gilded bronze horses on the facade of st marks in 
venice were installed inside the church after restoration 
research is under way for a coating that would protect the 
marcus aurelius statue from the corrosive atmosphere and allow the 
emperor to take his place again in the square 
meanwhile the city is debating whether to put a replica atop 
the pedestal 
anna sommella director of archaeology for the capitoline 
museums says leaving the pedestal empty could remind the public of 
the price it is paying for polluted air 
a remedy must be found for the square and for all of rome 
she said as she watched workers unload marcus aurelius off a truck 
and push the upper half of the twoton monument slowly into the 
museum 
past city administrations have tried with little success to 
limit traffic in the historic center current mayor franco carraro 
a socialist was clearly ill at ease when asked what he could do 
about the problem 
we cant go backward even if we remove traffic there are 
other kinds of pollution heating fuels industry we cant be 
utopian in facing the problem said carraro 
romans would rather brave the four daily rush hours and 
inadequate parking than risk chancy public bus and streetcar 
service recurrent discoveries of underground relics have defeated 
ambitious subway plans 
moving marcus to the museum from the central restoration 
institute at san michele a former monastery across the tiber from 
city hall created its own traffic jam two flatbed trucks 
transported the statue 
the emperor his arm outstretched led the way his horse one 
front leg suspended in a graceful curve followed 
the public will be allowed inside the museum to see the statue 
as of april 21 the anniversary of romes founding 
legend has it that when the statues gilding disappears rome 
will cease to exist most of the gold coating cleaned in 
restoration has been added over the centuries in previous 
restoration only a few specks are original 
the work is the only known large equestrian statue surviving 
from ancient imperial days others were destroyed after 
christianity came to rome 
historians believe marcus aurelius statue survived because it 
was mistakenly identified as representing constantine the great 
the christian emperor 
it was originally placed near the lateran palace which had been 
a papal residence pope paul iii ordered it removed to the 
capitoline hill in 1538

astronomers used to name asteroids after 
classic greek and roman figures times change 
two lowell observatory astronomers have named four asteroids 
lennon mccartney harrison and starr 
brian skiff and edward bowell have been beatles fans for years 
so the names seemed natural for the asteroids discovered in 1983 
and 1984 during a photographic survey of the asteroid belt between 
mars and jupiter 
we thought it would be kind of nice to honor people who dont 
usually get recognized in space said bowell a native of england 
he said most asteroids now are named after eminent astronomers 
or scientists although harvard observatory astronomers in 
massachusetts named one after rock guitarist eric clapton 
bowell said asteroid finders have the right to name their 
discoveries abiding by a code which permits almost any name except 
those of politicians or religious figures skiff and bowell have 
named about 250 asteroids including shakespeare michelangelo and 
sagan for carl sagan 
the newly named asteroids range from five to 10 miles in 
diameter which is typical bowell said they are among 4461 
asteroids whose positions are accurately known

doctors decisions to give tests or take xrays 
depend in part on how much money they make on them a study today 
says 
the research supports the widely held but hard to document idea 
that doctors own financial interests play a role in determining 
the kind and amount of care they give their patients 
as in most professions money matters said david hemenway 
a harvard school of public health economist who directed the study 
the report in todays new england journal of medicine measured 
what happened when a chain of walkin clinics changed the way it 
paid its doctors instead of a flat hourly wage doctors could earn 
a percentage of all the fees they generated 
with this financial incentive they boosted the number of tests 
and xrays they performed by about 20 percent 
the study was conducted in 1984 and 1985 at bostonarea offices 
of health stop the nations biggest chain of walkin clinics with 
80 centers in six states 
nationwide about 4000 of these clinics have opened in the past 
decade they specialize in quick care for routine health 
complaints such as sprains and colds 
dr mark shankman health stops chief executive officer 
contended that the study was too small and flawed to draw 
conclusions but he agreed that financial incentives can influence 
the way doctors work 
patients needs differ and doctors honestly disagree over how 
much or how little care is enough especially when an extra 
test or two may rule out some remotely possible problem 
the new study suggests that when such uncertainty exists 
doctors may pile on the tests if they also profit from running up 
the bill 
there is a lot of leeway in what you can do said hemenway 
and when there are financial incentives some physicians change a 
little how they behave in their practice patterns 
during the period studied doctors were still guaranteed 
payments of 28 to 32 per hour depending on their age and 
experience but if their patients bills were high enough they 
received part of the gross receipts instead of their hourly pay 
they had the opportunity to keep 24 percent of the first 24000 of 
their patients monthly charges and 15 percent after that 
the researchers compared the behavior of 15 doctors during 
threemonth periods before and after the bonus system overall 
they performed 23 percent more xrays and 16 percent more tests 
after they became eligible for bonuses 
their total charges per month adjusted for inflation grew 20 
percent seven of the 15 doctors regularly earned bonuses and 
their pay rose 19 percent 
the study did not attempt to learn whether patients benefited or 
suffered from the extra medical care 
the implication is that part of the way doctors make decisions 
is the way they are paid said suzanne b cashman a coauthor of 
the study and a health services researcher at the boston university 
health policy institute 
shankman cited several shortcomings in the study besides the 
small number of doctors reviewed among them 
even before the bonus system began the chain had a 
profitsharing program that provided a financial incentive to do 
more 
a widely used sore throat test became available during the 
study period and this could have accounted for some of the 
additional testing 
one of the doctors studied had a sharp increase in xray use 
because he transferred to an office where he concentrated on 
occupational medicine which requires frequent xrays to diagnose 
workrelated injuries 
the latest study is part of a much larger examination of medical 
practices patient satisfaction and physician attitudes at health 
stop 
a lot of them said they didnt like it because of the pressure 
for money money money said hemenway of former and current 
health stop doctors they felt it was a problem

democrat ann richards overcame allegations of 
drug abuse to win the gubernatorial nomination in texas but 
analysts say voters can be fickle about judging politicians with 
drugs in their past 
age sex and the drug of choice all may have something to do 
with it they say and so can the candidates opponent 
accusations of drug abuse and related character attacks so 
dominated the fourweek texas gubernatorial runoff between ms 
richards and state attorney general jim mattox that one commentator 
said the contest had sunk from the gutters to the sewers 
but the same issue created few ripples in massachusetts where 
11 politicians last month admitted they had tried marijuana and 
similar admissions appeared to play no role in the losing 1988 
presidential campaigns of democrats bruce babbitt and al gore 
just last week the senate approved timothy ryan as the nations 
chief savings and loan regulator after senators displayed little 
concern that he had tried marijuana and cocaine while in law school 
in texas mattox pursued ms richards relentlessly on the drug 
issue after she refused to say whether she had used illegal drugs 
did she use marijuana or something worse like cocaine not 
as a college kid but as a 47yearold elected official sworn to 
uphold the law mattox asked in one television ad later he 
alleged outright that ms richards the state treasurer once had a 
cocaine addiction but by the end he too was fighting off drug 
use allegations 
still to be seen is whether the drug issue will dog richards in 
her general election contest against republican clayton williams 
analysts say there are many potential difficulties starting with 
her age at 56 she is substantially older than the generation 
usually associated with and excused for experimental drug use 
anything you did before 25 is to be forgiven even if it was 
only 10 years ago said democratic consultant tony podesta but 
if you indulged your drug fantasies when you were 47 it sounds a 
lot different 
the issue also is harder to overcome for women analysts said 
because people generally tolerate freewheeling behavior more easily 
in men than in women in ms richards case they note the 
allegations also contrast sharply with the grandmotherly image she 
tried to project in her ads 
the particular drug at issue also matters with voters 
william schneider a political analyst at the american 
enterprise institute said occasional or infrequent marijuana use 
if not forgiven is at least understood by voters but cocaine 
is a different story 
if it was only marijuana she would have said so schneider 
said richards a recovering alcoholic told voters she had used no 
moodaltering chemicals in the past 10 years but refused to 
say what if any drugs she had used previously 
ms richards won anyway but analysts said the texas race was a 
flawed test of whether voters will be forgiving of past drug use 
charles cook editor of cooks political report cited mattoxs 
attackdog style his failure to release his income tax returns and 
the lastminute allegations that he had smoked marijuana 
it wasnt a situation where you had allegations about drug use 
by one candidate and the other candidate seemed pure as the driven 
snow cook said 
both candidates ended up with high negatives because of the 
drug issue said jill buckley a democratic communications 
consultant 
buckley and others said voters found ms richards the less 
offensive candidate because she started the race with a reputation 
for decency and there was a sense she was being unfairly hammered 
on drugs 
in contrast with texas ryans law school experiments with 
marijuana and cocaine recounted in a leaked fbi report were all 
but ignored when the senate confirmed him last week to head the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
senators were quick to condemn the leak and defend the nominee 
mostly on the grounds of his age which is 44 
whatever ryan did ended 17 years ago said sen bob dole 
rkan if he is to be held up to that standard then we are going 
to wipe out a generation of men and women who are about that age 
who may have experimented at one time or another with some type of 
drug 
podesta said some of the same dynamics were at work in 
massachusetts when a crowd of politicians including a senator 
two congressmen and five candidates for state office confessed to 
past dalliances with drugs the public appeared to respond with a 
mass so what 
you have a younger generation of politicians a more liberal 
social atmosphere heavily influenced by the academic community 
podesta said

president bush is refusing to recognize 
lithuanias breakaway government fearing a replay of 1956 when the 
united states rooted for hungarys uprising but stayed on the 
sidelines as soviet tanks crushed the revolt his spokesman says 
bush in a meeting with balticamericans on wednesday rejected 
their plea for us recognition of lithuania as independent from 
the soviet union 
the balticamericans told the president that lithuania is only 
the beginning of soviet troubles they said separatist movements 
will be boiling over in latvia and estonia by the time soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev arrives here for his summit with 
bush at the end of may 
the latvians will be declaring independence in two weeks 
estonia is in the same process by the time we get to the summit 
we will have a situation in all three republics which is comparable 
to what is happening today in lithuania said ojars kalnins of 
the american latvian association 
but white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bushs 
policy on lithuania is the correct one and it does not involve 
recognition 
he said the president wants to avoid taking actions that would 
inadvertently make lithuanias task more difficult by inflaming the 
situation 
bush he said mentioned hungary in 1956 as an example of the 
situation that he wanted to avoid a situation in which the united 
states supported the protest there and the movement there and then 
the soviet union put it down by force and we were unable to do 
anything in support of our convictions 
and he indicated that he did not want to precipitate a 
situation in which that would create the use of force or that 
similarly would cause us to be unable to act fitzwater said 
the president has consistently voiced support for lithuanias 
independence move because the united states never officially 
recognized the soviet unions 1940 annexation of the three baltic 
republics 
but even as he has warned gorbachev that a crackdown or 
repression in lithuania would harm a range of ussoviet 
relations bush has refrained from harsh criticism in favor of 
repeatedly calling for dialogue and peaceful resolution 
bush also has pointed out that gorbachev deserves credit for 
allowing the democratic reforms in eastern europe and changes 
within the soviet union 
he said as much to the balticamericans on wednesday crediting 
gorbachevs policies with allowing the atmosphere whereby 
lithuania could consider its future in a different light because of 
glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring said 
fitzwater 
the balticamericans said they were disappointed that bush was 
unwilling to recognize the government of lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis or to give de facto recognition a step 
short of official recognition 
mariann rikken of the estonianamerican national council 
characterized the president as looking to find a way out a way 
out of the soviet union for the baltic states that will not result 
in a cataclysm for the soviet union and that will not result in a 
blood bath for the baltic states 
fitzwater said bush pointed out in forceful terms that the 
united states approaches this problem with many ramifications to 
consider 
lithuania and hungary are not exactly parallel situations 
lithuania is trying to secede from the soviet union while hungary 
was an independent country under soviet influence its government 
was seen as a soviet puppet and when anticommunist revolts began 
in 1956 the soviet union quickly and violently quashed them

the bush administration is preparing a 
proposal to ease restrictions on sales of hightechnology items to 
the emerging democracies of eastern europe but the changes likely 
will not go far enough to satisfy western allies 
commerce undersecretary dennis kloske who supervises export 
control activities said wednesday there was growing agreement in 
the administration over the actions needed to provide western 
technology to the struggling economies of poland hungary and other 
former communist bloc countries 
the administration is conducting a review and recommendations 
on what changes can be made without jeopardizing national security 
should be presented to president bush by the end of this month 
kloske said 
there is an emerging consensus inside the administration that 
the changing developments in eastern europe will allow for a 
significant level of streamlining of export controls kloske told 
business executives attending a us chamber of commerce trade 
seminar 
speaking to reporters later kloske said the administration 
strongly believes the soviet union should not be allowed access to 
the same level of technology being offered to other east european 
nations 
the administration also is insisting that eastern european 
countries sign agreements that guarantee that the hightechnology 
products would not fall into soviet hands such agreements also 
would provide for onsite inspection by western officials 
kloske said the new governments of east germany poland 
hungary czechoslovakia and bulgaria have indicated a willingness 
to adopt enforcement programs to meet us demands 
us allies especially west germany believe the administration 
is still being too restrictive the allies have been pushing for 
even more liberalization on exports to eastern europe and many 
believe the soviets also should be allowed access to western 
hightech products as a way of supporting president mikhail 
gorbachevs economic reforms 
but kloske said the situation in the soviet union was still too 
volatile other administration officials have said the soviet 
crackdown in lithuania may have strengthened the administrations 
bargaining position 
the soviets are not going to receive preferential treatment 
overnight or any time soon kloske predicted 
sales of hightechnology products to the soviet union and 
countries in the eastern bloc are regulated by the coordinating 
committee on multilateral export controls the 17nation cocom 
group is composed of americas west european allies and japan and 
australia 
cocom was created during the cold war to make sure that 
technology with military uses did not fall into communist hands 
the united states has lately found itself isolated in the 
organization resisting demands for much swifter relaxation of 
export controls 
the parisbased cocom is scheduled to take up rules changes 
again during a june 78 meeting and kloske said that session could 
well decide the fate of the entire export review process 
if we cannot reach agreement in june we begin to run a 
serious risk that the allies will begin shipping to east europe 
on their own he said 
the administration is reviewing a proposal that would provide 
eastern european countries with the same level of technology that 
is now being sold to china in the areas of computers machine tools 
and telecommunications equipment 
earlier this week the soviet union made a strong bid to the 
west to rethink its position on blocking soviet access to the 
technology the country needs to modernize its economy 
stepan sitarian a deputy soviet premier told a conference in 
bonn west germany that the soviets would be willing to agree to 
inspection procedures so the west could verify that hightechnology 
equipment was not being used for military purposes 
kloske said the administration might be willing to consider 
liberalizing technology shipments to the soviets in clearly 
civilian nonstrategic areas such as agriculture or textiles

arms control progress is being chilled by the 
collapse of the soviet position in eastern europe the unsettling 
prospect of a united germany and unrest in three baltic republics 
four specialists say 
assessing last weeks inconclusive talks between soviet foreign 
minister euard a shevardnadze and secretary of state james a 
baker iii the arms control advocates agreed there was little 
progress and some regression on key issues in strategic and 
conventional talks 
i think the main reason has been the shock effect of the 
events in eastern europe and east germany on soviet thinking 
former arms control negotiator john dean told reporters 
while the strategic arms reduction treaty or start talks 
should have no logical connection with events in eastern europe 
theres bound to be something of a psychic impact dean said 
the negotiating climate also has been complicated by the us 
suggestion of moving quickly to ban mobile landbased 
multiplewarhead missiles the experts said 
to open up the mirv multiplewarhead issue now means there 
will not be an early start treaty said spurgeon keeney 
president of the privately funded arms control association 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev open 
their summit meeting in washington on may 30 but keeney said 
there is no chance there will be a start agreement by the time 
of the summit and the main problem now is if there can even be an 
agreement in principle by then 
but keeney and the others gave bush high marks for continuing to 
emphasize the importance of reaching agreements with moscow despite 
political pressure for him to more aggressively support lithuanias 
recent declaration of independence 
also addressing the arms control issue were paul warnke former 
director of the arms control and disarmament agency and jack 
mendelsohn the arms control associations deputy director 
keeney said that while both bush and gorbachev clearly want arms 
control agreements as quickly as possible an apparent earlier 
consensus on how to deal with such strategic weapons as 
airlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles now appears to have 
been premature 
the soviets are raising serious questions on how to verify each 
sides declarations about the nature of such weapons including 
their range and whether they are armed with conventional or nuclear 
warheads keeney said 
warnke said he believes the consideration of a ban on multiple 
warheads on missiles should await a second phase of the start talks 
if we do want start i we shouldnt throw this particular 
wrinkle in he said 
warnke said there has been a toughening in the soviet 
position overall 
some suggest this is due to the baltic chill caused by 
soviet efforts to quell the independence movement in lithuania and 
the simultaneous moves toward independence in neighboring estonia 
and latvia he said 
the state of superpower relations does have an impact on 
negotiations warnke said and added there is speculation that 
the soviet military is taking more of a role out of concern over 
the concessions their negotiators have made to date 
but he said others feel the soviets are just employing good 
negotiating tactics as the start talks near their end 
dean said there also has been a recent slowdown by the soviets 
in the vienna talks aimed at reducing conventional forces and arms 
in central europe 
progress on most issues is hanging fire and there is major 
difficulty on the issue of reducing soviet and western aircraft 
said dean who now is arms control adviser to the union of 
concerned scientists 
soviet negotiators have not been receiving fresh instructions 
dean said he said reasons for the delay include soviet leaders 
preoccupation with other issues the hardening of soviet positions 
and the collapse of the soviet position in eastern europe and in 
east germany 
keeney said part of the blame may rest with unrealistic us 
expectations after a series of soviet arms control concessions 
while it may be correct that the soviets have dug in their 
heels its also true that the united states had reached the 
conclusion that the soviets would accept any reasonable proposal we 
put forward dean added that may have been unreasonable 
mendelsohn suggested there may be little progress on reducing 
conventional forces in central europe until the soviets know what 
will happen in a united germany

researchers have uncovered details of a gene 
from a magnolia tree that lived in idaho about 20 million years 
ago by far the oldest plant or animal tissue ever to yield that 
information 
the genetic material came from leaf samples that were 
exceptionally well preserved by an ancient lake researchers 
reported today in the british journal nature 
such analysis can shed light on the relationships between 
extinct species and their presentday descendants helping 
researchers construct the scientific equivalent of family trees 
the new report demonstrates an opportunity to take a new 
technology and apply it to the study of classical problems in 
biology said study coauthor michael clegg of the university of 
california at riverside 
he did the work with postdoctoral student edward golenberg and 
others at the university and scientists at the university of 
georgia in athens the university of idaho in moscow and the dnax 
research institute in palo alto calif 
the leaf samples from an excavation in the panhandle area of 
northern idaho were from 17 million to 20 million years old 
the oldest material that previously had yielded to similar 
genetic analysis was human brain tissue about 7000 years old 
recovered from a bog in florida clegg said in a recent telephone 
interview 
genetic material called deoxyribonucleic acid or dna was 
extracted from leaf samples and a part of it was duplicated 
repeatedly using a technique called polymerase chain reaction 
researchers determined its chemical makeup and found that the dna 
was from a gene that acted as a blueprint for part of a particular 
plant protein 
the fact that we could do it once probably means it can be 
done again with materials from other sites clegg said 
the leaf samples were exceptionally well preserved having 
fallen into a cold lake that rapidly silted in the cold and the 
low amounts of oxygen available helped preserve the leaves he said 
it is unclear how many other sites could offer such 
wellpreserved specimens for dna analysis he said 
but the new report suggests the idaho site itself may provide 
an extraordinarily wellpreserved assemblage of fossils that 
could yield an abundance of information much like the famed la 
brea pits said karl niklas botany professor at cornell university 
in ithaca 
the la brea pits in los angeles are one of the worlds richest 
known sources of ice age fossils 
clegg said dna work has begun with other leaves from the site 
the site contained remnants of more than 100 species of plants 
perhaps half were preserved in somewhat the same way as the 
magnolia leaves and dna might be recovered from some of them said 
study coauthor charles smiley of the university of idaho 
the site also contained 30 to 40 kinds of insects some of which 
still had their original colors and four kinds of fish he said 
but it is unclear what their potential for dna analysis would be 
he said 
niklas said that if other remains from the same site could be 
made to reveal genetic details it would reveal an unique slice 
through time based on dna analysis thats an extremely 
exciting possibility

an experimental aids drug injected into two 
pregnant monkeys reached their fetuses raising hope that it might 
block aids virus infection of human babies by their mothers 
scientists said today 
if used early enough in pregnancy it might ward off perinatal 
aids infection said study coauthor daniel capon of genentech inc 
of south san francisco 
the drug reached the fetuses about as easily as a human mothers 
natural proteins do as they build up disease resistance within 
babies researchers said 
the drug called a cd4 immunoadhesin has shown promise against 
the aids virus in the test tube but its effectiveness in people is 
not yet known 
the standard aids drug azt can also reach fetuses crossing the 
placenta quite well said james balsley of the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
researchers are testing azts safety in pregnant women and plan 
to test whether it can block perinatal transmission of the aids 
virus he said wednesday 
some 1734 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 
infants who were infected by their mothers have been recorded by 
the federal centers for disease control scientists do not know 
details of how babies are infected but many infections appear to 
happen during pregnancy with some during birth 
a child born to an aidsinfected woman runs a 20 percent to 40 
percent risk of being infected by the mother studies suggest 
the new work is reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by capon and others at genentech and jerome groopman and 
colleagues at harvard medical school and new england deaconess 
hospital in boston 
the immunoadhesin they studied is a manmade hybrid of parts of 
two natural proteins one protein called cd4 is found on the 
surface of some cells in the body the other protein an 
immunoglobulin plays a key role in the bodys diseasefighting 
immune system 
the new study and previous research show that in the test tube 
immunoadhesins can block the aids virus from infecting cells and 
can trigger the killing of infected cells while leaving healthy 
cells alone 
to test the drugs ability to cross the placenta researchers 
injected two rhesus monkeys near the end of their gestational 
periods with immunoadhesins and then infused more drug for 24 hours 
before performing caesarian sections 
blood from the newborns contained about 3 percent of the 
concentration of immunoadhesins that their mothers blood had 
researchers reported other experiments have shown that natural 
maternal immunoglobulins reach human fetuses at about the same 
rate study authors said 
with maternal immunoglobulins capon said the fetal level 
builds up over time a similar accumulation of immunoadhesins might 
occur if the drug is given early enough in pregnancy he said 
gwendolyn scott of the university of miami school of medicine 
who is studying perinatal aids virus infection called the 
immunoadhesin idea an exciting concept in terms of perhaps 
another way that perinatal transmission might be interrupted 
questions about safety of the fetus would have to be studied 
she said in a telephone interview

a projected increase of up to 50 percent in 
average global concentrations of the pollutant ozone over the next 
30 years would make little difference in us cities with an ozone 
problem a scientist says 
about 100 areas in the united states fail to meet federal 
standards for ozone levels including essentially all major cities 
according to the us environmental protection agency 
but the projected global average increase would have only a 
minor impact on american cities because local pollution is the main 
cause of their ozone troubles said scientist brian ridley of the 
national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
ozone is a form of oxygen that plays a jekyllandhyde role in 
the atmosphere at high altitudes it shields earth from solar rays 
that can promote skin cancer but near the earths surface it is a 
pollutant that irritates sensitive lung tissues and harms crops 
lowaltitude ozone is created by nitrogen oxides and 
hydrocarbons that come from automobile exhaust and industrial 
sources 
ridley was commenting on a study in todays issue of the british 
journal nature that projected an increase of 21 percent to 50 
percent in average global levels of lowaltitude ozone by the year 
2020 
he also cautioned that such projections are uncertain because of 
lack of scientific knowledge about such factors as the distribution 
of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere 
the increase dealt with concentrations at the earths surface 
over land only study coauthor adrian hough said in an interview 
he and richard derwent did the projections at the harwell 
laboratory in didcot england 
hough said local ozone control measures may have to be more 
stringent if the projected increase takes place because local 
ozone readings reflect this background level as well as local 
pollution 
one projection focused on latitudes typical of the central 
united states it found a rise in annual averages from about 30 
parts per billion today to perhaps 35 parts or 45 parts per billion 
in the year 2020 hough said 
under epa criteria an area fails to comply with the ozone 
standard if it exceeds 120 parts per billion for more than an 
average of once a year over a threeyear period 
hough said the main factor behind the calculated rise in overall 
global ozone is increased emissions from industrialization and 
automobile use in developing nations

education department officials are reluctant 
to predict a new trend in student loan defaults but trade school 
officials are claiming some credit for a 17 percentage point drop 
in the rate 
our problem with student loan defaults is too serious for 
hasty judgments about trends in the default rate said leonard l 
haynes iii assistant secretary for postsecondary education the 
figures for fiscal year 1988 the latest available are encouraging 
but not yet decisive he said 
we want to evaluate these data thoroughly before we draw any 
conclusions haynes said 
education department data show the overall default rate dropped 
to 156 percent in fiscal year 1988 from 173 percent in 1987 in 
fiscal 1986 the default rate was 21 percent 
for fiscal 1988 385000 borrowers who were supposed to begin 
repaying defaulted on a total of 107 billion in loans while 246 
million borrowers entered repayment on guaranteed student loans 
totaling 923 billion 
in 1987 223 million borrowers entered repayment while 
defaulted loans due that year totaled 398000 
larry oxendine acting director of policy and program 
development for the department estimated the total of all 
defaulted loans at about 10 billion the government has lent about 
90 billion during the 25 years of the program 
stephen blair president of the national association of trade 
and technical schools said a quick scan of the department data 
shows a significant drop in the number of defaults of trade school 
loans 
trade and other proprietary schools have been blamed in recent 
years for the spiraling student loan default rates some have been 
accused of using unscrupulous recruiting tactics to lure students 
to the schools just so they can get the federal money 
we began a major national initiative four years ago to reduce 
loan defaults at private career schools and out of that we believe 
the reduction is due in part to our efforts said blair 
haynes said many factors contributed to the reduction in the 
overall default rate including increased school default prevention 
efforts a dramatic increase in the number of supplemental loans to 
students entering repayment plus technical changes in the 
calculations 
according to haynes more than half of the total reduction came 
through excluding foreign schools or those with fewer than 30 
borrowers as well as institutions that are defunct unaccredited 
or have withdrawn from the program 
of the 5226 institutions tracked by the education department 
more than 70 percent had default rates under 20 percent haynes 
said schools whose former students default rates are above 20 
percent must establish default management plans approved and 
monitored by the department 
as an institutions default rate goes higher additional 
measures are required including a 30day delay in release of loan 
funds to firsttime borrowers and prorata tuition refunds 
beginning in 1991 schools with default rates above 60 percent 
are subject to expulsion from the federal student aid programs 
roberta dunn deputy assistant education secretary for student 
financial assistance said 1127 institutions with default rates of 
between 20 percent and 40 percent submitted management plans last 
year that were eventually approved an additional 482 schools have 
rates higher than 40 percent 
institutions with defaults of 70 percent or higher include tom 
nolans chrysler academy school decatur ill 759 percent 
defaults totaling 175322 cannella school of hair design 
chicago 734 percent 420440 stevensons academy of hair new 
orleans 758 percent 108057 cambridge technical institute 
dayton ohio 815 percent 8282384 and easons institute of 
technology san antonio 795 percent 737442

a car bombing 
dozens of explosions were heard throughout the city immediately 
after the power was cut wednesday night the blackout affected 
cities and towns along 560 miles of the coast 
the car bomb that killed the policeman exploded on one of limas 
main avenues in front of a private club that police frequent 
limas top radio station reported 
almost simultaneously six people were injured in a blast at the 
downtown offices of the university of san martin next to the lima 
election board the station reported four people were arrested 
immediately after the attack 
a police spokesman said details of the bombings were not 
available 
witnesses said fires in the shape of the hammer and sickle were 
burning in the mountains outside blackedout lima 
guerrillas of the maoistinspired shining path frequently bomb 
power pylons leading authorities to devise elaborate means for 
protecting them that have included high fences and land mines 
the bombings and blackout came three days after the first round 
of presidential elections the elections sent novelist mario vargas 
llosa and political newcomer alfredo fujimori into a runoff that 
will probably be held in early june 
the shining path had announced plans to sabotage the elections

the army says an investigator will decide 
whether a murder charge lodged against a paratrooper in connection 
with the panama invasion should be forwarded for a possible 
courtmartial 
first sgt roberto enrique bryan a member of the 82nd airborne 
division based at fort bragg nc faces a charge of premeditated 
murder of a panamanian man and three counts of aggravated assault 
army spokesman maj joe padilla said 
it is the most serious action taken by army officials against a 
soldier in the aftermath of decembers us invasion of panama 
padilla said 
the charges are expected to be referred to an investigating 
officer who will recommend whether the case should be forwarded to 
maj gen james h johnson jr commander of the 82nd airborne 
johnson will decide whether a courtmartial should be convened 
army officials said 
under the uniform code of military justice the maximum penalty 
for premeditated murder is death or life imprisonment dishonorable 
discharge forfeiture of all pay and allowances and reduction in 
rank 
bryan 42 was born in panama and was sent there with the 82nd 
airborne in the dec 20 effort to oust panamanian dictator gen 
manuel antonio noriega padilla said 
the soldier is not being held in detention and is being 
represented by a military lawyer the spokesman said 
bryan was the senior enlisted man in his unit a headquarters 
company such units were deployed to panama to handle such things 
as supply and organizational matters padilla said 
the spokesman said bryan is charged with the murder of an 
unidentified panamanian man allegedly by shooting him with an 
m16 rifle on or about dec 23 at or near madden dam which is 
outside panama city 
the three other charges allege aggravated assault against 
unidentified panamanian men at the same location 
one case involved a man who allegedly was struck in the hand 
with the butt of an m16 rifle on or about dec 20 one man who 
allegedly was struck in the head with the butt of an m16 on or 
about dec 20 and a man who allegedly was struck in the back with 
a section of rubber hose on or about dec 21 the army said 
although padilla said he could not comment on the circumstances 
surrounding the incidents the army times newspaper reported 
earlier this month that the shooting occurred after a skirmish at a 
roadblock when a group of panamanians were stopped in a car and 
someone threw a hand grenade at the soldiers 
the us soldiers then fired on the car killing some of the 
occupants the remaining occupants surrendered got out and were 
taken prisoner but one of the prisoners allegedly was shot and 
another severely beaten the army times reported the publication 
is an independent weekly 
the charges came about as a result of an investigation by the 
us army criminal investigation command padilla said

doctors hope to reduce the complications of sickle 
cell disease by prompting the body to produce a substance that it 
ordinarily stops making after birth 
the experimental treatment involves the drug hydroxyurea a 
medicine approved for treating melanoma and some other forms of 
cancer 
sickle cell victims make defective hemoglobin the substance in 
red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body in the new 
treatment doctors induced the body to make fetal hemoglobin which 
ordinarily is present in large quantities only before birth 
but the treatment only slightly reduced anemia a common 
complication of sickle cell disease the doctors cautioned that 
more study of the drugs longterm effects and hazards will be 
necessary before they know whether it will play a role in treating 
the ailment 
the study was conducted by dr griffin p rodgers and colleagues 
from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney 
diseases and johns hopkins university school of medicine it was 
published in todays new england journal of medicine 
in seven of 10 people given the drug for three months levels of 
fetal hemoglobin in red blood cells rose by two to 10 times this 
resulted in a 25 percent reduction in the tendency of their 
hemoglobin to polymerize or form long fibers which gives the red 
cells a distorted shape 
the doctors speculated that if they could achieve a 50 percent 
reduction in the tendency to polymerize they could significantly 
reduce the complications of sickle cell disease 
in the united states the disease is most common among blacks 
where it occurs in about one of every 1000 people 
doctors are also studying the possibility of using the cancer 
drug to treat thalassemia another inherited blood disorder

president bushs call to remove 
tens of thousands of american troops from west germany has been 
matched or surpassed by the increasing eagerness of west 
germans to see them go 
once scorned as antiamericanism the wish to see the 
massive us military presence sharply reduced has picked up the 
support of two state governments 
before people were reprimanded for saying such a thing out 
loud says hans jacobs deputy mayor of bitburg he says now 
the time has come to plan a future with a far smaller number of 
us troops 
bitburg home to a us air force base is also the town where 
former president ronald reagan made a bitterly criticized visit to 
a german war cemetery in 1985 
jacobs says he looks forward to a possible civilian use for the 
air base and less noise from fighter jets screeching overhead 
tourism would also pick up if there werent so many troops 
around he said jacobs says the 13500 americans there outnumber 
west germans 
president bushs proposal to withdraw 57000 of the 
quartermillion american soldiers stationed in west germany has 
sparked political wrangling over which areas should be the first to 
see substantial withdrawals 
the activities of us and other nato troops have led to 
numerous protests in recent years especially as resistance grew to 
lowlevel training flights 
the roaring flights wake children shake houses scare cows and 
generally make life miserable for those in the training areas 
frequent military maneuvers also chew up farmers fields and 
lead to massive traffic jams on already crowded highways 
many west germans have long chafed at such a massive us troop 
presence as an obstacle to full national sovereignty and the 
collapse of communist regimes to the east now has them feeling less 
threatened than ever 
west german officials are even eyeing a us pullout as a way to 
open housing for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from eastern 
europe the social democratic mayor of frankfurt says he hopes to 
turn a huge military shopping area into a city housing development 
on tuesday munichs sueddeutsche zeitung daily newspaper 
reported that environmentalists have demanded the closing of a huge 
army practice range near the bavarian city of regensburg they want 
it turned into a nature preserve 
hesse state gov walter wallmann has made an outright appeal for 
the removal of us troops from frankfurt and nearby erbenheim 
in a letter last week to chancellor helmut kohl a fellow 
christian democrat wallmann said the american facilities are 
needed to keep up with european competition in economic areas 
the hesse governor told kohl a fellow christian democratic 
that he would even like to have the sprawling rheinmain us air 
base outside frankfurt turned over to the west germans 
wallmanns bluntly worded letter would have been unthinkable 
just months ago from a member of the west german party with the 
closest ties to washington 
frankfurt is jockeying to become the home of the central bank of 
an economically integrated europe thus attracting even more 
business to the glittering financial center 
the citys mayor volker hauff would like the americans to give 
up a huge shopping area which includes a bustling burger king 
restaurant to turn the site into a city housing development 
carlludwig wagner the christian democratic governor of the 
western state of rhinelandpalatinate where bitburg is located is 
also seeking us troop cutbacks 
wagner has presented a list of 12 military us bases and 
facilities for possible closure 
most west germans accept that us troops will be stationed in 
their country for some time and many west germans warn that the 
financial impact of pullouts from smaller areas could be especially 
severe 
in rhinelandpalatinate us bases contribute from 26 billion 
to 41 billion annually to the state once one of west germanys 
poorest about 68000 american troops and 75000 family members are 
in the state and 21500 west germans are in the employ of the 
states us military facilities 
nato commander john r galvin has been making tv commercials for 
the us military to try to calm concerns about the future of us 
forces in west germany according to a military spokesman 
theres a lot of rumors said army maj david compton of the 
us military headquarters in stuttgart 
he said galvin still has not made any formal troop cutback plan

the american telegraph amp telephone co will 
begin its first phone service from the united states to albania 
next month 
the albanian link will leave vietnam cambodia and north korea 
as the only major nations without telephone service with the united 
states atampt spokesman herb linnen said wednesday 
albanias hardline communist government began allowing calls 
from albania to go through on march 24 linnen said he said 
operatorassisted calls from the united states to albania will be 
put through starting sometime in may depending on federal 
communications commission approval and directdial service will 
begin in the fall 
linnen said atampt also has a petition before the treasury 
department to allow formal negotiations with vietnam for the first 
phone service with that country since the end of the vietnam war 
he said vietnam which has no diplomatic relations with the 
united states has shown a willingness to resume phone service in 
preliminary talks with atampt representatives atampt needs a license 
for the formal negotiations because of the us trade embargo 
against hanoi 
when we see countries that cannot be reached from the united 
states our objective is to start up service regardless of 
whatever political situations that exist he said 
we have nothing going on right now with cambodia and north 
korea but clearly our objective is that since they are not served 
we want to be able to do that in time said linnen 
albania on the coast of the adriatic sea north of greece has 
not gone through the governmental reforms seen in other eastern 
european communist nations although there have been growing 
demonstrations for change

the agriculture department says smallscale 
farmers who have woodlots on their property sometimes dont realize 
that money does grow on trees 
and if you want to start from scratch and wait 15 to 50 years 
depending on the region newly planted trees eventually can return 
a profit 
experts say at least 6 million people own woodlots averaging 40 
to 50 acres they make up about onethird of the nations 348 
million acres of private timberland 
the woodlot possibilities are described in a fact sheet by the 
office for smallscale agriculture which is operated by usdas 
cooperative state research service 
previous topics have included sheep goats mushrooms foliage 
plants herbs wildflowers herbs specialty vegetables and 
exotic livestock such as ostriches llamas alpacas water 
buffalo and european fallow deer 
many can improve their land management the report said 
this fact sheet is intended mainly for them rather than for 
others who may want to try to get into the business 
but there are newcomers to woodlot management including many 
farmers who are planting trees on more than 2 million acres under 
the governments conservation reserve program 
the program offers initial planting assistance and annual rental 
payments to farmers who agree to take highly erodible cropland from 
production for 10 years and protect it with grass and trees 
a number of other federal and state programs along with private 
efforts are directed at woodlot improvements 
most woodlot farmers dont fully manage their operations and 
timber growth generally reaches only 50 percent to 60 percent of 
potential the report said good management means getting each acre 
to produce the maximum annual growth possible and to replace 
harvested trees 
owners with already established woodlots often have immediate 
income potential the report said sometimes however the 
return covers decades

government weather watchers say much of the 
drought across the great plains has been eased since the first of 
the year 
a weekly weather and crop report wednesday by the commerce and 
agriculture departments said last month was mild and wet across 
much of the united states historically it was the 10th warmest 
and 35th wettest march on record 
however the report said unusually dry conditions prevailed 
over the northeast northwest and west last month 
rainfall during the past three months has erased the moisture 
deficit accumulated in late 1989 across most of the primary hard 
red winter wheat region extending from southern and western 
nebraska to the texas panhandle the report said 
statewide precipitation figures for january february and march 
showed wet conditions extended through alabama arkansas iowa 
kansas louisian mississippi missouri oklahoma and texas for 
alabama louisiana and oklahoma it was the wettest first quarter 
on record 
but in contrast to the wetness of southern and central states 
the report said the west had unusually dry rainy season and 
that october through march ranks as the third driest such period on 
record 
there were 130 tornadoes across the continuous united states 
in march 1990 the report said this is the second highest 
figure for march since 1953

maneuvering his fenderless volkswagen through 
limas dusty streets taxi driver segundo flores gutierrez 
explained why he has become an ardent supporter of presidenital 
candidate alberto fujimori 
hell bring us japanese money technology ethics well be 
totally orientalized 
but others believe fujimori 51 is just another peruvian with 
little to back up his claims that he can capitalize on his japanese 
heritage to rebuild the nations faltering economy 
the son of japanese immigrants was virtually unknown to 
peruvians a month ago now hes favored to become the next 
president after forcing frontrunner and celebrated novelist mario 
vargas llosa into a runoff 
vargas llosa was hoping for a majority in sundays balloting but 
received just 32 percent of the vote fujimori with less than 6 
percent voter support in the polls a month ago soared to second in 
a field of nine candidates and won nearly 30 percent of the vote 
now vargas llosa is considering bowing out and giving fujimori 
the presidency 
fujimori made a strong showing by raising the hopes in millions 
of voters in this impoverished nation ravaged by a decadeold 
insurgency by the maoistinspired shining path 
part of his appeal is that he has never held political office 
fujimori is new and independent our other politicians are all 
used up exhausted said a candy vendor who supported vargas 
llosa until three days before the election 
vargas llosa is also new to politics but was faulted by voters 
for his affiliation with traditional rightwing parties analysts 
say he also was too frank in detailing his plan for harsh austerity 
measures 
people who know fujimori best say he is a natural politician 
he speaks english french and german as well as spanish and 
japanese he was no 1 in his graduating class of agricultural 
engineers in 1961 he did postgraduate work at the university of 
wisconsin and the university of strasburg in france 
but he attended high school in a workingclass neighborhood and 
his immigrant father fed the family by working as a tailor and a 
night watchman 
that background gives him a common touch that he has used with 
perus poor 
hes a consummate politician an absolute expert at 
manipulating people says an administrator at the national 
agricultural university where fujimori was as rector from 1984 
until last year the administrator asked not to be identified by 
name 
fujimori has said that as a japaneseperuvian he would be 
better able to attract japanese aid to peru that claim has 
irritated japans ambassador to peru according to diplomatic 
sources 
many professors at the national agricultural university say that 
as rector fujimori relied solely on perus bankrupt government 
instead of seeking foreign aid for the school 
he never made any contacts with international groups that 
support agricultural research one professor said 
a member of the administration who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said how can he claim that hell attract japanese 
money to peru theres not a single yen in this whole university 
limas large japanese community has been somewhat surprised by 
fujimoris campaign which has played on the peruvian stereotype of 
japanese as being honest and hardworking 
his popularity is very surprising said juan iida publisher 
of a japaneselanguage newspaper in lima we didnt even know who 
he was 
many in the japanese community says fujimoris values are more 
peruvian than japanese and some who have worked with him 
question his ability to resurrect perus shattered economy 
former colleagues at the university for instance criticize his 
management of the school at one point they say 200 of the 
universitys milk cows dried up for lack of food and water 
critics say fujimori was ultimately responsible for ensuring 
proper care for the cows supporters say the national government 
was at fault because it withheld funds 
the same accusations are made about four laboratory buildings 
that stand halffinished in the middle of the universitys campus 
fujimori himself appears to have no doubts about his chances of 
being elected president and governing the nation of 22 million 
even while barely a blip on pollsters charts he confidently 
predicted to anyone listening that he would win the election 
along with their four children fujimori and his wife susana 
higuchi run their own threeacre farm of which the candidate 
proudly speaks when claiming he will revitalize peruvian 
agriculture 
but even if fujimori cannot increase the yield of perus farms 
now strangled by drought rebel fighting and a poor economy or 
attract japanese help some peruvians still support him 
the japanese are the most patient people in the world a 
waiter in a lima restaurant said they know how to live on rice 
and water and before long that may be just what peruvians will 
need to learn

the bush administration says a soviet bid to 
make a united germany a member of both nato and the warsaw pact is 
an unacceptable formula for neutrality that could lead to future 
instability in europe 
president bush firmly believes that german membership in the 
north atlantic treaty organization alone is the best guarantee 
for longterm peace and continued stability white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
that germany should be a member of nato and the warsaw pact is 
another formula for neutrality fitzwater said 
it is a status that we believe the germans themselves and 
their neighbors believe is undesirable he said and added we 
strongly support full membership of a united germany in nato we 
are opposed to neutrality 
the negative white house reaction which was echoed at the state 
department followed a soviet proposal for dual german membership 
in both military alliances for a fivetosevenyear transition 
period culminating in the formation of a wholly new but yet 
undefined european security system 
during his visit to washington last week soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze dropped the previous soviet 
insistence that a united germany had to be entirely neutral 
asked if there was room for compromise in the us position 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said there was not 
she also said she did not know whether the soviet proposal 
represents an opening shot an opening negotiating position 
ms tutwiler and fitzwater declined to discuss a possible 
transitional period in germanys status saying only that a unified 
germany must stay in nato 
fitzwater raised the possibility of a nato summit meeting later 
this year to discuss germany and the alliances own changing role 
president bush and many of the western leaders have spoken 
about a larger political role for nato and one that is more 
involved in providing political economic and social stability in 
europe in these times of change the spokesman said 
concerning whether soviet troops should be allowed to stay in 
east germany and whether nato troops should be allowed in the east 
fitzwater said those are all issues that will have to be worked 
out with the alliance 
he said nato will determine its troop deployment position not 
the world war ii victors france britain the soviet union and 
united states that are working with east and west germany on the 
reunification plan 
shevardnadze first raised the possibility of german membership 
in both pacts simultaneously at a news conference at the state 
department last friday saying it was an idea he had heard 
mentioned 
but he had already used the idea as the centerpiece of a 
magazine article to be published next month 
many of our experts believe that the idea of dual 
membership for germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the 
difficulties emerging now shevardnadze wrote in his article for 
the may issue of natos sixteen nations an independent 
publication focusing on international security issues 
i would favor a serious and thorough analysis of this 
option he said

president bushs distaste for broccoli is 
getting nearly six times as much public attention as earth day 
according to a survey of peoples attentiveness to the news 
the times mirror center for the people and the press said 
wednesday that its interviewers asked 1212 people age 18 and older 
what vegetable it is that bush recently said he wouldnt eat 
seventysix percent said broccoli the right answer four 
percent named some other vegetable the rest refused to answer or 
said they didnt know 
by contrast 13 percent knew that april 22 is being observed as 
earth day to honor the environment fifteen percent gave a wrong 
answer and 72 percent said they didnt know when asked what was 
special about the date 
on another question the center reported that 74 percent of 
those responding said they approved of bushs overall performance 
sixteen percent disapproved 
sixtyfour percent said they were optimistic that the president 
would make progress in solving the countrys longterm problems 
in response to more specific questions 39 percent said bush was 
doing a good or excellent job in dealing with longterm economic 
problems the corresponding percentage was 20 percent on health 
care problems and 32 percent on education and the environment on 
all issues the largest group from 39 percent to 46 percent said 
he was doing only fair 
the survey also found for the fifth month in a row that 
americans paid more attention to foreign news than domestic news 
the organization listed 18 news stories and asked people which 
was the most important 
forty percent cited an international story with 21 percent 
naming lithuanian independence also mentioned were other political 
developments in the soviet union germany and elsewhere in eastern 
and central europe two percent named the release of black leader 
nelson mandela from a south african prison 
four percent mentioned domestic stories including oil spills 
the ncaa basketball playoffs the death of 87 people in a fire at a 
social club in new york and the attempt in idaho to pass a bill 
that would severely restrict abortions 
ten percent named stories not on the list 43 percent said they 
didnt know and 2 percent refused to answer this adds up to only 
99 percent because the percentages were rounded to the nearest full 
number 
the survey results are based on telephone interviews conducted 
under the direction of princeton survey research associates from 
april 58 with the 1212 respondents interviewed by the gallup 
organization the results are subject to a sampling error of plus

federal health officials criticized for 
slowness say they hope to soon begin sending 19000 physicians and 
hospitals detailed information about a new treatment for patients 
with spinal cord injuries 
officials announced march 30 that a study had found the steroid 
therapy effective but a consumer health group complained that 
nearly two weeks later many emergencyroom and traumacare 
physicians still did not know enough about the treatment to use it 
after receiving a letter from the public citizen health research 
group and requests from physicians public health officials decided 
wednesday to send a three to fourpage summary of the study 
findings to physicians and hospitals 
well get it out as quickly as possible said jim brown a 
spokesman for the public health service which includes the 
national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and 
stroke in bethesda md 
the study sponsored by the institute found that high doses of 
the steroid methylprednisolone given within eight hours of a spinal 
injury significantly reduces paralysis 
dr sidney wolfe director of the health group welcomed the 
institutes action but said its tragic that its taken so long 
several weeks have gone by since the research was accepted 
for publication in a medical journal when they arguably could have 
notified hospital emergency rooms he said its too late for 
these people 
about 10000 americans suffer spinal cord injuries each year 
and medical experts say 95 percent of those patients could benefit 
from the treatment because they are admitted to hospitals within 
eight hours 
wolfe noted that each day of delay means that 20 or 30 victims 
of spinal cord injuries might not receive this breakthrough 
treatment which he said could mean the difference for some between 
using crutches and a wheelchair 
wolfe said he had found that many physicians werent using the 
treatment because they hadnt yet seen data documenting its 
effectiveness 
michael b bracken a professor at the yale university school of 
medicine who directed the study was preparing a summary of the 
research findings that will be mailed to 6000 hospitals and 13000 
physicians said brown of the public health service 
institute officials had said they made the unusual move of 
announcing the research findings before their publication next 
month in the new england journal of medicine so that physicians 
could start using the treatment earlier 
news stories about the treatment included telephone numbers for 
physicians to call for more information however a tollfree 
number with a recorded message was available only the weekend after 
the announcement and another number at the institute was answered 
only during daytime working hours 
physicians who want more information before they receive the 
mailing may call the institute during daytime working hours at 
301 4965751 brown said officials were working on making a 
recorded message available on that number for night and weekend 
calls

the army is abandoning a longheld practice of 
shooting goats at a texas base to train doctors in treating 
military trauma but a medical group that sought the moratorium 
says the woundings are continuing at fort bragg nc 
the physicians committee for responsible medicine said 800 to 
1000 goats a year were being shot in the legs at fort sam houston 
in san antonio until the moratorium the practice however 
continues at fort bragg and as many as 1200 goats are involved 
the organization said 
dr neal d barnard a psychiatrist and president of the 
committee said he believes the army decided to use goats because 
no one would care about an animal with an unpopular face not a 
cute and cuddly face however the military was wrong 
barnard said the physicians group sought in moratorium in part 
after such army specialists as radiologists and psychiatrists who 
normally dont treat trauma victims were being told to participate 
in the training at fort sam houston 
i was very angry for a couple of reasons barnard said 
wednesday the first is that its not a very nice thing to be 
shooting these animals secondly its not even very good training 
if you really want to be good at treating wounds theres no 
substitute for going into a clinical setting an emergency room or 
an operating room and thats the way all competent trauma 
physicians are trained 
barnard said the wound of a goat is far different that a humans 
wound and that shooting a goat in the leg has no relation to an 
abdominal wound or a chest wound or a head wound the tissue 
feels different in the goat its got thick hairy skin 
barnard said the army had been shooting goats to train doctors 
since 1958 and that he learned of the ban late last week 
pat davis chief of public affairs for the armys academy of 
health sciences at fort sam houston said she could not confirm how 
long the woundings had been taking place the ban took effect about 
90 days ago 
ms davis said the army did not use firearms to inflict the 
wounds instead she said it used a firing mechanism to fire a 
projectile or metal pellet into a goats leg 
the military had been using the pellets to simulate the 
shocking impact of firing at a human from a military weapon 
the spokeswoman said military weapons fire projectiles at a far 
higher speed than a civilian handgun she said and the tissue 
damage is far worse 
the militarys weapons cause a great deal of destruction to 
the tissue she said and if military physicians do not clean the 
wound correctly the guy will lose his limb and probably his 
life 
but barnard said there has never been a single study showing 
that using goats for this type of training was effective 
they the military never bothered to look just spent money 
year after year shooting these goats he said 
barnard also said the armys decision was only temporary and 
that his organization would push for a permanent ban along with a 
ban at fort bragg 
theyre calling it temporary we are saying enough is enough 
civilian physicians dont train this way

mayor marion barry is seeking dismissal of 
drug and perjury charges against him while some barry advisers are 
portraying him as having been reluctant to use drugs on the night 
of his arrest 
the government manufactured the crime that produced barrys 
arrest in january the mayors attorney r kenneth mundy said in 
court papers seeking dismissal of a cocaine possession and perjury 
indictment 
top city officials on wednesday distributed a version of events 
that allegedly preceded barrys arrest in an fbi sting operation 
their chronology of events depicted barry as reluctant to use drugs 
and ignorant of how to smoke a crack cocaine pipe 
those assertions contrast with an account of the case provided 
by law enforcement sources who have said barry used hand signals 
rubbing his fingers together under his nose to indicate that he 
wanted to use cocaine 
the chronology was prepared in a draft of the court papers but 
was omitted from the document filed in court 
court papers filed by mundy on tuesday said a videotape that 
allegedly shows barry smoking crack cocaine should not be used in 
the mayors trial 
mundy also asked us district judge thomas penfield jackson to 
throw out grand jury testimony in which barry allegedly lied about 
his drug use mundy argued that barry had been assured he was not 
the target of a drug probe 
barry faces an eightcount cocaine possession and perjury 
indictment that was returned several weeks after his jan 18 
arrest the mayor was arrested after allegedly being videotaped 
smoking crack cocaine in the downtown washington hotel room of 
a female companion hazel rasheeda moore 
we will respond to all defense motions in court us 
attorney jay b stephens said in a statement he did not elaborate 
the chronology according to a barry aide who spoke on condition 
of anonymity was prepared by three people who have seen the fbi 
videotape including mundy 
according to the chronology moore received money from barry 
but the mayor gave no indication that any drugs were to be 
purchased for him or that he wanted to use any drugs 
when asked moments later by moore if he wanted to smoke crack 
cocaine barry clearly and unequivocally said no it said 
but when moore mentioned to barry that they could obtain some 
powder cocaine from a woman undercover agent who was posing as 
a friend of moores barry asked moore to summon the woman back to 
the room 
the draft said that after the agent left moore produced crack 
cocaine and handed the pipe to barry who asked words to the 
effect of how does the pipe work and handed it back to moore 
after further refusals barry lit the pipe inhaled twice put 
on his suit jacket and was arrested as he tried to leave the draft 
said 
in the court papers filed tuesday mundy argued that barry never 
intended to meet moore that evening and agreed to go to her room 
only after she declined to meet him in the hotel lobby or bar 
mundy also argued that barry expressed no desire to use drugs 
and agreed to do so only after moore produced them 
if convicted of a felony barry would be barred from office and 
prohibited from running for reelection

a census bureau projection that 13 percent of 
americans are not covered by health insurance is in line with 
numerous other estimates cited by proponents of governmentmandated 
universal health coverage 
the census bureau said wednesday that 265 percent of hispanic 
americans were not covered in 1988 by either public or private 
insurance compared to 202 percent for blacks and 117 percent for 
whites 
the age group least likely to have insurance protection was 16 
to 24 with 219 percent lacking coverage about 162 percent of 
those 25 to 34 were uninsured and 153 percent of people under 16 
lacked coverage 
in the 35 to 44 bracket 112 percent of people dont have 
insurance while the rates are 105 percent for those 45 to 54 and 
93 percent in the 55 to 64 group 
all but 03 percent of people over 65 are covered by medicare 
which is automatically available but does require participants to 
sign up for the government program 
in addition to calculating the number of people with insurance 
in 1988 the bureau asked about coverage over time it found that 
during a 28month period from 1985 to 1988 72 percent of people 
had continuous coverage and 28 percent lacked protection for at 
least one month during that time 
the study found that 631 percent of americans had insurance 
coverage through their jobs 144 percent were protected by other 
private coverage and 95 percent had government insurance 
medicare or medicaid the federalstate health program for the poor 
the new census figures are based on a surveys of three groups of 
households that were interviewed periodically in the bureaus 
survey of income and program participation 
the three groups included from 11500 to 13400 households with 
as many as 36500 people interviewed in the various groups the 
margin of error for a sample that size would be 1 percentage point 
or less

thousands of ships sail under flags of 
countries they never visit shipowners say that allows them to 
bring down costs but unions say the real bottom line is unsafe 
ships and poorly trained crews 
last weekends fire on the bahamasregistered scandinavian star 
which trapped hundreds of passengers on an allegedly unsafe ship 
has prompted a review in scandinavia of socalled 
flagofconvenience vessels 
the swedish seamens union says they are dangerous and is trying 
to get them banned from swedish ports shipowners say the bunting 
on the stern has nothing to do with the ships safety 
responding to the deadly fire a maritime commission from 
norway sweden and denmark decided to tighten inspection procedures 
for foreignflagged ships in scandinavian waters 
about 170 people were killed on the 20yearold ferry during the 
overnight trip from norway to denmark it was one of the worst 
passenger ship disasters on record 
passengers charged that the filipino and portuguese crewmen on 
the scandinavian star were poorlytrained to deal with the 
emergency and could not overcome their language barrier 
the ships norwegian captain hugo larsen stated at a maritime 
inquiry in copenhagen denmark on wednesday that the ship was safe 
and the crew adequate 
but the seamens union said that because the ship was registered 
in the bahamas it was not required to undergo the strict 
inspection procedures required for scandinavian vessels 
they said that shipowners often register their vessels in 
panama liberia and other countries to circumvent the stringent 
safety rules of their own countries and to take advantage of cheap 
labor 
filipino seamen work for as little as 150 an hour on nordic 
lines compared with about 10 an hour for a scandinavian 
its a bit like 19thcentury slave vessels said lennart 
johnson an official at the swedish seamens union the result is 
lowcost crews with poor education and low safety 
the swedish seamens union has a reputation for militancy and is 
lobbying with legislators to toughen swedish laws against vessels 
flying flags of convenience johnson said about 2000 merchant 
ships flying flags of convenience dock every year in swedish 
harbors 
others disagree with johnsons allegations 
some of the best operated ships in the world and some of the 
worst operated fly flags of convenience said david larner of 
lloyds of london the insurance company 
underwriters look first and foremost at the operators if hes 
good with a good track record then his premiums will reflect 
that larner said in a telephone interview 
but he also said that new operators with convenience 
registrations make us look more carefully before issuing 
policies 
tom bringsvaerd managing director of fred olsen line a 
norwegian ferry and cruise company dismissed claims that service 
or safety is affected by the hiring foreign seamen 
they get the same training and same qualifications as 
scandinavians said bringsvaerd 
he said norwegian shipowners were adopting flags of convenience 
to cut costs and remain competitive 
johnson dismissed the claim that local ferry companies were not 
competitive as nonsense 
he said that swedish ferry companies were immensely profitable 
bringsvaerd accused the swedish union of exploiting the 
scandinavian star disaster to push for tighter regulations that 
will benefit its own members 
they are misleading the public and using this tragic accident 
to promote their own subjective interests he said 
the portuguese trade unions representing crewmen on the 
scandinavian star also rejected the criticism we understand that 
the nordic unions are struggling to end foreign working aboard the 
ships but we dont understand that they could be so selfish to 
take advantage of a disaster the portugese union said in a 
statement issued in lisbon 
about 10000 vessels worldwide fly flags of convenience johnson 
said other experts said the figure varies but all agree that the 
practice is common

hundreds of thousands of americans seeking a 
profound religious experience will flock this year to elaborately 
mounted passion plays an art form that has been a source of 
centuries of suffering for jews 
the plays in places such as eureka springs ark and spearfish 
sd evoke controversy among christians and jews about whether 
they promote one of historys cruelest antisemitic stereotypes 
that jews bear a collective guilt for all time for jesus death 
the passion play portraying christs death and resurrection 
dates to the 13th century the famous passion play in the bavarian 
village of oberammergau began in the 17th century as collective 
devotion for surviving the bubonic plague 
in the postholocaust era many jewish and christian leaders are 
questioning the effect of passion plays that retain some of their 
medieval origins by portraying jewish antagonists of jesus as 
degenerate loathsome almost subhuman creatures according to 
an american jewish committee study 
i think we are in a transition period in terms of 
understanding the impact of the christian gospel on jews and 
judaism said the rev vincent a heier of st louis a roman 
catholic priest who is vice president of the national association 
of diocesan ecumenical officers 
one of the problematic areas is passion plays 
passion plays range from lavish professional productions to 
small churchorganized affairs at carnivals the institute for 
outdoor drama at the university of north carolina at chapel hill 
lists nine major us passion plays 
more than 200000 americans are expected to flock to the 1990 
oberammergau passion play which is held every ten years in the 
west german town officials at the great passion play in eureka 
springs expect 300000 people to see their annual production in its 
23rd season 
play organizers in oberammergau partly in response to concerns 
raised by american jewish leaders and some catholic scholars 
decided to make changes in this years production such as dropping 
the horns from jewish high priests and protraying judas as a 
confused rather than a coldly mercenary figure 
but those who have raised similar concerns report mixed success 
the national conference of catholic bishops has issued a 
really terrific set of guidelines for local parishes to be 
responsive to issues of antisemitism in passion plays according 
to rabbi a james rudin national interreligious affairs director 
of the american jewish committee 
one play that the committee said has shown vast improvement is 
the holy family passion play in union city nj 
others such as the nondenominational productions in arkansas 
and south dakota have been resistant to change according to some 
observers 
part of it is we are really out of touch both christians and 
jews with the sensitivities of the other said the rev john 
kelley who took part in discussions on the oberammergau production 
for the national secretariat of jewishcatholic relations of the 
us catholic conference 
he said a fairly common reaction among jews is that all passion 
plays should be banned while the first reaction of many christians 
is highly defensive saying there is nothing in the scripture that 
could be offensive to anyone 
the great passion play in eureka springs which runs april 27 to 
oct 27 this year is the largest and some say most problematic 
of the us productions 
marvin peterson executive vice president of the elna m smith 
foundation which manages the production said antisemitism was 
not at issue because the production sticks as close as possible to 
biblical accounts 
others say the production is historically inaccurate and jarring 
in what a 1984 american jewish committee study called its 
malevolence toward jews 
roslyn borg area director of the st louis chapter of the 
american jewish committee said the production isolates jesus and 
his followers from judaism costumes jesus in white and his jewish 
antagonists in black and portrays pontius pilate as a somewhat 
compassionate ruler who was easily influenced by the jews 
critics contend other popular passion plays such as the black 
hills passion play presented in south dakota and in lake wales 
fla are filled with distortions 
despite such concerns a resurgence in religious interest in the 
nation has increased the popularity of passion plays kelley said 
if anything the number of them seems to be growing he 
said as people have a sense of need of religious experience we 
are going to be using this art form more rather than less

hedstrom inc is renewing its call for 
customers to modify several models of the backyard gym sets to 
guard against potential injuries 
the pennsylvaniabased company says it wants to hear from about 
256000 owners of its backyard gym sets equipped with glide 
rides 
hedstrom said it would provide free guards for the gliders

children standing on the slide or crossbar of the gliders and 
reaching up to propel or stop the ride and have entrapped or 
pinched a finger in the bracket mechanism causing severed 
fingertips and severe cuts the company said

consumer response to a november 1988 repair program the consumer 
product safety commission said in an announcement reinstituting the 
original offer 
the repair program involves hedstrom and sears models of the 
gyms sold nationwide from 1982 to july 1 1988 approximately 
370000 sets were sold but only about 14000 consumers have 
requested the free glide guards said the cpsc 
affected models can be identified by reading the model label 
found on the top bar they include hedstrom models numbered 4277 
4377 4677 4778 4877 and sears brand models 72226 72066

the race between republican oilmanrancher 
clayton williams and toughtalking democrat ann richards could 
prove a crucial gauge of the strength of both parties in the 1990s 
state leaders say 
with the downanddirty democratic primary runoff over both 
nominees for governor pledged to stick to an issueoriented debate 
republicans already were casting the race as a struggle between 
conservatives and liberals democrats expect ms richards an 
outspoken abortion rights advocate to draw intense support from 
women 
williams 58 the oilmanrancher nicknamed claytie won the 
republican primary without a runoff last month in an 8 million 
campaign he says hell bring to government the same management 
style that made him a multimillionaire in business 
ms richards 56 who became an overnight celebrity after her 
noholdsbarred oratory at the 1988 democratic national convention 
had a bruising runoff tuesday against state attorney general jim 
mattox but retains her star status and brings voters an 
eightyear record of managing the state treasury 
there was little discussion of the issues before the runoff in 
which mattox alleged that ms richards a recovering alcoholic 
used illegal drugs including cocaine 10 years ago when she was a 
travis county commissioner 
shes somebody who can make state government work said ed 
martin executive director of the texas democratic party shes 
not the guy who has an 8 million mask and wants to take us back to 
the thrilling days of yesteryear 
but texas gop chairman fred meyer characterized the 
gubernatorial race as a clear choice between a national liberal 
democrat and a moderatetoconservative republican claytie 
williams thats exactly the kind of matchup we like in texas 
ms richards strongly supports abortion rights williams has 
said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest or danger 
to a mothers life 
the abortion issue also could figure prominently in the us 
senate race in which democratic nominee hugh parmer already is 
airing television commercials attacking incumbent republican sen 
phil gramm 
abortionrights advocate parmer has been sharply critical of 
legislation gramm introduced in congress to restrict abortions a 
former fort worth mayor and current state senator parmer won the 
nomination last month as did gramm 
gramm who overpowered democrat lloyd doggett in 1984 has said 
he is prepared to spend up to 20 million to hold onto his seat 
democratic national chairman ron brown said his party will pull 
together to hold power in the nations thirdlargest state 
ann richards is ready to lead modern texas into a new decade 
and a new century the texas of tomorrow can illafford the 
prehistoric notions of clayton williams brown said together 
we can make 1990 the stepping stone to a democratic white house in 
1992 
incumbent republican gov bill clements 72 is not seeking 
reelection

a jury convicted an inmate infected with 
aids of attempted murder for biting a sheriffs officer and 
yelling now die you pig 
the jury wednesday also convicted gregory d smith of four 
counts of aggravated assault and one count of making terroristic 
threats against the officer albert waddington 
smiths case is one of about 10 in the country in which a person 
with aids has been accused of attempting to spread the virus 
through biting or spitting smiths attorney said an appeal would 
rely on medical experts who say these are improbable methods of 
spreading the disease 
i believe the jury was impressed by the whole aids scenario 
hysteria defense attorney ralph kramer said 
the jury acquitted smith on one count each of aggravated assault 
and making terroristic threats in separate incidents involving two 
other officers 
sentencing is scheduled may 18 smith whos serving a fiveyear 
sentence for a robbery conviction faces a maximum sentence of 30 
years imprisonment he contracted aids in 1985 
waddington clapped his hands after the verdict was announced and 
left the courtroom without commenting 
smith shouted on your way home waddington stop in church 
and ask god to forgive you for that lie 
waddington said during the trial that smith bit him on the hand 
three times spat on him and said now die you pig die from what 
i have waddington 26 has not tested positive for the virus 
smith 26 has denied biting the guard his attorney said the 
scratches on the officers hands were caused by the jagged edges of 
smiths handcuffs 
the case is being closely watched by medical and legal experts 
who fear it will fuel misconceptions about how the disease is 
transmitted 
im highly critical of attempted murder charges in biting 
kinds of cases said larry gostin executive director of the 
american society of law and medicine and an associate professor at 
harvards school of public health what the criminal justice 
system is doing here is posing a very serious crime for a highly 
improbable result 
kramer said he would appeal the verdict on the contention that 
the judge improperly allowed testimony from the prosecutions 
medical expert who said there was a slight possibility aids could 
be transmitted through a bite 
i expect new jersey to take a stand on this issue and say no 
you cant charge a person with aids who bites with attempted 
murder kramer said 
an inmate was convicted in 1987 of assault with a deadly weapon 
his mouth and teeth for biting two prison guards in rochester 
minn the conviction was upheld by the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals in st louis 
harold kasselman the assistant camden county prosecutor who 
handled the case said smith was charged because he believed he 
could spread the disease by biting 
the fatal disease is generally transmitted through intravenous 
drug use blood transfusions and sexual contact 
authorities said the incident occurred june 11 as waddington and 
another guard john snow attempted to put smith into a patrol car 
to take him to the county jail after he was treated for a back 
injury at cooper medical center in camden

an aidsstricken man was prohibited from 
having sex in prison as part of his sentence for participating in a 
sex ring that preyed on boys 
joel dunaway was one of two men convicted of seconddegree 
sodomy wednesday they were the last of a group of six men 
convicted of hustling boys in the mobile area over a 10year period 
and taking them on trips where the boys had sex with them in 
exchange for drugs and liquor 
judge douglas johnstone sentenced dunaway 37 to one year in 
prison and ordered him to abstain from sexual intercourse 
if he has sex behind bars it would violate his probation and he 
could serve four additional years said assistant district attorney 
jo beth murphree she conceded however that the nosex sanction 
could be difficult to enforce 
johnstone also sentenced giles owen hamm jr 30 to two years 
in prison and five years probation four other men were convicted 
earlier of participation in the boysex ring 
dunaway arrested last april for having sex with a 13yearold 
boy reportedly contracted the aids virus in 1988 
attorneys familiar with the case said the boy and others said to 
have had sex with dunaway received aids tests in 1988 the results 
of those tests were sealed under alabamas juvenile laws 
fbi agent leslie berens said the victims ages 12 to 17 were 
picked up by the men and taken on trips the fbi became involved 
because some of the boys were taken across state lines to tennessee 
and new orleans 
they would drive around neighborhoods and look for kids on the 
street and often these were bored kids sometimes from troubled 
homes ms berens said

pervasive fraud played a major role in the 
collapse of many savings and loans fbi director william sessions 
said but running down the illegal deals is a timeconsuming and 
complex process 
experience demonstrates that insider abuse is a major factor 
in almost all of our investigations involving failed financial 
institutions sessions testified wednesday at a house banking 
committee hearing on savings and loan fraud 
a shortage of resources and the complexity of the fraud has 
hampered the agencys work he said 
it is often difficult to distinguish failures that involve 
fraud from failures resulting from poor management and poor 
business decisions sessions said 
last week the general accounting office estimated a 325 
billion to 500 billion federal bailout would be necessary over the 
next 30 years for failed savings and loans nationwide taxpayers 
would foot most of the bill 
in texas site of about a third of the cases the fbi is 
investigating frauds frequently involve the looting of 
institutions for the direct financial benefit of officers 
directors or major stockholders sessions said 
the banking committee chaired by rep henry b gonzalez is 
holding two days of hearings in dallas to examine investigations of 
fraud in the industry 
the committee has asked key figures at some of the most 
notorious failed thrifts to testify but only one thomas gaubert 
has indicated he will appear 
gaubert who has been acquitted once on fraud charges was 
chairman of independent american savings association the three 
others asked to testify were edwin t mcbirney former chairman at 
sunbelt savings association of texas don r dixon former owner of 
vernon savings and loan association and jarrett woods of western 
savings association 
all four institutions were recipients of multimilliondollar 
bailouts 
this is not a problem that is limited to texas or even to the 
southwest sessions said more incidents of insider abuse have 
been identified in texas however because the texas institutions 
are coming under closer scrutiny as they are being declared 
insolvent 
in north texas alone sessions said regulators have 38 
separate savings and loans institutions identified wherein major 
conspiratorial fraud is alleged over 500 subjects have been 
identified for investigation and possible prosecution 
gonzalez criticized the bush administration for being slow to 
implement regulations and safeguards adopted last year in bailout 
legislation 
we gave the regulatory and the law enforcement agencies 
unprecedented power to deal with the crisis and the cleanup 
gonzalez said but the administration left key jobs unfilled and 
failed to develop a sense of urgency 
the american people judging from my mail and my telephone 
calls are angry about what they see as business as usual 
approach to a disaster that is costing them dearly gonzalez said

bette davis fans packed an auction of the late 
stars possessions but many left emptyhanded as presale 
estimates were eclipsed by bids in the hundreds and even thousands 
of dollars 
a box lot of eyeglasses and false eyelashes that graced those 
famous bette davis eyes was valued at 25 to 50 but sold 
wednesday for 550 
a 16by20inch crayon drawing by costume designer edith head of 
a blackgowned miss davis in the movie all about eve was 
valued before sale at 1200 to 1800 it fetched 23100 
a leather script cover bearing the initials bd along with 
two scripts and a notepad brought 4400 the presale estimate 
was 50 to 100 
i thought i could get some of the small memorabilia but it 
started too high said honey schiller one of 1000 people who 
got into the auction at the william doyle galleries i love bette 
davis i think she was the best she was beautiful i could watch 
all about eve all night 
the entire sale of 261 lots had been expected to bring 60000 
to 103000 but the final tally was 22133650 according to 
lewis webre spokesman for the gallery 
webre attributed the high sale prices to good publicity a 
capacity crowd and an abiding interest in a star who embodies 
everything that embodied hollywood in the old days she is 
everyones kind of bitchy alterego 
potential bidders many attracted by some lots with an 
estimated worth of under 100 snaked 1 blocks out of the 
building before auction time 
it looked more like a hollywood premiere than an auction 
webre said 
miss davis who died in october at age 81 kept the furniture 
paintings photographs designer gowns glassware jewelry books 
and memorabilia in a sixroom townhouse in west hollywood 
a directors chair from family reunion embossed with miss 
davis name and the slogan she did it the hard way went for 
1320 
among those vying for the movie legends goods were other 
celebrities including actress cicely tyson who wore a babushka 
and sunglasses and was wedged in with the standees she remained 
incognito as she waved her paddle to cinch several purchases 
miss tyson paid 880 for a group of framed wall hangings one 
inscribed beauty is as beauty does and another no guts no 
glory she also bought a photograph of miss davis posed at the 
st james club on sunset boulevard for 3300 
miss tyson had no comment but her fellow auctiongoers werent 
shy 
my mother used the same diaper service as bette davis did 
boasted shelle ackerman a singer and actress who arrived 1 hours 
early for a frontrow seat 
its kind of scary to know she actually touched and lived with 
all of this said charles pierce of north hollywood calif an 
actor who has impersonated miss davis since 1954

the contras top military commander 
says he does not believe nicaraguas new government will be able to 
control the sandinista army and his troops will not lay down their 
weapons 
wednesdays statement was the most adamant by contra leader 
israel galeano since his subordinates signed an agreement with 
aides of presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro to disarm by 
her inauguration april 25 
un peacekeeping forces began arriving in honduras on monday to 
oversee the demobilization of the 12000 nicaraguan rebels most of 
whom were in border camps in this nation until recently 
but galeano said his troops will not hand over their guns to the 
peacekeepers 
mrs chamorro defeated the sandinistas in elections but i 
believe she will not be able to impose her authority on the 
sandinistas once she takes office galeano said 
he said his rebel army will honor its commitments and will 
abandon its camps in honduras on april 18 but the army of 
resistance will continue fighting in the mountains inside nicaragua 
until their is true democracy in our nation 
mrs chamorros conservative united national opposition uno 
defeated the 9yearold leftist sandinista government by a 
landslide in feb 25 elections 
there was no immediate comment by the sandinistas on galeanos 
statements but the nicaraguan government has said the refusal of 
the contras to disband could threaten the transition 
they say the contras must demobilize immediately and that the 
sandinista peoples army except for its top ranks should remain 
intact 
the sandinistas and uno have signed a transition protocol that 
would allow the sandinistas to retain control of the army while 
giving it at least a semblance of political neutrality 
under the accord mrs chamorro promises to respect the 
integrity and professionalism of the armed forces and all senior 
officers are barred from holding positions of leadership in 
political parties 
about 9000 armed contras have infiltrated back into nicaragua 
leaving behind 1000 wounded rebels and stragglers at their base 
camps at the honduran border town of yamales 
the contras and mrs chamorros representatives agreed monday to 
start dismantling the camps next wednesday under the supervision 
of un peacekeepers 
the contras in nicaragua were supposed to rally in safety 
zones to surrender their weapons and disband under a ceasefire 
but galeano said only the rebels who remain in honduras will 
surrender their weapons 
he criticized the peacekeepers for not finding funds to resettle 
contras and their relatives who were in honduran camps 
they have taken no action to provide humanitarian aid for our 
wounded and our relatives galeano said we will need about 
15 million monthly for that 
he said the united states which supported the contras in their 
nineyear war against the sandinistas should pay for resettling 
those who lay down their arms 
contra spokesman alejandro acevedo said he and six other members 
of a special rebel commission including three civilians would go 
to managua on monday to try to negotiate a truce 
acevedo said the commission will meet with roman catholic 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo and chamorro representatives but 
not with the sandinistas

former mayor frank rizzos radio talk show 
has been taped regularly by the philadelphia police department in 
an effort to monitor complaints by officers a newspaper reported 
today 
the philadelphia inquirer citing unidentified police sources 
said the tapes of frank talk with frank rizzo on wcauam were 
sent to senior police supervisors whenever the daily show contained 
comments critical of the citys police department or mayor w 
wilson goodes administration 
rizzo a former police chief was mayor from 1972 to 1980 he 
lost a close race to regain his city hall post from goode in 1987

his threehour show on the cbs ownedandoperated station to attack 
goode urge voters to register republican and launch a fifth bid 
for mayor in 1991 
the newspapers sources said police supervisory officials were 
told to keep track of critical comments so the department could 
match them with voice prints of officers 
the department keeps voice prints of uniformed officers to 
identify those who might misuse police radios police officials 
said 
police commissioner willie l williams and city managing 
director david h pingree acknowledged the tapes had been made but 
williams said they were not being used to identify officers 
any officer found to have used the tapes to identify officers

rizzos show

williams top commanders also unidentified routinely ask for 
copies of the rizzo tapes 
department officials said no officer had been reprimanded or 
questioned about calling in to the show the newspaper said 
it just shows you where their priorities are richard b 
costello president of the fraternal order of police lodge 5 told 
the newspaper right now your chances of getting shot in 
philadelphia are about as good as they are in beirut but the 
department is using people to track down phone callers 
rizzo said he knew his show had been taped 
a guy from the mayors office told me rizzo told the 
newspaper i get most of my leads right from the mayors office 
its an outrage this is a reign of terror an absolute reign of

president yang shangkun will visit five latin 
american countries in midmay the latest in a series of trips by 
chinese leaders to court better relations with the third world 
the foreign ministry said today that the 82yearold yang will 
make official visits to mexico brazil uruguay argentina and 
chile 
highlevel official contacts with the west have virtually 
stopped since chinas military crackdown on the prodemocracy

the diplomatic gap by stressing its third world ties 
yang visited egypt and three other middle east countries in 
december and premier li peng traveled to nepal pakistan and 
bangladesh in november 
foreign minister qian qichen has traveled extensively through 
africa the middle east and india 
the post of president is largely ceremonial but yang a former 
general in the peoples liberation army is one of chinas most 
powerful political figures because of his strong military links 
foreign chinawatchers say yang is a top candidate to succeed 
85yearold deng xiaoping as chinas paramount leader

at least one trader at the chicago mercantile 
exchange wasnt enthusiastic about the mandatory ethics course that 
professors at a downtown law school will teach the mercs 2500 
members 
to get some lawyers to try to tell us whats ethical and what 
isnt ethical is kind of funny said the livestock trader who 
spoke on condition of anonymity i dont think im going to come 
out of there doing anything different than when i went in 
members began signing up wednesday for the mandatory twohour 
class part of a reform effort implemented after fbi moles 
infiltrated the merc and the chicago board of trade in a probe of 
suspected fraud fortyeight people mostly traders were indicted 
last summer 
we believe you will find the session both interesting and 
stimulating and trust you will leave the session with much to 
think about merc officials said in a letter to members last week 
the board of trade already has started a mandatory ethics 
session for all new members said spokesman michael oconnell 
he said bot officials also are working with the center for 
ethics and corporate policy in chicago to create an course that 
could include other members as well 
james oliff second vice president of the mercs board of 
governors said anyone who trades at the merc must take the new 
course he said they will first be given a definition of what 
ethics is all about 
basically we want to impress upon our members that in 
addition to looking at rules that there are other actions that 
should govern their conduct and thats ethical behavior he said 
they are guardians of the exchange as a financial institution as 
well as guardians of themselves 
merc members will be told the consequences of violating rules 
and will be shown hypothetical situations involving questionable 
trading practices oliff said 
the class is being offered free after trading hours and will 
be taught by faculty at chicagokent college of law

a man charged in an illegal nightspot fire that 
killed 87 people pleaded innocent today to 174 counts of murder and 
other charges 
julio gonzalez 36 was guarded by four armed court officers as 
he was arraigned before judge burton r roberts in triallevel 
state supreme court 
gonzalez who spoke to the court through a spanish translator 
mumbled no culpable when asked how he pleaded on the charges 
the judge told attorneys that under state law gonzalez could 
serve only a single 25 yearstolife sentence even if convicted on 
all charges the law stipulates his sentences would have to run 
concurrently roberts said 
gonzalez is accused of setting a fire that trapped revelers 
inside the tiny happy land social club in the bronx 
authorities charge that the cuban immigrant enraged by the 
rejection of a former girlfriend who worked at the club bought 1 
worth of gasoline spilled it in the illegal clubs doorway and set 
it aflame only five people escaped the cramped club following the 
4 am fire including the girlfriend 
courtappointed defense attorney richard w berne said today he 
had not decided whether to use an insanity defense for his client 
although he had indicated earlier that was a possibility 
berne said he plans to ask for a dismissal of all charges 
against gonzalez because the lawyer was not given access to a 
videotaped confession by his client when the case was submitted to 
the grand jury 
gonzalez was indicted march 30 on 174 counts of murder two 
counts of arson and single counts of attempted murder and assault 
he was charged with two separate murder counts for each of the 
victims killed in the social club blaze 
the club lacked proper permits and did not have adequate exits 
and sprinkling systems

irish prime minister charles 
haughey brought a message of economic unity to northern ireland on 
wednesday but protestant demonstrators shouted support for the 
islands political division 
haughey haughey out out out demonstrators cried 
haughey chairman of the european communitys council of 
ministers told a conference on crossborder trade that economic 
forces will inevitably interlink the economies of both parts of 
ireland 
as the technical and fiscal borders disappear and both 
economies will converge it will make simple common sense for us to 
combine in facing the problems and opportunities that the situation 
will present equally to us both haughey said these are the 
economic realities of the future 
the overwhelmingly roman catholic republic of ireland has been 
separated from protestantdominated northern ireland since 1922 
when ireland gained independence from britain irelands 
constitution lays claim to the whole island and northern ireland 
has been torn by conflict between advocates of irish unity and 
those loyal to britain 
reg empey the lord mayor of belfast and a protestant spoke to 
the conference before haughey and denounced irelands claim on the 
province 
about 300 protestants gathered outside the europa hotel before 
haugheys speech they were kept under control by a large security 
operation mounted by the royal ulster constabulary northern 
irelands police force 
haughey is here to dance on the graves of the provinces 
bereaved the rev ian paisley told reporters outside the hotel 
paisley leader of the democratic unionist party referred to 
the slaying of four members of the ulster defense regiment they 
were killed monday by an irish republican army bomb irelands 
foreign minister gerry collins earlier this year had called for 
the heavily protestant unit to be disbanded 
haughey repeatedly stressed the two parts of ireland should 
cooperate within the 12nation european community haughey 
currently speaks on behalf of the bloc its presidency rotates 
every six months 
our economic and social characteristics which are shared by 
both parts of ireland would benefit if a combined approach could 
be established haughey told the conference which was organized 
by the institute of directors 
we have a clear mutual interest in strengthening community 
policies for the less developed regions it makes sense for both 
parts of the island to cooperate and share the costs in developing 
strategy 
earlier as he was ushered quickly past the demonstrators into 
the hotel haughey was asked whether he worried about his personal 
security while in belfast 
not particularly he said i know the ruc royal ulster 
constabulary will make every effort to look after me 
a frontpage cartoon in the irish times of dublin on wednesday 
taunted haughey for his past criticism of british rule in northern 
ireland the cartoon showed haughey surrounded by ruc men with the 
prime minister saying still a police state thank goodness 
irish leaders have rarely visited northern ireland since 
sectarian and political fighting flared in 1969 
haugheys predecessor garret fitzgerald was in the province in 
november 1985 to sign the angloirish agreement with mrs thatcher 
the accord deeply disliked by protestants gives dublin a formal 
consultative role in northern irelands affairs and pledges the two 
governments to cooperate against terrorism

japan is leading the united states in 
areas of productivity education and trade but not surprisingly 
it lags behind in one category leisure time 
american men spend on average 205 hours a week at leisure 
compared with 133 hours taken by japanese men according to a 
university of michigan study the disparity is even greater between 
american women who take 218 hours of time out each week and 
japanese women who take just 106 hours 
economics professors frank p stafford and f thomas juster said 
they studied time spent on active leisure or sports and 
hobbies and social interaction in the united states japan and 
six other countries 
using statistics from surveys of 1000 or more adults conducted 
between 1964 and 1987 in the united states japan the soviet 
union finland hungary norway denmark and sweden they found a 
gradual decline in the number of hours men spend at work in all 
eight countries 
among the other findings 
the workweek ranged from 54 hours in the soviet union to 334 
hours in denmark japanese men worked 52 hours a week hungarian 
men 508 hours and american men 44 hours 
the amount of time that men spend on housework ranged from 181 
hours a week in sweden to 35 in japan american men spent 138 
hours soviet men 119 hours and norwegian men 168 hours a week on 
housework 
women in the soviet union spent more time working than women in 
the other countries averaging 393 hours a week on the job and 27 
hours a week doing housework american women averaged 239 hours a 
week on the job and 305 hours a week working at home danish women 
worked 208 hours a week on the job and 231 hours a week at home 
the researchers said hungarians and soviets work so many hours 
because they earn relatively low wages not enough to buy added 
leisure time 
neither japan nor the united sates approaches the 543 hours a 
week spent on leisure activities by men in denmark or the 537 
hours spent by danish women according to staffords study

engineers will need a day or two before considering 
the startup of an oilfired unit at the turkey point power plant 
complex after a hydrogen gas explosion and fire shut the unit 
utility officials said 
no one was injured and two nuclear plants and another oilfired 
plant at turkey point were not affected by wednesdays gas leak 
spokesmen said 
the fire was confined to an elevated enclosure housing an 
exciter a small auxiliary generator that provides the initial 
source of electricity to power the generator 
plant operators took the unit off line when they detected a loss 
of hydrogen pressure and the fire was discovered in the exciter 
about 15 minutes later the florida power amp light co said 
the visible damage is very very moderate said spokesman 
dale thomas we can see a little bit of twisted metal around the 
housing that contains the generating equipment and theres a 
little bit of black soot around the bearings 
the plants fire brigade had to put out the fire twice because 
the flammable hydrogen continued leaking and exploded a second 
time he said 
the hydrogen leaked from the sealed room where the gas cools the 
spinning turbine generator passed through a turbine shaft and into 
the exciter enclosure a shedsized building on a deck two stories 
high the utility said 
utility workers will have to remove the generator housing on 
unit 2 to assess damage and repair costs which could take a day or 
two thomas said 
engineers would have to make sure the turbine generator which 
spins at 3600 revolutions per minute remained in alignment and 
its mounts and shafts were not damaged by the force of the 
explosion said gary mehalik another utility spokesman 
unit 2 was the only one operating at turkey point at the time of 
the fire which left the 2090megawatt plant idle indefinitely 
the loss of turkey points generating capacity was not 
considered crucial because florida power amp light could boost the 
power generated at other plants or turn on idle units elsewhere in 
its system 
the miamibased utility is the states largest serving 3 
million customers from key west almost to jacksonville

gen michel aouns gunners battled rival 
forces under militia chieftain samir geagea with howitzers and 
mortars today in the fight for control of the christian enclave 
police said four people were killed and seven wounded in the 
exchanges across east beirut and kesrouan province north of the 
capital 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across the city as the two 
sides hammered each others residential districts with 130mm 
howitzers 
the escalation which began about 3 am kept civilians in 
underground shelters and brought life to a standstill 
by police count the struggle for the 310squaremile christian 
enclave has killed 873 and wounded 2365 since it broke out jan 30 
the showdown the worst intrachristian confrontation of the 
nations 15yearold civil war has caused material damage 
estimated at 1 billion 
according to police figures 400000 of the enclaves 1 million 
people have fled to safer areas in lebanon and neighboring 
countries 
palls of smoke billowed from the mountain resort of kleiat a no 
mans land separating aouns troops and geageas fighters in upper 
kesrouan phosphorous shells rained on its already wrecked 
restaurants and villas a police spokesman said 
poor villagers who had remained in kleiat despite the savage 
shelling duels deserted their town early this week to caves they 
dug in nearby mountains said the police spokesman who cannot be 
named in line with regulations 
interior minister elias khazen visited jounieh provincial 
capital of the kesrouan province on wednesday and said the 
government of syrianbacked president elias hrawi planned to spread 
its authority to the christian enclave 
khazen who has been based in moslem west beirut since the 
government was formed nov 24 said he will operate from jouniehs 
city hall for two days weekly to underscore hrawis determination 
to govern the enclave 
his visit to the province came after repeated calls by geagea 
for hrawis government to assume control over the army barracks and 
government facilities in his areas of influence 
aoun has rejected the arab league peace agreement under which 
hrawi was elected and does not recognize the president 
khazen sailed to jounieh by boat from beirut to avoid 
checkpoints erected by aouns troops along part of the coastal 
highway that connects the capital with the port which is under 
geageas control 
he also visited maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir at 
bkirki his mountain seat above jounieh and declared that 
lebanon will be united again 
khazen his eyes brimming with tears said the extraordinary 
conditions that had prevented us from living in the eastern areas 
christian enclave will be over soon now we are in kesrouan 
kesrouan province is geageas main power base and the reserve 
for his militia which fields 6000 hardcore fighters and about 
30000 reservists aoun has 19000 army troops

chinas foreign ministry today refused to answer 
questions about reported violent ethnic uprisings in extreme 
western china and a ban on travel by foreign tourists and 
journalists to the area 
unconfirmed reports say dozens of people have been killed 
at a weekly briefing spokeswoman li jinhua evaded repeated 
questions on reported moslem unrest in xinjiang uygur autonomous 
region saying the foreign ministry was not responsible for 
internal affairs and i am not clear about the situation 
government officials in xinjiang and beijing have neither 
confirmed nor denied reports that troops were sent in friday to 
quell rioting by moslem ethnic groups in three cities near 
xinjiangs borders with the soviet union and pakistan 
few details were known of the unrest reported by western and 
asian diplomats in beijing foreign travelers in xinjiang say the 
disturbances occurred in the taklimakan desert cities of kashgar 
hotan and kuqa 
one asian diplomat said the rioting in kashgar was sparked by a 
dispute over the construction of a mosque and involved kirghiz

nearly 133 years after the ss central 
america sank in a hurricane assorted predators are churning up a 
storm over the shipwrecks 1 billion cargo of gold ingots coins 
and passengers fortunes 
a lawsuit to establish whether the treasure had ever been 
abandoned originally pitted the columbusamerica discovery group a 
group of 100 investors who used space age technology to find the 
wreck and 45 insurance companies who claim rights to the treasure 
but the intervention of columbia university and two businessmen 
who contend their data were used to pinpoint the wreck has turned 
the trial into a multisided squabble over fine points of law 
the sixth day of testimony ended wednesday and arguments in the 
case are expected to end this week 
the treasure hunters have invested 10 million and 13 years in 
raising to the surface more than a ton of gold ingots and coins 
buried 1 miles under the sea 160 miles off the south carolina 
coast they say 2 tons remain on the ocean floor 
the ship ran into a hurricane and sank on sept 12 1857 as it 
sailed to new york from california between 362 and 423 of the 578 
people on board are said to have perished 
among the cargo were 3 tons of gold bars and freshly minted 
double eagle gold coins from the san francisco mint worth 16 
million at the time and about 450 million at todays prices many 
passengers were carrying fortunes and columbusamerica officials 
believe the total treasure could be worth up to 1 billion 
the insurance companies argue that they never gave up their 
claims and are asking for the return of the insured gold 
however not all of the gold was insured and business records 
describing the insured cargo and proof that the claims were paid no 
longer exist 
lawyers for columbia said a sonar survey by dr william ryan an 
oceanographer at columbia was done for two businessmen in search 
of the wreck in 1984 richardson said harry john and jack grimm a 
texas oilman paid for ryans research 
the lawyers said ryan later exchanged the data with thomas g 
thompson a president of columbusamerica and that thompson used 
the data to locate the wreck site 
the university claims columbusamerica then misled the public by 
saying the wreck was discovered when it hadnt been 
attorneys for columbusamerica denied the information from ryan 
was of any use 
the treasure hunt has been further complicated by revelations 
about john the heir to the miller brewing co fortune 
john used derance inc a catholic charity he had set up in 
1946 to establish santa fe communications which he used to spend 
millions looking for lost treasures santa fe paid columbia 
university more than 300000 for a sonar survey of a portion of 
the ocean floor looking for the central america 
john testified that in 1984 the board of directors of derance 
decided to stop all treasure hunts and he signed over the rights 
to the columbia research to the province of st joseph of the 
capuchin order in detroit at the time the internal revenue 
service was questioning santa fes taxexempt status 
john testified that he bought back the rights from the order for 
10 two weeks before the trial 
on tuesday night the order renegotiated the agreement which 
now will give it onethird of any proceeds john recovers through 
the court

finished kollek said on israel radio to expect now that there 
will be good relations this wont happen

killed in clashes between rival black factions including five 
people who were shot to death when assailants riddled a bus with 
bullets police said today

the white opposition group was stirring racist fears to try to 
wreck peace talks

blazing tire around her neck in a ritual necklace killing near 
port shepstone police said few details were provided on the other

africa during the coming decade as the country goes through major 
changes

negotiate an end to whiteminority rule he said the conservative 
party was waging a campaign to discredit the anc by stirring up 
white fears

control and he is therefore seeking to sabotage a settlement 
between the anc and np the ruling national party and is trying to 
corrode all potential support mandela told journalists after

conservative party were a threat to hopes of negotiating a peaceful 
settlement in south africa the party contends that whites and 
blacks cannot live together and is calling for a white homeland

fw de klerk to try to clear the way for fullscale negotiations

exiled king michael of romania was 
forced today to cancel his first visit to his native country in 43 
years after the bucharest government canceled his visa 
the official romanian news agency rompres said officials 
rescinded the visa today after the exmonarch rejected the 
governments appeal that he postpone his trip until after elections 
set for may 20 
while there was no official explanation for the visa 
cancellation the provisional government said the visit could cause 
violence in romania which is still recovering from the overthrow 
of hardline communists in december 
the governing national unity front led by interim president ion 
iliescu also was reportedly concerned that the former kings visit 
might give a boost to rival parties in the election campaign 
a spokesman for the bucharest government reading a statement 
said the government has nothing against a private visit of the 
exking in romania it cannot agree however to a visit with a 
very political character 
it was to be a strictly private visit former king michael 
68 told a news conference at the zurich airport where he was 
barred from boarding a swissair flight to the romanian capital of 
bucharest 
i dont understand the decision to rescind the visas i dont 
know what concerns there could have been he said 
rompres said authorities had conveyed a message to the former 
king asking him to postpone the trip and had also issued 
instructions to border guards to prevent him from entering the 
country 
the news agency said the romanian embassy in berne switzerland 
also told swissair officials the airline would be breaking 
international regulations if it allowed a passenger without a 
visa to board the flight to bucharest 
despite the romanian governments action the former king flew 
from geneva to zurich where he had planned to catch a scheduled 
direct swissair flight at noon to bucharest but the airlines 
management decided after a hastily called meeting that the 
exmonarch would not be allowed to board the plane 
at his news conference the exmonarch held up his british 
passport to show that it had been stamped with a romanian visa 
despite the bucharest governments decision michael said he was 
still planning a visit as soon as possible 
the airport news conference marked the first time that former 
king michael himself has commented on the visit normally all 
contacts with the press are handled by his daughter princess 
margarita or by a swiss spokeswoman 
he was to have been accompanied on the visit by his wife queen 
anne and his daughters margarita and anne who also all had their 
visas canceled they learned of the romanian decision only after 
leaving their home in versoix near geneva switzerland to catch 
the flight to zurich 
another daughter helen 39 arrived in bucharest on tuesday 
with a convoy from britain containing 120 tons of relief supplies 
the princess said she was struck by the dilapidation and 
poverty she had seen in several cities 
the former king has not set foot on romanian soil since he was 
forced to abdicate and leave the country by the communists on dec 
30 1947 
michael said he had intended to stay no longer than 10 days in 
romania princess margarita said in geneva that the deposed monarch 
viewed his trip as a spiritual pilgrimage and was not concerned 
with possible violence 
on wednesday the bucharest provisional government which came 
to power in december after communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was 
ousted in a bloody revolution issued a statement warning of the 
possibility of some violent manifestations if the exmonarchs 
visit took place as scheduled 
the visit and the publicity surrounding it are interpreted as 
a political gesture of a nature to bring about unwelcome elements 
in the electoral campaign and stir new passions the government 
statement said 
it said michaels visit before the elections would be of a 
nature exacerbating existing conflicts while also endangering his 
personal security

that is incredible said chavira i just cant imagine how 
he can direct the guilt at parents i dont know of a single 
hispanic not concerned about education 
for him to ignore the facts that hispanics have the 
leastsalaried people in our schools the poorest of real wealth to 
be taxed for him to discard those factors and lay it on the 
parents im getting very emotional here he is absolutely 
incorrect 
cavazos comments came after he opened a hearing on hispanic 
education the first of five regional meetings on the subject 
about 40 percent of hispanics nationwide left school before high 
school graduation during the 1980s cavazos said the rate for all 
groups in the united states is 30 percent 
he said only 11 percent of hispanics complete four or more years 
of college by the time they are in their early 30s 
but cavazos didnt intend to imply that hispanic parents dont 
value education said etta fielek director of public affairs for 
the department of education cavazos meant to say that the hispanic 
population lacked leadership not values ms fielek said 
jose cardenas executive director of the intercultural 
development research association disagreed 
there is a lot of leadership in the hispanic community said 
cardenas hispanic leaders have not been able to become involved in 
the decisionmaking process because they have repeatedly been 
stymied he said 
the hearing and others to follow in miami chicago los angeles 
and boston were organized by a federal task force to address what 
president bush has called the crisis in hispanic education

east germanys new parliament today named 
lothar de maiziere as prime minister backed a plan for swift 
unification with west germany and apologized to jews for the 
atrocities of the nazis 
the nations first freely elected government also said a unified 
germany should at least temporarily be a part of the nato alliance 
a key issue when the superpowers begin unification talks in the 
coming weeks and it endorsed a merger of the two german currencies 
by july 1 a demand of west germany 
the agreement among east germanys major political parties on 
the speed of reunification a united germanys military alignment 
and a timetable for a currency union was a huge leap forward to 
creating a single germany 
the sweeping moves will be followed by unification talks with 
west germany and the four world war ii allies that divided the 
countries the soviet union united states britain and france 
in a remarkable string of conciliatory gestures parliament 
recognized the legitimacy of polands postwar borders and 
apologized for east germanys role in the sovietled invasion that 
crushed reforms in czechoslovakia in 1968 
it also said east germany is prepared to make reparations to 
nazi victims and urged establishment of diplomatic relations with 
israel 
the hardline communist government that was toppled in october 
had never formally apologized for the holocaust west germany has 
apologized for nazi atrocities and has paid reparations to jews 
parliament approved a declaration saying that east germany 
admits in the name of the citizens of this country its 
coresponsibility for the humiliation and expulsion and murder of 
jewish women men and children 
jews in all the world and the people of israel are asked to 
forgive us for the wrongs they experienced persecuted jews should 
be granted asylum in the future in east germany 
an israeli foreign ministry official michael shilo said the 
declaration paves the way for further dialogue on establishing 
diplomatic relations between the two countries 
its a very positive text it may be overdue but it is 
nonetheless welcome said shilo who headed an israeli delegation 
that earlier this year held two rounds of preliminary talks with 
east germanys communistled transition government on setting up 
diplomatic ties 
shilo said the declaration appeared to meet israels two 
conditions for establishing ties east germanys acceptance of 
moral responsibility for the holocaust and its willingness to 
negotiate reparations 
parliament chose de maiziere leader of the conservative 
christian democrats and installed his 24member cabinet on a vote 
of 265108 with nine abstentions eighteen members of the 
400member parliament were absent 
the prime minister was strongly backed by chancellor helmut kohl 
of west germany his conservative alliance won 48 percent of the 
vote in march 18 elections that gave de maiziere a mandate to 
negotiate with west germany 
the coalition agreement on the makeup of his government was 
reached wednesday after nearly a week of intense negotiations 
cleared the way for parliamentary approval 
the cabinet pledged to secure prosperity social justice and 
freedom for all east german citizens according to excerpts carried 
by the east german news agency adn 
the agreement also paved the way for rapid reunification by 
stating the merging of the two countries should be based on the 
article of the west german constitution that permits direct 
incorporation of east german territory into west germany 
it calls for a direct 11 conversion of east german marks for 
west german marks when the nations merge their currencies west 
germanys central bank has proposed a 21 rate for all but only 
small savings accounts 
the coalition agreement also lays the foundation for east 
germanys foreign policy and says it can be assumed that a 
unified germany during a transition period and until the creation 
of a collective european security system should be a member of a 
nato that itself is transforming its military functions 
the statement endorses western demands that a united germany be 
part of nato the soviet union wants a new germany to be neutral 
but this week proposed that it have joint membership in nato and 
the warsaw pact west germany now is in nato and east germany is 
part of the warsaw pact 
an increasingly restive workforce worried about rampant 
unemployment associated with reunification planned demonstrations 
today 
about 20 tractors and farms trucks some bearing signs saying 
market economy for farmers rolled into the parking lot of 
parliament to demonstrate their concern over loss of state 
subsidies and fear the governmentowned land they till will fall 
into private hands 
but telephone and other electronics workers fearing unemployment 
did not follow through with their appeal for a threehour strike in 
the capital 
approval of the de maiziere government clears the way for the 
start of talks with west germany on merging their divergent 
economic and political systems after four decades of separation 
a west german government spokesman said wednesday that kohl 
wants to sign a treaty on monetary union between the two states by 
may 6 with the currency merger to go into effect by july 7

seven demonstrators were arrested for 
violating a court order that restricts protests over the firing of 
selmas first black school superintendent 
the arrests wednesday occurred one day after lauderdale county 
circuit judge leslie johnson issued an order restricting 
demonstrators to the sidewalk in front of city hall it also 
prohibits them from encouraging car horn honking marching around 
the building or holding picnics in the lobby 
four protesters were arrested outside city hall and three others 
were arrested wednesday afternoon after a scuffle outside a 
restaurant involving three policemen 
the protests have been continuing since middecember when the 
whitecontrolled school board refused to extend the contract of 
superintendent norward roussell roussell has filed a racial 
discrimination lawsuit against the white school board members who 
voted not to extend his contract which expires in june 
police chief melvin summerlin said the first arrests occurred 
after a group of protesters set up chairs on the sidewalk in front 
of city hall blocking a loading zone in violation of the order 
and refused to move summerlin said he ordered the group to 
disperse but he was ignored 
the incident at the restaurant apparently was sparked when a 
driver was cited for blowing his horn about a block away from city 
hall 
attorney rose sanders said the people arrested had been abiding 
by the court order 
those people were exercising their constitutional rights and 
the actions by the city against them were immoral and unjust she 
said 
several motorists were given tickets for blowing their car horns 
as they drove by city hall mayor joe smitherman said officials 
believe the motorists were deliberately testing the court order

bond awaiting trial in washington dc 
jose dionisio suarez y esquivel 51 arrested at his st 
petersburg home early wednesday waived his rights to a bond 
hearing before a federal magistrate here on charges of conspiracy 
to murder a foreign official 
suarez is accused of providing the explosives and detonating 
devices in the explosion that killed former chilean ambassador 
orlando letelier and business colleague ronni moffitt as they drove 
to work in washington on sept 21 1976 
us officials said they expect the new chilean government to 
prosecute top intelligence officials of the former military 
government of gen augusto pinochet on charges of planning 
leteliers assassination the new york times reported today the 
killings long have been a sore point in relations between the 
united states and chile 
in washington sen edward m kennedy dmass welcomed the 
arrest and commended the fbi but said unfortunately the 
masterminds of this atrocity remain at large in chile i hope and 
expect that the new democratic government in that nation will do 
all in its power to bring them to justice 
a former chilean diplomat jose miguel barros testified in a 
chilean court last year that leteliers assassination was ordered 
by chilean army gen juan manuel contreras sepulveda who headed 
the chilean national intelligence agency 
pinochet stepped down as president last month after the election 
of a civilian patricio aylwin 
us marhals said suarez would be flown to washington as early

life in st petersburg rarely even leaving the house 
to our knowledge he hasnt been employed in the last 12 to 14 
years said assistant us attorney terry furr 
but his 30yearold wife elizabeth said suarez worked at home as 
an artist and never realized his face had been plastered in post 
offices and courthouses around the country for more than a decade 
no one ever notified him he was a fugitive said mrs 
suarez a hospital administration employee and mother of a 
15monthold boy she said they have lived either in tampa or st 
petersburg throughout their nineyear marriage 
letelier served as chilean ambassador to the united states in 
19711973 during the presidency of salvador allende who was 
ousted by pinochet in a coup letelier had begun to emerge as a 
leading international critic of pinochet when he and moffitt were 
assassinated

the chilean intelligence agency was arrested in april 1978 
townley was extradited to the united states confessed to planting 
the bomb on the order of superiors and spent 40 months in prison 
according to the fbi townley suarez and fugitive virgilio 
pablo paz built the bomb used in the assassination suarez 
allegedly provided the explosives and detonators and purchased the 
bomb parts 
a federal grand jury also indicted three chilean army personnel 
in connection with the case

a jury thursday convicted a mildmannered 
former accountant and sunday school teacher of the premeditated 
murder of his wife mother and three children in their suburban 
mansion 18 years ago 
a gaunt whitehaired john e list 64 showed no emotion as the 
verdict was announced after the jury deliberated almost nine hours 
over two days 
his sentencing is scheduled for may 1 
defense attorney elijah l miller jr acknowledged in opening 
arguments that list committed the killings on nov 9 1971 miller 
sought a verdict of seconddegree murder based on a contention that 
list had a mental disease or defect 
the jury found list guilty of five counts of firstdegree 
murder an offense that carries a life term with no parole until 
after 15 years seconddegree murder would have allowed parole 
after a third of the 30year maximum sentence 
list was arrested in richmond va in june after a telephoned 
tip to the americas most wanted television show which had 
broadcast his case 
his arrest ended a secret life as a fugitive spent mostly in 
denver in which list again took up his profession returned to the 
lutheran church and remarried 
authorities found the bodies of his wife helen 45 mother alma 
84 daughter patricia 16 and sons john 15 and frederick 13 in 
their 18room westfield mansion on dec 7 1971 
dirgelike religious music was playing over an intercom system 
the heat had been lowered to 50 degrees and list left a series of 
chillingly matteroffact notes explaining his actions and 
apologizing 
two pictures of list emerged during the trial 
witnesses testified he was a mildmannered deeply pious and 
strictly raised lutheran born in a hardworking german immigrant 
community in bay city mich he was a history buff deeply involved 
in his church who loved to play war games 
but other evidence clouded the image of the straitlaced father 
and ordinary suburban family 
list told his psychiatrist he watched erotic films to become 
sexually aroused witnesses told investigators shortly after the 
bodies were discovered that patricia was interested in witchcraft 
list said he feared she would start smoking marijuana 
his sisterinlaws husband gene syfert testified that list 
was fascinated with unsolved mysteries 
and lists wife was dying turned psychotic and bedridden by 
latestage syphilis caught from her first husband in 1943 
defense psychiatric experts testified that an 
obsessivecompulsive personality disorder combined with lists 
twisted sense of religion and a series of a pressures on his life 
made him unable to deliberate over his decision 
list felt unable to support his family and dreaded the prospect 
of welfare he was oppressed by his wifes illness and the shame it 
caused his daughters acting ambitions concerned him and he 
feared his family was falling away from their religion and facing 
damnation the defense contended 
eleanor j clark a union county assistant prosecutor called 
list a hideous angel of death who carefully planned the 
killings and deliberated his options right until the end 
the state presented 41 witnesses in 2 days most of them 
investigators forensic experts and neighbors and acquaintances 
their testimony was intended to show that list meticulously planned 
the killings 
a prosecution psychiatrist testified that list had an obsessive 
personality but suffered from little more than a midlife crisis 
on the day of the slayings witnesses said list ate meals before 
and after shooting his victims even cleaning the house and washing 
the dishes 
he calmly withdrew money from the bank and left instructions for 
funerals and for wrapping up his financial affairs even leaving a 
note for the milkman and labeling a desk drawer which contained 
the pistols he used guns and ammo

a car bomb attack that killed 20 people 
including eight members of an elite police antidrug squad was 
part of a terrorist campaign being waged by drug traffickers 
anonymous callers said 
police fearing more attacks set up dozens of checkpoints and 
increased patrols in medellin today cocaine traffickers have 
targeted police in the northern city of 2 million in retaliation 
for the governments antidrug campaign 
the bomb packing 220 pounds of dynamite exploded wednesday 
beside a crowded highway as a truck carrying 21 officers of the 
elite police unit passed by the explosion badly damaged buildings 
and cars nearby 
police said the death toll from the blast rose to 20 early today 
after four civilians who had been critically wounded in the attack 
died at hospitals more than 100 people were wounded including the 
other 13 police officers in the truck 
we are expecting more attacks by the medellin cartel and for 
that reason we are increasing security measures in a drastic 
manner a medellin police spokesman said in a telephone 
interview he refused to give his name 
police also increased increased vehicle checkpoints in bogota 
the capital where one week ago police deactivated a truck bomb 
packing 1650 pounds of dynamite 
in december traffickers exploded a 1100pound truck bomb at 
security police headquarters in bogota and 63 people were killed 
anonymous callers to newspapers said wednesdays attack was 
carried out by the extraditables a name used by drug traffickers 
who are fighting government efforts to extradite them to the united 
states 
the callers warned that more bombings would be staged in 
retaliation for what they claimed was the torture and murder of 
drug traffickers by the police the government has denied the 
allegations of brutality 
we accept responsibility for what happened in medellin a 
caller to the el tiempo newspaper said late wednesday if the 
torture continues we are not going to leave a single policeman 
alive 
the chief of police operations gen octavio vargas denied the 
traffickers accusations in a radio interview today with the rcn 
network he said medellin cocaine cartel leader pablo escobar had 
begun killing his own people because he feared betrayal 
in bogota the news program tv hoy reported that senior 
police sources said the bombing was ordered by medellin cocaine 
cartel leader pablo escobar the program quoted police as saying 
that they had irrefutable evidence of escobars involvement 
the unit the slain police officers belonged is charged with 
battling terrorism by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas the 
force has received training in colombia from us and british 
security personnel in recent months 
the explosion occurred as thousands of colombians drove out of 
medellin to begin holy week vacations radio reports said it left a 
7footdeep hole in the highway 
in the port of cartagena president virgilio barco said he was 
sorry to receive such bad news the radio network rcn reported 
colombias security forces will not rest interior minister 
horacio serpa said in an interview with the noticiero national 
news program the government will pursue criminals no matter what 
sacrifice is involved 
authorities say escobar has placed a price of 4290 on the head 
of each police officer in medellin and they blame gunmen working 
for the medellin cartel for the murders of 19 police officers last 
week 
the traffickers said in a communique friday that they would step 
up their war against police and the countrys political and 
business elite 
late last month the cartel promised to bomb bogota because the 
government has refused to stop extraditing suspected drug 
traffickers to the united states barcos administration has 
extradited 15 drug suspects in the last eight months 
security forces blame escobar for masterminding the bombing 
campaign and other attacks that began shortly after the government 
intensified its usbacked crackdown on traffickers in august 
more than 200 people were killed in bombings and assassinations 
blamed on drug bosses before they declared a unilateral truce on 
jan 17 
but the government then resumed extraditions of drug suspects to 
the united states ending a twomonth hiatus and the traffickers 
said they were renewing their terror campaign because their offer 
to negotiate peace had been rejected

bradley clerical supervisor for the the city parking division 
the irs had to pay 95 for five tickets a 25 removal fee plus 
250 for processing to get the boot taken off 
with april 15ths taxfiling deadline closing in courthouse 
employees were chuckling about the irs misfortune wednesday 
but the agency was not amused 
were not pleased with it said spokesman holger euringer 
no one is ever happy to see a boot on their car and that 
includes the federal government but we can certainly understand 
why some taxpayers would find that rather humorous 
euringer said the agency would track down the employees who got 
the tickets and seek reimbursement

equipment ordered by iraq and impounded at an 
english port could be used as a barrel of a large artillery gun 
the customs and excise office said today 
arms experts said a gun of the size seized by customs 
130feetlong with a 40inch bore could fire nuclear or chemical 
warheads as far as tehran or tel aviv each within 350 miles of 
iraqs borders 
the manufacturer and the iraqi government insisted that the 
equipment was a pipe intended for use in a petrochemical plant 
customs officers seized the equipment tuesday night and the 
agency said it was investigating whether there had been a violation 
of the british embargo on arms shipments to iraq 
we are now satisfied that this equipment is covered by the 
munitions list of the export of goods control order 1989 customs 
chief douglas tweddle said this afternoon 
there is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large 
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size it is 
definitely subject to export licensing controls 
the goods are now seized investigations will continue to 
prove intent and to establish whether offenses have been 
committed tweddle said 
he said the guns capability was confirmed by ministry of 
defense experts who inspected the cargo today on the docks at 
middlesbrough in northeastern england 
executives at sheffield forgemasters which has been identified 
as the manufacturer were in a meeting and not immediately 
available for comment according to a woman who answered the 
telephone at the plant 
on march 28 customs officials seized usmade atomic bomb 
triggers that were bound for iraq iraqi president saddam hussein 
last week threatened to use missiles armed with chemical warheads 
against israel if it attacked any iraqi facilities iraq has 
confirmed it has chemical weapons but denied that it is seeking a 
nuclear capability 
the seizure of the triggers and iraqs execution on march 15 of 
a british reporter convicted of spying have soured britishiraqi 
relations iraq has accused britain and israel of orchestrating an 
antiiraqi campaign 
everything that is said about these pipes is baseless said 
naiel hassan press attache at the iraqi embassy in london 
the british and the israelis are trying to make a fuss about 
this matter even the company itself said that these pipes are used 
for only petrochemical industries hassan said 
a spokesman for sheffield forgemasters which has been 
identified in news reports as the manufacturer said earlier today 
that the government department of trade and industry approved the 
order 
the department of trade saw specifications drawings 
everything we were supplying a pipe for a petrochemical production 
unit said company spokesmn tony peck 
sheffield forgemasters chief executive phillip wright said 
earlier today that his company had been approached by iraq to make 
a gun barrel but the company took the governments advice and 
refused 
what we made were a series of tubes and they are not like any 
sort of a gun wright said we do make gun barrels and in fact 
they are immediately recognizable 
a spokesman for the department of trade said it was department 
policy not to comment on dealings with individual companies 
a customs spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
officers raided offices in the northern english steelmaking city 
of sheffield and in the industrial city of birmingham in central 
england on wednesday 
he said they took away papers relevant to the specifications 
ordering and delivery arrangements for this piece of equipment 
a spokesman for walter somers ltd in halesowen near 
birmingham said customs officers seized documents there on 
wednesday the spokesman said the company produced some steel 
piping of very much smaller dimensions for iraq in 1988 and had 
no pending orders from the country 
the unidentified customs spokesman said the goods were consigned 
to iraq and were being loaded aboard a ship chartered by the iraqi 
maritime agency 
britain banned all arms sales to iraq and its enemy iran 
following the outbreak of the eightyear persian gulf war 
there has been a ceasefire since 1988 but iran and iraq are 
still not officially at peace and the british embargo remains 
two weeks ago customs officers seized 40 americanmade 
components for nuclear bomb triggers as they were being put aboard 
an iraqi airways flight to baghdad five people were arrested 
three are facing charges one was deported and one was released 
the iraqis are widely believed to be building a nuclear bomb 
and there has been increasing concern about the countrys weapons

with his strong ties to west germany the 
first freely elected leader of east germany lothar de maiziere is 
wellequipped to lead the former communist bastion to unification 
and democracy 
de maiziere was confirmed as prime minister by the countrys 
first democratically elected parliament on thursday after leading 
the alliance for germany to victory in elections march 18 
the 50yearold lawyers political skills were tested in two 
weeks of tough negotiations with other mainstream parties that 
resulted in a broad governing coalition the agreement gives de 
maiziere a twothirds majority needed in parliament to pass 
constitutional changes required for quick unification with west 
germany 
the new prime minister was little known in the west before he 
assumed leadership of the christian democratic union or cdu on 
nov 10 after the opening of east germanys borders 
de maiziere who is married with four children belongs to a 
prominent huguenot family with strong links to west germany his 
uncle ulrich held a top post in the west german army and his 
cousin thomas is spokeman for the cdus sister party in west 
berlin 
de maiziere was born march 2 1940 in nordhausen now an east 
german town close to the west german border 
like many germans he stayed away from politics immediately 
after the trauma of the nazi era and world war ii 
his first love was music and his proficiency in playing the 
viola won him a place in various orchestras in east berlin in the 
1960s 
but the musician was drawn to law he earned a degree from east 
berlins prestigious humboldt university in 1975 
de maiziere made a name for himself by defending conscientious 
objectors and independent political activists 
for many years he headed the lutheran church council 
but the lawyer and musician was also drawn to politics de 
maiziere joined the christian democrats in 1956 when they were 
allied with the communist party but he never numbered among the 
top ranks of party officials 
when communist rule crumbled under popular pressure last fall 
east germany needed credible politicians to manage the crisis and 
help with the merger of the two germanys de maiziere became deputy 
prime minister in the caretaker government of reformminded 
communist hans modrow 
the governing christian democrats of west germany at first 
snubbed the weaker east german cdu and de maiziere fearing they 
were too tainted by long links with the communists 
de maiziere boldly risked alienating voters by acknowledging 
early on that the cdu had received funds from the communist party 
he earned credibility 
once accepted by west german chancellor helmut kohls party de 
maiziere fell in line with the west german cdus wishes and came 
out in favor of quick unification 
with a clear mandate to seek unification de maiziere set about 
opening coalition talks under the shadow of links with the hated 
stasi as the disbanded communist secret police was known there 
have been allegations many members of the new parliament including 
de maiziere collaborated with the stasi de maiziere denied the 
allegations 
he also has faced charges he is too close to the kohl government 
and will not protect east german interests during unification talks 
later this year 
however he dispelled some doubts when he opposed a west german 
central bank proposal to convert east german marks to west german 
marks at a 21 conversion rate de maiziere said he wants a 11 
conversion

superstitions generally cast friday the 13th 
into a bad luck day for the socalled triskaidekaphobics who 
fear it but the number 13 also has some good signs 
in this liberty bell city the 13 colonies declared independence 
and the 13letter slogan e pluribus unum is placed on us 
coins 
also philadelphia is the headquarters for the friday the 13th 
club founded 54 years ago by 13 men limits membership to 13 and 
only meets on friday the 13th 
we replace members only when someone dies or leaves town 
member arthur klein said of the club whose theme is to defy all 
the superstitutions 
this friday the 13th the club will gather at 813 am in a 
paint warehouse where chairman max buten has assembled some 
ladders not only will members walk under the ladders they also 
will open black umbrellas break mirrors and spill salt they may 
even have a few black cats 
scared 
not us said klein who wouldnt say if he would be carrying 
a rabbits foot or would be knocking on wood when walking under the 
ladders 
as soon as this meetings over im asking for a substantial 
premium reduction on my warehouses catastrophe insurance buten 
said 
nordic myth has it that number 13 first became unlucky a few 
thousand years ago when at a banquet of a dozen benevolent gods 
an uninvited bad god intruded and started a fight that killed the 
most popular god 
another explanation for calling it a bad day was that jesus was 
crucified on a friday and there were 13 at his last supper 
many buildings omit 13 when numbering floors some hospitals 
dont have a room 13 some people wont start a trip on the 13th 
klein isnt worried about defying the superstitions

a latestarting easter selling season and a 
continuing auto slump combined to push march retail sales down for 
the second straight month the government said thursday 
sales fell 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1486 billion 
after a 03 percent drop in february the commerce department 
reported 
the drop was the steepest in five months and marked the first 
backtoback sales slump since october and november 1986 only food 
stores posted higher sales 
consumers seem to be much more wary of spending money than 
they had been said economist s jay levy of levy economic 
forecasts in chappaqua ny with home prices in many areas of 
the country falling i think this gives pause to many people 
stock prices rose immediately after the reports release the 
new indication of continued sluggish economic growth suggested less 
upward pressure on interest rates than had been feared lately 
however analysts pointed to a number of mitigating factors that 
softened the news 
february sales originally reported as falling 09 percent and 
later revised to a minus 08 percent were revised upward again 
this time sharply 
both months followed a very strong january increase of 28 
percent 
easter this year falls three weeks later than it did last year 
some clothing and department store sales that would have occurred 
in march with an earlier easter were thus shifted to april 
march was weak but to me it was a deceptive weakness said 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co its another 
one of those moreofthesame reports the consumer is sort of 
doing what the economy is doing hes plodding ahead but not in a 
straight line 
sales in the first three months of the year were up 55 percent 
from the same period of 1989 however some of the gain was 
attributed to unseasonably mild weather and auto discounting in 
january 
i think first quarter sales borrowed from the spring and 
that could show up in depressing the april number said 
economist maury n harris of paine webber inc 
retail sales which account for about a third of all economic 
activity are closely watched as a barometer of economic health 
in recent months consumer demand particularly for highpriced 
items such as autos has been weakened by the federal reserve 
boards policy of using high interest rates to dampen demand and 
consequently inflationary pressures 
car dealers and auto parts stores reported their fifth sales 
decline in six months sales totaled 307 billion in march down 
14 percent after a 65 percent drop in february 
excluding the volatile auto sector sales fell 04 percent in 
march after strong gains of 15 percent in february and 11 percent 
in january 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years slumped 08 percent in march after a 27 
percent drop a month earlier sales of nondurable goods fell 05 
percent after rising 11 percent in february 
in other sectors march sales fell 1 percent at department and 
other general merchandise stores 05 percent at clothing stores 
01 percent at furniture outlets 08 percent at building supply 
hardware and garden stores 17 percent at gasoline stations 15 
percent at restaurants and bars and 09 percent at drug stores 
they rose 02 percent at food stores

wool and mohair producers are getting about 
100 million in subsidies because 1989 market prices fell below the 
federal support level the agriculture department said thursday 
the 100 million in payments which are to begin immediately 
will be split equally between wool and mohair producers officials 
said 
last years federal support level for shorn wool was 177 per 
pound but the national average market price was only 124 per 
pound mohair supports were set at nearly 459 per pound while 
the 1989 average market price was 158 per pound 
the usda announcement on wool and mohair subsidies followed a 
report this week by the general accounting office urging congress 
to consider the need for the wool and mohair program as lawmakers 
deliberate the 1990 farm bill 
since price supports for wool and mohair were established by the 
national wool act was passed in 1954 federal subsidies to 
producers have totaled about 2 billion the gao said

opponents of a state welfare experiment 
that cuts benefits for families whose teenagers play hooky are 
pressuring the government to withdraw its permission for the 
program 
but gov tommy g thompson who introduced the learnfare program 
two years ago wants to expand the program to include elementary 
school children 
hes also considering plans that would refuse to increase 
benefits to single mothers who have more children while on welfare 
rolls and would allow welfare recipients to work more than 100 
hours a month and still receive benefits 
we think wisconsin deserves it said thompson a republican 
who is up for reelection this fall wisconsin is recognized as a 
leader in welfare reform and well continue to move forward 
while thompson forges ahead with the experiments church and 
social groups are organizing their opposition to learnfare saying 
the state is moving too fast with programs that penalize the poor 
learnfare cuts aid to families with dependent children benefits 
to families whose teenagers skip school without an excuse afdc 
benefits in wisconsin range from 249 to 983 a month depending on 
family size 
learnfare cuts those benefits by 20 to 192 a month for each 
month a familys child or children fail to regularly attend school 
food stamps and other public assistance are not affected 
about 2200 of the estimated 30000 teenagers whose families 
receive afdc have been penalized each month most are in the 
milwaukee area 
supporters such as thompson argue that education is the first 
step to breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and that learnfare 
encourages students to stay in school 
opponents point to a recent study conducted by university of 
wisconsinmilwaukee that showed only 28 percent of children whose 
families were punished under learnfare returned to school and 
remained there for at least two months 
an earlier analysis by the state had estimated that about 70 
percent of the violators returned to school 
carol croce executive director of the wisconsin nutrition 
program a madisonbased advocacy group said learnfare unfairly 
sanctions parents and doesnt get at why the kid is missing 
school by taking away that money youre plunging them further 
into poverty 
ms croces group is among nearly 20 church and community 
organizations statewide that have jointly asked us secretary of 
health and human services louis sullivan to abolish learnfare on 
the grounds that it causes families undue hardship 
others joining in include the milwaukee catholic archdiocese 
the milwaukee urban league the naacp the league of women voters 
and the national association of social workers 
we all came to the realization after the release of the 
uwmilwaukee study that all of our worst fears had been justified 
that learnfare harms families who are in distress said mike 
soika a spokesman for the milwaukee catholic archdiocese 
in washington two wisconsin democrats sen herbert h kohl and 
rep jim moody cautioned sullivan not to grant thompson permission 
to expand the program until more statistics are compiled 
it may be premature to grant a waiver for a program that 
hasnt proved its effectiveness said marcus kunian a spokesman 
for moody 
thompsons request to expand learnfare remains under 
consideration and a final decision has not been made said david 
siegel spokesman for the family support administration of the us 
department of health and social services 
on a national level the american public welfare association a 
washingtonbased professional organization for social workers 
considered including a learnfare model program in proposed 1986 
welfare changes but decided against taking a position 
some felt it was too punitive said kathy patterson 
spokeswoman for the association the people we represent are very 
much divided on the learnfare model 
ms patterson said many states certainly are looking with 
interest at learnfare and await more comprehensive studies of it 
whether or not thompson succeeds in expanding learnfare 
opposition to the program wont stop ms croce said well work 
to make the administration accountable she said

the school superintendent has removed 
her personal tanning chair from her office after protests that it 
was in poor taste giving an appearance of luxury while the school 
and town face severe budget problems 
the chair with an ultraviolet lamp attached also took up space 
that had been used by a town agency 
superintendent concetta verge said she had the equipment at 
school because her husband would not allow her to use it at home 
she said he considered it harmful to her health ultraviolet light 
has been linked to skin cancer 
its gone its been removed she said wednesday 
this is silly she said of the furor raised over the tanning 
equipment 
people who have talked to me arent too happy said joseph 
bilotta chairman of the selectmen things are tight and people 
take offense 
marcella collier a member of the school committee said the 
tanning equipment did not enhance the superintendents image in the 
conservative northcentral massachusetts town 
i requested to go see it and make sure it was going to be 
removed she said 
im totally outraged said resident mary alatalo its 
more than bizarre because the town is squeezing every department 
for everything theyve got 
massachusetts has a 23 billion budget deficit and has had to 
sharply cut aid to local governments forcing schools to make deep 
cuts at one point lunenberg had to close its town library 
mrs verge said she had been keeping the equipment temporarily 
in the school until it could be moved to a relatives home 
the chair was in a hallway alcove adjoining her office and was 
walled off on three sides by doors that were propped up against it 
the space had housed a desk file cabinet and telephone 
belonging to the town conservation commission but last fall mrs 
verge said the school department needed the space and the 
commission had to truck its gear across town to a parks department 
garage

the national organization for women is 
stepping up its fundraising efforts for campaigns over ballot 
initiatives in oregon and nevada states now officials on thursday 
called the newest battlegrounds over abortion 
we do not intend to lose oregon said now president molly 
yard promising a strong fight against two proposed ballot 
questions that would limit abortion in the traditionally liberal 
state 
what they are deciding is going to affect every woman in this 
country she said it is not a state issue it is a national 
issue 
she said the group is holding rallies in oregon to fight the 
proposed initiatives and in nevada to support a prochoice 
referendum there 
the emotional abortion debate has focused on the states since a 
supreme court ruling in a missouri case last year gave state 
legislators greater power to regulate abortion since then both 
sides have fought over moves by state lawmakers and ballot 
questions to change local laws 
this week new hampshire gov judd gregg a republican vetoed a 
bill he said would have been the most liberal abortion law in the 
country 
antiabortion activists in oregon are gathering signatures to 
place two questions on the ballot this fall that would put new 
limits on abortion in that state 
they believe if they can win in one of the most progressive 
states in the nation they will have an impact across the 
country said sheri odell a now vice president 
yard said that abortion rights activists hope to head off 
possible action by nevadas legislature which does not meet this 
year but is considered strongly antiabortion the plan is to 
pass a law through initiative this year so the legislature cant 
touch the question she said 
yard told a press conference that now will use rallies in both 
states to step up its efforts to raise money and recruit new 
prochoice activists 
we know we are up against a very wellfinanced right wing in 
this country she said they pass the collection plate at 
evangelical churches they pass the collection plate at roman 
catholic churches it is a very quick source of money 
a spokeswoman for the national right to life committee said 
thursday officials were not immediately available for comment about 
nows new plans 
odell said now officials hope to spend 500000 to stop the 
antiabortion ballot measures in oregon and 300000 to pass the 
prochoice initiative in nevada 
yard said the abortion debate is also causing more women to run 
for office 
she said 91 women in pennsylvania have announed plans to run for 
the state legislature there partly in response to antiabortion 
legislation in the state seventee of pennsylvanias 253 lawmakers 
are women

maoist guerrillas attacked a base built by the 
us government as a staging ground for antidrug operations 
sparking a battle involving american civilians and peruvian police 
us officials said thursday 
no americans or peruvian police were killed or wounded in the 
hourlong battle saturday a us embassy spokesman said base 
personnel found no rebel bodies but that police believed several 
dead rebels may have been carried off after the predawn battle 
he said between 40 and 60 guerrillas attacked the base with 
small arms and grenade launchers 
it was the first attack on the new 3 million base in santa 
lucia 265 northeast of lima the base is a staging ground for 
antidrug operations in perus cocarich upper huallaga valley 
the valley is a stronghold of the maoist shining path rebels 
drug smugglers pay the rebels to operate in the area 
the guerrillas say they are defending the interests of peasant 
coca farmers from abuses by drug traffickers and the police 
the spokesman who asked that his name not be used for security 
reasons said us antidrug personnel working in the area have 
been fired on in the past although this was the biggest attack to 
date 
peruvian police sources said us helicopters were called in to 
repel a december guerrilla attack against a police post in nuevo 
progresso a town about six miles from the base embassy officials 
denied the report at the time 
an american pilot was wounded in the leg when his helicopter was 
fired on during an operation in february 1989 that prompted the 
withdrawal of us personnel from the valley until the fortified 
santa lucia base was finished in september 
us law prohibits american personnel or equipment from being 
used against guerrillas except when they are attacked during 
antidrug operations 
about 30 americans have worked out of the base since september 
they include federal drug enforcement administration agents and 
civilian helicopter pilots and mechanics working for a private 
company under contract to the us state department 
normally about 500 people are stationed there including 
peruvian police rangers and civilian eradication workers but the 
embassy spokesman said only about 120 people were there saturday 
because many of the civilians had left to vote in sundays 
presidential elections 
he said police were tipped off to a possible attack friday night 
by people abandoning their homes in the small village of santa 
lucia just outside the base 
police were dispatched to patrol the area and spotted the rebel 
column late friday night 
he said the guerrillas opened fired from across the huallaga 
river which borders the base but were too far away to be 
effective the river is about 100 yards across at that point 
the base personnel responded with small arms fire and two 
helicopters piloted by americans using nightvision goggles took 
off and attacked the rebel positions he said peruvian police 
manned the m60 machine guns aboard the helicopters 
ten uh1h huey helicopters belonging to the us state 
department are on loan to the peruvian police for use in antidrug 
operations 
the shining path launched its armed insurgency against perus 
elected government in 1980 in the southern andean highlands

must have all four feet on the 9inch pad and jump without being 
touched by their owners who can shout and pound the stage

motorists fuming over noxious tailpipe 
emissions on southern california roads are becoming smog snitches 
in record numbers officials said 
calls last month to the smog snitch hotline at the south coast 
air quality management district in el monte jumped 152 percent over 
march 1989 totals spokesman tom eichhorn said wednesday 
air quality officials attribute the success partly to a 100000 
billboard advertising campaign which shows a car belching dense 
black smoke beneath the words report this crime 1800 cut smog 
it has been a dynamite ad campaign for us eichhorn said 
the regional smog control agency placed 125 billboard ads 
throughout its jurisdiction in los angeles orange san bernardino 
and riverside counties 
you drive all the time in your car and youre always following 
all these obnoxious cars and trucks said one tipster kathleen 
felde of los angeles its a great way to get even ill 
just put it that way 
the programs success reflects how tips from cellular car phones 
have become a way of life on southern california freeways 
dona dower traffic reporter for knxam radio in los angeles 
says she typically gets 75 to 100 calls a day about traffic 
conditions from commuters with cellular car phones 
regular callers often adopt pseudonyms such as mr smog man 
or mr ed and report as many as 30 tailpipe polluters a month 
said bruce collins manager of the districts smoking vehicle 
program 
last month smog hotline operators received a record 17671 
calls compared with 7000 received in the previous march 
about 150000 complaints have been received since the hotline 
was established in june 1988 collins added 
after receiving a license plate number phoned in by a tipster 
the district tracks down the vehicles registered owner and mails a 
warning that driving an excessively smoking motor vehicle is a 
violation 
local law enforcement agencies and the california highway 
patrol will cite drivers of such vehicles and you may be subject to 
a fine of 100 the letter says 
compliance is voluntary and eichhorn estimated that about 20 
percent of the people contacted reply that theyve fixed the 
problem 
eichhorn said hes familiar with complaints that the smog snitch 
program is just another example of the big brother mentality in 
the agency 
our response is that this a voluntary program eichhorn 
said there is no ticket there is no cop knocking on the door 
this is just a letter a friendly letter well a sort of friendly 
letter telling them that their car is a problem and they could 
get a ticket 
the california highway patrol reports that the number of 
citations it has handed out also has increased mostly because of 
the addition of eight officers who work exclusively on issuing 
tailpipe citations 
citations issued from january to march 1990 reached 3170 a 25 
percent increase over the same threemonth period a year ago said

the worlds secondoldest ruling 
communist party dropped the word communism from its 
constitution thursday and set a new goal of building democratic 
humane socialism 
an extraordinary congress of the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party adopted a new party constitution and platform 
to reflect its recent acceptance of democratic reforms and 
opposition parties 
a proposal to change the partys name dropping the word 
revolutionary was defeated 
the party which is trying to change its image to keep power in 
free elections appeared to be suffering from an identity crisis 
our party remains marxistleninist party ideology chief 
tsahilgaan said but he said that marxismleninism or any other 
theories are not dogmas and that the party no longer used the 
word communism 
we now have realized that communism is a thing far away from 
us he said we are for building a humane democratic 
socialism 
asked if the party should be called communist or socialist he 
said lets leave it to you 
tsahilgaan said the new party constitution cuts the number of 
party employees gives more financial and decisionmaking power to 
local party bodies and guarantees their right to criticize the 
center 
but one party intellectual speaking on condition of anonymity 
noted that the party is keeping its cells in ministries factories 
and other work units 
nothing can change he said someone still can say you 
are a party member do this 
the congress 926 delegates continued meeting late into the 
night to elect a new central committee it will in turn select a 
new top leadership body to be renamed the presidium instead of the 
current politburo 
it was unclear if the new presidium would consist of the same 
five men who make up the politburo they were appointed less than a 
month ago after an opposition hunger strike forced out the old 
party leadership 
the communists have ruled this sovietallied pastoral nation 
with an iron grip since 1921 when the soviets helped mongolia gain 
independence from china 
following the soviet example party leaders began talking about 
reform several years ago real changes have come only in the past 
few months since young intellectuals began demonstrating they 
said they were inspired by soviet glasnost and the fall of 
communist parties in eastern europe 
we do not have great hope that the ruling party will be able 
to renew itself said batsukh chairman of the new progressive 
party which wants rapid privatization of the economy 
the new progressives said thursday they had agreed to cooperate 
with two other opposition parties the mongolian democratic party 
and the social democrats in fielding canddates for legislative 
elections tentatively planned for july 
some observers were skeptical that the parties which want 
reform at different paces would be able to cooperate already 
divisions have appeared within individual parties for example 
half the leadership of the mongolian democratic party dismissed the 
other half earlier this week in a power struggle

three clerical workers at the nations 
secondlargest public employee union charged in a federal suit 
thursday that the union had discriminated against blacks in its 
hiring and promotion decisions 
the suit filed in us district court alleged that the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees had 
violated federal civil rights laws by engaging in deliberate and 
systematic employment practices that discriminate against blacks 
afscmes employment practices are sound and within the law 
said bob harman a spokesman for the 125million member union he 
declined further comment until lawyers had reviewed the case about 
17 percent of the unions rankandfile members are black the 
union said 
the suit comes at a time when the american labor movement 
facing declining membership in recent years is trying to court 
blacks and women to rebuild strength 
the suit charged that afscme through the acts and omissions 
of its overwhelmingly white supervisory work force discriminated 
against blacks in decisions involving hiring assignments 
promotion compensation and discipline 
furthermore the suit alleged white supervisors harassed and 
disciplined blacks who complained about discriminatory practices 
the suit said that in 1988 blacks made up about 32 percent of 
the work force at the unions washington headquarters but that 
there were no black department heads last year only one of 14 
department heads was black it said 
blacks are confined to lowerlevel jobs in the organization the 
suit also contends while blacks had only 15 percent of the jobs 
paying more than 50000 a year in 1989 they held 47 percent of 
the positions in the unions four lowest pay grades the suit said

customs officers seized a huge forged steel tube 
ordered by iraq after military experts determined thursday that it 
could be used to build a gun capable of hurling nuclear or chemical 
warheads hundreds of miles 
iraq denied the accusation and the british manufacturer said 
the tube would blow up if anyone tried to use it as a gun barrel 
arms experts say a gun with a barrel the size of the tube seized 
by customs 131 feet long with a 39inch bore could fire 
artillery shells as far as tehran or tel aviv each within 350 
miles of iraqs borders such a weapon would be the longest gun 
ever made 
there is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large 
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size it is 
definitely subject to export licensing controls said douglas 
tweddle head of the customs and excise office 
on march 28 customs officials seized usmade parts for atomic 
bomb triggers that were bound for iraq iraq has confirmed it has 
chemical weapons but denied seeking a nuclear capability 
last week iraqi president saddam hussein threatened to use 
missiles armed with chemical warheads against israel if israel 
attacked his country 
the seizure of the triggers and iraqs execution march 15 of a 
britishbased reporter convicted of spying have soured 
britishiraqi relations 
even if we bought a box of chocolates from britain they would 
say iraq will use it to produce an atom bomb iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz told reporters in mosul iraq 
everything that is said about these pipes is baseless said 
naiel hassan press attache at the iraqi embassy in london the 
british and the israelis are trying to make a fuss about this 
matter even the company itself said that these pipes are used for 
only petrochemical industries 
the iraqi government and the reported manufacturer sheffield 
forgemasters had insisted the equipment impounded was a pipe 
designed for a petrochemical plant the company said the 
governments department of trade and industry had reviewed and 
approved the project 
phillip wright chief executive of sheffield forgemasters said 
the company had been approached by iraqis about building gun 
barrels but the company refused after consulting the british 
government 
customs officials are convinced that the impounded tube is 
covered by government rules banning the export of certain 
munitions tweddle said 
britain banned all arms sales to iraq and its enemy iran 
following the outbreak of the eightyear persian gulf war there 
has been a ceasefire since 1988 but iran and iraq are still not 
officially at peace and the british embargo remains 
the goods are now seized investigations will continue to 
prove intent and to establish whether offenses have been 
committed tweddle said 
the equipment impounded at the northeastern english port of 
middlesbrough tuesday night was packed in eight crates and was 
being loaded aboard a ship chartered by the iraqi maritime 
organization customs officials said 
wright said the tube seized by customs could not be used as a 
gun 
if they did manage to get all the other necessary components i 
wouldnt stand within a mile of the thing if they tried to fire it 
it would blow itself to pieces the sheffield star newspaper 
quoted wright as saying 
wright said iraqi officials had approached his company about 
making gun barrels but it declined 
what we made were a series of tubes and they are not like any 
sort of a gun he said we do make gun barrels and in fact they 
are immediately recognizable 
sheffield forgemasters confirmed that customs officers seized 
company documents wednesday 
a spokesman for walter somers ltd in halesowen near 
birmingham said customs officers also seized documents there the 
spokesman who spoke anonymously said the company produced some 
steel piping of very much smaller dimensions for iraq in 1988 
and had no pending orders from the country 
two weeks ago customs officers seized 40 americanmade 
components for nuclear bomb triggers as they were being put aboard 
an iraqi airways flight to baghdad from london five people were 
arrested three are facing charges one was deported and one was 
released 
iraq is widely believed to be building a nuclear bomb and there 
has been increasing concern about its weapons program 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the united states was asking the british government for information 
about the impounding action and would have no comment for the time 
being 
british news reports speculated that an iraqi gun project could 
be linked to gerald bull an american ballistics expert who was 
killed in brussels on march 22 bull 62 a canadianborn american 
citizen was found shot to death with 20000 in his pockets 
belgian police said 
janes defense weekly said bull had been a principal designer of 
south africas g5 howitzers which have been sold to iraq in 1980 
he was convicted in vermont where he had taught at norwich 
university on charges of smuggling arms to south africa

at what they billed as their largest 
congress ever gypsies from 27 countries demanded respect for their 
culture and an end to the stereotypes that have long seen them 
scorned as thieving fortunetellers 
the weeklong meeting of some 300 delegates ended wednesday with 
the appeals from the worldwide wanderers that they be treated as 
any other disadvantaged minority 
delegates to the fourth congress of the world of romany union 
discussed issues including standardizing their roma language 
discrimination memorializing gypsy victims of the naziholocaust 
and the potential dangers for gypsies posed by rising nationalism 
in eastern europe 
sessions were held at a steel mills country recreation center 
24 miles north of warsaw after somber speeches during the day the 
delegates gathered for singing and dancing in unbridled celebration 
of their heritage 
the conference was conducted in the gypsy roma language but 
with 20 major dialects worldwide delegates sometimes had difficulty 
making themselves understood to all participants 
gypsies or the romany as they prefer to be known are descended 
from nomadic tribes that left northwestern india sometime during 
the first millenium and made their first recorded appearance in 
western europe early in the 1400s 
their worldwide population is variously estimated at 5 million 
to more than 10 million 
the romany have been associated in popular lore with 
fortunetelling stealing and musicmaking and conference 
participants said the stereotypes had been forced upon them by 
gaje or nongypsies 
nobody takes us seriously said ian hancock a britishborn 
gypsy who teaches linguistics at the university of texas at austin 
we are one people who arrived in europe 800 years ago who have 
become fragmented by the hostility we encountered from europeans 
but now we must work toward becoming one people again he said 
the meeting elected poet rajko djuric of yugoslavia as president 
of the world romany union 
the union calls on all governments to treat gypsies as human 
beings djuric said we call for giving them the right to life 
and their own culture and language 
the first world meeting was held in 1971 in london but this was 
the first that delegates from the soviet union and albania were 
able to attend 
thanks to perestroika and democratization we are here said 
lev cerenkov of moscow who came with 15 other soviet citizens 
in the soviet union and most warsaw pact countries gypsies were 
forced by communist governments to give up their nomadic lifestyles 
after world war ii 
their horses were shot or taken away and the wheels removed from 
their painted wagons some still live in dilapidated barracks given 
to them at that time said stanislaw stankiewicz of poland 
europes gypsy population was devastated during the holocaust 
when 500000 to 1 million were put to death in gas chambers 
the genocide was only the culmination of the persecution for the 
gypsies hancock said many countries banned gypsies and some 
permitted them to be used as slaves or hunted 
the romantic interpretation of the wandering gypsy is not 
romantic at all hancock said it is really life on the run 
today gypsies suffer from lower education levels income and 
life expectancy than their nongypsy neighbors and often have 
trouble obtaining basic services or recognition hancock said 
if gypsies steal it is often subsistence theft to feed 
their families when discrimination prevents them from obtaining 
honest work he said 
we are thirdclass citizens said rudko kawczinski a former 
member of the european parliament from hamburg west germany 
the political changes in eastern europe which the west sees 
as very positively is starting to look bad for gypsies there is a 
backlash of prejudice against minorities hancock said 
there were many signs at the meeting of gypsy pride however 
many delegates sported gypsy flag lapel pins which are blue and 
green with a spoked wheel in the center the wheel of fire is 
from indian mythology and represents the gypsies origins in india 
hancock said 
some delegates said the romany must become more involved in 
politics at home 
what is important is getting people to notice us on this globe 
and understanding out culture and traditions said stankiewicz 
of bialystok who recently founded polands first romalanguage 
newspaper

brazils congress gave a major 
victory to president fernando collor de mello by passing intact the 
heart of his draconian antiinflation plan economists said a 
severe recession is a certainty 
in a surprising vote late wednesday legislators passed by 
249204 a measure that froze for 18 months all bank deposits of 
more than 1200 and money market deposits of more than 600 
i am extremely satisfied with the result of the congressional 
session collor told reporters as he headed for a pizzeria in 
brasilia to celebrate 
collor decreed the measure as part of a series of reforms 
launched mar 16 the day after he took office he said it was 
central to his strategy of beating 4854 percent annual inflation 
economic minister zelia cardoso de mello was exultant after the 
vote and said the legislators action would ensure the success of 
the new brazil plan 
but economists agreed that collors plan will produce a brutal 
recession at least in the short term 
a recession is inevitable its duration will depend on the 
governments future conduct of economic policy but i would not be 
surprised to see a 20 percent drop in industrial production over 
the next three months said edmar bacha an economist 
bacha who supports the plan said an economic downturn was 
necessary to end chronic inflation 
signs of an impending recession are everywhere the automobile 
capital goods construction and machine tools industries are 
virtually paralyzed unions say almost 1 million workers have 
either been fired taken pay cuts or been put on collective 
holiday 
the government will have to create special credit lines for 
badly hit sectors to prevent the recession from getting out of of 
control said mario henrique simonsen a conservative economist 
who served as finance minister between 1974 and 1979 when brazil 
was run by a rightwing military regime 
simonsen said the depth of the recession would depend on the 
publics confidence in the plan 
the bank confiscation has shaken the shortterm confidence of 
investors and savers in the financial system how they react in the 
longer term will be crucial he said 
leftist economists were especially critical 
we are going to have a deep and long depression you cant 
solve economic problems with this sort of drastic solution said 
paul singer a leading economist with the socialist workers party 
he said the workers party favored collective bargaining of wages 
and prices between labor unions and business to bring down 
inflation without producing a recession 
i am afraid of very serious social convulsions this downturn 
will be far worse than the 1983 recession he said during that 
recession the economy fell by 3 percent resulting in widescale 
looting of supermarkets and an increase in urban violence 
the logic of the plan is to paralyze the economy for several 
months and then make the recession tolerable but the shock was so 
strong im not sure how long it will be before we reach the 
tolerable stage said rep cesar maia an economist and spokesman 
for the centerleft democratic labor party 
maia criticized the government for not increasing unemployment 
benefits and taking other measures to cushion the blow for those 
who are directly hit by the recession but he said if the 
government managed the plan well the economy could begin to grow 
again in about a year 
simonsen said the longterm success of the plan depends on what 
happens when the government begins returning the money in frozen 
bank accounts

republican party chairman lee atwater 
described as in fighting trim was released thursday from a new 
york hospital where he was treated for a brain tumor 
hes in excellent spirits said dr paul kornblith the 
neurologist who treated atwater at montefiore medical center 
hes quite enthusiastic hes gaining strength physically 
kornblith led a team that implanted radioactive isotopes in the 
tumor on the right side of atwaters brain physicians hope the 
isotopes will halt the growth of the tumor and kill the cancerous 
cells 
the 39yearold atwater also is undergoing chemotherapy 
treatments designed to destroy any tumor cells on the periphery of 
the lesion 
kornblith said it would be two or three months before it could 
be determined how effective the treatments were if successful he 
said a neurological scan would show the area has diminished in 
size or is not growing 
while no further radiation was planned atwater will continue 
taking oral doses of chemotherapy every six weeks 
aides have said atwater would spend the next couple of weeks at 
his washington home regaining his strength 
knowing him i think hes going to be working to some degree 
probably by next week kornblith said hes in fighting trim 
and ready to fight the wars of his profession 
hes already working hes meeting with people talking to 
people how active hell be hell have to judge for himself 
mary matalin chief of staff at the republican national 
committee said she talked to atwater on the telephone as many as 
six times a day while he was hospitalized 
atwater also talked by telephone nearly every day with president 
bush and white house staff chief john sununu 
former president richard m nixon sent atwater a copy of his new 
book in the arena it was inscribed to lee atwater i cant 
think of anyone id rather be in the arena with 
atwaters wife sally was expecting to give birth to their 
third child within days atwater also was celebrating the release 
of a rhythm and blues album red hot and blue on which he 
plays guitar and sings with blues artists bb king isaac hayes 
and billy preston 
the album was selling out in stores in the nations capital 
matalin said 
kornblith said tumorrelated problems atwater was having on his 
left side had gotten a hell of a lot better he thinks hell be 
able to play the guitar soon 
as for the coming weeks matalin said it would be a different 
kind of waiting the radiation waiting was for his instincts that 
was not a good procedure it just didnt match his personality it 
was too slow a process for him 
the tumor was diagnosed march 6 after atwater collapsed while 
speaking at a political breakfast it first was described as a 
nonmalignant growth that could be treated easily with daily 
radiation doses 
atwater was given medication to prevent additional seizures and 
to ward off nausea from the radiation treatments he briefly 
reentered a washington hospital two weeks later after suffering 
dizziness attributed to problems adjusting the dosage of his 
medication 
he flew to new york on april 2 to enter a new and more 
aggressive treatment program under kornblith 
after examining atwater kornblith said that while the tumor was 
quite small it was aggressive and dangerous the growth 
called an astrocytoma is the most common type of brain tumor 
tumors undergoing unrestrained growth cause pressure within the 
closed skull that could kill normal brain cells bringing eventual 
death by destroying vital functions

the veterans affairs department wants to 
reverse its shortage of registered nurses by pegging pay to local 
rates in private hospitals 
while the plan would apply only to registered nurses it would 
move the government in the direction of paying its employees at 
levels comparable to those of private industry a goal of unions 
that represent federal workers 
it could be the precedent that gets us going through the work 
force said janice lachance spokeswoman for the 700000member 
american federation of government employees 
draft legislation given to the senate this week also would add 
pay incentives for nurse managers and supervisors 
the veterans affairs department is the nations largest employer 
of registered nurses with 35000 of them at work in its hospitals 
clinics and nursing homes 
starting base pay for a registered nurse employed by the 
department is 18174 the american nurses association the average 
starting salary nationwide for a registered nurse is 25261 
the american federation of government employees had opposed 
cocalled locality pay in the past but it now favors the concept 
as long as such a system includes safeguards advocated by the 
union ms lachance said she did not know whether the departments 
bill included those safeguards 
the administration last month proposed a pay scale for federal 
employees that accounts for local pay but the federal employee 
unions object to a feature of the proposal that eliminates step 
increases in certain job categories and instead links pay to 
performance 
under the proposal made by veterans affairs secretary edward j 
derwinski the department would use pay data from private hospitals 
to establish community rates 
but the national scale for nurses employed by the department 
would serve as a floor under their pay and the community rates 
would go into effect only if they exceeded that level 
also limits on certain categories overtime for some nurses 
would be lifted and pay rates would be flexible for certain 
nursespecialists premium pay increases would be given to head 
nurses and incentive pay would be allowed for nurse managers and 
executives 
the department already has made some adjustments to move closer 
to local rates but the process has proven so slow that the 
government has not caught up with levels in the private health care 
industry 
the department was paying special rates at 130 of its 172 
medical centers at year ago derwinski said 
even with the special rates va has not been able to offer 
competitive salaries at certain geographic locations such as 
boston southern california and new york city derwinski said in a 
letter to lawmakers 
committees in both the house and senate have been working on pay 
legislation for nurses and a similar measure for physicians and 
dentists also is on the drawing board

a former top legal adviser to us 
attorney general dick thornburgh is the target of a federal 
investigation of alleged cocaine use by public officials and 
professionals sources said thursday 
henry g barr of mechanicsburg who was general counsel when 
thornburgh was governor and later was an assistant to thornburgh 
when he became attorney general is being investigated by the same 
grand jury that has been hearing evidence about alleged cocaine use 
and distribution by richard guida a former top deputy in the state 
attorney generals office the sources said 
the sources including several lawyers close to the case who 
were interviewed independently said barrs attorneys were in 
washington earlier this week asking the justice department to block 
an indictment that would name barr 
in washington justice department spokesman dan eramian said 
thornburgh and members of his personal staff withdrew from the 
federal investigation when they learned of its existence earlier 
this year 
eramian added that thornburgh had no knowledge of the drug issue 
when he was governor 
the sources also said guida has agreed to plead guilty to one 
count of using cocaine and to cooperate with the federal 
investigation under the agreement they said guida could face a 
short jail term and suspension of his law license 
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because grand jury 
proceedings are supposed to be secret 
according to court documents guida has been a target of the 
federal investigation since may the grand jurys attention turned 
to barr more recently the sources said 
barr did not return telephone messages left on the answering 
machine at his mechanicsburg home thursday 
guida did not return messages left at his harrisburg law office 
in previous interviews he denied using cocaine and being a target 
of the probe 
assistant us attorney gordon zubrod declined to comment 
because of a policy that prohibits federal prosecutors from 
confirming or denying details of investigations 
by being allowed to plead guilty only to a possession charge 
guida would sidestep allegations that he also sold cocaine and 
provided it to friends at least one witness brenda snell of 
suburban harrisburg said in an interview with the associated press 
that she told the fbi she had purchased cocaine from guida and sold 
it to him on several occassions 
guida called those allegations boldfaced lies 
this is the second time cocaine allegations against guida have 
been investigated in 1986 when he was a chief deputy under state 
attorney general leroy s zimmerman an internal probe found no 
evidence to support a radio reporters allegations that guida was a 
user 
state attorney general ernie preate jr said thursday he would 
not investigate allegations that the initial probe was a whitewash 
because the federal grand jury also was looking at that aspect of 
the case 
barr 46 worked in the state attorney generals office before 
joining thornburghs gubernatorial administration he became 
thornburghs general counsel about 18 months before the governor 
left office in 1987 in washington he served as a special 
assistant to the attorney general from september 1988 to may 12 
1989 
last year he resumed a private law practice in harrisburg but 
quit earlier this year after allegations surfaced that connected 
him to the case the sources said 
barr and guida each served as deputy attorney general in charge 
of the state attorney generals criminal division barr also served 
as an assistant us attorney in pittsburgh from 1969 to 1979 
through much of that period thornburgh was the us attorney in 
western pennsylvania 
the grand jury investigation has lasted nearly a year

the parliaments apology thursday to jews and 
other peoples who suffered under the nazi occupation marks a 
dramatic break from four decades of denying a dark past 
in a concisely worded declaration the parliament unanimously 
declared null and void the communist version of east german 
history which trumpeted the virtues of socialism and refused 
responsibility for any tragedies inflicted in the past by germans 
on other nations 
we the first freely elected parliamentarians of the german 
democratic republic east germany acknowledge the responsibility 
of germans in the german democratic republic for its history and 
its future the declaration said 
the declaration was adopted by the parliament was chosen last 
month in east germanys first free elections after more than 40 
years of communist rule 
east germany like other former communist countries in eastern 
europe has tried to break away from the official communist 
histories that often emphasized ideology over historical accuracy 
the parliaments declaration turned first to the horrors of the 
nazi period and acknowledged that immeasurable suffering was 
inflicted on the peoples of the world by germans 
national and racial illusions led to genocide especially of 
jews from all european countries it said 
the declaration could help the process of reconciling east 
germanys historical view of the holocaust with that prevailing in 
west germany 
west germany was compelled after world war ii to confront its 
nazi past years ago it apologized for nazi atrocities and began 
paying reparations to jewish victims 
east germany long maintained its communist leaders were also 
victims of nazi repression and therefore the country bore no 
responsibility for the deaths of 6 million jews during world war ii 
in its declaration the parliament dramatically distanced itself 
from the policies of the communist government toppled from power in 
october 
the first freely elected parliament in the name of the 
citizens of this country admits joint responsibility for the 
humiliation expulsion and murder of jewish women men and 
children the declaration said we feel grief and shame and 
acknowledge this burden of german history 
it asked forgiveness for the bad treatment of jews who remained 
in the country after the war and for east germanys policy toward 
the state of israel 
the declaration pledged to do everything possible to cultivate 
jewish culture and said asylum should be granted in east germany 
for jews persecuted elsewhere in the world 
it also said east germany is prepared to make reparations to 
jewish victims and urged establishment of diplomatic relations with 
israel 
the declaration then turned to the soviet union and poland 
where millions of people died at the hands of the nazis 
we have not forgotten the terrible pain that the germans in 
the second world war inflicted on people in the soviet union 
we want to intensively continue the process of reonciliation 
between our two peoples the declaration said 
parliament said that the political changes in east germany would 
not have been possible without soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms 
it also sought to reassure poland which has expressed concern 
about german unification 
the parliament reiterated the communist governments earlier 
commitments abandoning any territorial claims on former german 
lands ceded to poland after world war ii 
the declaration said polands western border along the oder and 
neisse rivers was inviolable and should be guaranteed by a treaty 
passed by the future parliament of a united germany 
the declaration then apologized to another neighbor 
czechoslovakia for east germanys participation in the 1968 
sovietled warsaw pact invasion that crushed the prague spring 
reform movement 
out of fear and a lack of courage we did not hinder this 
breach of international law the declaration said the first 
freely elected parliament in the german democratic republic asks 
the people of czechoslovakia to pardon this occurrence of 
injustice

the estonian parliament has declared service in 
the soviet army illegal and called on president mikhail s 
gorbachev to begin immediate talks on the baltic republics 
independence soviet media reported thursday 
estonias new law on conscription says service by residents of 
estonia in the ussr armed forces is legally illegitimate and 
does away with criminal penalties for draftdodgers 
the parliamentary move accompanied by a strident letter to 
gorbachev also approved wednesday stepped up the push for 
independence in the small republic of 16 million residents 
estonia has made clear it intends to follow neighboring lithuania 
in seceding from the soviet union but more cautiously 
there was no immediate response thursday from the kremlin to the 
estonian legislature 
the law on the draft raised the prospect of new tensions when 
lithuanias legislature passed a similar measure last month the 
kremlin rejected its legality and ordered the army to detain 
deserters anyway 
military authorities raided two lithuanian hospitals where 
deserters had taken refuge and witnesses said they beat some of 
the men in the first reported violence after lithuanias march 11 
declaration of independence 
the lithuanian lawmakers have since issued statements saying 
each young conscript should decide for himself whether to respond 
to his callup order and it is not clear how the army plans to 
enforce the draft in other soviet republics with strong 
independence movements including latvia and georgia widespread 
draftdodging is also predicted 
the state news agency tass in its report on the estonian law 
complained it prods hundreds of youths to violate the soviet law 
on universal military service and the soviet constitution 
mart tarmot an estonian popular front activist said thursday 
the laws passage had evoked no particularly loud public reaction 
everybody was expecting it it was necessary to start sometime 
and weve done the first step he said in a telephone interview 
from estonias capital tallinn 
the estonian legislatures letter to gorbachev laid out 
estonias legal claims to independence and concluded with an appeal 
to immediately begin negotiations between the ussr and an 
authorized estonian delegation on the restoration of independence 
estonia like its baltic neighbors latvia and lithuania was 
forcibly annexed to the soviet union in 1940 
the letter tacitly rejected gorbachevs demands in an angry 
telephone call last week to estonian president arnold ruutel that 
the republic back down from its drive for independence 
ruutel said gorbachev called him up soon after the estonian 
parliament passed its march 30 resolution saying the republic was 
an independent country illegally occupied by the soviet union 
when i heard about your resolution i was completely beside 
myself you must declare the resolution null and void ruutel 
quoted gorbachev as telling him 
the letter told gorbachev that if he restored estonias 
independence he would eliminate a key source of political tension 
in eastern europe and raise the soviet unions prestige 
it also assured him that the full rights of all citizens would 
be respected in an independent estonia about 40 percent of the 
republics population consists of nonethnic estonians 
since elections last month the estonian parliament has been 
dominated by prosecession groups and is expected to pursue 
independence as stubbornly as the lithuanians though more slowly

officials of the united states and 
czechoslovakia signed a trade agreement thursday the second 
economic pact negotiated with an eastern european nation since last 
years political upheaval 
the new accord is one of the steps needed to cut tariffs on 
czech products sold in the united states the document also seeks 
to foster increased business ties and tourism between the two 
nations 
us trade representative carla hills participated in the 
signing ceremony along with andrej barcak the foreign trade 
minister of czechoslovakia 
hills said that the congressional legislation needed to put the 
lower tariffs into place could be completed by early summer 
the united states is also negotiating a trade agreement with the 
soviet union and hills said she was optimistic that the pact could 
be finished in time for the may 30 summit between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
both the czech and soviet trade agreements are necessary steps 
that must be taken for the united states to grant the countries 
most favored nation trade status that designation would lower 
american tariffs to the level charged against most other trading 
partners 
tariffs on products from the soviet union and czechoslovakia now 
run as much as 10 times higher than those on goods from other 
countries 
the higher tariffs were imposed as part of the jacksonvanik 
trade amendment of 1974 which congress passed in retaliation for 
communist restrictions imposed on the free emigration of dissidents 
before tariffs can be lowered the trade agreements must be in 
place and president bush must certify that both countries permit 
free emigration both houses of congress must approve the trade 
agreements 
the presidents certification is not expected to be a problem 
for either country bush has said he will make such a certification 
for the soviet union once the soviet parliament putting into law 
the current free emigration policies 
last month the united states and poland signed a business and 
investment treaty that pact did not address the tariff question 
because poland had already been awarded the lower tariffs under the 
most favored nation designation 
in addition to the treaties with poland and czechoslovakia 
hills said exploratory discussions have been held with hungary on 
adopting a new business and economic agreement 
czechus trade is now fairly small adding up to about 150 
million a year in both directions major us exports are hides 
yarns cotton and tobacco major us imports are tractors glass 
beads shoes and tires 
in his remarks to the us business executives barcak made a 
plea for american investment saying czechoslovakia was moving 
rapidly toward a market economy 
he said his nation expected to take a major step next jan 1 
toward making its currency fully convertible that would mean that 
investors could freely take their earnings home in dollars an 
important consideration to firms unwilling to tie up their cash 
abroad 
barcak also promised tax breaks for foreign investors and 
permission for them to own all the stock in new firms they 
establish without the need to take in lcoal partners 
but he said there was an ongoing debate over whether foreigners 
should be allowed to own land he said some people in the audience 
would be able to buy up all the land in czechoslovakia with a 
single check 
some of us dont want to live in a country where foreigners 
have bought up the land at its present value and then we have to 
buy it back ourselves in five years time he said

last month the united states and poland signed a business and 
investment treaty that pact did not address the tariff question 
because poland had already been awarded the lower tariffs under the 
most favored nation designation 
in addition to the treaties with poland and czechoslovakia 
hills said exploratory discussions have been held with hungary on 
adopting a new business and economic agreement 
czechus trade is now fairly small adding up to about 150 
million a year in both directions major us exports are hides 
yarns cotton and tobacco major us imports are tractors glass 
beads shoes and tires 
in his remarks to the us business executives barcak made a 
plea for american investment saying czechoslovakia was moving 
rapidly toward a market economy 
he said his nation expected to take a major step next jan 1 
toward making its currency fully convertible that would mean that 
investors could freely take their earnings home in dollars an 
important consideration to firms unwilling to tie up their cash 
abroad 
barcak also promised tax breaks for foreign investors and 
permission for them to own all the stock in new firms they 
establish without the need to take in lcoal partners 
but he said there was an ongoing debate over whether foreigners 
should be allowed to own land he said some people in the audience 
would be able to buy up all the land in czechoslovakia with a 
single check 
some of us dont want to live in a country where foreigners 
have bought up the land at its present value and then we have to 
buy it back ourselves in five years time he said

the estimated cost of the pentagons major 
weapons programs increased by 31 billion or 38 percent in the 
last quarter of 1989 because of inflation and a slight increase in 
planned missiles and ships 
the pentagon in its congressionally required report released 
thursday offered a snapshot as of dec 31 of expected overall 
costs for 95 major weapons systems if president bushs military 
budget is enacted 
however the overall estimate now 8438 billion may change 
given that congress or defense secretary dick cheney may limit 
production on or terminate some weapons systems including the c17 
cargo plane and the ddg51 guidedmissile destroyer 
the previous report released in september predicted the 
overall cost of the major systems would be 8066 billion upward 
revisions in expected inflation rates are largely responsible for 
the higher costs the pentagon said 
the difference in the two figures is 372 billion but 
comparisons on an appleswithapples basis give a difference of 31 
billion because the new estimate includes 62 billion for a navy 
program that was not in the september figure 
that program is the socalled fixed distributed system a 
classified ocean surveillance project 
one of the major increases was for the midgetman strategic 
nuclear missile now put at 73 billion an increase of 19 
billion or 35 percent over the previous estimate 
the pentagon said the jump was primarily the result of restoring 
costs expected all along but excluded last year because of the way 
bush and congress handled midgetman in the current defense budget 
the fiscal 1990 budget contains less than 250 million for the 
mobile singlewarhead landbased missile with those funds the 
midgetman program amounted to a research and development project 
this is a reinstatement of the costs said roy lietza a 
spokesman for the air force 
among the increased costs for the midgetman are 13 billion for 
the missile and its basing with a goal of initial operation in 
1997 458 million for six additional research and development 
missiles and 87 million for inflation 
the estimated cost of the multiplewarhead mx nuclear missile 
dropped 39 billion from 23 billion primarily because of a 
reduction in the number of planned missiles from 255 to 193 the 
drop was partially offset by inflation increase estimated at 236 
million 
the estimates consist of the annual costs of research and 
development purchase of the weapon itself and associated 
construction added together for the several years each weapon will 
be bought sometimes extending into the next century cost of 
operations such as fuel and crew wages are not included 
one program which cheney is currently reviewing the arleigh 
burkeclass destroyer or ddg51 increased 4 billion from a 
previous estimate of 28 billion 
the navy cited an increase in the number of ships from 33 to 38 
and revised inflation rates as the reasons for the 15 percent jump 
the other navy program the defense secretary may curtail the 
ssn21 seawolf attack submarine dropped in estimated cost from 
20 billion to 16 billion because of a decrease in the number of 
submarines from 12 to nine 
the estimated cost of the c17 cargo plane also under review 
increased 44 billion from a previous price of 374 billion the 
air force blamed the rise on inflation and schedule changes due to 
plans to stretch out the program 
slower production rates frequently raise total costs by reducing 
production efficiency 
one of the largest increases in army programs was in the medium 
tactical vehicles in which the estimated cost jumped from 86 
billion to 161 billion or 88 percent 
the army attributed the rise to an increase in the number of 
trucks from 79157 to 102322 an extension of the modernization 
program from 15 to 30 years schedule changes and inflation 
the estimated cost of the m1 tank which cheney has proposed 
canceling in the budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
dropped 6 billion due to a decrease in the number of tanks

president bush was diagnosed thursday with 
an early glaucoma in his left eye but he said it had not 
affected his vision 
the glaucoma was found during the presidents routine physical 
at bethesda naval hospital and will be treated with prescription 
eye drops press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
otherwise the 65yearold bush is in excellent health said 
white house physician dr burton lee in a statement released by the 
press office he continues to keep extremely fit through vigorous 
physical activities 
i havent felt a thing felt it at all bush told reporters 
im taking drops now one in the morning and one at night but 
the vision is very good 
fitzwaters statement said that during the examination an 
early glaucoma of his left eye was detected but that extensive 
tests showed no visual impairment 
with early detection and continual treatment the president 
should not develop vision problems said dr mansour armaly 
chairman of ophthalmology at george washington university medical 
center who did not examine bush but is a specialist in glaucoma 
although bush is not suffering impairment of his vision 
glaucoma can lead to blindness if not treated the disease is 
characterized by increased pressure and hardening of the eyeball 
it has no cure but can be controlled with drugs laser surgery 
may be performed on patients who dont respond to drugs armaly and 
other doctors said 
it is quite a high probability he will have none armaly 
said when asked about the prospects for vision problems it is a 
disease that requires regular follow up to make sure the medication 
is effective 
for the glaucoma he will receive betagan eyedrops one drop 
every 12 hours and will continue this medication permanently 
fitzwater said 
bush has had a stye in his right eye for the past week which is 
nearly gone after treatments with soaks and antibiotics fitzwater 
said 
betagan the brandname for the drug levobunolol is a 
betablocker similar to those that treat arterial high blood 
pressure that lowers the ocular pressure said armaly 
there are different types of glaucoma but all cause pressure 
within the eye as result of obstruction to the micro passages that 
allow ordinary fluid to leave the eye at the normal rate into the 
blood vessels he said 
unless the glaucoma is transitory resulting from something such 
as a previous blow to the eye it is considered a lifetime 
condition he said 
dr m bruce shields of the duke university eye center in 
durham nc said once glaucoma is found in one eye it often 
appears in the other but treatment can also save the sight in the 
second eye 
the white house reference to early glaucoma apparently means 
the nerve was not damaged enough to affect bushs vision said 
shields who is chairman of the glaucoma committee of the national 
committee to prevent blindness 
glaucoma is not unusual in a person in his 60s shields said 
the nspb estimates more than 2 million americans ages 35 and 
over have glaucoma but that nearly half are not aware of it the 
society says the disease accounts for one out of every eight cases 
of blindness in the united states 
the vision is very good the vision things working well 
bush told reporters thursday joking about his habit of attaching 
the word thing to topics critics during his 1988 presidential 
said he lacked the vision thing 
during the four hours of tests and examinations doctors also 
found that bushs hips and neck showed mild degenerative 
osteoarthritis a condition revealed in past physicals 
the white house said he also underwent chest xrays which were 
normal an electrocardiogram and stress tests which were normal 
urinalysis showing no abnormality blood tests which were normal a 
dermatology exam showing no significant problem or change 
his allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged fitzwater 
said 
bush emerged from the examination wearing sunglasses because 
his eyes had been dilated and called to reporters that he felt 
like a spring colt 
he told reporters all is well on his return to the white 
house 
the presidents last physical was may 10 1989 and he was 
pronounced in good health 
the only problem cited during last years physical was a cyst on 
the third finger of bushs right hand the cyst was surgically 
removed last october and later was found to be benign

american jewish leaders welcomed the east german 
parliaments long overdue apology thursday for the holocaust 
and said the new government must include education in its effort to 
make amends 
apology must be accompanied with deeds said benjamin meed 
president of the 65000member american gatheringfederation of 
jewish holocaust survivors they must educate future generations 
to know what their fathers did and how they will prevent it from 
happening again 
it is 45 years overdue but apology is always good added 
meed a 70yearold survivor of the warsaw ghetto 
by making the apology east germanys first freely elected 
legislature ended four decades of denials by its former communist 
leaders that the country played any role in the deaths of 6 million 
jews during world war ii 
nobody can bring back the dead but its a long overdue 
statement said rabbi a james rudin director of interreligious 
affairs of the 50000member american jewish committee 
east germanys legislature also promised to make reparations to 
israel and to seek diplomatic ties with that country israel has 
long demanded reparations and an east german apology for nazi 
crimes as a condition for diplomatic relations 
before you can have normalization there had to be admission 
of guilt remorse said rabbi arthur schneier a holocaust survivor 
and president of the interreligious appeal of conscience foundation 
this is a first step in a normalization process and it has to 
be advanced by education and reeducation said schneier all 
these years east germans were conditioned to the fact that we had 
nothing to do with it it is a great challenge to educate the 
public and particularly the younger generation as to the tragedy of 
the holocaust so that another tragedy of this kind would be 
averted 
rudin urged east germany not only to pay reparations for the 
holocaust but to join with the united states and other countries to 
seek repeal of the 1975 united nations resolution equating zionism 
with racism which was an act of antisemitism 
since theyve apologized for terrible errors of the past this 
is something else they can do to show good will and that theyve 
really changed rudin said 
unhappily east germans have followed the practice until now 
of seeking to deny what had been their history said philip baum 
associate executive director of the american jewish congress 
while the people alive now are not those who perpetrated the 
crimes they have the burden of the history of their country to 
confront and this is a gratifying sign that theyre doing it 
without selfrecognition one cant begin other steps of 
education and thats why this is terribly important said 
kenneth jacobson director of the antidefamation league division 
of international affairs 
for the last 40 years east germany has denied any role and now 
theyre beginning to look history in the eye jacobson said i 
dont think too many youngsters in that part of the world really 
understand what went on

a jury thursday convicted a former sunday 
school teacher of firstdegree murder for the 1971 deaths of his 
wife three children and mother he claimed he killed them in part 
because he feared for their souls 
john e list sat stonefaced as the five verdicts were read 
after the jury deliberated nine hours over two days jurors 
rejected lesser counts of seconddegree murder and his lawyers 
contention that list was innocent because of his mental state at 
the time 
the 64yearold list faces a mandatory life prison term at his 
sentencing may 1 there was no death penalty in effect in the state 
in 1971 
the states very gratified said union county assistant 
prosecutor eleanor j clark it deserved the verdict justice was 
not denied because of the delay 
list disappeared before authorities found the bodies of his 
relatives on dec 7 1971 in the familys 18room mansion in 
suburban westfield 25 miles from new york 
list was arrested in richmond va last june after a tip to the 
americas most wanted television show which featured the case 
his arrest ended a secret life as a fugitive spent mostly in 
denver and during which list again took up his profession as an 
accountant returned to the lutheran church and remarried he moved 
to suburban richmond in 1988 
lists attorney elijah l miller jr left the courthouse 
without commenting if a conviction was necessary miller urged the 
jury to return a seconddegree verdict because lists mental 
condition made him incapable of deliberation one of the 
necessary elements a jury must find for firstdegree murder 
psychiatric experts testified for the defense that list suffered 
from a obsessivecompulsive disorder that made him inflexible 
and unable to find solutions to his problems 
combined with lists twisted sense of religion the inability to 
support his family and a feeling they were slipping from their 
religion left list one option miller contended kill them so their 
souls could find salvation 
further pressure came from the shame and burden of his wifes 
terminal syphilis which she caught in 1943 from her first husband 
the disease made her abusive psychotic subject to frequent falls 
and unable to care for her family witnesses testified 
a prosecution psychiatrist testified that although list had an 
obsessive personality he suffered from little more than a midlife 
crisis 
the bodies of lists wife helen 46 and the couples three 
children patricia 16 john 15 and frederick 13 were lined 
up on the floor of their sparsely furnished ballroom his mother 
alma list 84 was found in her thirdfloor apartment

nasa on thursday set april 25 as the 
new launch date for space shuttle discovery and the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope the agencys most expensive and complex 
payload 
the first launch attempt was scrubbed four minutes before 
liftoff tuesday when one of discoverys three auxiliary power units 
failed 
the date is based on the decision to remove and replace apu 
no 1 on space shuttle discovery and to allow time for recharging 
the hubble space telescope batteries nasa said in a statement 
the national aeronautics and space administration said a new 
power unit was expected to arrive at kennedy space center this 
week shuttle managers estimate it will take two to three days to 
replace the unit said nasa spokesman bruce buckingham 
it will be the first time nasa has ever replaced an auxiliary 
power unit on the launch pad 
nasa shipped the units 15pound controller which controls 
speed back to the manufacturer for testing the manufacturer 
informed nasa the controller was fine indicating an unknown 
problem elsewhere in the unit 
auxiliary power units steer the ships three main engines 
control the movements of flaps on the wings and the rudder lower 
the main and nose landing gears and provide the hydraulics for the 
main landing gear brakes 
nasa will remove the telescopes nickelhydrogen batteries and 
recharge them in a laboratory starting saturday the batteries will 
power hubble from the time it is disconnected from the shuttles 
power system during deployment until its energycollecting solar 
panels are unfurled 
this allows the batteries to be serviced under the most 
favorable conditions while hst remains in the clean environment of 
the cargo bay nasa said referring to the telescope 
empty insect traps were removed thursday from a payload 
preparation room of the launch pad tower the traps were set up 
wednesday to catch mosquitolike midges which invaded the 
preparation room two weeks ago and delayed the telescopes 
installation in the orbiter 
the telescopes 94inch mirror the finest ever made is 
extremely sensitive to any kind of debris 
nasa had feared the midges may have invaded a payload 
preparation room at the launch pad tower again traps were set up 
but no bugs were caught and the traps were removed thursday 
hubbles installation in the orbiter was delayed two weeks ago 
after severaldozen midges got into the preparation room 
discoverys five astronauts will place hubble in space on the 
second day of the fiveday mission delayed since 1983 by technical 
problems and the 1986 challenger explosion the telescope is to 
orbit 380 miles high for 15 years enabling astronomers to look 
back to almost the beginning of time

drug testing in rhode island showed that 75 
percent of 465 women had used cocaine marijuana speed or opiates 
two days before giving birth federal health officials said 
thursday 
while rhode island is an urban state and perhaps more prone to 
drug use than more rural ones the report probably has 
underestimated illicit drug use among women giving birth the us 
centers for disease control said 
its probably important for any state to keep in mind the 
same thing we discovered said dr william hollinshead of the 
rhode island division of family health 
there are almost always a number of different substances being 
used by pregnant women probably much more commonly than we 
realize and this doesnt even touch on our old standard poisons of 
alcohol and tobacco 
the testing was performed on urine samples from 465 women in 
labor at eight hospitals across the state in october and november 
the women were not informed the program was taking place and only 
samples headed for discarding were analyzed hollinshead said 
demographic data about the patients were recorded but names were 
not used 
thirtyfive samples or 75 percent tested positive for drugs 
cocaine was detected in 26 percent marijuana was detected in 3 
percent opiates were detected in 17 percent and amphetamines were 
detected in 02 percent according to program results reported 
thursday by the atlantabased cdc 
drug use rates were higher among nonwhites than whites 102 
percent to 7 percent rates were also higher among women under age 
25 than older women 91 percent to 7 percent rates were lower 
among women having their first child 57 percent compared with 
92 percent for women having their second or more 
hollinshead said he would be hesitant to project rhode island 
statistics to other states in part because urban and coastal areas 
tend to have higher incidence of drug use than more rural areas 
still the cdcs report noted these rates are probably 
underestimated because they reflect drug use only within 48 
hours of labor and delivery and because only a limited number of 
drugs were assessed

the united states is moving to quickly 
normalize relations with chiles new democratic government the 
state department said thursday 
this could include the lifting of economic sanctions and the end 
of restrictions on military aid and arms sales 
the united states applauds the return to democracy in chile 
the state department said in a statement we hope to normalize 
quickly all of our relations with the new government in chile 
including economic political and defense relations 
the departments statement comes one month after the 
inauguration of president patricio aylwin to replace dictator gen 
augusto pinochet 
pinochet ruled chile with an iron hand after the coup that 
ousted socialist president salvador allende gossens in september 
1973 thousands of allendes supporters were rounded up and many 
were tortured or killed 
pinochet remains head of the chilean armed forces 
but vice president dan quayle who attended aylwins march 11 
inauguration in santiago said pinochet assured him he would follow 
the policies of the new civilian government 
the state department said a review will open soon on chiles 
petition for the restoration of easier tariff treatment of its 
exports and its request for renewed participation in the programs 
of the overseas private investment corp 
chile was suspended from participation in these programs in 1987 
due to workers rights issues the department said 
organized labor in chile now strongly supports the ending of the 
sanctions the department said 
military aid and arms sales to chile have been restricted since 
1976 the department noted us law bars their restoration until 
the chilean government meets these two conditions 
restores respect for human rights 
cooperates with the united states in bringing to justice those 
chilean intelligence officials suspected of complicity in the 1976 
murders in washington of former chilean diplomat orlando letelier 
and an american colleague ronni k moffitt 
we are confident that the new government of patricio aylwin 
will make every effort to meet those conditions the department 
statement said

critics have attacked higher education 
more savagely during the past 10 years than at any time in my 
memory the president of harvard university charged thursday 
in his 19th annual report derek bok warns that the current 
trend toward assailing the state of us education threatens to 
weaken the system even more 
most of the charges are flawed because they ignore basic 
conflicts and contradictions in the demands society makes on 
universities bok wrote 
continued criticism of this kind threatens to do needless 
damage to the public confidence so important to maintaining a 
strong system of colleges and universities 
bok blames the swelling federal deficit and tax cuts of the 
1980s for the decline in higher education and the tendency to bash 
it 
the political climate of the 1980s gave prominence to public 
figures and intellectuals of a conservative bent who saw 
universities as liberal strongholds populated by cocksure 
opinionated professors bok wrote 
while criticism is always a valid outlet for opinion and change 
bok believes the attacks on higher education have been unfounded or 
made without all the facts 
what is needed is not an end to criticism but a criticism 
that is less given to rhetorical excess more careful with its 
criteria for judgment bok wrote 
bok addressed several controversial issues including the 
conflict between teaching and research increasing tuition costs 
curriculum quality and calls from the public to curtail university 
spending 
the teachingversusresearch debate has been especially heated 
at harvard last month the faculty of harvard medical school 
approved a set of guidelines governing outside work for faculty 
members 
one signal comes from all the critics who deplore the neglect 
of teaching and the stress that universities place on published 
work bok said the other makes the opposite point through a 
system of powerful incentives and rewards that offers fame fortune 
and ample funding to successful scientists and scholars 
bok said that teachers are not always motivated by private gain 
when undertaking outside pursuits and that research usually 
benefits a university but he said that schools need to delineate 
how much time can be spent on outside pursuits and that 
restrictions are inadequate at many institutions 
bok also decried what he called hostile publicity about 
rising tuition costs he most news reports about expensive tuition 
are focused on a few highpowered universities such as harvard 
stanford yale or princeton when in fact the majority of 
undergraduates attend public universities where tuition is less 
than 2000 per year

east germanys parliament chose lothar de 
maiziere as prime minister on thursday and embraced his sweeping 
agenda for quickly uniting the foundering nation with west germany 
the former communist nations first freely elected legislature 
also apologized to jews for nazi atrocities and promised to make 
reparations to israel and seek diplomatic ties 
by putting de maizieres broad coalition government in power 
the parliament sets up a transitional government whose prime goal 
will be to negotiate the terms of creating a single germany 
before parliament met members of the coalition agreed that a 
united germany should remain part of nato and that east germany 
should merge its weak currency with west germanys strong 
deutschmark by july 1 
the coalition also backed a rapid process for unification 
however it demanded too that east germans retain some social 
benefits including housing and job guarantees as the nation of 16 
million residents sheds four decades of socialism for the 
competitive free market 
the historic decisions on thursday will be followed in the 
coming weeks by unification talks with west germany and the four 
world war ii allies that divided the countries the soviet union 
united states britain and france 
de maiziere closely aligned to helmut kohl appeared to 
distance himself from the west german chancellor after the 
parliamentary session 
he said final unification may not come late next year as kohl 
has said it can be realistic but it doesnt have to be 
realistic he said of kohls prediction 
de maiziere said merging the nations will depend less on timing 
than on the conditions he said on west germanys zdf television 
network that we must create compatible structures 
the 400member parliament put de maiziere and his 24member 
cabinet in power by a vote of 265108 with nine abstentions 
eighteen lawmakers were absent 
with the vote the new government replaces the communist 
caretaker government that has been running the economically 
troubled country since east germans overthrew the hardline regime 
of erich honecker in october 
in a remarkable string of conciliatory gestures the parliament 
recognized the legitimacy of polands postwar borders which 
include former german lands and apologized for east germanys role 
in the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 
it apologized for the deaths of 20 million soviets during world 
war ii and ended four decades of denials that east germanys 
former stalinist leaders played any role in the deaths of 6 million 
jews 
persecuted jews should be granted asylum in the future in east 
germany the parliament declaration said 
israel has long demanded reparations and an east german apology 
for nazi crimes as a condition for diplomatic relations 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said that at first glance it looks like a positive 
announcement 
but parliament speaker dov shilansky a survivor of the dachau 
concentration camp said he would never grant forgiveness for the 
killing of 6 million jews during world war ii 
de maiziere a bearded 50yearold lawyer whose conservative 
coalition won in the nations first free elections on march 18 
rose to power by promising western prosperity through quick 
unification 
his compromises with the leftleaning social democrats who 
finished second in the elections and agreed to join his government 
indicates east germany will demand some sort of social safety net 
for its citizens when it negotiates with west germany 
the coalition accord calls for a retention of current 
unemployment benefits retirement insurance and aid to the 
disadvantaged it calls for east germans to be guaranteed a place 
to live and for rent increases to be tied to wages 
the accord on terms of reunification contained several 
compromises that could put de maiziere at odds with his mentor 
west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the accord calls for a 11 conversion of east german marks for 
west german marks when the nations merge their currencies 
west germanys central bank has proposed a 21 rate for all but 
small savings accounts 
the coalition agreement follows kohls demand that a united 
germany be part of nato 
the agreement said it can be assumed that a unified germany 
during a transition period and until the creation of a collective 
european security system should be a member of a nato that itself 
is transforming its military functions 
the soviet union wants a new germany to be neutral west germany 
now is in nato and east germany is part of the sovietled warsaw 
pact 
the strategic future of a unified germany will be the main 
negotiating point when the superpowers take part in the unification 
talks perhaps next month 
the coalition agreement also said the merger of the two 
countries should be based on a west german constitutional provision 
that permits direct incorporation of east german territory into 
west germany 
the social democrats had demanded a more gradual system of 
unification with east german states voting separately on 
unification 
kohl and de maiziere both favor the faster process 
kohl congratulated de maiziere on his election and offered 
close and friendly cooperation in bringing together the german 
states after decades of forced separation 
although de maizieres conservative alliance finished first in 
the elections he formed a coalition with the social democrats to 
get the twothirds majority in parliament needed to win 
constitutional changes needed for unification 
the coalition has proven politically expedient as east germans 
first enamored of the idea of quick western prosperity now are 
beginning to fear the loss of their subsidizied homes jobs and 
food

a judges decision to give legal 
protection to seven frozen human embryos went far beyond his 
authority and should be overturned a lawyer said in an appeal 
filed thursday 
the ruling was made last september in the divorce case of junior 
lewis davis and mary sue davis the only issue was what to do with 
the eggs that resulted from invitro fertilization in december 1988 
mrs davis testified that she wanted control of the embryos in 
an attempt to have children davis said he did not want the embryos 
used in any fashion without his consent especially by his exwife 
blount county circuit court judge dale young last september 
ruled that life begins at conception and accorded the embryos 
the same legal status as children would have in a custody dispute 
between their parents 
he granted temporary custody to mrs davis who has since 
remarried but continued an order preventing her from using them 
while appeals are pending 
the appeal filed by junior lewis davis said the judges decision 
was inconsistent with existing laws 
fortyeighthour fertilized embryos kept frozen will enjoy 
enhanced protection while first trimester fetuses will continue to 
be legally aborted the appeal said 
the ruling elevates these tenuous and as yet undeveloped 
laboratory embryos to a legal status that exceeds any in federal 
constitutional law or the tennessee criminal abortion or probate 
laws according to the appeal 
the appeal says young erred by attempting to set a policy which 
is supposed to be reserved for the legislature moreover the 
appeal says the decision does an injustice to the rights of davis 
to avoid becoming a parent 
attorneys for mrs davis who is remarried and living in 
florida have 30 days to respond to the appeal

the bush administration will call for broader 
research into the economic effects of global warming but propose no 
timetable for dealing with the the issue at upcoming international 
talks senior officials said thursday 
the twoday conference will bring together ministers from 17 
countries as well as the european community for a discussion of the 
economic impact of global warming and what additional scientific 
data is needed 
we want to raise the level of debate on the science and 
economics of global change michael boskin chairman of the 
presidents council of economic advisers told a white house 
briefing 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
said the conference is not about targets and timetables but 
aimed at forming priorities for further research and evaluating 
the economic problems posed by the warming of the earth 
president bush in february called for the white house conference 
and invited senior ministers to attend the top economic 
environmental and scientific advisers to the heads of state of the 
17 countries will participate in the conference which begins 
tuesday 
with the conference focusing on more research environmentalists 
have renewed criticism of the bush administration they urge a more 
active response to concerns that the globe will become 
significantly warmer by the middle of the next century because of 
manmade pollution 
theyre just saying no again to taking any steps to deal with 
global warming said daniel becker of the sierra club 
bush had steadfastly maintained that not enough is known about 
the severity of the problem to warrant dramatic moves to reduce the 
emissions that are causing the earth to become warmer 
some european countries have argued for a stabelization of 
carbon dioxide emissions primarily from the burning of fossil 
fuels by the year 2000 
many environmentalists have said such emissions should be cut by 
as much as onefifth by the turn of the century if significant 
warming is to be averted 
the adminstration has argued that such moves which would 
require a dramatic shift toward energy conservation and away from 
the burning of fossil fuels could have severe economic 
repercussions and should not be imposed until more is known about 
the socalled greenhouse problem 
allan bromley the presidents science adviser who has been 
among those advocating the goslow approach said thursday that the 
united states plans to push during the upcoming meeting for 
agreement among the participants to expand international research 
on both the science of global warming and the economic implications 
both reilly anbd bromley maintained that some who advocate 
stabelization of carbon dioxide emissions have not examined 
sufficiently the economic consequences of such a move

a british companys american subsidiary and 
one of its divisions agreed to pay 395 million to settle charges 
that the division overbilled the defense department the justice 
department announced thursday 
the false claims for electric devices made for military aircraft 
flight control and fuel management systems were submitted from 1983 
through 1986 the department said 
the settlement was with the american subsidiary of smiths 
industries of great britain and one of its divisions sli avionic 
systems division grand rapids mich 
the false claims were submitted by the instruments division of 
lear siegler inc slis forerunner and it reported the mischarges 
to the pentagon in december 1986 the justice department said sli 
continued to provide information to the government after it took 
over lear sieger 
the division overbilled the government when it shifted costs 
between accounts that were established for a specific project and 
accounts for general research and development the department said 
this settlement represents precisely the type of voluntary 
cooperation that we encourage among all the contractors who 
discover billing irregularities stuart m gerson assistant 
attorney general in charge of the civil division said in a 
statement 
the false claims act allows for civil damages to be reduced from 
three to two times the governments loss when the company reports

patients have the right to refuse lifesustaining 
medical treatment but active euthanasia is wrong said a report 
released thursday nearly a year after a gunwielding father 
disconnected his comatose babys life support 
the time has come to return control over the dying process to 
patients and their families said the report 
the report was written by a task force formed by cook county 
states attorney cecil partee after the april 26 incident at 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center 
rudy linares holding hospital workers at bay with a gun turned 
off his 15monthold sons respirator and cradled the baby in his 
arms until he died 
officials at the hospital had refused family requests to halt 
life support 
a grand jury refused to charge linares with murder he pleaded 
guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unlawful possession of a weapon 
and was ordered to seek psychological counseling 
the report should have been done long before so this wouldnt 
have occurred linares said in a telephone interview thursday 
adding that he had no regrets over his actions 
illinois law allows people to decline life support through 
living wills or by assigning power of attorney to a third party 
model legislation drafted by the task force would allow people to 
refuse life support without taking such actions 
partee wrote legislation similar to the model bill it was 
introduced last week in the illinois senate 
the task force said a person should be judged capable of making 
the decision to end life support before medical officials take such 
action the task force said surrogates could make the decision for 
those judged not capable and that parents could decide for children 
a judicial ruling would be needed only in cases of a dispute 
the task force said noting that doctors and surrogates should be 
immune from criminal prosecution for decisions made in good faith 
the task force said its report was in no way intended to 
endorse the practice of active euthanasia or mercy killing 
at the time the task force was formed there were no state court 
rulings on the issue earlier this year the illinois supreme court 
ruled that life support could be withheld from terminally ill 
patients when they are diagnosed as irreversibly comatose and when 
a doctors diagnosis was confirmed by two other physicians 
the task forces work was praised by fenella rouse director of 
the new yorkbased concern for dying and the society for the right 
to die 
you dont want to have outsiders who have never been involved 
in the persons life making the decision for them she said 
linares dilemma began after his infant son sam swallowed a 
balloon in august 1988 blocking his air passage paramedics failed 
to revive sam and he never regained consciousness 
when hospital personnel refused family requests to withdraw life 
support linares said he decided to take things into his own hands 
although he escaped prosecution and prison linares was fired 
from his job as a painter about a week after his son died he was 
hospitalized for taking a mixture of cocaine and the drug pcp he 
later pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge 
the pressure and the realization that i wasnt going to go to 
jail after all got to me linares said i felt like the drugs 
were a way out 
hired as a forklift driver in september linares was fired the 
day after he started when management learned of his past 
linares has a new job fixing machines at an assembly plant and 
attends alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous meetings 
i had two other kids and a goodlooking wife he said i 
thought if i fold under now if i got too depressed what will 
happen to them

this was supposed to be a day of rest for 
pulitzer prizewinner oscar hijuelos 
staying at a friends house in the country the author had spent 
the morning shopping for antiques and browsing in bookstores and 
was looking forward to getting some reading done in the afternoon 
then the phone rang it was roger straus president of farrar 
straus amp giroux which published hijuelos novel the mambo kings 
play songs of love 
he doesnt call you very often but when he does its good 
news hijuelos said in a telephone interview from ulster county 
the news couldnt have been better mambo kings had won the 
pulitzer prize for fiction 
this is so unexpected said hijuelos the son of cuban 
immigrants and a resident of manhattan ive just been in england 
and i was spending the week here to chill out i didnt even know 
when they were going to announce this thing my mother will be 
happy 
mambo kings cesar and nestor castillo would have understood 
theyre the cuban brothers who immigrated to the united states and 
through their friendship with desi arnaz wound up on stage at the 
tropicana and in the living room of ricky and lucy ricardo in 
hijuelos own special episode of i love lucy 
it really started out as a novel about a superintendent who 
had a past life hijuelos said of his second novel his past 
life was about music and then the music took over it ties into my 
cuban roots and also into my interest in the culture in general 
you always get that second novelitis said hijuelos whose 
first novel our house in the last world was published in 
1985 so what happened was simply amazing to me 
hijuelos born in new york in 1951 originally wanted to be a 
rock n roll star but was turned off by the drug scene he nearly 
quit writing as well attending a conference in 1978 and finding it 
the most sexist hierarchal opinionated prejudical place ive 
ever been on earth 
fortunately hijuelos became friendly with author donald 
barthelme who encouraged the young writer to develop his own style 
and even offered tips on the secrets of success 
he said if youre good you eventually get recognized sooner 
or later hijuelos said of barthelme who died of cancer last 
year 
i figured i had 20 years to go to get these kinds of breaks 
he always spoke about awards as an important kind of thing i think 
its a way for writers investing into their future it helps 
people it helps writers and the readers they identify with 
hijuelos gets letters from people all over the country telling 
him they can relate to the experiences of the castillo brothers and 
expressing curiosity about the world he evokes 
the united states is a country of immigrants and i think 
people who are still in touch with feelings of displacement could 
tap into the characters in the novel he said 
i guess on another level people are tired of the a fits into 
b kind of formulaic novels i wanted to do something different i 
tried to structure the book musically i also hope it means that 
people feel differently about the kind of people i wrote about 
hijuelos working on a new novel tentatively titled 14 
sisters says winning the pulitzer is just the tip of the 
iceberg for him and so many others ready to tell their stories 
i think culturally the establishment has in homegrown 
latin writers a potential source of great literature most writing 
from minorities is on small presses and university presses 
maybe this will encourage publishers to move over a little bit

combustible materials were left in 
the passageways of a ferry before it caught fire and the vessel was 
in such poor shape that it should never have left port the ships 
secondincommand said thursday 
karsten hansen staff captain of the scandinavian star made his 
comments before a maritime commission investigating the blaze 
saturday on the 10500ton ferry which was sailing from norway to 
denmark 
on thursday norwegian police lowered their estimate to 166 
people killed in the disaster they earlier estimated the toll at 
168 but police have said they have no final figure 
police said they believe the fire was deliberate the danish 
shipowner vr dano posted a 39000 reward for information 
leading to the identity of the arsonist 
in larvik norway police said thursday that 1639 passengers 
and 130 crew members were evacuated from a norwegian ferry 
following a bomb threat the ferry peter wessel which had left 90 
minutes earlier for denmark returned to the norwegian port 
wednesday night after the threat which proved false said police 
inspector paal aartun 
hansen told the maritime inquiry that inflammable refuse was 
left in corridors while the the ship underwent renovations 
work was going on all over the ship he said carpenters and 
painters were finishing renovations of cabins the bar and other 
areas of the ship which the new danish owner took over march 30 
service personnel often left bundles of bedding outside the 
passenger cabins they cleaned creating a fire hazard he said 
the authorities should never have allowed that ship to leave 
port hansen said 
hansen said some of the catering staff complained of exhaustion 
from overwork he added that hed heard of friction between crew 
members 
rescued passengers complained that the crew mostly filipino and 
portuguese sailors appeared untrained to handle a crisis and could 
not communicate with passengers a fire inspector testified earlier 
that serious faults were found with firecontaining devices and 
fire fighting equipment was unused 
according to the ships emergency roster hansen was the ships 
fire chief and was responsible for organizing the crew in an 
emergency 
but during questioning hansen said he was unaware of the 
regulation and added he wasnt hired in that capacity 
hansen said he and another crewman donned fire suits to rescue 
trapped passengers the two rescued three unconscious passengers 
before being taken off the stricken ship by rescue helicopters 
hansen said at one point during a search below decks he found a 
dead woman clutching an infant also dead to her breast 
the norwegian captain of the vessel hugo larsen denied in 
testimony wednesday the safety devices were faulty but admitted 
the crew had not undergone a fire drill which had been scheduled 
for the day after the fire 
eighty of the 97 crewmen had been hired within the week before 
the disaster according to witnesses who appeared at the inquiry

august wilson says the piano lesson winner 
of the 1990 pulitzer prize for drama was a a joyful play to 
write 
i wrote the play in several months and when it went around 
the country for two years i continued to work on it said the 
man who won his first pulitzer three years ago for fences 
wilson said the idea for the piano lesson which opens 
monday at broadways walter kerr theater came to him from a 
painting by black artist romare bearden the painters work 
inspired another wilson play joe turners come and gone 
bearden is a tremendous artist and i always wanted to make my 
plays worthy of his canvasses wilson said i would be doing a 
good thing if i could make them as rich and as full as the life he 
expressed in his paintings 
the playwright was taken by a bearden painting of a young girl 
sitting at a piano with her teacher standing over her from it he 
fashioned a family drama of a brother and a sister in pittsburgh in 
1936 the brother wants to buy the land his grandfather worked on 
as a slave and is willing to sell the family heirloom a piano to 
pay for it the sister wants to keep it 
wilson says he was haunted by the question can you acquire a 
sense of selfworth by denying your past 
nd when i began to work on the play it began to take on a 
larger question what do you do with your legacy and how do you 
put it to work for you 
the piano lesson is a better play for having had the 
opportunity to tour for so long before coming to new york the 
playwright said 
when it started i never said what happened to the piano 
the playwright said and i found that the audiences wanted to 
know now i do answer the question i found i did not want to make 
a choice but i discovered the choice was built into the play 
wilson was in a manhattan hotel giving an interview when he 
learned he had won the pulitzer 
i was very surprised he said i wasnt expecting it i 
thought wow this is no 2 it made me want to go right to my 
typewriter and start another one 
the piano lesson is part of a cycle of plays about black 
american life during the decades of this century its also the 
fourth collaboration between wilson and director lloyd richards 
who also directed fences 
their relationship started with ma raineys black bottom 
which opened on broadway in 1984 it was followed to new york by 
fences in 1987 and joe turners come and gone in 1988 
wilsons newest play two trains running recently opened at 
the yale repertory theater in new haven conn and eventually is 
expected to make its way to broadway 
when he returns to his home in st paul minn after the 
opening of the piano lesson wilson said he would begin work on 
moon going down set in the 1940s 
wilson is the first playwright since edward albee to win two 
pulitzer prizes for drama other twotime winners include robert 
sherwood george s kaufman and tennessee williams eugene oneill 
won four pulitzers including a posthumous award in 1957 for long 
days journey into night

its not uncommon for foreign 
correspondents to move to washington after their tours abroad but 
its usually washington dc not nc 
bill coughlin did it a little differently much to his delight 
thursday when the washington daily news won a pulitzer prize for 
public service journalism 
i feel its a little ironic after having worked in moscow and 
vietnam and beirut to find my pulitzer in a little town on the 
pamlico in north carolina said coughlin 67 a former foreign 
correspondent for the los angeles times who was hired as executive 
editor of the daily news a year ago 
it says if you set your standards high enough you can be just 
as good as big town newspapers 
the daily news whose circulation is 10700 won the award for 
breaking town officials long silence about the cancercausing 
chemicals tainting the drinking water the announcement brought 
whoops hollers marching music and champagne into the newsroom of 
the eastern north carolina paper 
this is quite a moment coughlin said i will say we 
havent had this much excitement in this town since the union 
cavalry and the confederate cavalry chased each other up main 
street in 1862 and theres been nothing like that since 
daily news reporters betty gray and mike voss who wrote the 
series about the towns contaminated water supply and the failure 
of town officials to notify the 9000 residents said the award 
made their efforts worthwhile 
all through covering the story there was a great deal of 
pressure said ms gray 36 im a native of washington i grew 
up with the people that were running the city it was all 
worthwhile anyway 
the afternoon newspaper published by former state sen ashley 
futrell sr 78 and his son ashley jr has won statewide awards 
the paper averages 16 pages and is written and edited in three 
rooms 
it shows smalltown newspapers that they have just as good a 
chance as anybody else voss said 
it all started when coughlin was at city hall paying his water 
bill last summer he noticed a message on the back of the bill 
saying the water was being tested for a variety of chemicals he 
suggested that ms gray a former insurance agent with three years 
journalism experience look into it 
in september when the newspaper first reported that the 
drinking water contained nine times the safe level of 
trihalomethanes which are known to cause cancer town officials 
said ms grays article exaggerated the danger 
but 10 days after the stories began state officials told 
residents to stop drinking water from the pamlico river the marine 
corps set up 24houraday water wagons 
a second chemical even more deadly was found by state 
officials who warned that the risk of cancer for lifelong water 
drinkers could be 1 in 250 
a month later state officials found similar contaminants 
exceeding federal standards in 13 other small communities 
voss 35 said he joined ms gray on the series when we saw 
what we had 
im ecstatic he said this is a dream come true its the 
pinnacle of the profession for a small town newspaper to compete 
and take home the biggest and the best is unbelieveable 
the twomonth water ban was lifted after the city began spending 
14000 per month on a temporary treatment system using chemicals 
besides chlorine the water now meets federal standards and state 
officials are working with the other towns to clean up their water 
state health director ron levine credits the daily news with the 
regulatory changes that perhaps saved hundreds of lives 
some town officials disagree with the honor and remain bitter 
about the stories that divided this quiet waterfront town as part 
of their stories ms gray and voss reported that town officials 
had known about the problem for eight years and hadnt told anyone 
washingtons elected officials have since been voted out

apollo astronauts wally schirra and 
buzz aldrin lent their support thursday to a museum auction that 
aviation buffs hope will do for old airplanes what sothebys does 
for rembrandts and van goghs 
these planes are works of art in their own right said 
donald douglas jr whose father built the dc3 and countless other 
planes made famous in war and peace we hope this auction does 
very well by them 
the auction will be held may 19 and 20 at the grounds of the 
museum of flying located where douglas sr once ran his aircraft 
works 
aircraft offered for sale include classic war birds of world 
war ii vintage spitfires that gained fame in the battle of 
britain and p51 mustangs that escorted american bombers to targets 
over nazi germany 
bidding on a p38 twinboom lightning fighter built by lockheed 
begins at 11 million in the auction catalog 
a reproduction of a bright red fokker of the type flown by the

five us senators urged president saddam 
hussein of iraq on thursday to halt efforts to develop nuclear 
chemical and biological weapons which they said created 
dangerous tensions in the middle east 
senate republican leader bob dole said saddam was seriously 
worried that israel planned to launch a preemptive strike similar 
to the one in june 1981 when israeli warplanes bombed an iraqi 
nuclear reactor 
they still remember the 1981 israeli strike and i think there 
is some fear that that might recur dole told reporters after 
arriving from iraq 
his delegation met with saddam in the iraqi city of mosul for 2 
hours the others in the us delegation were james mcclure 
ridaho alan simpson rwyoming frank murkowski ralaska and 
howrd metzenbaum dohio 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel called for international 
pressure on iraq to end such weapon programs and he declared that 
israel would use all the necessary means if attacked 
western fears over iraqs arms programs have grown in recent 
weeks and british officials said thursday they had seized an 
iraqibound gun that would be capable of launching nuclear or 
chemical warheads hundreds of miles 
dole said saddam was upset by negative press reports about iraq 
including british revelations two weeks ago that baghdad had tried 
to acquire usmade triggering devices for nuclear weapons 
i think saddam hussein believes there is this capability by 
america the british and israel to tarnish the image of his country 
and to send out false statements dole said 
in a letter to the iraqi president the us senators said 
iraqs arms programs are creating dangerous tensions in the 
middle east 
dole said saddam denied either possessing or developing nuclear 
weapons and insisted he was not trying to make a biological weapon 
however nbc news quoted intelligence reports saying iraq had 
developed germ warfare in research at the salman pak facility south 
of baghdad israeli sources said iraq was trying to make a weapon 
that could spread anthrax typhoid and cholera but lacked the 
technology to package it in a missile warhead 
speaking to reporters earlier shamir called for international 
support in eliminating the threat posed by iraqs reported chemical 
and biological warfare capabilities 
shamir speaking at a park near jerusalem said in view of 
improving peace prospects in many parts of the world it is very 
disagreeable and frightening to hear such voices coming from iraq 
these threats have to be eliminated by the pressure of the 
whole international community shamir said in response to a 
question 
simpson said saddam had made it clear to the us delegation 
that he would launch a fullscale retaliatory strike against 
israel using chemical weapons if israel struck first with nuclear 
weapons

police fired tear gas thursday to end a 
christian protest over a jewish settlement and fought palestinian 
stonethrowers as foreign tourists visiting the city for easter 
tried to avoid the violence 
the street battles with young arabs occurred in jerusalems old 
city near the church of the holy sepulcher as thousands of tourists 
were visiting this biblical setting for easter celebrations 
the protest by christian clerics focused on a nearby settlement 
of 150 jews in the arab christian quarter the jerusalem 
magistrates court responding to a lawsuit by the greek orthodox 
church ruled late thursday the settlers must leave 
however a spokesman for the settlers david benami said they 
would appeal and police agreed for now not to expel them 
also thursday the palestinian alhaqlaw in the service of man 
human rights group said a palestine activist killed last week by 
soldiers in the west bank was shot in the back of the head without 
provocation 
the group said the death of mustafa ali tal shrakeh from the 
west banks jalazoun refugee camp was the 19th case in which it 
suspected israeli forces of carrying out a willful killing 
during the 28monthold uprising 
the army said the youth was killed when soldiers opened fire 
with rubberbullets on stonethrowers the army has repeatedly 
denied it intentionally shoots palestinians 
throughout the occupied territories thursday 10 palestinians 
were wounded in stonethrowing clashes with troops arab reports 
said 
the army confirmed one of the wounded and said it was 
investigating the other incidents 
at least 673 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
and civilians during the uprising and 206 palestinians have been 
killed by fellow arabs most as suspected collaborators with 
israel fortythree israelis have also died in the violence 
the founding of the new settlement during easter week 
particularly angered the palestinian christian community which 
perceives it as a threat to their small neighborhood within the 
walled city 
the new jewish enclave also set off a dispute between jerusalem 
mayor teddy kollek and the israeli government 
there is no question that the timing of their move lacks 
wisdom and sensitivity kollek said in a statement 
thursdays clash in the old city began when police fired tear 
gas and pushed about 200 demonstrating clerics and supporters away 
from the jewish settlement 
witnesses said police charged after a priest tore down a poster 
picturing an israeli star of david that had been pasted over a 
cross on the door 
greek orthodox patriarch diodorus i was overcome by the gas and 
collapsed witnesses said several other clerics were also sickened 
by gas the witnesses said 
later thursday arab youths raised an outlawed palestinian flag 
on the roof of the church of the holy sepulcher and police chased 
after the youths to the greek orthodox patriarchate 
witnesses said stonethrowing broke out and police fired tear 
gas and rubber bullets filling the building with gas and breaking 
windows 
the standoff ended when kollek who came to the patriarchate to 
extend easter greetings intervened with police 
tourists wandered through the narrow streets of the city seemed 
bewildered wondering which way to go to avoid trouble 
kollek criticized the israeli government for not intervening 
saying the dispute has international repercussions 
but yossi achimeir spokesman for prime minister yizhak shamir 
said arab christians were being unreasonable 
jews are entitled to live everywhere especially in our 
eternal capital achimeir told the associated press 
shamirs government has consistently championed the right of 
jews to settle anywhere in jerusalem including the old city and 
arab east jerusalem which were captured from jordan in the 1967 
war and annexed 
president bush last month raised a controversy in israel by 
repeating that us policy considers the arab sector of jerusalem 
to be disputed land 
jerusalems old city divided into ethnic quarters is home to 
50000 moslems about 7000 christians and 4000 jews 
the latest religious dispute began wednesday when ultraorthodox 
jewish families moved into the fourbuilding complex in the heart 
of the christian neighborhood 
the group that set up the enclave of naot david hebrew for 
dwellings of david says it bought the building from a christian 
in its suit the greek orthodox church says it owns the 72room 
complex where the jews moved in under police guard the church says 
the four buildings were sold illegally by a former tenant 
benami said the group was trying to reestablish the jewish 
community that was driven from the area by arab riots in 1936

a judge ruled thursday that a woman was insane 
when she tried to kill a man in what was portrayed as a ritual 
honoring jack the ripper 
deborah kazuck 27 was ordered sent to a psychiatric hospital 
by circuit judge william d gardner after he found her innocent by 
reason of insanity of attempted firstdegree intentional homicide 
a jury earlier thursday convicted her of the charge the judge 
decided whether she should be sent to prison or a psychiatric 
hospital 
i honestly feel the judge did the right thing here defense 
attorney alan a olshan said adding he didnt think ms kazuck 
understood either decision in the trial 
her mother marilyn kazuck left the courtroom crying after the 
jurys verdict telling a reporter her daughter was upset and 
suffered from psychological problems that needed attention 
if i was crying she was probably crying too mrs kazuck 
said she needs help now most of all she needs help what they 
have done to her oh 
mrs kazuck said she believed her daughter was the victim of an 
unfair police investigation shes innocent completely she got a 
raw deal all the way around 
deborah kazuck testified wednesday she never plotted the may 29 
attack and only struck the man with the ax when he tried to 
sexually assault her 
but two codefendants ramona barry and catherine lipsham 
testified ms kazuck had asked them to lure the victim jeffrey 
meka 27 to an apartment where they planned to kill him 
ms barry and ms lipsham who pleaded guilty to attempted 
murder last week under a plea bargain said they and ms kazuck 
regularly looked for victims to kack their code word for 
killing 
prosecutors told jurors ms kazuck sprang from behind a shower 
curtain and slugged the man in the head with a hatchet intending 
to kill him 
prosecutors alleged ms kazuck planned to dismember mekas body 
drain his blood and eat his kidneys in a ritual she believed would 
resurrect jack the ripper the 19th century british serial killer 
meka testified ms kazuck was chanting redrum or 
murder backwards when she lurched at him with the ax the 
blow he said opened a gash over his eye that required 50 stitches 
ms kazuck disputed those claims but admitted she was 
fascinated with jack the ripper and regularly carried a backpack 
containing a hatchet a drill and knives 
during the second phase of the trial a defense psychiatrist 
testified ms kazuck suffered from a mental disease and could not 
understand her acts were wrong a state psychiatrist said she 
suffered from a personality disorder but could be held responsible 
for the crime

the environmental group greenpeace on thursday 
accused a british company of contaminating drinking and bathing 
water in south africas kwazulu homeland by improperly reprocessing 
mercury wastes 
the company thor chemical denied it contaminated a river that 
provides the drinking supply for the kwazulu homeland or exposed 
workers to poisonous fumes 
thor chemicals mercury reclamation plant the worlds largest 
receives wastes from companies in the united states britain 
italy west germany france and australia 
greenpeace said american cyanamid co of wayne nj is one of 
the largest users of the plant and has shipped nearly 10 tons of 
toxic waste a year to the plant the past four years 
there was no comment from american cyanamid which did not 
return repeated telephone calls 
in a statement released in london greenpeace said workers at 
the plant are regularly exposed to mercury fumes and have suffered 
a variety of mental disorders mercury attacks the central nervous 
system and can cause brain damage 
in a statement carried in the greenpeace press release the 
south african environmental group earthlife said black workers at 
thor chemicals have been sent home from the plant after suffering 
from bouts of madness associated with mercury poisoning 
bill garrard managing director of thor chemicals was quoted as 
telling the british newspaper the guardian that workers are tested 
weekly for contamination and are taken off the job if they show 
high mercury levels 
the greenpeace statement also said sediment taken from the 
nearby umgeni river showed mercury levels of 1000 parts per 
million villagers in the governmentdesignated homeland of kwazulu 
use the water for bathing washing and drinking 
this is an astonishing level of contamination among the 
highest ever recorded dr paul johnston an aquatic toxicologist 
at queen mary college in london was quoted as saying in the 
greenpeace statement 
johnston was quoted by the guardian as saying the mercury 
contamination was extensive and serious and that levels were 
hundreds of times above the world health organizations maximum 
acceptable levels for drinking water 
the kwazulu homeland in the southeastern part of south africa is 
home to 7 million blacks south africa is the only nation that 
recognizes the area as independent 
greenpeace said the toxic waste has been introduced into the 
water supply when heavy rains carry contaminated soil into the 
river 
chris priestley a spokesman for thor chemicals accused 
greenpeace of sensationalism he said if his company was 
contaminating water high mercury levels would also be present in 
drinking water in durban about 50 miles downstream 
priestley said the high levels of mercury in the soil samples 
was due to a form of gold mining called mercury leaching used in a 
nearby mine a few years ago 
he said excess mercury seaped into the river from the abandoned 
mine and contaminated the nearby zulu areas but not durban which 
is too far downstream for the contamination to affect 
i have no evidence that leads me to believe that any 
contamination that is arising is coming from thor chemicals itself 
we must now investigate and find out why this is happening 
priestley said 
in the last two years the growing trade in hazardous waste has 
prompted a number of agreements on dumping in africa in december 
1989 the european community signed a waste trade ban with 68 
african caribbean and pacific states 
in may 1988 and july 1989 the organization of african unity 
adopted resolutions calling for a toxic waste import ban for africa 
south africa is banned from membership in these groups due to 
the governments practice of racial discrimination

five blacks protesting the ouster of the 
citys first black school superintendent chose to remain in jail 
thursday a day after police armed with a court order restricting 
protests arrested seven people 
theyre free to go at any time said police chief melvin 
summerlin they apparently dont want to leave 
summerlin described the situation as quiet after protesters 
rallied outside the jail wednesday night in a show of support for 
the seven people arrested earlier in the day 
two people did post bond and were released 
the protests have continued since middecember when the 
whitecontrolled school board refused to extend the contract of 
norward roussell the systems first black superintendent 
the arrests came after lauderdale county circuit judge leslie 
johnson issued an order restricting demonstrators to the sidewalk 
in front of city hall the order also prohibits demonstrators from 
encouraging car drivers to honk horns marching around the building 
and holding picnics in the lobby 
four of the protesters were arrested outside city hall at noon 
wednesday on charges of obstructing governmental operations for 
setting up chairs on the sidewalk three others were arrested later 
in the day after a scuffle involving three policemen outside a 
restaurant they were charged with disorderly conduct 
summerlin said he ordered the group outside city hall to 
disperse but was ignored 
i gave them sufficient time but it didnt appear as though 
they planned to listen or abide by the court order he said we 
had no choice but to make arrests 
the incident at the restaurant wednesday apparently was sparked 
when a driver was cited for blowing his horn about a block away 
from city hall 
police reports said the three who were arrested were to blame 
for the skirmish but a spectator eliza manuel said police chased 
the three for no apparent reason 
in addition to the arrests several black motorists were given 
tickets for blowing their car horns as they drove by city hall 
which mayor joe smitherman said were deliberate acts to test the 
injunction 
among those arrested was lawyer carlos williams 41 it was his 
second arrest during protests against the the citys 
whitecontrolled school board in february williams and three 
others were arrested when they tried to force their way into the 
mayors office during a protest

a senior legislator said thursday that up to 70 
percent of the soviet state economy could be turned over to private 
hands in radical economic reforms likely to begin next year 
but pavel bunich deputy chairman of a supreme soviet committee 
on economic reform was unsure whether the government would be bold 
enough to press that hard for such largescale reforms 
if we want to take small steps we will get nowhere but to a 
general collapse bunich told a news conference 
president mikhail s gorbachev said earlier this week that he 
will meet saturday with his presidential council and the council of 
the federation to hear the governments proposals for radical 
economic changes 
he said that reforms previously scheduled to take effect in 
199293 in a plan presented by premier nikolai i ryzhkov four 
months ago should be moved up to this year and next 
bunich predicted that opponents of such radical reform a 
fundamental change in the statebased soviet economy will 
complain loudly at the supreme soviet but he said the reforms are 
likely to be approved permitting them to go into effect in 1991 
if we are talking about denationalization about 70 percent 
of the public sector will cease to exist bunich said there 
are many people who want to buy shops workshops and small 
enterprises 
such a shift would mean not only putting business in private 
hands but freeing up prices of goods produced and sold by the 
private sector bunich said 
it also would cut drastically into the work of government 
ministries and the agencies that handle economic planning pricing 
and supply he said 
bunich told reporters that he did not favor a polishstyle 
shock therapy approach to economic reform including a sudden 
freeing of prices devaluation of the currency and rapid increases 
in unemployment 
public opposition and danger of social upheavals is the main 
danger we are facing here he said 
instead he said economists are looking at an approach closer to 
yugoslavias based on wage controls 
that approach has cut the rate of inflation drastically in 
yugoslavia this year he said prices are beginning to stabilize 
in yugoslavia we are studying the yugoslav option he said 
asked whether ryzhkovs government agrees on the need to return 
the majority of the economy to private hands bunich said 
government ministers have some exact formulas but some of them 
are so porous that its just impossible to tell whether the 
government agrees or not 
after ryzhkovs government makes its proposals to gorbachev he 
is likely to address the supreme soviet legislature at the end of 
the month with a final blueprint of economic reform that will 
require new laws and directives

a new yorkbased hasidic rabbi who has never 
been to israel emerged thursday as a pivotal figure in deciding 
whether labor party leader shimon peres will be the new prime 
minister 
a lawmaker of the agudat israel party said the ultraorthodox 
faction would appeal to brooklynbased rabbi menachem schneerson to 
change the minds of two agudat members who at the last minute 
backed out of the partys pledge to join a laborled coalition 
the two legislators avraham verdiger and eliezer mizrahi cited 
loyalty to schneersons teachings in explaining why they refused to 
vote for labor on wednesday this blocked peres from forming a new 
government 
schneerson is known as the lubavitcher rabbi and is revered by 
hundreds of thousands of hasidic jews he opposes labors proposal 
to exchange parts of the occupied west bank and gaza strip for 
peace with the palestinians 
he has written that the biblical land of israel which includes 
the occupied territories was given to the israelis by god and must 
never be surrendered 
the involvement of schneerson and other ultraorthodox religious 
leaders in israeli politics has caused concern among the countrys 
overwhelmingly secular public 
the whole political situation depends on rabbis not only the 
lubavitcher rabbi but also others moshe shahal a senior labor 
party official said on israel radio 
we are facing a new phenomenon the involvement of 
ultraorthodox streams of judaism which are taking part for the 
first time in secular politics shahal said 
berke wolff a spokesman for schneersons habad movement in 
israel denied the rabbi had persuaded the two lawmakers to defect 
but israel army radio reported that at least one of the legislators 
was instructed by schneerson to refuse to vote for peres coalition 
agudat legislator rabbi menachem porusch who negotiated the 
agreement with labor said schneerson did not give direct 
instructions to the two defectors to defy the party line 
no doubt there is a misunderstanding here he said im 
sure he schneerson would not tell verdiger and mizrahi to go 
against the wishes of the council of torah sages 
the councils rabbis are the spiritual leaders of the agudat 
israel party and had approved the partys coalition agreement with 
labor 
verdiger resigned from parliament on wednesday to avoid casting 
a vote and mizrahi said he would create his own faction and vote 
against labor with the defections labors backing in the 120seat 
parliament fell from 61 to 59 prior to the changes the agudat 
party held five seats in parliament 
in brooklyn a spokesmam for the lubavitcher hasidim rabbi 
yehuda krinsky said verdiger called the lubavitcher rabbis office 
before the passover holiday and asked if there had been any change 
in schneersons opposition to the landforpeace arrangement 
he was told no and decided on his own to oppose a labor 
government krinsky said 
it was on his own it was his own initiative krinsky said 
he said the lubavitvcher movement has not been in any of the 
political horsetrading thats going on 
israels previous laborlikud coalition government collapsed 
march 15 over the partys differences on middle east peace moves 
likuds leader yitzhak shamir refused to accept us 
compromises intended to clear the way for israelipalestinian talks 
in cairo 
he lost a vote of confidence in parliament leading to the 
governments collapse

state environmental officials on 
thursday held a federal agency and a grain elevator operator 
equally responsible for cleaning up 12755 bushels of corn heavily 
tainted by a natural cancercausing toxin 
the order from the iowa division of environmental protection 
gave the farmers home administration and the pruess elevator co of 
lowden which purchased the corn until next friday to remove it 
but a lawyer representing the fmha which sold the corn from a 
foreclosed farm at chouteau okla and knew it was tainted 
insisted the agency has no responsibility the owner of the 
elevator harlan pruess continued to decline to comment thursday 
the grain is believed to have the highest concentration of 
aflatoxin ever found in this country as much as 1600 times the 
maximum allowable limit for human consumption said dale cochran 
iowas secretary of agriculture regional officials of the us 
food and drug administration in kansas city mo also said the 
aflatoxin level is the highest theyve ever come across 
aflatoxins are cancercausing and toxic substances produced by 
certain soil fuingi 
the food and drug administration says aflatoxin concentrations 
above 20 parts per billion are unsuitable for human consumption and 
concentrations above 300 parts per billion are unsuitable for 
animal feed 
fda tests of the corn found concentrations as high as 32300 
parts per billion in one sample in its bill of sale the fmha 
disclosed that the corn contained aflatoxin concentrations greater 
than 5000 parts per billion and assigned any liability to the 
purchaser 
it shouldnt be fed to anything said gary osweiler a 
veterinary toxicologist at iowa state university 
an animal fed such tainted corn probably would become ill 
within a day or so youd probably kill animals he said 
an fmha lawyer declined to say why the agency had sold the 
grain except to say that the sale had not been banned by federal 
or state authorities 
speedy action by the iowa department of agriculture prevented 
the corn from being fed to animals or winding up in milk or meat 
products state and federal officials said 
oklahoma officials notified counterparts in iowa once tests 
disclosed the aflatoxin concentrations in the early march shipment 
and iowa inspectors were on hand to quarantine the corn when it 
arrived 
dust from the tainted corn could be a health risk but 
fortunately the corn is covered with a protective crust in part 
because of the high moisture content that also enabled the fungi to 
grow said allan stokes director of the environmental protection 
division within iowas department of natural resources 
its kind of like a scab its best not to pick on it till you 
know what to do stokes said 
the corn is quarantined piled on a concrete slab surrounded by 
concrete retaining walls next to the elevator in a sparsely 
settled area three miles outside lowden in eastern iowa stokes 
said 
iowa environmental authorities set a deadline of april 20 for 
implementing an acceptable plan to get the corn out of the state 
or remove the threat from the corn stokes said 
stokes estimated the cleanup cost at around 100000 while 
cochran has placed it as high as 15 million the grain was sold 
for 9566 
robert bird an attorney in the us department of agricultures 
office of general counsel in stillwater okla represents the fmha 
i dont see how the state of iowa could hold the fmha 
coresponsible because the fmha has no ownership interest bird 
said in a telephone interview 
he said the fda and the oklahoma department of agriculture both 
knew in advance of the intended sale and if either had told the 
fmha to destroy the corn the fmha would do it 
but he said aside from informing the fmha of the maximum 
allowable limits of aflatoxin in animal feed or for human 
consumption there was no directive banning the sale

a group closely tied to the communist party and 
the soviet government has organized an environmental movement and 
plans to transform it into a political party in the fall members 
announced thursday 
noncommunist political parties were legalized last month 
there are many local environmental or greens movements in the 
country including one in leningrad that has already registered as 
a political party 
the new group called the movement for the restoration of the 
environment and morality says it will try to unite them into a 
single political force the more radical environmentalists 
however may be unwilling to affiliate with such an established 
group 
the soviet union is severely polluted as a result of years when 
any questioning of official stands including environmental 
activism could bring a prison sentence 
three officials of the new movement said it is affiliated with a 
group of 50 soviet stateowned enterprises and scientific 
institutes that are developing environmentally sound technologies 
all three men said they were communist party members and the 
movement is modeled on the party the organizations founding was 
announced in a news conference at the foreign ministry giving it 
an official air 
the groups director soviet legislator alim i chabanov said 
the movement will have its own newspaper and broadcast programs he 
said it will propose antipollution legislation and government 
funding for nonpolluting equipment

china on thursday denounced an order by president 
bush to protect chinese students in the united states from being 
deported 
bushs executive order issued wednesday is designed to help 
the students avoid reprisals for supporting the prodemocracy 
movement crushed by chinese forces in june 
the chinese also criticized britain on thursday for its plan to 
offer citizenship to hong kong residents it reiterated that it 
considers all chinese in the british colony to be citizens of china 
china is to take over control of hong kong in 1997 but it has 
pledged to allow the capitalist system to remain there for 50 years 
and permit local autonomy 
however about 1000 hong kong residents are emigrating each 
week including many of the territorys besteducated people 
bushs order wednesday followed his veto of a congressional act 
with the same goals in november he said at the time he would 
instead issue an executive order 
however he initially put out a directive containing guidelines 
for immigration officials rather than an executive order the 
action brought a rash of published reports and congressional 
criticism 
at the end of last year the chinese government made clear its 
principal position on the administrative measures announced by the 
us government foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said at a 
weekly news briefing thursday the position of the chinese side 
on this issue is consistent and unequivocal 
in criticizing the us plan last year a foreign ministry 
spokesman said the sending of chinese personnel abroad their 
management and assignment upon return are all chinas internal 
affairs in which no foreign government or parliament has the right 
to interfere 
he added the allegation that chinese personnel studying 
abroad might be persecuted upon their return to china is utterly 
groundless 
bushs order wednesday allows chinese students to remain in the 
united states until jan 1 1994 even if their visas expire 
in the complaints about the british proposal ms li said the 
chinese government has time and again made clear its solemn stand 
against the unilateral decision of britain to change the 
nationality of some of the hong kong chinese citizens 
britain plans to give passports to 50000 hong kong residents to 
prevent a crippling brain drain in the territory before it reverts 
to chinese rule british officials hope the guarantee of 
citizenship will keep those residents in the colony for now 
the measure was introduced in the house of commons on wednesday 
however it faces stiff opposition from opponents of mass 
immigration

threetime gov arch a moore jr 
agreed thursday to plead guilty to extorting 573000 from a coal 
company as well as mail fraud tax fraud and obstruction of 
justice a prosecutor said 
the former republican governor could be sentenced to 36 years in 
prison and fined 12 million us attorney michael carey said in 
announcing the plea agreement and a fivecount indictment at a news 
conference 
by signing the agreement moore admitted committing illegal acts 
in his 1984 campaign his term as governor from 1984 to 1988 and 
his 1988 reelection campaign 
its tragic for the state of west virginia that an official of 
this stature was involved carey said 
this news will be greeted with a great joy by some in the 
state of west virginia moore said in a statement there will 
be others who will be sincerely grieved by reason of their devotion 
to me and my family i know i have their understanding and love 
for that i shall be ever grateful 
moores democratic successor gov gaston caperton said he 
hoped west virginians now realize that he inherited a government 
that was morally bankrupt as well as financially the backroom 
slipshod politics of the past must forever remain in the past he 
said 
it was the second time moore was indicted for alleged 
improprieties in office he and his 1972 campaign manager were 
indicted in december 1975 on a charge of extorting 25000 from the 
president of a shaky financial holding company trying to get a 
state charter for a new bank he was acquitted in 1976 
moore is the latest west virginia politician in recent years to 
either become involved in a corruption scandal or resign since 
december 1988 a state attorney general a state treasurer two 
state senate presidents a senate majority leader a top aide to a 
senate president a house member and two lobbyists have lost their 
jobs 
under the plea arrangement moore agreed to help federal 
prosecutors in their investigation of political corruption in west 
virginia carey declined to provide specific cases for which moore 
would provide information 
the us attorney said his office would make no recommendation 
to the federal judge who sentences moore he said however the 
judge would be given details of other crimes moore allegedly 
committed that are not included in thursdays indictment 
moore is accused of blocking a federal grand jurys 
investigation of him last year and this year carey said 
the obstruction of justice charges allege he falsified documents 
and tried to persuade witnesses to commit perjury carey said he 
also lied in an interview with federal investigators the 
indictment alleged 
in early january 1990 moore met with former aide john leaberry 
who was moores 1988 campaign manager the indictment said 
unknown to moore his meeting with leaberry was recorded 
the indictment said in the meeting moore discussed the fact 
that he had received and used illegal cash in the 1988 campaign and 
then told leaberry how they would both falsely deny to 
investigators and to the grand jury that there had been any such 
cash in the campaign 
the indictment also alleged moore used his office to extort 
approximately 573000 in 1985 from h paul kizer and maben energy 
corp a coal mining and processing company carey said 
moore agreed to assist kizer and maben energy with receiving a 
refund of more than 2 million from the states black lung fund 
which provides benefits to coal miners with the respiratory 
disease the indictment said 
in return moore received about 25 percent of that refund it 
said the indictment said kizer was responsible for a maben energy 
check being mailed to an unidentified attorney who took 50000 as 
his share and sent the remainder to moore carey declined to 
identify the lawyer involved 
kizer is cooperating with federal prosecutors said his 
attorney james lees 
the indictment said moore created fake backdated documents 
purporting to be legitimate contingent fee legal agreements to 
cover up the extortion 
the indictment also accused moore of filing false income tax 
returns in 1984 and 1985 carey said it said he failed to report 
40000 in income in 1984 and 105000 in 1985 
moore also was charged with scheming to defraud the state of his 
salary and benefits by funneling approximately 100000 in cash 
into his 1984 campaign fund carey said 
carey said he did not know when moore would be arraigned but 
said it probably would be within 10 to 14 days 
moore whose 67th birthday is monday was the first west 
virginia governor elected to two fouryear terms and the first 
elected to three serving from 1969 to 1977 and from 1985 to 1989 
moore survived three decades of west virginias roughandtumble 
politics despite a 2to1 registration edge for the democrats and 
almost constant controversy 
he served one term in the state house of delegates from 1953 to 
1954 and was elected to congress in 1956 at 33 moore was the 
youngest freshman in the 85th congress and represented the states 
northern panhandle for six terms 
in 1968 moore gave up his house seat to run for governor he 
was prevented from seeking a third consecutive term by a provision 
of the state constitution and was succeeded by democrat jay 
rockefeller in january 1977 
moore was dogged by controversy even out of office 
in august 1979 his former state liquor commissioner j richard 
barber was convicted of racketeering extortion and mail fraud 
involving charges that barber received cash and free liquor from 
distillers the trial included testimony that some of the cash was 
used for campaign contributions and some of the liquor was passed 
on to the governors office barber was sentenced to three years in 
prison 
moore won the governorship for the third time in 1984 however 
in that term moore presided over a state government in extreme 
financial difficulty unable to pay its bills and forced to borrow 
heavily 
his tenure ended in dramatic defeat when democratic newcomer 
gaston caperton routed him in the 1988 election

israel welcomed east germanys apology thursday 
for the atrocities of the holocaust but one senior official a 
survivor of the nazi camps said he could never grant forgiveness 
for the murder of 6 million jews 
the declaration by east germanys first freely elected 
parliament marked the first time the country formally accepted 
responsibility for nazi crimes against jews and said it was 
prepared to pay reparations to victims 
israeli officials said the declaration could ease the way toward 
establishing ties between the two countries 
but parliament speaker dov shilansky a survivor of the dachau 
concentration camp said he would never forgive the killing of 6 
million jews during world war ii 
i who have been there and have seen with my own eyes what 
happened there say that even in a thousand years the shame of 
germany will not be erased shilansky told the associated press 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said that at first glance it looks like a positive 
announcement 
asked to decribe the view of the polishborn shamir who lost 
most of his family in the holocaust ahimeir said the prime 
minister knows to put a line between the past and the future even 
though the memories are very strong at the bottom of his heart 
east germanys hardline communist rulers whose 40yearrule 
was ended last fall in a popular revolt refused to accept 
responsibility for the holocaust arguing that they themselves were 
persecuted by the nazis 
west germany apologized many years ago for nazi atrocities and 
has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations to jewish 
victims 
parliament also suggested east germany was willing to pay 
reparations saying it would do everything in its power to 
contribute to the healing of emotional and physical suffering of 
the survivors and to fight for a just compensation for material 
losses

exiled king michael of romania was barred from 
returning to his homeland thursday when the romanian government 
canceled his visa and said the monarchs first visit in 43 years 
might promote unrest 
the 68yearold exking told an airport news conference in 
zurich switzerland his visit would have been strictly private 
i dont understand the decision to rescind the visas i dont 
know what concerns there could have been he declared he was to 
have been accompanied by his wife queen anne and his eldest 
daughter princess margarita their visas were also rescinded 
romanias provisional postrevolutionary government had 
appealed to michael to postpone his visit until after may 20 
elections to prevent possible disturbances 
in bucharest several hundred romanians who had gathered to 
welcome the exking broke into chants of shame shame and 
down with the communists when they heard he was not coming 
the king was booked on a swissair flight from zurich to 
bucharest thursday at noon but the airline management decided not 
to let him board the plane he learned of the cancellation of the 
visas only after leaving his home near geneva 
in an interview with frances staterun antenne 2 television 
channel thursday romanian prime minister petre roman said michael 
had planned to attend a demonstration in the western city of 
timisoara where the december revolution began he said the visit 
would have been covered by about 80 journalists flown in especially 
by chartered plane 
thus it was not at all a private visit which we would not 
have objected to but a visit of a political character which was 
opposed by practically all political factions and by public 
opinion roman said 
silviu brucan chief ideologue of the national salvation front 
the dominant power in romanias provisional government called the 
visit a very controversial political issue 
we are striving to calm down public opinion brucan said 
referring to the ethnic violence in transylvania last month that 
left at least six people dead 
on wednesday the bucharest government warned in a statement 
that there is the possibility of some violent manifestations if 
the visit took place 
it said michaels visit before the elections could exacerbate 
existing conflicts while also endangering his personal security 
when asked at the airport to speculate on bucharests motives 
michael said he had no idea at this moment but he said he was 
still planning a visit as soon as possible 
in romania princess helen one of michaels five daughters 
said no words can express the sorrow of my father at being 
barred from romania during easter celebrations she and her sister 
sophie arrived in the country a few days ago with aid shipments 
michaels other daughters margarita anne and marie live in 
exile 
michael was forced to abdicate by a sovietinstalled government 
dec 30 1947 he had intended to stay no longer than 10 days in 
romania 
michael who has been living near geneva for the past 30 years 
denounced his abdication shortly after he arrived in exile saying 
he signed the act after being told a refusal would set off a 
massacre of his supporters 
after the overthrow of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in 
december michael said he was prepared to return to romania as head 
of a constitutional monarchy but he indicated that this would have 
to be subject to a referendum

street violence over the fatal shooting of 
a black teenager by a white policeman strained racial relations 
thursday in this tightly knit suburb which has prided itself on 
racial harmony for decades 
teenagers mostly blacks roamed city streets after a night of 
smashing windows and overturning cars the wednesday night violence 
broke out after a peaceful candlelight protest over tuesdays death 
of 15yearold phillip pannell of river edge 
the crowd of about 1000 protesters called for a special 
prosecutor to investigate the shooting 
gov jim florio asked for calm but said he saw no reason to 
appoint a special prosecutor because the county prosecutor is a 
deputy attorney general florio also said he would not put the 
national guard on alert 
i am being kept informed of events there and i will await 
further investigation before determining what other action by state 
officials may be required he said at a statehouse news 
conference in trenton 
city police chief bryan burke held a news conference outside 
police headquarters and warned against further violence 
its stopped as far as im concerned burke said were 
not going to tolerate any more unlawfulness there will be 
arrests 
the chief promised a large contingent of local county and state 
police would remain in the new york city suburb for about a week 
he declined to estimate property damage from wednesday nights 
violence but said six police cars were destroyed many store 
windows were shattered 
witnesses said police pushed the protesters into the parking lot 
of police headquarters and some women and children were trampled 
the crowd retaliated by turning over cars and throwing rocks and 
other debris through the windows of the municipal building 
four police officers and at least three civilians were injured 
none of the injuries appeared serious 
an attorney for the boys family franklin wilks said he had 
notified the borough county and state that a lawsuit was planned 
pannells mother thelma pannell told a news conference 
thursday that the lawsuit would help keep the case open 
they can kill all the black kids until people realize that it 
could be their sons who get killed ms pannell said its not 
going to stop here my son will not die like this shot in the 
back 
others however both black and white readily spoke about the 
predominantly positive racial relations in this town of 37000 
people eight miles from new york 
state sen matthew feldman a former mayor said this community 
has prided itself on its ability for people of all races to live in 
harmony 
this is the first town in america to integrate and we did it 
ourselves not by order of the supreme court feldman said 
referring to the citys voluntary integration of its schools in the 
1960s 
on april 1 the national association for the advancement of 
colored people and the bnai brith honored feldman who is white 
and municipal judge isaac mcnatt who is black for their efforts 
in achieving racial harmony between jews and blacks in teaneck 
but people also talked about the shooting and some said it had 
been preceded by ill will between the police department and black 
men in town 
the rev glenn wilson pastor of calvary baptist church and a 
speaker at the vigil wednesday said that he and other blacks often 
are pulled over by police 
it may not be camelot but there is a nice climate here he 
said unfortunately the problem is between the black community 
and the police they stop blacks on a routine basis certain police 
officers single out youths for selective law enforcement 
things wont go back to normal not until the cop goes on 
trial for murder said maurice jones 17 a black teaneck high 
school student 
adults on both sides of racial lines in this town where 64 
percent of the residents are white and 24 percent are black talked 
about pannells shooting 
its not black against white its a matter of a policeman who 
made a terrible mistake we need to put a cap on this right now 
said resident robert robinson who is black 
officer gary spath 29 who fired the fatal shot reported to 
the prosecutors office to answer questions on the shooting of 
pannell who died from a single gunshot in the back spath was 
suspended with pay and his gun was impounded as evidence 
officials said 
burke said spath was responding to an anonymous telephone tip 
that a teenager had drawn a gun on another youth 
acting bergen county prosecutor john holl said police told him a 
gun was found on the youths body a contention that some of 
pannells friends denied 
spath last month received his fifth commendation from the 
teaneck policemans benevolent association since he joined the 
department in 1982 
mayor frank hall a white who has been on borough council for 24 
years and said he was involved in the 1960s integration of the 
schools said the violence may have been caused by outside 
agitators who wore red hats or scarves and broke away from 
wednesdays vigil 
there were many cars with new york plates you could say they 
came to help their brothers and thats fine but they dont have a 
stake in teaneck like we do hall said

the bush administration is preparing a 
proposal to ease restrictions on sales of hightechnology items to 
the emerging democracies of eastern europe but the changes likely 
will not go far enough to satisfy western allies 
commerce undersecretary dennis kloske who supervises export 
control activities said wednesday there was growing agreement in 
the administration over the actions needed to provide western 
technology to the struggling economies of poland hungary and other 
former communist bloc countries 
the administration is conducting a review and recommendations 
on what changes can be made without jeopardizing national security 
should be presented to president bush by the end of this month 
kloske said 
there is an emerging consensus inside the administration that 
the changing developments in eastern europe will allow for a 
significant level of streamlining of export controls kloske told

american ballistics expert with an alleged plot by iraq to 
construct a huge gun capable of firing nuclear or chemical shells 
hundreds of miles 
eight crates awaiting shipment to iraq when they were seized by 
customs agents at the northeast english port of middlesbrough 
included what were believed to be parts for a 131foot gun barrel

largest gun barrel ever made 
a spokesman for britains customs and excise department said 
wednesday last night we intercepted a consignment of goods being 
loaded upon a ship that was destined for iraq a ship that had been 
chartered by the iraqi maritime services the goods appear to be of 
a military nature 
iraq denied this the official iraqi news agency said the 
consignment was steel pipes for a petrochemical project

doctors decisions to give tests or take xrays 
depend in part on how much money they make on them a study today 
says 
the research supports the widely held but hard to document idea 
that doctors own financial interests play a role in determining 
the kind and amount of care they give their patients 
as in most professions money matters said david hemenway 
a harvard school of public health economist who directed the study 
the report in todays new england journal of medicine measured 
what happened when a chain of walkin clinics changed the way it 
paid its doctors instead of a flat hourly wage doctors could earn 
a percentage of all the fees they generated 
with this financial incentive they boosted the number of tests 
and xrays they performed by about 20 percent 
the study was conducted in 1984 and 1985 at bostonarea offices 
of health stop the nations biggest chain of walkin clinics with 
80 centers in six states

an experimental aids drug injected into two 
pregnant monkeys reached their fetuses raising hope that it might 
block aids virus infection of human babies by their mothers 
scientists said today 
if used early enough in pregnancy it might ward off perinatal 
aids infection said study coauthor daniel capon of genentech inc 
of south san francisco 
the drug reached the fetuses about as easily as a human mothers 
natural proteins do as they build up disease resistance within 
babies researchers said 
the drug called a cd4 immunoadhesin has shown promise against 
the aids virus in the test tube but its effectiveness in people is 
not yet known

the rev raymond probasco encouraged the mourners to continue to 
seek a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome

as a rule any sitcom that needs more than two 
executive producers tends to be lame nbcs new down home has 
three including cheers star ted danson 
on the bright side its not about teenage mutant ninja 
turtles that should count for something 
premiering saturday after what nbc called a special preview 
on thursday down home stars judith ivey a fine broadway 
actress who has tony awards for her work in steaming and 
hurlyburly 
but here she seems like a fish out of water this is not good 
since down home is set in a texas seacoast fishing village 
thursdays preview established that she plays kate mccrorey a 
successful new york management consultant who returns home on 
vacation to the little village to find her dads cafe and bait shop 
business failing 
worse a developer represented by her old boyfriend ray baker 
of 15 years ago wants to demolish the village and turn it into one 
of those resorts that have hotels timeshare condos minimalls and 
probably cable tv 
well by neddies she decides to forgo fun city and her career 
there and help her daddy dakin matthews fight what passes for 
progress 
thats pretty much it although it took a while for her to reach 
that decision not to mention be kissed by and fight with her old 
flambee 
in between the preview presented the other regulars among them 
her hulking brother eric allen kramer and a young optimistic 
vietnamese refugee gedde watanabe the cook and dishwasher at the 
cafe 
although strained thursdays premiere did have a few good 
moments the first when the towns laconic mayor a fisherman 
drifted into the cafe and was greeted with a jovial how the fish 
treatin you 
his offhand reply aw better than the missus they aint 
bitin 
it should be noted that tim scott is a standout in his deadpan 
mayoral role he seems a keen student of good ol boy texas ways 
even to the point of wearing a faded vietnamera marine camouflage 
jacket in one scene 
but saturdays premiere about fishing football and daring to 
dream is so thin on plot and dialogue it wouldnt even get a 
coveted emmy award for best lame episode of a comedy series with 
three executive producers 
ivey gives both episodes her best shot but she often seems to 
be pressing as if hoping her vitality will hide the fact that the 
scripts basically are a case of nobody home 
incidental note the closing credits of thursdays preview had 
10 people listed as assistants in saturdays show the number 
rises to 12 
if it goes up to 14 assistants next time were asking geraldo 
rivera to fly to hollywood and see what gives

elsewhere in television 
tunein time if you get cables home box office dont miss 
carly simons carly in concert my romance on sunday its a 
classy show the fine old romantic kind of concert that even has a 
string orchestra generous in sharing the spotlight with visitor 
harry connick jr whom she puckishly describes as at 22 the 
grand old man of standards simon gives lovely readings to a good 
collection of standards among my funny valentine and by 
myself she also includes a few simon standards of course and 
does a wonderful exuberant bossa nova version of we have no 
secrets 
if you miss sundays show not to worry itll be rerun five 
more times if youre not among the 173 million cable viewers who 
pay extra for hbo get her new my romance album it features 
many of the same songs and the same tasty marty paich string 
arrangements 
the thrill of victory the agony of third this tv season ends 
sunday and while this weeks nielsens for prime time wont be 
available until tuesday ratings analysts say nbc easily will win 
its fifth consecutive season and that abc will be no 2 again cbs 
which once led the pack will be third for the third consecutive 
season thats costly both in image and advertising revenue

james galway loves to travel with his 
audiences on musical adventures that make different tunes dance 
from his flute 
he plays beethoven with a smile and irish ballads with the 
chieftains last year he toured with 30 children and the baltimore 
symphony as the pied piper of hamelin in a musical fantasy 
written especially for him by composer john corigliano 
now hes coming out with a new lp the enchanted forest 
galway teamed up with a roomful of synthesizers to make the album 
and then topped it off with an mtv video 
but galway doesnt know how to describe the new work because he 
dislikes labels 
so dont call it new wave he said just call it a unique 
type of which there is no other like it 
galway loves music and his temper can flare up at anyone or 
anything that tries to complicate it even the contracts he must 
sign for all of his ventures must be straightforward we have a 
rule in our office if we cant read it we dont sign it he 
says 
last year he turned 50 and classical magazine calls this period 
the golden days of galway as the flutist allows himself to pick 
and choose his schedule 
i can think of a lot of things i want to do and what i cant 
think of somebody else does he says with a laugh i sure 
dont need the money so i do the ones i want to do 
he makes his opera debut april 16 in a new production of 
rossinis the thieving magpie the next evening he begins a 
tour in california that ends may 9 in new york with a stop at 
the tonight show starring johnny carson 
he has a performance schedule that goes from here to there and 
back interjects his wife jeanne who travels with him she 
performs with him in chamber groups and will play the part of the 
magpie in the second and final philadelphia performance on april 20 
the idea to play the title role in rossinis the thieving 
magpie was not galways 
i had never thought of it before and no one else did it 
before so i decided to do it galway says 
the opera had its american debut in 1827 in philadelphia but no 
flutist has ever been cast as the magpie 
during rehearsals in philadelphia galways impish side surfaced 
from time to time at one point he put a boom box on his 
shoulder and said james galway and the 20 best hits from the 
street hows that for my new album 
underneath the wit the blunt charm and the bantering nature 
that has endeared him to audiences galway is very serious about 
his craft and is devoted to practice sessions hes also fiercely 
independent about his way whatever way that may be at the moment 
of playing 
i wouldnt play in an orchestra now he says i wouldnt 
want to narrow my music down 
however galway did branch into serious acting once 
i needed money while i was between guildhall school in 
london and the paris conservatory so i took a year off and did 
shakespeare at stratfordonavon he said 
but he said he was never serious about a switch ive always 
thought of music nothing else 
it was the combination of acting and music complete with a 
costume and intricate staging while playing his magic flute that 
appealed to galway in doing the opera 
rossini originally wrote the work using an actor as the magpie 
who stole the silver spoon and caused a young servant girl to be 
sentenced to death the opera company of philadelphia decided in 
the first american production of the work in this century to create 
a special role for someone such as galway 
the rolling notes that galway plays as he flits about the stage 
were borrowed from passages rossini wrote for the violin and flute 
as parts of the orchestra 
for his motions on stage galway draws on his own observations 
of the bird an outgrowth of his interest in the animal kingdom 
he talked about the latest television program he had enjoyed on 
animals in the wild then with a burst of galway directness denied 
that his performance was to be a statement on anything but music 
i didnt study birds for years to do this i studied music 
he says it just so happens that i would know a dead magpie in 
the road if i saw one

last year poles showered soviet soldiers 
with rocks and bottles 21 times during a 210mile training march 
this year prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki opposes a speedy red 
army withdrawal 
they have disdained soviet soldiers for decades but poles seem 
to understand mazowieckis point 
poland has not joined czechoslovakia and hungary in the rush to 
be free of the red army not because it loathes the occupiers 
less but because it fears the army of a reunited germany at least 
as much 
the solidarity prime minister leader of the first noncommunist 
government to take office in the former soviet bloc envisions a 
soviet withdrawal only within an overall security arrangement for 
europe 
a survey by televisions center for public opinion research in 
march indicated 47 percent of poles felt the red army should go 
but the date should depend on events in germany 
maybe a year ago people would say the soviet troops shouldnt 
be here that their presence was more like a political presence 
said franciszek grzywacz a magazine editor in the garrison town of 
legnica now people are saying it is a kind of a shield against 
germany 
polands predicament is as old as its geographical position 
between germany and russia and has led new voices to utter a 
version of the old regimes argument 
for decades the communists used the danger from germany 
combined with the general threat from the west to support polands 
alliance with moscow and the red army presence 
most estimates put the number of soviet soldiers in poland at 
40000 to 45000 well below the 380000 in east germany 80000 in 
czechoslovakia and 65000 in hungary 
those in poland however form the supply link from the soviet 
union to the east german frontier of the warsaw pact 
one of the most important soviet military headquarters the 
western theater of military operations is in legnica in 
southwestern poland 55 miles from east germany the headquarters 
would coordinate a warsaw pact offensive using the baltic fleet 
air force support and troops from across eastern europe 
legnica 250 miles southeast of warsaw is one of the few places 
in poland where the red army is visible the wellpreserved painted 
brick architecture is a reminder of the towns place in the swath 
of silesian territory taken from germany after world war ii 
most of its 100000 people however are poles uprooted from 
eastern territories annexed by the soviet union under josef stalin 
that adds emotion to the atmosphere as soviet officers stroll 
the streets and black russian limousines rush commanders to and 
from prewar mansions in a vast red army compound enclosed by by a 
7foot concrete wall 
tales of soviet army abuses are legion secret installations in 
the forest bombs gone astray ditches running black with leaking 
fuel from military airports lowflying planes buzzing farms 
russianbashing is a popular sport soviet soldiers live 
rentfree and make slums of the scarce apartments denied to poles 
cover windows with copies of pravda instead of curtains throw 
garbage out the windows favor strip shows are above polish law 
when they commit crimes or cause traffic accidents 
if the soviets go home people in this town will have nothing 
to talk about said grzywacz the magazine editor 
teacher jolanta tochinecka does not see the red army as a 
safeguard poles know they can rely only on themselves he 
said that was shown in 1939 when the german invasion of 
poland started world war ii 
scrawled slogans may say tanks to the volga and one roughly 
translates to soviets go back to your garbage but the soldiers 
are an economic benefit to legnica 
there is a brisk trade in soviet gold and television sets 
outside the elegant turnofthecentury officers center 
shopkeepers rely on the wellpaid soldiers and their families who 
relish the relatively comfortable fiveyear tours in poland 
residents speak gratefully of access to sophisticated hospitals 
and some other facilities the soviets have their own schools 
police force book stores and work crews but the communities are 
largely separate

the boos drowned out dianne feinstein when she 
told california democrats yes i support the death penalty 
but the former san francisco mayor was betting that her stand would 
draw cheers from voters worried about drugs and crime 
her judgment is echoed in campaigns from california to the 
eastern seaboard from the sun belt to the rust belt it is an 
election year in which death and politics are locked in a 
rhetorical embrace and candidates engage in macabre numbers games 
in a campaign ad republican gov bob martinez of florida 
proclaims he has signed some 90 death warrants but only five 
people have been executed since martinez took office in 1987 
as district attorney and attorney general hes put or kept 277 
murderers on death row said an ad for john van de kamp who says 
he personally opposes capital punishment nobodys been executed in 
23 years in california where van de kamp and feinstein are 
battling for the democratic nomination for governor 
theres a very clear consensus all over the electorate that 
the death penalty is a good thing said republican political 
consultant charles black 
lynn cutler a vice chair of the democratic national committee 
lamented the fact that so many candidates glory about their 
roles in executions but she conceded that the majority of the 
people strongly support the death penalty 
the death penalty has become this sort of simplistic litmus 
test or symbolic test of whether youre tough on crime said 
frank greer a democratic consultant who questions whether voters 
will be satisfied with ringing endorsements of capital punishment 
you can make a case that a lot of people will wake up to find 
voters expect more said greer 
he found support for his case in texas where state treasurer 
ann richards won a vicious contest for the democratic nomination 
for governor 
richards two opponents former gov mark white and attorney 
general jim mattox competed for the right to claim they had 
executed the most criminals prompting a richards aide to quip 
maybe the next step will be scratchandsniff ads so voters can 
sample the smell of the death chamber 
my view on the death penalty is that its the law and that the 
law should be carried out said richards who rarely mentioned 
the issue 
she once referred to whites ads which showed him walking past 
giant mug shots of criminals executed while he was governor and 
said i think perhaps they are contrasting me with a guy who goes 
on tv and struts up and down in front of pictures of people who 
have been executed its macabre and strange 
time may prove greer right but the consensus among politicians 
including greer client andrew young is that the place to be is in 
support of capital punishment 
the state has got to have the right to put mad dogs to 
death said young the former mayor of atlanta who is campaigning 
for governor of georgia 
long an opponent of capital punishment young said his view 
began to change after he went to a half dozen policemens 
funerals while mayor 
van de kamp the early favorite to win californias democratic 
gubernatorial primary suddenly found himself scrambling after 
polls showed feinstein soaring into the lead analysts were divided 
on whether her surge was attributable to a particular issue like 
capital punishment or the result of a large television buy during a 
period when van de kamp was not running commercials 
but it was clear that van de kamp and his strategists thought 
hed better edge away from his opposition to the death penalty 
as state attorney general van de kamp took a prominent role in 
asking the us supreme court to end a stay of execution granted 
robert alton harris a prisoner on death row in san quentin prison 
this is a man who said he didnt believe in the death penalty 
up until the time he began running for governor said feinstein 
i am running the law office responsible for handling the 
case van de kamp responded angrily 
the most prominent exception to the rhetorical rush to the 
execution chamber is democratic gov mario cuomo of new york 
cuomo is expected to run for a third term this year and his name 
is always high on lists of presidential prospects 
lee miringoff of the marist college institute of public opinion 
said his polls of new york voters have found little evidence cuomo 
is hurt by his opposition to the death penalty despite polls 
showing overwhelming public support for capital punishment 
no ones going to accuse mario cuomo of making policy by 
public opinion polls said miringoff the fact that mario cuomo 
opposes the death penalty and has a proposal for life imprisonment 
without parole comes as no news to new yorkers hes able to make 
in new york the case that hes a man of strong convictions so that 
even if you disagree with him on this issue it doesnt affect your 
overall view of him

it is a modern urban phenomenon kids robbing 
and sometimes killing other kids over the hottest designer 
sneakers sunglasses or athletic jackets 
in chicago alone four young men have died in little more than a 
year over multicolored satiny jackets with splashy team logos 
across the back 
those not dying for their clothing might instead be robbed 
on an icy day this winter an 11yearold boy was forced to hand 
over his 61 gym shoes to four youths then walk the several blocks 
to his home barefoot one of scores of incidents that occur each 
month police say 
kids who try to keep their jackets are beaten or killed 
said sollie vincent commander of the gang crimes section of the 
chicago police its a very cold callous frame of mind 
to combat the problem schools from baltimore to miami to los 
angeles are falling back on an old idea dress codes 
some public schools even have instituted uniforms traditionally 
associated with parochial schools 
its a definite trend said tim callahan a spokesman for 
the national association of state boards of education kids are 
going to learn best in an environment free of undue inappropriate 
pressures and certainly one thats free of violence 
if clothing becomes a disruption to education then we 
certainly are supportive of removing that barrier he said 
starter jackets athletic jackets named for their 
manufacturer starter sportswear inc of new haven conn have 
sparked numerous crimes in chicago including four murders police 
say 
in a grim acknowledgment of the garments popularity the police 
department last year created a separate category for starter 
jacket murders in its citywide statistics 
we are hoping these are isolated situations that are not 
longterm said thomas mcauliffe human resources director for 
starter we have a responsible attitude towards the communities 
in which we have operations 
educators say dress codes that eliminate some popular items and 
in some cases gang colors not only help stem violence but allow 
students to concentrate on learning 
we try to discourage children from buying hot items says 
jim murray assistant principal at a middle school in chicagos 
troubled englewood neighborhood when they dont wear those items 
to school they dont have problems 
we have found that subtly it is changing attitudes 
alberta mitchell counselor at hendricks academy said of the 
chicago public elementary schools new uniform policy 
the children are not supposed to wear gym shoes so that 
eliminates the problem of buying brandname gym shoes symbolizing 
status miss mitchell said we are trying to eliminate the 
problem of children feeling like they have to have designertype 
clothes it seems to have a calming effect 
in chicago as in many of the nations largest school districts 
dress codes are the prerogative of individual schools 
in baltimore uniforms are recommended although not mandatory 
for elementary school students and a dress code is suggested for 
secondary schools educators say uniforms now are the norm at 74 of 
the citys 118 elementary schools 
school officials cant recall any crimes over clothing since the 
policy was instituted last fall and baltimore police say the 
problem virtually has disappeared 
it still happens but not with any frequency said police 
spokesman dennis hill 
next fall high schools in detroit will have the option of 
adopting a dress code the new policy by detroits board of 
education was prompted in part by the december shooting of a 
student over his 135 goosedown jacket 
detroit police say crimes over clothing are on the decline 
its not like the old days 10 years ago said sgt 
christopher buck 
in new yorks bedfordstuyvesant neighborhood a high school 
principal earlier this year barred students from wearing removable 
gold caps on their teeth saying the faddish caps were robberies 
waiting to happen 
but the new policies have not been cheered in all quarters 
in march high school students in palmdale calif enraged by a 
new antigang dress code boycotted classes and pelted a sheriffs 
patrol car with rocks 
and there is some support for student resistance to the 
dresscode trend 
laws allowing schools to require uniforms are a way of trying 
to see that all students look alike act alike and think alike 
said jane whicher an attorney for the american civil liberties 
union in illinois 
its important for children to have an appreciation of their 
own individuality as well as the constitutional values that protect 
that individuality she said orthodoxy in apparel is not 
something a school board should be involved in 
requiring uniforms might also pose a financial hurdle for the 
poor whicher said but some families are applauding the trend 
parents seem to really like the idea said shel erlich a 
spokesman for the los angeles unified school district the nations 
secondlargest public school system it certainly cuts down the 
amount of arguing in the morning over what the kids should wear to 
school 
and some parents are instituting their own dress codes when the 
schools are not 
i have two daughters one a senior in high school said 
charles hill who heads security for 40 chicago schools we dont 
entertain the thought of a starter jacket 
we want our kids to have everything he said but we dont 
want our kids to have something that endangers their lives 
law enforcement officials welcome the move toward dress codes 
any way that a kid can avoid the problem seems rational to 
me said vincent of the gang crime unit parents would be a 
little kinder to their kids if they deprived them of the things 
they beg for

when looters plundered 
their candy and tobacco shop in the chaos that accompanied 
hurricane hugo seven months ago hal and mary longer decided to 
return to the states 
now theyve decided to stay touched by the unexpected honesty 
of some of the looters 
while cleaning up their ransacked shop the longers were 
astonished to find a dozen ious from people who took part in a 
threeday looting rampage on st croix island after hugo struck 
sept 17 
then other fellow residents realtors business people a 
lawyer even a territorial senator began stopping by to confess 
they too had taken things from the store and would pay for them 
it makes me feel great that there are some honest people in 
the world longer 63 said recently in his refurbished store 
it restores your faith his wife 49 said from behind the 
candy counter 
of the three main us virgin islands east of puerto rico the 
hurricane hit st croix by far the hardest about 90 percent of the 
houses were destroyed or damaged and reconstruction continues on 
the island which has 55000 permanent residents 
st croixs image as a caribbean tourist haven was tarnished by 
the looting 
scores of businesses were plundered about 100 people were 
arrested and even some police officers and national guardsmen were 
accused of taking part in the looting 
president bush sent 1100 military police who remained for two 
months 
the longers who moved to st croix from davenport iowa in 
1987 were visiting philadelphia when the hurricane struck they 
returned two weeks later to find their shop called steeles smokes 
amp sweets for a previous owner in ruins 
the place was a mess longer said the inventory was 
trashed and even the scales were gone cleaning up was the worst 
because they threw stuff all over the walls there was no need for 
that 
their house also was heavily damaged the longers said they were 
ready to move back to the mainland 
that was before they found ious for stolen goods that had been 
left for them in their own shop and the one next door 
one scribbled on an envelope said i took four boxes of 
cigars i am one of your regular customers i will pay you when i 
see you bill 
on the back of the envelope someone else wrote i took some 
too don longer said 
bill and don later paid their total debt of 100 he said and 
added every one of the people but one has voluntarily come in to 
pay and i know the one will 
longer said a man walked in one day wandered around as if 
looking for something to buy then handed him 27 for six tins of 
stolen pipe tobacco and the guys had a smile on his face every 
time hes come back in the shop 
other st croix shopkeepers had similar experiences 
jeff seroogy 39 owns the solitude country store a grocery in 
the islands affluent east end after he reopened seroogy said 
people approached him wanting to make amends 
when i was first told of some of the people who were in the 
store and what they were doing i was really mad just very angry 
and disappointed he said but when they started coming back 
and indeed came forth and paid i wasnt angry 
hal and mary longer said their rebuilding costs were 136000 
including 37000 in damaged or stolen inventory and insurance 
covered all but 14000 of the loss 
the main reason they decided to stay they said is the way 
their customers have treated them since the hurricane 
lt gov derek hodge said the ious showed many looters were 
ordinary people panicked by the ferocious storm 
in the darkest days of our despair there were those who 
recognized being a good citizen still had a value he said

actor kevin spacey says care was taken to see 
that the story of jim and tammy bakker in nbcs fall from grace 
didnt lapse into caricature 
you have to play a real person said spacey who stars as 
the convicted television evangelist in the sunday movie bernadette 
peters costars as bakkers wife tammy 
you have to have a respect for that human being regardless of 
whats happened to him spacey said were all familiar with 
the ridicule and criticism once you get past the fact that i dont 
really look like jim bakker you get into their life and problems 
as a married couple we never got into a cartoon no one wanted to 
make this a joke i tried to play him as a man not so much an 
imitation as a suggestion 
the movie tells the personal story behind the rise and fall of 
bakkers empire built upon his success as a television minister 
it begins in 1980 with his dream of heritage village and ends with 
his ouster from the ptl ministry in may 1987 
nbc paid the bakkers for the rights to their story but said it 
did not give them any control over the story 
bakker currently is serving a 45year prison sentence for 
bilking money out of his followers to support his lavish lifestyle 
spacey perhaps best known for his role as mel proffit on cbs 
wiseguy turned down the role when it first was offered 
i was reluctant to do it but changed my mind after talking to 
the director karen arthur he said when it was offered to me 
i had the same reaction as other people they laughed and said 
another trashy tv movie rehashing headlines karen showed me that 
it was going to be much more complex than the headlines 
when bakker first came to notice he was a beaten man he was 
clawing at air i think thats why people had a pathetic view of 
him we look at him when he was at the peak of his career and 
energy we also stay away from the caricature of tammy as a crying 
woman with mascara running down her face it may have happened in 
real life but not to the extent of all the ridicule and gags 
the only concessions to making spacey look like bakker were a 
hairpiece and a dental appliance to change the shape of his mouth 
the movie written by ken trevey also stars beth grant as 
tammys confidant richard herd as bakker assistant richard dortch 
and richard paul as the rev jerry falwell jean kasem makes a 
cameo appearance as a real estate saleswoman 
after completing the movie in los angeles spacey returned to 
new york for a new stage play called national anthems which he 
had done at the long wharf theatre in new haven conn with tom 
berenger another actor will be cast in berengers role for the 
broadway version 
spacey also stars in the upcoming theatrical movie show of 
force along with robert duvall and andy garcia 
show of force is based on a true story about the killing of 
young proindependence students in puerto rico based on the book 
murder under two flags by ann nelson he plays the head of the 
fbi office in san juan 
hes also been in such movies as dad the right stuff 
the unbearable lightness of being heartburn working 
girl and henry and june which hasnt yet been released 
spacey has appeared three times with jack lemmon playing his 
son in the broadway production of long days journey into 
night his soninlaw in the movie dad and a reporter in 
the murder of mary phagan a 1987 nbc miniseries based on the 
lynching of leo frank in which lemmon played the governor of 
georgia 
he looks back fondly on his wiseguy role 
proffit was a man who on the surface was an entrepreneur 
spacey said he was well known for giving to charities but his 
actual business was gunrunning and drugs he had an illicit 
relationship with his sister it was pretty racy for television 
thats a terrific show for actors he said you know 
youre going to create a terrific character you also know its 
only for a limited time you get the feel of television without 
having to commit to a series

daniel patrick moynihans career hasnt fit 
the traditional pattern while most senators work to change votes 
he works to change minds 
so theres no moynihan act or moynihan amendment to mark the 
pinnacle of his senate tenure his is a different approach 
wholesale instead of retail 
what moynihan loves to do is take an idea pluck it out of the 
heavens set it on the table and let it influence events says 
rep charles schumer dny 
the former professor diplomat and white house official has done 
it time and again he puts forward an idea that at first goes 
against common wisdom but stays alive despite efforts by others to 
proclaim it dead 
in the 1960s as an official first in democratic and then 
republican administrations moynihan wrote about the instability of 
black family life and its harmful effects on blacks chance of 
success controversial at first his ideas two decades later drove 
the 1988 welfare reform act 
after president ford made him united nations ambassador in 1975 
moynihan rocked the diplomatic corps by bluntly asserting us 
positions he was particularly sharptongued in opposing a 
resolution labeling zionism as a form of racism he stayed only 
eight months before returning to harvard but he established the 
model for his us successors at the world body 
in 1976 he was elected to the senate giving up his 
professorship but he has clung to the image of an academician 
tall grayhaired and tweedclothed he seems able to lecture his 
colleagues on an infinite range of topics 
hes never had an unspoken thought quipped one colleague 
his occasional meetings with washington reporters are called 
tutorials by the attendees who sit in chairs arranged 
classroomlike in his office 
he doesnt just answer questions he expounds on most anything 
at one recent session he described the life cycle of the sea 
lamprey a parasitic fish whose control he supports noting that it 
was really a nice piece of biology 
unlike many lawmakers the burden of elected office has not 
dampened moynihans taste for the controversial his latest idea on 
social security has revitalized that penchant 
back in 1983 moynihan was the intellectual force behind an 
increase in social security payroll taxes so that the system could 
build up a surplus for when the baby boom generation retires 
the surplus is now building at a rate of 1 billion a week but 
instead of being saved for the future as moynihan intended its 
being frittered away to cover daytoday government operating 
expenses and make the federal deficit appear smaller 
washingtons leaders promise to make the surplus offbudget 
and thus more sacrosanct but in reality that answer is nothing 
more than how you display your books moynihan says 
his solution roll back the payroll tax simple but the 
political implications are immense 
the white house and even some fellow democrats such as house 
ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill label the idea as 
dangerous the politicians dont like to admit that social security 
taxes are being misused but nobody seems willing to cut spending 
or raise other taxes enough to take their place 
some fretted with prodding from president bush that the plan 
was somehow messing with social security a political nono 
one official even called it goofy but the biggest white house 
worry was that a democrat was treading on turf the republicans 
thought they owned tax cuts 
unlike bushs cherished capital gains tax cut moynihans 
benefits would be tilted to the working poor and middle class 
political genius is what democratic national committee 
chairman ronald brown called it last month just when congress 
seemed to be putting it on the backmost burner the dnc endorsed 
the plan 
the dnc can do exactly what it wants responded house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo they are not in the 
congress and they dont have the responsibility to actually produce 
a budget we dont have a consensus in the congress today to do 
moynihan 
senate majority leader george mitchell said moynihans idea will 
be put up for a vote in his chamber but the opposition including 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas says chances for 
passage this year are dim 
moynihan said if the people he meets outside of washington had 
their way his proposal would already be enacted but the capitals 
bureaucracy takes time to turn around so for now he may have to 
settle for less he said 
if i have one minimum ambition its that before this is over 
the first paragraph of stories about the federal budget and federal 
revenues would include that theyre using 72 billion in trust 
fund monies moynihan said 
theres no telling when or if his social security plan will fly 
but moynihan reveling in the spotlight has found plenty else to 
talk about 
for example he used a speech before the national press club to 
press his ideas about lithuania pushing the almost quaint 
suggestion that the world court at the hague could serve as the 
mechanism to defuse the dispute between the soviet union and its 
baltic republics 
he also is continuing his lonely effort to promote us 
development of technologically advanced trains that ride on 
magnetic fields instead of regular tracks 
could you have a senate of 100 moynihans no but is it great 
to have a few sure says rep schumer who is rumored to be 
eyeing a 1992 race against moynihans junior republican colleague 
sen alfonse damato rny 
the juxtaposition with damato widely known as senator 
pothole for his attention to local issues sometimes makes 
moynihan look as though he pays little attention to the home folks 
but one of moynihans favorite topics is a local one taking the 
tolls off the new york thruway 
the idea of removing the tolls started in 1956 when moynihan 
was an aide to the governor of new york and the free system of 
federal interstate highways was being started 
i was a member of the new york delegation to the 1960 
democratic national convention i went to los angeles with one 
platform plank in my pocket tolls off the thruway he wrote in a 
letter to voters in 1982 from his schoolhouse hideaway near pindars 
corners in upstate new york 
sixteen years later i was a candidate for the senate i 
promised that i would press to take the tolls off the thruway he 
said finally in 1982 we signed the agreement to take 
tolls off in 1996 40 years after the effort began 
no business for the shortwinded moynihan concluded

political leadership according to the 
democrat who wields it in the house means governing rather than 
incessant campaigning even if the style looks bashful 
and speaker of the house thomas s foley said he wont change 
his ways despite the dissatisfaction of some democrats who argue 
that leaders should be more confrontational posting clear themes 
and alternatives to challenge the republican in the white house 
were unwilling to simply be an opposition party and probe 
every weak spot foley said adding that people who advocate that 
course view the democrats as a party out of power despite their 
command of congress 
thats not the case the speaker said we are in control 
here part of the time we have to worry between elections 
about the countrys government 
maybe were not doing it well enough but its not because 
were bashful foley said 
foley has been speaker for 10 months since the resignation of 
jim wright after the ethics investigation that marked wrights 
final days the washington congressman was promoted as a skilled 
legislator with a television style that would help the new team of 
democratic congressional leaders present the party message in 
counterpoint to president bush 
now some democrats are complaining that the partys house and 
senate hierarchy isnt making the case that there is no real 
alternative program or theme and that rep richard a gephardt 
dmo the majority leader is the only person in the lineup 
willing to tackle bush 
in the audience as president bush addressed the american society 
of newspaper editors gov james j blanchard of michigan remarked 
that democrats arent presenting an alternative vision of where the 
country should be heading especially in domestic policies and 
programs 
sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts complained last week 
that the party seems muted timid and befuddled when it should be 
seizing the opportunities presented by the easing of eastwest 
tensions 
with a few notable exceptions there has been a kind of 
unnatural quiet coming from our party a sense of yielding ground 
to the president of kowtowing to his veto threats of confining 
our own democratic efforts to merely marginal improvements in 
republican programs or almost conceding a second term to president 
bush kennedy said in a speech at georgetown university 
over a spartan breakfast in the house restaurant hes dieted 
away 40 pounds foley said his natural inclination is to seek 
solutions first and have political arguments later he said there 
will be plenty to argue about before the session ends 
foley said democratic pressure has pushed bush from timid 
proposals into more ambitious ones on some fronts hes doing 
more on eastern europe now because we demanded it the speaker 
said he said the same thing happened on drug control on clean air 
and on child care legislation although the democratic majority is 
still pushing farther than bush wanted 
we may have some tough disagreements in front of the country 
on some of these issues foley said im not going to roll over 
and drop dead because the president says veto so threaten 
veto go ahead 
the next line of course is make my day but thats not foleys 
style 
he said democratic leaders are not shying from confrontation 
because of bushs still lofty popularity ratings the popularity 
is very personal he said but it has a limited political 
consequence his popularity doesnt translate to legislative 
influence or party preference 
foley said there is no voter pressure to support bush programs 
nothing like the message from home when ronald reagan was pushing 
his firstterm tax cut there isnt any bush revolution he 
said adding that the administration is drifting when it should be 
leading 
then reflecting on the point he added that nobody has an 
agenda challenging the country to confront real problems and both 
parties share the blame thats my complaint against all of us 
foley said 
again the conciliatory ring that bothers some democrats it 
doesnt bother foley he looks back to the days of sam rayburn the 
legendary mr speaker and of lyndon b johnson as senate majority 
leader recalling their private visits to dwight d eisenhowers 
white house to work out legislation 
if anything the government was less confrontational then than 
it is now he said

the use of dna identification to link suspects 
to crimes is being successfully challenged by defense attorneys in 
a small but growing number of cases 
at issue are the reliability of the tests and the way they are 
conducted 
in the last year i am aware of at least seven or eight cases 
where after the defense got an expert involved the prosecution has 
withdrawn the evidence says lawyer peter neufeld who 
successfully challenged dna test results in a new york city murder 
case last summer 
the judge in the case cited problems with the laboratory 
analysis 
since it was first introduced in a us criminal court in 1987 
dna testing has been presented in 200 cases in at least 36 states 
the fbi opened its own dna lab in late 1988 to test samples for 
state and local police departments since then bureau experts have 
presented evidence that has helped convict 44 people 
with everything we have seen so far we are gaining confidence 
in the dna identifications utility in serving the criminal justice 
community said john hicks head of the fbis laboratory division 
the tests compare genetic material extracted from tissue or body 
fluids found at crime scenes with dna from a suspects blood 
while law enforcement authorities hail dna identification 
defense lawyers have won several victories by exposing what courts 
found to be flaws in testing procedures 
among them 
the minnesota supreme court refused in november to admit dna 
test results in a murder case saying the laboratory of cellmark 
diagnostics in germantown md did not meet standards for 
scientific reliability 
in december prosecutors in maine were forced to withdraw dna 
evidence in a sexual assault case and drop charges 
defense experts testified there were flaws in procedures used by 
lifecodes corp of valhalla ny to match dna in the defendants 
blood with that extracted from a semen sample taken at the crime 
scene 
on march 8 a judge presiding over an oregon rape case refused 
to admit dna test results from the fbi lab ruling there was too 
much scientific controversy over the tests reliability and too 
much danger of confusing jurors with technical details 
spokesmen at the two commercial dna laboratories defended their 
procedures as did hicks 
hicks said computer imaging at the fbi lab ensures that a match 
is properly read by the tester in addition two examiners must 
find that the dna patterns match before positive results are 
declared he said 
michael baird director of forensic testing at lifecodes said 
the court decisions have not discredited the technique or the 
procedures track record 
we are talking about whether the approach itself is correct as 
opposed to whats being done in a particular case baird said 
there have been situations where portions of the evidence were 
not ruled admissible but the technology itself has been 
admissible 
the issue is not so much should it be accepted as evidence but 
how and under what circumstances said janlori goldman a staff 
attorney for the american civil liberties unions privacy project 
dna testing isnt exclusively a weapon for prosecutors 
of more than 500 tests completed by the fbi 36 percent excluded 
the suspect in question hicks said 
public defenders in washington commissioned dna tests that 
recently exonerated a man whose rape conviction was overturned 
because his dna did not match that taken from a semen stain found 
on the womans clothing 
thousands of other tests performed by cellmark and lifecodes 
have exonerated defendants or encouraged them to plead guilty said 
mark storolow a spokesman for cellmark 
as a form of evidence it must be very very powerful because 
it results in a lot of plea bargaining he said 
rape cases are the most common application of dna testing in 
criminal investigations because hospitals routinely take semen 
samples from victims 
the test can also be useful in solving murders enabling police 
to determine for example that blood on a suspects clothing was 
from the victim it also is used for paternity tests 
when it goes to the identity of the person thats when its 
particularly relevant said jay b stephens the us attorney in 
washington 
to check for a match scientists use enzymes to cut dna 
strands into small pieces and place them on laboratory gelatin the 
fragments move along the gelatin and form patterns similar to the 
pricecode bars on supermarket merchandise 
each person except for identical twins has a singular genetic 
makeup so the pattern should be unique 
based on the size of the test sample and data taken from dna 
tests drawn from samplings of the population scientists calculate 
the odds against a pattern being repeated 
neufeld and other lawyers argue that laboratories use 
lessthanobjective criteria for deciding that two dna patterns 
match 
in the maine case expert witnesses questioned the procedures 
lifecodes used to adjust for a phenomenon called bandshifting 
in which the fragments do not move evenly along the gelatin 
thomas caskey a medical professor who is starting a dna lab at 
baylor university in houston dismisses those who question the 
reliability of tests 
it is extremely easy to determine whether one has a match 
between the suspect and the forensic specimen he said 
but neufeld argues that like other scientific evidence dna 
should be subject to rigorous court scrutiny particularly if its 
used to determine if a person is going to prison

enter any bookstore and youll find walls of 
selfhelp manuals theyll save your marriage cure your phobia 
release the inner you or enable you to stick to the only diet 
youll ever need 
many of them make claims on the covers or jackets that the 
contents dont deliver and some use theories that have not been 
proved said psychologist gerald rosen who wants his fellow 
professionals to do something about that 
he suggests a kind of good housekeeping seal of approval from 
the american psychological association books would be required to 
state how methods had been tested on whom and how effective they 
were and now the market includes cassette tapes too 
we have to have these products marketed with accurate claims 
and not take advantage of the public said rosen who is in 
private practice in seattle and has written a selfhelp book of his 
own about phobias 
rosen had hoped to present a golden fleece award for 
selfhelp psychotherapies at the apas convention last august in 
new orleans to embarrass therapists who made exaggerated claims 
about untested programs he had planned to pass out noisemakers 
and make awards based on the level of honks and boos each book 
received 
but the apa nixed the idea 
very bad taste said charles spielberger apa president 
its not scientific evaluation people booing 
if an apa member writes a book that violates the organizations 
ethical principles and if someone files a claim the apa would 
investigate said spielberger a psychology professor at the 
university of south florida tampa 
we dont shrink for a minute from expelling or censuring a 
member who doesnt follow apa code said raymond fowler a 
psychologist and apa chief executive officer but you cant just 
let one member speak for the association and say heres a bad guy 
doing a bad job 
but apa may consider regulating member authors 
we will start a serious consideration of apas role in looking 
at selfhelp books and whether we need to develop a task 
force to draw up guidelines or inform our members of general 
standards fowler said recently 
the truth is i wouldnt want to underestimate some of these 
books they are very sound and very sensitively thought out said 
fowler and for some individuals it may be the only psychological 
help theyll obtain 
and evaluating every selfhelp book would be an enormous 
undertaking 
rosens book dont be afraid had its share of exaggerated 
claims he said and the experience taught him it would be possible 
for the apa to set up a standard contract for psychologists to 
negotiate control of book promotion 
one way to deal with book jacket hyperbole rosen said is for 
authors to take a tough stand with publishers but herbert holtje 
a literary agent said it is nearly impossible for writers to 
maintain that kind of control 
it is unrealistic that selfhelp books should be marketed 
without consideration of the competitive climate created by 
publishers holtje wrote in the journal american psychologist 
albert ellis president of the institute for rationalemotive 
therapy and a psychologist in new york city has written more than 
50 selfhelp books 
im critical of some selfhelp books but definitely in favor 
of others said ellis who would approve of a program to test a 
book for effectiveness but he said he doubts publishers would wait 
around for that 
i must say theres something frustrating about the hard work 
of research day in and day out just to get a little way and someone 
reels out a potboiler and makes thousands said patricia 
keithspiegel a professor of psychology at california state 
university at northridge who teaches a course in ethics 
she was on the apas ethics committee at a time when a 
psychologist couldnt give out professional advice except in a 
clientpatient relationship 
then everything exploded she said and psychologists were 
on radio and television they were writing columns they were 
writing books 
she is writing her own howto book how to get into graduate 
school 
ive been a vocal critic of selfhelp books keithspiegel 
said im going to have to research and check out everything i 
say 
rosen cites a number of books he feels exaggerate their claims 
one is the doctors guide to instant stress relief a 
psychological and medical system by psychologists ronald g 
nathan and thomas e staats and dr paul j rosch 
i dont believe theres any such thing as instant stress 
relief rosen said it could have been called the doctors 
guide to stress relief you can learn in a few weeks 
but nathan said the title was suggested by the publisher and 
agreed upon only after much discussion among the authors while it 
may take six months to learn the technique of instant relaxation 
it then can be applied in seconds he said 
one danger in selfhelp books is that people can misdiagnose 
themselves and fail to seek help rosen contends but nathan said 
he and his coauthors provided a test for the reader to determine 
if professional help is needed 
my pitch has been trying to convince psychology professionals 
that its time to take selfhelp books seriously because theyve 
set up an alternate therapy system and the books reach many more 
consumers than we will said steven starker chief of 
psychological services and professor of medical psychology at 
oregon health sciences university in portland ore 
he also made that point in an article debating the topic in the 
magazine american psychologist 
i have talked to a lot of people over the years who have found 
a great deal of help in selfhelp books said bernie zilbergeld 
a psychologist in private practice in oakland calif and 
coauthor of mind power getting what you want through mental 
training 
if they can go out and pay 5 for a paperback book and get 
help from it without seeing me why not zilbergeld said 
rosen admits he sounds selfserving he charges 95 for an hour 
of therapy but he said professionals should not promise the 
public more than they can deliver

a study of more than 12800 men bolsters research 
arguing that quitting smoking and eating lowfat foods can help 
lower the risk of heart disease 
the study published in the april 6 journal of the american 
medical association found that men at high risk for heart disease 
who were given dietary advice and other special treatment had a 24 
percent lower death rate from heart attacks than those who received 
ordinary care 
the death rate from heart disease was 106 percent lower and the 
overall death rate was 77 percent lower in the first group 
researchers found 
treatment consisted of advice to lower cholesterol levels 
counseling on quitting smoking and improved drug therapy to control 
high blood pressure 
about half the 12860 men studied at 22 clinics nationwide 
received the special treatment several times a year while the 
other half were examined annually and received additional treatment 
only if needed 
the study of men aged 35 to 57 began in late 1973 and ended in 
1982 the results reported in jama occurred between 1982 and a 
december 1985 followup review said marcus o kjelsberg a 
statistician at the university of minnesotas school of public 
health where the data was analyzed 
initial examinations in 1982 showed no significant differences 
between the groups which surprised researchers and prompted the 
followup kjelsberg said in a telephone interview 
the ultimate results were not surprising given the multitude of 
data showing a link between diet smoking and heart disease said 
jeremiah stamler a cardiovascular epidemiologist at northwestern 
university and a principal investigator in the study 
researchers expected to see the results earlier at the end of 
the study but they failed to anticipate several factors that may 
account for the delay stamler said 
one reason may have been that all the volunteers were relatively 
healthy despite facing a higher than normal risk for heart disease 
because they smoked had high blood pressure or high cholesterol 
levels or a combination of the three stamler said 
another reason for the delayed results may have been a change in 
drug treatment for high blood pressure that occurred toward the end 
of the study the later treatment was considered more effective 
kjelsberg said 
researchers did not determine how many of the men who had 
received special treatment continued to seek it after the study 
ended he said but they asssumed that many stuck to their 
healthier lifestyles 
the study was funded by the national heart lung and blood 
institute in bethesda md

pervasive fraud played a major role in the 
collapse of many savings and loans fbi director william sessions 
says but tracking down crime is difficult because of the complex 
nature of the institutions deals 
the types of cases we are seeing in texas frequently involve 
the looting of institutions for the direct financial benefit of 
officers directors or major stockholders he said 
sessions testified wednesday at a house banking committee 
hearing in dallas leading a parade of witnesses who blamed fraud 
for much of the thrift industrys problems 
although it was the general economic downturn in texas that 
surfaced the problem it appears to the fbi as if a pervasive 
pattern of fraudulent lending activity began much earlier he 
said 
experience demonstrates that insider abuse is a major factor 
in almost all of our investigations involving failed financial 
institutions sessions said 
the committee chaired by rep henry b gonzalez is holding two 
days of hearings in dallas to examine investigations of fraud in 
the industry the hearing was scheduled to continue today although 
at least three of the listed witnesses indicated they wouldnt show 
the committee has asked key figures at some of the most 
notorious failed thrifts to testify but only one thomas gaubert 
has indicated he will appear 
gaubert who has been acquitted once on fraud charges was 
chairman of independent american savings association the three 
others asked to testify were edwin t mcbirney former chairman at 
sunbelt savings association of texas don r dixon former owner of 
vernon savings and loan association and jarrett woods of western 
savings association 
all four institutions were recipients of multimillion dollar 
bailouts and have been targets of federal investigations 
this is not a problem that is limited to texas or even to the 
southwest sessions said more incidents of insider abuse have 
been identified in texas however because the texas institutions 
are coming under closer scrutiny as they are being declared 
insolvent 
in north texas alone sessions said regulators have 38 
separate savings and loans institutions identified wherein major 
conspiratorial fraud is alleged over 500 subjects have been 
identified for investigation and possible prosecution 
potential financial loss exposure is 105 billion he said 
gonzalez criticized the bush administration for being slow to 
implement regulations and safeguards adopted last year in bailout 
legislation 
we gave the regulatory and the law enforcement agencies 
unprecedented power to deal with the crisis and the cleanup 
gonzalez said but the administration left key jobs unfilled and 
failed to develop a sense of urgency 
the recovery machinery at the resolution trust corp creaks 
along like some old model t with many of its parts missing the 
biggest evidence of life and vigor has been the outlandish 
bureaucratic infighting that has paralyzed and driven away the 
better people gonzalez said 
the rtc is the agency charged with rescuing failed thrifts 
the american people judging from my mail and my telephone 
calls are angry about what they see as business as usual 
approach to a disaster that is costing them dearly gonzalez said 
sessions defended his agencys efforts recalling bank fraud 
investigations as far back as 1982 he said a shortage of resources 
and the complexity of the frauds had hampered the agencys work 
it is often difficult to distinguish failures that involve 
fraud from failures resulting from poor management and poor 
business decisions sessions said 
sessions said the fbi is investigating 530 failed institutions 
including 276 banks 234 savings and loans and 20 credit unions 
198 of the institutions including onethird of the thrift cases 
are in texas 
in addition sessions said the fbi has more than 3000 pending 
cases of traditional bank fraud and embezzlement involving 100000 
or more 
other witnesses who included former federal and state 
regulators and other officials testified about the regulatory 
climate in texas and in washington and said top officials and some 
congressmen refused to recognize the industrys problems in the mid 
1980s

the recent sharp fall in oil prices has 
prompted intense discussions among opec nations including the 
possibility of an emergency meeting by ministers analysts said 
there has been some contact among the ministers about the 
possibility of meeting to discuss the problem a source close to 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries said wednesday 
the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
opec spokesmen in vienna the groups headquarters said no 
meeting had been planned 
some doubted the ministers would gather so soon before their 
scheduled meeting in late may at that time all 13 ministers will 
set their production and pricing guidelines for the last half of 
the year 
but the source close to opec said the organizations 
eightmember monitoring panel could meet in a special session to 
discuss the price declines or that an even smaller group could 
hold informal talks 
there are intense discussions he said 
a fall in prices had been expected in the oftenweak second 
quarter but the sharpness in recent days has been startling 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude fell 
by some 25 percent in the past 11 weeks on wednesday the 
nearmonth contract dropped below 17 a barrel at one point on the 
new york mercantile exchange before rebounding strongly to finish 
up 38 cents at 1806 a barrel 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
was 1712 a barrel in the first week of april off from 1726 in 
the last week of march and below the cartels 18 a barrel target 
price 
analysts blamed the price drop on overproduction by some opec 
members and seasonally lower demand by the united states and other 
consuming nations in the apriljune quarter 
peter gignoux director of the international energy department 
at shearson lehman hutton in london estimated the cartels 
production last week at just over 245 million barrels a day well 
over opecs cap of 221 million barrels a day for the januaryjune 
period 
peter bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris said its the spring 
weakness everybody has been talking about demand is down 
because its always down at this time of year 
he predicted prices could fall further in the nearterm before 
firming in june when demand for gasoline picks up with the summer 
driving season in the united states and elsewhere 
in a report last week the international energy agency said opec 
pumped about 237 million barrels a day in march the same as in 
the previous month

ford motor co is throwing in the towel in its 
truck advertising battle with chevrolet but theres a string 
attached 
ford which has dominated truck sales for more than a dozen 
years will stop using comparison advertising in its new round of 
truck ads advertising manager john vanderzee said wednesday 
but the new series of ads which debut this month can be 
changed easily to insert a chevrolet or two if the company feels it 
has to he said 
it is a major new direction for us resulting from customer 
research vanderzee said we are not interested in advertising 
wars anymore 
were not going to take on chevrolet anymore 
chevrolet has no immediate plans to drop its current run of 
comparison ads said dave hudgens a spokesman for the general 
motors corp division 
i do know that the truck advertising people in particular 
felt that they were very effective hudgens said if you have 
something thats very effective it makes sense to continue with 
it 
ford and chevrolet have taken each other on with pointed and 
sometimes snippy advertisements 
chevys ditch of doom ad showed a chevrolet pickup plowing 
through a muddy trench while occupants of a ford truck jumped into 
the muck to manually lock front wheels and make their truck a 
fourwheeldrive vehicle 
chevrolet claimed in a later advertisement that its trucks 
outsold ford trucks in ford county ill 
ford fired back with an ad acknowledging that chevrolet outsold 
it in one month by one truck the ad said ford outsold chevrolet 
for the entire year in ford county and for extra measure in chevy 
chase md 
through march 31 this year ford sold 108 percent more light 
trucks than chevrolet 352469 to 318247 and for the first half 
of the 1990 model year fords trucks sold at a pace 131 percent 
faster than chevys 
were gaining ground on them theyre not gaining ground on 
us vanderzee said 
fords ads responding to chevys were endorsed by dealers 
vanderzee said ford officials have been on a 33city dealer tour 
during the past month telling dealers among other things about 
the new truck advertising 
cecil davis general sales manager at coliseum ford in portland 
ore said he liked the comparison ads 
i always thought it was a good case they were making he 
said if it was one way or another i would wish they would keep 
the comparison ads 
while telling dealers that the corporations ads wont show 
comparisons with chevrolet vanderzee said some dealers may not be 
able to resist it in local advertising 
if they want to take on chevrolet or toyota in their market 
they are going to do it vanderzee said we may say that we 
dont like it

shell oil co is joining other oil companies in 
pumping a new gasoline that reduces hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide 
emissions 
shells gas called su 2000e was put on the market in the nine 
metropolitan areas the bush administration has identified as having 
the most severe air quality problems said frank h richardson 
shells president and chief executive officer 
we think this new product from shell represents an important 
step toward improving the nations air quality richardson said 
wednesday 
the gas is being sold in the areas of new york city chicago 
houston los angeles philadelphia baltimore milwaukee san diego 
and hartford conn 
it also is available in the washington dc area which was 
targeted as having a serious not a severe air quality problem 
houstonbased shell said it may expand production in the future 
other oil companies that have introduced reformulated gasolines 
include arco phillips petroleum marathon exxon amoco mobil 
citgo and sun oil those companies generally are selling the new 
gasoline in limited test markets 
more than 2000 shell stations are selling the gas which can be 
used in virtually any car the new gas has the same octane number 
and additive package as shells su 2000 premium gas which it has 
replaced in the 10 targeted areas 
we obviously do not view our introduction of su 2000e as a 
total solution to the nations air quality problems we do believe 
that it is an important step in the right direction richardson 
said 
the new gasoline reduces hydrocarbon vapor emissions a 
component in smog formation and carbon monoxide emissions from 
automobile tailpipes shell officials said 
steven l miller president of shell refining and marketing co 
said the carbon monoxide emissions are reduced because the gas 
contains methyl tertiarybutyl ether or mtbe 
mtbe replaces butane which results in a gasoline with a lower 
vapor pressure that evaporates less quickly 
by reducing the vapor pressure of gasoline we reduce the 
pounds of hydrocarbons that escape into the atmosphere through 
evaporation he said 
richardson said if all of shells premium gas customers in the 
targeted areas used the new gas there will be about 80 fewer tons 
of emissions to the air during a typical summer day about 37 
million gallons of premium gas are sold on an average summer day in 
the 10 areas 
the gas costs about 2 cents more per gallon to produce than 
other premium gasolines shell officials said the new gas is priced 
the same as su 2000 but they added the future price will be 
determined by competitive conditions in the marketplace

an 11month declining trend in japans trade 
surplus halted in march but economists said it was because the 
months imports were being compared with an unusually large amount 
of imports in march 1989 
the finance ministry on thursday reported a surplus of 709 
billion in march up from 661 billion in march a year earlier in 
each of the 11 previous months the surplus had been smaller than 
the ones the prior year 
in february the surplus had fallen to 501 billion from 723 
billion in february 1989 
for japans fiscal year which ended march 31 the surplus 
measured when goods pass through customs fell to 597 billion 
from 789 billion the prior year the ministry reported 
in trade with the united states which has been pressing japan 
in a series of talks to narrow the imbalance the march surplus 
contracted to 377 billion from 401 billion in march 1989 
for the fiscal year japans sales to the united states exceeded 
us sales here by 428 billion down 127 percent from the 49 
billion surplus the year before 
on a global basis japans exports in march fell 18 percent 
from the previous year to 26 billion but imports declined 48 
percent to 189 billion 
in march 1989 imports had climbed nearly 30 percent from the 
previous year said toshiaki kakimoto chief economist with 
sumitomo bank there was a surge of buying before japan imposed a 
new 3 percent sales tax last april 1 he said 
meanwhile the us dollars recent increase against the yen 
makes japans exports measured in dollars appear bigger 
in march the finance ministry used exchange rates of about 148 
yen to one dollar to calculate exports and imports up from about 
128 yen a year earlier 
theres no big change in the downward trend of the japanese 
surplus said jan vandenberg an economist with merrill lynch in 
tokyo 
but she said that in coming months a combination of weaker 
demand in japan stronger demand abroad and the weak yen will cause 
japans trade surplus to begin expanding again 
kakimoto predicted a surplus of about 60 billion in the current 
fiscal year compared with 597 billion in fiscal 1989

pennsylvania is ready to adopt the 
nations toughest antitakeover law despite an outcry from the 
nations investment community and securities regulators 
lawmakers and gov robert p casey are standing behind the 
measure despite claims by fund managers that it will cut off 
pennsylvania companies from investment and that hostile takeovers 
are dying out for lack of financing 
the bill is an overreaction to a problem that is pretty much 
in its final stages said charles m laloggia editor of 
laloggias special situation report a newsletter on takeover 
stocks 
its sort of like the keystone kops arriving at the scene of a 
crime about a month late he added 
the measure is supported by a laborbusiness coalition that says 
it will protect the states business and jobs from corporate 
raiders 
the bill likely will come to a final vote in the state senate by 
the end of april it cleared the house april 3 by a 18210 vote 
and the senate approved an earlier version in december by 454 
casey says he backs the bill 
he is very strong in his support of legislation that would 
prevent raids on pennsylvania companies and jobs said caseys 
spokesman vincent carocci 
fund managers have lobbied against the bill since its 
introduction last year and they won a key ally last week in 
richard c breeden chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission 
breeden denounced the bill in an april 2 speech saying it would 
deny shareholders their rights and allow bad managers to run a 
company into the ground 
he said pennsylvania indiana and other states are trying to 
tilt the balance of corporate power in favor of corporate 
management and against shareholders 
hostile takeovers have cost pennsylvania thousands of jobs and 
the loss of such corporate mainstays as gulf oil co which closed 
its pittsburgh headquarters after it was merged with chevron oil 
the state ranks ranks fourth in the number of fortune 500 company 
headquarters 
the aflcio estimates about 90000 jobs were lost around the 
nation over the last decade because of mergers takeovers and 
leveraged buyouts 
but laloggia said the market already is correcting past abuses 
the excesses of corporate raiders have made it almost 
impossible to raise money in the junk bond market and the banking 
system for the type of leveraged buyout that caused companies to 
get into trouble he said 
those arguments hold little sway with the bills sponsor sen 
noah wenger 
this is precisely the time to move ahead he said the law 
also will be a model for other states wenger adds 
pennsylvania already has some of the nations toughest 
antitakeover laws in 1983 and 1988 the state adopted measures to 
block creeping tender offers twotiered offers and efforts to 
squeeze out minority shareholders in order to finance takeovers 
with corporation assets 
the push for even stronger sanctions started after the belzberg 
family of canada started buying into armstrong world industries 
inc a lancaster pabased building products manufacturer 
the belzbergs now own a 1068 percent stake in the 25 
billionayear company and are waging a proxy fight to elect four 
candidates to the 14member board at the companys april 30 annual 
meeting 
a key plank of the bill that has sent opponents into a frenzy is 
a socalled disgorgement section 
for the first time in the nation the measure would require 
corporate raiders to surrender profits earned by selling shares 
within 18 months of making a takeover bid supporters say the 
section will prevent the payment of greenmail the practice of 
buying back stock from a raider at an abovemarket price 
also under the bill raiders who gain 20 percent or more of a 
company would not get voting rights until approved by other 
shareholders opponents contend this stipulation will make it 
virtually impossible to wage proxy fights 
the bill also would allow company directors to act in the 
interest of the entire corporation and to consider interests other 
than those of shareholders in assessing takeover offers such 
interests could include a takeovers impact on employees customers 
or the community opponents say that would violate managements 
fiduciary duty to stockholders 
in provisions supported by organized labor the bill spells out 
that employees must be paid severance and that labor contracts must 
be honored when corporate ownership changes hands 
more than half the states have enacted takeover laws but 
indiana is the only other state that allows managers to play down 
shareholders interests said james e heard managing director of 
the analysis group a massachusettsbased financial consultant 
retained by the belzbergs 
about half the states also have limited restrictions on voting 
rights for acquisitions of large stakes but they are not as broad 
as those proposed for pennsylvania heard added

officials at greyhound lines inc say traffic 
during the fiveday easter travel period will solidify the 
companys financial position despite a 5weekold violencemarred 
strike by bus drivers 
greyhound president frank schmieder said in an interview this 
week that company projections indicate revenue will reach 70 
percent to 73 percent of last years easter holiday travel period 
he added that 73 percent of revenue is the breakeven mark 
and when we do that we figure weve turned the corner 
theyve been claiming they turned corners for the last six 
weeks said jeffrey nelson spokesman for the amalgamated council 
of greyhound local unions 
the companys 6300 drivers and about 3000 of its office and 
maintenance workers walked out marc 2 in an argument over wages and 
job security greyhound has been operating a reduced schedule 
using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket 
lines 
greyhound has increased service in stages today when the 
company plans to add more than 100000 miles putting it at 459685 
miles or 719 percent of prestrike levels 
union officials claim greyhound is operating only about 20 
percent of its prestrike routes 
negotiations to end the strike have been stalled since last 
month the company has refused to bargain until seven days have 
passed without major violence more than 30 shooting attacks have 
been reported since the strike began 
the company filed a 30 million federal lawsuit earlier this 
week charging the union was behind the violence the union claims 
the company is using the violence as an excuse to avoid 
negotiations 
authorities stopped three buses in northern ohio on wednesday 
after a man called greyhounds tollfree phone line claiming a bomb 
was planted on a bus heading east from chicago no explosives were 
found on the buses said thomas johnston of the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms office in toledo 
in pittsburgh a driver and passengers reported an explosion 
aboard a bus bound for washington dc about 20 minutes after a 
firecracker shattered a window at the pittsburgh terminal no one 
was injured in either incident said kevin fry a greyhound 
spokesman in dallas 
the bus carrying 31 passengers was on interstate 376 when 
both the driver and passengers heard and felt a vibration which 
they took to be an explosion greyhound spokeswoman bernadette 
barney said today she said the bus returned to the station and 
neither police nor the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms could immediately determine what caused the explosion 
which caused no damage to the bus 
two striking greyhound drivers were ordered held without bond on 
charges they fired shots at a bus last month just east of st louis 
through easter greyhound is offering free tickets if its buses 
are late in the busy northeast where service has been hardest hit 
schmieder said the promotion had been taken up by 800 passengers 
during the first five days of the offer 
passenger volumes nationwide totaled more than 56 percent of 
last years level according to company figures 
p anthony lannie greyhounds executive vice president said 
the company should be serving 95 percent of its routes by summer 
greyhound will have 3200 drivers by may 1 but will need at least 
1000 more to meet summer demand he said 
while passenger traffic may be growing the company is missing 
out on money from its small package express business which 
accounted for about 92 million of greyhounds 104 billion in 
revenue last year 
schmieder said the package business is at about 45 percent of 
yearearlier levels greyhounds charter operation which last year 
brought in 90 million has been almost nonexistent during the 
strike despite the reductions in service greyhound is meeting its 
bill payments schmieder said

federal regulators arbitrarily devalued the 
assests of the lincoln savings and loan association by 50 percent 
to 100 percent to justify their takeover of the institution the 
thrifts former owner contends 
without any analysis they took the entire loan portfolio and 
said it was nonperforming phoenix financier charles h keating 
jr testified wednesday in his suit to regain ownership of the 
irvine calif sampl 
the devaluation of lincolns loans and extensive land hotel and 
stock holdings was absurd keating said in his fifth day on the 
witness stand 
a government document dated april 21 1989 and introduced 
wednesday lists assumptions used in the liquidating costing to 
come up with a cost to taxpayers of 18 billion to 22 billion 
he contended the document from regional regulators to the 
federal home loan bank board supports his claim that regulators 
arbitrarily devalued lincolns assets to make it appear insolvent 
to justify their seizing it 
on tuesday keating testified that in his opinion lincoln had 
a net worth of 500 million to 700 million when the government 
seized it 
the april 21 document was written one week after regulators 
seized control of the 52 billion thrift under a conservatorship 
claiming that keating was operating it in an unsafe and unsound 
manner 
it wasnt until five months later that regulators declared 
lincoln insolvent with liabilities to federally insured 
depositors exceeding its assets by 153 million and took 
ownership away from keating under a receivership 
government attorneys repeatedly objected to keatings comparison 
of figures in the regulators april 21 analysis with those provided 
by the chief financial officer of his american continental corp 
lincolns parent holding company 
the objections were overruled by us district judge stanley 
sporkin who previously instructed the government attorneys to call 
witnesses from the federal deposit insurance corp lincolns 
receiver to explain their reasoning behind the writedowns 
this is something that has some meaning said sporkin a 
former accountant and once the top enforcement officer at the 
securities and exchange commission the testimony here is that it 
the april 21 analysis is pretty shoddy work you dont write down 
50 percent on a mortgage portfolio 
robert wurzelbacher keatings soninlaw who headed lincolns 
real estate investments likened the analysis to a family buying a 
100000 home with a 20000 down payment and an 80000 loan 
then a regulator comes in and says the value of the loan and the 
home is only 40000 even though the monthly payments are still 
being made he said 
the april 21 document estimated that the government could 
recover only 21 billion to 25 billion from the sale of assets 
that lincoln was listing on its books as worth 52 billion when 
regulators seized control 
assuring no losses to depositors would cost the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp which has since been merged into the 
fdic 18 billion to 22 billion according to the analysis 
among the assumptions listed were that lincolns entire 14 
billion portfolio of mortgagebacked real estate loans was 
nonperforming and in reality was worth only 703 million 
it also estimated that 148 million in property that lincoln had 
repossessed under foreclosure could be sold for only 74 million 
and that only 355 million of 711 million in nonmortgage 
commercial loans could ever be recovered 
in addition the government said 75 percent or 533 million of 
the 710 million that lincoln invested through subsidiaries in 
stock hotels and various land holdings could never be recovered 
some assets were devalued by 100 percent including longterm 
leases and property improvements on lincoln in southern california 
and some office equipment and furniture 
keating testified that 3 percent of the 14 billion in land and 
real estate loans and less than 3 percent of the commercial loans 
were more than 60 days in default when regulators seized lincoln 
all of the land and real estate loans he said were fully 
secured with borrowers putting up an average 20 percent down 
payment on the property 
lincolns 20 percent ownership in the timber rights on 19 
million acres of timberland in the pacific northwest and louisiana 
alone were valued at about 270 million according to an analysis 
by merrill lynch keating said

grain and soybean futures prices were slightly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade partly 
due to positionsquaring by traders ahead of the threeday easter 
weekend beginning friday 
analysts linked further selling to prospects for increased 
soybean meal exports from brazil the worlds second largest 
soybean producer as the south american soybean harvest approaches 
50 percent 
another bearish factor was the brazilian legislatures approval 
of certain inflationfighting measures that are expected to prompt 
brazilian farmers to sell more soybeans analysts said 
brazils government hopes to hold inflation to 5 percent this 
month compared with more than 80 percent in march which leaves 
very little incentive for producers to hold onto inventory said 
william biedermann director of research at the commodities 
brokerage allendale inc in crystal lake ill 
weakness in the wheat market partly reflected reports of minimal 
frost damage overnight to the winter wheat crop 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 1 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in may at 363 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with may at 270 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to cent lower with may at 151 a bushel soybeans were 
cent to 1 cents lower with may at 591 a bushel

energy futures prices mostly were higher in 
seesaw trading today after breaking a weeklong slump with some 
modest gains in the previous session 
prices had declined early in the session but recovered the days 
lost ground and more by midday 
the erratic performance came in the wake of official 
confirmation that opec oil ministers were considering calling an 
emergency meeting to deal with conditions that have seen crude oil 
futures prices fall 25 percent since january 
wednesdays gains came in one of the wildest sessions of the 
year as prices rocketed higher in the afternoon on speculation 
that opec nations were considering calling an emergency meeting 
prices had fallen sharply to start wednesdays session in what 
analysts said reflected concerns about the huge supply of crude and 
weak demand 
in london today opecs acting president sadek boussena said 
opec oil ministers are considering various options including 
calling an emergency meeting to try and stop the recent slide in 
world oil prices 
on the new york mercantile exchange at midday the may contract 
for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
was up 9 cents at 1815 a barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange it had been down 44 cents at midmorning after rising 38 
cents on wednesday 
among refined products traded on the merc the contract for may 
delivery of unleaded gasoline was off 008 cent at 5950 cents a 
gallon after rising 115 cents on wednesday 
may home heating oil was up 047 cent to 5410 cents a gallon in 
early trading after rising 123 cents on wednesday 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery was trading at 1597 
per million british thermal units down from 1605 on wednesday 
analysts said the early price declines on wednesday reflected 
the american petroleum institutes report released after the 
market closed tuesday that us crude oil inventories rose by a 
largerthanexpected 81 million barrels last week 
but prices rebounded sharply later in the session after rumors 
circulated that opec nations were consulting by telephone and 
considering calling an emergency meeting about the decline 
spokesmen for the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
at the groups headquarters in vienna said no meeting had been 
planned 
analysts say opec has been producing more crude oil than the 
market can absorb in recent weeks causing prices to decline since 
late january 
it has been estimated that the opec nations have been producing 
between 235 million and 241 million barrels a day of crude oil 
topping its selfimposed cap of 221 million barrels 
the only thing that can turn this market around would be 
opec said james r fiedler a vice president at edampf man 
international futures inc 
crude oil prices have plunged 25 percent since the nearmonth 
contract for west texas intermediate reached 2420 a barrel on 
jan 22 the decline had accelerated in recent days with the may 
crude oil contract losing 147 a barrel in this weeks first two 
sessions alone sinking to the lowest level for a nearmonth 
contract since february 1989 
despite the big decline in crude futures motorists havent seen 
lower prices at the pump 
the national average price for a gallon of gasoline was 11331 
a gallon on april 6 according to the latest lundberg survey of 
13000 gasoline stations nationwide that compared with an average 
11306 on jan 19 
analysts say there often is a lag of a month to 45 days for 
refined products to reflect movements in futures prices in 
addition they say gasoline prices normally rise as the spring 
driving season approaches and refiners this year are incurring 
extra costs in meeting tougher antismog regulations for their 
products 
demand for crude oil normally falls off in the early spring and 
refineries often take the opportunity to close their plants for 
maintenance 
but this spring inventories already were high because of an 
unusually mild winter in europe and the united states according to 
bob baker who tracks the oil markets for prudentialbache 
securities inc 
demand also appears to be weaker than a year ago peter beutel 
assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc 
estimated demand for gasoline is down 12 percent from a year ago 
while demand for heating oil fell 85 percent 
part of the decline beutel said may stem from a general 
weakening in economic activity

in one form or another you can perceive a 
growing hope among americans that whatever power it is that pushes 
the economic pedals and levers knows what it is doing 
the mutual concern arising from consumers and producers 
employers and workers academics and the man and woman about town 
is that the economy is beginning to sound like an old poorly 
maintained car 
theres a lot of coughing and sputtering to be heard a good 
deal of deterioration to be seen and a sense that there isnt 
enough wherewithal to replace the old buggy 
whos in charge 
theoretically at least economic policy is made up of fiscal 
and monetary actions the first being the responsibility of 
congress and the white house the latter mainly being a function of 
the federal reserve 
of the two the impact of fiscal policy tends to be 
sloweracting than monetary policy it involves taxing public 
spending and budgets for example while monetary policy involves 
money supply and interest rates 
interest rates remain fairly high by standards in comparable 
times of the past three or four decades action by the fed to lower 
them could spur activity but so far that body has not deemed such 
action appropriate 
still manufacturing is sluggish the economic index by the 
nations purchasing managers association rose slightly in february 
but it remained below 50 for the 11th month in a row below 50 
generally is seen as negative and portending contraction 
similarly the jobless rate essentially was unchanged in march 
with the civilian unemployment rate remaining around 52 percent of 
the labor force it might have looked good in headlines but finer 
print didnt read well 
why did the jobless rate remain steady good weather rather 
than improving business resulted in fewer layoffs federal 
government hiring of census workers helped it will help in april 
too when 200000 will be added 
but a disturbing story was contained in the march data the 
number of factory jobs declined by 30000 bringing the 
manufacturing job loss to about 100000 since last november over a 
year such jobs are down by 250000 
singlefamily home sales rose 3 percent in february but that 
report also wasnt as good as hoped for the national association 
of home builders had expected mild weather and some mortgage rate 
declines to produce better news 
the year 1990 is stacking up as a weaker year than we expected 
only a few months ago said nahb president martin perlman 
over the 12 months ended in february the index of leading 
economic indicators was down 1 percent one of the worst 
yeartoyear reports since the mid1980s consumer spending is 
weak production readings too 
not easily measured but certainly not adding to economic 
confidence are various news items including the everworsening 
savings and loan losses poor real estate markets in some areas 
and the problems with junk bonds 
once upon a time many times the federal government would 
step in and throw money around like confetti to fuel greater 
growth but governments at all levels are hurting these days and 
they have little money to give 
an apparently positive signal flashed a few days ago with 
reports that us companies would maintain their capital spending 
programs for new plants and equipment but that report is being 
questioned because profits are falling 
with effort it often is possible to assemble a handbasket of 
bad economic news like this and attempt to convince people that 
things are going to hades but to do so in recent weeks takes no 
effort at all 
perhaps the most optimistic aspect of the situation is that it 
isnt new several times in the past few years the long economic 
expansion seemed to be at an end the old buggy coughed and 
sputtered but then it didnt expire 
and now with springtime here maybe it can find a few more 
miles in its worn machinery especially if the federal reserve 
greases the gears with a shot of lower interest rates

intel corp said thursday its 
firstquarter profit jumped 48 percent due in part to increased 
demand for the companys 32bit computer microprocessors 
profit for the quarter ended march 31 totaled 144 million or 
73 cents a share compared with 97 million or 52 cents a share 
in the same period a year ago 
revenue for the quarter totaled 894 million up 25 percent from 
713 million in the same quarter last year 
the transition to 32bit computer architectures has picked 
up momentum in the past six months said andrew s grove 
president and chief executive officer of the santa clarabased 
company 
intels new 386 and 486 microprocessors process information 32 
bits at a time rather than 16 bits under their original design a 
bit is the smallest piece of information used by a computer the 
increase expands microprocessor power capabilities and speed said 
intel spokeswoman karen nalley 
grove predicted continued market demand and growth for intel 
products in the current quarter 
intel has announced plans to upgrade or expand manufacturing 
capacity at several of its plants with capital expenditures for 
the year estimated at 600 million 
in december the company announced it was phasing out its last 
chip plant in silicon valley and moving production operations to 
other locations such as arizona oregon and new mexico where there 
is more affordable housing 
intel also said last year it is spending 400 million to build a 
plant near dublin ireland 
the company in january announced a joint venture with nmb 
semiconductor ltd of japan to sell nmbs dynamic randomaccess 
memory or dram chips worldwide on an exclusive basis 
intel used to manufacture drams a vital ingredient in many 
electronic products but quit in 1985 when japanese companies 
started making them in large quantities and selling them at low 
prices

the decline of hostile takeovers may have 
restored a measure of calm to the boardrooms of us corporations 
but that doesnt mean directors and managers are enjoying peace and 
quiet 
their biggest shareholders institutional investors such as 
publicemployee pension funds that once endorsed nearly everything 
corporate executives said or did have become increasingly vocal 
and more demanding 
they are increasingly sponsoring resolutions at annual meetings 
for example on subjects ranging from shareholder proxyvoting 
rights to policies on the environment and south africa much to the 
chagrin of top executives some big investors have muscled their 
way into corporate decisionmaking 
were seeing companies voluntarily agreeing to institute 
confidentiality in proxy votesand occidental petroleum agreed 
to meet with institutional investors on an informal basis gray 
davis californias comptroller and a trustee of the states public 
employee pension funds said in citing examples of the 
institutions evolving power 
perhaps the biggest coup scored by institutional investors came 
last month at lockheed corps annual meeting when the big 
stockholders forced management to make some substantial concessions 
or risk losing their support in a proxy vote instigated by 
dissident investor harold simmons 
lockheed chairman daniel tellep met with 70 institutions in his 
defense against simmons campaign to unseat his companys board 
among the concessions tellep made was an agreement to name up to 
three lockheed directors to represent institutional shareholders 
he convinced me that he has finally got religion davis said 
of tellep he said the last three months of his life have been 
the most educational of his career 
davis said the institutions victory with lockheed will open 
doors at other corporations that sell stock to the public 
management is increasingly affording institutional investors an 
opportunity to make constructive suggestions he said 
institutional investors are trying to do what any investor wants 
to do make a profit the price of the stock they hold must be at 
or above a certain level or the value of assets needed to fund 
thousands of pensions will fall 
for example if a pension fund held 1 million shares of a 
companys stock and the stock fell 10 million over the course of a 
year the funds assets would be worth 10 million less than a year 
earlier that means theres less money to fund retirees pensions 
lockheeds stock reached a high of 5475 a share during the 
last 12 months but fell to 3662 by march 29 the day of the 
companys annual meeting for california public employees 
retirement system one of the funds of which davis is a trustee 
the 18ashare drop meant a decline of more than 9 million in its 
assets 
the stocks of other defense contractors also have fallen 
recently but the institutions and other shareholders including 
simmons have been dissatisfied with the companys management and 
linked its policies directly to the decline in lockheeds stock 
price 
if theyre so unhappy why dont they just sell their stock 
they cant at least not in one fell swoop with their massive 
holdings institutions cant unload an underperforming stock 
without affecting the rest of the market 
recently the california new york city and massachusetts 
pension funds jointly sought assurances from exxon corp that the 
oil giant would protect its earnings and therefore its stock 
price by taking steps to prevent another disaster like last 
years exxon valdez spill the funds said they approached the 
company because they couldnt just dump their combined holdings of 
14 million exxon shares 
todd lang a partner with the law firm weil gotshal amp manges 
said institutions are more active because they are forced to hold 
onto their shares 
institutional investors have a responsibility to their 
beneficiaries to seek changes or to vote independentlyso they 
develop voting positions on everything lang said 
many big companies have resisted institutions attempts to take 
a larger role in corporate governance when the california public 
employees fund and the new york state and local retirement system 
recently asked general motors corp for updates on the search for a 
successor to retiring chairman roger smith for example they were 
told to butt out 
corporate governance which includes the selection of 
officers is the boards responsibility gm said in a statement 
last year exxon named an environmentalist to its board in 
response to a request by new york citys employee pension fund but 
the request came less than two months after the exxon valdez 
accident the oil company fighting criticism about its 
environmental record was in no position to refuse 
despite the institutions recent gains some pension fund 
executives say there is still much work to be done 
roland m machold director of new jerseys investment division 
sees institutional holders as largely powerless although they hold 
40 percent to 50 percent of all outstanding stock 
he attributed much of the successes institutional holders had 
with lockheed to the threat generated by simmons one of the few 
takeover strategists who has remained relatively active in recent 
months 
certainly we have made our presence known but companies have 
tried to close the door on shareholder activity he said 
nonetheless investor relations consultants are warning 
management that institutional investors will be rocking the boat 
harder and told them this will be increasingly evident at annual 
meetings dale gerboth a partner at the accounting and consulting 
firm ernst amp young told companies recently institutional 
investors are acting more like owners 
machold and davis are two of three cochairmen of the council of 
institutional investors an association of employee benefit plans 
state and local agencies that oversee such plans and 
notforprofit foundations and endowments the council has become 
an advocate for shareholder rights in the belief that more powerful 
investors can help effect changes that will benefit all 
stockholders 
the council backs a set of proposals known as the shareholders 
bill of rights which among other things includes the principle of 
oneshare onevote and calls for shareholders to have a voice in 
matters that would have significant financial impact on a company 
institutional investors are also opposing some classic takeover 
defenses including antitakeover laws and poison pill plans 
which could limit their ability to receive a higher price for their 
shares in a buyout 
some have actively pressured companies to rescind corporate 
policies that award multimillion dollar golden parachute 
severance packages to executives if theyre dismissed 
californias funds have also been active on their own 
submitting to the securities and exchange commission proposed 
revisions on proxy solicitation rules 
we believe shareholders and employees should be afforded the 
opportunity to make constructive suggestions to management the 
proxy rules as presently constituted dont really afford 
shareholders that opportunity davis said 
our goal is a more level playing field he said under 
current law management has the upper hand

president bush and his wife barbara reported 
208274 last year from business holdings kept in a blind trust and 
paid total federal income taxes of 101382 according to a copy of 
the first familys tax return released today 
the bushes reported a total gross adjusted income of 456780 
for the year which includes the income from the blind trust and 
bushs government salary of 189167 
the job of president pays 200000 a year but bush was only 
president for just over 11 months and vice president for 20 days in 
1989 
the joint tax return filed by the president and his wife listed 
94702 in itemized deductions 
among the contributions was 3000 in cash for relief 
organizations to help victims of hurricane hugo in the virgin 
island and another 1500 for similar efforts in the aftermath of 
the san franciscoarea earthquake 
bush also reported profits of 14282 in 1989 on his campaign 
biography looking forward he divided all the proceeds between 
two charities the united negro college fund in new york and the 
md anderson cancer center of houston 
the bushs paid taxes equivalent to 222 percent of their total 
income 
in addition to his rise in slary in going from the job of vice 
president to the presidency the blind trust bush set up in 1981 
when he became vice president showed a profitable year 
the 208274 in interest and dividend earnings through 
partnerships and other ventures masked by the blind trust was up 
from 155662 reported in the previous year 
meanwhile vice president dan quayle and his wife marilyn 
reported that they paid total taxes of 25479 on adjusted gross 
income of 133696 most of the income consisted of quayles 
government salary 106528 as vice president and 3715 in 
january 1989 during the governmental transition period 
the quayles reported 14572 in dividend earnings in 1989 on 
stock holdings in central newspapers inc 
bush who has lobbied long and hard for a reduction on the 
capital gains tax wound up paying taxes on a longterm capital 
gain of 36068 in his income bracket the capital gains tax is 28 
percent under his proposal it would be just under 20 percent 
the gain was reported by the blind trust therefore the nature 
of it was not revealed the capital gains tax applies to profits 
from the sale of stock real estate or other assets 
overall the bushes claimed 94702 in itemized deductions 
including the 37272 they gave in contributions to 39 charities 
the blind trust also gave 594 to unspecified charities 
like many americans the amount withheld from bushs paycheck

quite cover the tax bill so the bushes had to send off a check to 
the irs regional office in philadelphia of 3228

matt fisher is the family risk taker known to delay paying the 
electric bill until the disconnect notice comes while his wife 
barbara is a virtuoso at balancing the checkbook 
fisher 34 feels reasonably comfortable with things like 
corporate bonds or growth stocks mrs fisher 42 gets uneasy at 
the mention of those words 
still the jacksonville fla couple who recently opened a 
hairreplacement business mix love and money successfully they 
keep half their 200000 investment portfolio in stocks and bonds 
and the rest in shortterm certificates of deposit or money market 
accounts neither makes an investment decision without the other 
they say 
for every couple like the fishers however there are several 
more that fail to jointly plan or even discuss important personal 
financial matters experts say part of the problem is that a large 
number of women have been slow in gaining equality in the home when 
it comes to money 
even though women have emerged from the money decade of the 80s 
as the fastest growing part of the work force their role in 
shaping the familys financial future remains stuck in a bygone 
world some investment planners say 
women are still in a very transitional role in which a man 
makes the investment decisions said marilyn cohen a principal 
of capital insight inc of beverly hills calif i dont find the 
young urban professional woman any more interested in money and 
investing than her mother who had a traditional housewife role i 
find it very distressing 
michael stein a financial planner with brownson rehmus amp 
foxworth in chicago said he also has encountered apathy in many of 
the working women among his married clients largely comprised of 
wealthy middleaged executives 
while the wives may be more likely to manage daytoday family 
finances like balancing the checkbook and paying household bills 
the husbands usually have the upper hand in making the major 
financial decisions he said 
often where you have two executive unitsthe husband still 
tends to be the dominant one stein said a dominating woman is 
the exception more than the rule 
not surprisingly couples financial concerns vary with age 
investment counselors say a younger couple likely will be more 
concerned with making house payments and accumulating wealth than a 
middleaged pair which is starting to think about retirement or 
paying off a childs college loan 
victoria feltoncollins a financial planner and psychologist 
with offices in california said money values start between the 
ages of 4 and 12 many americans she said have trouble shedding 
the traditional malefemale roles ingrained in their past 
regardless of economic changes 
both men and women are in fact perpetuating this said 
feltoncollins who wrote the recently published book couples amp 
money 
ive seen very successful women who go home and turn their 
paychecks over to their husbands they may manage millions of 
dollars for their companies but when they get home its a different 
story 
that relationship however is slowly changing as women continue 
to enter the work force and gain greater financial confidence 
feltoncollins said she expects that to continue through the 90s 
maybe its going to take another generation the daughters of 
these young urban professional women said cohenthey see their 
working mothers bringing home paychecks 
about 60 percent of all women of working age are employed 
outside the home and by the year 2000 women are expected to 
comprise about half of the nations total work force 
fulltime women workers are making more than they once did and 
some nearly bring home as much as their spouses still only one in 
six married women working fulltime brings home more money than her 
husband a figure that has remained constant for a decade census 
bureau figures show that on average women still only earn about 65 
percent of their husbands income 
eileen sharkey who runs the denver financial planning service 
sharkey amp associates inc said that in her practice she has seen 
more women taking an active role in finances over the past 10 years 
but she said i dont think theres ever going to be equality 
in terms of interest there will always be men who wont give up 
the checkbook and women who wont give up tennis and the other 
way around 
often its not until death or divorce that women take a more 
active role in their financial future said jan warner a columbia 
sc lawyer who runs solosource inc a service that counsels 
divorced women on financial options 
warner estimates that threequarters of his female clients most 
of whom are age 40 or older come to him without the financial 
knowhow needed to make it alone comfortably 
the average person that comes to us has been the victim of the 
demise of a 15to 20yearold marriage with no business acumen 
because she has relied on someone else to do it he said and 
we deal with some pretty good business women 
mary lynn 47 a real estate broker from cleveland fits into 
that category recently divorced from her husband of 24 years she 
has crammed to learn enough about investment matters to make it on 
her own 
the woman who asked not to be identified by her full married 
name said she expected to receive between 50000 and 60000 once 
the family house is sold shes looking for investments 
he the exhusband just basically did all the decision making 
where money was concerned she said i guess that was one of 
the sore spots he never really asked or consulted me 
stein the financial planner said that wives of breadwinners 
no matter how stable their marriages might seem should try to 
garner some financial independence he suggested they establish 
credit and accummulate assets solely in their own name since their 
husbands likely are doing just that through their own company 
retirement plans 
money and the inability to discuss it openly and honestly 
causes more damn problems than anything else said hank madden a 
financial planner with ids financial services incs jacksonville 
fla office who has been advising the fishers 
he said the hairreplacement entrepreneurs stand out among his 
clients because each would be prepared to make an investment 
decision individually still he said the financial philosophies 
of the fishers appear to reflect some sexual stereotypes 
men for example are more likely to be risktakers while women 
tend to be a bit more conservative and accountable 
barbara is my conscience she is more frugal fisher said of 
his wife 
im concerned with losing money thats my biggest fear 
said mrs fisher he has a more indepth grip on whats 
happening he would come home and tell me about whatever hes 
interested in and we would make a decision together

this years later easter and lackluster business conditions made 
march a mediocre month for many of the nations major chain stores 
retailers reported thursday 
store executives and retail economists said april should turn 
out to be a better month for business as holiday promotions 
capitalize on a seasonal upsurge in demand for spring clothing and 
other merchandise 
the retailers march results varied some big chains had 
strongerthanexpected sales management at some companies asserted 
that sales actually were quite good considering they missed out on 
preeaster business 
rosalind wells chief economist at the national retail 
federation in new york said stores are looking forward to a 
successful easter sales period in april after an encouraging 
march 
last months sales were compared with march 1989 when stores 
drew customers because of holiday promotions pushing everything 
from spring clothing to candy easter fell on march 26 last year 
the largest chain reporting thursday was k mart corp which 
blamed the calendar shift for its soso showing 
the troy michbased discounter which ranked second in 
nationwide sales volume last year behind sears roebuck and co 
said its total sales for the five weeks ended april 4 rose 86 
percent but sales fell 11 percent at stores open at least a year 
results from stores open a year or longer give a more accurate 
reading on a retailers performance these samestore or 
comparablestore results exclude sales at new outlets which 
sometimes are inflated temporarily by the hoopla of store openings 
sales were strong in the first two weeks of march but because 
of the later date for easter in 1990 than in 1989 sales weakened 
in line with expectations in the latter part of the month said k 
mart chairman and chief executive officer joseph e antonini 
several major mass merchandisers such as sears walmart stores 
inc jc penney co inc and others already posted their march 
sales a week ago overall those results were sluggish the 
exceptions were the perennial star performer walmart and stores 
concentrating on apparel including penney 
appareloriented retailers have almost consistently outpaced 
general merchandise chains that devote much of their business to 
costly durable goods for more than a year subpar economic growth 
with workers in some industries worried about layoffs have made 
consumers cautious about spending heavily or going into debt to 
finance expensive purchases 
the governments more comprehensive retail sales report also 
issued thursday illustrated how a weak economy has flashed warning 
signals to consumers outlays have been curbed by the federal 
reserve boards high interest rate policy aimed at diffusing 
inflationary pressures 
the commerce department said retail sales fell a seasonally 
adjusted 06 percent in march from february the report covered 
sales at a wide range of establishments including stores auto 
dealerships restaurants and elsewhere 
still some stores have managed to prosper 
i think overall the companies that have been doing well in the 
past continue to improve market share in a very challenging 
environment said retail analyst richard pyle at piper jaffrey amp 
hopwood in minneapolis it does appear that the shoppers are 
willing to spend if the merchants have the right merchandise 
dayton hudson corp the minneapolisbased owner of the target 
discount chain and mervyns department stores did well in march 
companywide sales rose 149 percent in the five weeks ended april 7 
while sales at stores open at least a year gained 82 percent 
may department stores co posted a 75 percent increase in sales 
over a year earlier the st louisbased chain which operates lord 
amp taylor and numerous other wellknown retail names reported the 
results from continuing operations only its samestore sales were 
up only 27 percent 
los angelesbased carter hawley hale stores inc said weakness 
in womens and childrens apparel as well as in shoes contributed 
to a 19 percent sales drop overall and a 24 percent on a 
comparable store basis 
among stores selling exclusively apparel the limited inc said 
its sales rose 8 percent but rose a more modest 4 percent on a 
comparable store basis 
analysts said the sales gains for the limited which has its 
headquarters in columbus ohio were lower than in many past months 
because sales were compared with march 1989s robust results 
another apparel specialty chain the gap inc posted a 20 
percent jump in march sales samestore sales rose 12 percent

record casino gambling profits 
pushed quarterly earnings up 92 percent at hilton hotels corp 
which took itself off the auction block in march because of 
disappointing low offers 
the las vegas hilton results last year were abnormally low 
but the improvement there and at the flamingo hiltonlas vegas are 
positive considering the recent capacity expansion along the las 
vegas strip said hiltons chairman barron hilton 
during its first quarter which ended march 31 hilton had net 
income of 251 million or 52 cents per share compared with 131 
million or 27 cents per share in the same period a year earlier 
revenue rose by 18 percent from 2251 million to 2655 million

it was in the gaming segment where profits rocketedby 119 percent 
to 338 million the highest level in the companys history 
hilton said 
the company had held discussions with nearly a dozen potential 
buyers before its board of directors voted to take down the for

the new york times co said thursday its 
firstquarter profit fell 504 percent citing lower advertising 
linage at its flagship newspaper an operating loss at its magazine 
group costs associated with a new printing plant and weaker 
results from its forest products investment 
the company said it earned 166 million or 22 cents a share 
in the three months ended march 31 compared with 335 million or 
42 cents a share a year earlier 
the 1989 results included 2 million from cable operations that 
have since been sold 
firstquarter revenue rose 19 percent to 4312 million from 
4231 million a year earlier 
operating profit at the companys newspaper group which 
includes the new york times 35 regional newspapers and a onethird 
interest in the international herald tribune fell to 384 million 
from 559 million a year earlier 
the company said the main reason was an 118 percent decline in 
ad linage at the new york times because of the continuing weakeness 
in the new york regions economy about 75 percent of the decline 
in linage was in the helpwanted and real estate classifications 
which are sensitive to economic conditions 
our strong business franchises and our recent investments 
position us for renewed growth when the economy of the new york 
region improves said arthur ochs sulzberger chairman and chief 
executive 
the companys magazine group posted an operating loss of 38 
million in contrast to an operating profit of 700000 in first 
quarter 1989 
the loss resulted primarily from costs associated with the july 
1989 acquisition of mccalls magazine 
the company said increased depreciation and interest expense 
associated with completion of a new automated color production and 
distribution facility in edison nj and a new facility for the 
gwinnett ga daily news also depressed its latest results 
the companys equity in earnings after taxes from its forest 
products group fell to 30000 from 36 million a year ago as a 
result of price discounting in the newsprint market 
operating profit from its broadcasting and information services 
operations was steady

most of the junk bonds that financed the 
megatakeover of rjr nabisco inc are due in 2007 but recent 
gyrations in prices of the volatile bonds indicate how speculators 
are betting on the companys chances of paying them off 
earlier this week some highyield nabisco issues rose as much as 
4 points or about 45 per 1000 in face value before easing 
thursday as investors cashed in gains 
although nabisco is considered one of the less risky issues in 
the market for highyield debt its bonds have been volatile for 
months 
traders recently have focused on rumors that kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co which bought nabisco last year for a record 2453 
billion might be buying up an issue of bonds to avoid having to 
pay sharply higher interest on them next year 
but others say the bond price jump reflects anticipation of a 
favorable firstquarter earnings report for the tobacco and 
consumer products giant 
nabsicos first quarter earnings due out later this month are 
expected to show a marked improvement over the previous quarter 
when the company lost 144 million nabisco lost 115 billion for 
all of 1989 but had positive cash flow of 647 million after all 
interest payments were made 
if the market gets some feeling that the company is doing a 
great job then the bonds will go up and react more like stocks 
to the news said jack maxwell an analyst at wheat first 
securities in richmond va 
both nabisco and kkr have a keen interest in seeing the bonds 
trade at high prices 
although the bulk of bonds about 45 billion worth dont 
mature until 2007 their interest rate must be reset in april 
1991 or adjusted to restore the bond price to face value 
bond prices move inversely to their interest rates so the lower 
the price of the rjr nabisco bonds the higher the interest rate 
the company must offer at the reset some market watchers 
speculate for example that the rate on rjrs 1371 percent 
convertible bonds due in 2007 might have to be reset at 20 percent 
or more 
rumors circulating in the marketplace indicate kkr might be in 
the process of buying back 2 billion of bonds due in 2009 that are 
convertible to stock 
analysts say such a move not only would increase kkrs stake in 
nabisco but also likely would help boost the value of other 
outstanding nabisco junk bonds helping cut the potential reset 
interest rate 
spokespeople for both kkr and nabisco had no comment thursday on 
the rumors 
its not the first time kkr has been rumored to be buying the 
bonds said joan greenberg senior vice president at dean witter 
reynolds inc but we saw greater price movement this time 
she said 
despite the recent upturn in prices some believe it hasnt been 
enough to allay nabiscos and kkrs concerns 
when you face a reset the main problem is the interest 
expense might be too much for a company to bear said robert 
waill a vice president at the stamford co a manhattanbased 
investment management firm you can be assured that the kkr 
people are thinking about his problem 
but wheat firsts maxwell believes the time ahead of the reset 
date will help nabisco if positive fundamental data emerges on the 
company and the bond prices rise the less you have to worry 
about them and the more people there will be buying them he 
said 
maxwell said the nabisco bonds suffered from the demise of 
junkbond pioneer drexel burnham lambert inc the oncepowerful 
investment house that collapsed in february and has been in 
liquidation 
plunging prices forced managers of junk bond portfolios to sell 
some betterquality marketable securities such as rjr nabisco 
after drexel left the scene as the sole marketmaker in a number of 
lowquality junk bonds 
the couldnt sell the real junk because there was no market 
but theres an actual market in rjr junk maxwell said

chemical banking corp on thursday posted a 29 percent rise in 
its first quarter profit from a year earlier due largely to the 
sale of its interest in florida national banks while bank of new 
york corp reported flat earnings 
both of the major banking companies said problem loans led by 
debt to third world countries continued pressuring their results 
analysts said the results generally were in line with expectations 
meanwhile chemical continued to downplay criticism of its 
credit position calling inappropriate the slight downgrading 
thursday of some of its debt and preferred stock by the rating 
service fitch investors service of new york 
chemical said its first quarter profit totaled 1517 million 
or 155 per share compared with earnings of 1179 million or 
149 a share in 1989 
this years results included a pretax charge of 52 million for 
a previously announced restructuring and a pretax gain of 115 
million from the recent sale of its investment in florida national 
banks of florida inc 
bank of new york which merged with irving bank corp in a 1 
billion deal a year ago said it netted 1023 million during the 
period up 1 percent from 10105 million a year ago earnings per 
share remained unchanged at 137 
the company said earnings were hurt by a 175 million addition 
to its loanloss allowance the provision for the quarter rose to 
63 million from 46 million 
during the quarter bank of new york reduced its mediumterm 
loans to less developed countries to 552 million resulting in 
chargeoffs of 207 million most of bank of new yorks third world 
debt portfolio was inherited from irving 
chemical said lower interest income on medium and longterm 
loans to brazil and mexico helped depress its net interest income 
for the quarter to 4824 million from 5492 million last year 
total nonperforming assets declined by 265 million to 324 
billion for the entire company at chemicals texas commerce 
bancshare inc subsidiary nonperforming assets including problem 
real estate loans fell by 222 million from a year earlier 
chemicals provision for loan losses was 70 million compared 
with 907 million in the yearearlier quarter 
their asset quality is getting better said james j 
mcdermott jr a banking analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods in new 
york 
other analysts took a dimmer view 
they look weak to me when you take out the unusual items 
stephen berman an analyst with county securities usa said of 
chemicals net results 
chemical said noninterest income rose to 4457 million from 
3308 million but without a 1147 million pretax gain on the 
sale of its holdings of common stock warrants of florida national 
banks income in that category would have been flat it said 
chemical also said its noninterest expense rose to 688 
million from 642 million largely due to a 523 million charge 
for restructuring to reduce operating expenses without the charge 
noninterest expenses would have declined 87 percent the company 
said 
chemicals earnings report coincided with fitchs announcement 
that it lowered its rating on about 540 million of the companys 
debt including its senior notes debentures floating rate notes 
and 200 million of preferred stock 
the ratings which affect the companys borrowing costs still 
are considered investment grade furthermore fitch is only one of 
several debt rating services which include industry giants moodys 
investors service inc and standard amp poors corp 
fitch said its downgradings reflecting a weakening real estate 
market in the northeast chemicals primary lending market 
chemical chief financial officer joseph g sponholz called the 
action inappropriate given the steps taken to strengthen our 
balance sheet and the pattern of continuing improvement in the 
corporations credit quality 
bank of new york which released its results at its annual 
shareholders meeting said its net interest income rose 8 percent 
to 351 million noninterest income was 233 million unchanged 
from a year ago while noninterest expense declined to 3355 
million from 3427 million due to savings realized from the 
irving merger 
chairman j carter bacot told shareholders were very 
delighted with the way the merger has gone the merger expected 
to be completed by years end

futures ended mixed in subdued preholiday trading 
the grain markets will be closed on good friday 
the soybean harvest in brazil the worlds secondlargest 
soybean producer and exporter was 37 percent complete at the end

of next week said joel karlin a grain analyst in chicago with 
research department inc a brokers advisory service 
exports of brazilian soybeans and soybean meal are also expected 
to rise now that the brazilian government has clarifed some of the 
inflationfighting measures that had held up shipments of goods 
from the south american nation since last month 
sales of corn futures thursday by commercial grain dealers could 
indicate the soviet union has filled its needs for the present with 
purchases of more than 15 million metric tons of us corn during 
the past week karlin said

active in the market 
us and european markets will be closed friday ahead of easter 
sunday markets in europe will remain closed on easter monday and 
reopen tuesday while us markets will be open monday 
oil futures came under strong selling pressure this week as 
concern about abundant supplies overhanging world markets 
intensified 
the overall trend is still down said a trader at merrill 
lynch energy futures who spoke on condition that his name not be 
used today we didnt have nearly as much reaction as wednesday 
that was a wild and crazy day 
the catalyst for the selloff this week was a report from the 
american petroleum institute released after the market closed 
tuesday that us crude oil inventories rose by an unexpectedly 
large 81 million barrels last week bringing stocks significantly 
higher than a year earlier 
lingering worries about oversupply by opec members also 
depressed prices 
responding to the price weakness opecs acting president sadek 
boussena on thursday said the cartel ministers were weighing 
various steps including an emergency meeting to try to halt the 
slide in world oil prices 
market rumors that opec was considering such a meeting to deal 
with the price declines which have trimmed 3 a barrel in recent 
weeks had helped arrest a plunge in prices wednesday

crude oil futures resumed their downward spiral thursday giving 
back most of wednesdays gains in a day of rollercoaster trading 
that revolved around the prospects for an emergency opec meeting 
most futures prices of refined oil products also fell in trading 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
on other commodity markets live cattle futures posted new 
record highs pork futures advanced grains and soybeans were 
mixed and precious metals were mixed 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 28 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in may at 1778 a barrel 
wholesale home heating oil was 106 cents lower to 20 cent 
higher with may at 5383 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 35 
cent to 103 cents lower with may at 5855 cents a gallon 
crude oil for may delivery opened above wednesdays settlement 
price quickly turned sharply lower then bounced within a 93cent 
range amid reports that opec oil ministers were weighing various 
steps including an emergency meeting to halt the slide in world 
oil prices 
overproduction of crude by some members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has been blamed by some analysts for 
a 3abarrel plunge in oil prices over the past six weeks 
springtime is a period of seasonal weakness in the oil market as 
demand for heating oil tapers off 
opecs 13 oil ministers have a full meeting scheduled for may 25 
to set their output and prices for the second half of the year but 
some traders speculated the cartel would meet sooner than that to 
discuss ways of propping up prices 
i think a lot of people were very confused today said tom 
bentz director of trading for united energy inc 
there were a lot of people below the market with buy orders 
and a lot above the market with sell orders he said 
bentz said the final selloff late in the session may have 
reflected profittaking ahead of the threeday easter holiday 
weekend that begins friday 
live cattle futures made record highs for the second straight 
day on the chicago mercantile exchange amid perceptions of tight 
nearterm supplies and reports of spot cattle prices as high as 82 
cents a pound in the texas panhandle 
analysts said the record prices reflect a seasonal peak in 
demand for beef and supply tightness stemming from delayed cattle 
marketings as a result of dry pasture conditions in the southern 
plains last fall and winter 
futures prices are lower than spot prices prompting some 
packers to turn to the futures market for deliveries which is also 
boosting prices said philip stanley a trader and consultant for 
dec futures inc in lincoln neb 
on any sign of weakness in the cash market youll probably see 
some pretty active selling come into the futures even with the 
discounts on the board tanley said 
live cattle futures settled 27 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with the april contract which traded up to a record 8047 cents 
ending at 8042 cents a pound feeder cattle were 13 cent lower to 
22 cent higher with april at 84 cents a pound live hogs were 15 
cent to 50 cent higher with april at 5617 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 25 cent lower to 125 cents higher with may at 
5902 cents a pound 
soybean futures fell moderately on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting increasing harvest pressure from brazil while grain 
futures ended mixed in subdued preholiday trading 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with may 
at 367 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 
269 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents lower with may at 
149 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 
586 a bushel

higher with april at 37590 a troy ounce silver was 4 cents lower 
across the board with may at 5108 a troy ounce

219 for every 1000 in face amount its yield which rises when 
the price declines rose to 859 percent from 857 percent late 
wednesday 
traders said a retail sales report released by the government 
thursday morning initially boosted treasury prices because the 
march sales figure was weaker than expected an indication of 
economic sluggishness boosts bonds because it implies the federal 
reserve may act to ease interest rates 
but news that the government revised the february retail sales 
figure upward from an 08 percent decline to an 03 percent 
decline caused bond prices to give up their gains 
tom lanier a treasury bond trader for manufacturers hanover 
trust co said there was little activity in the market 
theres no buying going on and we keep getting hit by

announcements next week on upcoming bill and note auctions and an

thrift bailout agency on its bond auction plans 
the rtc said it may sell up to 427 billion in bonds this 
quarter about 20 billion more than wall street thought it would 
try to sell lanier said 
news of an increased supply of bonds can send prices lower for 
fear of a temporary oversupply but lanier said the effect on 
prices thursday was minimal

southland corp said it will continue to lose 
money until 1993 even if debt holders agree to forego 16 billion 
in interest payments as part of a complex debt restructuring 
the owner of the 7eleven convenience store chain projected a 
small 38 million profit in 1993 if it can restructure its debts 
and use cash to revamp its stores 
the forecast was contained in a preliminary prospectus on the 
restructuring that the company issued wednesday 
the plan involves the restructuring of 18 billion in bonds and 
preferred stock and would require holders of those securities to 
forego 16 billion in interest payments due through 1997 it also 
calls for selling 75 percent of the company to japanese business 
partners 
the company is struggling because it took on about 49 billion 
in debt when the founding thompson family took southland private in 
1987 the company lost 13 billion last year 
the prospectus said southland expects to lose 156 million this 
year 61 million in 1991 and 9 million in 1992 capital 
investments in new stores should bring the company a 38 million 
profit in 1993 and a 67 million gain in 1994 
southland late last month announced plans to sell 75 percent of 
the company to its japanese partners itoyokado co ltd and 
7eleven japan co ltd in exchange for 400 million in badly 
needed cash 
bond holders are skeptical about the proposal which would give 
them a stake of about 10 percent the thompson family about 10 
percent and other common shareholders about 5 percent of the 
restructured company 
southland officials reiterated their belief that unless 
bondholders approve the restructuring cashflow problems would 
force the company to seek relief under the bankruptcy code 
the preliminary filing stated that southland plans to open 1814 
new stores and close 1724 others by the end of 1997 to compete 
with convenience store rivals southland opened 60 stores and 
closed 340 others in 1989

some suppliers reportedly are refusing 
to ship goods to ames department stores putting further pressure 
on the lossplagued discount chain which is seeking a new credit 
agreement from banks 
shipments of clothing hardware soft drinks and other products 
needed to fill ames shelves for spring have been suspended for the 
last month by some suppliers who say they havent been paid for 
earlier deliveries the wall street journal reported thursday 
the report comes as ames tries to dig itself out of a cash 
crunch by selling stores and cutting jobs 
ames announced monday that it lost an estimated 288 million in 
the fiscal year ending jan 27 because of lower than anticipated 
sales at the former zayre stores ames bought in 1988 it also 
announced it was negotiating with banks for a credit agreement 
the 788 million acquisition of the 392store zayre chain 
doubled ames size and transformed the company from a littleknown 
new englandbased chain into the nations fourthlargest discounter 
as part of the credit agreement it is seeking ames plans to 
close 74 unprofitable stores the company is negotiating to sell 
the inventory of those stores to jerome schottentein a columbus 
ohio merchandise liquidator 
the retailer also said monday it will slash 200 jobs at its 
corporate headquarters in rocky hill 
ames officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on 
the journal report 
the newspaper reported that gerber childrenswear inc a unit of 
gerber products co said it will not ship 1 million worth of 
spring wear ordered by ames until it is paid a portion of the 12 
million owed by ames for winter clothing shipped earlier 
the journal also reported that pepsico inc said it will not 
make soft drink deliveries to ames unless it is paid in cash 
retail analysts said the suppliers actions could touch off a 
downward spiral for ames if the company is unable to convince key 
vendors that it can turn itself around 
unfortunately when these situations occur they tend to have 
a snowball effect said alan millstein publisher of the fashion 
network a monthly newsletter for retailers and manufacturers 
this becomes and has a tendency to spread like wildfire he 
said 
jeffrey branman managing director for financo inc a new york 
investment bank that specializes in retail industry transactions 
said the slowdown in deliveries from suppliers is particularly 
critical coming at the start of the spring season when shoppers 
expect new clothing lines to come in 
what can happen is that because vendors tend to act en masse 
it can turn a modest cash shortage into a big cash shortage said 
branman 
analysts cited a similar problem experienced by two campeau 
corp subsidiaries federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp 
earlier this year a shutdown by suppliers helped force the 
subsidiaries into filing for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
some analysts said they believe the company can bounce back from 
its current problems by moving quickly to convince suppliers they 
will be paid 
most of the people who are selling to them dont want to see 
ames go away if they can get their key vendors paid and in 
line i think theyll be ok said joseph ahearn a retail 
industry analyst for gdl management inc a new yorkbased crisis 
management consulting firm 
millstein said the most important thing for ames to do now is to 
put a very positive spin on their operations with ames 
it becomes an issue of how quickly they can convince their 
suppliers that they are not a credit risk he said

the stock market broke the stalemate of the past 
several sessions with a rally in quiet preholiday trading thursday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 2207 to 
275180 finishing the week with a net gain of 3468 points

the dow industrials neither rose nor fell by as much as 10 points

908 up 573 down and 518 unchanged

consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the overthecounter 
market totaled 17370 million shares 
analysts said traders came into the session with low 
expectations given the markets recent sluggish behavior and the 
approach of a long holiday weekend the markets will be closed for 
good friday 
in that kind of environment observers said an absence of 
selling pressure helped produce some pleasant surprises in the 
price fluctuations of individual stocks 
the government reported that retail sales dropped 06 percent in 
march in contrast to advance estimates of a small increase 
that served as a new suggestion of continued sluggish erratic 
economic growth along with possibly less upward pressure on 
interest rates than has been feared of late 
brokers also noted that favorable earnings reports from several 
companies contributed to the upbeat mood 
for example chemical banking which posted higher quarterly 
profits gained 1lsqb to 24 most other moneycenter bank issues 
moved up in sympathy 
federal national mortgage jumped 1 to 36 on wednesday the 
company known as fannie mae chalked up a 67 percent increase in 
its firstquarter profits 
fannie mae warrants which give their owners the right to buy 
the stock at 1475 a share rose 1 to 21 
gainers among the bluechip industrials included general 
electric up 1lsqb at 66 international business machines up at 
107lsqb mcdonalds up at 32 procter amp gamble up at 71 and 
cocacola up at 80 
ames department stores led the active list down at 1 on 
reports that some manufacturers had stopped shipping merchandise to 
the troubled retailer

actively traded stocks the market increased 2115 billion or 
064 percent in value 
the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks added 
123 to 18880

sampps 500stock composite index was up 242 at 34434

said trading was very quiet with most players retreating to the 
sidelines 
on the stock market the nikkei index initially fell on 
indexlinked arbitrage selling and then on smalllot selling 
securities dealers said 
in arbitrage trading investors seek to profit from differences 
between prices of actual stocks and stock index futures 
yoshihide koyama an equity analyst with nikko securites 
attributed the fall in the index to speculation that japans 
central bank may raise its official discount rate once again in an 
attempt to stem the yens downswing 
the bank of japan raised its key rate last month by 1 percentage 
point to 525 percent higher interest rates tend to support a 
countrys currency but discourage stock investment

interest rates the yield on the benchmark no 119 government bond 
rose to 737 percent from 7295 percent thursday
