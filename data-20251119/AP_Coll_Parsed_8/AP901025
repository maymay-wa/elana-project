the house approved a military spending bill 
thursday that slashes president bushs 1991 budget request for the 
strategic defense initiative but adopts the pentagons plan for a 
hightech fighter aircraft 
by voice vote the house passed the legislation which provides 
268 billion for the nations defense in the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 a cut of 19 billion from bushs initial proposal in 
january 
debate and final passage of the largest bill before the congress 
took a mere 11 minutes as lawmakers push to adjourn before sunday 
the legislation now goes to the senate which is expected to 
approve the measure 
the senate was unable to complete debate and put off final 
action until friday 
defense secretary dick cheney supports the spending bill and 
bushs signature is likely 
among the provisions in the bill which meets the targets set in 
a defense blueprint adopted by the house late wednesday is a 
nearly 2 billion cut in bushs 47 billion request for sdi and a 
reduction in funds for the b2 stealth bomber that keeps the 
program alive for at least one more year 
this bill shows restraint its a lean bill said rep john 
murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on 
defense 
the legislation largely tracks the military blueprint but breaks 
ranks with the authorization bill on several issues 
the spending plan calls for a troop cut of 78500 from the 21 
million men and women in uniform worldwide just over 900 million 
for the milstar communications satellite and fullscale development 
of the advanced tactical fighter 
the administration requested 283 million for fullscale 
development and 763 million to complete the demonstration and 
validation phase of the prototype aircraft 
the defense blueprint provides 964 million for the program but 
prohibits fullscale development in fiscal 1991 
the authorization bill emphasizes the need for the air force to 
finish demonstrating several technologies including aerodynamic 
performance low observability and engine capability before 
beginning fullscale development 
the pentagon plans to begin buying the aircraft intended to 
replace the air forces f15 in 1996 the total number of fighters 
to be bought is 750 
the spending bill concurs with the administrations request on 
the fighter as well as its proposal for the sramt a standoff 
tactical nuclear weapon 
the pentagon sought 118 million in fiscal 1991 to begin sramt 
test units and f15e adaptor hardware the authorization bill 
provides 35 million while the spending bill meets the 
administrations total 
the blueprint reduces us troop levels by 100000 but bowing 
to pressure from the pentagon gives the defense secretary added 
authority to limit the troop cut to 80000 if he believes the us 
military buildup in the persian gulf warrants such a step 
the authorization bill also provides 600 million for milstar 
but again responding to pentagon demands gives cheney the 
authority to transfer money from other accounts for the program 
in other action the house approved a beefedup version of the 
defense production act of 1950 extending its authority for another 
three years 
by voice vote the house adopted the measure aimed at 
revitalizing the us defense industry through an array of steps 
including giving the president the authority to maintain the 
technology base 
it will ensure that our troops in the persian gulf receive the 
equipment and supplies they need said rep joseph moakley

while millions of americans were spending last 
easter weekend rushing to finish their taxes members of the main 
house taxation committee were on a taxpayerpaid trip to barbados 
on something like candid camera 
there to discuss a trade bill the lawmakers spent much of their 
time frolicking at the pool being entertained by lobbyists or 
golfing at taxpayers expense unknowingly under the watchful eyes 
of a television news crew 
the fiveday fournight stay at the paradise village and beach 
club came at the end of a 12day official committee trip by 34 
people that also included stops in several south american cities 
the bill 100000 in all 40000 for the barbados portion 
the eight members of the house ways and means committee were met 
and entertained on the caribbean island by lobbyists representing 
insurance and computer companies with interests before the 
taxwriting panel 
what the lawmakers aides spouses and military escorts on the 
trip didnt know is that much of their visit was videotaped by a 
crew from abctvs primetime live which broadcast a report on 
the trip thursday night 
the barbados stop was approved by committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill so the lawmakers could research the caribbean 
basin initiative a trade bill before the panel 
according to abc the lawmakers spent less than seven hours in 
business meetings and most of their time relaxing each billed the 
government for 1176 in daily expenses and other expense costs 
even though they received many of their meals free at official 
receptions or those hosted by lobbyists 
on the second day of the trip the lawmakers attended a 
40minute morning meeting on the trade legislation and another 
hourlong meeting later after a luncheon at the prime ministers 
residence according to the network 
by midafternoon the work was done and three members went 
golfing billing their greens fees to the us embassy other 
lawmakers and members of the delegation relaxed at the resort pool 
i think that this idea that the press thinks these trips are 
junkets is absolutely ridiculous one of the three golfing 
lawmakers on the trip democratic rep marty russo of illinois 
told abc the bottom line is we work very hard on these trips 
also on the trip were rostenkowski democratic reps fortney 
stark of california barbara kennelly of connecticut thomas downey 
of new york and george miller of california and republican reps 
richard schulze of pennsylvania raymond mcgrath of new york and 
guy vander jagt of michigan miller is not a member of the ways and 
means committee but was invited on the trip by rostenkowski 
the videotape of the trip shows lawmakers swimming snorkeling 
jet skiing sunbathing and playing football with some of the 
lobbyists 
the lobbyists included two for mutual insurance companies that 
would benefit under tax legislation filed by downey and a former 
top russo aide who now works at a law firm representing comdisco a 
chicago a computer company that would benefit from leigislation 
filed by russo 
until last year russo was on retainer for the same law firm 
coffield ungaretti harris and slavin russos past two financial 
disclosure forms show he received 25000 from the firm in 1988 and 
1989 
downey who only participated in the barbados portion of the 
trip and was videotaped with one of the insurance lobbyists before 
the rest of the delegation arrived told the program there was no 
discussion of legislation with the lobbysits 
he said he suspected the lobbyists were there so that they can 
see us in an informal setting 
russo said he did not believe his legislation presented a 
conflict because of his past role at the law firm he said his 
former aides role as a lobbyist had nothing to do with his 
introducing the legislation 
i introduced a bill for the computer industry because i think 
the computer indistry in this country is being unfairly taken 
advantage of he said 
abc said the other lawmakers on the trip declined to be 
interviewed for the segment abc traveled to barbados ahead of the 
delegation after receving a tip about the trip and the crew 
videotaped the activities of the delegation using handheld 
cameras

equals the number reported in all of the 1980s federal health 
officials said 
one outbreak in washington state was linked to a large family 
reunion centers for disease control researchers said thursday the 
locations of the other outbreaks werent disclosed but the 
researchers said two were reported in restaurants one was linked 
to homecooked food one was traced to imported shellfish and the 
other had an unknown origin 
typhoid fever once a dreaded disease is most commonly linked 
to poor sanitation it is spread via contaminated food and water 
its now rare in the developed world 
symptoms include fever headache pains and nausea 
preliminary cdc reports show 406 cases reported nationwide with 
10 weeks remaining in the year if that rate continues the 1990 
total could reach 503 the most since 1983 
the cdc received reports of only six typhoid outbreaks or 
clusters of cases from 1980 to 1989 
the family reunion outbreak occurred at a gathering of 293 
people from five states in skagit county wash the cdc said at 
least 17 people at the reunion were dagnosed with typhoid fever 
the average illness lasted 20 days 
health investigators found that three food items served at the 
reunion were linked to the outbreak a person who prepared one of 
them tested positive as a carrier of the typhoid bacteria 
typhoid is preventable by a vaccine recommended for americans 
traveling to areas with typhoid problems such as central and south 
america africa india and southeast asia the vaccine has been 
reported to cause severe side effects in some cases including high 
fever but an oral vaccine approved earlier this year promises 
fewer side effects

daniel ortega who won international 
respect by accepting an election defeat says revolution in latin 
america may survive the collapse of european communism but not if 
its leaders cling to dogma 
nicaraguas former president said in an interview that injustice 
and poverty still are problems in the region providing the fodder 
of revolution 
at 46 with a decade of leadership behind him as head of the 
sandinista national liberation front ortega has abandoned the 
olive fatigues and blackandred bandanna of his guerrilla days and 
years in power president bush once compared the outfit to a boy 
scout uniform 
ortega cultivates a youthful image dressing in jeans and 
colorful shirts and remains politically active in nicaragua and 
abroad young admirers pursue him for autographs when he appears in 
public 
his acceptance of the february election loss to violeta 
chamorro nicaraguas new president improved his image in the 
world at home ortega has reined in the more radical elements of 
the sandinista national liberation front 
a combination of ortegas influence and two crippling strikes 
led by the sandinistas persuaded the new government to retain many 
sandinista programs including land distribution 
the reality of nicaragua is that no one can govern without the 
fsln he said using the initials of the sandinista front 
i am sure that our talks with the government and our attempts 
to reach a consensus have angered some people inside the 
government but we think common sense is prevailing 
elements of mrs chamorros fractious coalition accuse her of 
weakness for dealing with the sandinistas who are by far the 
largest party in nicaragua and want to be consulted on important 
economic decisions 
the sandinistas oppose such austerity measures as currency 
devaluations reductions in the public payroll and selling 
nationalized industries back to private investors 
ortega works for the party and travels abroad seeking foreign 
aid for nicaragua 
he said being out of office allows him more time with his eight 
children but that they interfere with a book he is writing on the 
years in government 
wealthy nations are focusing on their own concerns at the 
expense of latin america and other poor regions ortega said 
we will now see an industrialized north including the former 
socialist countries that will determine the distribution of the 
worlds technological resources he predicted the problems of 
the third world will continue the industrialized countries of the 
north have no time to consider our economies or problems in the 
south 
us economic assistance to mrs chamorros government has not 
met nicaraguan expectations about 65 million in cash has been 
provided since april and an additional 40 million is promised in 
credits for agricultural development 
the collapse of the eastern socialist bloc gives the united 
states the hegemonic control that always was its objective in latin 
america ortega said the policies of assistance of the 
socialist bloc disappear and they are not compensated by the 
united states or other industrialized countries 
this places latin america at a disadvantage it does not help 
our countries the need for revolutionary change remains 
we still have a revolutionary movement in el salvador and 
brazil can explode too we have armed groups in peru and colombia 
what happened in the east does not improve the living conditions of 
people in the south 
washington no longer can accuse all revolutionary movements of 
being communist ortega added and at the same time the 
revolutionary movement must rethink the kind of projects and 
programs they want in the past there was a tendency to 
dogmatism 
our revolution was never subordinated to the soviet union 
he said they offered their support after the victory 
the united states must show respect for latin america if it 
wants a world of peace and latin america must increase its 
contacts with sectors of influence in the united states that 
know the rich will sink if the needs of the poor are not 
satisfied ortega said 
of nicaraguas future and the sandinista role in it he said 
we realize this government came to power with the help of the 
united states we accepted the challenge in the elections 
but the nicaraguan revolutions changes brought on by the 
sandinista front remain 
now the party must change and adapt to the times neither the 
structure nor the programs of a party are immovable we now need 
other forms although the objectives of ending human exploitation 
and the principles of justice remain 
we still have a lot to do to emerge from the crisis he 
said

the prince of wales called for an end to the 
destruction of britains wildlife habitats which he said were 
damaged by development 
nearly 700 sites of special scientific interest were lost or 
damaged between 1984 and 1988 the heir to the british throne said 
thursday quoting government figures 
roadbuilding plans in southeast britain could damage more than 
370 other sites he said 
the prince patron of the royal society for nature conservation 
was speaking at the release of a society report on nature 
conservation in britain 
in a videotaped message played at a london news conference the 
prince said there was widespread recognition of the need to consult 
environmental groups before going ahead with development 
one pond drained one new road through one small corner of an 
ancient woodland might not in itself be a disaster but the 
destruction of a whole network of sites by a whole catalogue of 
changes can destroy the viability of entire communities of 
wildlife he said

federal prosecutors saying that marion barry 
is sorry only that he got caught urged thursday that the 
citys mayor be given the maximum sentence of one year in prison 
and be fined 100000 for his misdemeanor cocaine conviction 
barry meanwhile pleaded for mercy from the judge saying he is 
sorry for his actions and already has been humiliated the mayors 
wife effi also wrote to the judge saying some of the witnesses 
at her husbands trial were lying and that the ordeal has left him 
publicly castrated 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson is scheduled to 
sentence barry on friday 
in a memo us attorney jay b stephens said barry has shown a 
flagrant disregard for the law and seriously impugned the 
integrity of his office 
in short the defendant is not genuinely remorseful about his 
criminality the document said he is sorry only that he got 
caught 
barry was convicted aug 10 on one count of cocaine possession 
and acquitted of another the jury was unable to reach a verdict on 
the remaining 12 counts including three perjury charges 
in his letter barry wrote that he is a drug addict and was 
deeply sorry for behavior he called degrading and 
outrageous 
when i sat in your courtroom each day hearing things about 
myself that i had not wanted to face i may have appeared to be 
calm and unmoved but on the inside i was suffering nearly 
unbearable humiliation and deepest regret barry wrote to 
jackson 
mrs barry asked the judge to search your humanity 
what further punishment does this man deserve the mayors 
wife wrote for certain there can be no greater sentence than to 
have the whole world tune into your day in court as you are 
publicly castrated 
the letters from barry and his wife were included with numerous 
documents filed on his behalf with the court on thursday the 
washington post reported in its friday editions 
at a hearing last week barrys attorney r kenneth mundy 
objected to a finding in the probation officers report that the 
mayor was not sorry for his actions 
stephens decided not to retry the 54yearold mayor and mundy 
said barry had decided not to seek a new trial on the one 
conviction 
in the governments sentencing memo stephens charged barry had 
a brazen disregard for the law which conveyed a particularly 
devastating message to a number of people 
according to the prosecutor barrys conduct was 
disheartening to law enforcement officers who were struggling 
to bring drugdriven crime in the district under control 
barry also undermined the nations efforts to work with foreign 
countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs stephens maintained 
how are we to explain to these officials that our efforts to 
reduce the nearinsatiable demand for drugs in this country is 
earnest and is not empty rhetoric when an elected official who 
publicly urges all to just say no in reality was adding to the 
demand for illegal drugs the prosecutor wrote 
he also said barrys actions had a devastating effect on 
efforts to convince young people that their future as well as 
ours rests with their rejection of drugs 
the memo says that barry in his presentencing interview with a 
probation officer admitted to two dozen unspecified cocaine 
possessions 
barrys third fouryear term as mayor expires in january he is 
an independent candidate in the november general election for one 
of two atlarge city council positions

picture a child playing war games 
in a sandbox marching his toy soldiers here moving toy tanks 
there leveling ripples with his bulldozers and roaring his play 
jets overhead with sweeps of the hand 
thats a miniature version of what it looks like in saudi 
arabia except the sandbox is an endless tract of desert and the 
soldiers and weapons are real 
the united states has deployed some 210000 troops in operation 
desert shield and thousands of missiles artillery pieces tanks 
combat jets and armed helicopters to confront saddam hussein in 
occupied kuwait 
the british french saudis egyptians pakistanis and other 
allies have sent thousands more men with their arsenals of modern 
weapons 
this deployment the biggest us military operation overseas 
since vietnam has turned the desert once the domicile of bedouin 
and camels into an awesome arena of military power 
less than three months ago the only tracks in the desert were 
from the hooves of hardy animals now those tracks have been 
obliterated by the crazyquilt pattern of tank treads armored 
personnel carriers trucks and the new generation of jeep 
where once the desert air was pierced by the occasional bleating 
of goats jet engines whine the dull thud of helicopter blades 
assaults the ears and the crack of guns is heard on practice 
ranges 
clouds of dust spit up by columns of vehicles on the move whirl 
through the air 
there is something captivating and scary about all this military 
maneuvering 
from a helicopter cockpit the olivedrab tents of military 
encampments look like mushroom clusters they contrast with the 
white bedouin tents donated by the saudis 
scout helicopters skim along the horizon like angry hornets 
buzzing from their nest to respond to intruders 
from the road the barrels of guns on tanks dug in among the 
dunes poke out from under camouflage nets toward the north where 
an estimated 430000 iraqis are deployed in and around kuwait 
to say hello crews flash hand signals used by surfers 
near port facilities patriot surfacetoair missiles designed 
to take out hostile incoming missiles point northward 
sandbag bunkers surround encampments and giant closed 
warehouses that the imagination fills with endless stacks of 
ammunition and other supplies 
concrete barriers rise in roadways to deter truck bombs or other 
terrorist attacks 
everywhere convoys are on the move some trucks haul soldiers 
on maneuvers others dash back to the rear for supplies 
they are the tail that leads to the teeth of the military beast 
at the front 
the frontline troops get hot meals for breakfast and dinner 
these are trucked to the front so are water for the soldiers and 
gasoline for thirsty vehicles 
some troops are ferried by bus back to the rear for showers and 
what little recreation they can find soldiers like native saudis 
play football and soccer on grassless fields 
new features such as a heliport being paved on top of the 
blistering landscape materialize almost overnight like mirages to 
a disbelieving wanderer 
each morning brings a spectacular dawn each night an equally 
inspiring sunset the roar of nighttime traffic pierces otherwise 
silent starry nights 
out of sight but not out of mind is an international armada of 
more than 70 warships from a dozen countries bobbing in the gulf 
and the waters around the arabian peninsula 
even the saudi cities offer strange images concrete and glass 
towers rise from the arid wasteland thanks to the petrobillions 
earned from the oilfields 
these riches allow such luxuries as sixlane highways paved 
through the deserts and baskinrobbins shops in suburban malls 
in the bazaar of alkhobar just outside dhahran shops offer 
tshirts with desert shield themes one depicts a camel in a gas 
mask riding a flying carpet another shows tanks idled in the sand 
with a few zs printed above and the legend all quiet on the 
eastern front 
servicemen and women are often seen shopping mostly buying air 
conditioners and stereo equipment to alleviate the heat and boredom 
of waiting for a war that might never happen 
soldiers in airy desert camouflage fatigues hardly raise 
eyebrows any more when they wander through hotel lobbies or grocery 
stores carrying rifles and sidearms 
the sandbox is accustomed to the reallife war machine

japans proposal to deploy troops overseas is being 
dragged down by fierce resistance in parliament and if it fails 
prime minister toshiki kaifus job could go with it analysts say 
polls published thursday showed kaifus popularity in a sharp 
dive largely because of the perception that he is waffling on a 
decisive issue for japan in the persian gulf standoff 
that negative image has been magnified by televised debate in 
parliament over the deployment bill an acutely sensitive issue in 
this nation kaifu is seen repeatedly shifting position under 
attack from opposition members who seem to have enough votes to 
defeat the bill 
kaifu has done it with spectacular incompetence said 
garrett scalera president of the tokyo institute of policy 
studies i think his days are numbered 
the newspaper yomiuri shimbun published a poll thursday showing 
that support for kaifus cabinet has fallen by 10 points since last 
month to 498 percent most of the drop was attributed to the prime 
ministers wavering statements in parliament 
another leading newspaper the mainichi shimbun put his support 
at 35 percent a drop of 6 points the polls did not give a margin 
of error 
in july a yomiuri poll had kaifus popularity at 625 percent 
the highest rate for any postwar cabinet 
those results in part reflected the 59yearold prime ministers 
strong showing at the houston economic summit and us trade talks 
earlier in the year the gulf crisis however has been a far more 
serious test for kaifu and hes responded with a series of 
flipflops 
after the aug 2 iraqi invasion kaifu announced a financial aid 
package for the gulf but declared the nations selfdefense forces 
sdf would not go when japans senior security partner the 
united states expressed unhappiness over the decision kaifu did 
an aboutface 
the result was a proposal to deploy support troops under the 
united nations umbrella that opened a pandoras box that japan has 
preferred to keep shut whether to reconsider its postworld war ii 
constitutional ban on using force overseas 
kaifu himself didnt want to send the sdf from the very 
beginning his indecisiveness is the reason why the bill is so 
unpopular said seizaburo sato a tokyo university politics 
professor and former adviser to two prime ministers 
if kaifu really firmly believed it was necessary for japan to 
send the selfdefense forces the people would accept it 
faced with antideployment sentiment at home as well as in other 
asian countries kaifu has been at best confusing at worst 
selfcontradictory under intense grilling from leading opposition 
members at a special session of parliament in recent weeks 
on wednesday for example he was pressed to clarify what 
cooperation japan could offer to gulf forces already there kaifu 
answered he could not say at present despite previous assertions 
that his peace cooperation corps would be involved in 
transportation medical aid and other specific noncombat 
activities 
and he dismissed concerns that corps members might face armed 
conflicts overseas despite some forecasts the gulf could soon 
erupt in war 
some experts say kaifus political weakness in japans ruling 
liberal democratic party a factor since he was installed in august 
1989 has finally come home to roost 
the prime minister elected from a small party faction as a 
compromise candidate has been repeatedly embarrassed in recent 
weeks as powerful ldp politicians have edged him out of the 
headlines by making independent diplomatic initiatives in north and 
south korea and elsewhere 
some analysts say those politicians conservatives themselves 
who want a strong deployment bill see kaifu as a sacrificial lamb 
on the issue 
few now believe the overseas deployment bill can be passed by 
the time parliaments special session ends nov 10 
with kaifus credibility bound up in the proposal the only 
thing that might save him from resigning if the bill fails is the 
lack of a consensus candidate to replace him before his term ends 
in november 1991

frustration over the political and 
economic impasse gripping nicaragua has flared into a wave of 
bombings looting land takeovers and armed skirmishes 
president violeta chamorro and a 14party coalition swept to 
victory in february ending more than a decade of revolutionary 
sandinista rule with promises of economic recovery and peace 
but the sandinistas by far the largest and bestorganized 
pressure group in the country have used negotiations and muscle to 
keep control of the army and police and to block the governments 
economic programs 
in view of the governments relative impotence some of the 
sandinistas enemies are threatening to take the situation into 
their own hands 
the episcopal conference the influential organization of 
nicaraguas 11 roman catholic bishops warned thursday against the 
deteriorating situation 
there is a growing frustration in broad sectors of the 
population regarding the use and future of the vote cast last feb 
25 and of the implementation of measures and programs different 
from that for which they voted the conference said in a 
statement 
on wednesday about 300 demobilized contra rebels and 
sympathizers surrounded the sandinistacontroled police station in 
the small town of rio blanco demanding the removal of the police 
chief 
the same day a gathering of businessmen government officials 
and independent and sandinista labor unions broke off negotiations 
aimed at developing an economic program after 34 days of talks 
while all sides agree that nicaraguas economy is flattened by 
hyperinflation a fiscal deficit and low production the government 
is being pulled by the demands of leftist sandinistas and rightist 
business groups neither of which seem willing to compromise 
the sandinistas say government proposals to stabilize the 
economy will cause mass unemployment business groups say the plans 
dont go far enough 
the superior council for private enterprise nicaraguas major 
business group claims the government has diluted its plans to 
return property confiscated under leftist sandinista rule 
partial strikes by sandinistaorganized government workers are 
frequent and disruptive their demands range from pay raises to the 
firing of officials appointed by the new government 
many of the 20000 contra rebels who finished demobilizing in 
june are unhappy with what they say are broken government promises 
for land 
former rebels have taken over sandinista cooperatives in remote 
parts of nicaragua and shootouts between exrebels and sandinista 
security forces have left more than 12 people dead and scores 
wounded 
last week the government declared a state of emergency in the 
remote atlantic town of puerto cabezas where demobilized indian 
rebels looted government warehouses accusing the officials of 
stealing donations intended for them three people were wounded and 
21 people arrested 
earlier this month at least 200 exrebels took over the hamlet 
of waslala in northern nicaragua forcing out sandinista police and 
soldiers in clashes that left four dead 
around the same time bombings temporarily silenced two managua 
radio stations one sandinista and the other fiercely 
antisandinista

mashhoor a bearded druse moslem 
militiaman greased his ak47 and wrapped it tightly in a plastic 
bag to bury it just in case thousands of gunmen like him are 
doing the same 
after countless bloody battles in the course of lebanons 
15yearold civil war the three main moslem and christian militias 
agreed thursday to withdraw from beirut and its environs but it is 
an uneasy peace 
this rifle is mine mashhoor said i won it in a battle 
in 1984 who knows when i or someone dear to me will need it 
approval of the withdrawal plan came from samir geageas 
rightwing chritian lebanese forces militia nabih berris 
moderate shiite amal militia and druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
but hezbollah or party of god held off on promising a pullout 
the shiite group is believed be an umbrella for underground 
extremists holding most of 13 missing westerners in lebanon 
hezbollah with some 3500 mainforce fighters has long feuded 
with the more secular amal for control of lebanons 12 million 
shiites the countrys biggest sect 
the groundwork was laid for the militia withdrawal when 
president elias hrawis syrian backers crushed a mutiny by rebel 
christian gen michel aoun oct 13 in fighting that killed up to 
750 people in eight hours 
the ultimate objective is to be disarm the militias and absorb 
some of their fighters into government security forces but 
hardened gunslingers like mashhoor a nom de guerre meaning 
famous dont believe it will happen 
no one believes theyll be disbanded it never worked before 
it wont work now mashhoor said 
there are about 20000 fighters in the dozen or so militias 
many have their own personal arsenals of automatic weapons grenade 
launchers explosives and hand grenades 
during past disarmament bids fighters handed over some weapons 
but hid most of their arms including tanks artillery and 
mortars 
many of the fighters like mashhoor have known nothing but 
violence they are school dropouts with no skills serving in the 
militia is a meal ticket the fighters simply take what they want 
at restaurants bars and gas stations 
mashhoor has been a member of the druse progressive socialist 
party militia since he was seven years old the civil war is all 
hes ever known 
he was born marwan yahya and grew up in druse town of shweifat 
in the chouf foothills when the war broke out in 1975 he was only 
a child but he quit school to join the fighters 
his first job in the militia was collecting empty cartridge 
cases to be refilled he was dubbed abu khartoush father of the 
bullets 
he attended school on and off during lulls in the fighting 
but he found he no longer fit in 
i was no longer willing to listen to teachers do homework and 
be disciplined he said i was abu khartoush 
at 12 he was renamed abu tabikh or father of food because i 
was driving a land rover and distributing food to fighters on the 
front lines 
in 1983 he proved himself as a fighter battling christians in 
the chouf mountains earning his fighting name warfare has been 
his trade ever since 
unlike mashhoor haidar a 37yearold amal militiaman can now 
earn a living from his peacetime profession before he took up the 
gun he was a house painter 
therell be lots of painting work to do in greater beirut 
he said in an understated reference to the warwrecked capital 
haidar echoes mashhoor in his skepticism that the militia will 
truly lay down arms 
he said amal will withdraw from the south beirut slum of shiyah 
which it controls but he said i have no orders from my 
superiors that the militia will be disbanded 
haidar said hell stay on with his militia as a parttimer he 
said on weekends he would head south to amal bases where the 
fighters would regroup 
i dont believe that the wars over once and for all he 
said i wont burn my bridges

the prophet mohammed supposedly appears 
to saddam hussein in a dream and tells him to leave kuwait or 
whispers emerge that israeli troops have crossed the jordan river 
and squared off against iraq 
these may be rumors with no relation to the truth but they move 
financial markets thoughout the world driving the price of oil and 
other commodities up or down 
either alone or coupled with the legitimate news of the day 
such hearsay can result in drastic swings in which fortunes are 
made or lost 
a rumor can affect the market just like real news said ian 
seymour editor of the cyprusbased middle east economic survey a 
respected oil industry publication 
markets are so greatly volatile that any little rumor can move 
them and move them by considerable amounts seymor said in an 
interview certainly these things go way way beyond the 
fundamental laws of supply and demand particularly in times of war 
and uncertainty 
the gulf crisis caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
provides fertile grist for the middle easts notorious rumor mill 
suddenly world oil supplies were threatened propelling prices 
skyward hints of diplomatic settlements bring them down while 
suggestions of imminent hostilities drive them up again 
a popular rumor breaking into financial markets over the past 
few weeks has been simple but effective saddam is dead slain by 
top aides or israeli commandos or unknown assassins 
although theres a chance it could backfire the general 
interpretation is that the demise of the iraqi leader would lead to 
a peaceful settlement 
on monday crude oil prices plunged more than 5 a barrel based 
on a combination of middle east peace hopes and a rumor that saddam 
told his associates that mohammed told him in a dream his rockets 
were pointed in the wrong direction 
the dream story first appeared in a kuwaiti newspaper now 
published in the gulf that has actively tried to discredit saddam 
it was based on alleged rumors from iraq 
the peace hopes stemmed from a report on a speech by saudi 
arabias defense minister prince sultan that led traders to 
believe his country was willing to make some concessions to iraq 
there were also unconfirmed reports that iraq was 
withdrawing troops from parts of kuwait 
on wednesday markets in tokyo were briefly affected by a report 
that fundamentalist moslems in jordan had allegedly declared war on 
israel 
the rumor turned into gossip that jordan had declared war on 
israel which in turn had sent its troops across the jordan river 
and was squaring off against iraq 
seymour said there are so many rumors its impossible to keep 
track of them its equally hard to find who starts them even 
though exchanges have penalties for members who engage in 
rumormongering 
the rumors appear and they have no parent seymour said 
everybody seems to plant rumors on friday afternoon just before 
closing that way you can really make hay 
futures traders react to anything whether its a rumor or 
real he said those in the trading sections of big oil 
companies tend to cover themselves by hedging 
rumor or real the gulf crisis makes for an active market 
basically one thinks that the theoretical framework for it is 
you take a price that the experts think the price would be if 
theres no threat of war say about 20 to 25 a barrel seymour 
said anything above that would be a war premium 
obviously all this feeds on rumors he said

pacific island leaders meet with president bush 
on saturday worried that their ocean is becoming a us chemical 
weapons dump and their tiny nations are slipping down the list of 
us aid beneficiaries 
flying in from across the pacific to confer with bush are the 
presidents or prime ministers of nine remote and economically 
vulnerable countries ranging from papua new guinea population 36 
million to nauru a midocean dot supporting 8000 people 
bush who arrives friday scheduled the unprecedented session to 
coincide with a swing through honolulu to campaign for patricia 
saiki a republican congresswoman vying with democratic incumbent 
daniel akaka for a us senate seat 
for months pacific islanders have expressed concern about plans 
to destroy chemical weapons from us far eastern and european 
bases at a giant new incinerator on johnston atoll a usheld 
ring of islands 825 miles southwest of hawaii 
as bush and the pacific leaders meet in two hours of talks 
followed by lunch the latest shipment of such munitions will be 
nearing johnston atoll 
two us navy ships carrying 100000 artillery shells packed 
with nerve agents the us armys stockpile from west germany are 
expected to reach the atoll next month 
the south pacific forum an organization of regional 
governments has complained the plan could make the region the 
toxic waste disposal center of the world 
the environmental group greenpeace usa went to court to block 
the operation but a federal judge last month rejected the 
challenge 
tests of the incinerator are to end late next year and 
fullscale incineration is expected to begin in 1992 the united 
states and soviet union have agreed to destroy such weapons by 
1997 
geoffrey a henry cook islands prime minister and chairman of 
the pacific islands conference another regional organization said 
johnston atoll will be on their minds when he and the other leaders 
meet with bush 
in my view the top concern is the enviromental issue henry 
said in a telephone interview 
a us administration official said in washington on wednesday 
that islanders have been reassured that the destruction of these 
chemical weapons will be carried out in an environmentally safe 
manner 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
johnston atoll and other environmental issues are expected to be a 
major topic at the honolulu talks 
island leaders also want the united states to sign the south 
pacific nuclear free zone treaty banning use testing dumping and 
storage of nuclear weapons and nuclear waste in the region the 
soviet union australia and new zealand are among the nations that 
have signed the protocols 
besides the cooks papua new guinea and nauru the island 
governments represented at the summit with bush will be fiji 
kiribati the marshall islands the federated states of micronesia 
tuvalu and western samoa 
the islanders may also seek reassurances from bush on longterm 
prospects for us development assistance they fear that the 
budget crisis in washington might mean cuts or even the elimination 
of us aid 
because they are ministates us funds for them could get 
squeezed out said michael p hamnett a pacific scholar at the 
university of hawaii 
the aid programs an estimated total of 16 million yearly for 
the islands could be reduced because of american commitments to 
eastern europe central america and the middle east henry said 
we understand the rest of the world needs attention and we in 
the pacific have to learn to live with that he said nothing 
is happening in our region that requires the attention of the 
united states

republican newt gingrich hasnt set foot 
in his congressional district all month there are few gingrich 
campaign posters in his home town of jonesboro gingrich says hes 
been busy in congress 
all of that is fine with democrat david worley whos been 
campaigning against the house republican whip full time for three 
years 
this district is tired of mr gingrich worley says he 
forgot the average american in this district for his washington 
agenda which does not serve the people here at home 
house democrats are tired of their combative nemesis too 
theyve posted a sign in their capitol cloakroom that says make 
the 102nd congress newt free 
the poster features gingrichs photo and a caption calling him 
the most corrupt minority whip in history thats a swipe at 
his frequent descriptions of former house speaker jim wright as the 
most corrupt speaker in american history 
worley a jonesboro attorney won 41 percent of the vote against 
gingrich in 1988 this time hes accusing gingrich of repeatedly 
flipflopping on taxes and neglecting the district 
but gingrich still retains a strong base of support in his 
conservative georgia district and is a heavy favorite for 
reelection 
gingrich who made his name as a fervent antitax crusader last 
visited his district on sept 29 he did find time for a quick 
campaign trip to new jersey this month for a gop colleague 
his spokesman tom blankley blames his absence from georgia on 
the fact that congress has been in session just about nonstop 
for weeks 
political analyst michael binford said gingrich must perform a 
balancing act 
one of the dangerous situations hes in is that if youre an 
ambitious politician and have a national stage and forget the folks 
back home they can punish you for that binford said he 
hasnt ignored them but hes not back here as much as before he 
was made whip 
because gingrich is a controversial figure hes not going to 
breeze to victory as most incumbents do said political scientist 
alan abramowitz of emory university but its really hard to 
unseat an incumbent 
gingrich was elected to the house on his third try in 1978 he 
rose to the no 2 spot in the house gop hierarchy after instigating 
the ethics investigation that led to wrights resignation in 1989 
but then gingrich himself was attacked on ethics grounds 
regarding the publishing deal for his 1984 book window of 
opportunity the house ethics committee said it found no basis 
for a full investigation 
gingrich broke with the white house earlier this month when he 
led the defeat of a budget proposal backed by president bush 
worley who also opposed the budget deal says it was at least 
the fourth time since july that gingrich changed his tax position 
in july house republicans approved a resolution opposing higher 
taxes a day later gingrich supported a 25 billion tax increase 
and promised to use his leadership position to deliver key 
republican votes for it 
but in early august he said he opposed any tax increase he 
later advocated tax cuts to stimulate the economy but his plan 
died 
in opposing the presidents budget proposal gingrich said the 
equation has changed because of the persian gulf crisis and 
increasing evidence that the country is headed for a recession 
worley noting that gingrich supported a 35000 congressional 
pay raise offered his own budget plan repeal the pay raise 
eliminate franked mail and increase income taxes on the wealthiest 
americans 
worley says gingrich missed his most significant opportunity to 
help the district when he refused to back federal intervention in 
the eastern airlines strike the district lost 6000 jobs as a

deep cuts in star wars spending in 1991 will 
delay a white house decision on deploying an antimissile shield by 
at least two years the projects director says 
henry cooper who took over as head of the project just last 
summer has determined that because of the budget squeeze he 
cannot provide the scientific basis for a deployment decision 
before the end of 1994 at the earliest 
shortly after he took office in 1989 bush told the pentagon he 
wanted to be able to decide what kind of star wars defense to build 
by the end of his term in 1992 
coopers spokeswoman maj carolyn channave said wednesday that 
cooper had reached this conclusion on the basis of the 1991 defense 
bill approved on wednesday by the house and expected to be passed 
by the senate this week cooper was not available for comment she 
said 
the spending reduction of about 800 million to a fiveyear low 
of 289 billion also is likely to mean the end of development 
work on some of the exotic weapons that gave the strategic defense 
initiative its star wars nickname 
one expected casualty is the freeelectron laser once 
considered one of the most promising efforts to harness intense 
beams of light for weaponry the powerful laser would bounce its 
beam off a series of orbiting mirrors to zap ballistic missiles 
over the soviet union destroying them moments after liftoff more 
than 700 million has been spent on this project over the past 
seven years 
the budget also may sound the death knell for the xray laser 
powered by the detonation of a hydrogen bomb the xray laser was 
envisioned as firing multiple beams of radiation across space to 
destroy soviet missiles work on this weapon which does not yet 
exist has cost about 1 billion in recent years 
bush had requested 46 billion for sdi for the 1991 budget year 
that began oct 1 the decision by congress to sharply reduce the 
spending total does not mean the project is dead but its pulse is 
slowing and its shape is changing 
sdi was launched by former president reagan in march 1983 and 
became a cornerstone of american defense policy reagan promoted 
the project as a way of rendering nuclear weapons obsolete but the 
bush administration has abandoned the idea of erecting an 
impenetrable antimissile shield 
cooper disclosed earlier this month that he is restructuring sdi 
to attempt to win congressional support for building a limited 
defensive shield one that could stop as many as a couple hundred 
ballistic missiles but not protect against an allout soviet 
nuclear attack a threat most see as receding 
bush said earlier this year that strategic defense was more 
important than ever before but some of sdis most fervent supports 
are now wondering why the president didnt put up a bigger fight 
against congress rush to cut star wars spending 
daniel o graham a former director of the defense intelligence 
agency and chairman of the prosdi group americans for the high 
frontier said the 1991 defense budget deals a devastating blow 
to the project he urged bush to veto it 
bush is not expected to veto the bill in part because defense 
secretary dick cheney said this week he would not recommend 
rejection despite his misgivings on sdi spending 
equally troubling to cooper the sdi director is a provision in 
the bill that would for the first time give congress control over 
how the sdi money is spent cooper has said this will limit his 
ability to apply technologies developed in one area of the project 
such as spacebased interceptors to other areas

the confrontation of multinational forces 
in saudi arabia with iraq in occupied kuwait has the makings of the 
largest tank battle since the classic world war ii struggle at 
kursk on the russian front 
several thousand german and russian tanks fought in that epic 
1943 battle a russian victory that marked the german ebb on the 
eastern front 
iraq has about 430000 troops in kuwait bolstered by an 
estimated 3500 sovietdesigned tanks ranging from the aging t54 
to the more advanced t72 
they face more than 300000 troops in the usled multinational 
force with a tank strength expected to reach 1800 by the end of 
the month 
this month marks the anniversaries of two other famous tank 
battles that helped change the course of wars el alamein in the 
egyptian desert in 1942 and israels armored thrust against the 
egyptians across the suez canal in the 1973 yom kippur conflict 
the british victory at el alamein in which several hundred 
tanks on both sides were deployed turned the tide against adolf 
hitler in the middle east that epic battle pitted british gen 
bernard montgomerys eighth army against the vaunted afrika korps 
of field marshal erwin rommel the desert fox 
the british 7th armored brigade the successors of montgomerys 
7th armored division known as the desert rats are now 
deploying in saudi arabia with their challenger 1 tanks 
the tanks may now be hightech leviathans but the tactics 
differ little from those used back in world war ii veterans of 
desert tank warfare say 
october is also the anniversary of the 1973 middle east war in 
which israeli armored columns crossed the suez canal and encircled 
the entire egyptian 3rd army in a classic tank operation 
an estimated 1200 israeli and egyptians tanks were involved 
the men who fought in el alamein and the 1973 conflict say one 
constant factor in desert tank warfare is the need for air power 
when montgomery took over the first thing he did was to move 
royal air force headquarters alongside his own headquarters said 
retired british army col michael jeffery who fought in the 
western desert campaigns 
if youve got air superiority you have freedom of action and 
to attack the supply lines which is also important at el alamein 
it was complete air superiority he recalled 
zev eitan who served in israels tank forces in the 1948 1956 
1967 and 1973 arabisraeli wars and a veteran of the suez tank 
battle noted in 1967 once we had mastery of the sky our air 
force could help and we just had to follow to exploit the success 
of the air force 
air superiority was also important in the 1973 war since in 
the desert you dont have so much cover he said 
eitan was a battalion commander in the 1973 conflict and is now 
a consultant at israels jaffe center for strategic studies 
the iraqi forces of saddam hussein are deployed in defensive 
positions behind a shield of antitank ditches earthworks and 
minefields 
the iraqis are master military engineers whose digin tactics 
were perfected during their 198088 war with neighboring iran 
for most of that war however iraqi tanks were used in a static 
role as artillery rather than in the running battles that western 
forces are trained to fight 
tanks of the multinational force include usbuilt m60s and the 
topoftheline abrams tank in several configurations as well as 
the desert rats uptodate british challenger tanks 
the multinational force tanks are generally far more advanced 
than those of the iraqis whose t54 is based on a 1947 soviet 
model 
technology makes a vast difference said jeffery ours is 
better than saddams 
providing air cover for the the multinational force tanks are 
hundreds of groundattack jets and tankkiller helicopters 
iraq also has hundreds of groundattack jets and attack 
helicopters but it is unclear how many could be used for armor 
support operations 
since iraq has a twotoone edge in tanks another major factor 
especially in an area where resupply is problematic is 
retaining control of the battlefield once the running clash of 
steel has subsided 
this is important in armored warfare because not all tanks 
hit are a total loss said eitan if you remain in control of 
the battlefield you can repair some of your tank casualties

two attacks on key military 
garrisons appear to signal the beginning of a major rebel 
offensive but it might not be the sort of onslaught the guerrillas 
initiated out last year 
residents of the capital have been on edge since the end of the 
rainy season the period starting in the fall when most guerrilla 
offensives have begun during the 11yearold civil war 
last november guerrillas mounted an assault in parts of the 
capital that continued for three weeks and was their biggest 
offensive of the war 
military and rebel sources indicate the pattern of this years 
attacks might be different 
instead of entrenching themselves in densely populated 
neighborhoods the guerrillas plan an escalating series of 
hitandrun attacks on selected military targets the sources say 
a more sustained effort to rout the armed forces might follow 
the attacks the sources say 
the new rebel campaign opened with a thunderous 20minute mortar 
barrage early oct 17 on the main air force base at ilopango on 
the citys eastern edge 
nearly two hours of combat between paratroopers and retreating 
rebels ensued the firefight struck panic in residents of the 
eastern neighborhoods where the fighting in last years offensive 
was fiercest 
but by dawn the zone had returned to relative normalcy 
the attack on ilopango left five soldiers wounded and damaged 
six helicopters according to the air force the rebel farabundo 
marti national liberation front said it had damaged 24 helicopters 
the capital was rattled again tuesday afternoon by two powerful 
explosions a botched guerrilla attack on the military compound in 
the citys southern sector that houses the defense ministry and the 
joint chiefs of staff 
both homemade mortar rounds fell some 150 yards short of their 
target onto a private house the mortars killed two children and 
wounded three adults 
rumors of an offensive have been circulating since july the 
army has been on a high state of alert for months cancelling 
leaves stepping up patrols beefing up base security and setting 
up new checkpoints and roadblocks 
hours before the attack on ilopango the defense minister col 
rene emilio ponce said in a televised interview we have good 
information that they the rebels are indeed preparing an 
offensive of a type different from that of last year according to 
our information it is going to be more selective and will involve 
more firepower 
fmln leaders say the offensive is aimed at spurring talks to end 
the war 
it will be necessary to carry out extraordinary military 
operations to increase the level of military action in order to 
give impetus to peace negotiations said salvador samayoa an 
fmln leader said last week 
representatives of the rightist government of president alfredo 
cristiani and the fmln have held five rounds of peace talks since 
may the talks scheduled to resume nov 4 in mexico have bogged 
down over bitterly differing positions on the future role of the 
armed forces 
in an effort to force both sides to the bargaining table the 
us senate voted friday to halve the 85 million aid package to el 
salvadors military and promised to cut aid altogether if the 
government withdrew from peace talks 
if the rebelsfail to demonstrate good faith in negotiations 
or launch a major offensive the slashed 425 million would be 
restored 
an earlier version of the bill would have restored the aid if 
the rebels refused a government offer for a ceasefire but it was 
rejected 
the rebels say there is no point in a ceasefire until 
negotiations have achieved major changes in salvadoran society 
they want a drastic purge and reduction of the armed forces in 
exchange for their own demoblization 
the government says it will not agree to measures that undermine 
the armed forces integrity and insists that the military do any 
housecleaning it deems necessary

three highranking women in the bush 
administration and a house member are among the names being 
mentioned as possible successors to elizabeth dole as secretary of 
labor 
mrs dole 54 became the first of president bushs cabinet 
secretaries to depart when she resigned wednesday to become 
president of the american red cross 
the white house said it had not settled on a possible nominee or 
talked to any of the likely contenders 
we continue to look at candidates and consider people and 
search for the best person said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
one person frequently mentioned is rep lynn martin rill 
should she lose her bid to oust democratic sen paul simon in the 
nov 6 election 
asked if martin was on the list fitzwater replied 
everybodys on the list 
other possible contenders that consistently come up are 
constance newman head of the office of personnel management 
elaine chao who holds the no 2 job at the transportation 
department and constance horner undersecretary of health and 
human services horner also served as opm director under former 
president reagan 
observers speculated that if newman who oversees the 
governments 24millionmember workforce were to get the nod 
bush might look to social security administrator gwen king to 
replace her at opm that would allow the administration to promote 
two black women at the same time 
a labor department aide speaking on condition of anonymity 
said officials did not expect bush to name a successor at least 
until after election day that way if a loyal republican making a 
bid for higher office lost the president could reward him or her 
with a cabinet job the aide said 
in addition officials noted there was no rush to fill the job 
because mrs dole will remain on the job until nov 23 in 
addition if congress adjourns this week as scheduled the senate 
which must confirm any cabinet secretary wouldnt be back until 
january to give its approval anyway 
at a white house news conference wednesday mrs dole said the 
choice of her successor was up to the president what the 
president and i have discussed i think has to remain between the 
two of us 
mrs dole who is the highestranking woman in the 
administration said that after 25 years of government service she 
was looking forward to focusing on humanitarian causes at her new 
job at the american red cross 
she denied she had been frozen out by white house policymakers 
aides and union leaders have said she had little clout at bushs 
cabinet table and many labor policy decisions were left to 
presidential chief of staff john sununu 
i cant imagine who was saying this most definitely i 
feel very much a part of the circle thats making the decisions 
here at the white house mrs dole said after announcing her 
resignation with the president at her side 
later in an interview mrs dole testily labeled those reports 
totally erroneous 
its been a wonderful relationship she said of her ties to 
white house aides 
she said such officials as sununu and budget director richard 
darman naturally have a close working relationship with the 
president but my issues obviously im the one carrying the 
ball im the one developing the strategy she said 
mrs dole wife of senate republican leader bob dole rkan 
also denied that she might use the 185000ayear red cross 
position to lay the groundwork for longterm political goals 
im on my way to the red cross i have no plans to run for 
anything she said rumors have been rampant that she would 
eventually step down to run in 1992 for the senate seat now held by 
democrat terry sanford of her native north carolina 
in the interview she did not rule out some future bid for 
elective office saying you learn in this town never to say 
never

a new study finds that farmers will be in for 
some harder times under the 1990 farm bill the national farmers 
union says 
the analysis by economist daryll ray of oklahoma state 
university shows that a farmer with a 350acre wheat base and a net 
income of 15787 in 1990 could see income drop more than 1000 in 
1991 based on current prices and costs 
by 1995 the fifth year of the new farm bill the annual 
reduction in net income from current levels would be nearly 4000 
according to the study distributed wednesday by the farm 
organization 
the reduction in net income would result mostly from provisions 
in the legislation that reduce the amount of acreage eligible for 
government deficiency payments 
those are subsidies to make up the difference between market 
prices and target levels the acreage cuts involved a triple 
base option so farmers can plant what they choose on that 
acreage those crops however are not eligible for deficiency 
payments 
specific cuts in the commodity programs were provided in the 
farm bill but were also tied to the passage of the budgetreduction 
measure that is aimed at cutting federal spending by 500 billion 
over the next five years 
the agriculture departments share of that reduction is 136 
billion and includes the cutbacks in commodity price support 
operations cited in the study circulated by the national farmers 
union 
i dont know how anybody who purports to represent farmers 
be they in congress in the administration or in farm and commodity 
organizations could support this farm bill nfu president 
leland swenson said in a statement it will absolutely devastate 
rural america and these numbers show the unfair share of budget 
cuts farmers would shoulder 
in all according to the nfu deficit reduction may cost the 
average taxpayer as much as 100 to 300 per year but farmers who 
also are taxpayers may end up contributing many times those 
amounts because of reduced income 
most farm organizations have been saying all along that the 
136 billion reduction in usda programs over five years will mean 
reductions in net farm income 
the national farmers organization for example said last week 
that the lowprice policies advocated by the bush administration 
were bargaining tools in the current negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
nfo president devon r woodland said the drive by the 
administration to get the european community to go along with 
subsidy cutbacks will fail and that congress will have to 
reconsider the farm bill after the gatt talks end on dec 31 
the national grange has said the 136 billion cut ordered for 
usda programs represented unilateral disarmament by the united 
states in the trade talks the granges national master robert 
barrow said the costs of trimming the budget deficit should be 
borne more equitably 
rob nooter of the american farm bureau federations washington 
office said wednesday that the farm bill and its tie to the 500 
billion budgetreduction package is certainly going to have an 
impact on farm income 
some of the income lost from reduced deficiency payments will be 
made up by other features of the 1990 farm bill but not all of it 
he said 
federation president dean kleckner said last week that he wasnt 
happy with all of the farm bill but urged its adoption 
although farm program budget cuts are disproportionate and we 
accept them with great reluctance the bill will continue 
agricultural market orientation and give farmers greater planting 
flexibility he said 
 
washington ap the 1990 farm law will be a prime topic of 
discussion as the agriculture department unlimbers its annual 
outlook conference next month 
it will be the 67th usda meeting for economists farm leaders 
commodity experts and others to look at what may be forthcoming in 
the year ahead this years session is nov 2729 
the opening day will include talks by agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter and deputy secretary of state lawrence s 
eagleberger conference officials said wednesday 
they will be followed by sidney l jones assistant secretary of 
the treasury for economic policy who will present the economic 
outlook for 1991 usda officials will discuss prospects for 
farmers consumers and agricultural exports 
other firstday events will include a panel discussion on 
european and soviet union affairs 
commodity prospects and the outlok under new farm legislation 
will be highlights during the remainder of the conference along 
with environmental and energy issues 
among the forecasts will be usdas first for consumer food 
prices in 1991 and its predictions for exports and farm income 
the impact of higher oil prices will be a major factor in the 
1991 farm income forecast energy also will be important in looking 
ahead at retail food prices 
 
washington ap production of farmraised catfish dropped 9 
percent last month from a year earlier to 276 million pounds 
according to a monthly report by the agriculture department 
however the report said the average price paid by processors to 
growers in september was 78 cents per pound up 13 cents from a 
year ago 
on a cumulative basis catfish farmers delivered about 2778 
million pounds of catfish to processors through september compared 
with 2553 million pounds in the same nine months of 1989 
imports of freshwater catfish mostly from brazil are down from 
a year ago the report said imports in august the most recent 
month calculated totaled 362000 pounds down 14 percent from a 
year earlier

republicans are bracing themselves for 
election day losses and conservatives are ready to lay the blame at 
the feet of president bush 
with less than two weeks remaining before the polls open 
polling data from a wide range of states points to growing support 
for democratic candidates 
a month ago i would have said we were going to win one or two 
seats in the senate said david keene a republican political 
consultant and conservative activist i think now were going to 
lose two and it could be more 
keene also predicted wednesday that gop losses in the house 
would be a lot worse than anybody thought and he said its 
traceable to one person and thats the president of the united 
states 
lyn nofziger white house political director during the reagan 
administration said he thought the election was breaking for the 
democrats and that one problem was that if im an independent 
voter if im not a party erson george bush hasnt given me much 
reason to go out and support his party 
going into the election democrats control the senate by a 
margin of 5545 and the house by 258176 republicans had hoped to 
trim the senate margin and hold their house losses to fewer than 10 
seats 
but the budget negotiations proved a disaster for republicans 
conservatives rebelled against bushs decision to drop his 
hardline opposition to any tax increases and helped defeat a 
compromise package worked out between the white house and the 
congressional leadership 
then the president appeared unable to make up his mind on 
whether he would or would not agree to increasing the tax load on 
the rich 
while all that was happening the democrats succeeded in 
reinforcing a public perception of the republicans as the party 
that cared more about the wealthy than the middle class 
douglas bailey a republican media consultant called the 
longrunning budget negotiations a mild form of disaster for 
republicans 
the presidents image is awful said bailey the president 
does not look in charge 
there does seem to be a marked movement toward the democratic 
party largely because of the fairness issue said rep jim 
leach riowa 
in a recent newsweek poll 65 percent of the people said they 
thought bush was more concerned about wealthy americans than he 
should be 
in the last 10 days republicans have taken a nosedive said 
rep vin weber rminn who believed the republicans should hold 
to a hard line against tax increases 
its not possible for the republican party to win the public 
relations battle over fairness said weber people are inclined 
to believe that the republican party is the party of the rich more 
than the democratic party 
the minnesota congressman said that my advice to every 
republican candidate is to get back to republican basics 
the white house showed some displeasure wednesday at the growing 
tendency an almost frantic scramble by republican candidates to 
put some distance between themselves and the president 
if they can sleep with their conscience let them try said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
poll results that have republicans nervous include these 
in oregon democrat harry lonsdale leads sen mark hatfield 50 
to 44 percent in a survey conducted late last week a new survey in 
the governors race has democrat barbara roberts taking a 
fourpoint lead over republican dave frohnmayer bidding for a 
fifth senate term hatfield got 67 percent of the vote six years 
ago lonsdale a wealthy businessman began the race as a virtually 
unknown longshot 
in minnesota a new poll shows democrat paul wellstone pulling 
to within 3 points of sen rudy boschwitz who began the campaign 
rated one of the safe republicans boschwitz aides insist their 
internal polls say it isnt that close 
sen john kerry dmass who was looking like a possible 
victim of virulent antiincumbent sentiment holds a 14point lead 
over republican challenger jim rappaport the race was a dead heat 
in polls two weeks ago 
also in massachusetts a new survey puts democrat john silber 
six points ahead of republican william weld in the race for 
governor 
in ohio democrat tony celebrezze said an internal poll shows 
him leading republican george voinovich in the race for governor 
independent polls have said voinovich was holding a doubledigit 
lead through most of the race 
democrat harvey gantt continues to lead republican sen jesse 
helms in north carolina the latest survey put gantts lead at 
eight points

an antismoking group praised the environmental 
protection agency for reinstating a scientist who had been 
dismissed from an advisory panel under pressure from the tobacco 
industry 
the epa said wednesday that dr david burns of the university of 
california at san diego had been reinstated to a panel on the 
health effects of others smoke 
mark pertschuk executive director of americans for nonsmokers 
rights in berkeley calif said he was delighted with the 
decision 
i think it was the only ethical thing at this point that they 
could do he said to have given in to the tobacco industry 
would have been a horrible statement about the impartiality of the 
peer review process 
but an industry spokeswoman complained that burns reinstatement 
would endanger the panels ability to do its work fairly 
david burns cannot be considered to be an objective party in 
this issue and that is very well documented said tobacco 
institute spokeswoman brennan dawson we have a panelist that 
doesnt belong 
burns said he was pleased by the turn of events 
i think it reflects the epa reconsidering the importance of 
the public policy decision they were making he said 
i think that the information they received from the press and 
the scientific community was that there was a tremendous concern 
about the influence of the tobacco industry on this kind of 
scientific panel 
burns has worked on the surgeon generals reports on the dangers 
of smoking since the 1970s he was editor of the 1986 report on 
passive smoking 
he was dismissed recently from a panel chosen to review two 
forthcoming epa reports on the health effects of secondhand 
cigarette smoke 
the tobacco industry and rep thomas bliley rva a tobacco 
industry ally had lobbied vigorously to remove burns from the 
committee of the epas scientific advisory board a standing group 
of independent experts 
steven bayard manager of the epas project on passive smoking 
said he had never such a response to industry pressure in his 12 
years at the epa 
after the success of the tobacco industrys lobbying effort was 
disclosed last week donald barnes the scientific advisory boards 
staff director asked the boards executive committee to advise him 
on whether to reappoint burns according to epa officials who spoke 
on condition they not be named 
the executive committee voted unanimously to reinstate burns 
the officials said 
barnes did not return telephone calls to his office 
burns was originally told on aug 10 that he had been appointed 
to the panel and had received drafts of the passive smoking 
reports before his ouster the panels job is to review the reports 
to assure their scientific accuracy 
the tobacco institute wrote epa administrator william reilly on 
aug 10 protesting burns selection 
frankly we are mystified how an individual with dr burns 
long and intense involvement with the antismoking movement can be 
expected to contribute to a reasonable objective examination 
the letter said 
bliley didnt mention burns by name in his letter to the epa on 
sept 18 but said the panel should consist of qualified 
individuals who have not already prejudged this issue in any 
manner epa officials said they understood that to be an 
objection to burns

civil rights forces plan a fresh fight next 
year for the job discrimination bill that president bush vetoed on 
grounds it would result in hiring quotas 
like macarthur we shall return and we expect to win 
civil rights leader benjamin hooks said wednesday after the senate 
sustained the veto by a onevote margin 
eleven republicans joined 55 democrats as the senate voted 6634 
for the override it thus fell one vote short of the twothirds 
needed to enact the bill despite the presidents objections 
it was bushs 16th veto in 21 months as president he has been 
sustained in all 11 override attempts by congress 
hooks president of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people said the bill as introduced next year would be 
similar or identical to the 1990 version 
six supreme court decisions that caused a furor when they were 
handed down last year would be negated under the bill 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme discrimination 
cases 
bush said he wanted to sign a civil rights bill and was willing 
to go along with a ban on harassment along with other provisions 
but he would not agree to intricate features that would make it 
easier to win race and sex discrimination cases against employers 
he said they were so stringent that employers would turn to 
quota hiring to provide themselves with a readymade defense if 
sued for discrimination 
sponsors denied to the end that the bill would result in quotas 
sen edward m kennedy dmass called the quota argument a 
sham 
the president has taken the low road on civil rights but that 
is no reason for the senate to take it too sen edward m 
kennedy dmass said in a lastditch appeal for support 
but senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the bill would 
enable lawyers to reap huge profits in the name of racial 
justice and result in quotas quotas quotas and more 
employment quotas 
republican critics of the bill expressed dismay that they were 
not able to vote on a more moderate measure but they said the bill 
vetoed by bush would go too far 
it swings the pendulum too far against employers and in favor 
of employees said sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
sen arlen specter rpa a supporter of the bill suggested 
that a vote to sustain bush could unseat some senators up for 
reelection 
and sen bob packwood rore suggested the president could 
persuade voters his veto was a necessity if he cant convince 
people it is a quota bill then i think its a loser for him 
packwood said 
sen brock adams dwash said it as a political move to try 
to get to conservative democratic bluecollar workers i think 
its bush listening to his political advisers and shame on him it 
was a cold political decision 
former ku klux klan leader david duke a republican state 
legislator in louisiana watched the proceedings from a frontrow 
seat in the senate visitors gallery 
duke who this month lost his bid for a us senate seat told 
reporters he was opposed to the bill because it would 
discriminate against qualified white americans 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said dukes 
appearance has nothing to do with us we disavow david duke in 
every way shape or form absolutely

congress is sending president bush a bill 
calling for 287 million in new spending to encourage volunteerism 
and community service turning aside complaints about the cost 
bush is expected to sign the legislation its house and senate 
sponsors say 
the compromise national and community service act passed the 
house on a 235186 vote wednesday the senate approved the 
agreement last week after it emerged from a congressional 
conference committee 
this bill at least for now signals a change from the me 
generation of the 1980s to a community service ethic i hope will 
pervade america in the 1990s said rep mel levine dcalif 
republicans attacked the bill as unwarranted and wasteful 
spending at a time when congress was struggling with a bill to 
raise taxes 
rep marge roukema rnj said congress was wrong to authorize 
such new spending when budget constraints have prevented it from 
fully funding existing programs for children and the poor 
has the congress of the united states gone bonkers asked 
rep steve gunderson rwis 
people wonder why the american public is upset with the 
congress he said ill tell you why theyre upset because 
they dont understand this kind of drunkenness with new bureaucracy 
and new spending 
only 22 republicans joined democrats in supporting the bill 41 
democrats opposed it 
sen edward kennedy dmass praised the bill as a call to 
action for the nation john buchanan head of the liberal group 
people for the american way commended bushs support for the 
measure and said not since john kennedy has a president championed 
community service as bush has 
the bill authorizes spending 62 million in the current fiscal 
year 105 million in fiscal 1992 and 120 million in fiscal 1993 
for national and community service programs 
a part of the measure is a 5 million authorization to begin a 
thousand points of light foundation to encourage volunteerism 
taking its name from bushs phrase for volunteers 
among the key elements 
a new parttime program encouraging community service by young 
people established through schools and community organizations 
such as the ymca or the united way it would encourage adults to 
volunteer in schools and communitybased service programs 
money would go in grants to state education agencies which 
would distribute it to schools and service groups 
an expansion of youth corps programs to increase fulltime 
service opportunities young people would be put in teams to work 
on projects cleaning the environment helping the hungry and 
homeless and aiding the poor some 60 conservation or youth corps 
programs now are operating locally 
a program to encourage colleges to make community service 
programs available to their students 
a greatly reduced version of a civilian national service corps 
proposed two years ago by sens sam nunn dga and charles robb 
dva a test program would provide 5000 in education assistance 
in return for a years fulltime service at a subsistence wage 
also available would be 1000 for education or home down payment 
in exchange for a year of parttime civilian service to be matched 
by another 1000 from the state

four architects who won a 20000 contest to 
design a korean war veterans memorial saw the government turn the 
plan into a battle scene that glorifies war their lawyer says 
architects have to have some faith that when they enter a 
design competition and win then thats what its going to be 
attorney robert sokolove said in an interview wednesday you 
cant change the rules in the middle 
particularly galling to the architects is that the new version 
depicts soldiers in battleready positions sokolove said the 
original plan called for a dreamlike collection of 38 soldiers 
moving some unevenly across a remote landscape toward an american 
flag 
the architects are fighting to have the original design 
restored sokolove said he learned of the changes two months ago 
when they were presented by a washington architectural firm that he 
thought had been retained only to implement the earlier plans 
but col william ryan director of operations and finance for 
the american battle monuments commission said wednesday that the 
new model is so far superior to the other design its 
unbelievable the commission erects and maintains memorials 
honoring american soldiers 
the new design retains the essential elements of the old one 
adding a pool pathways and benches and cutting back bushes all 
to accommodate large numbers of visitors ryan said 
sokolove said the new circular pathways look like an i95 
interchange 
he represents four pennsylvania state university architects who 
beat out 1018 competitors last year to design the memorial across 
the reflecting pool from the vietnam veterans memorial 
president bush was the guest of honor as a oneeighth scale 
model was unveiled at the white house on june 14 1989 the entry 
was declared the winner of a 20000 prize by a jury of korean war 
veterans 
the soldiers were to show the experience of moving into and 
through war according to the architects original design 
statement 
but the redesign no longer alludes to the struggle and 
sacrifice of walking a hostile landscape but instead glorifies 
war by depicting a battle said a statement delivered by the 
architects to president bushs aides last month 
the changes were ordered by the national capital planning 
commission the commission of fine arts and the interior 
department ryan said also playing a role in the final design he 
said were korean war veterans serving on the panel that selected 
the design 
the main thing is the 38 heroic statues of ground combat 
personnel theyre still there ryan said he said the final 
design was submitted by the cooperlecky architectural firm of 
washington 
sokolove said the government was still using a photograph of the 
original design to raise funds for the project but ryan said that 
is only because photos of the new model are not ready 
originally budgeted at 6 million the memorial is now expected 
to cost 149 million according to ryan organizers hope to have a 
dedication in 1993 
some 57 million americans served in korea during the 195053 
conflict and more than 54000 were killed 
the controversy recalls the designing of the vietnam war 
memorial a vocal group backed by theninterior secretary james 
watt opposed the 1982 design as unheroic the group won a 
concession when a statue of three soldiers was added in 1984 near 
the vshaped wall bearing the names of more than 58000 americans 
killed in the war

donald e lukens final days in congress were 
spent out of public view on the telephone with people urging him 
to resign rather than face a second sexual misconduct 
investigation 
he didnt appear at the house on tuesday or wednesday he 
slipped out of his congressional office monday before the house 
ethics committee announced it had reopened his case because of a 
new complaint that he sexually harassed a capitol elevator 
operator 
lukens last official action was a letter of resignation 
transmitted to ohio gov richard celeste shortly after 1130 am 
wednesday 
effective immediately for the good of the congress and the 
integrity of the institution i resign my seat in the us house of 
representatives sincerely buz 
a top aide said lukens stayed away from capitol hill but kept in 
contact with supporters staff his attorney and party leaders via 
telephone 
house republican leader robert michel was among those who 
convinced lukens defeated for renomination in ohios may primary 
that he faced an expulsion vote unless he stepped down 
ethics committee spokeswoman jan keyes said lukens would not 
have lost his retirement benefits even if he had been expelled 
lukens will qualify for a pension of more than 2000 a month 
beginning in 1993 under the federal pension system his payment is 
determined by combining his congressional service with his 6 years 
in the air force and two years on a congressional staff 
lukens resigned two days after the ethics committee revived its 
dormant case against him to include the new accusation that he 
fondled a house elevator operator earlier this month 
a source who spoke with the elevator operator said she alleged 
that lukens approached her more than once on the same day after 
fondling her lukens gave the woman his business card and asked her 
to call him the source said 
the elevator operator reported the incident to her superiors 
she was given leave with pay and assured she would not have to 
return to work as long as lukens was around the capitol said the 
source who requested anonymity 
the ethics committee earlier had been examining whether lukens 
had violated house rules by having sex with a 16yearold girl an 
episode that led to a misdemeanor conviction in ohio last year 
the 59yearold congressman who is divorced has been free on 
bond while appealing to the state supreme court 
lukens office operations will continue until his successor is 
chosen 
ohio law requires the governor to call a special election even 
though only 10 weeks remain in his term a primary must be held if 
more than candidate in a party files nominating petitions 
the two men vying to replace lukens both indicated theyll run 
in the special election republican nominee john boehner is viewed 
as having the edge over democrat gregory jolivette 
if the same candidate wins both the special election and the 
nov 6 vote he would get a leg up on the house freshman class of 
1991 office space for instance is determined by seniority thus 
someone who takes office in november would be ahead of those who 
arrive in january 
party leaders pressed lukens for more than a year to resign but 
he ignored them they largely reacted with relief wednesday 
im just sorry it took so long to do the right thing by the 
people of the 8th district said ohio gop chairman robert 
bennett 
i think he was wrong to remain in office said donald 
birgel a party official from lukens home base butler county 
ohio it was selfish of him 
lukens served in congress from 1967 to 1970 when he made an 
unsuccessful attempt to gain the republican gubernatorial 
nomination in ohio after 15 years in the state senate he returned 
to congress in 1986 
he was diagnosed as having throat cancer in 1984 and was given 
just weks to live but battled back and successfully ran for 
congress two years later

congress is beginning a gradual winding down 
of us support for covert conflicts in the third world with an 
intelligence bill that curbs money flowing to rebels in 
afghanistan cambodia and angola 
on a voice vote the house on wednesday gave its endorsement to 
the compromise bill which provides roughly 30 billion for 
intelligence activities around the globe and institutes reforms 
growing out of the irancontra affair 
the senate followed suit early today sending the bill to 
president bush rep gerald solomon rny said that while bush 
does not like parts of the measure he may hold his nose and let 
the bill become law 
on the covert paramilitary conflicts the bill reflected a 
growing congressional skepticism about such expensive and thorny 
involvements and the evaporation of ussoviet tensions that was 
the rationale for an american role 
according to sources familiar with the bill and to limited 
sections made public it 
provides that us covert weapons supplies to the unita rebels 
in angola could be suspended if the marxist government in luanda 
agrees to free elections and a ceasefire and the soviet union 
halts its own weapons shipments to the government it would be up 
to the president to decide whether those conditions have been met 
the provision was a scaledback version of restrictions that had 
been adopted by the house during an unusual public debate last week 
on the aid program which is technically secret 
half of the lethal aid would be put into a restricted account 
subject to release only on approval of the congressional 
intelligence committees weapons aid represents roughly half the 
60 million annual us support for the rebels 
suspends the covert aid program to noncommunist rebels 
fighting the moscowbacked government of cambodia the program 
which sources say amounts to about 13 million will be phased out 
early in 1991 and converted into an open program of humanitarian 
aid to the rebels and to other cambodians 
lawmakers are worried that aid to the rebels is finding its way 
to the infamous khmer rouge who were responsible for the killings 
ofmmore than a million cambodians during their rule in the late 
1970s the countrys warring parties are working with the united 
nations to set up a provisional government in december that would 
then organize national elections 
trims aid to the mujaheddin the rebels fighting the 
sovietbacked government of afghanistan from bushs request for 
300 million to 250 million that compares with 280 million last 
year 
the aid also will be split into two sixmonth increments this 
will give an opportunity for the united states to end the 
assistance at midyear if talks between secretary of state james a 
baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze result in 
agreement on a mutual aid suspension 
the intelligence bill also includes provisions intended to head 
off a recurrence of a scandal like the irancontra affair which 
came to public attention in 1986 
the section includes a new definition of covert action an 
operation undertaken by the united states in another country to 
influence political economic or military conditions abroad in a 
way that the us role is not acknowledged publicly 
under the new provisions any covert action must be approved by 
the president in advance in writing in a document known as a 
finding the finding must state that the action is necessary to 
support us foreign policy objectives and must be reported to 
congressional overseers in a timely fashion 
the finding also must spell out which us agencies will be 
involved and whether any outside party will be enlisted in the 
operation the covert action may not be used to influence domestic 
political processes or public opinion and may not violate the 
constitution 
in the irancontra affair congressional investigators found 
that a cabal of zealots inside the executive branch had 
commandeered policymaking set up operations outside normal 
government controls and failed to notify congress of efforts to 
trade arms for us hostages in iran and generate money to supply 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said the provisions in the new bill really put that 
chapter behind us im really pleased that we now have some 
positive tangible results from those long investigations that were 
undertaken it is perhaps the most significant part of the bill

a dozen senate incumbents who face the voters 
in two weeks enjoy better than 9to1 fundraising edges over 
opponents according to a survey that indicates spending in a 
handful of senate races has or likely will pass 10 million 
in addition to the 12 senators with the whopping fundraising 
advantages another nine incumbents up for reelection had raised 
at least double the amounts of their challengers common cause said 
in one of its periodic analyses of campaign finances 
when it comes to our political system rich incumbents are 
getting richer and poor challengers are getting poorer common 
cause president fred wertheimer said wednesday in a statement 
released with the survey 
in the 27 senate races in which incumbents faced opposition the 
incumbents enjoyed edges in all major fundraising areas common 
cause said that includes a 4to1 edge in political action 
committee contributions incumbents on average were outspending 
challengers by more than 3to1 the group said 
the only incumbent trailing a challenger in fundraising was 
sen daniel akaka of hawaii a democrat who was appointed to the 
seat in may akaka is facing his former house colleague republican 
rep pat saiki as of sept 30 she had raised 88300 to akakas 
821000 
common cause which compiled the information from the latest 
campaign reports to the federal election commission said four 
senate incumbents with no major party opposition this fall had at 
least 850000 in their campaign coffers as of sept 30 
common cause is one of the major lobbying forces behind 
legislation designed to restrict or eliminate political action 
committee contributions and take other steps to cut the 
fundraising advantages of incumbency but the legislation appears 
dead for the year as congress rushes to adjourn before the nov 6 
elections 
in its latest study the organization said combined spending in 
several senate races had or was heading past the 10 million mark 
the costliest race so far has been the north carolina contest 
between republican sen jesse helms and democrat harvey gantt as 
of sept 30 the cutoff date for the latest reports to the federal 
election commission gantt and helms had spent a combined 169 
million 
in texas the matchup of democrat hugh parmer and heavily 
favored republican sen phil gramm had cost a combined 109 
million spending in the illinois contest pitting democratic sen 
paul simon against republican rep lynn martin totaled nearly 107 
million 
the new jersey race pitting democratic sen bill bradley against 
longshot republican christine todd whitman had combined spending of 
91 million as of sept 30 and spending in the massachusetts race 
pitting democratic sen john kerry against gop nominee jim 
rappaport was nearing 8 million at the filing cutoff 
the dozen incumbents enjoying at least a 9to1 fundraising 
edge heading into the final five weeks of the election cycle were 
democratic sens joseph biden of delaware bradley david boren of 
oklahoma albert gore jr of tennessee and jay rockefeller of west 
virginia also republican sens ted stevens of alaska nancy 
kassebaum of kansas rudy boschwitz of minnesota pete domenici of 
new mexico strom thurmond of south carolina gramm and alan 
simpson of wyoming 
the nine incumbents who had at least doubled the fundraising of 
their challengers but not reached a 9to1 edge are democrats 
howard heflin of alabama simon j bennett johnston of louisiana 
kerry carl levin of michigan and max baucus of montana and 
republicans dan coats of indiana mitch mcconnell of kentucky and 
helms johnston already has won his race through louisianas unique 
open primary system 
democrats sam nunn of georgia and david pryor of arkansas and 
republicans thad cochran of mississippi and john warner of virginia 
face no major opposition in their reelection bids

if soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
needs a break from economic headaches at home hes likely to find 
it in the warmth of adoring spaniards during a threeday visit that 
begins friday 
he also comes in search of real economic help reciprocal 
agreements are ready for signing and madrid is offering 
stateguaranteed credits of up to 1 billion for the purchase of 
spanish consumer and industrial goods 
the first spanish visit by a soviet head of state aims to put 
relations between the two countrieson an equal footing with 
moscows ties to other major western nations foreign minister 
francisco fernandez said 
the gorbachev visit is very important because it comes at a 
time of great changes in the world especially in europe said 
juan antonio yanez adviser to socialist prime minister felipe 
gonzalez 
and its a time when the soviet union finds itself at a 
crucial moment in its economic and political development he 
said 
gorbachev is to be accompanied by his wife raisa foreign 
minister eduard shevarnadze and a number of top economic political 
and cultural advisers 
soviet historian svetlana podzarskaya who is accompanying 
gorbachev told spanish reporters in moscow that both sides feel an 
urgency to deepen relations 
spain and the soviet union remained outside the european 
process of economic and political development for many years for 
political reasons podzarskaya said 
now we both have entered spain did it earlier and with more 
success she said referring to madrids 1986 entry into the 
european economic community were just starting along the 
path 
the soviet leaders popularity is running particularly high in 
spain in the wake of his recent nobel peace prize and opposition 
politicans from conservatives to traditional communists are 
jockeying for photo opportunities with gorbachev 
officials at two madrid universities awarding him honorary 
degrees are battling for the right to host the joint awards 
ceremony the soviets suggested a neutral site 
gorbachev is to sign a key joint political statement 
underscoring the two countries commitment to broad european unity 
and cooperation and strengthening of world security 
we go to spain in acknowledgement of spains creative and 
growing role in the development of european and noneuropean 
policy gorbachev told reporters in moscow on monday 
there is a deep reserve of good feeling among spaniards toward 
the soviet union madrid university international relations prof 
roberto mesas said 
spaniards particularly on the left remember the soviets 
political and military support for the democratic 193139 second 
republic during the 193639 civil war 
the war was sparked by a military rebellion led by gen 
francisco franco and resulted in nearly 40 years of rightwing 
dictatorship under franco that ended only with his death in 1975 
political parties were banned and communists in particular 
suffered from the repression 
a year after francos death the communist party was legalized 
in 1977 spain held its first democratic elections since 1936 and 
restored the diplomatic relations with the soviet union cut for 
four decades 
people recall warmly the soviet military support for the 
elected government during the civil war at a time when the french 
and british appeared to take a noninterventionist stance that 
condemned spain to dictatorship mesas said 
key accords to be signed during gorbachevs visit include one on 
reciprocal investment guarantees and another on joint development 
of tourism a key spanish industry and the nations chief foreign 
currency earner 
other accords will set up regular meetings between government 
ministers and officials top military brass and cultural officials 
as well as the establishment of culture centers

already strained usisraeli relations are 
under new pressures following the bush administrations second 
vote against israel in the united nations despite a plea for 
understanding from jerusalem 
secretary of state james a baker iii and others in the 
administration who would like to see israel negotiate with 
palestinians arabs will try to repair the damage before it 
destroys any chance for getting those talks started 
but israel which has depended on us support in a world 
organization largely hostile to the jewish state is bound to feel 
even more anxious about risking negotiations with only the bush 
administration for protection 
the security council voted unanimously wednesday to rebuke 
israel for rejecting a un mission to investigate the killings of 
19 palestinian arabs in jerusalem the vote followed israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs rejection of an appeal from president 
bush to allow the investigation 
it was the second time the united states turned against its old 
friend over the oct 8 incident on the temple mount 
the administration sponsored the initial security council 
resolution adopted unanimously oct 12 which condemned israel and 
directed un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to send 
investigators to jerusalem 
bush in his letter to shamir urged the israeli leader to 
reverse the israeli cabinets decision not to cooperate in the 
inquiry 
but shamir and israeli diplomats in jerusalem and in washington 
informed the administration the decision was based on two 
principles that could not be reversed us officials and other 
sources told the associated press on wednesday 
one was that the security council had already condemned israel 
so the inquiry could hardly be an openminded one the other was 
that admitting the un investigators could challenge the 
sovereignty israel claims over all of jerusalem as its capital 
this plea for understanding was conveyed to us officials in 
jerusalem and in washington 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said bushs 
letter expressed condolences about the violence between israelis 
and palestinians and told shamir it was important to all of us to 
have the focus back on iraq 
the 19 palestinians were slain after police used tear gas and 
rubber bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the stoning of 
jews praying at the western wall the attack on the jews was not 
condemned in the resolution 
israel felt it was being singled out unfairly its cabinet felt 
that not only was the resolution onesided but riots at holy 
places in other countries with a much higher death toll are 
routinely ignored by the united nations 
the administration urging israel to cooperate with the inquiry 
said it was the only way for the facts to be sorted out the 
israeli government has ordered its own investigation 
a us official insisting on anonymity said if shamir refused 
to cooperate the mood of the council will be less solicitous than 
if they did however he said no resolutions apart from the 
renewed request had been prepared for council action 
while israelis of various political persuasions may differ on 
most issues there is general unanimity that jerusalem must remain 
israels capital 
the predominantly arab eastern sector was under jordans rule 
for 19 years until israeli forces captured it during the 1967 
mideast war 
the cabinets decision and shamirs refusal to reverse it 
reflected concern that the united nations was trying to get a 
foothold in the city 
the united states and nearly all other nations do not recognize 
israeli sovereignty over east jerusalem 
bush has referred to it as occupied territory and the assertion 
contributed to the strains between the united states and israel 
the settlement of some soviet jewish refugees in east jerusalem 
the west bank and gaza is another sore point 
the bush administration considers settlements of soviet refugees 
or any other jews in the territories an obstacle to peace since the 
arabs hope to recapture the lands they lost in the 1967 war 
like its predecessors the administration also is committed to 
urging israel to give up most if not all of the territory in 
exchange for arab acceptance of the jewish state 
 
editors note barry schweid head of the aps state department 
staff has covered usisraeli relations since 1973

iraq is offering to swap canadian and german 
hostages for diplomatic visits from those countries in an effort to 
drive a wedge in the western alliance against baghdad say 
congressional sources 
the offers were made in recent days and represent cynical 
attempts to use hostages as bargaining chips secretary of state 
james a baker iii and defense secretary dick cheney told lawmakers 
wednesday in a closeddoor briefing the sources said 
iraqi president saddam hussein invited the foreign ministers of 
those two countries to visit his country holding out the prospect 
that some of their nationals could be released if they did so 
house members were told 
the two cabinet members said the overtures have failed but are 
signs that saddam would like to weaken western resolve by 
manipulating the hostages he holds said sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but the administration also described saddams military forces 
as deeply dug in along the border with saudi arabia and the 
defensive posture belies any shift toward a genuine openness to 
diplomatic solutions to the standoff said the sources 
my view is that from time to time saddam makes efforts 
designed purely to drive wedges between members of the coalition 
cheney told reporters after the briefing but if you look at his 
deplyments there is no indication he is preparing to withdraw 
rep mel levine dcalif said the reported entreaties to us 
allies are viewed by our guys as cynical exploitative of the 
hostages and i think congress agrees with that assessment 
he said baker described the situation as like that in a 
political cartoon showing saddam with bound hostages behind a sign 
that reads the bazaar is open 
the pessimism about any change in iraqs stance was underscored 
by sen richard lugar a senior member of the senate foreign 
relations committee who flatly predicted the fact is that were 
headed toward conflict 
were headed toward conflict because saddam hussein is 
reinforcing as far as we can see his forces in kuwait shows no 
sign whatsoever of giving up anything and the united nations is on 
a collision course to make sure he does give it up said lugar 
rind 
i think the possibility of armed conflict depends entirely 
upon our ability and willingness to bring it about he said 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis also 
said cheney told lawmakers there is no clear evidence that the 
iraqis have learned how to operate the hawk antiaircraft missiles 
they captured in kuwait 
aspin said baker and cheney had declined to discuss how they 
might consult with congress which is about to adjourn for the 
year if us military action is called for in the middle east 
if a decision is made to use military force in response to a 
provocation my guess is they will do that and consult 
afterwards aspin told reporters 
but if the international embargo does not succeed in driving 
saddam from kuwait in a reasonable time and bush decides to issue 
an ultimatum to iraq the procedure for consulting with congress 
has been left unclear he said 
house speaker thomas foley dwash and senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine said they would reserve the right to call 
congress back into session for such consultations and announced 
creation of a bipartisan 18member consultative group that would be 
available to consult with the president during the adjournment 
period

his campaign 
but a spokeswoman for gopac a political action committee for 
conservative us rep newt gingrich rgeorgia said the ads would 
continue likely right up to the nov 6 election

their own campaign messages they should be able to do that without 
outside influence

purchased about 25000 worth of advertising time for commercials 
for hermening the commercials are pseudobiography spots

irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh 
claims the cia and attorney general dick thornburgh abused secrecy 
procedures to frustrate the prosecution of a former cia agent 
the attorney general and the cia not only frustrated the 
public development of evidence against former cia agent joseph 
fernandez but did so in a manner that exasperated the district 
court and dragged out the resolution of this issue in unproductive 
litigation walsh charged wednesday in a report on the case 
walsh issued his report nearly two weeks after thornburgh 
effectively ended the prosecution by reaffirming his determination 
to block the release of secrets that the judge had already said 
fernandez was entitled to use in his defense 
the documents at issue showed the location of cia facilities in 
central america and detailing agency operations in costa rica the 
justice department quoted an administration official as saying 
release of such information would strike a devastating blow to 
national security 
thornburghs action marked the first time that an attorney 
generals use of a provision of the classified information 
procedures act had blocked a prosecution

congress should safeguard workers rights 
before employers begin widespread screening for genetic diseases 
says sen albert gore jr dtenn 
gore released a report wednesday by the office of technology 
assessment which showed that few us companies now require genetic 
testing of their employees and applicants but he said congress 
should move now before the practice becomes more widespread to 
head off discrimination against workers on the basis of genetic 
characteristics 
to a large extent there are few clear guidelines on how these 
tests can be used or how workers can be protected from having their 
rights violated said gore who requested the report 
genetic screening can help save lives by alerting an employer to 
a workers susceptibility to a particular occupational exposure 
the report noted 
but it expressed concern that employers might deny jobs to 
anyone whose tests show they are at risk of genetic disease and 
could prove a burden to a companys health insurance program 
genetic tests are available to detect sickle cell anemia cystic 
fibrosis huntingtons disease hemophilia duchenne muscular 
dystrophy and other diseases future tests could screen for such 
things as hypertension dyslexia alzheimers disease and cancer 
the report said

health activists say the citys newer 
cheaper giveaway condoms are too tight and so flimsy they split 
apart with the insertion of a couple of fingers 
if they break on your finger theres a real risk they could 
break elsewhere on your body said david fair former director of 
the city aids activities coordinating office 
fair and others expressed concern that poor people drug users 
and others who use the citys free condoms are getting inadequate 
protection from aids and other sexually transmitted diseases 
fair said wednesday that apparently the new brand crown was 
substituted when the price of the old brand prime went up from 5 
to 5 cents apiece 
gary henderson an assistant commissioner at the city 
procurement department would not say why the switch was made or 
whether the specifications were changed 
the health department referred questions to james hymes current 
director of the aids activities coordinating office hymes said he 
got no complaints after checking with 10 aids counselors who 
routinely demonstrate the toughness of condoms by putting their 
fist into them 
he said he was checking whether the crown condoms met 
specifications issued by the office until he hears conclusively 
he recommended they not be used 
the condoms are made by okamoto industries inc of tokyo 
hisayuki naito vice president for marketing of its american 
subsidiary okamoto usa in stratford conn said he had 
received no complaints 
he said the crown condom is roughly 1 millimeter smaller in 
diameter than the average brand and a little bit thin but the 
same strength as thicker brands he said a stanford university 
study rated the condoms as good 
as for the fit he said if you ask 100 people you can get 
100 different opinions 
the only people who would like these condoms are people who 
like pain fair said 
fran stoffa director of the aids task force said his private 
agency stopped distributing them theres a visible difference in 
the quality stoffa said theyre real thin it doesnt take a 
rocket scientist to see that 
to demonstrate he inserted his hand into the crown condom 
which split readily it should be able to withstand me putting a 
fist into them stoffa said 
however stoffa whose office has been distributing the crown 
condoms for about six weeks said not a whole lot of people 
complain about it its not the kind of thing where you demand your 
money back 
this years city budget prepared by fair called for the 
purchase of 1 million condoms with money set aside for agencies to 
buy another million the city controllers office said the city 
recently bought 625000 condoms at 51 cents apiece

a bill awaiting the presidents signature will 
compel colleges and universities to tell students how many major 
crimes are committed on campus 
it is time to take the mask off the idea that a college campus 
is a completely serene and protected environment said rep 
william goodling rpa a former teacher and principal who was the 
measures house sponsor 
the senate approved the measure by a voice vote wednesday 
sending it to president bush for his signature the bill passed the 
house monday night 
house and senate sponsors of the bill say they believe the 
president will sign it 
thestudent righttoknow and campus security act would 
require federallyaided colleges and universities to report campus 
crime statistics each year to students and employees covered 
crimes include murder rape robbery and auto theft 
information on violent crimes would have to be provided 
immediately and all crime data would be available to prospective 
students on request 
the measure was merged with another bill requiring institutions 
to release graduation rates of all students and students on sports 
scholarships schools would also have to make data available on 
athletic department revenues and expenditures and on racial 
composition of scholarship athletes 
sponsors included sens bill bradley dnj the former 
princeton university and new york knicks basketball star edward 
kennedy dmass and arlen specter rpa 
there is no comprehensive data on campus crime out of 3000 
colleges and universities and 5000 other federallyaided 
postsecondary schools only 352 provide crime statistics to the 
fbi 
surveys show that 80 percent of campus crimes are committed by 
one student upon another and that most of the violent crimes are 
alcohol or drugrelated according to congress 
goodling introduced the bill in september 1989 after being 
contacted by the parents of a 19yearold lehigh university student 
who was raped and murdered in her dormitory room in 1986 the 
assailant also a lehigh student had entered the dormitory through 
an emergency exit propped open by students visiting from another 
dorm

congressional negotiators face several key tax 
issues as they work on a compromise deficitreduction bill 
here are some of them according to a proposed compromise 
incorporating elements from both parties exact figures could 
change in the final agreement 
rates the 28 percent top income tax rate on the wealthiest 
600000 americans likely would be raised to 31 percent they would 
get a tax increase effective rates could even be higher depending 
on exemptions and deductions about 4 million couples and 
individuals who now pay a top rate of 33 percent would pay a 
maximum 31 percent and get a tax cut 
deductions a couple or individual could write off only 97 
percent of otherwise allowable itemized deductions on any portion 
of adjusted gross income exceeding 100000 thus a highincome 
taxpayer would lose 300 in deductions for each 10000 of income 
above 100000 this has the effect of raising the top marginal tax 
rate on those people to 32 percent 
exemptions benefits from the 2050 personal exemption allowed 
each taxpayer and dependent would be reduced as taxable income 
exceeds 100000 for single people and 150000 for childless 
couples filing a joint return the exemption would be fully lost 
once income tops 225000 for single individuals or 275000 for a 
couple filing jointly 
each exemption lost would raise the effective marginal tax rate 
by onehalf percentage point the bigger the family the higher 
their marginal rate thus a couple with two children would pay a 
top rate of 34 percent on part of their income the regular 31 
percent rate plus 1 percentage point because of the limit on 
deductions and 2 points by losing their exemptions 
capital gains the maximum tax rate on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of assets such as investments would be 28 
percent even though wages and other income would be taxed as high 
as 31 percent this would benefit those who pay a top 33 percent 
rate on income including capital gains under present law 
gasoline the 9centagallon tax would be increased by 5 or 6 
cents 
alcohol negotiators already have settled on higher taxes on 
alcoholic beverages tobacco airplane tickets furs and jewelry 
and expensive cars

a widely published writer on scientific topics 
says scientific american magazine wooed him then left him at the 
altar because he believes in the biblical account of creation 
forrest m mims iii alleged wednesday that an editor at the 
respected publication asked if hed like to take over its column 
about amateur experiments and rejected him after learning of his 
beliefs 
mims 46 of seguin tex insisted his own writing is unbiased 
and said he has never written about creationism 
ive wanted this opportunity for 20 years he said to 
have the opportunity and then lose it because of what i do on 
sunday is absolutely incredible 
scientific american publisher john moehling refused to address 
mims allegations in detail but said we dont discriminate in 
our pages among the people who work here or write for us the 
people who read us deserve to know that 
mims said that he has complained to two professional societies 
which said if i identified them they would drop the complaints 
mims has written in more than 60 publications including science 
digest the american journal of physics and national geographic 
world a sister publication of national geographic 
he said that in 1989 a scientific american editor expressed 
enthusiasm for his work and asked if hed like to become the 
magazines amateur scientist columnist 
he said he canceled practically all his writing assignments and 
was flown to new york where scientific american staffers 
congratulated him for getting the job 
but the editor who invited him there suddenly grew cold when 
mims mentioned hed written for christian magazines on such topics

cuba has expelled a mexican television crew 
in anger over a report by the network on a leading soviet 
newspapers criticism of cuban president fidel castro the 
television reported 
the action wednesday against reporters from a country with 
important links to cuba appeared to underscore cuban frustration at 
worsening ties with moscow which has cut aid to havana and is 
trying to force castro to embrace reforms 
they told us we were expelled from cuba and we had to leave 
today said televisa reporter jose eduardo campos during a live 
interview on a latenight edition of the private networks eco news 
progam 
campos said cuban officials expressed anger over an eco report 
from moscow quoting a critical report about castro and his brother 
in the soviet daily pravda he did not give a date or other details 
of the pravda article 
they explained to us that the work we had done in havana had 
been to their liking campos said but because of the moscow 
report the television eco was lying and that eco was not 
going to be received in havana 
anchorman jacobo zabludovsky said the report from moscow 
simply was limited to a textual translation of what was 
published in pravda the official soviet communist party 
newspaper 
castro a hardline communist has criticized soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs endorsemehnt of marketoriented reform 
massive soviet aid to cuba has been scaled back 
campos said he and camera crew members roberto ruvalcabo and 
guillermo gomez had arrived in havana on saturday and worked 
without any problem until they were summoned to the foreign 
ministry at midday wednesday 
ruvalcabo said officials told them that we were undesirable 
persons and that they used the word deported when the crew 
was loaded on a plane for mexico 
televisa operates four broadcast channels in mexico city alone 
with other channels elsewhere in mexico it also carries additional 
programs over cable eco broadcasts on one channel or another 24 
hours a day 
such action against a major progovernment mexican news outlet 
is surprising because mexico is one of cubas most important 
friends 
mexican officials for many years have resisted us attempts to 
isolate cuba in panamerican organizations and they have 
maintained air and sea links with the island nation

governments in the ivory coast and 
gabon will be tested on sunday in elections that reflect growing 
demands for multiparty democracy in subsaharan africa 
the ivory coasts octagenarian president felix houphouetboigny 
faces an opponent for the first time since independence from france 
in 1960 
in gabon president omar bongos democratic party with 22 
years of autocratic rule is being challenged by several 
opposition parties in the last round of voting for the national 
assembly 
the ruling parties are favored in both elections but their 
supporters concede that it no longer will be possible to shut 
opposition parties out of the system 
all but a handful of black africas nations were oneparty 
states at the beginning of the year when communist regimes started 
to fall in east europe gabons statecontrolled newspaper the 
union commented 
the great winds carrying democracy that have triumphed in 
the countries of eastern europe will not shake the coconut trees in 
africa 
within weeks one african country after another was hit by 
demonstrations demanding change 
as in eastern europe the collapse of economies was a major 
cause of africans dissatisfaction 
by now at least 13 governments have said they accept multiparty 
democracy in principle angola benin cameroon cape verde congo 
gabon guineabissau ivory coast mozambique sao tome and 
principe somalia zaire and zambia 
some governments including kenya sierra leone and the central 
african republic have refused to concede any rights to opposition 
groups equating criticism with treason 
although houphouetboigny gave in to demands to legalize 
opposition parties following riots in february his government has 
used every device at its command to block them 
opposition meetings were often banned or constrained by broad 
restrictions governmentcontrolled television and radio rarely 
mentioned the opposition except to accuse it of responsibility for 
damage caused during the riots 
the media nightly broadcast lengthy reports on meetings of 
people who supported the president 
after several demonstrations at the national television station 
the opposition was granted 20 minutes nightly of air time a 
concession made only two weeks before the voting one night the 
opposition broadcast was banned on grounds it contained lies 
one government restriction may have backfired initially it 
sought to encourage as many opposition groups to form as possible 
diluting their strength but only a week before the 10day 
presidential campaign was opened candidates were required to post 
the equivalent of an 80000 bond 
the bond would be forfeited if the candidate failed to gain at 
least 15 percent of the vote only one of the newly formed parties 
the ivorian popular front was able to meet the demand 
this reduced the election to a contest between houphouetboigny 
and front leader laurent gbagbo a 46yearold history professor 
who had been jailed for two years for opposing the president 
although no opinion polls have been conducted gbagbos party 
acknowledged it was having difficult building from its base of 
middleclass and educated ivorians it also lacked the staff of 
houphouetboignys ivorian democratic party whose control of the 
government for 30 years gives it broad leverage with the 
population 
the oppositions main campaign theme has been that 
houphouetboigny and his cronies have enriched themselves while the 
countrys once wealthy economy has been brought near collapse 
ivorian officials said first returns from voting will be 
released sunday night houphouetboigny 85 africas 
longestserving president received 100 percent of the vote in 
1985 according to the government 
the situation is more complicated in gabon also a former french 
colony where bongo still has three years to serve as president 
even the legalization of opposition parties failed to stop 
unrest this year and france was briefly forced to send in troops 
to evacuate europeans from the oil center of port gentil 
bongo may have won some breathing space with the sharp increase 
in oil prices after the iraqi invasion of kuwait the party of the 
president who claimed 98 percent of the vote in the last 
presidential election was winning 62 percent of the seats before 
the final round of voting sunday

manuel noriega looted panamas treasury tortured 
and killed opponents and ran drug and moneylaundering rackets his 
country charges in a 65 billion lawsuit against the fallen 
dictator 
for 10 years the thievery and thuggery that general noriega 
presided over damaged the people of panama said attorney gregory 
craig who filed the lawsuit in federal court wednesday on panamas 
behalf 
noriega who was driven from power by the us invasion of 
panama in 1989 is in jail in miami awaiting trial on charges of 
taking 46 million in bribes to protect drug trafficking he could 
get up 145 years in prison if convicted 
his lawyers accused panama of filing the lawsuit in a conspiracy 
with the united states to disrupt noriegas efforts to defend 
himself at the drug trial 
they have a total disrespect for the constitution of the 
united states defense attorney frank rubino said of panama 
and i believe they are doing this with the help of the united 
states 
the united states holds 20 million of noriegas money in frozen 
international bank accounts 6 million of which has been earmarked 
for noriegas defense attorneys but craig said panama would seek 
an injunction halting any release of the money 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said he did not believe the 
lawsuit would interfere with noriegas criminal trial scheduled to 
begin jan 28 but he acknowledged there could be a conflict 
between panama and noriegas lawyers over who gets the money 
as we have said in court several times the united states 
government is not the only government that has made claims on that 
money he said 
panamas lawsuit outlines noriegas alleged participation in 
assassination torture drug trafficking money laundering 
embezzlement detouring of funds illegal sale of visas and 
passports and abuse of authority 
the lawsuit estimates actual damages at 500 million which can 
be tripled under racketeering law an additional 5 billion is 
sought in punitive damages 
another of noriegas lawyers jon may said he had not read the 
entire lawsuit but that if it included allegations similar to the 
governments criminal case it is fiction 
eduardo vallarino panamas ambassador to the united states 
said his country is also preparing criminal charges against noriega 
but wont try to extradite him until after his us trial

the two scientists who say they achieved 
nuclear fusion at room temperature left others to defend their 
claim today in a key review of their work and chances for renewed 
funding 
the whereabouts of b stanley pns and martin fleischmann who 
work at the national cold fusion institute at the university of 
utah had been a mystery for days during which the institute 
couldnt reach them by either phone or fax machine 
late wednesday however pons requested a oneyear sabbatical in 
a fax transmission from his attorney university president chase 
peterson said the attorney said fleischmann was in england but he 
refused to disclose pons whereabouts 
the states ninemember fusion energy advisory council is 
reviewing the scientists disputed work and was scheduled to 
discuss renewed funding at the meeting today pons though not 
fleischmann had been scheduled to address the panel 
randy moon the states science adviser and a member of the 
council said the panels decision would be affected by whether 
pons appeared 
stan owes it to a lot of people to be able to report on his 
results moon said a lot of people at the university have been 
counting on pons to show the research is viable 
curtailing financing is a possibility he said the institute 
was founded in part with a 5 million state grant 
pons and fleischmann in march 1989 announced they had achieved a 
nuclear fusion reaction in a jar at room temperature many 
scientists have been unable to duplicate their work and have 
disputed their claim some have suggested it resulted from lab 
errors 
fusion is the process that powers the sun and hydrogen bombs 
fusing atoms rather than splitting them as nuclear reactors do 
the process which releases vast amounts of energy is generally 
thought to require temperatures of millions of degrees to get 
started pons and fleischmanns purported discovery of cold fusion 
held out the prospect of a cheap safe and practically 
inexhaustible source of energy 
despite their disappearances both scientists are committed 
more than ever to the university and the fusion work said c 
gary triggs an attorney for both scientists speaking from north 
carolina on wednesday 
he would not disclose pons whereabouts but said fleischmann had 
returned to his home in england for treatment of an undisclosed 
medical condition 
its nothing major but he has been undergoing treatment for a 
number of years and this is another treatment he said 
pons planned to return to the university in a week or so triggs 
said he said pons was requesting the sabbatical because he was 
faced with too many distractions while defending the cold fusion 
claims 
the only way that is ever going to happen is when they have 
the time to dedicate to the science he said stan and martin 
are scientists not politicians 
peterson said a decision on the request would be up to the 
chemistry department theres nothing wrong with a sabbatical and 
stan probably deserves it after all hes been through in the past 
year and a half he said 
the advisory council agenda included an update on the status of 
an independent scientific review of the two mens work and comments 
from university officials 
meanwhile the state auditors office has completed its audit of 
the institute state auditor tom allen said some recommendations 
have been made but he would not disclose them until the institute 
has responded 
we know pretty well where the moneys gone and what its being 
used for said council chairman raymond hixson the only real 
problem we have is the fact that dr pons and dr fleischmann are 
so reluctant to reveal their data what theyve been doing and how 
theyre doing it 
there will be a gap without pons and fleischmann there that 
well have to fill in later hixson said 
pons departure didnt surprise him he said 
i can understand why he might want to disappear for a while i 
just wish hed told me about it hixson said but i dont think 
we need to worry about it

an army newspaper marking the 30th anniversary of 
a rocket explosion says the mishap killed 165 people including a 
leading general making it the worst known spacerelated accident 
in the soviet union 
the red star article on wednesday said a prototype rockets 
second stage was accidentally ignited on the launch pad causing an 
explosion that burned many of the victims beyond recognition 
secrecy has shrouded the accident at the baikonur space center 
ever since the explosion shot flames into the central asian sky on 
oct 24 1960 no official death toll or technical details of the 
accident have ever been released despite several articles 
describing the event 
a monument to the victims lists only 54 names and published 
obituaries claimed that field marshall mitrofan nedelin commander 
in chief of the strategic rocket forces died in an unrelated plane 
crash 
red star reported on the accidents 30th anniversary wednesday 
saying the tragedy at the cosmodrome caused the deaths of 165 
people 
james oberg an american expert on the soviet space program 
said western observers estimated the death toll to be as high as 
300 he said in an interview from his houston home that many 
victims were immediately shipped back to moscow for burial 
the newspaper said the rocket was a new design and oberg said 
he believes it was a new type of missile he said space officials 
told him the explosion came after the first stage failed to ignite 
and technicians tried to replace one component 
somebody plugged an umbilical cord into the wrong 
connection igniting the second stage oberg said the flames 
caused fuel trucks to burst into fire unleashing fireballs 
people in the vicinity just burst into flames like 
candlewax he said 
the red star account said the explosion was caused by an 
unnecessary sequence of events in carrying out one of the 
operations while the valves of the second stage were opened 
starting the engine 
oberg hearing the russianlanguage version said it did not 
offer a clear technical explanation of the accident 
the newspaper said the rockets launch was repeatedly delayed 
for technical reasons including leaking fuel 
it quotes stanislav pavlov then chief of the launching group 
as saying a few drops of fuel burned holes in technicians rubber 
gloves when the rockets joints and tubes were checked for leaks 
we didnt pay attention to this but later we learned it was 
dangerous he was quoted as saying 
pavlov said he was standing 15 to 20 yards from the rocket when 
it exploded 
the site was on fire and full of smoke he told the 
newspaper the first thought that came to my mind was thats it 
the end 
pavlov said he rushed to a nearby bunker housing the control 
center but was still so badly burned he spent three days 
unconscious and one year in the hospital recovering 
he said his injury was not entered on his official record until 
1988 
pavlov said he was told nedelin survived the explosion bt died 
later in the hospital from his burns he said many of the other 
victims were so badly burned they could not be identified visually

venus has 600milewide circular bulges 
on its surface caused by molten rock pressing up from inside the 
planet the same kind of forces that created hawaii a magellan 
scientist says 
the bulges are as much as a mile high said ellen stofan a 
geologist who analyzes the spacecrafts pictures of venus at nasas 
jet propulsion laboratory 
you have hot material that rises from deep within the interior 
of the planet pushing up overlying rock she said the process 
happens over scales of hundreds of millions of years she said 
wednesday 
from a birdseyeview the bulges look like sets of concentric 
rings the rings on the bulges are ridges and valleys numerous 
volcanoes and lava flows dot the bulges which are called coronas 
stofan said the bulges are formed by the same kind of upwelling 
of molten rock that created the hawaiian islands 
on wednesday magellan orbited venus for the 551st time since 
arriving at the planet aug 10 
it has used its picturemaking radar to peer through venus 
thick clouds during 288 of those orbits since mapping started sept 
15 magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis in may 1989 
about 30 of the coronas were found on venus by the soviet venera 
15 and 16 orbiters in 1983 and 1984 but the venera spacecraft 
couldnt determine if they were bulges or depressions caused by 
gargantuan meteorites 
magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated radar 
that makes much more detailed pictures and can also calculate 
surface topography

humphrey the humpback whale with either 
wanderlust or an outofwhack compass swam under the golden gate 
bridge and out to sea after his latest visit to the city by the 
bay 
accompanied by a flotilla of boats the 40foot 45ton whale 
cruised into the pacific late wednesday afternoon bringing cheers 
from his human escorts 
he looks happy like this is where he belongs said coast 
guard seaman walter mccrea 
humphrey drawn for some unknown reason to san francisco bay 
tends to overdo his meanderings in 1985 when the media named him 
humphrey he took a 25day tour of the areas inland waters he has 
come back every year since 
on sunday humphrey returned to the bay and took several more 
wrong turns before he wandered into shallow water and spent a day 
stuck on a mud flat after being freed tuesday humphrey swam 
toward the ocean 
whale scientists have no idea why he goes off course 
my guess is somethings wrong with this guy said brian 
gibeson a marine biologist at the california academy of sciences 
it could be that a parasite has affected his brain or inner ear 
making humphrey like a car with his wheels out of alignment 
most whales stay about 20 miles outside the golden gate but 
some like to feed in shallower waters said denize springer of the 
marine mammal center in marin county its not unusual for whales 
to come into the bay but they usually just take a bite and 
leave 
marine biologists feared humphrey might die while stuck in the 
shallows near candlestick park 
a coast guard boat tugged humphrey with a line as wading people 
pushed and nudged him until the whale was able to get loose at high 
tide a crowd on shore cheered

congressional negotiators reached a 
lastminute agreement on allowing hundreds of thousands of more 
immigrants into the country particularly those with new job 
skills 
the last hurdles to the legislation were removed wednesday night 
when house and senate sponsors of competing bills agreed to 
establish special visas for foreign investors who start businesses 
in depressed rural and urban areas and to provide a temporary legal 
haven for salvadorans fleeing violence 
the bargainers agreed to split the difference between the two 
bills on just how much to raise the current quotas 
its a good blend said sen alan simpson rwyo who had 
threatened to block passage if more emphasis wasnt put on 
screening applicants more for criminal records and needed skills 
and deporting illegal immigrants 
he predicted the senate would pass the legislation today or 
friday aides to house sponsors of the measure said the house would 
pass it before congress adjourns this weekend 
current law allows some 490000 foreigners to immigrate to the 
united states each year but requires that 90 percent of them have 
close relatives here who already have established us citizenship 
only 54000 socalled classic immigrants seeking job 
opportunities but with no relatives can be let in annually 
under the compromise the total cap would rise to 700000 
immigrants a year from 1992 through 1994 and fall back to 675000 
from 1995 on the existing preferences for immigrants with needed 
professional job or educational skills would increase to 140000 
but the agreement also raises the influx of immigrants allowed 
strictly to reunite families from 436000 a year now to 505000 
annually over the next three years falling to 480000 in 1995 
the united states had few formal immigration policies until the 
1920s when countrybycountry quotas were first established those 
quotas were changed in 1965 to shift the emphasis to keeping 
immigrant families together 
rep bruce morrison dconn a key author of the house bill and 
the compromise called the new legislation the most comprehensive 
immigration package in the nations history in that it addresses 
both economic and humanitarian concerns 
it includes language to provide temporary protection to 
salvadorans who fear bloodshed in their homeland while 
strengthening provisions to exclude criminal and terrorists 
morrison said 
simpson had vehemently objected to provisions by rep joseph 
moakley dmass in the house bill that would have granted 
threeyear stays of deportation of illegal salvadoran lebanese 
liberian and kuwaiti immigrants 
under the compromise those people would have 18month windows 
to establish legal status 
the accord also includes simpsons demand for 10000 special 
visas for foreign investors who as immigrants establish 
businesses in depressed rural and urban areas that hire at least 10 
american workers 
in addition it establishes 40000 special visas for immigrants 
from europe with distant relatives in the united states who have 
been adversely affected by the current policy emphasizing 
reunification of spouses and children with their parents

the three principal moslem and christian 
militias in lebanon agreed today to withdraw from beirut and its 
suburbs in line with the governments plan to end the 15yearold 
civil war 
president elias hrawis government obtained agreement from samir 
geageas rightwing christian lebanese forces militia nabih 
berris moderate shiite amal militia and druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party 
the pullout area covers what is known as greater beirut 
the moslem and christian sectors of a capital divided since the 
outbreak of the civil war in 1975 as well as its immediate 
suburbs 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the zero hour for launching the greater beirut plan would most 
probably be set before early next week 
hrawis syrianbacked government announced after a threehour 
meeting wednesday its decision to spread state authority over 
the area but set no deadline for carrying out the plan to create a 
militiafree capital 
the proiranian hezbollah the fundamentalist shiite moslem 
umbrella organization for groups holding us and other foreign 
hostages today said only that it will announce its decision after 
holding talks 
it did not elaborate 
on wednesday police said hezbollah or party of god handed 
over some beirut positions to government troops but maintained its 
stronghold in the south beirut slums of bir abed hay madi and 
moawad 
agriculture minister mohsen dalloul and defense minister albert 
mansour assigned by the government to follow up the greater beirut 
plan with militia leaders were to put the final touches to the 
mechanism of the militias withdrawal the governmenmt source 
said 
he said the army command of gen emile lahoud has prepared two 
brigades to fill in the vacuum resulting from the militias 
withdrawal 
the greater beirut plan was announced 11 days after lebanese and 
syrian forces crushed rebel gen michel aouns 11month mutiny in 
an eighthour assault on his tiny enclave in the christian 
heartland northeast of beirut 
the oct 13 assault which left 550 people dead and 1200 
wounded forced aoun to seek refuge in the french embassy 
france has granted aoun asylum but lebanon has refused to allow 
him to leave along with his main military aides insisting they 
should face a court of law for a variety of charges including the 
alleged theft of state funds 
aoun had rejected an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end the 
civil war saying it set no timetable for the withdrawal of an 
estimated 40000 syrian troops supporting the government 
the greater beirut plan was conceived in line with the peace 
plan which also envisages the disbanding of all the warring 
militias throughout the nation 
the government source said the first step in implementing the 
peace plan after crushing aouns mutiny would be achieving the 
greater beirut 
disbanding the militias is not an easy step at present they 
should withdraw to their respective areas of influence far from the 
capital the source said without further elaboration 
the peace pact which was ratified by parliament on aug 22 
1989 distributes power equally between moslems and christians 
effectively shifting some power to the moslem majority 
the agreement however maintains the presidency for the 
maronite catholics the largest christian sect the maronites have 
dominated lebanon since independence from france in 1943 
hezbollah is believed the umbrella group for kidnappers of 13 
westerners including six americans the longestheld is terry

ten bucks can bring you closer to specters 
of spanish settlers southwest pioneers and gamblers said to stalk 
the narrow winding streets of this centuriesold city just 
remember to tie your shoelaces tight 
margaret noblin insisted a few of the folks who have taken the 
ghost tour she operates in santa fe have had haunting experiences 
but she doesnt guarantee supernatural appearances 
what she does promise for a 10 ticket is at least 90 minutes 
of entertaining tales mixing local legends regional folklore and 
haunting history the stories are delivered at a dozen stops on the 
walking tour 
i have to say i havent ever seen a ghost noblin said 
but ive had the hair stand up on my arms in different locations 
weve had people say they definitely feel a presence 
santa fes ghosts tend to be playful noblin said the shoelaces 
of a tour participant became mysteriously untied at the same 
location twice within a month said noblin who was there for one 
of the eerie unravelings 
that same night everybody on the tour smelled a scent but 
nobody had on that cologne she said 
on a recent night there were no spirits in evidence as a small 
group of visitors made the spooky trek 
wheres the ghost demanded 5yearold carissa rhea 
visiting from houston with her mother vanya she was disappointed 
when a stop at a hotel failed to rouse one of santa fes most 
notorious ghosts that of julia staab 
mrs stabb the wife of a wealthy 19thcentury merchant is said 
to still inhabit the victorian house now a hotel a few blocks 
from the plaza where she once presided over large parties 
julias portrait hangs above a marble fireplace in a firstfloor 
sitting room the darkhaired beauty wears a look of serenity that 
belies the antics with which her ghost is credited 
julias ghost is said to have flung glassware upended the trays 
of hapless waiters and thrown a major fit when construction 
workers tried to move the fireplace tour guide betsy sollitt said 
guests who rented julias former bedroom were reportedly driven 
out in the middle of the night by incessant and unexplained toilet 
flushing according to the guide who uses the name mariah at work 
she told of la llorona a legendary mother said to have drowned 
her children who now wanders the arroyos wailing her grief at 
night 
blending history and fable with a theatrical flourish the guide 
also threw in an occasional downtoearth tip for tourists 
they have a good thai special here she said of one 
restaurant where the tour stopped to learn about an exorcism held

residents are fighting plans to build a 
supermarket near the homestead of samuel wilson the army meat 
inspector during the war of 1812 whose name legend has it gave 
rise to the term uncle sam for the united states 
opponents of a planned 8 million supermarket near the remains 
of wilsons home claim the store would spoil the historic site and 
destroy the only wilderness park in one of the nations oldest 
industrial centers 
the four acres the city wants to sell are a wooded area unique 
in troy a city about 10 miles north of albany on the hudson river 
that was a pioneer in the us steel industry 
theres a lot of people who grew up near there who use the 
park as a relief from the city a place where nature rules instead 
of man jim lewis who organized a protest against the 
supermarket in august said wednesday 
state and federal officials last week rejected troys plan to 
sell the land to hannaford bros of maine which wants to build a 
super shop n save there 
city officials and hannaford are still seeking approval of the 
sale 
hannaford already owns four nearby acres that include the 
foundation for wilsons home supermarket spokesman stephen culver 
said hannaford cannot build without the citys four acres 
wilson was an inspector who stamped the initials us on 
barrels of salted meat legend has it troops claimed that stood for 
uncle sam and the name caught on as a symbol of the army and then 
as a national nickname to counter that of englands john bull 
the state parks recreation and historic preservation office 
denied the sale because of the visual and environmental impact the 
supermarket would have on the park said gus thompson deputy parks 
commissioner the state will reconsider if the city and hannaford 
revise construction plans he said 
the supermarket would be built next to the uncle sam house and 
hannaford has promised to spend 100000 to beautify the historic 
site about 30 acres of parkland would remain next to the 
supermarket 
but architect doug bucher said a huge retaining wall for the 
supermarket would hunker alongside the uncle sam site 
as an architect involved in visual sorts of things visually 
what that supermarket is going to do to that area is outrageous 
he said 
of the harm to the uncle sam site he said it depends on how 
historically significant you consider uncle sam he was a real 
character who has taken on a lot of meaning over the years

berthold lubetkin an architect who played a 
leading role in founding the modernist school in britain in the 
1930s has died at age 88 his family said 
lubetkin died tuesday at bristol in western england the family 
said wednesday no cause of death was given 
the son of an industrialist he was born in tblisi in what is 
now the soviet republic of georgia 
he was reticent about his early years saying there is no such 
thing as a fact but news reports said he was educated in moscow 
and st petersburg now leningrad witnessed the bolshevik 
revolution of 1917 and absorbed the progressive ideas of 
constructivism prevalent at that time 
in 1922 he accompanied an exhibition of soviet art to berlin 
and went on to pursue architectural and engineering studies at 
various european centers 
in 1925 he went to paris then the focus of the european 
avantgarde movement and acted as site supervisory architect for 
konstantin melnikovs dynamic constructivist soviet pavilion for 
the paris exhibition of decorative arts of that year 
in the french capital he met among others the russianborn 
writer ilya ehrenburg and the painters georges braque fernand 
leger and pablo picasso and worked with jean ginsberg with whom he 
designed an apartment block in the avenue de versailles 
by then a glamorous and exotic figure lubetkin came to london 
in 1931 and the following year set up tecton a cooperative of 
young architects committed to radical ideas 
modernism was named after the modern architecture research group 
which lubetkin helped found in 1933 but lubetkins first buildings 
in britain were designed not for people but animals 
in 1932 thanks to the influence of scientists sir solly 
zuckerman later lord zuckerman ad sir julian huxley brother of 
writer aldous huxley he was commissioned to design the gorilla 
house at london zoo and in 1937 the penguin pool 
the famous pools composition of curved planes of reinforced 
concrete still draws acclaim from students of architecture 
his first opportunity to build for humans came in 1933 when he 
was commissioned to design a luxury apartment block at highgate in 
north london the capitals highest point 
highpoint one as the block was called was the most conspicuous 
statement of the socalled new white architecture in britain 
many of its details like the scurved front to the balconies went 
on to become cliches in the 1950s 
lubetkins london monument to vladimir i lenin unveiled by the 
soviet ambassador in 1942 was later removed because of repeated 
attacks by anticommunists 
after world war ii the architect concentrated on designing 
homes for bluecollar workers 
tecton broke up in 1948 and lubetkin abandoned architecture to 
take up farming in gloucestershire in western england 
an often impatient man and an inveterate gambler lubetkin 
radiated cosmopolitan charm and had an engagingly mischievous sense 
of humor but he was unable to conceal his anger at the direction 
taken by postwar architecture 
in 1982 in belated recognition of his pioneering work the 
royal institute of british architects presented him with its royal 
gold medal for architecture 
in his acceptance speech he attacked the architectural style 
known as postmodernism that flourished after the war as a 
transvestite aberration the mumbo jumbo of a hitandmiss 
society 
he was equally critical of the style dubbed hightech 
lubetkin married architect margaret church in 1936 she died in 
1978 they had two daughters and a son who survive him

more than 250 christian fundamentalists seeking to 
emigrate to the united states have been stranded at moscows 
international airport for four days unable to leave or return to 
their homes 
members of the stranded group said on thursday they obtained 
what they thought were the necessary documents to leave the 
country a soviet exit visa and a us entry permit 
however they said soviet officials were demanding that they 
also obtain an israeli stamp in their visas since that is the only 
country that allows open immigration from the soviet union 
this is hard to understand since the group was scheduled to 
fly to the united states and take up residence there said andrew 
levdonsky one of the stranded fundamentalists 
the group of 259 fundamentalists mostly pentecostals passed 
through customs checks at moscows sheremetevo airport but was 
stopped at passport control 
since monday the group including dozens of children has 
camped out on benches and on the floor making do with basic 
foodstuffs such as bread and milk supplied by the us embassy 
we are stuck here this is like a jail said pavel zolnikov 
some of the time they dont even allow us to use the bathroom 
levdonsky said us embassy officials were trying to get proper 
documents for them 
another fundamentalist ivan tanasov said soviet officials told 
them that although they were going to the united states an israeli 
stamp was necesary because that was the only country now accepting 
soviet emigres without specific invitations from relatives 
all of us have sold our belongings we have given up our 
homes we have no place to go levdonsky said 
the fundamentalists had to give up their passports and 
citizenship when they were issued soviet exit visas group members 
said 
tanasov said two groups of christian fundamentalists left the 
soviet union last week with no problems and no israeli stamps he 
feared that others who want to emigrate will find themselves 
stranded like himself

congress appears poised to repeal strict 
antiobscenity curbs on the national endowment for the arts and 
leave allegations of federal obscene art subsidies for the 
courts to decide 
the senate dealt a defeat to the endowments conservative foes 
wednesday night when it rejected 7029 a tough new obscenity ban 
proposed by sen jesse helms rnc 
instead the senate voted 7324 to require the nea to get its 
money back from grant recipients who are later convicted of 
violating obscenity or child pornography laws guilty artists would 
be barred from receiving new nea grants for three years 
the house approved a similar measure last week the senates 
action virtually assured that the same solution to the obscene 
art controversy will survive when negotiators from both chambers 
draft a compromise later his week for final congressional 
approval 
both the house and senate have rejected extremism in favor of 
a reasoned thoughtful approach said rep pat williams dmont 
architect of the house compromise 
undaunted helms served notice that he hadnt abandoned the 
fight 
assuming he defeats democratic challenger harvey gantt and 
returns to the senate next year helms said i say to the arts 
community and the homosexuals who are upset about this amendment 
you aint seen nothin yet 
the nea proposal was contained in an 117 billion 
appropriations bill that the senate approved wednesday night for 
the interior department and several other federal agencies for the 
fiscal year that began oct 1 
under the senate bill the arts agency would get a oneyear 
extension of life and a 170 million budget through next september 
that is 5 million less than president bush requested and 10 
million less than the house approved 
the endowments statutory authority technically expired oct 1 
williams predicted that the new congress convening in january will 
quickly approve a threeyear extension of the neas life 
apart from differences in the neas proposed budget the senate 
bill would allow endowment chairman john e frohnmayer to continue 
requiring grant recipients to sign a nonobscenity pledge the 
house voted to outlaw the pledge which has prompted three federal 
lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
the senate rejected helms proposal to forbid nea support for 
works that depict or describe in a patently offensive way 
sexual or excretory activities or organs 
later on voice votes the senate rejected another helms 
amendment intended to bar nea grants for affluent artists but it 
approved a separate helms proposal to ban federal support for any 
work that denigrates religious objects or beliefs 
the senate bill as approved would scrap a yearold ban on nea 
support for works that may be considered obscene including 
depictions of homosexual or sadomasochistic activites sexual 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
the judicial formula for settling obscene art disputes was 
proposed by sen orrin hatch rutah leader of a bipartisan 
coalition of liberals and conservatives that included sens 
claiborne pell dri edward m kennedy dmass and nancy l 
kassebaum rkan 
hatch said their compromise was aimed at protecting taxpayer 
funds and artists freedom of expression at the same time 
but helms charged that the senate was ducking its 
responsibility if it relied on the courts to halt the flow of 
obscene art 
were not talking about violins or symphony orchestras or 
choral groups he told his colleagues were talking about 
these sleazeballs who have been getting money from the national 
endowment for the arts under the pretext of having produced 
something they call art 
its a farce helms said its worse than a farce its a 
fraud on the taxpayers of america 
the senate version of the interior appropriations bill totaling 
117 billion and including the nea compromise was approved on a 
926 roll call and sent to a conference committee with the house 
for reconciliation of differences

chinas legislature proposed today that the death 
penalty be imposed for activities related to pornography and drug 
smuggling 
the proposal comes as china conducts a major anticrime campaign 
that already has resulted in hundreds of executions for a wide 
range of crimes 
china also announced a new antipornography campaign this week 
after destroying 32 million publications in a similar drive last 
year 
separate draft laws on pornography and drug abuse were submitted 
to the national peoples congress standing committee which meets 
between annual meetings of the 2970member full congress the 
standing committee has about 155 members 
the official xinhua news agency said that under one draft law 
people who use pornographic materials to carry out criminal 
activities might face the death penalty it did not explain 
exactly what activities were covered and later specified that 
producers and sellers of pornography faced at most life 
imprisonment 
those who spread pornographic materials to primary and middle 
school students must be punished severely xinhua quoted the draft 
as saying 
it defined pornography as material that describes sexual 
behavior in detail or presents obscene scenes 
the draft said scientific works and works with artistic value 
were not included a decade ago china considered even scientific 
discussions of sexual relations to be pornographic 
the second draft law set forth punishments for producing 
smuggling and selling illegal drugs xinhua said it said the draft 
called for the death penalty in some cases but gave no specifics 
illegal drugs and pornography have increased in china over the 
past decade after being nearly eradicated but neither is nearly as 
widespread as in most developed countries 
chinas aging leaders however are determined to wipe out what 
they consider signs of western contagion and weakened social 
control both potential threats to communist party rule 
in announcing the new antipornography campaign officials said 
pornography was the inevitable result of capitalism and 
westernstyle democracy 
china already imposes the death penalty for a wide range of 
crimes and some sellers of pornographic materials and drugs have 
been executed judges have wide latitude in sentencing 
however executions for drug and pornographyrelated activities 
are likely to increase if laws are passed specifically recommending 
it 
the drafts must be approved by the standing committee and the 
full congress which meets in the spring drafts sometimes are 
worked on for years before being voted on 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group 
counted more than 650 death sentences reported in the official 
media from january to midaugust most came after china launched 
its anticrime campaign in late may 
most death sentences are carried out immediately after 
sentencing with a bullet to the back of the head 
from late august to early october official newspapers reported 
114 more death sentences for crimes ranging from murder to stealing 
public electrical equipment in addition executions are often 
carried out without being reported 
amnesty international said this years executions are the most 
since 1983 when china launched another anticrime campaign

a federal appeals court has ordered an art dealer 
to return four sixthcentury byzantine mosaics stripped from a 
cyprus church after turkeys 1974 invasion of the mediterranean 
island 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals on wednesday upheld an 
indiana courts august 1989 ruling ordering dealer peg goldberg of 
the indianapolis suburb of carmel to return the valuable religious 
artwork to cyprus 
i think it sends a powerful message in indiana you cannot 
take title to something from a thief you cant just go buy this 
stuff and expect to keep it said john david hoover an 
indianapolis attorney for the republic of cyprus 
art experts viewed the case as a landmark in a growing effort by 
lessdeveloped nations to reclaim and protect national treasures 
the pieces were chiseled from the ceiling of a church in northern 
cyprus an area controlled by a turkishbacked government 
recognized only by turkey 
ms goldberg bought the mosaics from a turk living in munich 
germany for 108 million in july 1988 religious leaders and 
cypriot officials claimed the mosaics were stolen and sued ms 
goldberg for their return 
ms goldbergs attorney joe c emerson would not comment on 
the courts decision wednesday he said he did not know whether the 
art dealer would appeal 
ms goldberg who had argued that she attempted to make sure the 
works were not stolen when she bought them did not return a call 
after messages were left on her answering machine 
chief judge william bauer writing for the court said the 
turkish governments seizure of property in cyprus did not 
invalidate the autocephalous greekorthodox church of cypress 
claims of ownership 
the mosaics pieced together with painted glass about 525 ad 
are fragments of a much larger work on the ceiling of a small stone 
church in northern cyprus the pieces roughly 2 feet square 
depict jesus as a boy the apostles james and matthew and an 
archangel 
they are among only a handful of icons surviving the first few 
centuries of christianity 
various appraisals place the mosaics value between 4 million 
and 6 million hoover said they are being stored in a private 
vault in indianapolis 
the lawsuit was filed after ms goldberg tried to sell the 
mosaics to the j paul getty museum in malibu calif for 20 
million marion true the getty museums curator of antiques 
turned down the offer and contacted authorities in cyprus 
the court ruled that ms goldberg did not check sufficiently 
into the legal ownership of the mosaics before buying them hoover 
said 
ms goldberg testified she contacted customs officials in the 
united states germany switzerland and turkey as well as the 
international foundation for art research asking if the mosaics 
were stolen 
bauer called her efforts a few lastminute phone calls 
joining bauer in his opinion was judge wilbur pell judge 
richard cudahay issued a concurring opinion

wages salaries and other benefits paid to 
american workers rose 52 percent in the 12 months ending in 
september the government reported today 
the labor department said its employment cost index considered 
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures was pushed 
ahead to a large degree by a sharp 68 percent rise in benefit 
costs for private industry workers 
the government blamed much of the past years steep increase on 
the rising cost of health insurance nonproduction bonuses 
workers compensation insurance and a rise this year in the social 
security tax rate also contributed to the rapid spurt in benefit 
costs the labor department said 
a year ago benefit costs had jumped 60 percent for the 
12month period ending in september 1989 
wages and salaries for private industry workers climbed 42 
percent the report said just under the 43 percent increase 
recorded a year ago 
the 52 percent increase in all compensation costs for both 
private sector and government workers was just above the 51 
percent gain of a year ago the government said 
todays report was sure to add to analysts concerns over the 
inflation threat facing the nation and its impact on americas 
already struggling economy 
last week the government reported that consumer prices surged 
08 percent in september the second steep inflation rise brought 
on by soaring energy prices that followed iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
that inflation report showed that for the first nine months of 
the year consumer prices have advanced at an annual rate of 66 
percent well above the increase for all of 1989 of 46 percent 
eventually analysts expect the inflation brought on by higher 
oil prices to start showing up in wages and salaries as well 
because workers will start demanding more compensation to make up 
for the drain on their wallets 
todays report showed that overtheyear pay gains were about 
the same in the serviceproducing industries where wages rose 42 
percent as in the goodsproducing industries where wages rose 41 
percent 
within the serviceproducing industries wage and salary 
increases ranged from 26 percent in wholesale trade to 62 percent 
in hospitals and the insurance industry pay gains among the 
goodsproducing industries ranged from 24 percent in construction 
to 46 percent in durablegoods manufacturing 
nonunion workers received better wage gains than their union 
counterparts continuing a trend thats been ongoing since 198384 
the government said nonunion workers pay rose 44 percent while 
union workers saw gains of 36 percent 
for state and local government workers the 53 percent pay 
gains for the year ending in september 1990 were lower than the 55

schools todays report said 
the 52 percent increase in the employment cost index for all 
workers including those in the government over the 12 months 
ending in september was under the 54 percent rise in the 12 months 
ending in june

western europes arms industry its 
orders dwindling in the postcold war era could shrink by nearly a 
third by the mid1990s the stockholm international peace research 
institute said today 
armsmanufacturing companies will be faced with a shrinking 
pie and there is no alternative to reducing existing over 
capacities the prestigious institute said in a report 
the institute predicted that within five years up to 500000 of 
the european industrys 14 million jobs would disappear and arms 
sales will be reduced as much as 30 percent 
the report says the industry is reacting to talks in vienna 
austria on reducing conventional forces in europe the planned 
soviet pullout from eastern europe and the collapse of the warsaw 
pact 
the 71page document was written by armscontrol experts ian 
anthony of great britain anges courades allebeck of france and 
herbert wulf of germany 
it said the persian gulf crisis has provided no new markets and 
orders from developing nations have fallen because they lack hard 
currency to buy expensive modern weaponry 
such big customers as egypt israel and syria are reducing arms 
imports and iraq and kuwait are under an arms embargo 
paradoxically there will likely be a decrease of arms imports 
in the gulf area anthony said adding that it was unlikely 
imports to saudi arabia would rise enough for any substantial 
effect on the arms industry 
one reason he said was that western nations were unlikely to 
support major exports to saudi arabia because of the volatility of 
the middle east 
european nato countries bought new weapons worth 324 billion 
last year during the same period the united states bought arms 
for 718 billion 
the report says 70 percent of the 100 largest european arms 
producers are in great britain germany and france 
the european arms industry grew for years until military budgets 
leveled off in the mid1980s in the years ahead annual military 
budget cuts of at least 2 percent can be expected the institute 
said 
european arms companies started cutting down three years ago and 
some 100000 jobs have been lost already the report says 
the industry is restructuring itself through mergers and 
diversification into civilian production civilian companies are 
being acquired as in british aerospaces purchase of automaker 
rover 
the report lists more than 20 takeovers and eight mergers since 
the beginning of 1989 many deals have been across borders 
including the creation of a french and italian space company 
matra marconi espace 
the institute said companies that generate most of their incomes 
from the arms sector will be heavily affected by the reductions 
but not all sectors of the arms industry will suffer 
the report says western europes future defense is likely to be 
based on fewer men and fewer massive tank and artillery units 
armed forces would consist of smaller highly mobile units equipped 
with hightech weaponry 
arms companies specializing in electronics helicopter 
production and military aircraft appear to have good future 
prospects in addition production of missiles not included in 
armsreduction talks may grow

coal miners trying to organize the 
first mass independent workers union in the soviet union said today 
they had no interest in belonging to a reorganized government trade 
union 
the national congress of trade unions the governmentsponsored 
organization representing 140 million workers voted wednesday in 
moscow to dissolve and reconstitute itself as a voluntary 
association of unions 
but the coal miners were not impressed 
its not a resignation said viktor perebanos cochairman 
of the workers committee in the kuzbass coal region of siberia 
its a kind of a curtain for the government to influence 
through lower organizations the trade unions of the people he 
said at a miners congress in the ukrainian city of donetsk 
delegates representing 2 million miners from throughout the 
country were voting today on a draft principle for forming an 
independent federation of workers the miners have shunned state 
unions as unresponsive to their needs 
coal minister mikhail i shchadov was scheduled to address them 
he was shouted down and driven from the hall when he spoke to a 
similar miners congress during the summer 
the moscow congress attended by 2500 delegates was moved 
forward by two years apparently to coincide with the miners 
meeting in the donetsk coal basin 600 miles south of the soviet 
capital 
its vote to dissolve appeared an effort to counteract the 
emergence of a radical miners union that could repeat the 
nationwide strike that threatened to cripple the nation in july 
1989 
president mikhail s gorbachev in a speech to the 
governmentbacked group said he favored strong and independent 
unions that would act constructively and responsibly during the 
transition to a market economy the official news agency tass 
reported 
miners in donetsk complained the ministry of the coal industry 
which owns all mines and associated industries was trying to 
dilute their organization by underwriting the meeting and excluding 
radicals 
alexander adanidi a member of kuznetsk basin workers 
committee which started the 1989 strike said the ministry tried 
to undermine the legitimacy of the congress by contributing 67000 
to sponsor it 
however miners from western siberia kazakhstan and the far 
north said they would go ahead with plans for an independent union 
they said they would defer a strike pending resolution of their 
complaints by the legislature of the soviet unions largest 
republic russia the republics legislature now is session in 
moscow 
miners from the kuznetsk basin in western siberia considered 
among the most radical participants in the donetsk said they 
already had drawn up a draft charter for an independent miners 
union 
the siberian union plan envisions a network of independent 
unions in various soviet republics independent of the government 
the miners strikes of 1989 began in protest of working and 
living conditions and shortages of such basics consumer goods 
demands quickly escalated to include regional economic autonomy for 
the main mine regions 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov persuaded the miners to return 
to work promising to meet most of their demands but most of the 
promises remain unfulfilled an issue that has spurred new strikes

contracts settled so far this year through 
collective bargaining gave workers average annual wage increases of 
33 percent over the life of the pacts the government said today 
the last time parties covered by those settlements negotiated 
usually in 1987 or 1988 wage gains were smaller averaging just 
21 percent annually over the contract term the labor department 
said 
most of the gains reflected pay gains that were larger than 
those in previous contracts particularly for workers in petroleum 
refining food stores parcel delivery and health services the 
report said 
in addition there were pay boosts for workers who previously 
had seen pay cuts or freezes in previous agreements such as for 
workers in the steel production industry the government said 
for the 12month period ending in september settlements that 
were reached provided wage adjustments averaging 35 percent a year 
over the contract life off slightly from the 36 percent peak 
reached during the previous 12month period 
that peak followed a steady climb in contract gains since a low 
of 17 percent for a 12month period which occurred for the year 
ending in september 1986 
the collective bargaining report showed that workers in 
nonmanufacturing industries won larger pay gains than their 
counterparts in factory jobs settlements in nonmanufacturing 
industries provided average wage gains of 40 percent over the 
contract life while pay gains in settlements in manufacturing 
industries averaged 22 percent over the contract term 
the labor departments broader employment cost index also 
released today showed workers in service and factory jobs winning 
roughly the same size wage gains 
the average construction worker who fell under settled contracts 
received gains of 43 percent a year over the life of the contract 
the government said 
the labor department said the 320 collective bargaining 
agreements it analyzed in the first nine months of 1990 covered 
nearly 16 million workers the government tracks agreements 
covering bargaining units with at least 1000 workers 
the government said 67 such agreements covering about 207000 
workers are scheduled to expire or reopen for wage negotiations 
during the octoberdecember period they are in a variety of 
industries 
in addition there are about 938000 workers under 119 contracts 
that had expired or been reopened but not negotiated or ratified 
prior to the end of september about 350000 of those workers are 
employed in railroads 170000 in the automobile industry and the 
others are in a variety of industries

art lovers are not amused by the action of city 
officials to cover some tiny statues of nude women on display at 
dallas city hall with fig leaves 
the statues by sculptor future akins of lubbock were displayed 
as part of a national art competition sponsored by the dallas 
chapter of the womens caucus for art the exhibit titled 
getting better aint always easy is to be judged nov 2 
yvonne washington assistant director of the park and recreation 
department said city officials acted on their own instincts not 
as a result of any complaints or public outcry 
i think there was possibly too much shock value she said 
im trying to be sensitive to the whole community 
personally i think its time for dallas to wake up said 
bonnie wilber president of the dallas chapter of the womens art 
group bodies are bodies to me this is censorship 
i think it was overreacting and silly and kind of sad akins 
said wednesday i cant imagine in my wildest imagination how 
these pieces would be offensive to anybody 
i thought we were over this censorship thing she added 
maybe dallas doesnt read the papers 
ms washington said her staff contacted the artist and the 
artist agreed to have a friend cover the figures with artificial 
leaves one is inscribed censored 102390 
the leaves are large and the figures are small leaving much of 
the work concealed 
assistant city manager levi davis who was consulted about the 
decision said he did not view the action as censorship but said 
all exhibits at city hall should be screened 
im not in a position to evaluate this from an artist 
standpoint davis said the shock factor is that its next door 
to the office of vital statistics and theres a lot of people a 
lot of children who come through here

that appeared to dash south korean hopes for formal beijingseoul 
ties

teeth said the editorial published in the communist party 
paper the peoples daily 
the editorial marked the 40th anniversary of china sending 
troops to aid the north in the korean war 
the chinese intervention prevented victory by americanled un 
forces fighting on the side of the noncommunist south and 
fighting ended in a stalemate in 1953 
no peace treaty was ever signed and the two sides remain 
formally in a state of war the past few months have seen new 
highlevel northsouth talks but reunification remains distant 
south korea has openly pressed for diplomatic relations with 
china and was a major sponsor of the asian games held in beijing 
this month 
but chinas foreign ministry said last week that its policy of 
not having political contacts with the south was unchanged 
the soviet union and other east bloc countries have recently 
established diplomatic ties with the south while maintaining 
relations with the north

the profound friendship between the chinese and north korean

when sen jesse helms took to the senate 
floor in washington to press his case against obscene art and 
govermentsubsidized filth democrat harvey gantt sought to turn 
the appearance to his own advantage 
helms was betting his case against obscene art would fit nicely 
into his campaign for reelection 
gantt was betting otherwise 
with polls showing the two candidates locked in a tight race 
gantt used a campaign appearance wednesday in cabarrus county to 
criticize helms for forgetting his constituents while he presses a 
farright agenda 
at the same time helms was on the senate floor renewing his 
attack on the national endowment for the arts for subsidizing works 
of filth 
a million dollars has been channeled to my opponent in north 
carolina by artists who claim they have a pipeline to the 
pockets of the american taxpayers said helms 
helms put forward an amendment to sharply constrict the neas 
ability to dole out federal money for works he considers 
objectionable the amendment was defeated 7029 
these artists who have their minds in the gutter are free to 
do whatever they want to do on their own time and with their own 
money said helms but no this crowd wants the american 
taxpayers to pay for that sort of thing and this senator says 
no 
helms gave a forceful but rambling recitation of the recent 
history of the arts controversy he knocked a court ruling in 
cincinnati acquitting a museum and its director of obscenity 
charges for displaying the works of the late photographer robert 
mapplethorpe 
gantt offered a different message 
i want to go to washington to appeal to something else other 
than our worst instincts our fears the former charlotte nc 
mayor told 500 people in a packed courthouse i see government as 
a partner to improve quality of life not run your life 
gantt said helms has gotten so caught up in foreign affairs and 
defense spending he has ignored the middle class he purports to 
represent 
why spend 100 billion on the b2 bomber when our children 
need it more he added to loud applause 
if helms wants to be the champion of the common man he should 
be supporting daycare programs for working mothers a higher 
minimum wage and better health care gantt said 
according to gantt the campaign is about the politics of 
compassion versus the politics of confrontation 
jesses always going to stop the bogeyman from coming over the 
hill whoever it is gantt said in a speech tuesday whether it 
be communists or gays and lesbians or artists 
helms broadside against the nea came amid controversy back home 
over a new television advertisement helms is running the ad seeks 
to link gantt to homosexual groups and asserts the democrat has 
raised large sums of money from the gay community 
gantt who is black suggested that if the clock could be turned 
back the threeterm incumbent would be aiming his campaign 
rhetoric at blacks 
hell always come up with somebody some way to be negative 
and divisive gantt responded but i think those tactics arent 
going to work any more 
last week helms grilled secretary of state james a baker iii 
during a foreign relations committee hearing accusing the state 
department of having exhibited naivete about the intentions of 
iraqs saddam hussein 
he accused the department of abandoning christians in lebanon 
and allowing the united nations to infringe on israeli sovereignty 
what kind of policy do we have when we turn antichristian and 
antijewish in one week he bellowed as baker took his seat at 
the witness table 
to gantt the tirades are symptoms of the same ill 
we have a senator who is out of touch with north carolina who 
is more concerned with making an imprint on foreign policy than on 
educating our children or cleaning up the environment said 
gantt and its time we bring him home

foreign envoys in rwandas capital said 
they saw no evidence of a ceasefire today between the government 
and rebels 
the diplomats had no new reports of fighting but said there had 
been some wednesday when the governmentdeclared ceasefire was 
supposed to take effect 
the state radio reported government troops had killed 320 rebels 
and lost 10 soldiers in fighting on tuesday 
ugandanbased rebels from rwandas minority tutsi tribe invaded 
last month and advanced to within 40 miles northeast of kigali the 
capital the rebels want to overthrow president juvenal 
habyarimanas government 
one western diplomat doubted a ceasefire would hold between the 
rebels who call themselves the rwandese patriotic front and 
rwandas government 
a ceasefire would mean the rebels would stay where they 
are the diplomat said by telephone from kigali that would 
mean giving the rebels part of the country i doubt habyarimana 
would agree to that 
another western envoy said he saw no evidence of a ceasefire 
and that the government had not announced it in rwanda 
the diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity 
on wednesday belgian foreign minister mark eyskens told 
journalists in nairobi that rwandas government had accepted an 
unconditional ceasefire earlier in the day 
eyskens said african nations possibly through the organization 
of african unity should provide a neutral force to monitor the 
ceasefire 
he said belgium rwandas former colonial ruler would provide 
logistical and financial support for such a force 
esykens said he had learned of the halt in fighting by telephone 
from his rwandan counterpart casimir bizimungu ugandas 
president yoweri museveni announced on monday that the rebels had 
accepted a ceasefire 
belgium france and zaire sent troops to rwanda after the rebel 
invasion sept 30 to protect their citizens 
the rebels have insisted foreign troops must leave rwanda before 
they would open talks they also demand habyarimanas troops stop 
killing civilians and that his government release thousands of 
people arested as rebel sympathizers 
the rebels mainly deserters from ugandas army are led by maj 
gen fred rwigyema former deputy army commander in uganda 
the insurgency sprang from an estimated 250000 rwandan refugees 
in uganda the refugees largely belong to the minority tutsis who 
lost power to the majority hutus in a power struggle in late 1950s 
and early 1960s 
hundreds of thousands of tutsis fled to neighboring uganda 
rwanda tanzania and zairem and 10000 were reported killed in 
the fighting

a rightwing coalition scored a 
landslide victory over former prime minister benazir bhutto today 
likely setting pakistans struggling democracy on a more 
conservative islamic course 
ms bhutto who claims her august dismissal was a 
constiutional coup refused to concede the defeat of her 
centerleft pakistan peoples party in wednesdays parliamentary 
election 
she accused the armybacked caretaker government of largescale 
vote rigging a charge that may be difficult to prove 
opponents called the 37yearold ms bhutto a sore loser and 
said the more than 21 victory margin by the looseknit rightwing 
islamic democratic alliance surpassed even their expectations 
in the final vote count almost 24 hours after polls closed ms 
bhuttos pakistan peoples party won only 45 of the 216 
parliamentary races to 105 for her opponents the policymaking 
assembly the lower house of parliament elects the prime minister 
the rest of the seats went to smaller ethnic and religious 
parties and independents voting was postponed in one race because 
of a candidates death 
the people have given their mandate their verdict ms bhutto 
should accept the results and prove to the world that shes a 
democrat caretaker prime minister ghulam mustafa jatoi told a 
news conference today 
a 40member group of international pollwatchers refused 
immediate comment on ms bhuttos assertions of vote fraud but 
said it might discuss its preliminary findings on friday 
the groups assessment could affect hundreds of millions of 
dollars in vital us aid for the government now headed by prime 
minister ghulam mustafa jatoi the united states and other western 
countries have warned they may cut off aid if the election was 
rigged and ms bhutto victimized 
poll watchers were suspicious of some constituencies where they 
witnessed a low voter turnout yet the final vote count showed tens 
of thousands had marked their ballots 
the winning alliance espouses adherence to the principles of 
islam and there is speculation it could tighten controls on the 
media and restrict the rights of women and nonmoslems it also 
favors a closer relationship with the islamic world and more 
distance from the west particularly the united states 
im angry and shocked at the way election has been rigged it 
wasnt even subtle they have stolen the elections said ms 
bhutto who predicted a witch hunt against her family and 
supporters would follow 
the caretaker government has already charged ms bhutto with 
abuse of power and had her husband jailed on charges of kidnapping 
and extortion she says the charges are baseless and aimed at 
destroying her politically 
since the polling agents were not present and ballot boxes 
were stolen i cannot accept these results said ms bhutto 
fighting back tears as she talked with reporters wednesday night in 
larkana her ancestral home in southern sindh province 
the election was widely seen as a verdict on the aug 6 
dismissal of ms bhuttos popularlyelected government by president 
ghulam ishaq khan who claimed hers was the most corrupt and inept 
government in pakistans 43 years 
most analysts and opinion polls had predicted a close race 
between ms bhuttos party and its three smaller allies and the 
alliance a coalition spanning the ideological spectrum and united 
only in contempt for ms bhutto 
yet voter turnout was low contrasting with the emotionally 
charged atmosphere that heralded the return to democracy in 
november 1988 after a decade of military rule 
analysts said wednesdays numbers reflected the growing cynicism 
about the countrys future and disenchantment with both ms bhutto 
and her opponents 
despite the presence of nearly 100000 security forces at least 
nine people were killed and 66 others injured in clashes between 
rival parties during the voting 
alliance leaders who easily won their parliamentary seats 
included prime minister jatoi and his son murtaza ms bhuttos 
chief rival nawaz sharif and ijaz ulhaq the eldest son of gen 
mohammad zia ulhaq pakistans last military dictator 
ms bhutto and her mother nusrat were the only winners among 
the 11 women candidates 
the ousted prime ministers controversial and flamboyant 
husband asif ali zardari won the seat to represent lyari the 
sprawling karachi slum but lost in his home constituency of 
nawabshah in the heart of sindh 
the 38yearold businessman is in jail being held without bail 
ms bhutto said she had reports of rigging in at least 80 
constituencies and accused the caretaker government of suffing and 
stealing ballot boxes and intimidating and harrassing voters to 
keep them away from polling booths 
shes a sore loser haqqani said after a few days shell 
have to accept it 
the westerneducated ms bhutto became the first woman leader of 
a modern moslem nation in december 1988 just months after zia died 
in a mysterious plane crash that also claimed the life of the us 
ambassador 
she spent 20 troubled months in office 
ms bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown as 
prime minister in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later after zia 
refused to pardon him

or in the words of the uniform time act which set up the 
system of switching between daylight and standard times clocks are 
retarded an hour at 0200 on the last sunday in october

in the evening with that hour of light shifted back to the morning 
hours to get the nation off to work on the right foot 
clocks will be advanced to daylight time the first sunday of 
next april 2 
while the official switch to standard time covers most of the

for the second time in two weeks the 
united states has joined a unanimous security council vote rebuking 
israel this time for not cooperating with a un investigation of 
the temple mount killings 
not even a lastditch personal appeal from president bush to 
prime minister yitzhak shamir persuaded israel to change its mind 
and officially receive the un investigators 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said today that he 
would meet the israeli ambassador to confirm their refusal to my 
mission 
if that is the case that they continue to block my mission i 
will start preparing my report to the security council he told 
reporters on entering un headquarters 
perez de cuellar said last week that if israel doesnt cooperate 
with the un investigation he would have no option but to limit 
his report to ways of protecting palestinians in the occupied 
territories seized by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
top aides to shamir said today that israel will ignore the new 
un resolution and claimed that washington was coerced into voting 
for the measure to preserve its alliance with arab countries 
opposing iraq 
we are sorry because this helps saddam hussein to distract 
attention from what is happening in the gulf to what is 
happening in jerusalem said shamir spokesman avi pazner 
the un resolution approved 150 on wednesday is largely 
symbolic no sanctions against israel are expected said british 
ambassador david hannay who is president of the council for 
october 
still hannay said israels treatment of palestinians is not 
going to go away from the council agenda the principal loser by 
not receiving the un mission will be israel 
israeli security forces trying to quell a riot opened fire and 
killed 19 palestinians on jerusalems sacred temple mount on oct 
8 beforehand arabs had thrown a volley of stones on jews praying 
below at the western wall 
israel has since seen a spate of arabisraeli revenge attacks 
in response israeli authorities sealed off the occupied 
territories wednesday preventing palestinians from getting to jobs 
in israel 
on oct 12 the united states broke with past practice and 
joined a 150 council vote denouncing israeli security forces for 
the shootings on the temple mount in which about 140 palestinians 
were wounded 
that resolution asked perez de cuellar to send a delegation to 
investigate and submit a report on the killings 
israel fears that accepting the un mission would be tantamount 
to accepting world objections to israels annexation of 
predominantly arab east jerusalem captured with the west bank and 
gaza strip in the 1967 war 
the resolution approved wednesday deplores the refusal of the 
israeli government to receive the mission and insists that 
israel permit the mission to proceed in keeping with its 
purpose 
the vote was delayed from tuesday so bush could contact shamir 
urging him to receive the un mission so the security council 
could resume its series of resolutions condemning iraqs invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 
the united states had been under intense pressure from arab and 
other states not to veto the resolution and risk eroding the 
fragile coalition arrayed against iraq which depends on moderate 
arab states such as egypt saudi arabia and morocco 
the israeli government denounced wednesdays resolution in 
advance saying it would not cooperate and calling the council 
hypocritical 
israeli ambassador johanan bein told reporters the security 
council was exercising a double standard in criticizing israel 
while arabs are attacking jews in israel in retaliation for the 
killings on the temple mount which is sacred to both moslems and 
jews 
more than 750 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops 
and civilians in the 34monthold palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation 
the security council includes five permanent members with veto 
power the united states britain china france and the soviet 
union and the nonpermanent members canada colombia cuba 
ethiopia finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen and zaire

an international antidrug crackdown dubbed 
southern star has resulted in 3743 arrests and the seizure of 
millions of dollars in cash and drugs authorities said 
fugitives on state federal and international charges from new 
zealand to bermuda were rounded up during the 10week effort along 
with 128 million in cash property drugs guns and other 
contraband 
the operation marked a new level of coordination between the 
us marshals service and 28 state and local agencies in the war 
on drugs said us attorney general dick thornburgh who reported 
the sweep wednesday 
were making considerable progress in upping the ante for 
those who are intent upon feeding the appetite that unfortunately 
still exists in the united states for illegal drugs he said 
but he conceded that the federal government was not in a 
position to say if the operation had actually cut into drug sales 
in the united states 
authorities said those arrested were tracked through 32 states 
and several foreign countries 
foreign fugitives have too long been able to flee from one 
country to another financed by lucrative international criminal 
activities said k michael moore director of the us marshals 
service 
they assume that the various law enforcement officers dont 
have the time or resources to track them across international 
jurisdictions operation southern star proves them wrong moore 
said 
eleven of those arrested were wanted for murder and one of the 
fugitives charles bryatt was wanted in new zealand on charges of 
cocaine smuggling and conspiracy to supply lsd 
along with bryant federal authorities singled out several other 
fugitives as principal targets of southern star 
gregory rodgers wanted on a kansas cocaine distribution charge 
was tracked down in the central american country of belize and 
deported to miami for arrest 
one florida fugitive richard joseph lynn was tracked through 
alabama georgia florida louisiana mexico and guatemala before 
he was arrested at a restaurant in gulfport miss 
the most prominent drug cache seized was 150 pounds of cocaine 
that was found underneath imported seafood on a south american 
airliner in miami two days later us customs service inspectors 
at the same airport found 100 pounds of cocaine from lima peru in 
a box labeled books

president bush took a break from the budget 
battles today to escort actress bo derek on a tour of the white 
house grounds 
the actress was in town for the washington international horse 
show according to the white house press office she called and 
wanted to see the white house said spokeswoman alixe glen 
bush had delayed a trip to the west coast canceling campaign 
appearances in arizona and new mexico because of the precarious 
state of negotiations as congress and the administration sought 
agreement on a 500billion deficitreduction package 
the president early this morning averted shutdown of the 
government by signing a temporary spending measure that will keep 
operations going until midnight saturday there were no scheduled 
activities on his public agenda for the day 
but it became apparent that an oval office meeting was in 
progress when a group of young male white house male aides began to 
cluster in the hallways 
they were soon joined by a gaggle of reporters and 
photographers all pressed against the glass doors looking out on 
the rose garden for a glimpse of the blonde actress 
the president was seen escorting her and her husband john

the bush administration believes the middle 
east will never be secure as long as iraqi leader saddam hussein 
remains in power unless his weapons are destroyed cia director 
william webster said today 
can you put him back in his box webster asked rhetorically 
referring to saddam 
webster said the administration had no real confidence that 
the area will ever be secure again as long as he is still there 
unless a regional countervailing force is put in place or he 
is disassociated from his weapons of mass destruction 
webster also said unimposed sanctions against iraq were 
beginning to have an effect forcing saddams government to take 
steps to restructure its economic program in order to feed its 
people and meet the needs of the military 
sanctions imposed after saddam invaded kuwait on aug 2 have 
cut off 98 percent of iraqs oil exports and 95 percent of its 
imports 
although saddam has long crushed any internal dissent within 
iraq webster said intelligence analysts have received some 
encouraging reports of a little dissatisfaction within the 
country 
webster speaking at a breakfast meeting of the national council 
of world affairs organizations did not elaborate on the nature of 
the discontent and said analysts have yet to conclude how 
significant it is 
drawing a parallel between saddam and deposed panamanian leader 
manuel noriega webster noted noriega was able to stay in power 
despite a coup attempt noriega was dislodged by the invasion of 
us troops last december 
over time webster speculated there would be growing discontent 
against saddam from his top aides they are the only ones with 
enough access to take action against saddam 
the cia is forbidden under law from taking part in the 
assassination of a foreign leader 
webster said it was difficult to interpret saddams motives 
because the leader is isolated frequently taking counsel only from 
his brother 
but he said saddams willingness to use weapons of mass 
destruction his ties to terrorist groups his appeal to arab and 
muslim solidarity and his playing upon regional economic 
frustration represent a real threat 
for the time being saddam appears to be reinforcing his defense 
positions inside kuwait webster said adding that he was skeptical 
about reports and rumors that saddam wanted to withdraw from kuwait 
with the exception of an oil field and two islands that would give 
him access to the sea 
saddams immediate goal apparently is to hold out against 
sanctions hoping eventually to see fissures in the blockade 
against him webster said

defense secretary dick cheney said today the 
united states will continue its military buildup in the persian 
gulf perhaps adding as many as 100000 more troops 
were not at the point yet where we want to stop adding 
forces cheney said 
he declined to say how many troops might be added to the us 
deployment which now totals 220000 troops in and around saudi 
arabia but when asked if adding 100000 troops was possible 
cheney said its conceivable that well end up with that big an 
increase 
pentagon sources said wednesday the deployment would reach the 
planned level of 240000 in three weeks but cheney said the 
administration never put an upper ceiling on the deployment 
his comments came as president bush faced several decisions 
about the makeup of the gulf forces and as his top uniformed 
commander gen colin powell headed home from talks with ground 
commanders in saudi arabia the talks included discussion of adding 
more offensive might to the us forces 
meanwhile cia director william webster said the bush 
administration believes the middle east will never be secure as 
long as iraqi leader saddam hussein remains in power unless his 
weapons are destroyed 
he said the administration had no real confidence that the 
area will ever be secure again as long as he is still there 
unless a regional countervailing force is put in place or he 
is disassociated from his weapons of mass destruction 
the usled multinational forces now total more than 300000 
but still fall far short of the estimated 430000 iraqi troops 
deployed in heavily fortified positions in occupied kuwait and 
southern iraq 
pentagon planners noting a recent decline in polls of public 
support for the desert deployment have urged cheney and other 
senior administration officials to articulate their reasons clearly 
should they decide to expand the force 
cheney said the administration still hoped for a peaceful 
solution to the standoff with iraqs saddam hussein but wanted to 
make sure its force in the region offered bush the option of 
ordering an offensive 
we want to make certain weve got the forces over there to 
deal with any ontingency cheney said on cbs this morning on 
abcs good morning america he said weve not yet settled on 
an upper limit in terms of our total deployment so for a number of 
reasons i would expect a continuing flow of forces to the gulf in 
the period ahead 
the pentagon sources speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said that if more troops were sent to the region they likely would 
be heavy tank divisions either from the united states or europe 
these sources also said it was possible some nonessential units 
might be brought home by christmas with the 82nd airborne division 
a likely candidate 
cheney said it was entirely possible that the 82nd would be 
rotated out and additional heavy units sent in but he said no 
decision had been made 
even if the united states subbed a tank division for the 82nd 
we still wouldnt have an offensive force to be comfortable 
with a pentagon source said today this source said no 
additional ground units have been ordered to the region 
the american buildup hit a symbolic juncture wednesday with the 
arrival in saudi arabia of the final elements of the 11th air 
defense brigade from fort bliss texas it was the last combat unit 
scheduled for deployment in the region pentagon sources said 
the only remaining troops scheduled as of wednesday to be sent 
to the area following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait are support 
units due to arrive over the next three weeks bringing the 
deployment to 240000 
there appears to be little domestic or international support for 
a unilateral us offensive however 
barring some action by iraq that would bring consensus for an 
attack pentagon sources and military analysts consider it far more 
likely that bush will make small changes to the force 
we would have to double the force there to make an offensive 
palatable from a military standpoint said lawrence j korb a 
former assistant defense secretary for manpower in the reagan 
administration i dont think that is very likely id set up 
a rotation plan but basically keep my troop level about where it 
is 
the 82nd airborne is the first candidate to come home because it 
was the first to arrive in saudi arabia is lightly armed and not 
designed for a tank war also many of its troops spent last 
christmas in panama as part of the us invasion force 
withdrawing the paratroopers one of the armys premier 
rapiddeployment offensive units would signal that we are going 
to hunker down and wait right along with saddam one source said 
in addition a pentagon official said wed look good bringing 
some people home for christmas even if in the big scheme of things 
it didnt amount to much this official said the 82nd could be 
sent back to the region after the holdidays 
the pentagon sources said draft rotation plans call for 
sixmonth rotations for most units which would mean the first 
largescale substitutions would occur in february some units that 
are harder to replace may have to spend more time in the country 
than we or they would like one source said 
the sequence of the rotations is still under discussion with an 
announcement expected within two weeks this source said

british officials are expressing horror at the 
iras latest tactic taking a family hostage and forcing one 
member to drive a bombladen vehicle into an army checkpoint in 
northern ireland 
the ira attacks on checkpoints at the border with the irish 
republic on wednesday killed six british soldiers and a civilian 
and injured 35 people 
the attacks were expected to dominate irishbritish talks in 
london today 
police in the republic of ireland questioned eight men today 
about a series of attacks including ira bombings in northern 
ireland a spokesman for the irish police the garda said six of 
them would appear in a special criminal court in dublin on 
unspecified charges 
but the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
charges were not in connection with wednesdays bombings the eight 
men were arrested near the border with northern ireland after 
wednesdays attacks 
northern ireland secretary peter brooke the british cabinet 
member responsible for the province said on wednesday that the 
irish republican army had sunk to new levels of depravity by 
using people whose families have been held hostage as human 
bombs 
it is hard to imagine anything more evil than tying a man into 
his car laden with explosives and then forcing him to drive to 
where the bomb was detonated he told the house of commons 
in new violence today the outlawed paramilitary organization 
ulster freedom fighters claimed responsibility for the killing of a 
man whose body was found by two schoolgirls in a protestant housing 
project in south belfast 
the royal ulster constabulary said the 28yearold protestant 
man had been questioned by police wednesday about terrorist acts 
he was the 10th person to die in political and sectarian violence 
in the britishruled provinc in four days 
brooke irish foreign minister gerry collins and police chiefs 
from both sides of the irish border were to take part a meeting in 
london today under the 1985 angloirish agreement 
meetings are regularly held under the accord which gives the 
irish republic a formal consultative role in the running of 
northern ireland and provides for cooperation between security 
forces on both sides of the border 
police in northern ireland said that in simultaneous predawn 
attacks wednesday the ira forced three roman catholic civilians it 
said had collaborated with security forces to drive bombladen 
vehicles to their targets 
five soldiers died in the attack on a army checkpoint near 
londonderry 65 miles northwest of belfastthe body of patsy 
gillespie who drove the bombladen van while ira guerrillas held 
his family hostage was found wednesday night at the scene of the 
blast 
another soldier died in a similar attack on a army checkpoint 
near newry 35 miles south of belfast 
but in that case the man who drove the bombladen van while the 
ira held his relatives captive managed to flee the vehicle and 
shout a warning before the explosion 
in a third attack on an army base at omagh about 50 miles west 
of belfast guerrillas strapped the driver into his bombladen 
trailer told him to drive to the target and followed in a car 
while other guerrillas held his family captive but the man managed 
to get free and the bomb failed to go off 
hospitals said a total of 35 people including two 9monthold 
babies were injured in the londonderry and newry attacks 
police in the irish republic said today that they were holding a 
total of eight men arrested wednesday under antiterrorist 
legislation just across the border from the checkpoint near 
londonderry 
but they refused to say if the men are believed connected with 
the attack they can be held without charge for 48 hours 
the british domestic news agency press association quoted 
unnamed security sources as saying it was thought the eight were 
arrested in a process of eliminating possible suspects from 
investigations in the area 
in a message to news organizations the ira claimed 
responsibility for the three attacks 
it said the three men forced to drive the bombs were 
collaborators because they had performed construction work for the 
security forces 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland it wants to unite the predominantly protestant 
province with the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland under 
socialist rule

a jury today found a man innocent of 
killin a boston police detective in a case that raised questions 
about whether investigators lied and doctored evidence 
albert lewin 34 a jamaican immigrant was accused of firing 
the shots that blasted through a closed apartment door and killed 
detective sherman griffiths 36 during a drug raid on feb 17 
1988 
the franklin superior court jury deliberated for 3 hours and 40 
minutes over two days before acquitting lewin the case was moved 
to this western massachusetts community because of pretrial 
publicity 
former detective carlos luna who was a partner of griffiths 
testified that police lied in an attempt to cover up the 
inadequacies of a search warrant used for the drug raid luna is 
one of two officers indicted for their alleged role in the coverup 
luna testified at lewins trial that his superiors and a boston 
prosecutor encouraged him to concoct a story that a supposed 
informant named in the search warrant had either died or left town 
in fact police have admitted there was no such informant named 
john 
in his final arguments defense attorney max d stern maintained 
the boston police forfeited their reputation in trying to build a 
case against lewin 
trust is a precious commodity stern said wednesday it is 
not in endless supply and when officers of the law bend that law 
when they twist that law when they break that law they do not 
deserve that trust any more 
assistant suffolk county district attorney thomas j mundy 
acknowledged that the evidence against lewin who was in an 
apartment with several other people was circumstantial 
the only physical evidence linking lewin with the murder weapon 
was a fingerprint on the gun and stern sharply challenged the 
authenticity of the print which surfaced 30 months after the 
crime 
an fbi expert testified he discovered the print and was 
convinced it was authentic but two defense witnesses including a 
retired fingerprint expert with the state police testified there 
were signs the print may have been transferred onto the gun

albanias balkan neighbors today gave 
only qualified support for its quest to take part in european 
affairs and greece insisted the isolated hardline communist 
nation make human rights reforms 
albanias attempt to gain international acceptance also was 
damaged by the defection today of its most famous author to france 
the author ismail karare announced he would seek political 
asylum because there was no possibility of legal opposition in 
his homeland 
word of karares defection reached tirana just after the foreign 
ministers meeting closed and there was no immediate official 
albanian reaction 
albania the host of its first highlevel international 
conference in decades hopes to be invited to join the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe in time for its summit 
meeting in paris next month 
but balkan foreign ministers today did not give albania a clear 
endorsement for partipation in the summit 
the ministers said only that they welcomed the request of 
albania for full participation in the csce and expressed their 
wish to see it realized 
albania was the sole european nation not to sign the helsinki 
final act in 1975 the document that began the european conference 
process 
to be admitted albania is likely to have to take human rights 
reform further than it has to date 
reforms introduced this year have slightly eased the complete 
ban on religious activities and have allowed a few thousand of the 
countrys 3 million citizens to travel abroad 
but the communist albanian labor party has given no signal it 
will tolerate other political parties or allow freedom of 
expression 
we need some tangible proof that they are indeed walking this 
path said foreign minister antonis samaras of greece the only 
country to publicly take albania to task for its human rights 
record at the twoday meeting 
with kadares defection albania is even less likely to get 
enough support from the 34 nations in the conference the united 
states the soviet union canada and all the rest of europe to 
participate fully at the paris summit 
kadare the head of the albanian writers union had been seen 
as one of albanias leading reformers 
albanias quest to take part in europen affairs places its 
rulers in a difficult position they can either accelerate reform 
which could provoke violent upheaval or approach the change 
gradually and thus fail to make the desired foreign contacts 
this summer about 5000 albanians took refuge in embassies in 
tirana and eventually were allowed to emigrate

five freed americans enjoyed a homecoming that was overshadowed 
by fears for colleagues still held captive in iraq and nine more 
former us hostages were flying to the united states today 
in washington cia director william webster said today the 
middle east will never be secure as long as saddam hussein remains 
in power unless the iraqi presidents weapons are destroyed 
regarding the french hostages western diplomatic sources in 
baghdad said french citizens given permission this week to depart 
iraq will begin leaving on saturday more than 300 french citizens 
are among the thousands of foreigners who were trapped in iraq 
after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
france has said it would not make any concessions in exchange 
for the freeing of its nationals but the iraqi governmentrun 
daily newspaper aljumhouriya said today that france would withdraw 
some of its forces from the persian gulf region it cited 
unidentified official sources in paris

2000 sailors aboard 14 ships in the region as part of the 
predominantly american multinational force

220000 troops could grow substantially in coming weeks defense

german foreign ministers to visit his country and held out the 
prospect that some of their nationals could be released if they did

allies are viewed by our guys as cynical exploitative of the 
hostages and i think congress agrees with that assessment 
webster meanwhile told the national council of world affairs 
organizations that saddams willingness to use weapons of mass 
destruction his ties to terrorist groups his appeal to arab and 
muslim solidarity and his playing upon regional economic 
frustration make him a continuing threat to longterm peace in

new yorks kennedy airport aboard a royal jordanian airlines

italian foreign minister gianni de michelis has 
become a familiar figure in recent months as he travels the world 
to espouse his vision of a europe ready to throw its weight on the 
international stage 
de michelis has used italys presidency of the european 
community to promote a series of ambitious initiatives and 
proposals ranging from a mediterranean peace conference to an ec 
military role 
italys sixmonth term which has drawn criticism from some 
diplomats recently reaches an important stage this weekend at a 
summit meeting of the 12 ec leaders in rome 
de michelis says the officials will discuss the persian gulf 
crisis the ecs relations with the soviet union and other east 
european countries and the process of economic monetary and 
political union 
as the head of government italian premier giulio andreotti will 
chair the summit but the real guiding force behind italys 
activist ec presidency has been de michelis a rotund ebullient 
rapidfire talker who relaxes after council meetings by going disco 
dancing 
among the projects he has promoted 
the pentagonal initiative a grouping of italy austria 
hungary yugoslavia and czechoslovakia designed to bolster 
political and economic development in central and eastern europe as 
a counterweight to a unified germany 
a similar alliance of four west european countries and five 
arab states of north africa to work for political and economic 
stability in the mediterranean region 
a joint proposal with spain to hold a conference on peace and 
security in the mediterranean possibly extending to the entire 
middle east on the lines of the helsinki conference on european 
security 
a proposal for the ec to assume a formal military dimension by 
absorbing the western european union a body which loosely 
coordinates defense policies of nine ec states 
a proposal for a meeting of ec and arab foreign ministers to 
discuss the gulf crisis 
of these only the pentagonal initiative seems to have achieved 
success 
the proposal for a mediterranean peace conferenee has been 
stalled by the complexities of the middle east conflicts the idea 
of an ec military arm has been opposed by neutral ireland while 
britain and other states say nato should remain the lynchpin of 
european security 
perhaps most embarrassing for de michelis was the cancellation 
of a scheduled meeting in venice earlier this month of ec and arab 
league foreign ministers several arab states refused to come 
because iraq was not invited de michelis says he still hopes the 
meeting can be held perhaps in november 
sniping against italys chairmanship has grown in recent weeks 
the british magazine the economist said that while de michelis 
has generated many ideas diplomats believe he is unable to 
channel them constructively 
italys presidency is proving like a bus trip with the marx 
brothers in the drivers seat the economist quoted a senior 
brussels diplomat as saying 
a lot of talk but little action is how the wall street 
journal summed up the view in brussels 
italy has brushed off the criticism arguing that europe needs 
to be more active in keeping up with the rapid changes in the 
world 
italy has always considered itself one of the staunchest 
advocates of european unity and integration in a referendum last 
year more than 80 percent of italians supported the idea of giving 
the european parliament powers to draft a new treaty of european 
union 
when italy took over the rotating ec presidency in july the 
main priority was to speed up the communitys process of political 
economic and monetary integration 
but since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the ec has been forced 
to deal with issues of security and europes role beyond its 
immediate borders 
while the ec members swiftly agreed on sweeping economic 
sanctions against iraq the consensus frayed over the military 
response to back them up only britain and france have committed 
ground troops to the multinational gulf force 
this weekends summit will bring together the 12 ec leaders for 
the first time since the gulf crisis began but it was not planned 
that way 
the meeting is listed as an emergency summit even though it was 
scheduled before italy took over the presidency rome apparently 
wanted to keep up with its predecessors france and ireland which 
called emergency summits to deal with changes in eastern europe and 
german reunification

police vexed at the folkhero following of 
lawrencia bambi bembenek say the convicted killer showed her 
true colors when she created a phony identity after her prison 
escape 
ms bembenek a 32yearold former model milwaukee police 
officer and playboy club waitress was captured earlier this month 
in canada months after breaking out of a wisconsin prison she was 
serving a life sentence for murder 
she had faced a deportation hearing today in thunder bay 
ontario where she was captured oct 17 but the hearing was 
delayed for a week this morning after he lawyers requested more 
time to prepare their response to illegal immigration charges and 
also sought to bar news media from the hearing 
there is a tradition in canada that we try people in court we 
dont try them in the media said david dubinski a lawyer for 
ms bembenek 
adjudicator carmen decarlo delayed a decision on media access 
until next week and told ms bembeneks lawyers theyll need to 
present arguments then if they need further delays for the 
deportation hearing 
ms bembenek had claimed she was framed for the killing and 
supporters who argued she deserved a new trial cheered her escape 
in july and took to wearing run bambi run tshirts 
but authorities said wednesday a bogus resume she used to find 
work in canada shows her capacity for deceit 
it certainly does take a little of the luster off the bembenek 
legend said fond du lac county sheriffs lt ed sheppard 
the resume identified her as jennifer voelkel gazanna born jan 
7 1961 a child named jennifer lee voelkel born the same date 
died at one month and was buried in a milwaukee cemetery police 
said ms bembenek may have obtained the dead childs birth 
certificate and used it to establish a false identity 
the resume said she was a prison social worker for nine years 
and served as a member of the governors advisory council on aids 
it also contained a bogus educational background 
ms bembenek 32 was fired from the milwaukee police force for 
lying on a report prosecutors convinced a jury she killed her 
husbands exwife in 1981 because she disliked the amount of 
alimony the woman received 
after a tip from someone who recognized her from the tv show 
americas most wanted she was captured in thunder bay where 
she was working as a waitress her fiance dominic gugliatto 35 
also was arrested 
a private detective trying to help ms bembenek get a new trial 
said authorities were desperately trying to besmirch her claims of 
innocence 
no one who escaped from prison would tell the truth on a resume 
ira robins said that is absolutely ridiculous 
the milwaukee investigator said he has evidence that ms 
bembenek was framed because she had knowledge of police corruption 
but he complained that few are willing to listen 
there has been no investigation of the corruption i have 
pointed out he said i am trying to get a woman some 
justice

managers of an apartment complex have forced most 
residents to remove american flags flown in support of us forces 
in the persian gulf saying the flags were a safety hazard 
two veterans groups denounced the apartment management as 
unpatriotic 
most residents of the plantation apartments were defiant 
wednesday saying the management was being unamerican but by the 
end of the day most complied removing the small flags that have 
been flying since midseptember 
about 30 residents had displayed the flags which hung from 
30inch wooden poles outside near the apartment doors residents 
were given notices monday and tuesday to remove the flags or 
maintenance workers would dispose of them 
apartment officials said they will allow flags to be displayed 
on doors and windows as long as they dont create a hazard 
we like the residents who are complaining are behind our 
boys in the mideast all the way said sylvia rizk chairman of 
houston international management co which manages the complex 
patriotism should never be abused by using it as a reason to 
disregard safe practices 
the safety concern rizk said was that the flags jutted into 
passageways even though they were hung well above eye level the 
management company also complained that residents had drilled holes 
in exterior walls for the flags 
joe coyle spokesman for korvets the texas chapter of the 
korean war veterans association said the order to remove the flags 
was unpatriotic whatever the reason he said his organization 
would back any residents who want to fight the move 
the national president of the brotherhood for vietnam veterans 
who is a houston resident also denounced the management companys 
actions 
it causes me to wonder just where the priorities are for these 
folks living in this country sibley cooley said obviously 
these people who wanted to fly the flags wanted to fly it because 
they had a deeper sense of commitment and patriotism

i think its way bad to maryland where vincent broco 
described the us government as a circus antiwashington 
sentiment is running deeper than the deficit 
in tampa theres a group called throw the rascals out 
radio callin shows across the country hear strong antiwashington 
sentiments the albuquerque nm tribune set up a phone line for 
readers who want to complain newspaper ads have suggested that all 
incumbents be tossed overboard 
the showdown over a new budget between congress and president 
bush has been about as popular as roseanne barrs rendition of the 
national anthem the district of columbia is now the district of 
contempt 
they would have to clean washington right out completely and 
start over said don hart who was running errands wednesday in 
downtown traverse city mich disgusted isnt the word mad 
would be a better one 
many everyday americans interviewed around the country this week 
said they were following the budget battle closely and didnt like 
what they saw from bush on down no one appeared immune to wrath 
politicians performances seem to have gotten worse over the years 
people said and this year is the worst yet 
im pretty upset about it actually said neil tucker a 
34yearold commercial real estate broker in baltimore we elect 
these people to represent us and theyre more concerned with their 
special interests and getting reelected than voting their 
convictions 
i blame leadership tucker added i blame the people in 
congress theyre all basically a bunch of jokers 
im not going to vote for a single incumbent said tomas 
martinez a new mexico state government clerk who lives in 
albuquerque i think its time to give others a chance maybe 
theyll think more like a consumer like a taxpayer rather than 
remaining in office feathering their own nest 
polls show public confidence in government is at a twodecade 
low and bushs approval ratings at their lowest levels of his 
presidency 
congress approval ratings are even lower a newsweek poll 
found 52 percent would be willing to fire the whole congress and a

larry nusbaum an artist displaying his acrylics on the santa 
fe nm plaza blamed the american people more than congress or 
bush for the budget fiasco the public makes so many conflicting 
demands on the federal government he said 
nusbaum said his opinion of congress wasnt very high to begin 
with but i can understand their dilemma 
its not congress its us they receive the messages from us 
we get the government that we deserve you can blame the government 
all you want to and that doesnt cut the cake nusbaum said 
tax increases expected in the new budget are a particular sore 
spot 
mcabee the texas retiree who sells handmade pillows and quilts 
from a roadside stand complained that the rich should shoulder a 
heavier burden increasing cigarette gasoline and beer taxes will 
hit the workingclass hard he said 
they didnt tax wine because thats what they drink mcabee 
said but some poor bastard who has to buy gasoline to drive to 
work and have a cold beer when he gets home theyre going to tax

starvation of apocalyptic proportions is 
endangering as many as 11 million sudanese but their government is 
blocking international food deliveries us relief officials said 
thursday 
administration officials testifying before the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa said sudans military government 
refused to recognize the danger and has derailed a usled rescue 
under un auspices that would have saved many sudanese from 
hunger 
the government in khartoum has been increasingly indifferent 
if not overtly hostile to the relief efforts said andrew 
natsios the administrations top relief official 
due to drought and civil war this years harvest could fall 
short by as much as one million metric tons leaving up to eight 
million sudanese to starve he said 
other relief organizations put the number of those in danger as 
high as 11 million said roger winter director of the private us 
committee for refugees 
if the actual level of need is as high as some people fear 
and the donor community is not allowed to respond we are looking 
at an apocalyptic situation worse than in ethiopia in 1984 said 
natsios director of the office of foreign disaster assistance an 
estimated 250000 ethiopians died of hunger in that famine 
about 75 percent of the sudanese at risk live in governmentheld 
territory and the rest in rebelheld lands in southern sudan 
us officials accuse the government which seized power in a 
military coup 16 months ago of preventing food from reaching the 
south where the sudans people liberation army has been fighting 
for autonomy since 1983 
the spla too has used food in its war shooting down relief 
planes and attacking trains and truck convoys carrying food from 
neighboring kenya 
sudanese planes last month bombed several towns in the south 
which serve as center of operation lifeline sudan prompting the 
united states to temporarily suspend its sales of wheat to the 
government and to recall ambassador james cheek to washington for 
consultations 
but the government has also prevented food supplies from 
reaching areas it controls and has spurned us urgings to call for 
international help as a result of this attitude and of the 
harassment of relief workers natsios said european donors have 
all but stopped helping 
the united states natsios said is willing to provide onethird 
of an emergency 300000ton food shipment needed to avert mass 
starvation an estimated 50000 tons of us donated food are 
already been stored in sudan he added 
but unless the sudanese government allows relief workers to 
distribute the food and turns to the international community for 
more help we will not be able to respond in time if the call for 
help goes out after people start dying 
winter said he traveled to sudan last month out of concern 
that famine of biblical dimensions was building he suggested the 
united states lead a campaign for international economic sanctions 
against sudans government of the type imposed on iraq for its 
invasion of kuwait 
but administration officials doubted this would be much help 
the united states has stopped everything except emergency aid to 
sudan and so levers of traditional pressure are not available 
said jeffrey davidow acting assistant secretary of state for 
africa 
and theres not much of an economy left that we can embargo 
added natsios civil war years of government incompetence and 
isolation by the world community have wreaked havoc on sudans 
economy he said 
sudans military suppliers are iraq libya and china countries 
with which the united states has little influence davidow said 
officials predict the arms flow from iraq will be limited by the 
international embargo on president saddam hussein the sudanese 
government has also been cut off by other benefactors saudi 
arabia and kuwait as a result of its support for saddam the 
officials said 
i would like to emphasize that sudans position on the 
iraqkuwait crisis does not affect in any way us relief 
operations davidow said we are not using food as a weapon

declining consumer confidence and the persian 
gulf crisis pushed september sales of existing homes down 8 
percent a real estate trade group reported thursday it was the 
slowest pace in nearly three years 
the national association of realtors said resales totaled a 
seasonally adjusted 322 million houses the slowest pace since a 
320 million rate in january 1988 
all regions posted sales declines except for the northeast 
which was unchanged from an already low level the august rate had 
been 350 million 
realtors president norman d flynn said declining confidence in 
the economy has been fueled by uncertainty over the impact of 
federal budget legislation and the persian gulf situation 
consumers dont know what to expect flynn said when 
people dont know whats coming they tend to delay bigticket 
expenditures many of them put their home buying plans on hold 
the south led the sales decline falling 100 percent to an 
annual rate of 126 million units 
in addition to consumer confidence realtors chief economist 
john a tuccillo said the deployment of military troops from 
southern bases to the persian gulf decreased demand for houses and 
upset the local economies 
the military pullout has taken more buyers from the 
marketplace than the ones sent overseas tuccillo said 
companies in those areas that rely on military business are 
hurting the economic fallout has interrupted purchase plans of 
civilians 
the commerce department next tuesday will report on september 
new home sales sales of new homes fell 14 percent in august to a 
550000 annual rate 
thomas holloway an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said higher interest rates rising unemployment and 
the uncertainty of middle east developments will keep the housing 
market sluggish for months to come 
but holloway said the september existing home sales was not as 
negative as shown on the surface 
noting the jump in sales to 35 million units in august he said 
the average of the two months comes out to 33 million houses 
right in line with the level of sales in the previous four 
months 
according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
30year fixedrate mortgages averaged between 1019 percent and 
1022 percent in september the rates generally were higher than 
the average during the first half of the year 
buyers scaled back their purchases partly because of slightly 
higher rates flynn said but economic uncertainty played a 
much bigger role 
the median price of an existing home nationally fell 29 
percent to 94300 the median means half of the homes cost more 
half less 
the west posted a resale rate of 520000 units down 88 
percent the median home price was 134700 a 39 percent decline 
from august 
sales in the midwest were off 71 percent to 920000 units the 
median price was 74000 a 17 percent drop 
sales in the northeast remained unchanged at 520000 despite a 
56 percent drop in the median price to 137100 
the median price in the south was 85900 down 12 percent from 
august

brazil has rejected a proposal to 
remove fax machines from a list of products barred from import a 
list that includes personal computers and automatic bank teller 
machines 
the decision wednesday night by a government commission over 
the objections of brazils communications secretary keeps the 
facsimile mail machines among imported items banned in an effort to 
encourage local manufacturers 
communications secretary joel rauber said it was unfair to keep 
brazilians from acquiring imported machines which cost less than 
onethird the price of domestic models 
a thriving industry has sprouted up in smuggled faxes federal 
police often make surprise baggage inspections at international 
airports not for drugs or machineguns but for faxes and laptop 
computers 
federal agents also raid offices demanding to see local receipts 
for faxes and computers if proof of brazilian manufacture is not 
forthcoming police seize the machines 
rauber had argued that fax machines had become part of 
everyday office use and personal communications 
the governments computerandautomationpolicy council didnt 
get the message 
science and technology secretary jose goldemberg who also is 
the head of the council said allowing imports of faxes would wreck 
braziliarm bill after the gatt talks end on dec 31 
the national grange has said the 136 billion cut ordered for 
usda programs represented unilateral disarmament by the united 
states in the trade talks the granges national master robert 
barrow said the costs of trimming the budget deficit should be 
borne more equitably 
rob nooter of the american farm bureau federations washington 
office said wednesday that the farm bill and its tie to the 500 
billion budgetreduction package is certainly going to have an 
impact on farm income 
some of the income lost from reduced deficiency payments will be 
made up by other features of the 1990 farm bill but not all of it 
he said 
federation president dean kleckner said last week that he wasnt 
happy with all of the farm bill but urged its adoption 
although farm program budget cuts are disproportionate and we 
accept them with great reluctance the bill will continue 
agricultural market orientation and give farmers greater planting 
flexibility he said 
 
washington ap the 1990 farm law will be a prime topic of 
discussion as the agriculture department unlimbers its annual 
outlook conference next month 
it will be the 67th usda meeting for economists farm leaders 
commodity experts and others to look at what may be forthcoming in 
the year ahead this years session is nov 2729 
the opening day will include talks by agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter and deputy secretary of state lawrence s 
eagleberger conference officials said wednesday 
they will be followed by sidney l jones assistant secretary of 
the treasury for economic policy who will present the economic 
outlook for 1991 usda officials will discuss prospects for 
farmers consumers and agricultural exports 
other firstday events will include a panel discussion on 
european and soviet union affairs 
commodity prospects and the outlook under new farm legislation 
will be highlights during the remainder of the conference along 
with environmental and energy issues 
among the forecasts will be usdas first for consumer food 
prices in 1991 and its predictions for exports and farm income 
the impact of higher oil prices will be a major factor in the 
1991 farm income forecast energy also will be important in looking 
ahead at retail food prices 
 
washington ap production of farmraised catfish dropped 9 
percent last month from a year earlier to 276 million pounds 
according to a monthly report by the agriculture department 
however the report said the average price paid by processors to 
growers in september was 78 cents per pound up 13 cents from a 
year ago 
on a cumulative basis catfish farmers delivered about 2778 
million pounds of catfish to processors through september compared 
with 2553 million pounds in the same nine months of 1989 
imports of freshwater catfish mostly from brazil are down from 
a year ago the report said imports in august the most recent 
month calculated totaled 362000 pounds down 14 percent from a

parliament on thursday 
overwhelmingly approved a law to put into private hands about 
100000 small shops and enterprises that were nationalized during 
four decades of communist rule 
the privatization process is a key part of reforms aimed at 
transforming czechoslovakias centralized economy into a 
westernstyle one guided by market mechanisms 
the law was approved by 202 of the 239 deputies present and 
voting the state ctk news agency reported 
finance minister vaclav klaus who presented the draft to the 
legislature wednesday said it was a compromise which cannot 
satisfy all completely 
the measure will apply to some 100000 shops and small 
enterprises with an overall value of about 83 million equivalent 
to nearly half the nations annual budget 
thousands of vendors across the country staged symbolic strikes 
last month demanding they be given first crack at buying the shops 
they wanted to pay up to half the purchase price in installemnts 
spread over a sevenyear period 
the vendors were afraid they would be shut out by people with 
large amounts of capital to invest foreigners or onetime 
communist functionaries who amassed fortunes under the former 
government 
although the government draft would have given employees of the 
enterprises being bought the option of installment payments over 
five years the version approved by parliament scrapped that 
provision 
auctions will be held in two rounds with the first round open 
only to czechoslovak citizens and those who emigrated after the 
communists came to power in 1948 
shops and enterprises which are not sold in the first round will 
proceed to the second in which some foreigners will also be 
allowed to bid 
the bidding will begin at prices determined by the government 
the minimum price acceptable for any shop sold is 50 percent of the 
governmentproposed amount 
if the secondround auction is attended only by czechoslovak 
citizens the minimum purchase price required will be 20 percent of 
the original amount 
the new law is to take effect on dec 1 ctk said 
privatization of large industrial plants and the agricultural 
sector is expected to begin in early 1991

a man who claimed he was suffering from 
postvietnam stress was convicted for a second time today of the 
1981 rapekidnap of a woman who went public with her ordeal after 
years of delays and a retrial 
a jury found robert percy guilty on all four counts in the 1981 
attack on sue kremelberg 
god yea kremelberg said her fists raised in the air 
after the jury read its verdict she and her family then hugged in 
the courtroom 
percy was accused of raping kremelberg in 1981 while out on bail 
after raping an essex attorney susan sweetser just weeks earlier 
in both cases percy was convicted of rape by a lower court in 
both cases the vermont supreme court sent the cases back for 
retrial the states highest court recently upheld percys second 
conviction in the sweetser case 
for 10 years the women have been forced repeatedly to return to 
a vermont courtroom to recount their ordeals and outrage over that 
experience prompted them to go public with their cases earlier this 
year 
i want people to know the outrage kremelberg said recently 
their accounts in turn have prompted calls for reforms in the 
vermont judiciary that has allowed the cases to drag on through 
trials state supreme court hearings and retrials 
vermont attorney general jeffrey amestoy in a note to sweetser 
the day the court upheld percys conviction in her case wrote 
nine years late may my daughters have your courage and may they 
have a fairer and faster criminal justice system 
percy does not deny raping kremelberg but says he was insane at 
the time suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and 
reliving a vietnam war flashback 
percys lawyer james dumont pointed in closing arguments 
wednesday to the testimony of psychiatrists which he said showed 
percy was wounded in the brain by his vietnam experience 
but prosecutor phillip cykon said percy was in control of his 
actions at the time of the attack 
the vietnam war is not on trial here cykon said 
posttramatic stress disorder alone is not enough to excuse 
criminal behavior 
kremelberg faced percy for the second time in the courtroom last 
week her voice calm but at times in tears she recounted for the 
jury her ninehour ordeal on the night of jan 16 1981 when she 
stopoped at a garage in stowe where percy was an attendant 
she testified that percy told her to back her car to the air 
pump located in a darker section of the stations lot because her 
left tire looked low she said percy then jumped into her car 
pulled out a gun and forced her to drive away she was tied up and 
raped twice before percy fled

yale university efforts with lab mice could 
lead to a vaccine against lyme disease in humans and perhaps 
against syphilis as well researchers say 
in a study to be published friday in the journal science a yale 
team reported that a lyme disease vaccine for mice was made with a 
geneengineering technique that could be applied to other diseases 
such as syphilis that are caused by a type of bacteria called 
spirochetes 
its very likely that well be able to get a good vaccine for 
humans from this technique said richard a flavell leader of 
the yale team if it works on this disease then it may be used 
to develop vaccines against other diseases with spirochetes such 
as syphilis 
a harvard researcher however said that the success of a lyme 
disease vaccine even for mice cannot be proven until the immunity 
is tested against disease in the way it is naturally spread 
through a tick bite 
david h persing of the harvard school of public health said 
that the saliva of lyme diseaseinfected ticks also contains 
substances that depress some immune functions a vaccine would be 
proven he said only when it is shown to give protection against 
the effects of these substances also 
lyme disease was first identified in 1975 and named for the 
connecticut town where a yale study was conducted the disease is 
spread by a small deer tick that passes along the spirochete when 
it sucks blood from a victim the disease can cause heart problems 
arthritislike joint pain skin rash and even brain disorders 
identified early lyme disease can be successfully treated with 
antibiotics 
flavell said that to develop the lyme disease vaccine the yale 
scientists first had to find a special inbred strain of laboratory 
mice able to contract the disease he said stephen w barthold a 
yale veterinary scientist found that a mouse strain called c3hhe 
could be infected with the lyme disease spirochete and develop 
symptoms within five days 
to make the vaccine the yale researchers cloned a gene for a 
protein called ospa that is on the surface of the lyme 
spirochete 
the gene was then spliced into a common laboratory bacteria that 
then produced the ospa protein 
a purified form of ospa was injected into a group of mice and 
tests showed that the rodents developed antibodies to the protein 
inoculated mice then were injected with the lyme spirochete 
mice that had been injected with the ospa protein did not get 
lyme disease antibodies made by the mouse immune system in 
response to the ospa protein were able to keep the bacteria in 
check other mice that had not received the ospa shots developed 
the lyme symptoms 
dr erol fikrig a member of the yale team said the study 
required injecting the bacteria because the researchers had to know 
exactly how much spirochete each mouse received using a tick to 
spread the disease he said would be highly variable and could 
not be reproduced precisely 
fikrig acknowledged that the laboratory test of the vaccine is 
not a true test of its effectiveness against the tickborn disease 
in nature things could be different and further studies on 
that will have to be done he said 
the importance of the study he said is that some immune 
protection was demonstrated against a spirochete bacteria 
the fact that we can make a vaccine against this organism is 
certainly encouraging that vaccines against other spirochete 
illnesses can be developed as well and that includes syphilis 
said fikrig 
flavell said it will take five to eight years of additional 
laboratory work before the experimental lyme disease vaccine can be 
tried on humans 
science which is publishing the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

nearly 3800 rare books and historic 
documents have vanished from the wroclaw university library 
apparently sold abroad under the guise of academic exchanges a 
newspaper reported thursday 
the thefts were discovered early this year by german researchers 
working on the collection that came into polish hands when the 
german city of breslau became the polish city of wroclaw at the end 
of world war ii 
government auditors and the prosecutors office have launched an 
investigation and asked the university rector for disciplinary 
proceedings against library employees as well as to start putting 
the collection in order according to the gazeta wyborcza 
newspaper 
the library houses one of europes largest collections of books 
from the middle ages among its 15 million volumes the newspaper 
said 
auditors said the thefts occurred even after they started their 
inspection of the library 
investigators concluded that traditional interlibrary exchanges 
of books between universities for academic research were being 
exploited for commercial purposes according to gazeta wyborcza 
between 1986 and june 1990 3793 manuscripts were sent abroad 
and sold without appropriate permission the newspaper said 
it said it was impossible to determine the prices the documents 
sold for because the dealings were not recorded by the university 
accounting office 
the customs declarations offer few clues because in 860 cases 
they state the materials were being exported for free exchange and 
did not have cultural value according to the report 
poland has strict laws about exporting pre1945 antiques 
artwork and other items designed to protect the countrys cultural 
heritage 
other investigations have shown however that loose controls on 
museums the financially beleaguered state of cultural 
institutions and abuses by authorities led to the disappearance of 
many treasures from national art and museum collections during the 
communist regime 
the government auditing bureau also suggested the collection was 
not properly cared for because it wasnt polish 
the essential reason for this negligence is an inappropriate 
approach to formerly german collections by both employees of the 
library and the scientific staff of the university the auditing 
bureau said

the latest medical technology lets women turn back 
their biological clocks and get pregnant after menopause but also 
raises questions about how old is too old for child rearing 
doctors say they can extend womens babymaking years well into 
their 40s 50s and perhaps 60s providing a second chance for those 
who waited too long to start families however some doctors have 
doubts about the wisdom of childbearing for those who are well past 
natures own cutoff 
because we can do something technically does not mean we 
should do it indiscriminately said dr zev rosenwaks the 
ability to become pregnant is a physical sign of what nature itself 
expects of a woman you cannot push nature past the point where you 
interfere with safety 
rosenwaks is head of the fertility clinic at new york 
hospitalcornell medical center one of several hospitals around 
the country that has begun using the new technology 
the process described in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine is a variation on the nowroutine process of in vitro 
fertilization conception in the lab dish ordinarily doctors 
remove eggs from an infertile womans ovaries mix them with sperm 
and then put the embryos into her womb 
however this is not possible if the womans ovaries have 
stopped working the change of life known as menopause until 
recently that was the end of the reproductive line for women 
but now doctors are removing eggs from healthy young donors and 
implanting them in older women after they have been fertilized with 
sperm because the mother does not provide the egg she is not the 
genetic parent of her baby but still undergoes a normal pregnancy 
and delivery 
the major limits to the technique are the health of the mother 
and the cost 8000 for each attempt plus a 1500 payment to the 
egg donor 
in the journal dr mark v sauer of the university of southern 
california described the use of the technique on seven women over 
40 whose ovaries didnt last as long as their desire to have 
babies 
menopause usually occurs around age 50 but in about 10 percent 
of women the ovaries stop working by age 40 sometimes these women 
have delayed having children often while they establish their 
careers 
many women are coming in 40 years of age or older they have 
an air of desperation its their last chance said dr anne 
wentz who has a geriatric infertility practice at northwestern 
university 
pregnancy is riskier for older women than young ones they are 
more likely to have high blood pressure premature labor and 
bleeding wentz and others noted that there is simply no way to 
know the effects of carrying and delivering a child on a women in 
her 50s and beyond 
we dont have any data on that it opens up a pandoras box 
said dr steven bayer of new england medical center 
others noted that older women should carefully think about 
whether they have the stamina to deal with 2 am feedings and 
other rigors of bringing up babies 
there is concern about progressively older individuals trying 
to provide parenting for an infant and a child as it grows up 
said dr machelle seibel of faulkner hospital in boston i have 
no right to say what is the right age but at some point there has 
to be limits to what age is appropriate 
dr kamren moghissi of wayne state university added some of 
them wont live to see their kids get married or even graduate from 
college the natural lifespan for women is around 80 years but 
some women die at age 60 or 65 these women obviously wont see 
their children grow up 
while the image of the ticking biological clock became a 
familiar one for young professional women in the last decade there 
is some evidence of a reversal in the popularity of postponement of 
childbearing for a career 
a time magazine poll of 505 americans ages 1824 taken last 
month by yankelovich clancy shulman found 51 percent put having a 
long and happy marriage and raising welladjusted children ahead of 
career success

congressional leaders in virtual agreement on 
major tax issues sought spending compromises today as they neared 
completion of a deficitreduction plan that has the tentative 
support of a majority of lawmakers and president bush 
however despite the apparent agreement republicans today were 
emphasizing remaining differences among negotiators 
theres nothing the president has signed off on yet its not 
just one issue there must be two dozen important issues that 
havent been resolved senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
said after an afternoon white house meeting 
still rep silvio conte rmass declared do not despair 
the end is in sight as the house and senate inched toward final 
adjournment of the 101st congress 
bush who averted a partial shutdown of the government by 
signing a temporary spending measure to keep operations going until 
midnight saturday said it was time to get the budget crisis 
behind us 
at a rose garden picturetaking session with gop leaders 
designed to try to show resurrected gop unity bush said he was now 
ready to turn his full attention to campaigning for gop candidates 
we are totally committed in our determination to send a sound 
strong republican message across this country bush said weve 
been bludgeoned by a bunch of demagogic attacks by the democrats 
for months bush said 
but even that unity seemed fragile 
rep newt gingrich rga who abandoned bush on the original 
budget agreement was invited to the unity session but still 
refused to pledge support for the emerging package 
since the plan doesnt exist despite your myopic focus on it 
i dont think any of us have an obligation to tell you in advance 
what we would do in terms of voting for the package gingrich 
told reporters 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was satisfied 
with the overall final package that was emerging although there 
were still some details to be worked out 
there have been compromises on both sides fitzwater said 
noting that the package meets bushs overall goal of a 
500billion fiveyear budget package 
a senior administration official briefing a group of reporters 
on the condition of anonymity said bush expected wide bipartisan 
support in both chambers for the budget deal 
assuming no unexpected hitch final votes on the 
deficitreduction package could come friday in the house and 
senate that would close another chapter in a longrunning fight 
between the executive and legislative branches and remove the major 
obstacle to adjournment barely a week before the nov 6 
elections 
we still have a lot of work to do sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee told reporters 
as leaders began another series of closed meetings to work out the 
budget plan 
the plan will mean higher taxes on tobacco alcoholic beverages 
airline tickets cars boats furs and jewelry a gasoline tax 
increase of 5 or 6 cents a gallon is likely and retirees probably 
will have to pay more for medicare coverage 
several changes whose details were still being negotiated will 
mean heftier income taxes on those with higher incomes especially 
those above the 100000ayear range but a provision that would 
have raised taxes on lowerand middleincome americans by forgoing 
next years scheduled inflation adjustment in income taxes was 
dropped 
leaders of both parties embraced broad outlines of the 
deficitreduction compromise wednesday after democrats dropped 
demands that it include a special surtax on the rich 
negotiators said sizable problems remained to be worked out on 
spending for medicare medicaid and farm programs 
the talks have produced preliminary agreement on major tax 
issues ncluding 
raising the top tax rate on the wealthiest people to 31 percent 
from the present 28 percent the 33 percent rate paid by 
uppermiddleincome people on some of their earnings would drop to 
31 percent 
phasing out the 2050 personal exemptions for single people 
with taxable incomes over 100000 and couples above 150000 
permitting writing off only 97 percent of otherwise allowable 
deductions against any portion of adjusted gross income over 
100000 a year 
setting a maximum tax rate of 28 percent on capital gains 
which are profits from the sale of investments that would mean a 
tax cut for those whose gains are now taxed at 33 percent but would 
fall far short of the general capitalgains tax cut that bush has 
demanded 
the bill that contains tax increases and restraints on medicare 
and other mandatory spending would cut the deficit by about 250 
billion over the next five years another 250 billion would come 
principally from scaling back military spending and cutting 
interest expenses by reducing government borrowing 
even with that package government spending is expected to total 
12 trillion during the 12 months that end next sept 30 and the 
deficit still would be a record 250 billion the bill envisions 
that todays federal debt of 3 trillionplus will soar to 5 
trillion by the end of the fiveyear period 
the emerging compromise has bipartisan support in the senate and 
backing from a clear majority of house democrats however 
votecounters ay house republican leader robert michel of illinois 
will be lucky to get 50 of the 176 gop members behind the plan 
despite bushs pleas most house republicans adamantly oppose any 
tax increase

three recently promoted police sergeants 
have lost their stripes because they failed to shed their flab and 
the fraternal order of police is fighting mad 
ive got 26 years on the job and since i got out of the 
academy nobodys checked my weight to see if i ate too many 
doughnuts fop president john shaw complained 
stephen guckin joseph mcgoldrick and john j harkins became 
sergeants in april after passing oral and written tests but they 
also signed agreements with the city to meet weight limits 
when the deadline came last week they hadnt made their weight 
objectives they were demoted to the rank of officer 
city officials said pay varies according to an individuals 
merit raises and other factors but that the demotions meant the 
three men probably went from about 34380 a year down to around 
31500 
the city was sympathetic but firm about standards that had been 
loosely applied for years 
nobody wants to penalize people who are on a promotional 
list said ralph j teti the chief deputy city solicitor 
theyve shown they have some qualities of leadership but you 
dont want to do anything thats going to endanger them either 
some police who were ordered to get rid of the pounds succeeded 
a new lieutenant two corporals and a detective met their goals 
another detective told to lose 46 pounds got rid of only 35 but 
kept his promotion because of the progress he had made 
guckin was told to lose 40 pounds and only lost 20 mcgoldrick 
was expected to lose 28 pounds and didnt lose any and harkins 
promised to lose 100 pounds and only dropped two 
guckin said he had lost nearly 50 pounds before his promotion 
getting his weight down to 280 pounds although it was a struggle 
to lose 20 more pounds since then he said he hopes to lose 20 
more 
mcgoldrick 41 a nineyear veteran of the force weighed 291 
pounds last week harkins 37 a 16year veteran weighed 313 
according to city officials 
the police department doesnt require routine physical 
examinations but teti said it eventually hopes to do so once or 
twice a year 
the weight standards have been in effect for at least 15 years 
teti said although police currently undergo medical tests only 
when they are hired or promoted or when they return to duty after 
long leaves 
teti said the citys weight standards are based on tables 
developed by life insurance companies rookies have to be within 20 
percent of their ideal weight veterans must be within 30 percent 
for example the guidelines allow a 6foot male veteran to weigh 
up to 244 pounds and a 5foot6 female veteran to weigh 207 pounds 
shaw still thought the program was unrealistic 
you cant walk over to a cop and say youre being promoted 
to sergeant and by the way you have to loose 80 pounds i know 
people do it on tv but that doesnt make it right or good for your 
health he said tuesday 
guckin 31 said he was surprised to learn about the weight 
requirement last spring 
these promotions are not handed to you he said ten years 
ago they hired me at one weight now they expect me to be less than 
that because i got promoted 
teti said the police department agreed to put the three 
policemen back at the top of its list for promotions and they will 
have a shot at the next openings for sergeant 
provided they make the weight minimums he said

a rightwing coalition scored a 
landslide victory over ousted prime minister benazir bhutto on 
thursday and urged her to be a good loser and accept defeat ms 
bhutto said shell go to court 
ms bhutto ejected from office aug 6 on corruption and 
mismanagement charges refused to concede wednesdays parliamentary 
election and accused the armybacked caretaker government of 
massive voterigging 
a group of 40 international poll watchers refused to comment on 
the allegations but was expected to discuss its preliminary 
findings friday in karachi 
the groups assessment could affect hundreds of millions of 
dollars in us aid to pakistan the united states and other 
western countries have threatened to cut off aid if the elections 
were rigged 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the united states looks forward to working with any pakistani 
government elected in a free and fair election but it was 
reserving judgment on the results 
some poll watchers said privately they were suspicious of some 
constituencies where they witnessed a low voter turnout yet the 
final count showed tens of thousands had marked their ballot but 
they said largescale vote fraud will be difficult to prove 
i can assure you the election has not been rigged caretaker 
prime minister ghulam mustafa jatoi told a news conference the 
people have given their mandate their verdict she should accept 
the results and prove to the world that shes a democrat 
ms bhutto said she would challenge the election results in 
court rather than call street demonstrations 
the peoples party candidates who lost because of rigged 
election will challenge the results in court ms bhutto 37 
said after returning to her hometown of karachi on thursday night 
most political analysts foreign diplomats and opinion polls 
predicted a close race between ms bhuttos leftleaning pakistan 
peoples party and the rightwing islamic democratic alliance for 
control of the 217member national assembly the policymaking 
lower house of parliament that chooses the prime minister 
but the final vote count completed almost 24 hours after the 
polls closed showed ms bhuttos opponents had delivered a 
stunning upset that surpassed even their expectations 
ms bhuttos peoples party and its smaller allies won only 45 
seats the islamic democratic alliance a looseknit coalition of 
18 diverse parties united by their contempt for ms bhutto emerged 
with 105 seats 
voting was delayed in one constituency because of a candidates 
death the rest of the seats went to smaller ethnic and religious 
partiies and independents 
most seemed at a loss to explain ms bhuttos dismal showing 
some blamed poor voter turnout estimated at about 35 percent 
theres a growing sense of apathy and cynicism about the whole 
democratic process in pakistan one western diplomat said on 
condition of anonymity after watching repeated governments swept 
aside either by the military or by the constitution people are 
beginning to ask why bother to vote 
pakistan has been ruled by four military dictators since its 
creation as a moslem homeland in the 1947 partition that ended 
british colonial rule of the subcontinent 
ms bhutto alleged she lost because of rigging in at least 80 
constituencies she accused the caretaker government of stuffing 
and stealing ballot boxes and intimidating and harrassing voters to 
keep them away from polling booths 
jatoi replied the country cannot depend on the whims and 
fantasies of a young lady as attractive as she may be especially 
with the foreign press the country has to move forward 
the winning alliances first test will come saturday when voters 
return to the polls to elect legislative assemblies in pakistans 
four provinces ms bhutto has said her party will contest the 
elections 
the alliances victory likely puts pakistan on a more 
conservative islamic course 
the alliance espouses adherence to the tents of islam prompting 
speculation it could tigthen control on the media and restrict the 
rights of women and nonmoslems it also favors a closer 
relationship with the islamic world and more independence from the 
west especially the united states 
according to pakistans constitution power must be transferred 
from the caretaker government to the new government within 30 days 
the next prime minister will be elected by secret ballot when the 
national assembly is called to session 
party sources say pakistans next premier would likely be nawaz 
sharif the alliance leader and former chief minister of eastern 
punjab province where 60 percent of pakistans 110 million people 
live 
alliance leaders have said the new government will continue the 
caretaker governments investigation of corruption by ms bhuttos 
government 
the caretaker government has charged ms bhutto with seven 
counts of abuse of power and had her husband jailed on charges of 
kidnapping and extortion she says the charges are baseless

a roman catholic man said 
thursday that he thought he was driving to his death when ira 
gunmen strapped him into a van loaded with explosives and tailed 
him to a military base 
this is it he recalled thinking 
but gerry kelly was lucky he wriggled free and the bomb failed 
to go off 
similar bombladen vehicles which the irish republican army 
forced two other men to drive exploded early wednesday at two army 
border checkpoints in londonderry and newry killing six soldiers 
and one of the drivers 
it was the deadliest ira onslaught in the province in two years 
the ira said the drivers were collaborators who had done 
construction work for the security forces 
kelly said ira gunmen came to his house held his family 
hostage took his van and filled it with explosives they then 
strapped him in the seat and ordered him to drive to the sherwood 
foresters base at lisanelly near omagh 55 miles west of belfast 
where he is a mechanic kelly said 
he said one of the men told him im putting a 40minute timer 
on so youve got plenty of time 
they said dont do anything stupid we have a rifle trained 
on you 
it was a terrible ordeal kelly said i just kept thinking 
about my family and what would happen to them the sweat was 
dribbling down my face all sorts of things were going through my 
mind and i thought this was it 
as he drove through the gates he said i shouted bombs i 
got myself out of the rope 
they told me that the rope was there to make sure i didnt 
jump out and that when i arrived at the camp the brits would loosen 
it and let me out 
i was tied round my waist i didnt really know why they did 
it but i was absolutely terrified 
dozens of local residents some in tears laid flowers thursday 
in the debris of an army checkpoint outside londonderry northern 
irelands second city 65 miles northwest of belfast 
five soldiers and driver patsy gillespie were killed when his

a heathrow airport security officer 
said thursday he received no warning about a bomb threat to pan am 
flight 103 which exploded over lockerbie scotland in 1988 
killing 270 people 
there were no instructions to be on the lookout for a toshiba 
radio cassette recorder among passengers baggage sulkash kumar 
kamboj told a public inquiry into the terrorist bombing the bomb 
that blew up the plane was inside a toshiba cassette recorder 
packed in a suitcase 
kamboj said security staff were told to always check carefully 
any items of electrical equipment among the luggage but he said 
his employers alert security had given him no specific warning to 
look out for the toshiba machine 
he said he knew nothing about the socalled helsinki warning 
of a bomb threat to a pan am flight the us embassy in helsinki 
finland received a telephone warning that there would be a bombing 
attack on a pan am flight from frankfurt to new york around 
christmas but the warning was not made public 
pan american world airways flight 103 originated in frankfurt on 
a boeing 727 but switched to a larger boeing 747 at heathrow for 
the flight to new york 
kamboj said he was working a 12hour day on dec 21 1988 he 
checked passengers luggage being transferred to pan am jets from 
feeder flights at heathrows terminal 3 
all bags transferred from other airlines flights to pan am 
flight 103 passed through an xray machine and he paid particular 
attention to any electrical items but the outline of a 
radiocassette player did not cause special concern among so many 
electrical items kamboj said 
the inquiry heard earlier this week that baggage transferred 
from pan am flights including luggage from frankfurt was not 
screened before being loaded onto the plane scottish police have 
said they believe the bag with the cassette recorder bomb inside 
was put on the plane in frankfurt 
kamboj said no one can recognize every single thing in the 
bags it is impossible to be right 100 percent of the time 
he said he received one day of training when he joined alert 
security 3 years ago the training has been increased to an 
eightday course since the disaster the inquiry was told 
there also have been changes to the security system including 
the introduction of a color xray monitor 
the public inquiry is focusing on the deaths of the 259 people 
aboard the plane and 11 on the ground and how to prevent a 
repetition of the disaster but is not considering criminal 
responsibility 
scottish authorities have said they are investigating several 
radical palestinian groups

for seasoned lawmakers congress final rush 
to adjournment is a window of opportunity for their legislative 
priorities 
there are some members of both the house and senate who 
operate best at midnight when they can do their legislative 
slamdunks with the public looking the other way said rep pat 
williams dmont 
for sen lloyd bentsen dtexas its a chance to win some 
longsought incentives for oil exploration sen jesse helms 
rnc quietly won senate approval of an amendment restricting 
grants by the national endowment for the arts 
others insert provisions into bills for new projects back home 
there wont be time enough for opponents to quibble but enough 
time to brag just before the election 
but not everyone gets to cash in for some the end game is a 
time of pain when the rankandfile lawmaker gets run over 
even as somebody is amputating our legs theyre also pulling 
out our fingernails said rep jack buechner rmo the longer 
were up here the more were going to get rolled 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash described it as a 
natural tendency to negotiate up to the point of the absolute 
running out of time 
but congress is running out of time this year lke never before 
staying in session with less than two weeks before the election 
it happens every congress bills that have been stacking up for 
two years suddenly must get passed now or die 
an amazing number dozens and dozens rocket through the house 
and the senate in the final days on thursday the house approved a 
268 billion pentagon spending compromise in 11 minutes 
congress closing agenda this year includes everything from fish 
inspection to clean air from raising taxes to declaring statue of 
liberty day 
some such as clean air remain individual bills but others 
such as child care get amalgamated into huge legislative packages 
both are examples of brinksmanship 
the childcare bill a longargued piece of legislation was 
practically given up for dead until the end game gave it new 
life 
sen christopher dodd dconn its prime senate sponsor said 
he had only intended a bluff when he threatened to offer his 
version as an amendment to the already huge budget bill thats been 
crawling through congress 
suddenly with the elections around the corner the white house 
wanted to negotiate 
all i know is that friday evening for the first time in four 
years we had an offer to sit down and talk dodd said 
a deal was reached in three days and the package is expected to 
pass along with the budget 
the clean air bill the first major revision of the air 
pollution law since the 1970s was one of the goals the democratic 
leadership and president bush listed when the 101st congress began 
in january 1989 
but the legislation moved from one gridlock to another until 
finally with time running out a compromise was forced 
senate majority leader george mitchell said thursday he expected 
final house and senate action before adjournment 
some members doubt that the final rush produces good 
legislation 
rep henry waxman dcalif is a regular participant in the end 
game because as a champion of the big medicare and medicaid health 
programs he inevitably becomes entwined in lastminute 
budgetcutting talks 
were always dragged in the politics of the budget is driving 
health care policy he said its not a rational way to make 
decisions

scandinavians chained themselves to 
soviet border posts and nordic politicians expressed surprise 
thursday over a soviet nuclear test on the arctic islands of novaya 
zemlya 
a lastminute appeal to moscow by prime minister jan p syse of 
norway failed to halt the test and finnish officials ordered an 
investigation into the effects of the blast about 370 miles from 
the norwegian border 
the soviet nuclear explosion wednesday afternoon came only days 
after soviet officials denied such tests would be carried out 
the soviet embassy informed norwegian officials earlier 
wednesday about a test in the immediate future according to 
syses office in oslo the soviets had invited norwegian government 
environmentalists to check the test site earlier in the week 
we strongly disapprove of what the neighboring state now has 
done syse told the national news agency ntb 
protesters chained themselves to a norwegian boom at a border 
post to the soviet union and chanted novoya semlya nyet as a 
soviet delegation crossed to celebrate the 46th anniversary of the 
areas liberation from nazi occupation 
a former norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland who 
heads the united nations commission on the environment and 
development condemned the test 
the soviet test blast spreads negative reaction and fear 
especially in north norway brundtland said 
however both finnish and norwegian nuclear experts said there 
was little to fear from the tests they said no increased radiation 
had been detected in northern scandinavia 
the finnish foreign ministry said the nordic countries will 
jointly demand an end to all global undergound nuclear tests 
the finnish environment minister kaj barlund said he would 
discuss the issue with his soviet counterpart nikolai voronchov 
at a meeting of environment ministers in helsinki next week 
the test came as a complete surprise to us i am extremely 
concerned about it and will demand more information from my soviet 
colleague barlund said in a telephone interview 
barlund said a factfinding committee had been ordered to study 
the possible danger of the explosion to finland and would try to 
visit the soviet test site in the barents sea 
we dont know whether this is a oneoff test or the beginning 
of a series but in any case such tests are very harmful to the 
extremely vulnerable arctic environment barlund said 
in a live broadcast on national finnish radio on saturday 
soviet officials had denied the soviet union planned tests on the 
islands 
these days we are not conducting underground explosions on 
novaya zemlya and such explosions will not be continued by the 
ussr andrei salatkyov a soviet parliamentiarian said in the 
broadcast 
the swedish government expressed regret over the resumption of 
soviet nuclear testing in the arctic 
this awakes a deep and justified concern in sweden and many 
other countries said swedens foreign minister sten andersson 
he said soviet embassy officials had been summoned to the foreign 
ministry to be told of his governments concern 
earlier this year the nordic countries jointly appealed to the 
soviet union not to resume nuclear testing on novaya zemlya after a 
twoyear interruption 
the environmental groups greenpeace and bellona have warned that 
the soviets planned to resume nuclear testing on the islands and 
sent two ships there earlier this month and in september both were 
intercepted by the soviet coast guard 
the islands were a primary soviet nuclear test site from 
19581963

fiftyfifty 
the egyptian president visited saudi arabia the united arab

as well as to provide medicine infant food and spare parts to fix 
some orphanages outoforder heating systems the commission said 
in a statement 
the ec also said it will send an engineer to romania this week 
to assess the need for heating equipment that cannot be bought 
locally 
the funds announced thursday are in addition to 36 million the 
ec granted to nongovernment agencies recently to help care for the 
romanian orphans many of whom are suffering from aids through use 
of infected needles needles have been in chronic short supply in 
romania hence some needles were overused 
the plight of orphans in romania is a legacy of the regime of 
nicolae ceauscescu the former dictator who was executed last 
december 
the commission said it planned another grant of almost 9 
million for additional supplies of infant foods at the request 
of romanias ministry of health 
ec external relations commissioner frans andriessen in a letter

the us rift with israel over jerusalem tests 
the bush administrations skill in shielding its middle eastern 
ally from tougher measures in the united nations and in keeping 
flickering hopes for peace talks alive 
us officials said thursday they had no intention of seeking 
new resolutions in the security council attacking israel their 
hope is the furor over israels refusal to cooperate with an 
investigation into the slaying of 19 palestinian arabs will subside 
in a few days 
but secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said unless israel 
changed its mind his report would deal with ways of protecting 
palestinians and british ambassador david hannay who is presiding 
over the council this month said israels treatment of 
palestinians is not going to go away from the council agenda 
 
that portends a un foot in the door that israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir feared and prompted the israeli cabinet to 
refuse to cooperate with the un investigation 
the us vote to deplore israels decision along with a us 
vote two weeks ago to condemn israel for the shootings shatters 
the assumption the united states nearly always stands by its friend 
in the usually hostile united nations 
this could whet the appetite of israels enemies to keep up the 
pressure while diverting the bush administration from its goal of 
refocusing attention on iraqs occupation of kuwait 
the united states and israel used to agree that the un was a 
hostile place that is no longer the case as a result of the end of 
the cold war and now the iraqi aggression said martin indyk 
director of the washington institute for near east policy the 
united states has increasingly turned to the un as the mechanism 
for promoting a new world order while for israel it remains a very 
hostile place 
moreover indyk said thursday that the united states will 
constantly have to decide with every new resolution whether its 
going to isolate itself or condemn israel again this hastens the 
day when either there will be sanctions against israel or the 
united states will have to use its veto so its a nowin situation 
for the united states 
in fact avi pazner spokesman for israeli prime minister 
shamir said thursday that the unanimous resolution helps saddam 
hussenn to distract attention from what is happening in the gulf 
but richard w murphy a former assistant secretary of state for 
the near east faults israel for mishandling the dispute at a 
hell of an unfortunate time and sees at least one boost for iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
hes able to say see thats exactly what ive been saying 
all along follow me and well do something about the palestinian 
issue murphy a senior fellow at the council on foreign 
relations said thursday 
william b quandt who ran the middle east desk at the national 
security council for thenpresident carter says it will be 
difficult for the bush administration to get the focus back on iraq 
at the united nations 
there are pressures in the un largely from the arab group 
and also the third world to bargain over un resolutions to try 
to trade support for us resolutions on the persian gulf for us 
support on arabisraeli issues quandt said thursday 
and yet for the foreseeable future the gulf is so much the 
dominant issue that there is no desire to dwell on this 
difference and its real with israel said quandt who is a 
senior fellow at the brookings institution 
conveniently perhaps next month is the united states turn to 
preside over the security council this could facilitate action on 
a series of resolutions against iraq including a proposal by prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain that saddam hussein be forced 
to pay reparations for the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the israeli cabinets decision and shamirs refusal to reverse 
it is the latest in a string of disagreements with the bush 
administration 
the president has referred to east jerusalem as occupied 
territory thereby suggesting he considers israels control over 
part of its capital illegitimate 
israels settlement of some soviet jewish refugees in east 
jerusalem the west bank and gaza is another sore point 
the bush administration considers settlements of soviet refugees 
or any other jews in the territories an obstacle to peace because 
the arabs hope to recapture the lands they lost in the 1967 mideast 
war 
like its predecessors the administration also is committed to 
urging israel to give up most if not all of the territory in 
exchange for arab acceptance of the jewish state 
david scheffer an international lawyer who is with the carnegie 
endowment for international peace says israel could have admitted 
the un investigators without conceding its claim of sovereignty 
over east jerusalem 
i do not consider it to be giving the un some extraordinary 
foothold in jerusalem he said there are un observers in 
jerusalem the un is already there 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii and others in 
the administration who would like to see israel negotiate with 
palestinians arabs will try to repair the rift before it destroys 
any chance for getting israelipalestinian talks started 
but israel which has depended on us support in a world 
organization largely hostile to the jewish state is bound to feel 
even more anxious about risking negotiations with only the bush 
administration for protection 
does it leave scars exdiplomat murphy said of the two 
us votes against israel probably yes both sides think the 
other is unreasonable 
but asked if the rift derails mideast peace talks murphy 
replied you dont derail something that isnt on the tracks yet 
in fact the tracks arent there yet

barring the outbreak of war in the persian 
gulf gasoline prices will hover between 130 and 162 per gallon 
over the next year an administration energy expert told a senate 
panel thursday 
the forecast came in the opening session of a threeday hearing 
on why oil prices shoot up on the slightest rumor of trouble in the 
mideast but dont seem to come down on rumors of peace 
us energy information administrator calvin kent also predicted 
that home heating oil would cost between 113 and 145 per gallon 
through 1991 roughly equal to the high levels heating oil reached 
in last winters cold snap 
an improvement in the mideast situation might lower the price of 
crude oil but dont look for an immediate response at the pump 
kent told the senate committee on governmental affairs 
prices go up more quickly than they come down kent said 
the price estimates assume that the persian gulf crisis does not 
dissolve into war that the winter is normal in severity and that 
market factors such as inventories and daily oil production remain 
relatively stable 
also assumed in kents forecast was that crude oil remains at 
about 30 per barrel that assumption seemed open to question even 
as he testified in new yorks mercantile exchange oil jumped 317 
per barrel in early trading to 3425 by mid day 
members of the senate panel focused on the volatility of the oil 
market committee chairman john glenn dohio scoffed at how 
some goofy thing like a rumor about saddam hussein having a 
dream can affect oil prices 
the reference was to a report in an iraqi newspaper that hussein 
had a dream that his guns were aimed at the wrong enemy even the 
mere suggestion that tensions with the united states might be 
reduced was enough to cause crude oil prices to drop 
in the past few days though crude prices have increased as 
hopes for a compromise to end the gulf standoff waned the reason 
for price volatility kent said is that other mideast countries 
like saudi arabia are pumping out extra oil to make up for the loss 
of kuwaiti and iraqi oil further trouble in the mideast could 
interrupt that flow 
the vast amount of replacement oil is coming from the gulf and 
the vast majority of that is coming from saudi arabia kent said 
rumors of war make the market extremely nervous and thats why 
you see these jumps of 2 and 3 in the price based on fairly 
trivial rumors 
american petroleum institute president charles dibona told the 
committee that oil industries have shown considerable restraint 
in holding back on price increases at the pump between aug 2 and 
the end of september he said the spot price on crude oil rose 44 
cents per gallon while gasoline went up at the pump by only 24 
cents 
department of energy statistics submitted to the committee 
indicate that heating oil customers have felt the gulf crisis more 
directly oil companies have passed on 90 percent of the crude 
price increase to consumers of home heating oil

a jury thursday convicted a state lawmaker 
of selling his vote for parimutuel betting for 4300 ending the 
first trial stemming from an fbi undercover sting labeled 
operation lost trust 
the sting so far has resulted in indictments charging 10 
legislators with bribery four have resigned their seats and 
pleaded guilty one of the 10 lawmakers pleaded guilty to drug 
charges earlier this month as did a lobbyist 
the us district court jury convicted state rep luther taylor 
a 40yearold democrat from columbia on all six counts against him 
of violating the hobbs act a federal antibribery law an 
indictment accused him of accepting five separate bribes and with 
conspiring to solicit those bribes in exchange for his support of a 
parimutuel betting bill 
taylor voted for the bill in committee during this past 
legislative session the bill never made it to the state house or 
senate 
the conviction carries a maximum penalty of 120 years in prison 
and a 15 million fine no sentencing date was set 
the jury reached its verdict after about six hours of 
deliberation that followed a 10day trial 
videotapes and lobbyist ron cobb dominated the prosecutions 
case cobb a former democratic house member who had become a 
lobbyist testified that he worked undercover for the fbi after 
getting caught trying to buy cocaine from federal agents 
cobb testified he had bribed taylor with 2500 to help recruit 
other lawmakers to support the parimutuel measure which would 
have allowed voters to decide whether to allow betting on horse and 
dog racing in south carolina 
videotapes showed cobb giving an appreciative taylor the cash 
taylor maintained throughout his testimony that cobb was giving 
him campaign contributions 
but under crossexamination taylor admitted that during a 
january meeting he slipped cobb a note saying for my undivided 
attention 2500 
cobb has been granted immunity another lobbyist james brown 
pleaded guilty to marijuana possession this month in a separate 
case stemming from operation lost trust 
during closing arguments wednesday assistant us attorney dale 
dutremble reminded jurors of the potential impact of their decision 
at the statehouse and around south carolina he said a guilty 
verdict would deter corruption 
how long can you allow people like luther taylor to sell out 
how long can you allow south carolina to be disgraced youre 
entitled to better dutremble said its time for you to send a 
message to the luther taylors of our general assembly 
his office of public trust was for sale dutremble said 
defense attorney joel collins attacked the credibility of 
government witnesses especially cobb 
that ought to bother you that they ought to choose this kind 
of guy collins said 
collins argued four separate defenses to the jury that taylor 
had no intent to break the law that he made a good faith 
effort to obey the law that he did not violate the federal 
antibribery law because he consistently supported the parimutuel 
measure and that his actions could have no effect on interstate 
commerce a required element for a conviction under the law taylor 
was accused of violating 
each one of those defenses should cause the jury to have a 
reasonable doubt that taylor committed the crimes collins 
said 
he said jurors didnt need to convict taylor in order to send a 
message to the statehouse 
if the jury brought back an innocent verdict the message 
wouldnt be we tolerate sleazy legislators the message would be 
dont bring dope dealers in here and expect us to believe them 
beyond a reasonable doubt 
us attorney bart daniel got the last word in the prosecutions 
rebuttal 
he reminded the jury that taylor admitted having more 
enthusiasm for the parimutuel betting bill after he got 2500 
from cobb 
can you imagine a public official testifying on the stand that 
he could be more enthusiastic for 2500 or 500 or 300

if dan coats is still a senator in 2004 he 
says he will not seek another term 
coats appointed us senator in december 1988 is pledging he 
will step down after two full elected terms in the senate 
i think it is appropriate that someone who believes term 
limitation is best for the system really ought to practice what he 
preaches coats said 
a bill coats introduced as a house member nearly 10 years ago 
would have limited congressmen to 12 years in the house and 12 in 
the senate 
that bill failed 
coats democratic opponent baron hill has proposed a twoterm 
limit on service in the senate that would be in effect until 
congress balances the budget

did president bush squander a rare 80 percent 
approval rating in a series of missteps and errors on taxes and the 
budget 
critics suggest he did but you wouldnt know it from listening 
to white house officials they say the president is bruised but 
undaunted and knew all along his ratings in the polls would 
plunge 
before the ink was even applied to the new budget agreement the 
white house was trying thursday to mend fences and salvage what it 
could of bushs sagging popularity 
speaking for myself i want to see this budget matter behind 
us bush said at a hastily assembled group photograph in the rose 
garden orchestrated to telegraph a gop unity that in reality 
doesnt exist 
tired of fighting with other republicans the president is 
prepared to hit the campaign trail again to beat up on democrats 
that was the strategy the white house was trying to sell 
thursday as bush prepared to leave town for a fourday trip to 
speak for republican candidates forget about the budget focus on 
other areas where republicans dont agree with democrats the 
message went out 
and the charge was led by bush himself 
weve been bludgeoned by a bunch of demagogic attacks by the 
democrats for months and ive been relatively sanguine in the face 
of that because weve been trying to get something done bush 
said at the rose garden event 
but as soon as we get this done finished i will then be free 
as will everybody here thats been working on this to have our 
say bush declared 
but the picture of gop unity that the white house carefully 
sought to paint didnt take long to smear 
by the time rep newt gingrich walked the 100 yards from the 
rose garden to the battery of microphones in the white house 
driveway he was again airing his differences with the president on 
the budget 
gingrich who opposed the first budget agreement signed off on 
by the president grumbled that the deal still had not been made 
final 
since the plan doesnt exist i dont think any of us have 
an obligation to tell you in advance what we would do in terms of 
supporting it gingrich said 
bush who earlier this year had one of the highest approval 
ratings ever in public opinion polls saw his acceptance go into a 
near freefall over what many critics see as a series of 
miscalculations and mixed signals on the budget 
and in the end bush ended up backing a package that included 
more than 150 billion in new taxes over five years a far cry 
from the no new taxes pledge of his 1988 campaign 
still a senior administration official who briefed a group of 
reporters at the white house on the condition of anonymity said 
that bush went into this knowing full well and good he was 
spending political capital 
none of what has happened is a complete surprise the details 
of who did what to whom were not predictable but the fact that 
there would be this kind of a rocky road was certainly well 
anticipated the official said 
when he started this six months ago talked to economists 
about how important it was to get a package like this we talked at 
length about how he was going to have to invest his political 
capital the official continued 
he knew there would be a big political hit and a big personal 
hit on him he could have drawn half of the political cartoons 
himself theres no naivete in all of that but thats the thing he 
felt he had to 
furthermore the official claimed bushs approval ratings in 
the latest polls hovering around 55 percent may be way down 
from 80 percent but he is probably in a better position going 
into a midterm election than most previous presidents 
with all the erosion of support his numbers are still probably 
fine and hes going to use that to his benefit the official 
said 
one additional sign of white house determination to cut its 
losses and to move ahead with an increased electionyear attack on 
democrats its public denunciation thursday of ed rollins the 
director of the national republican congressional committee 
rollins had suggested in a memo to gop house members that it was 
ok for them to repudiate bushs positions if it helped them get 
elected 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater all but invited rollins 
to resign or be disciplined by the congressional committee

mashhoor a bearded druse moslem 
militiaman greased his ak47 and wrapped it tightly in a plastic 
bag to bury it just in case thousands of gunmen like him are 
doing the same 
after countless bloody battles in the course of lebanons 
15yearold civil war the three main moslem and christian militias 
agreed thursday to withdraw from beirut and its environs but it is 
an uneasy peace 
this rifle is mine mashhoor said i won it in a battle 
in 1984 who knows when i or someone dear to me will need it 
approval of the withdrawal plan came from samir geageas 
rightwing christian lebanese forces militia nabih berris 
moderate shiite amal militia and druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
but hezbollah or party of god held off on promising a pullout 
the shiite group is believed be an umbrella for underground 
extremists holding most of 13 missing westerners in lebanon 
hezbollah with some 3500 mainforce fighters has long feuded 
with the more secular amal for control of lebanons 12 million 
shiites the countrys biggest sect 
the groundwork was laid for the militia withdrawal when 
president elias hrawis syrian backers crushed a mutiny by rebel 
christian gen michel aoun oct 13 in fighting that killed up to 
750 people in eight hours 
the ultimate objective is to be disarm the militias and absorb 
some of their fighters into government security forces but 
hardened gunslingers like mashhoor a nom de guerre meaning 
famous dont believe it will happen 
no one believes theyll be disbanded it never worked before 
it wont work now mashhoor said 
there are about 20000 fighters in the dozen or so militias 
many have their own personal arsenals of automatic weapons grenade 
launchers explosives and hand grenades 
during past disarmament bids fighters handed over some weapons 
but hid most of their arms including tanks artillery and 
mortars 
many of the fighters like mashhoor have known nothing but 
violence they are school dropouts with no skills serving in the 
militia is a meal ticket the fighters simply take what they want 
at restaurants bars and gas stations 
mashhoor has been a member of the druse progressive socialist 
party militia since he was seven years old the civil war is all 
hes ever known 
he was born marwan yahya and grew up in druse town of shweifat 
in the chouf foothills when the war broke out in 1975 he was only 
a child but he quit school to join the fighters 
his first job in the militia was collecting empty cartridge 
cases to be refilled he was dubbed abu khartoush father of the 
bullets 
he attended school on and off during lulls in the fighting 
but he found he no longer fit in 
i was no longer willing to listen to teachers do homework and 
be disciplined he said i was abu khartoush 
at 12 he was renamed abu tabikh or father of food because i 
was driving a land rover and distributing food to fighters on the 
front lines 
in 1983 he proved himself as a fighter battling christians in 
the chouf mountains earning his fighting name warfare has been 
his trade ever since 
unlike mashhoor haidar a 37yearold amal militiaman can now 
earn a living from his peacetime profession before he took up the 
gun he was a house painter 
therell be lots of painting work to do in greater beirut 
he said in an understated reference to the warwrecked capital 
haidar echoes mashhoor in his skepticism that the militia will 
truly lay down arms 
he said amal will withdraw from the south beirut slum of shiyah 
which it controls but he said i have no orders from my 
superiors that the militia will be disbanded 
haidar said hell stay on with his militia as a parttimer he 
said on weekends he would head south to amal bases where the 
fighters would regroup 
i dont believe that the wars over once and for all he 
said i wont burn my bridges

foreign minister david levy on thursday 
rejected the latest un security council censure of israel and 
urged the world to focus on enforcing un demands that iraq 
withdraw from kuwait 
levys comments came one day after the security council rebuked 
israel for not cooperating with a un investigation into the 
killing oct 8 of 19 palestinians on jerusalems temple mount 
israeli soldiers meanwhile blocked the 17 million 
palestinians of the west bank and gaza strip from entering israel 
for a second day thursday in an effort to stem arabjewish 
violence 
defense minister moshe arens ordered the ban on palestinians 
entering after five people were killed and 11 wounded this week in 
several revenge attacks by arabs and jews that date to the temple 
mount deaths 
in the west bank city of nablus the local branch of plo chief 
yasser arafats fatah faction distributed a leaflet condemning 
attacks on jews and saying that jewish and arab blood should not be 
spilled 
blood is blood with the same color and there is no 
difference in religions it said the leaflet was apparently 
meant to counter calls from moslem fundamentalist groups for 
attacks on israelis 
levy made his comment in a talk with diplomats including us 
ambassador william brown the session was private but a levy aide 
later quoted and summarized his statements 
according to the aide levy told the ambassadors that israel 
could not agree to a un mission coming to investigate the 
killings because the resolution that ordered the inquiry was 
biased 
it is prejudging israels guilt ascertaining at the outset 
that jerusalem is an occupied area and that ways should be found to 
protect the palestinians we cannot agree to that he was quoted 
as saying 
levy emphasized the worlds main task should be enforcing 
security council resolutions on the persian gulf and not trying to 
link israel to the iraqi problem in kuwait said the aide who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
yossi ben aharon directorgeneral of prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs office also said israel would ignore the latest un 
rebuke 
aharon told israel army radio he hoped criticism of israel could 
be quieted by its own investigation of the temple mount deaths 
news reports said results of the israeli inquiry may be issued 
friday and will blame senior police officials for the deaths 
stateowned television reported rumors abound that serious 
conclusions will be drawn and of heads rolling after the temple 
mount investigation report is published friday 
police minister roni milo was quoted by the television as 
promising all recommendations of the commission would be carried 
out 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman said the government was 
disappointed with the washington vote for the un resolution 
we are sorry because this helps iraqi president saddam 
hussein to distract the attention from what is happening in the 
gulf to what is happening in jerusalem he told reporters 
faisal husseini the leading plo supporter in jerusalem 
compared israels response to iraqs similar disregard for un 
resolutions he said the two un votes against israel were part of 
a new direction by the world body 
if this new system will start dealing in an unbalanced way 
dealing with iraq in one way and israel in another way it means 
the system will be destroyed he told a news conference 
husseini spoke a day after he was released from jail he had 
been held on suspicion he incited stone throwing on the temple 
mount leading to the police charge with live gunfire husseini 
arrested the day of the killings was freed on bail while police 
continue their investigation 
on thursday palestinians staged a general strike under orders 
from the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement which called on 
palestinians to defy army orders and go to the weeks main prayers 
at the mount on friday 
with arabs blocked from entering israel army radio reported 
that employment agencies received calls from 1000 businesses 
looking for 4500 workers to replace arabs in such lowpaying jobs 
as construction work and dishwashing 
in tel aviv deputy police superintendent shlomo turjeman said 
some employers were hiding their arab workers so police could not 
force them back to the occupied territories

the remains of jan palach a 
student who burned himself to death to protest the 1968 sovietled 
invasion were transferred thursday to one of the capitals most 
honored burial places 
the ceremony was attended by leading officials of the 
noncommunist government including mayor jaroslav koran and 
president vaclav havel according to official television 
palachs selfimmolation has come to symbolize opposition to the 
1968 invasion which the soviets launched to wipe out fledgling 
reforms and restore hardline rule 
havel himself a former dissident was arrested by communist 
authorities on jan 16 1989 as he tried to place flowers in 
memory of palach on pragues wenceslas square 
havels arrest and 8month prison sentence touched off street 
protests and a bloody crackdown eleven months later a peaceful 
revolution toppled communist authorities leading to havels 
selection as president 
palach was originally buried in pragues olsany cemetery after 
he died from burns he suffered when he set himself on fire on 
wenceslas square in january 1969 
his original grave became a place of pilgrimage for those who 
opposed the sovietled crackdown and the communist government 
in 1973 at the communist governments instigation his remains 
were cremated and the urn with his ashes was moved to his native 
village of vsetaty 18 miles north of prague 
they were moved back to olsany cemetery one of pragues most 
revered burial spots on thursday

the consumer organization public citizen 
backtracked for a second time in a week thursday from its critical 
study of the insurance industry saying it had been wrong in saying 
that aetnas property and casualty surpluses had declined 
last friday the consumer group admitted a similar mistake in 
its analysis of the surpluses of the itt hartford insurance group 
we have concluded that neither hartford nor aetna should have 
been highlighted in the report public citizen said 
it said the two companies failed only three of the standards it 
used to judge vulnerability to insolvency 
the original report issued oct 15 said that five of the 
nations top 20 property and casualty insurance companies had 
failed four of the tests indicating they might go under in the 
event of a severe economic downturn 
the five were aetna american international group hartford 
liberty mutual and united states fidelity amp guaranty 
all of the companies disputed the accuracy of the report 
public citizen stands by its report the consumer group 
said the insurance industry is vulnerable to a pattern of 
insolvencies and urgently requires stronger federal and state 
regulation to ensure that consumers are protected 
further the insurance industrys vituperative attack on our 
report shows that it is painfully aware of its overall accuracy and 
credibility the organization said unfortunate as it is the 
mathematical error cited above does not affect the validity of the 
entire report 
public citizen said it employed an independent auditor to go 
over its figures and the audit showed that aetnas surpluses 
increased by 3 percent between 1972 and 1988 instead of declining 
as originally reported

an executive nabbed on a litter violation told a 
hearing examiner thursday that hes a samaritan who was wronged by 
city sanitation enforcement agents 
but jim hart spokesman for the sanitation department said that 
however good their intentions its illegal for people to put big 
stuff in the citys litter baskets 
its a tough situation said hart were asking people to 
pick up litter but they risk a summons if they put it in the 
wrong place 
hart said people sometimes fill up litter baskets with 
residential and commercial waste leaving no room for tissues 
napkins and hot dog wrappers 
he said the litter basket law which has been on the books 30 or 
40 years is being enforced more frequently as budget constraints 
are limiting the number of workers available to empty litter 
baskets 
hart said new litter baskets are now being set out with a 
version of the international no sign a red circle with a slash 
through it surrounding a picture of a chair television plastic 
garbage bag and a box 
the hearing resulted from a summons given to warren mitofsky 
executive director of voter research and surveys which does 
election exit polls and projections for the major television 
networks 
he says he was walking in greenwich village about a block from 
a building he owns last month when he saw two empty cardboard 
boxes someone had thrown onto the street he saw an empty trash can 
nearby he stashed the trash 
i was halfway down the next block when a van pulled up with 
three sanitation police officers in it said mitofsky 
they gave him a summons with a potential fine of 50 to 100 
mitofsky went to his hearing alone i dont think its 
necessary to take a lawyer to garbage court he said 
the hearing examiner listened to his story without comment and 
said a decision would be mailed to him in two to three weeks 
this is outrageous said mitofsky weve got a filthy city 
and theyre trying to fine citizens who pick it up

federal regulators approved on thursday a plan 
to sell or close about 192 failed savings and loan institutions 
over the next six months 
the proposed action which involves assets valued at 119 
billion is part of an operating plan for the resolution trust 
corporation established to oversee the bailout of the financially 
devastated thrift industry 
officials of the rtc oversight board approved the new plan they 
said its implementation would bring to about 479 the total number 
of thrifts whose financial problems have been resolved by 
liquidation or other actions since aug 9 1989 
but they noted that the plan is subject to the congressional 
appropriations process and cannot be completed unless it receives 
full financing 
under the plan the trust corporations oversight board would 
authorize 622 billion in new financing 
this would include 23 billion to resolve the financial problems 
of the 192 savings institutions and 389 billion in working 
capital to be borrowed through the federal financing bank 
the rtc has proposed an ambitious plan for the first six 
months of fiscal 1991 which began on oct 1 which will allow it 
to continue a high level of resolutions said peter h monroe 
the president of the oversight board 
if the rtc meets its target of 192 new resolutions it will 
have sold or closed approximately 90 percent of all thrifts seized 
by the rtc to date monroe said 
the oversight board sets policy approves the financing and 
provides general oversight supervision for the resolution trust 
corp in its task of liquidating the nations failed savings and

it may be time to write superwomans obituary 
if the results of a poll released thursday reflect a new 
generation the legions of american women trying to have it all may 
soon dwindle 
the 505 young men and women surveyed in the time magazine poll 
agreed there is too much pressure on women to juggle the burdens of 
work and family 
but the biggest surprise in the poll 48 percent of the men 
would like to stay home and raise their kids 
the poll of people between the ages of 18 and 24 showed four out 
of five believe it is very difficult or somewhat difficult 
to balance a career marriage and children 
these people are smart enough to realize that the whole myth 
of the superwoman of the 1980s is just that a myth said frank 
mcbride who directed the poll for yankelovich clancy shulman 
even though they were raised in an era when women were going 
to do everything men and women alike are realizing that you cant 
have everything without any pain he said 
those polled also appeared to harbor few illusions about hard 
times ahead for them 
when asked the prospects of a having a good marriage today 56 
percent of the women and 55 percent of the men said it was

a valve loosened by a bump in a road is 
believed to have caused a hydrochloric acid spill that partially 
melted an asphalt highway and forced the evacuation of about 200 
people officials said thursday 
the wednesday night spill left a steaming trail of melted 
asphalt on about a halfmile of us highway 71 said state police 
sgt hamilton mixon 
five alexandria police officers were among the 19 people taken 
to area hospitals and treated for exposure to fumes said beverly 
herring of the alexandria police department 
none of them were seriously hurt the acid fumes kind of burn 
your skin and make it hard to breathe when youre in it she 
said 
a motorist traveling north on us highway 71 noticed something 
leaking from a tanker truck after it hit a bump in the road 
the motorist flagged the truck driver down but not before 
almost 600 gallons of the acid had spilled onto the highway 
james kemp assistant manager of a nearby service station said 
he called 911 after noticing the tanker was leaving a trail of 
steamlike vapor 
the road was smoking from behind the truck kemp said it 
looked like steam rising off the ground 
a partial evacuation of homes near the spill was ordered shortly 
after the accident and was canceled about 8 hours later said 
state police trooper michael hataway 
hydrochloric acid is a colorless corrosive liquid inhaling its 
vapor can irritate the mouth nose throat and lungs causing 
coughing shortness of breath pulmonary edema and even death 
emergency workers spread soda ash powder on the road to 
neutralize the acid the company that owned the truck alphachem 
of reserve sent a cleanup crew to the scene 
mixon said officials were investigating possible charges against 
the truck driver

seventytwo congressman demanded thursday that 
prison officials tell them why manuel noriega has an exercise bike 
paper shredder copier computer and two safes in his jail cell 
attorneys for the deposed panamanian leader said the threeroom 
cell and its furnishings were forced on their client by government 
security regulations and prosecutors insistence that classified 
information be protected 
us rep larry smith dfla fired off a letter to the us 
bureau of prisons after reading in the miami herald about the 
facilities at noriegas cell in the metropolitan correctional 
center outside miami the letter was cosigned by 71 other 
congressmen from both parties 
its obviously special treatment and if the taxpayers are 
paying for it its disgraceful smith said thursday who puts 
safes in criminals quarters i dont understand that at all what 
if he had a gun in there 
the prison agency did not immediately return telephone calls 
from the associated press smith said he expected a reply by 
friday 
noriegas defense attorney jon may said smith and the other 
lawmakers will be disappointed with the answer and he said the 
defense attorneys and their client would be happy to relinquish 
most perks 
noriega has a bicycle propped up on a stand because hes in 
isolation said may he does not have access to the volleyball 
field or the weight room or any of the other facilities the other 
prisoners have 
prosecutors provided the defense team with the shredder copying 
machine computers and safes to handle reams of classified 
information may said 
the sole reason they were provided at mcc is that i cannot 
meet with the general in the regular conference area said may 
the computer and copying machine are in a room the lawyers use and 
noriega has no access to them he said 
the government insisted on the safes to protect classified 
information said may 
would congressman smith want classified information kept 
loosely in the generals cell the way other papers are kept he 
asked 
the special cell was built because mcc is not as secure as 
federal prisons in atlanta and marion ill where the government 
initially wanted to send noriega following his surrender to us 
authorities in panama 
us district judge william hoeveler decided that moving noriega 
would place a burden on his defense team in the complicated 
drugtrafficking case 
i would invite the congressman to come to mcc and see the 
generals situation the attorney said its not because hes 
afforded special privileges its because he has fewer 
privileges 
noriega has been at the prison since january when he 
surrendered two weeks after the us invasion of panama 
he is being held on a february 1988 indictment accusing him of 
accepting 46 million in bribes to protect colombias medellin 
drug cartel operations in panama

the parliament of the slovak 
republic on thursday made slovak the official language but 
protesters seeking stronger legislation demanded that lawmakers 
resign 
the law was approved by a vote of 8251 with 10 abstentions 
after a nearly allday debate thousands of demonstrators had 
waited outside parliament in bratislava the slovak capital for 
lawmakers to decide 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel and top foreign leaders have 
expressed worries that nationalism will upset this countrys 
stability and damage efforts to shed its communist past 
some slovaks whose republic makes up the more rural eastern 
part of the country say they have been dominated too long by 
czechs from the national capital prague 
the law approved late thursday declares slovak the official 
language but it allows minorities to use their own language for 
official communications in regions where they make up at least 10 
percent of the population 
a tougher version backed by the separatist slovak national 
party had called for slovak to be the official language without 
exception 
slovakia has sizeable minorities the largest is an ethnic 
hungarian population of at least 570000 which makes up more than 
10 percent of the republics population 
vitazoslav moric chairman of the slovak national party told 
about 8000 demonstrators outside parliament that lawmakers were 
ignoring the will of the slovak majority 
the rally considers the parliament as illegitimate and unable 
to represent the interests of the slovak nation he said in 
remarks reported by the ctk news agency for this reason we 
demand the resignation of the deputies of parliament and new 
elections 
he also promised protest actions in the whole territory of the 
slovak republic which will include also civil disobedience 
after the vote was announced the protesters chanted slogans 
against the government and parliament and speakers called for a 
republicwide strike to start friday and last until the government 
falls 
the version of the law approved by parliament was proposed by 
the coalition of public against violence the christian democratic 
movement and the democratic party ctk said 
public against violence is the partner of the czech lands civic 
forum it is the largest single party in the slovak parliament 
with 48 seats 
the christian democratic movement has 31 and the democratic 
party has seven among the three groups they hold a majority of 
seats 
the slovak national party has 22 parliamentary seats 
ctk also reported that havel criticized the separatist slovak 
party while speaking to a parliamentary committee of the czech 
republic 
the news agency quoted havel as saying the slovak national party 
had used the language issue to organize large demonstrations he 
said many people who took part did not know what the question was 
or what the differences were among different proposals 
the main source for doubts about czechoslovakia abroad are the 
problems of the constitutional arrangement of our country he was 
quoted as saying all potential partners economic or political 
are waiting for czechoslovakia to be a united and disciplined 
partner

lebanons maronite catholic church on 
thursday accused syrian forces of summarily executing soldiers 
loyal to rebel gen michel aoun when he was defeated in battle this 
month 
the clergymen also demanded the release of rebel officers 
detained by the syrian army they appealed to the syrianbacked 
government of elias hrawi to arrange the evacuation of syrian 
troops from monasteries and christian hospitals 
the buildings in aouns stronghold were occupied after syrian 
and government troops stormed his rebel army on oct 13 forcing 
the defeated general to flee to the french embassy 
the statement issued by the archbishops of the maronite 
community the largest christian sect in lebanon said some of 
gen aouns officers had been deliberately killed and others are 
being held by nonlebanese authorities 
this is a humiliation that cannot be justified by the fall of 
casualties in the opposite side for whom we feel sorry 
the clergymen were alluding to reports of summary executions of 
supporters of aoun after they surrendered to the syrians who lost 
300 soldiers in the battle about 250 other people were killed 
hrawis government has denied that aouns followers were 
executed saying all casualties fell in the fighting 
it was not clear from the church statement how many of aouns 
followers have been detained 
hrawi is a maronite like aoun the millionmember community has 
dominated power in lebanon since independence from france in 1943

the white house on thursday all but invited 
the firing of a highranking republican campaign official who told 
gop candidates to feel free to break away from president bushs 
policies 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to express 
confidence in the official edward j rollins rollins is 
cochairman of the national republican congressional committee and 
a onetime political director in ronald reagans white house 
despite the white house unhappiness with his remark rollins 
job apparently is safe for now there was no suggestion of eds 
leaving before the election said rep guy vander jagt rmich 
chairman of the committee he spoke with reporters after bush met 
with gop leaders 
rollins angered the white house with an oct 15 memo advising 
candidates on necessary changes in your campaign theme and 
message rollins said the mood of the country had shifted 
dramatically over the past 10 days and that voters were as 
pessimistic about the direction of the country as at any time in 
history 
saying that voters were confused about republican positions on 
taxes rollins wrote do not hesitate to oppose either the 
president or budget proposals advanced in congress 
the gop committee played down the flap 
is he in hot water good question said john roberts 
communications director of the congressional committee we dont 
have any indication that he is honestly if in fact the president 
wanted him replaced we havent heard it bush during a rose 
garden appearance dodged questions about rollins 
fitzwater said rollins remarks were not helpful i think the 
national republican congressional committee will be able to take 
charge of this situation 
asked if rollins should be fired fitzwater replied thats up 
to the committee 
roberts said rollins has made a commitment to work for the 
committee through the 1992 elections i think he probably will 
honor that commitment 
republicans have abandoned bush in droves on the budget and 
some gop candidates are avoiding the president shelving political 
commercials hes made on their behalf bush even has been 
confronted by criticism on the campaign trail by candidates he is 
supporting 
a senior white house official said there was a distinction 
between opposing the budget plan endorsed by bush and appearing to 
attack the president 
he doesnt mind them beating up on the deal theres nobody 
who likes them beating up on him said the official insisting on 
anonymity 
trying to squelch talk of gop disarray fitzwater said 
president bush is a great asset to any republican 
pressed on whether rollins should be fired fitzwater said 
this is a matter for the committee he works for them we 
certainly made our views known obviously were not happy with 
his comments the other day 
the white house hurriedly arranged a unity picture of bush 
and gop leaders in congress including rep newt gingrich of 
georgia who led republicans in abandoning bush and his original 
budget deal with the democrats 
i think all of us are totally united in our determination to 
take a sound strong republican message across this country bush 
said 
the point is were unified and trying to win these 
elections the president said 
gingrich said the gop leaders wanted to meet with bush to lay 
out the framework for the campaign for the last 10 days of the 
year the congressmen said republicans have sharp differences 
with democrats on issues such as crime drugs government 
regulations and taxes 
gingrich refused to pledge support for the latest budget deal 
while stressing unity house minority leader robert michel 
rill said there are those issues from time to time on which 
we cant all be together and this happens to be one of those

a us bishop on thursday defended a meeting he held 
with married former priests he spoke after reports the vatican had 
frowned on the session because it could encourage opponents of the 
rule of priestly celibacy 
the bishop donald wuerl of pittsburgh has been in rome this 
month for an international gathering of bishops convened by pope 
john paul ii to discuss the formation of priests 
although celibacy wasnt on the synods official agenda several 
bishops have raised questions about the roman catholic churchs 
insistence that priests lead celibate lives 
wuerl said his meeting with the expriests in june in the united 
states shouldnt be construed as a criticism of church policy 
requiring that priests abstain from sex and marriage 
i listen to what someone has to say but then i say what i 
have to say wuerl said i think those kind of 
conversations go on all the time not just on priestly celibacy 
but on every aspect 
the new york times reported wednesday that wuerl had received a 
letter from the vatican warning that such encounters could erode 
the churchs celibacy rule 
referring to the vaticans interest in the encounter wuerl 
said a request came for information about what happened to 
which i responded as was my responsibility any other 
interpretation of that im really not comfortable with because it 
takes it beyond the fact 
wuerl spoke at a news conference with archbishop daniel e 
pilarczyk of cincinnati who heads the us bishops conference 
asked if the synod would further debate celibacy pilarczyk 
said if debate means discussion nobody can put an end to any 
discussion if debate means considering whether a law or discipline 
should be changed in that sense the debate is closed 
wuerl following pilarczyks distinction between discussion 
and debate used the word discussionto describe his 
meeting with the former priests 
if youre talking to someone about something very dear to 
them thats a discussion wuerl said 
the vaticans letter was reportedly sent by cardinal antonio 
innocenti head of the vatican office that oversees clergy 
speaking of the sentiments expressed at the synod now in its 
fourth week pilarczyk said my perception is that bishops on the 
whole the vast vast majority are saying we want to reaffirm the 
usefulness and appropriateness of priestly celibacy as strongly as 
we can 
a cardinal from brazil disclosed earlier in the synod that two 
married men in his country had become priests with papal approval 
the vatican on occasion has also approved married priests who 
converted to roman catholicism from christian denominations without 
celibacy rules

a large majority of roman catholics oppose 
us bishops involvement in abortion politics according to a 
survey released thursday by a private group of catholics 
the poll commissioned by catholics for a free choice found that 
71 percent of catholics and 74 percent of all respondents said 
catholic bishops should not use the political arena to advance 
their moral opinions 
what we find is that catholics and noncatholics are opposed 
to the style and approach the bishops are taking on abortion 
politics frances kissling president of catholics for a free 
choice said at a news conference 
helen alvare public information director at the prolife office 
of the national conference of catholic bishops disagreed withthe 
results of the survey 
it promotes the idea that the bishops shouldnt speak out on 
the human rights issue of abortion she said it would prefer 
to gag us as moral leaders in the public square 
in fact the bishops wont be silenced on any human rights 
issue including thinks like economic justice civil rights or 
abortion alvare said contending that most of the poll questions 
involved the churchs getting involved in elections which we 
dont do 
she also said the survey did not distinguish between regular 
churchgoing catholics and catholics who dont go to church 
regularly 
kissling said the us catholic conference and a number of 
bishops were inappropriately participating in the political process 
by attacking individual candidates and elected officials whose 
views on abortion differ from theirs 
she pointed to several examples including cardinal john 
oconnor raising the possibility of excommunicating prochoice 
catholics and guams bishop threatening catholic lawmakers with 
excommunication if they voted against the territorys new abortion 
bill 
they have a right to preach against abortion but they have no 
right to coerce she said contending the bishops have been 
using legislators as their own private police force 
she also cited the bishops hiring of a public relations company 
and a polling firm for a nationwide campaign to persuade catholics 
and noncatholics to oppose abortion 
of the 2002 adults polled nationwide 523 said they were 
catholic the margin of error for the entire sampling is 21 
percentage points and the margin of error for the sample of 
catholics is 42 percentage points 
the poll was conducted by krc research and consulting inc 
surveying was done by telephone oct 1221 
catholics for a free choice describes itself as a national 
education organization that supports the right to legal 
reproductive health care especially the right to family planning 
and abortion

the appeals of florida prisoners who 
are condemned to die are badly backed up and the system needs 
streamlining the state supreme court said in naming a committee to 
investigate the problem 
the high court also cited the problem when it stayed the 
executions of two death row inmates scheduled for the electric 
chair nov 28 their execution dates were postponed until march 
because the state office that represents condemned murderers says 
it doesnt have the staff or money to take the cases 
the state agency working on behalf of the condemned is called 
the capital collateral representative larry spalding who heads 
the agency said thursday he welcomes the courts effort 
last year for example 27 people did the work of 70 
spalding said of that number 10 lawyers did the work of 32 and 
we still cant keep up 
gov bob martinez signs about 45 execution orders annually he 
said 
in an administrative order wednesday the high court said it 
appears that the credibility of the entire process is being 
jeopardized by the untimely way in how these matters are being 
considered and resolved 
peter dunbar the governors general counsel blamed the delays 
on those who oppose capital punishment he said that when private 
lawyers handled death row cases they didnt have such delays 
the truth is these procedural hurdles are used by opponents of 
the death penalty to frustrate the process dunbar said 
spalding and dunbar are on the high courts committee along 
with attorney general bob butterworth steven goldstein a florida 
state university law professor james fox miller president of the 
florida bar association and former bar president james rinaman 
they will study the process of appeals and make their 
recommendations by march 15 
the inmates given reprieves were samuel rivera and jason dirk 
walton 
rivera was condemned to death for killing a police officer at a 
shopping mall in 1986 walton was condemned for shooting three 
people during a home robbery in 1982

albanias leading writer ismail kadare sought and 
was granted asylum in france on thursday he said communist 
hardliners in his homeland reneged on promises to promote 
democracy 
in southern france meanwhile 71 romanian soccer fans failed to 
board a chartered plane back to bucharest and at least 22 applied 
for political asylum authorities said 
kadare 54 said he decided to seek asylum after becoming 
convinced that albanias leaders despite reformist rhetoric had 
no intention of emulating the political changes that swept through 
eastern europe the past year 
the promises made were not kept and my disillusion like that 
of the immense majority of albanians was all the more bitter he 
said in a statement 
foreign minister roland dumas later said kadares request for 
asylum ha been granted 
news of the defection reached albania as the government played 
host to a conference of foreign ministers from other balkan 
nations resulting in the unusual presence in tirana of a large 
number of foreign journalists 
kadare former head of the national writers union occasionally 
defended official policy in the past but he became increasingly 
critical in recent months leading a group of intellectuals who 
denounced the governments stalinist ideologies and accused the 
security services of abuses 
there was no immediate official reaction to the defection but 
his decision caught many albanians by surprise 
mirlinda angoni a journalist for the state news agency ata 
said she thought kadares defection would provoke resentment 
toward him 
kadares books are widely available in albania and several have 
been published in france at least two of his books doruntine 
and chronicles in stone have been published in the united 
states 
kadares style has been compared to that of the colombian 
fabulist writer gabriel garcia marquez his stories and novels 
often deal with the countrys byzantine history and traditional 
themes of honor and local custom 
kadare told the french newspaper le monde that his wife and two 
daughters had accompanied him to france and would stay with him he 
said he left his mother brother and sister behind 
the other asylum case unfolded in the southern city of 
montpellier where about 100 romanians had come to watch steaua 
bucharest play in a european cupwinners cup match wednesday night 
montpellier won 50 
officials said only about 30 romanians left on the return flight 
to bucharest by evening 22 members of the group had shown up at 
government offices to seek political asylum while the others 
reportedly headed north by train to paris or lyon 
kadares bid for political asylum was first announced by his 
french publisher claude durand who holds the authors 
international rights 
kadare released the text of a letter sent tuesday to albanian 
president ramiz alia explaining his decision 
until today i have tried to help soften the regime to the 
extent this is authorized in albania he wrote in the course 
of my meetings and an exchange of letters which i had with the 
president last spring i expressed very clearly the necessity for a 
rapid profound and complete democratization of the country 
because there is no possibility of legal opposition in 
albania i have chosen this course which i never wished to take and 
which i will not recommend to others 
the author of several novels essays and poetry collections 
kadare had not been considered an outspoken dissident in past 
years although his recent works contained antitotalitarian 
themes 
he described his decision as the logical extension of all that 
i have argued for until now in my work 
i hope to return to my country one day following a true 
democratization he said 
kadare is fluent in french and has visited france many times

iraq has shifted vital equipment from 
factories making armaments and chemical weapons to secret locations 
for security reasons the rebel kurdish group said thursday 
the decision was made by the iraqi defense ministry early in 
october said the statement faxed to the associated press in 
nicosia from the kurdistan democratic partys office in london 
the statement said the group learned that on oct 16 the 
contents of the al taji armaments factory in the al taji barracks 
and the chemical plant at samara both north of baghdad were 
moved 
it added that other sensitive military installations have also 
been vacated except for the al qaim chemical plant now 
specializing in producing binary chemical shells in western iraq 
the site is the most heavily defended in iraq by a massive 
airdefense system and ground troops 
the fax did not elaborate on how the information has been 
obtained or why the iraqis would have moved the equipment 
however iraqi authorities have moved some western hostages to 
strategic sites fearing a us air attack in the aftermath of 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the kurdistan democratic party is an outlawed group fighting for 
autonomy from the central baghdad government for several decades 
in another development the official iraqi news agency 
monitored in nicosia reported that iraqi president saddam hussein 
has toured the kurdish province of suleimaniya to inquire about 
conditions of inhabitants it did not say when the visit occurred 
the trip apparently was designed to boost his popularity among 
the kurds traditionally his main opponents within iraq 
it said thousands of people greeted him and showed support for 
his stand against antiiraqi forces that massed in saudi arabia 
after the invasion

monthly injections of a newly approved drug for 
treating endometriosis could help hundreds of thousands of women 
who have the fertilitythreatening condition doctors said 
thursday 
the drug a prostatecancer medicine called lupron depot is 
already commonly prescribed for endometriosis doctors know it 
works to reverse the malady and relieve its sometimes debilitating 
pain gynecologists said 
but the government had not approved its use for treating 
anything other than prostate cancer and insurance companies refused 
to cover its costs 252 for monthly injections which are 
typically administered for six months doctors said 
its a drug thats welltolerated its side effects are 
minimal and its an exciting development that we now have 
approval said dr gary a shangold associate professor of 
obstetrics and gynecology at the university of chicago 
he spoke at a press confeence held by the manufacturer tap 
pharmaceuticals the deerfieldbased company said it was notified 
monday that the us food and drug administration had approved 
lupron depot for treating endometriosis 
the drug suppresses production of the female hormone estrogen 
which controls growth of the tissue that lines the womb called the 
endometrium 
endometriosis occurs when that tissue migrates outside the womb 
usually into the abdomen and pelvis where it swells and bleeds 
during menstruation if it develops in the ovaries or fallopian 
tubes it can cause blockage scarring and infertility 
an estimated 2 million to 5 million women have endometriosis 
which may be mild and symptom free but the condition also may 
cause severe menstrual cramps pain during sexual intercourse 
painful urination or painful bowel movements 
side effects of lupron depot resemble those of menopause 
including hot flashes but are not permanent and may be relieved 
with other medication 
in essence what were doing is creating a temporary 
medically induced menopause a reversible menopause that in turn 
stops the stimulation of the endometriosis said dr james 
miller medical director at tap 
the company is a joint venture between japanese pharmaceutical 
company takeda chemical industries and north chicagobased abbott 
laboratories 
other doctors said the approval should open the way for using 
the drug for a variety of gynecological problems such as 
premenstrual syndrome uterine fibroid tumors and even benign 
breast tumors 
i think its very significant dr robert l barbieri 
chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at state university of new 
york at stony brook said of thursdays announcement 
he estimated it could help up to onethird of women who have 
endometriosis including by heading off surgery 
barbieri said the only other drugs approved for treating 
endometriosis are synarel a nasal spray that costs about the same 
as lupron depot and danazol a derivative of the male hormone 
testosterone that costs about half as much 
synarel requires twice daily doses for six months and is poorly 
absorbed by the body barbieri said danazol causes women to 
develop male traits a deepening of the voice facial hair oilier 
skin and upper body muscles he said 
as for lupron depot the main down side of the drug is it does 
cause a low estrogen state and it may cause thinning of vertebral 
bones barbieri said he said further study will be necessary to 
determine whether the amount of bone thinning is significant

a cabinet minister acknowledged thursday 
that sudan is facing a food crisis but the government rejected 
claims by relief workers that millions of its residents are 
threatened by famine 
a top us relief official meanwhile told congress in 
washington on thursday that a famine of biblical proportions 
imperiled as many as 11 million sudanese 
sudans agriculture minister ahmed ali genaif speaking at a 
news conference in khartoum said there was no famine but the 
country was confronted with a food gap that should be handled 
seasonal rains were delayed genaif said prompting western 
relief organizations to raise the alarm of a food crisis but the 
rains had started and the situation was under control 
he acknowledged however that while projected figures showed 
crops this winter should produce 400000 tons of wheat and 18 
million tons of sorghum the country needs more than twice as much 
wheat and 25 million tons of sorghum to feed its people 
foreign minister ali sahlul met thursday with harold norton the 
representative of the food and agriculture organization in 
khartoum to thank the un agency for a donation of 25000 tons of 
wheat the official sudan news agency reported 
a ship loaded with 19000 tons of wheat was ordered to sail to 
sudan immediately to help sudan cover urgent needs 
in washington andrew natsios the us administrations top 
relief official said the sudanese government is increasingly 
indifferent if not overtly hostile to the relief efforts 
undertaken by the international community 
most of the sudanese threatened by famine live in southern 
sudan where a civil war between rebels and government troops has 
been waged since 1983 the government has barred food shipments to 
the south where the countryside is largely controlled by the 
rebels 
a government statement said thursday that 22 rebels of the sudan 
peoples liberation army had been killed at yei in the equatoria 
region 825 miles south of khartoum it said a government soldier 
was also killed in the fighting but did not say when the battle 
took place 
the report could not be independently verified because reporters 
are barred from the war zone

a jamaican immigrant burst into tears 
thursday after his acquittal on charges of killing a boston police 
detective ending a trial that raised questions about whether 
police doctored evidence 
what they tried to do to me im a good person albert 
lewin whispered after a jury found him innocent 
i never knew that the united states was like this he later 
told reporters 
lewin 34 had been in boston a few months when he was accused 
of firing shots that blasted through a closed apartment door and 
killed detective sherman griffiths during a 1988 drug raid 
i think it had to be obvious to the jury that there was no 
credible evidence said lewins attorney max stern 
the only physical evidence that linked lewin with the murder 
weapon was a fingerprint on the gun lewin was arrested after he 
was found with several other people in an apartment downstairs from 
where the raid occured feb 17 1988 
lewin still faces deportation to jamaica as an illegal alien 
two defense witnesses including a retired fingerprint expert 
for state police testified there were signs the print had been 
transferred onto the gun the fingerprint was reported by an fbi 
expert some 30 months after the killing and then was destroyed 
i was disappointed thomas mundy assistant suffolk county 
district attorney said of the verdict i cant find fault with 
the jury i cant believe they didnt believe it was lewins 
fingerprint on the gun 
brian griffiths a brother of the 36yearold slain officer 
read a statement saying the family was very hurt and 
disappointed by the verdict 
sherman was a proud and dedicated member of the boston police 
departments drug control unit and no decision will ever take that 
away from him he said sherman died for a cause and his death 
will never be in vain 
the verdict was another setback for boston police still reeling 
from the charles stuart case last october 
in that case a man claimed his pregnant wife had been shot by a 
black man as they drove through a boston neighborhood police 
arrested a black man 
when stuart later was implicated in the slaying and committed 
suicide community leaders said police acted too quickly to arrest 
a black suspect 
the lewin case was moved 90 miles from boston because of 
extensive publicity

a democratic congresswoman trying to win 
senate votes for the civil rights bill says a republican senator 
proved the need for the bill by shooing her to the back of the 
chamber 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif said she and other congresswomen 
were in the senate on wednesday encouraging members to override the 
presidents veto of the civil rights act 
we have a right to be on the floor as members of congress 
she said but sen rudy boschwitz kept telling us to go to the 
back ladies i dont know if he didnt realize we were members of 
congress or what 
there we were trying to improve conditions for women in the 
workplace and we were being told go to the back ladies go to the 
back 
boschwitz press secretary tim droogsma said mrs pelosi was 
being loud house members have senate floor privileges they do 
not have speaking privileges 
droogsma said that boschwitz and other senators were trying to 
hear the debate but were being disturbed by mrs pelosi he said 
any effort to equate the incident with sex discrimination 
trivializes the civil rights act 
she was simply asked to take her conversation away he said 
the minnesota senator who is running for reelection voted 
against the civil rights act when the senate took its original 
action on the bill he voted however to override becoming the 
only senator to change his mind 
polls show that boschwitz who started with an enormous lead 
over democratic challenger paul wellstone is now leading by only a 
3 point margin

the soviet union said thursday that its 
employees in the united nations no longer must pay part of their 
salaries to moscow which for decades reportedly used the hard 
currency to fund espionage 
the announcement by deputy foreign minister valentin nikiforov 
was a concession to reality soviet un workers rebelled against 
the soviet missions control this summer and many refused to turn 
over their paychecks 
a un administrative tribunal ruled that most of their 
contracts which gave moscow the right to require then to return 
home in two to four years were invalid that freed the soviet 
employees to seek independent un contracts 
soviet employees indicated the threat of being returned home was 
used for years to force them to accept soviet payment terms 
the un tribunal also invalidated many shortterm contracts of 
chinese un employees it ruled that staffers with five years or 
more experience could apply directly to the world body to renew 
their contracts 
for years chinese soviet and other eastern european workers at 
the united nations have had to turn over their paychecks to their 
countries un missions the soviets lost about 40 percent of the 
value of their pay this way 
soviet employees said the soviet mission paid their rent and 
gave them monthly allowances of 1000 to 1400 keeping the rest 
rossen vassilev a former bulgarian un employee who defected 
in 1988 said soviet bloc nations recycled the confiscated cash to 
fund espionage in the west 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said in 1988 that 
moscow would let some soviets apply for longterm un contracts 
the soviet mission said only about 10 soviet professionals have 
accepted permanent contracts so far 
but nikiforov said all soviets would be permitted to seek 
longterm contracts starting jan 1 
the soviet union has about 450 staffers in the secretariat in 
new york and overseas about 500 other soviets work in 
unaffiliated agencies in geneva rome vienna paris nairobi 
montreal and washington almost all work on shortterm contracts

a soviet journalist dropped from sight 
six days after a peace delegation he was with returned home but 
unlike the cold war days no one seemed bothered by the 
disappearance officials said thursday 
us immigration officials said maxim a kniazkov has not sought 
asylum and probably has a visa good for six months his host in 
kansas hasnt heard from him no one knew thursday where kniazkov 
might be 
ive inquired as many different ways as i could said rick 
plumlee who opened his lawrence home to kniazkov during his 
weeklong visit to attend the meeting for peace 
the program is a cultural exchange in which soviet citizens 
stayed with kansas families and toured the state kniazkov who 
works for the soviet news agency tass was among 250 soviets at the 
gathering in lawrence that ended oct 19 the day his delegation 
flew home without him 
georgi grechko who headed the soviet delegation said at the 
time that kniazkov could stay if he so desired grechko said he was 
surprised kniazkovs disappearance attracted media interest 
this is a very old way of thinking that this is a big 
deal he said 
a soviet expert at the university of kansas gerald mikkelson 
said kniazkovs apparent decision to stay behind would have been 
unheard of 10 years ago 
i think the prevailing attitude now is so what if he wants 
to stay in the united states thats his business mikkelson 
said im not saying they dont care whether their people come 
back or not but if this guy is footloose he just frees up a 
little space for someone else to occupy

a senior israeli official on thursday 
departed for ethiopia in hopes of easing the plight of thousands of 
ethiopian jews waiting to immigrate to the jewish state 
i hope the picture i bring back from there can perhaps help us 
find ways to help them deputy science minister geula cohen said 
before departure at ben gurion international airport near tel aviv 
she belongs to a special cabinet committee on immigration 
mrs cohens trip came amid heightened efforts by israel to 
bring most of the 22000 ethiopian jews in that country to israel 
and unite them with their families thousands of jews left ethiopia 
for israel in the last decade 
most ethiopian jews have been stranded in the capital of addis 
ababa after gathering there from outlying villages to await 
departure 
ethiopian activists in israel said some of the refugees have 
died from starvation and disease 
on sunday prime minister yitzhak shamir promised 
representatives of the 17000 ethiopian jews in israel that the 
country was doing all it can for their brothers in ethiopia 
we are in contact with the ethiopian government to allow 
greater emigration shamir added according to a communique 
published by his office monday he also promised to send doctors to 
treat the refugees in addis ababa 
about 8000 ethiopians came to israel during the secret 
operation moses rescue mission in 198485 the effort came to 
an abrupt halt when news of the air lift was leaked to the press 
at the time ethiopia lacked diplomatic ties with israel but 
ties were reestablished in october 1989 and ethiopias government 
began permitting about 500 jews a month to reach israel that 
arrangement broke down in july without explanation

the pentagon is laying plans to send as many 
as 100000 more troops to saudi arabia but the expanded buildup 
does not signal a us intent to attack iraq defense secretary 
dick cheney said thursday 
cia director william webster meanwhile suggested a growing 
us reluctance to let iraqi president saddam hussein survive the 
current crisis in power even if he withdraws from kuwait 
webster said the persian gulf region will not be secure unless 
saddam is removed from power or he is disassociated from his 
chemical weapons and reported efforts to acquire nuclear arms 
on capitol hill there was concern over the administrations 
course and worry that once congress leaves town bush might feel 
less constrained to follow a peaceful path 
i am not convinced that this administration will do everything 
in its power to avoid war said sen robert kerrey dneb 
expressing the same sentiments as many of his colleagues who have 
supported the gulf deployment 
kerrey a vietnam veteran and medal of honor winner said if 
ever there was an avoidable war it is this one 
the pentagons disclosure earlier this week that it was 
considering adding troops to operation desert shield beyond the 
240000 already there or en route raised questions about whether 
the deployment was being tailored for an offensive 
the saudi ambassador pince bandar bin sultan said after a late 
afternoon meeting with senior state department officials the 
issue of peace or war is in the hands of saddam hussein hussein 
he said is playing with the emotions of everybody with this game 
with the hostages 
asked why the united states was sending more troops the 
ambassador replied it just means we will not take any chances 
prince bandar met with robert kimmitt under secretary for 
political affairs and morris busby head of the departments 
counterterrorism office asked if saudi arabia faced a new 
terrorist threat the ambassador declined to answer 
webster said in a breakfast speech the cia had received 
encouraging reports of dissaffection in iraq he did not 
elaborate on where this dissent could be found bandar said he had 
great respect for iraqs armed forces and added i can 
understand why they have great discontent with their leader he 
declined further comment on intelligence topics 
cheney speaking in a series of interviews with the television 
networks abc cbs nbc and cnn said the bush administration had 
not set an upper limit on troop deployments to saudi arabia he 
said he wanted to have enough forces there to deal with any 
contingency 
the defense secretary said his orders from bush were to use 
american forces to deter saddam from invading saudi arabia to 
prepare to defend the saudi kingdom in the event of an attack and 
to enforce the un sanctions against iraq 
we want to have the capability for the president to make the 
decision to use other options should that become necessary in 
response to a provocation for example cheney said he was 
referring to a possible us offensive action 
at another point he said for a number of reasons i would 
expect a continuing flow of forces to the gulf in the period 
ahead 
cheney did not provide details of the additional us 
deployments planned when asked by an interviewer whether as many 
as 100000 more troops might be sent cheney said its 
conceivable that well end up with that big an increase 
cheneys spokesman pete williams later told reporters that 
cheney was not suggesting that a decision had been made on how many 
extra troops to deploy 
the need to expand desert shield already the biggest us 
military operation since vietnam is based in part on increases in 
iraqi troop strength in occupied kuwait since the first us 
deployments began in early august williams said 
the pentagon estimates that about 430000 iraqi troops are in 
and around kuwait now compared with about 150000 in august when 
the american deployment plan was put together 
williams said the request for more troops came from gen h 
norman schwarzkopf commander in chief of all us forces in the 
persian gulf area schwarzkopf met earlier this week in saudi 
arabia with gen colin l powell the chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff to discuss possible additional troop deployments 
williams said that powell had relayed his advice to cheney in 
recent days and that the two likely would discuss the situation in 
more depth early next week 
williams indicated that cheney was considering transferring as 
many as 50000 troops from germany to saudi arabia but that plans 
were incomplete he did not specify whether the forces from europe 
would rotate to saudi arabia as replacements for or additions to 
the troops that have been there for several weeks 
the spokesman sought to play down cheneys comment that 100000 
more troops might be sent 
i want to steer you away from the notion that there is some 
piece of paper on how many additional forces to send to saudi 
arabia that the secretary is waiting to act on williams said 
the spokesman said no usbased combat troops had been alerted 
to prepare for deployment to saudi arabia beyond those originally 
committed to desert shield but he said 50000 us forces in 
europe know they will be leaving in coming months 
now they understand that they may go through saudi arabia on 
the way home williams said 
us forces now in saudi arabia include four army divisions 
three marine corps expeditionary brigades an air defense artillery 
brigade a mechanized infantry brigade and an armored cavalry 
regiment also in the gulf area are more than 500 us aircraft and 
55 ships 
also on thursday congress made it more likely that combat 
reserve units would be called to active duty for desert shield 
house and senate negotiators added to the 1991 defense spending 
bill an extension of the reserve duty period to 360 days from 180 
days for combat arms only 
the pentagon had said it wanted the extension before using any 
combat reserves the house passed the bill thursday and the senate 
was expected to take it up friday

foreign envoys in rwanda said thursday 
they saw no signs to support reports of a ceasefire in the 
monthold fighting between the government and rebels 
i have no evidence of a ceasefire said a western diplomat 
i have not heard of it except from foreign news reports 
another western diplomat said he doubted a ceasefire would hold 
between the rebel rwandese patriotic front and president juvenal 
habyarimanas government 
a ceasefire would mean the rebels would stay where they 
are the diplomat said that would mean giving the rebels part 
of the country i doubt habyarimana would agree to that 
the diplomats were interviewed by telephone from kenyas 
capital nairobi and requested anonymity 
belgian foreign minister mark eyskens told journalists wednesday 
in nairobi that rwandas government had accepted an unconditional 
ceasefire earlier in the day 
state radio reported government troops killed 320 rebels and 
themselves lost 10 soldiers in fighting tuesday 
the fighting is about 37 miles northeast of the capital of 
kigali which the envoys said remained calm wednesday 
eyskens proposed african nations provide a neutral force to 
monitor a ceasefire he said belgium which formerly ruled rwanda 
as a colony would provide logistical and financial support 
esykens said he had learned of the halt in fighting by telephone 
from rwandas foreign minister casimir bizimungu ugandan 
president yoweri museveni announced monday that the rebels had 
accepted a ceasefire 
the belgians who have been leading international efforts to 
settle the conflict peacefully were concluding a second meeting 
with the regions leaders 
martens said belgium would decide friday whether to withdrew its 
troops sent soon after the rebels invaded sept 30 from uganda 
in zaire neighboring rwanda government sources said that at a 
summit earlier this week the leaders of zaire burundi and rwanda 
had advocated the fromation of an african peacekeeping force to be 
deployed as soon as a ceasefire took hold

the us supreme court granted a stay thursday to 
allow an allblack slate of candidates to appear on the nov 6 
ballot a move county officials said will throw election plans into 
chaos 
harold washington party leaders delighted in the win cook 
county officials said the court decision could cost taxpayers up to 
2 million 
the order less than two weeks before the general election is 
a complete victory for us a complete victory for the people 
said eugene pincham leader of the party named for the citys first 
black mayor who died in 1987 
county clerk stanley kusper said of the stay were sitting in 
here pulling out our collective hair 
most ballots already have been printed without the washington 
party candidates 
kusper said elections officials made lastminute plans to give 
voters a looseleaf booklet much like an absentee ballot including 
the names of all candidates including members of the harold 
washington party 
now voters will get a separate list of candidates names and 
will have to match the numbers on the booklet with numbers on a 
punch card 
the supreme court order let stand an aug 29 cook county 
electoral board decision that allowed harold washington party 
candidates to be listed on city and county ballots 
the illinois supreme court ruled oct 12 that washington party 
candidates should not be allowed on the ballot because they lacked 
sufficient nominating petitions 
but the us supreme courts ruling gives harold washington 
party attorneys 90 days from oct 12 to file formal appeals well 
beyond the nov 6 election date the high court will decide later 
whether to hear the case

the california supreme court refused 
thursday to prohibit a death sentence for a former winery worker 
accused of killing seven people and trying to kill three others 
ramon salcido 29 is accused in the slayings including six 
family members during a series of bloody attacks in californias 
wine country last year 
salcido faces seven counts of murder and three counts of 
attempted murder the case went to the jury wednesday and 
deliberations continued thursday 
the supreme court refused a defense request to intervene in the 
case and prohibit a death sentence jurors could recommend the 
death penalty if they find salcido guilty of multiple firstdegree 
murders 
salcidos lawyers had argued their client was removed from 
mexico by a subterfuge intended to evade the usmexico 
extradition treaty 
that treaty lets mexico which has no death penalty for murder 
deny extradition if the fugitive could be sentenced to death in the 
united states 
in court papers public defender marteen miller said mexican 
officials were deceived into releasing salcido into us custody 
without formal extradition after he was arrested in mexico four 
days after the killings 
the law enforcement agents of sonomacounty sought to evade 
the effect of these treaty provisions by intentionally misleading 
the mexican authorities into falsely believing that salcido was 
an american citizen and expelling him miller wrote 
those arguments were rejected earlier by superior court judge 
reginald littrell who is presiding over salcidos trial in san 
mateo county 
the proceedings were moved from sonoma county because of heavy 
pretrial publicity 
salcido is accused of shooting his wife angela 24 and cutting 
the throats of their three young daughters two of whom died in 
april 1989 
he also is accused of stabbing to death his motherinlaw 
marian richards 47 killing her two daughters and fatally shooting 
his coworker tracey toovey 35 
he faces three counts of attempted murder for attacks on his 
surviving daughter another coworker kenneth butti and buttis 
wife terri

two men cited for holding hands in a parked 
car were cleared by a judge but the american civil liberties union 
said thursday it is appalled that the incident even occurred 
its entirely offensive it would be offensive to any 
civilized person that theyre police doing this said jim 
rogers aclu coordinator for southwestern ohio 
hamilton county municipal judge joseph luebbers heard legal 
argument and testimony wednesday before dismissing the charges 
against commedore c canyon 29 of cincinnati and john k harden 
28 of ludlow ky 
i see this as a direct violation of freedom of association 
for two individuals not to be able to sit and talk rogers said 
if these two gentlemen hadnt had the nerve to resist this 
prosecution this kind of harassment might have continued to take 
place 
im just glad its over because we didnt do anything 
wrong canyon said wednesday 
im pleased that justice was served because we didnt do 
anything wrong harden said thursday 
defense lawyer catherine adams argued that the charge 
disorderly conduct for creating a physically offensive condition 
was unconstitutional she said it fails to specify what sort of 
conduct society considers acceptable or illegal 
what is a physically offensive condition who knows what that 
means ms adams asked that doesnt put anybody on notice as 
to what that means there are all sorts of things that are 
offensive from picking your nose to god knows what 
police officer marty polk found the men holding hands in a 
parked car sept 27 in eden park 
the men said they had known each other six years and that canyon 
was consoling harden over a death in his family when they were 
cited the two are homosexuals but are not romantically involved 
said lawyer scott knox an associate of ms adams 
polk testified that the fact both were men did not make the act 
offensive he said the situation would have been as offensive had 
it involved a man and a woman 
ms adams said the two men were cited three days after activists 
protested at the hamilton county courthouse as the contemporary 
arts center and director dennis barrie went on trial on charges of 
displaying obscene photographs by robert mapplethorpe at issue 
were seven photos showing sexually graphic acts involving men and 
two children with their genitals exposed 
barrie and the center were acquitted of all charges 
mapplethorpe 42 who was a homosexual died in 1989 of aids 
the activists who protested sept 24 accused police and prosecutors 
of harassing homosexuals 
i really believe that this citations happened because of the 
atmosphere generated by the mapplethorpe case and the mapplethorpe 
demonstration ms adams said 
ed ammann assistant police chief denied the allegation 
thursday saying police enforce laws not harass homosexuals 
i dont think it was a harassment kind of thing ammann 
said the officer believed he had a disorderly conduct case so 
he placed the charges there is no attempt to increase 
enforcement in the area of homosexuals 
ms adams said the law prohibiting disorderly conduct for 
creating a physically offensive condition had been in effect since 
jan 1 1974 but she said her research turned up no published case 
in ohio in which the law had been the basis for a prosecution the 
maximum penalty for conviction is a 116 fine 
rogers said the aclu does not plan to file a protest but will 
monitor to see if there is evidence of harassment against the gay 
community 
its an enforcement of the statute in a definitely 
unconstitutional manner rogers said 
we all have a right of association two people man and 
woman woman and woman man and man are allowed to sit and comfort 
each other he said

a vietnam veteran who said he was a victim 
of war stress was convicted thursday for a second time of the 1981 
rapekidnap of a woman who disclosed her identity in frustration 
over years of delay 
god yea said victim sue kremelberg 35 her fists raised 
in the air after the verdicts were read she and her family then 
hugged in the courtroom 
robert percy 39 was accused of raping kremelberg in 1981 while 
out on bail after raping an essex attorney susan sweetser just 
weeks earlier 
in both cases percy was convicted of rape in his appeals of 
both cases the vermont supreme court overturned the convictions on 
procedural errors and sent them back for retrial 
the sweetser rape led to a second conviction in 1988 and last 
month the high court upheld the verdict 
for years kremelberg and sweetser have had to return again and 
again to court to recite the stories of their rapes outrage over 
those experiences prompted them to go public with their cases this 
summer 
they shed the anonymity customarily shrouding rape victims 
hoping to provoke changes in a complex and sluggish judicial system 
they say favors defendants 
percy who blamed his crime on his stressful legacy from combat 
in the vietnam war can still appeal this verdict to the vermont 
supreme court 
his lawyer didnt say whether an appeal would be made 
percys conviction thursday of sexual assault kidnapping armed 
robbery and committing a felony while carrying a concealed weapon 
will add to his current sentence of 18 to 20 years for raping 
sweetser he was eligible for parole in 1994 
sentencing in the kremelberg case is expected within the next 
few months sweetser called thursdays verdict gratifying im 
both pleased and relieved she said after learning of the 
verdict im happy for all the women of vermont 
state attorney general jeffrey amestoy predicted the womens 
public complaints would yield improvements in the states justice 
system he also intends to propose changes to the legislature in 
january 
the kemelberg and sweetser cases are significant beyond the 
particular cases because they are symbolic of some problems in 
vermonts criminal justice system amestoy said these cases 
have put a face on the problem 
first and foremost we need an amendment to vermonts 
constitution to clearly establish the authority of vermont judges 
to deny bail when the defendant poses a danger to the public he 
said 
he also will push for a way to speed up the vermont supreme 
courts review of appeals and will propose legislation mandating a 
minimum 15 years to life in prison for anyone convicted of three 
violent felonies 
percy did not admit to raping either woman but his lawyers did 
not deny the rapes occured arguing that percy was insane at the 
time because he suffered from a posttraumatic stress disorder 
percys lawyer james dumont said in closing arguments 
wednesday that percy was wounded in the brain by his vietnam 
experience 
but prosecutor phillip cykon countered that percy was in control 
of his actions 
the defendant was acting in a way that was his continuing 
antisocial behavior they were the actions of a defendant who was 
in control cykon said 
kremelbergs ninehour ordeal the night of jan 16 1981 began 
when she stopped at a gasoline station where percy was working 
percy told her to back her car to the air pump because her left 
tire looked low there percy jumped into the car and forced 
kremelberg at gunpoint to drive away he tied her up and raped her 
twice

ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota 
the resolution does not provide any reparations to the 
descendants or declare the remote site a national monument as the 
wounded knee survivors association had requested 
no money is spent by this measure said rep tim johnson 
dsd who called the apology a long overdue measure 
the resolution passed by voice vote 
the resolution said congress acknowledges the historical 
significance of this event as the last armed conflict of the indian 
wars period and hereby expresses its deep regret on behalf of 
the united states to the descendants of the victims and survivors

century on the circumstances surrounding wounded knee and the toll 
of dead and injured 
according to the resolution 350 to 375 indian men women and 
children of chief big foots band of minneconjou sioux were killed 
at wounded knee

the pastor of a rural church may have 
broken state laws by banishing a blind associate to the back of the 
church with his guide dog and posting beware of the dog signs 
an official said thursday 
associate pastor le roy singleton used to sit in the pulpit of 
mount zion ame church during services 
but when singleton was declared legally blind and got a guide 
dog last month the rev ellsworth l coleman barred singleton from 
the church singleton 62 was allowed to attend services sunday 
but he was forced to sit in a back pew with his dog 
it appears there may well be a problem said fred silverman 
delawares chief deputy attorney general our office would be 
glad to speak with him the human relations commission would be 
happy to speak with him 
the church has large red beware of the dog signs on each 
door said earlene a hughes president of the delaware branch of 
the national federation of the blind 
hughes said state law allows guide dogs in public places with 
their masters 
rev coleman told me i was choosing a dog over god 
singleton said i told him the dog was my eyes and god wouldnt 
see it that way 
coleman has an unpublished home telephone number and calls to 
the church about 20 miles south of dover went unanswered 
thursday 
a member of the congregation said coleman cited a biblical 
passage to support his contention that the dog should not be 
allowed to sit at the front of the church 
the passage from deuteronomy 2318 says thou shalt not bring 
the hire of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the 
lord thy god for any vow for even both these are abominations unto 
the lord thy god 
the guide dog digby sat quietly through sundays services 
singleton said 
there was singing clapping and praising and the dog did not 
interrupt the services he said he was a perfect gentleman

and an entourage of 65 at a posh hotel residents say the royals 
are wearing out their welcome 
in the latest of several incidents north cambridge residents 
complained security forces with the prince turki bin abdul azizs 
entourage ejected local children from a park during royal family 
visits 
they also claimed the saudis drove stretch limousines across 
newly seeded athletic fields 
prince turki a brother of saudi arabias king and the countrys 
former deputy defense minister arrived at cambridges charles 
square hotel in early august for a visit to harvard university 
but the prince says he has stayed to monitor us response to 
the crisis in the middle east 
cambridge city councilor edward cyr said he will ask the council 
to respond to the incident at the park 
once they drove their limousines into the park and almost ran 
people down then went up on the athletic field cyr told the 
boston globe 
cyr said wednesday he will ask the council to issue a formal 
reminder to the princes group that nobody will be allowed to 
essentially usurp a public facility for their exclusive use 
mayor alice k wolf said she has fielded complaints from 
residents that the princes limousines have made it harder to park 
in an already congested part of the city 
earlier this month harvard university police reduced its 
participation in the 24hour guard protecting prince turki 
we dont want to abandon the family but with the advent of 
the school semester weve been trying to phase it out said 
harvard police chief paul e johnson hopefully hes going to be

publicity

endowed a harvard medical school professorship in immunology the 
princes fatherinlaw has been treated in boston by a 
harvardaffiliated physician following a kidney transplant

soul to the devil for a milliondollar professorship

the prince who claimed 10 years ago they were being held as slaves 
the crimson also cited a 1989 incident in london when two german 
nursemaids hired to care for the princes three children dropped 
notes from a sixthstory hotel window saying they were being held 
hostage

physically threatened by royal bodyguards 
no charges were filed in any of the incidents

protesting taxi drivers blocked bridges 
in this capital city thursday and others lined up for miles to fill 
up their tanks after officials announced gasoline price hikes of up 
to 70 percent 
the government said it is increasing the prices beginning 
friday because of a shortfall in soviet oil supplies the higher 
prices also reflect the loss of imports from iraq under the 
unordered embargo for its invasion of kuwait 
prices are to go up by 65 to 70 percent currently the highest 
grade of gasoline costs about 230 a gallon with the price 
increase it will cost about 4 a gallon a government spokesman 
said 
hundreds of private taxis joined the protests in budapest and 
the eastern city of debrecen the state mti news agency reported 
taxi drivers angry over the new prices barricaded bridges that 
link the buda and pest sides of the capital spanning the danube 
river the news agency said 
the taxi protest on the bridges halted traffic from one part of 
town to the other many hungarians live on one side of the danube 
which cuts through the capital and work on the other 
other drivers lined up for several miles to fill their tanks 
before the new prices come into effect snarling traffic in the 
capital 
about 600 private taxi drivers gathered late thursday in front 
of parliament they demanded that the new prices be revoked saying 
the increases threaten their livelihood mti said 
transport minister csaba siklos who came out of a cabinet 
session to talk to the protesters said the government could not 
revoke the decision because it lacks any reserves to cover the 
current price of crude oil mti reported 
hungary has so far put off an increase in gasoline prices 
czechoslovakia and other east european countries have raised prices 
the past month because of the shortfalls in soviet oil 
the problem has been compounded by the persian gulf crisis many 
east european countries had barter contracts with iraq but baghdad 
cannot deliver that oil under the embargo for its aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
the last price increase in hungary was in midjuly when 
gasoline prices rose by about 20 percent 
because of the reduced deliveries of soviet oil hungary has had 
to buy oil on the world market spending scarce hard currency 
mrs katalin kardos the spokeswoman for the ministry of 
industry and commerce told reporters thursday that the soviets are 
charging hungary 17 a barrel but shipped only about 700000 tons 
in the last quarter 
she said hungary needed to buy another 700000 or 800000 tons 
at worldmarket prices for the same period 
the soviet union for years the main supplier of subsidized oil 
to hungary and its east eropean neighbors has been unable to 
fulfill quotas it will begin demanding convertible currency for 
the oil starting next year

a salvadoran colonel on 
thursday denied allegations by a us military adviser that he knew 
about threats against six jesuit priests 10 days before they were 
massacred by an army death squad 
col carlos aviles called us army maj eric buckland crazy 
for making the accusation 
the allegation is contained in an affidavit buckland gave the 
fbi in january us officials waited until this week to turn it 
over to the salvadoran judge investigating the massacre 
this new information that we should have had 10 months ago 
really complicates our work said one court source he said it 
would delay the prosecution of col guillermo benavides and seven 
other soldiers charged with the murders 
rep joe moakley dmass revealed the existence of the 
affidavit last week he also said buckland later recanted this 
testimony 
moakley who heads a congressional commission following the 
jesuit investigation blamed us embassy officials in el salvador 
for withholding the affidavit alleging prior knowlege by the high 
command 
in withholding this information the us embassy has acted in 
a dirty way if they hide something it is for a reason said 
father jose maria tojeira the jesuit provincial for central 
america 
embassy spokeswoman pamela coreyarcher said the state 
department has ordered all embassy officials to refuse comment on 
the affidavit 
it was other testimony by buckland that aviles had told him 
benavides ordered the killings that broke the case and led to the 
arrests of benavides and the other soldiers 
at the time of the slayings buckland was stationed in el 
salvador as an adviser to a unit headed by aviles 
court sources said the new affidavit says col rene emilio 
ponce then chief of staff and now defense minister sent aviles to 
try to calm down benavides in early november 
bucklands affidavit says ponce was worried because benavides 
then head of the military college had been telling other officers 
he was going to harm the jesuits buckland said he went to the 
military college with aviles but was not present when the two 
officers spoke 
it is totally false aviles said in a telephone interview 
the only explanation for these statements is that buckland is 
completely unstable emotionally 
he is crazy aviles said he claimed he was not even in the 
country in early november he said he was in new orleans between 
oct 31 and nov 14 
ponces office said the defense minister was not available for 
comment 
the priestprofessors wer among central americas leading 
intellectuals they advocated a negotiated settlement to the 
conflict and social change in el salvador and for this reason 
many rightwingers hated them 
on nov 16 army troops roused them from their beds at central

authorities charged the former chief of the 
national police on thursday with plotting to overthrow the 
government of president guillermo endara 
attorney general rogelio cruz in a letter to the chief of the 
technical judicial police leslie loaiza said former col eduardo 
herrera was being charged with threatening state security 
herrera led the reorganization of panamas military in the wake 
of the dec 20 1989 us invasion that overthrew former strongman 
manuel noriega but endara retired him in august and the 
government now says herrera is linked to a group that opposes us 
intervention in panama 
herrera was detained wednesday upon returning from a private 
visit to peru if convicted he could face up to 20 years in prison 
although a sentence of such a length would be unlikely 
herrera has denied the allegations his attorney rafael 
rodriguez told reporters that us citizens had offered bribes in 
exchange for testimony implicating herrera 
the government announced last week that herrera had ordered 
members of the national police to carry out bombings and attempt to 
seize army barracks 
the government said he was also linked to underground 20th of 
december movement which takes its name in protest from the date 
of the us invasion of panama last year the government this week 
said it had uncovered two training camps for the guerrilla group 
which it said had about 225 members

moslem mosque the bharatiya janata party supports the plan and 
the government has vowed to stop it until the matter is heard in 
court

assured votes the bharatiya janata party and the congress party 
hold a majority of votes between them 
congress party spokesman vithal n gadgil said his group was 
willing to support any leader besides singh chosen by the 
governing national front coalition if the coalition cant come up 
with an alternative the congress would stake a claim to form the 
government the spokesman said 
most analysts say elections are likely next year regardless of 
the immediate outcome 
the bharatiya janata party withdrew its support for singhs 
minority government after the arrest tuesday of its leader lal 
krishna advani during a crosscountry crusade to replace the 
mosque with a hindu temple

a man who killed and mutilated his 
girlfriend and fed her body parts to his dogs was sentenced 
thursday to 12 to 17 years in prison 
jeffrey l van patten 33 was given the maximum sentence by 
judge harvey w moes who called the case suitable for the 
national enquirer 
i would have to look far to find something as serious as his 
conduct moes said 
van patten pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter mutilation 
of a corpse and felony firearms charges in the july 10 shooting 
death of his livein girlfriend kimberly a knight 18 
in his confession van patten said knight attacked him with two 
butcher knives so he shot her and then panicked he shot her at 
least twice burned her body dismembered it with a chainsaw and 
fed it to his four dogs 
officials said the selfdefense motive and a lack of witnesses 
and evidence caused them to drop a murder charge in exchange for a 
manslaughter plea 
prosecutor michael smith has said results of a polygraph test 
indicate van patten may have been telling the truth about the knife 
attack 
defense attorney thomas obrien saying knight had a violent 
past argued for probation on the manslaughter charge and blamed 
the mutilation on panic 
smith argued for the maximum sentence saying van patten went 
far beyond self defense for six weeks after her disappearance van 
patten claimed knight ran away after an argument 
he has shown no remorse smith said he led the family and 
law enforcement officials on a wild goose chase 
speaking softly to the judge van patten said he was scared for 
his life the night he killed knight 
i really wish i wouldnt have done it van patten said i 
know now that i did wrong

bargainers settled disputes over paring 
medicare benefits and wrestled over other cuts and tax breaks 
thursday as top lawmakers predicted passage of the broad 
deficitreduction bill supported by president bush 
none of the outstanding differences was seen as a dealkiller 
for the 250billion collection of tax increases and spending 
reductions white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush liked 
the emerging bill and that seemed to stamp out the possibility of 
any lastminute setback 
with the white house optimistic one would guess it would be 
hard to shipwreck the thing said rep bill frenzel of minnesota 
ranking republican on the house budget committee 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he expected the 
house to approve the measure friday and little trouble was 
expected in the senate later 
the package would boost the 9centpergallon gasoline tax by 
about a nickel and increase levies on alcohol tobacco and fancy 
cars as well 
it would raise from 28 percent to 31 percent the incometax 
rate on the richest americans but drop the rate paid by the 
uppermiddle class from 33 percent to 31 percent the measure also 
would reduce the deductions available to people earning more than 
100000 yearly by 3 percent and phase out their 2050 personal 
exemptions 
the plan also aims cuts at veterans farm aid and other benefit 
programs the details were subject to change in late negotiations 
white house chief of staff john sununu and richard darman 
bushs budget chief met for more than two hours on capitol hill 
with house gop members answering questions and seeking support 
sununu said that assuming final details were acceptable to bush 
republicans should support the package because it contains real 
and credible savings 
i think we picked up votes today said no 3 house 
republican jerry lewis of california i think the president will 
have substantial republican support for the package 
bargainers settled a major difference when they agreed 
informally to trim the projected growth of benefits for medicare 
participants the elderly and handicapped by 10 billion over 
the next five years officials said the figure represented the 
amount of cuts approved by the house earlier this month 7 billion 
less than the senate voted for 
under the agreement the 75 annual deductible that 
beneficiaries pay for doctors bill would increase to 100 the 
monthly premium 2860 this year would grow gradually to 4620 
by 1995 
a chief remaining disagreement over medicare involved cuts in 
payments to doctors and hospitals those reductions were expected 
to total more than 30 billion over the next five years 
negotiators worked on other disputes involving 
medicaid which helps the poor pay their medical bills 
although the program will be cut liberals wanted to provide an 
additional 29 billion for lowincome elderly people the bush 
administration was trying to reduce that figure 
tax breaks for the oil and gas industry totaling 35 billion 
over five years they are championed by senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas but opposed by the house 
tax advantages for a wide range of business activities 
including research and for individuals including educational 
benefits received from employers these items sought by the 
senate would cost 56 billion 
were still working said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
bush asked how he felt about the package said as he passed 
reporters on a morning jog feel good about it he turned away 
efforts to get him to be more specific as he appeared with 
republican congressional leaders later 
some lawmakers emphasized the remaining differences 
theres nothing the president has signed off on yet its not 
just one issue there must be two dozen important issues that 
havent been resolved senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
said after an afternoon white house meeting 
still the deal seemed solid 
fatigued after a year of relentless budget combat most 
lawmakers seemed to have abandoned their desire to fight much 
further instead they appeared ready to end congress long 
electionyear session and return home for the remaining 12 days of 
the campaign season 
the timetable is telling us we wont get as much equity in the 
package as wed like said rep dale kildee dmich who like 
many liberals would have preferred to shift more of the burden to 
the wealthy 
and many lawmakers were displeased with items they believed 
would hurt their states 
for rep richard durbin dill the problem was a provision 
forcing state and local government workers to begin paying the 145 
percent medicare payroll tax government employees in illinois and 
several other states are now exempt from that levy 
i want to vote for it but thats the killer for me he 
said 
for rep marge roukema rnj the problem was the limit the 
plan would put on tax deductions for people earning more than 
100000 annually 
this is a backdoor way of raising taxes on twoincome 
families she said 
but house minority leader robert michel rill was counting on 
about 50 house republican votes for the package that meant for 
passage majority democrats would have to produce about 170 votes 
out of their 258 members a figure leaders said they would reach

hundreds of people line up at the tsum 
department store to buy scarce rationed food at a luxury hotel 
nearby westerners with hard currency enjoy the best of food and 
wine 
long food lines reflect an economic crisis that is aggravating 
social tensions and forcing a traditionally agrarian nation to beg 
for food from the west to get through the winter 
the government has proposed a 300day moratorium on public 
rallies to keep consumer anger from getting out of hand 
diplomats in sofia said they did not expect food riots 
immediately but an energy shortage means the worst is yet to come 
the soviet union has reduced oil shipments to bulgaria and un 
sanctions have halted supplies from iraq 
at the congress in september of the governing socialist party 
the new name of the communist party some officials spoke of unrest 
or civil war 
even without civil unrest prospects are gloomy president 
zhelyu zhelev denies reports that bulgaria faces starvation but 
acknowledged recently that poverty is a fact 
food stores in sofia and other cities are virtually bare sugar 
cheese flour eggs cooking oil and detergent are rationed 
as in romania and the soviet union such ordinary items as light 
bulbs toilet paper and matches are as scarce as food 
about 500 people waited outside tsum one october morning a 
woman in her early 60s had been there all night and was near the 
head of the line 
she has a monthly pension of 10230 leva the equivalent of only 
15 at the tourist rate of exchange hundreds of thousands of 
elderly and poor people struggle to get by on much less than the 
average wage which is only 300 leva a month 
many bulgarians hunt for food instead of going to work or spend 
hours in the quest after their regular shifts 
now the whole morning will be wasted said a man in the 
line who has two children i was on duty until 1 am but i 
arrived here at 530 if i dont get back home with something 
therell be trouble in the family 
another shopper said you dont know what you are lining up 
for it may be meat but you dont know which type or when it will 
be gone its possible only half the people will get something 
maria ivanova a psychoanalyst was among the few shoppers 
willing to reveal their names 
i have to put up a sign at my consultation room saying it will 
be closed for several hours so i can go shopping she said 
ms ivanova who studied medicine in east germany said it was 
her birthday but she could not have a party because she had no 
food 
i think we wont move ahead without civil war she said 
if man suffers hunger he is ready for a revolution 
at the western chain hotel near tsum the special business lunch 
that day cost 25 
some help is arriving from the west the united states has 
shipped 100000 tons of feed corn and the german red cross donated 
baby food japan austria the netherlands and some other countries 
have promised food 
the european community has pledged 22 million worth of aid for 
next year bulgaria wants it now 
mismanagement and corruption by the rigid communist regime of 
todor zhivkov who was ousted last year are the main reasons for 
bulgarias economic troubles 
zhivkov replaced wellfunctioning cooperative farms with huge 
agroindustrial complexes for greater central control the food 
situation got worse when 320000 ethnic turks many of them 
peasants emigrated in 1989 to escape growing persecution 
industrial pollution has destroyed large tracts of fertile land 
there are chronic shortages of agricultural feed and raw materials 
for industry 
government officials say stores make shortages worse by holding 
food back in anticipation of higher prices 
using a new law police have raided department stores and other 
food outlets to find hidden supplies heavy fines are imposed on 
storekeepers who break the rules 
shortages or not the government plans to remove price controls 
and cut government subsidies under economic reforms proposed by 
premier andrei lukanov 
western financiers say they will not lend bulgaria more money 
for economic recovery unless the lukanov plan goes through

from live reports on the invasion of

all there for anyone to hear and the good thing is anyone can 
hear it 
the history in sound dating back to the 1920s is available 
through more than 3800 radio broadcasts on file at memphis state 
university 
while the collection is not the largest of its kind its 
certainly one of the most accessible unlike most radio archives 
it isnt just open to broadcasting students and researchers any 
radio fan can drop by to listen to a little abbott and costello or 
perhaps a bit of inner sanctum 
not only can you hear it if you bring an audio cassette with 
you theyll highspeed duplicate it for you said marvin 
bensman founder and chief overseer of the collection 
an associate professor of broadcast history bensman began 
putting the collection together in 1969 while working at the 
university of vermont 
his students he said had little access to early radio 
broadcasts except through such sources as the national archives in 
washington 
thats sort of ridiculous to ask a college student to pay his 
way to washington to listen to some old radio programs for a 
course he said 
from a variety of sources including former broadcasters or 
their families bensman has put more than 1200 radio hours on 
tape 
theres a 1949 pilot of gunsmoke starring mark thats 
right mark dillon and worldsaving battles between the shadow 
and various forces of evil fibber mcgee and molly build a doghouse 
or search for lost keys while j edgar hoover warns of creeping

the collection includes several hours of live coverage of the 
allied invasion of europe when the outcome of world war ii and the 
fate of the world was very much unsettled 
everyone was hanging on their radios to see were we going to 
make it bensman said 
it also includes a series of shows by dr jospeh r brinkley an 
almostgovernor of kansas who broadcast medical advice in the 1920s 
and 30s brinkley picked up the nickname goat gland doctor 
because of claims he could improve the sex lives of his male 
patients with animal implants bensman said 
he did a 90minute program where you would write him and 
describe your symptoms he would then diagnose your problem and 
prescribe to you over the air he said 
raising the ire of the american medical association and the 
federal radio commission brinkley lost his broadcasting license in 
milford kan he moved to mexico and set up a hospital straddling 
the usmexican border 
he was a real pioneer bensman said his voice is 
wonderful on the radio ive listened to the stuff and his advice 
is not bad 
a stack of 16inch recording discs of brinkleys show were 
recently found in the attic of his widow bensman said 
while academic researchers and biographers of radio 
personalities often use bensmans radio collection it can also 
come in handy for such people as the daughter of the 
silvermasked tenor 
the tenor whose real name was josh white performed on a radio 
show sponsored by a tire company in the 1920s to promote 
silvertone tires program managers staged a yearlong contest 
featuring an unnamed singer said to be wearing a silver mask 
listeners were urged to guess his identity 
whites daughter contacted bensman looking for a recording of 
her fathers voice and a performance by the silvermasked tenor 
was found on one of his tapes 
we sent a tape and she was overjoyed bensman said 
the older programs in the collection are on 16inch discs which 
can hold up to 15 minutes on each side the broadcasts are put on 
reeltoreel tapes and then on the cassettes that are made 
available to the public 
the collection continues to grow as more old programs are 
located and as modern ones are added to keep up with the evolution 
of radio 
bensman said he has a list of 60 to 70 programs he still seeks 
from the early days of radio 
when we get those we think well have every known program 
that ever appeared on the networks he said 
the sought after shows include such programs as eyes aloft 
its a program about air travel or being in the air force i 
think bensman said its hard to say nobody has heard these 
programs in years

author james conaway calls napa valley an 
american eden which turns out to be an apt description of his 
book about sex scandal and sweat among families who built northern 
californias famous wineries 
this is a real place these are real people in my book 
conaway said about his book napa houghton mifflin 2495 
i get as personal as i can because thats the way you write good 
books there are many strong characters and this is the first time 
their story has been told 
his book reads like fiction as the people behind napa valleys 
most famous labels inglenook krug schram beaulieu martini and 
mondavi come to life 
the mondavis robert and peter could be the warring cain and 
abel without the fratricide following a 1965 fist fight between 
the two brothers who ran the charles krug winery peter and the 
family fired robert who went on to start the robert mondavi 
winery 
robert mondavis two sons michael and timothy now run the 
successful operation 
everybody talked to me but ive heard that some people are a 
bit bothered by the book the author said theyre not used to 
being written about in this way they lead lives that have so far 
been unexamined 
volker eisele who has grown grapes in the valley for the past 
20 years said the book is accurate and gives a behindthescenes 
glimpse to people who arent players in napa 
ive been hearing through the grapevine that a few people are 
unhappy about how hey came out maybe it turned out to be too 
personal he said 
conaway does get past the doors and cellars of napas wineries 
spending some time in the bedrooms but tales of infidelities dont 
get much ink 
occasionally someone got into bed with someone elses mate 
but bridge was the preferred activity he says in the book 
still conaway doesnt shy away from telling about betty daniel 
who despite her mormon upbringing was often unfaithful to husband 
john daniel who inherited inglenook from his father 
john had economic muscle in the valley and twice got rid 
of bettys lovers by depriving them of jobs but there was always a 
replacement conaway writes of the daniels who eventually 
divorced 
daniel was among the old families in the lush napa valley which 
saw the first planting of grapes in the 1830s after george yount 
settled the area until then the dust and fogfilled valley some 
50 miles north of san francisco had been inhabited only by wappo 
indians 
in 1858 a german named charles krug began a napa valley wine 
business using native mission grapes german varieties were soon 
thriving in the area along with vintners such as frederick 
beringer and jacob schram 
the germanborn founders were anglosaxons with mediterranean 
delusions if truth be told conaway writes 
interest in wines of the region increased during the 1880s and 
90s when inglenook was built at the height of a silver mining 
boom along the silverado trail 
prohibition the depression and world war ii put a cork in the 
winery business some however survived newcomers such as the 
christian brothers the louis martini family and the mondavi family 
even prospered 
at that time the italian vintners didnt care as much for 
quality in wine as for quantity their product was sold in jugs 
conaway writes 
during the early 50s and 60s interest in napa valley was 
rekindled with speciality wineries starting up and decrepit 
properties being renovated 
the leaders of the latest renaissance included refugees from 
business academia and totalitarianism and some colorful 
misfits 
by the mid70s when northern california wines started beating 
french wines in taste tests napa valleys boom was on every 
winery had a tasting room and tourists many on bicycles began 
traveling valley road en masse 
enter politics 
in the last few chapters of napa conaways historical 
narrative turns into a cautionary tale about the dangers of 
overdevelopment about 250 wineries now crowd napa valley and 
nearby sonoma valley compared with just a few dozen 30 years ago 
and a touristy railroad the wine train runs through the area 
some would seek to turn the land into tourist attractions 
with the valley taking on a gloss that had more to do with money 
than with the product for which it became famous conaway writes 
in 1988 napa county supervisors approved an ordinance that 
requires wines from napa valley to be made with at least 75 percent 
valley grapes now the county is grappling with how much growth to 
allow with grape growers urging preservation as vintners push 
expansion 
i think the future is undetermined at this point conaway 
said in an interview i see napa as a kind of agricultural 
yosemite that doesnt need too much government protection but it 
should be allowed to endure

many stars suffered under the control of 
tyrannical movie bosses and tom tryon is one who still shows scars 
from working with otto preminger 
however unlike others who went through breakdowns and even 
suicide tryon emerged from the experience with a brandnew career 
as a bestselling author 
tryon served only 3 years under the legendary preminger 
starring in the cardinal a 1963 sweeping melodrama 
i had a good run says the actor turned author who made 
films for paramount pictures 20th century fox and the walt disney 
co before falling under premingers spell and i could have gone 
on but i was afraid someone was going to holler at me 
the late viennaborn preminger was best known to the public for 
portraying sadistic nazis in such films as margin for error and 
stalag 17 he was known to actors as an absolute terror who 
could reduce them to tears as he did with marilyn monroe river 
of no return and jean seberg st joan bonjour 
tristesse 
i remember the night the cardinal premiered in the paris 
opera house tryon said there was a party afterward at 
maxims everybody was out in the restaurant and jean and i were 
in a little snuggery together we had just met and we had this 
shared experience of horror that we were so anxious to communicate 
to each other 
that obscenity came in and started screaming im 
talking screaming in the middle of maxims how dare you be so 
rude i know what youre doing youre talking about me telling 
mean stories jean fled in tears 
on the second day of filming the cardinal preminger fired 
and rehired tryon within an hour tryon said that preminger 
constantly berated him during filming telling him he was a lousy 
actor and making him perform the same scene over and over again 
still slender with an actors handsomeness at 64 tryon was 
recently on the talk circuit to promote his new novel the wings 
of the morning the book has had a curious history beginning 13 
years ago when he conferred with robert gottlieb then chief at 
knopf publishers 
whats this book youre writing gottlieb inquired 
tryon replied that he had no book but that he had been 
researching the history of his hometown in connecticut where an 
ancestor had settled in 1640 for three hours tryon spun tales of 
murder intrigue and feuds tom i want that book gottlieb 
concluded they reached an agreement for the historical novel and 
another book the price 2 million 
the author plunged into the story and four years later produced 
a 5580page tome but gottlieb wanted more tryon wrote on 
interrupting for other books gottlieb left knopf for the new 
yorker but the new regime remained patient as the saga grew to 
three then four books the wings of the morning is the first 
of what is called the kingdom come quartet 
tryon was well into his 40s before he turned to writing born in 
hartford conn and reared in wethersfield he served in the navy 
during world war ii then enrolled in fine arts at yale university 
after studying art in new york he painted scenery in the dennis 
mass cape playhouse he filled in as a centurion in shaws 
anthony and cleopatra and decided to study acting 
after a few small roles on broadway tryon came to hollywood 
under a paramounthal wallis contract that cast him in the 
scarlet hour screaming eagles and a monster from outer 
space title role walt disney hired him to star in a tv series 
texas john slaughter and the feature moon pilot 
his biggest break came when preminger cast him in the title role 
of the cardinal after another preminger film in harms 
way tryon did a few small features then drifted into tv guest 
shots 
inspired by ira levins rosemarys baby tryon tried his 
hand at a horror novel the other became a best seller and a 
movie his other books included harvest home crowned 
heads all that glitters and night of the moonbow 
tryon went through analysis to rid himself of the preminger 
demons he summed up my life is good tranquil is a good word 
for it you know i quit drinking 10 years ago and that was a 
major change in my life because i had the whole thing backward 
i thought i was drinking to cover up my nervousness but when 
i stopped drinking all the nervousness went away

it skews old madison avenue will say 
its murder he wrote on the left coast critics will say 
but tonights twohour premiere o cbs over my dead body has 
two major assets in its stars 
edward woodward formerly of the equalizer is one of the 
best actors working today and his costar jessica lundy a newcomer 
to series tv is a perfect foil for this hourlong blend of 
screwball comedy and mystery 
he plays maxwell beckett a successfulyetblocked crime 
novelist with a shadowy background at scotland yard she plays 
nikki page an obituary writer and wouldbe crime reporter for a 
san francisco newspaper 
woodward who won raves for the title role of the film breaker 
morant got emmy nominations in each of his four years in the 
equalizer as mccall the enigmatic emotionally exhausted former 
counterintelligence agent 
woodward gives us a much more complex character in max beckett 
who emerges as an entire man by turns irritable gallant 
petulant brave supercilious and maudlin its a fuller 
performance and woodward must be enjoying it 
if woodward skews toward older viewers younger viewers will 
skew toward miss lundy a new yorktrained stage and cabaret 
actress who made her film debut in the inauspicious bright 
lights big city and followed it with caddyshack ii a 
newcomer to series tv shes a real find 
her nikki rides a motorcycle and looks great in leathers but 
shes kind of vulnerable shes smart capable and can be 
blitheringly ditzy but she exudes a wholesome wellscrubbed 
sexiness that should be universally appealing 
the murder he wrote charge might come closer to sticking 
the series was created by david chisholm and william link a 
cocreator of murder she wrote beckett surely is the male 
couterpart to angela lansburys jessica 
if you expect the grim silverlighted new york fables of the 
equalizer you will be disappointed by the golden california tones 
that suffuse over my dead body it is much lighter fare 
sillier but stylish and engaging 
in tonights twohour premiere nikki witnesses the murder of a 
woman in an adjoining apartment building and intervenes the 
problem is that theres no body or evidence of a crime and the 
police arent interested 
nikki turns to max but fails to enlist his aid in investigating 
the mystery much of the first halfhour consists of her screwball 
efforts to secure his assistance 
once max is convinced of her sincerity or sufficiently 
apprehensive of this newest loose cannon in his life of divorce 
papers and writers block he joins her investigation 
they are unlikely buddies at best and slowly they reveal 
themselves to each other and the comedy of their older manyounger 
woman relationship really starts 
theres a nicely nutty sequence when nikki masquerades as an 
escort service employee to gain access to a suspect lundys 
skillful physical comedy takes the scene a couple of notches higher 
and funnier than it was written 
this brings us to the weakest aspect of over my dead body 
it is not the best written mystery series tonights premiere takes 
two hours to accomplish what other shows with large ensemble casts 
did in an hour 
tonights plotline has to do with a killer whos murdering 
prostitutes very early on the killer is revealed to us with a 
clue so broad and from a forensic standpoint so impossible that 
theres no suspense 
the clue then vanishes from the story and does not figure in 
the detectives solution of the mystery this violates a couple of 
conventions of the genre but then there is always columbo 
let it go the series potential friday night audience is not 
interested in edgeoftheseat thriller but in a comic 
suspensemurder mystery in over my dead body they get it 
 
elsewhere in television 
wonderful animation news dept warner bros and the fox 
broadcasting co affiliates underscored their ambitions for 
television cartoons and younger viewers wednesday by announcing a 
multiyear deal for three animated shows 
the best news is that one of them beetlejuice the emmy 
awardwinning series based on the 1988 warner bros movie is 
scheduled to open with 65 allnew episodes as a mondayfriday 
strip in the fall of 1991 
beetlejuice is beautifully animated and possibly the 
bestwritten saturday morning series although bobbys world on 
fox has attracted a following of blearyeyed television writers 
the other two are tazmania starring warners wonderful 
tasmanian devil for a weekly run in the fall of 1991 and 
batman based on the dc comics character with an unspecified 
release date 
warner bros excellent new tiny toon adventures is 
playfully serious about fighting walt disney studios for younger 
viewers and quality animation one tiny toon closed with a 
warner bros the end logo crashing down onto a mockup of a 
castle that bore an incredible resemblance to the magic kingdom

they are courted by brokers exhorted by 
advisers tempted by advertisements driven by hopes and encouraged 
by neighbors and coworkers but typical american investors dont 
give ground 
the radio blares out prices by the hour the newspaper compiles 
the days activities magazines proclaim the efficacy of the latest 
investing technique and a rich uncle relates how he once made a 
killing in the market 
every day in myriad ways americans are urged to take a long shot 
in stocks to play the market to seek a quick fortune to bet on a 
sure thing to get in on a deal but so to speak they keep their 
heads on their shoulders their feet on the ground their arms 
folded and their wallets in their pockets 
difficult as it might be to comprehend american households for 
years have been net sellers of corporate stocks a trend at odds 
with the popular image of investors and in defiance of the intense 
efforts of securities marketers 
true they may invest in corporate stocks indirectly through 
pension funds and mutual funds but even that trend a growing one 
usually is viewed as a safe patient conservative longterm 
approach to investing 
an employee benefits firm recently surveyed several hundred 
mostlyigious beliefs 
in 1978 two pentecostal families rushed past soviet guards at 
the us embassy and were given refuge the families who became 
known as the siberian seven stayed in the embassy for nearly 
five years before they were granted permission to emigrate

freddy krueger hates halloween 
in fact oct 31 is a nightmare for five fred kruegers who live 
in pennsylvania virginia north carolina and illinois 
its particularly tough for the fred krueger who lives in 
tobyhanna pa his house is two blocks from elm street 
no kidding fred kruegers men with the same name as the star of 
screen scream and gore are alive and well but unenthusiastic 
about the holiday that is descended from the medieval all hallows 
eve 
the prank calls and weird stares they say will be relentless 
none of the freds is maimed by scars has popout claws or even 
dons a fedora none has been accused of even one grisly murder 
unlike the prolific maniac featured in the neverending movie saga 
a nightmare on elm street but these disparities do not ward 
off pranksters 
i got some regular customers on the phone said fred krueger 
who lives in olivers mills pa and works for liberty mutual life 
insurance co 
its best to go along with them he said noting that kids 
will just harass him if he sounds mad or hangs up 
fred krueger a retired banker from charlotte nc also plays 
the demonic role but said he tries to keep it simple because he 
once scared a little girl 
she wanted to know if i was the freddy and i said yeah and 
gave her the laugh said the 75yearold retiree and then i 
said several other things and said i would be over to see her 
there was silence on the phone he recalled followed by a 
dial tone 
an understandable reaction in his most recent movie a 
nightmare on elm street dream child freddy krueger created by 
wes craver and played by actor robert englund invades the 
semiconsciousness of an unborn child torturing her mother and 
killing off her teenage friends 
probably not the kind of guy youd want to have over to the 
house unless of course youre mrs krueger 
ellen krueger who is married to the charlotte fred said her 
husband doesnt look anything like the star 
i got a goodlooking husband with blue eyes and dimples she 
said theres no resemblance 
another mrs krueger florence lives in tamaqua pa and gets 
a lot of silly calls it bothered her at first she said because 
she thought someone was playing a cruel joke by asking for her 
husband he died 28 years ago 
after she and a friend figured it out florence decided to 
counter with a trick of her own 
is freddy krueger there a caller will ask 
yes he is hang on shell reply 
then i just put the phone down and walk away florence said 
with a sinister laugh 
most of the freds and the mrs freds are goodnatured about 
their namesakes but sometimes people go too far they say 
fred krueger of norfolk va gets tons of calls according 
to his 17yearold son philip 
we get mostly little kids calling up but we did get one guy 
that said he was jason from the movie friday the 13th who said 
he was going to kill us philip krueger said 
information operators are willing to provide phone numbers of 
freddy kruegers although occasionally they express incredulity 
youre kidding right asked an operator in atlanta 
yeah right fred krueger said a pennsylvania operator 
sarcastically 
i dont believe this theres a freddy krueger listed said 
a new york city operator 
fred kruegers listed in minnesota georgia and new york could 
not be reached for comment but a heavy equipment mechanic in 
chicago who also bears the name was willing to share a favorite 
krueger memory 
the 31yearold father of two recalled a caller who asked him if 
he was freddy krueger the movie actor 
yes the mechanic replied and im going to get you 
they both laughed and the caller hung up 
another fred krueger was listed in chicago but a woman who 
answered the phone was not amused 
look lady i could care less she said before hanging up 
im tired of the prank calls

it is possible that deep in the amazon rain 
forest in south america are unknown plants that could help farmers 
grow crops resistant to insects and disease 
an agriculture department report says the vast tropical forest 
amazonia has thousands of plant species that have never been 
classified some of those might contain valuable genes that could 
help feed the world 
amazonia stretches over much of brazil its sprawl about twice 
the size of alaska 
amazonia also extends into peru colombia ecuador and 
venezuela but world attention in recent years has focused on 
brazil and that countrys use of forest resources 
the usda report describes some of the benefits of protecting the 
unknown resources of amazonia 
rain forests contain immense genetic inventories or 
biological diversity the report said although only 7 percent 
of the earths land surface is tropical rain forests they house 
over half of all plant and animal species 
amazonia is particularly rich in this diversity with at least 
20 percent of the earths bird species over 2000 species of fish 
and more than 2500 species of trees the report said at least 
8000 species of insects have been classified 
but the potential economic value of amazonias biological 
diversity is impossible to assess the report said very little of 
it has been studied and just inventorying all the species would be 
a formidable task 
one calculation is that it would take 3000 scientists 50 
years just to describe the diversity of life in the amazon the 
report said 
even so it is not hard to imagine that the economic value of 
amazonias genetic pool would be a large resource 
many tropical plants for example have evolved defense 
mechanisms against insects and diseases that might be crossbred 
into commercially valuable crops the report said in one 
notable instance an amazonian wild peanut saves american farmers 
an estimated 500 million a year by improving the resistance of 
domestic varieties to leafspot 
the report resource use and deforestation in brazils amazon 
was written by economists jan k lewandrowski of the departments 
economic research service and emily mcclain formerly with the 
agency and now at clemson university 
another argument for preserving the worlds tropical moist 
forests stems from the socalled greenhouse effect caused by 
increases in the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
tropical deforestation is said to be the secondleading source 
of carbon dioxide emissions after the burning of fossil fuels in 
the industrialized countries 
the scientific community however disagrees on both the 
existence and the consequences of global warming the report 
said hence the value of keeping carbon sequestered in tropical 
forests depends on how real and how damaging one believes this 
possible threat to be 
brazil has spent billions of dollars on developing amazonia the 
last 25 years the report said and the rate of deforestation has 
accelerated since 1980 
estimates in 1988 on deforestation ranged from 51 percent by 
the brazilian government to 8 percent by philip fearnside a 
scientist with brazils national institute of amazon research to 
12 percent by the world bank 
the report said fearnsides midrange estimate would indicate 
that an area about the size of arizona had been cleared as of 1988 
most deforestation in amazonia is the result of cattle 
ranching smallscale farming logging and road construction the 
report said also contributing to the loss of substantial tracts 
of forest are mining hydroelectric dams and urban growth 
the report said the amazon is an immense natural resource to 
brazilians and that benefits of conservation must balance against 
the countrys overall economic and social needs 
many in brazil see world pressure to reduce deforestation in the 
amazon as unjustified and say it has focused on brazil while 
largely ignoring the destruction of forests in the other amazon 
countries peru colombia ecuador and venezuela 
furthermore while the combined forest holdings of these four 
countries amount to less than half of brazils holdings the area 
being cleared each year is in sum greater than the area being 
cleared in brazil the report said 
the amount of money brazil can spend on conservation is limited 
and little help has been forthcoming from other countries for 
preserving amazonia 
even so the recent international pressure on brazil to adopt 
more environmentally sound amazon policies is evidence of world 
interest in the value of the huge rain forest 
this is a sharp change from barely a decade ago when the 
tropical rain forests were considered as reserves of land for 
additional agricultural production needed to feed a growing world 
population the report said 
but if the amazon rain forest is more important for the world in 
general than for brazil in particular then some international plan 
for paying for its preservation should be considered 
if the world is unwilling to pay for the benefits it derives 
from the amazon forest then the amount that is ultimately 
preserved will be less than is optimal from a global perspective 
the report said

matteo ricci an italian jesuit landed on this 
green dot of land off southern china in 1582 to bring the gospel to 
a new world 
he mastered chinese advised the ming emperor and brought the 
principles of geometry from the west but his dream of a catholic 
china never came true ricci died in 1614 and was buried in 
beijing 
now nearly four centuries later another jesuit hopes to change 
china 
father lancelot rodrigues 66 is a silverhaired bear of a man 
with a taste for good food and wine he and a growing number of 
other roman catholic and protestant clergy have begun working in 
china since the communist government opened its doors to the world 
in the early 1980s 
starting in 1985 rodrigues and his small group of priests and 
nuns have run training programs for more than 200 teachers of 
handicapped children in chinas backwaters 
they are setting up a rug weaving factory in a poor county of 
central anhui province and hope to build freshwater fisheries and 
other small projects in 1988 when an earthquake struck yunnan 
province rodrigues took blankets to the homeless 
last year the priest approved 140000 in funds to be used in 
china most of the money comes from western european charities 
catholic relief services of baltimore md and the us catholic 
conference 
other groups endow homes for the elderly work with the deaf and 
provide disaster relief and health care but nearly all their 
projects are in cities those organizations include caritas in hong 
kong and the amity foundation which is based in nanjing china 
but gets most of its money from abroad 
for father lancelot the countryside is the target 
this is where we should begin he said during an interview 
in his cluttered office you cant just go to the mountain and 
preach 
he and the other christians tread a fine line 
chinese authorities do not allow them to preach several 
westerners most of them christian evangelists have been expelled 
for alleged proselytizing 
the bible says by your works you will see the fruit 
rodrigues said by programs like these we can touch their 
hearts 
chinas communists have kept a tight rein on religion since 
their victory in 1949 they viewed religion as the opiate of the 
masses and the thousands of foreign missionaries as the spiritual 
arm of western imperialism 
by 1957 all religions were organized into groups controlled 
directly by the communist party 
catholics were forced to break allegiance to the pope and 
protestants compelled to sever ties with foreign churches those 
who resisted were arrested and jailed or sent to labor camps 
the policy took an increasingly radical turn during the cultural 
revolution of 196676 bands of red guards rounded up thousands of 
believers churches and temples were destroyed 
some religious freedom has been allowed since the opening to the 
west but problems remain and china does not recognize the vatican 
the union of catholic asian news based in hong kong recently 
reported the arrests of 19 priests from an underground church in 
fujian province southern china 
those arrested are ready to be martyrs rodrigues said 
they are the martyrs of the 20th century 
father lancelot said he entered the clergy because of his 
mellifluous voice which he often exercises on spanish love songs 
and irish tunes like danny boy 
he was born in malacca malaysia to a halfirish 
halfportuguese father and a mother of mixed dutch and malay blood 
his father sent the boy to macao a portuguese colony when he was 
12 to be educated by the jesuits 
ah we were rascals then always writing love poetry to the 
ladies he recalled its the rascals who enter the clergy 
young rodrigues was a favorite of the bishop of macao and 
serenaded the jesuit teachers in a clear soprano at night he 
listened to the history of the jesuits and ricci read by monks 
from an ancient book 
he delivered his first sermon soon after the chinese revolution 
of 1949 in the canidrome macaos dog racing stadium which had 
been converted to house refugees from china 
after demonstrating his ability to resettle those emigres 
rodrigues was a natural to run the territorys refugee camps when 
the southeast asian war ended in april 1975 and vietnamese started 
fleeing in tens of thousands 
at one point more than 8000 boat people were in the macao 
camps all but 250 have been resettled in the west 
hes the miracle worker of macao said a western diplomat 
based in hong kong anything he wants done somehow it happens 
rodrigues knows all levels and degrees of macao society which 
seems to have paused in the 19th century at a familyrun 
restaurant in the old part of town he pressed a point over 
portuguese white wine as the promise of garlicladen dishes wafted 
by 
rodrigues applies the same techniques in china he first 
broached the possibility of a mission over a feast with chinese 
officials from zhuhai just opposite macao 
a little good wine and good food later and we were talking 
business he said 
since then father lancelot has led missions to a dozen counties 
in four other chinese provinces 
initially officials at catholic relief services called the 
program lancelots folly and threatened to cut off the money 
now rodrigues says chinas warm reception has encouraged the 
charities 
last july he met pope john paul ii 
where do you work the pope asked 
china rodrigues replied 
ah he was jealous rodrigues told the interviewer with a 
chuckle 
on his frequent visits to china father lancelot refuses to stay 
in luxury hotels 
i only have one condition he said i must have a toilet 
and a shower 
a grin spread across his face and he called out toilets for 
china the greatest project in the world

soon after the new us ambassador 
arrived with his wife and daughter in september another embassy 
official invited them to spend a relaxing day at the beach 
relaxing while the men and their children splashed in the 
indian ocean south of mogadishu six gunmen invaded the nearby 
beach house and robbed their wives 
one of them pointed a gun at my wifes head point blank then 
moved it slightly to the side and pulled the trigger said the 
ambassador james k bishop he added with diplomatic 
understatement it was very unpleasant 
no one was harmed but the thieves escaped with the womens 
handbags 
it was another display of the nearanarchy that grips mogadishu 
as civil war in the countryside reaches closer to the capital 
its just total chaos a western aid administrator said 
civil administration has broken down almost totally the 
government is virtually in a state of collapse 
gunfire is heard in the city every night bombs explode and 
armed robbery is so frequent that nearly everyone has a tale to 
tell of an assault on his own or someone elses home 
the robberies are blamed on soldiers who are said to supplement 
their meager pay with nightly forays into residential neighborhoods 
darkened by lack of electricity 
everyone is arming themselves out of fear an aid worker 
said on condition of anonymity you can buy an assault rifle or 
pistol on almost any street corner soldiers are selling them on 
the black market 
thousands of refugees from fighting in the northern central and 
southern parts of somalia compound mogadishus miseries many live 
with family members in the city stretching household budgets to 
the breaking point 
a middlerank civil servant is paid 10000 somali shillings a 
month the equivalent of about 3 in a land where hyperinflation 
has sent the price of a beer to 2000 shillings 
we have a great tradition of sharing said mohamoud s nur 
a former adviser to president mohamed siad barre if i have 
something and you have nothing i share what i have with you its 
the only way people survive these days 
the problem is there is increasingly less to share its 
getting desperate there is real hunger in mogadishu real 
deprivation real suffering 
nur 54 is a sign of the changing times a critic of the 
government unafraid to speak openly something unheard of a few 
months ago 
he was one of 114 businessmen intellectuals civic leaders and 
clan elders who signed an antigovernment manifesto in august nur 
and 44 other alleged ringleaders were arrested and taken before a 
special court on nebulous sedition charges that could have brought 
them life in prison 
when their trial began in september however an estimated 
300000 people filled the streets of mogadishu in protest the 
judge dismissed the case for lack of evidence 
we were freed in rather unusual circumstances nur said 
nobody who has ever been brought up before this court has ever 
been declared innocent or freed for lack of evidence but in our 
case there was a general uprising and the regime had no other way 
out but to release us 
faced with the collapse of its authority almost everywhere in 
the country siad barres government promised a national referendum 
on a proposed new constitution it was scheduled for oct 23 but 
has been postponed indefinitely 
critics say the referendum is a joke because the government 
cannot conduct a vote in the vast areas it no longer controls 
siad barre also proposed discussions with critics and armed 
opponents to be held in cairo 
two of the three three major insurgent groups agreed to attend 
but hardly anyone expects reslts because the presidents enemies 
demand his departure as a first step in a solution 
the slide from instability to chaos in somalia a nation of 8 
million on the horn of africa is generally considered to have 
begun july 14 1989 
on that day siad barres security forces fired on moslems 
protesting the arrest of their religious leaders in mogadishu 
witnesses and international human rights organizations say up to 
450 people were killed 
soldiers rounded up 48 men and boys the next day took them to a 
beach not far from where the ambassadors party was robbed and shot 
them one survived 
human rights groups have compiled long lists of atrocities 
including one at a soccer stadium july 6 when siad barres 
personal guard fired on a crowd that jeered the president 
diplomats and others say 109 people were killed 
aid from the united states once one of somalias main 
supporters and other western donors has been cut drastically 
because of the abuses making an already dismal economic situation 
worse 
somalias banking system has collapsed the only 
commercialsavings bank went broke because of unsecured loans to 
siad barres relatives and friends thousands of people lost their 
money 
an insurgent group called the united somali congress which 
began fighting just a year ago has become a major threat and 
controls must of central somalia it has attacked towns and 
villages within 50 miles of magadishu in recent weeks 
the somali national movement an older group roams the northern 
part of the country and omar joss a renegade army colonel stalks 
the south with 600 to 700 men he led in a mutiny last year 
nur said his manifest group as it has become known is trying 
to unite the armed bands and other opposition into one major 
resistance 
to characterize the situation and the hopes of somalians for 
change nur paraphrased charles dickens 
it is the best of times it is the worst of times it is a 
time of great expectations

just a handful of votes president bush said 
almost wistfully and republicans could control the senate 
but it would take a full hand five seats to wrest it from the 
democrats and that target is almost certainly beyond gop reach in 
offyear elections that republicans hoped would be at minimum a 
stepping stone for 1992 
that is the more likely year for a congressional shakeup 
despite this election seasons voter wrath at a stumbling 
government and worsening economy the performance has hurt bushs 
standing but hes still not as unpopular as congress in the public 
opinion polls 
for a 1992 game plan to hold up the republicans need to add at 
least a seat or two to their 45 in the senate this year and 
theres at least as good a chance that they will lose seats 
instead 
at this point strategists in both parties expect little net 
change in the party lineups in congress a political aide to bush 
hedges the bet by saying that the white house hopes to defy history 
and beat the pattern in which a presidents party loses house and 
senate seats in offyear congressional elections 
counting that way the administration can claim to have won 
while losing 
limited losses in the house wont make a lot of difference 
given the lopsided majority the democrats hold there both sides 
anticipate democratic gains in the house probably in the range of 
a halfdozen seats the white house party has not gained house 
seats in any offyear elections since the democrats did it in 1934 
but in the senate an offyear gop loss in line with the 
historic pattern of three seats would cripple republican chances of 
converting their minority into a majority and thus gaining a piece 
of the action at the capitol during the bush presidency 
the lineup is now 55 democrats 45 republicans five seats short 
of the tie that would enable vice president dan quayle to vote the 
gop into control 
despite the improbability of it quayle said maybe well be 
lucky enough to pick up five seats and then it would be a 5050 
tie 
it would be my sheer delight to preside over a divided senate 
and to cast tiebreaking vote after tiebreaking vote for the 
programs of president george bush he added during a campaign 
stop thursday in runnemeade nj 
bush brought the subject up later thursday surrounded by the 
congressional republican leadership in the rose garden if we had 
more republicans like everyone who is standing here we wouldnt be 
in this fiscal mess 
republicans held senate majorities for six of ronald reagans 
eight years in the white house gaining control with a surprise 
dozenseat gain when he was elected in 1980 losing it in 1986 
when democrats picked up eight seats in offyear balloting 
this time position is a more realistic republican goal than 
control the nov 6 competition is for 18 senate seats now held by 
republicans 16 held by democrats gop strategists said they were 
out to establish a foundation for gains into the 1990s eight gop 
house members left safe seats to bid for the senate five of them 
against incumbent democrats the other three seeking to succeed 
retiring republicans 
bush was riding recordhigh voter approval ratings while he had 
no coattails in winning the white house his popularity looked like 
a major offyear asset his ratings slipped then slumped and 
democrats who had seemed vulnerable early in the year turned out to 
be tough at the end 
in 1992 the democrats will have 20 senate seats to defend 
republicans 14 eleven of the democrats are freshman senators and 
will be up for reelection for the first time there are likely to 
be retirements among senior democrats some with problems like sen 
alan cranstons savings and loan involvement 
but those promising circumstances wont make much difference 
unless republicans gain where history says theyll slip even then 
the 1992 strategy assumes a strong bush ticket with coattails that 
were lacking in the 1988 elections 
while he was winning the white house the democrats were gaining 
a seat in the senate they havent sustained a net loss there in 
any election since 1980

at 1252 pm on friday sept 14 doctors at 
the national institutes of health began transfusing white blood 
cells into the tiny arm of a 4yearold girl with a rare inherited 
ailment 
for 28 minutes she played with her doctors and put stickers on 
their lab coats as she helped them launch a new era in medical 
treatment 
she became the first person to receive gene therapy a treatment 
intended to compensate for the genetic defect she was born with by 
giving her normal copies of the defective genes 
news of the experiment had special interest for suzanne 
tomlinson a 27yearold woman from alexandria va 
the idea of gene therapy was always sort of far off and maybe 
a little idealistic she said it has been in the back of my 
mind that theoretically gene therapy would be the key that would 
really cure the disease 
the disease is cystic fibrosis she was diagnosed with it when 
she was 7 months old 
the 4yearold gene therapy pioneer whose name has been 
withheld has a rare immune system disorder but gene therapy holds 
promise for people with many inherited diseases including cystic 
fibrosis 
indeed recent discoveries about cystic fibrosis have made it 
one of the leading candidates for gene therapy perhaps within the 
next five years said robert beall executive vice president for 
medical affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation in bethesda md 
what we thought to be decades away is now years away said 
beall 
other potential candidates for gene therapy within the next few 
years are certain forms of anemia hemophilia and muscular 
dystrophy 
it will be at least several months before researchers know 
whether gene therapy is succeeding in the 4yearold girl many 
researchers poised to expand the applications of gene therapy say 
the experiment represents the historic opening of a new era in 
medicine 
when the experiment was approved in july gerard mcgarrity 
chairman of the national institutes of health approval panel said 
what were doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines 
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal medicine has been 
waiting thousands of years for this 
tomlinson too has been waiting her parents have long been 
active with the cystic fibrosis foundation and she works there as 
consumer affairs coordinator 
she was married earlier this year and attends law school at 
night but she still makes time to follow cystic fibrosis research 
including the severalyearlong debate over the ethics and risks of 
gene therapy 
the decision to proceed shows that society is willing to 
accept this she said criticism of the experiment was important 
because it makes people think about the seriousness of this 
work tomlinson said 
scientists worry that putting new genes into the body could 
trigger cancer or other problems and some worry about the ethics 
of altering human genetic makeup 
but i dont want to see them the critics stop it 
tomlinson said i dont want their fear of the unknown to hold us 
back 
last summer researchers found the gene that is defective in 
people with cystic fibrosis and this year they showed that the 
defect could be corrected in the test tube 
the next experiment will be to try to insert the normal cystic 
fibrosis gene into mice and then try again in larger animals such 
as sheep beall said 
then human experimentation could begin because the most 
important symptom of cystic fibrosis is the accumulation of mucus 
in the lungs an aerosol spray that delivered genetically 
engineered cells to the lungs might be all that is required for 
most patients 
tomlinson has a mild case of cystic fibrosis she follows a 
physical therapy regimen every morning to dislodge mucus in her 
lungs and she takes enzyme pills with every meal to help digest 
her food 
several times a year she is treated for lung infections usually 
managing to avoid the hospitalizations that many people with cystic 
fibrosis undergo 
ive really been able to lead a full life she said 
as researchers scramble to finish the preliminary experiments to 
pave the way for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis tomlinson is 
uncertain what that means to her 
despite her enthusiasm she isnt sure shell volunteer to be 
one of the first to try the new treatment 
i want to be sure it works she said i used to do more 
research but now because theres so much going on in my life and 
im healthy i guess im more skeptical

the radio goes silent as stations drop out 
of range 
ghostly sand dunes with cliffs that look like the jagged end of 
a broken bone whip by the cars windows 
grit gets in the mouth the hair the eyes only bunch grass 
holds the sand down there are only a few short evergreens rolling 
hills cattle telephone wires and highway 
onequarter of nebraska about 19000 square miles is made up 
of this mysterious sand once thought uninhabitable now a major 
source of the states cattle revenue 
its the largest sand dune area in the western hemisphere and 
one of the worlds largest grassstabilized dune regions 
the nebraska sandhills stretch from south dakota to north platte 
and from alliance in the panhandle to neligh in the eastcentral 
part of the state 
there are oases small lakes burst out of the ogalala aquifer 
a stretch of underground water that spreads from south dakota and 
wyoming into new mexico and texas 
the niobrara snake loup and dismal rivers cut through the 
land at the edge of the sandhills the states largest reservoir 
lake mcconaughy sparkles in the sun 
stories abound about the sands origins 
ive heard everything from they were formed out of a giant 
lake to they were deposited out of glaciers out of the ice 
age said jim swinehart research geologist at the university of 
nebraskalincoln 
recent studies indicate the dunes formed out of windblown 
deposits from rivers that moved across nebraska and then dried up 
5000 to 10000 years ago he said 
precipitation increased and grass stabilized the dunes until 
about 3500 years ago when they dried up once again about 1500 
years ago precipitation increased and the dunes stabilized again 
with minor periods of drought he said 
there is concern that any warming of the earth such as the 
greenhouse effect could return central nebraska to a desert with 
moving sand dunes swinehart said 
some say that in less than 50 years we might return to dry 
conditions swinehart said pretty soon dunes would be over 
the roads blocking the rivers 
us geological survey crews are studying areas of the great 
plains including the sandhills that are susceptible to wind 
erosion mapping and soil sampling should help scientists determine 
how dry it has to get before vegetation begins to die geologist 
chris schenk said 
for now there is just enough precipitation in the sandhills 
23 inches a year in the east to 17 inches a year in the west to 
keep more than 498000 head of cattle fed 
figures compiled for jan 1 showed 17 million beef cows in 
nebraska fourth in the country behind texas missouri and 
oklahoma said jack aschwege a statistician with the nebraska 
agricultural statistics service 
cash receipts for cattle and calves in nebraska in 1988 totaled 
44 billion 55 percent of the state receipts for agriculture 
aschwege said 
the sandhills have been over time renowned for its good cattle 
grazing capabilities said dennis findley of the texas 
agricultural statistics service 
its real cowboy country theres no question about that 
said charles flowerday coeditor of the book the atlas of the 
sandhills 
its the kind of place where you see certain hallmarks of the 
late 19th century flowerday said rounding up cattle on 
horseback separating out calves and branding them 
but alongside these are harbingers of the 21st century 
satellite dishes personal computers to manage ranches electronic 
marketing 
ranchers are largely responsible for keeping the land alive 
flowerday and others said measures such as controlling prairie 
fires and avoiding overgrazing have even improved the land they 
said 
its good ranching country but you have to treat it with 
respect or the sand will start to roll said chet paxton an 
81yearold rancher who lives in thedford in the heart of the 
sandhills 
paxtons parents moved to the area when he was 2 and soon 
learned farming wouldnt work the paxtons now own 1500 head of 
cattle on 25000 acres of land 
it was rough paxton said of the early days mother was 
used to missouri and a lot of timber she felt real bad about the 
barren land 
but paxton and others persevered 
the sandhills werent always known as good ranch country early 
ranchers and farmers approached the forbidding edge and ventured no 
farther afraid of the land and of indians 
in 1795 james mackay led an expedition for the frenchowned 
upper missouri co his impression a great desert of drifting 
sand without trees soil rock water or animals of any kind 
excepting some little varicolored turtles of which there are vast 
numbers 
reviews did not improve soon 
in 1855 lt gk warren a topographical engineer with the 
army followed the middle loup river through the heart of the 
region he wrote 
we found the impracticability for almost any purpose so 
marked that it seems like a great waste of time to have made the 
exertion we have our greatest wish is to get away from it as soon 
as possible and never return 
but by the late 1870s ranchers were moving in stories vary but 
one heard often is that cattle drifted into the hills during a 
blizzard ranchers searching found not only the lost cattle but 
large herds that had been there for years and were well fed and 
watered on the native grasses and many small lakes

mullen population 552 is the only town in 
hooker county which itself has only 788 residents and thats 
quite enough thank you 
its a small town and there aint much here but it beats 
living in the city said edith cash who cooks at big reds cafe 
mullen has two restaurants a bowling alley a twoblock main 
street and a bank the library and the courthouse sit sidebyside 
sand dunes separate mullen and other small towns such as 
whitman in neighboring grant county 
windmills cattle and huge ranches mark the forbidding land once 
thought uninhabitable 
weve traveled quite a bit and never have seen better ranch 
country said earl monahan 90 who lives about four miles off 
highway 2 near hyannis 
i was born right up here about 50 yards monahan said 
pointing from his den to some unseen spot behind him its kind 
of a flat place 
few people are certain how much land monahans family works at 
the circle dot ranch he says he runs enough cattle to graze the 
grass off the land and has enough land to graze the cattle 
monahan and other residents speak about the area with an 
affection rooted in practicality monahan knows how to fence his 
cattle to provide shelter from storms he often worked 12 hours a 
day seven days a week 
friendly people a good environment for raising children and a 
smalltown atmosphere are the most important elements of life in 
the sandhills said thedford board of trustees chairman albert 
fisher 
basically all our houses are full for working people its 
about the same town as it was in 1980 fisher a field technician 
for consolidated telephone co said but nowadays people have 
smaller families 
preliminary 1990 census figures indicate thedford one of three 
towns in thomas county has a population of 232 compared with 313 
in 1980 
the census figures indicate mullens population has dropped from 
720 in 1980 to 552 and hooker countys population has declined 
from 990 to 788 
a dentist comes to mullen twice a week there is a clinic but 
the closest hospital is 75 miles south in north platte there is a 
high school and a grade school but some students travel 40 miles 
each way 
i guess when you decide to live here you dont worry too much 
about that because you know what the situation is said dick 
macke who grew up in the area coowns a grocery store and heads 
the village council 
besides said fisher you kind of get the sand in your blood 
and it stays there

if it looks like a wolf howls like a wolf 
and leaves tracks like a wolf is it really a wolf 
dale wondercheck biologist at the rogue river national forest 
wants to trap one this winter to find out whether the endangered 
gray wolf is moving back into oregon or people have been turning 
out wolves and wolfdog crosses they could no longer keep as pets 
its like hunting bigfoot said wondercheck except there 
are a lot more sightings too many for them to be discounted as 
kooks what we do know is people are seeing some large canines out 
there 
the last confirmed wolf in oregon was killed in 1946 at the 
umpqua national forest bill haight of the oregon department of 
fish and wildlife said 
the packs of wolves that once roamed the northwests plains and 
mountains were hunted with a vengeance from 1915 to 1929 to keep 
them from preying on livestock 
though gray wolves survive in the northern rocky mountains and 
have recently moved into washingtons northern cascade range canis 
lupis was generally believed to have been wiped out in oregon 
the state isnt even included in the us fish and wildlife 
services recovery plan though it is part of the wolfs historic 
range said an on oct 1 which will allow it 
to continue a high level of resolutions said peter h monroe 
the president of the oversight board 
if the rtc meets its target of 192 new resolutions it will 
have sold or closed approximately 90 percent of all thrifts seized 
by the rtc to date monroe said 
it is important for the rtc to move forward with these 
resolutions and to continue to accelerate the pace of asset sales 
which should only be enhanced by our recently issued policies on 
securitization and seller financing he said 
the oversight board sets policy approves the financing and 
provides general oversight supervision for the resolution trust

most of america may not be distressed by 
government warnings to avoid homemade mayonnaise because of fears 
that the raw eggs it contains could cause food poisoning 
but to people like harold mcgee who writes about kitchen 
science and lore something clearly had to be done 
mcgee in a letter published in the oct 25 edition of the 
journal nature said he had tested mayonnaise and other yolkbased 
sauces made by first boiling the lemon juice or vinegar and yolks 
in a microwave oven before adding the oil 
the reason i published that article is to advise the public 
health authorities mcgee said from his home in palo alto calif 
my hope is that it will encourage the centers for disease control 
and the food and drug administration and people like that to test 
it 
the us department of agriculture advises that eggs must reach 
an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees to be considered free 
of salmonella bacteria this means the yolk and the whites have to 
be firm the usda said 
according to the american egg board the risk of a 
salmonellainfected egg is one in 10000 at home in restaurants or 
cafeterias the risk increases because so many eggs are used at 
once and one could contaminate a bowlful 
one of the things that really got me to thinking about it was 
reading the paper and seeing a recipe from a distinguished french 
chef for aioli calling for storebought mayonnaise because he said 
he just couldnt recommend the homemade mcgee said i thought 
there just had to be a way of getting around it 
chef julia child has developed a mayonnaise using cooked eggs 
which she said is very easy to make and youd never know the 
difference barbara kafka author of microwave gourmet and the 
microwave gourmet healthstyle cookbook has developed a recipe 
for an eggless garlic mayonnaise 
once mcgee author of on food and cooking and the curious 
cook had a recipe he liked he hauled his microwave oven to a 
lab at stanford university for tests 
the experiments really showed that you can start with 5 
billion bacteria in a single egg yolk and have none at the end 
because the yolks reach or come very close to the boiling point he 
said 
acids the lemon juice or vinegar also help kill bacteria 
but only over a period of hours to days mcgee wrote in nature 
under suitable biochemical and thermal conditions egg yolks can 
be boiled without curdling them or fatally compromising their 
ability to produce smooth stable emulsions 
the microwave really works like a charm for this it works so 
much better than the stove top mcgee said its the first 
thing ive come across where its just perfect 
mcgee tried his handiwork on unsuspecting friends who couldnt 
tell the difference between it and mayonnaise with raw yolks he 
said he even had a hard time distinguishing them in a blind test 
the strong cooked egg flavor people expect is absent because it 
actually comes from the whites he said 
but kafka who tried mcgees method said she had to use 1 cups 
of olive oil to tone down the cooked lemon taste 
is it a mayonnaise to kill for no but it does work she 
said 
it is however mayonnaise that wont kill said bruce stocker 
of stanford in whose lab the tests were done the cooking method 
destroys the salmonella bacteria he said 
the test mayonnaise was not tasted because of safety rules in 
the laboratory stocker said 
and he hasnt made it at home im not a mayonnaise maker 
myself but i think its a good contribution im not much of a 
cook he said 
kay engelhardt test kitchen supervisor at the egg board said 
i dont know how many people make their own mayonnaise i dont 
think its a critical situation

a blood vessel disease in the brain that attacks 
mental abilities also frequently alters personality a study 
suggests 
the personality changes appear not to be due simply to 
intellectual deterioration researchers said 
the study focused on multiinfarct dementia which may cause 
about 20 percent of cases of progressive loss in mental faculties 
among the elderly it results from obstructions in blood flow to 
parts of the brain 
the study included 20 male patients whose average age was about 
70 researchers asked a wife or daughter who was acting as 
caretaker to fill out a questionnaire about personality changes 
since the disease began 
results said the patients had become less energetic practical 
mature enthusiastic happy selfreliant generous stable mature 
and talkative and become more cruel and unreasonable 
no change occurred in affection caution fondness of company 
irritability excitability or temper 
a comparison group of 30 healthy elderly men showed no 
significant personality changes due to retirement as assessed by 
their wives 
knowing about personality changes may alleviate some distress in 
multiinfarct patients and their caregivers said the researchers 
from the school of medicine at the university of california los 
angeles and the west los angeles veterans affairs medical center 
their study is published in the fall issue of the journal 
psychosomatics

100000 units are being used by athletes and teams 
studies published in the journal physician and sportsmedicine 
and the new zealand journal of sports medicine indicate excellent 
correlation between readings obtained by wireless monitors and 
hospital hardwire monitors 
dr kenneth cooper director of the aerobic center in dallas 
says the units are valuable for cardiac rehabilitation programs in 
which the exercisers have to know when theyve reached their 
optimum heart rate 
a dutch sports medicine expert dr peter gjm janssen in his

high jet fuel costs are accelerating the 
cutbacks and asset sales now reshaping the nations airlines and 
the industry that emerges may disappoint many travelers 
we probably will see some constriction of the air service 
available to the american public unless we see fuel prices fall 
robert j aaronson president of the air transport association of 
america said wednesday 
sustained jet fuel prices at 125 per gallon or more would 
require the total restructuring of an industry aaronson said 
at a news briefing 
in that scenario service could be cut back in smaller markets 
and fewer flights in general could make it harder for business 
travelers to plan sameday roundtrips to many destinations 
many business people would end up staying out of town overnight 
for lack of connecting flights discount fares also could become 
scarce 
such gloomy forecasts are circulating as the high price of oil 
has combined with sluggish demand for travel to deal a double blow 
to an industry that has announced the elimination of some 10000 
jobs since the invasion 
some carriers are cutting passenger capacity and selling off 
important routes as they try to shrink to sizes where they can be 
profitable 
in one of the biggest developments so far struggling pan am 
corp agreed tuesday to sell most of its prized london routes to a 
healthier competitor ual corp for 400 million 
the rising fuel cost is a catalyst for these asset 
transfers said kevin murphy an analyst with morgan stanley 
theres a whole series of asset transfers taking place from the 
weak carriers to the strong carriers 
future shakeups in the industry could be similarly speeded up 
experts said 
in addition to united analysts said the strong airlines that 
stand to gain from the industry shakeup are american and delta 
likely losers besides pan am include eastern continental midway 
and usair 
in another example of the industrys troubles continental 
airlines said wednesday it had considered filing for reorganization 
in bankruptcy court recently but opted instead to try unspecified 
alternative strategies for restoring the companys financial 
health 
aaronson said continentals troubles could just be an example 
of what other companies are wrestling with there are a number of 
carriers that are worried 
jet fuel moved from about 60 cents a gallon before iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 to more than 125 in recent weeks it has since 
dipped below 1 but the airlines realize they cant count on lower 
prices in a market being driven by rumors about the fate of the 
persian gulf standoff 
aaronson predicted more layoffs are inevitable even if fuel 
costs fall 
analysts have said the gulf crisis is pushing the industry 
toward record losses in 1990 perhaps exceeding 15 billion the 
crisis also has dimmed the outlook for next year 
we probably would have seen a moderate loss in 1991 
aaronson said it was looking like a week year now its 
devastating

normally when one of the state bank of 
countrysides better customers wants to borrow money to buy some 
property theres a pretty good chance the bank can arrange a loan 
but when the suburban chicago bank was asked recently to lend 
money to buy 40 acres of railroad property the answer was 
absolutely not 
we never knew what was coming in on those railroad cars 
said thomas p boyle countrysides senior vice president for 
lending 
so we backed away even though they were a good customer 
boyles anxiety over such a loan can be traced to a federal 
court ruling made four months ago in atlanta 
there the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled in a georgia 
case that lenders can be held liable for the costs of cleaning up 
properties that become contaminated by toxic materials 
the decision said washington attorney j kent holland jr 
turned things upside down 
with their share of cleaning up hazardous chemical sites 
potentially costing lenders millions of dollars bankers say 
theyve quicky developed cold feet about lending money for anything 
with the slightest hint of environmental trouble 
its making everybody a little gunshy about commercial 
loans boyle said 
we are considering delaying all commercial lending until we 
get environmental statements said st louis banker walter c 
branneky who like boyle was among about 50 bankers who attended 
a discussion on environmental liability this week at the american 
bankers assocaition convention 
obviously it will slow down lending said branneky 
chairman of the st johns bank amp trust co 
holland who specializes in environmental law said the 11th 
circuit found that fleet factors corp was liable as a secured 
creditor of the contaminated swainsboro ga print works property 
even though it was not involved in the handling of hazardous waste 
the court said that fleets role in the financial management of 
the facility put it in a position where it had a capacity to 
influence waste management decisions according to holland 
the 11th circuits decision has been appealed to the supreme 
court holland said 
holland said that in the wake of the court ruling the house 
the senate and the us environmental protection agency have 
launched separate efforts to limit secured creditors liability in 
such cases 
in his opinion none of the measures would go far enough 
holand said the 11th circuit acknowledged that its decision 
could discourage some investment 
i would assume thats exactly what the reaction would be he 
said 
but the court also said it would encourage lenders to pay closer 
attention to where money goes 
david j dybdahl a madison wis insurance broker who 
specializes in environmental matters said it is difficult for 
lenders to protect themselves from toxic liability most commercial 
liability policies contain pollution exemptions he said 
dybdahl managing director of environmental risk management at 
corroon amp black of wisconsin inc said there are some steps 
lenders can take to prevent becoming entangled in an environmental 
problem including a threephase site audit 
but such a process which includes a review of regulatory files 
and collecting soil samples could cost as much as 50000 
some say bankers are overreacting to the court decision a 
charlotte nc organization the southern finance project 
studied lender liability and found that only seven lenders have 
actually had to pay the epa for hazardous material damage since the 
superfund cleanup program began in 1980 
the sfp study also said that in most of the cases the amount 
paid by lenders was negligible 
holland discounted the significance of that study telling the 
bankers you do have enemies out there 
dybdahl said an environmental liability claim could be 
financially disastrous 
when you get an environmental claim its not going to be for 
500 dybdahl said its a good idea to have a preset plan of 
what to do if something happens

as tabloid entertainment the minitrial of 
michael milken has been short on bombshells and long on insinuation 
with a few salacious stories from wall streets trenches circa 
1985 
paranoid drexel burnham lambert junkbond workers run water 
faucets to drown out conversations documents burn in a fireplace 
cryptic orders are barked out possibly instructions to break the 
law 
but the special hearing on unadmitted crimes by the former 
drexel junk bond wizard has centered largely on the intricacies of 
preferred stock equity kickers and leveraged buyouts 
the hearing also has cracked a window on the most celebrated 
case of wall street crime in the 1980s offering insight into 
milkens work and raising questions about the governments heralded 
prosecution 
testimony finished tuesday on the second of three alleged 
illegal transactions presented before us district judge kimba 
wood who will use the information in sentencing milken on his 
guilty plea to six felony counts 
the government contends the unproven crimes reflect a pattern of 
lawbreaking by milken that merits a long prison stay the defense 
says milkens crimes were isolated instances of going too far to 
help clients 
after seven days of testimony by 14 government witnesses 
prosecutors havent overwhelmingly proven milken guilty of the 
systematic skulduggery described in court papers 
there has been occasional damaging testimony a charge of 
violating drexel policies and descriptions of questionable and 
possibly illegal behavior by drexel underlings but no smoking 
guns 
whether the signs of shady behavior by milken constitute what 
prosecutors have described as a pattern of calculated fraud 
deceit and corruption of the highest magnitude is for wood to 
decide 
but after four years a dropped 98count racketeering indictment 
and a case that relies on testimony by milken associates who cut 
11thhour deals to avoid prosecution milkens team so far has been 
crowing 
see i told you no bribery a defense lawyer said after 
testimony finished on one of the allegations

one sure way to gauge the mood of milkens defense team is to 
watch arthur liman 
the yodafaced lawyer with the unrelenting new york accent 
gained national attention for grilling oliver north during the 1987 
irancontra hearings disheveled and ungainly he jams his hands in 
the pockets of his buttoned jacket during questioning tie hanging 
in the breach 
while prosecutors carroll and jess fardella elicit prepared 
testimony by reading a list of questions sometimes typewritten 
liman works from notes scrawled on slips of yellow paper 
when wood rebuffs his objections as she does frequently 
liman slumps in his chair and shakes his head his line of 
questioning has caused the normally eventempered judge to lose her 
patience 
on days when liman believes the defense has done well he holds 
court with reporters schmoozing about old times with newspaper 
columnist murray kempton or answering questions other days liman 
and associates leave hastily 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the hearing carries a lower burden of proof than at a trial 
which may help the government evidence gathering is limited 
another defense hurdle hearsay by witnesses is allowed 
wood has said she is using the proceeding to gain insight into 
milkens professional character she is unlikely to pronounce guilt 
or innocence on the three transactions 
the hearing has offered a picture of life at drexel as described 
by people who until now were faceless names in the government 
probe with live evidence after four years of legal maneuvering it 
is the first chance to assess what milken did or didnt do at 
least in a few instances 
i think its completely riveting said magazine journalist 
jesse kornbluth who is writing a book on milken and the 1980s 
yes i nod out from time to time but for those who know what 
theyre looking at who know the context and the subtext its the 
best show in town

a phone call was all it took to cripple 
revlon inc the nations largest manufacturer of massmarket 
cosmetics according to a lawsuit 
a small software firm used hightech guerrilla tactic to 
repossess its product from revlon for nonpayment shutting 
down two of revlons four national distribution centers for three 
days 
revlon filed suit this week in santa clara county superior court 
against the company logisticon of santa clara 
we didnt have any remedies left as a small company said 
donald gallagher president of logisticon which has annual sales 
of less than 20 million 
revlon with annual sales of 3 billion hired logisticon last 
year to develop inventory control software for warehouses in 
phoenix ariz and edison nj 
revlon claimed the software never worked properly and on oct 9 
notified logisticon that it wanted to cancel its 12 million 
contract and would withhold further payments until the software 
worked 
a week later logisticon took its own action in the middle of 
the night using a phone link and computer access codes to disable 
all its software in revlon computers 
during this period revlon could not process inventory or 
sales orders and was unable to identify and distribute products in 
the marketplace revlon said in its lawsuit 
hundreds of revlon workers were sent home 
gallagher sent revlon a letter by fax a few hours after the 
shutdown saying he was forced into using the only leverage 
available because revlon was refusing to pay for software it had 
been using for several months 
when and if an agreement is reached on the outstanding 
payments the software systems can be restored in a few hours 
gallagher said in the letter 
revlon is seeking unspecified damages for the shutdown 
when it became obvious that the unsuccessful relationship 
between revlon and logisticon had to end logisticon and gallagher 
used their familiarity with revlons computer system to commit 
extortionate acts the suit says 
revlon wasnt able to resume operations until logisticon under 
some pressure gallagher said tuesday restored its software on 
oct 19 
gallagher described the termination as a repossession of 
logisticon software and denied allegations that his company 
destroyed any revlon data in the process 
the substance of this dispute is that a giant corporation 
revlon wrongfully is utilizing software prepared by a very small 
company logisticon and refusing to pay amounts which are 
rightfully owed logisticon said in a memo filed monday in 
superior court 
a spokesman for revlon at its new york headquarters said the 
shutdown would not cause any shortage of its products on store 
shelves 
a hearing has been set for nov 15

a 154 percent rise in midoctober sales of north 
americanbuilt autos may indicate the beginning of a shift from 
light trucks to more fuelefficient cars analysts say 
the 10 major companies making cars and light trucks in the 
united states on wednesday reported a 43 percent increase in truck 
sales pushing total vehicle sales up 113 percent 
i think car sales may be benefiting from a shift in mix away 
from trucks and toward cars said auto analyst david healy of 
investment banker barclays de zoete wedd of new york city its 
the only response i can detect to the higher gasoline prices 
since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq and the 
accompanying rocketing of gasoline prices automakers have said 
they werent seeing a shift from large gasgulping cars to 
smaller more fuelefficient cars as they saw in the oil crises of 
the 1970s 
in the 80s the popularity of trucks including compact 
pickups minivans and sportutility vehicles soared but trucks 
typically arent as economical as cars and now analysts say the 
lure of trucks may be waning 
i kind of have a suspicion that the guy who has been buying a 
truck as his primary personal transportation vehicle is opting out 
of that vehicle and moving back to a passenger car auto analyst 
joseph pillippi of shearson lehman brothers said wednesday 
he said another factor may be that cars bought in the boom years 
of the mid1980s are getting old have been paid for and are prime 
for replacement 
they are starting to age out and reach their appointed hour 
for tradein time pillippi said 
the 10 major us automakers said their cars and trucks sold at 
an average daily rate of 31328 during oct 1120 compared with 
28156 in midoctober 1989 
car sales by general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp rose 116 percent one of the biggest yeartoyear jumps of 
1990 
sales of cars made in japanese automakers us plants rose 422 
percent the big three held 848 percent of the domestically 
produced car market during the period 
the midoctober sales rate last year was depressed because 
consumers who planned to buy cars in the last three months of the 
year purchased their cars in september to take advantage of 
incentives that expired oct 1 
with only a few exceptions domestic car and truck sales this 
year have been lower than in 1989 through oct 20 sales fell 42 
percent from 1989 car sales for the year fell 46 percent and 
truck sales dropped 35 percent 
gms midoctober car sales rose 151 percent from 1989 and 
truck sales rose 75 percent combining for a 124 percent increase 
in vehicle sales through oct 20 gms car and truck sales were 
46 percent lower than in 1989 
fords 93 percent increase in car sales combined with an 114 
percent rise in truck sales for a 101 percent increase in vehicle 
sales during the period for the year fords car and truck sales 
were 86 percent behind 1989 
chryslers midoctober vehicle sales rate was 67 percent below 
1989 with a 56 percent increase in car sales offset by an 187 
percent decline in truck sales since jan 1 chryslers car and 
truck sales have fallen 143 percent from 1989

an economic slowdown aggravated by a 
persian gulf oil shock has walloped winnebago industries inc and 
the pain felt by the manufacturer of motor homes is being shared by 
its neighbors 
when winnebago is in trouble so is its home town of forest 
city says paul jefson mayor of the north central iowa community 
before layoffs began in late september the company had a work 
force of about 2600 in the community of around 4300 
as problems began surfacing at winnebago earlier this year the 
city anticipated its tax revenues would drop off its important 
that we live within the means of the city it will affect us 
jefson said wednesday 
that means no new elaborate plans for public works although a 
sewer project will proceed as scheduled he said 
the problems will get worse later this week when winnebago 
announces an austerity plan 
the company already has laid off hundreds of workers and gone to 
a fourday work week at its factories the new retrenchment will 
mean layoffs for whitecollar workers said winnebago spokeswoman 
sheila davis 
jefson says a community meeting is set for monday night to 
establish a task force to help winnebago employees 
an industry analyst said winnebago appears to be taking the 
right steps to return to profitability once the gasoline price 
outlook and the nations economic prospects brighten 
analyst michael sabbann who follows the recreational vehicle 
industry for the minneapolis investment firm of piper jaffray amp 
hopwood also said winnebago is not alone and that other 
manufacturers are in a bind 
a commerce department report wednesday said orders to us 
factories of durable goods items such as appliances and vehicles 
designed to last three years or more fell 17 percent in 
september transportation orders plummeted 68 percent 
winnebago with products that sell for around 27000 and up 
was hurting before iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and sent oil prices 
soaring it has been stung by high interest rates and an unsettled 
economic climate that sapped consumer confidence 
winnebago has reported five straight quarterly losses and had a 
record 178 million loss in the fiscal year that ended aug 25 as 
sales fell 23 percent from the previous year 
in may directors suspended semiannual dividends to 
shareholders in late september winnebago began layoffs and 
temporary factory shutdowns earlier this month it began offering 
rebates to new buyers guaranteeing to reimburse gasoline expenses 
above 1 a gallon for the first 12 months or 12000 miles of 
ownership whichever came first 
ms davis said that the rebates have not led to any noticeable 
increase in sales its a little too early to tell about the 
success of the program she said 
she said the companys flagship factory in forest city and 
smaller plants at hampton and lorimor have been on 
mondaytothursday schedules since last week with 1000 production 
workers idle each friday the fourday week will continue 
indefinitely she said 
an additional 500 workers were laid off since the end of 
september with no plans to recall them later this week an 
austerity program will be announced that will include layoffs among 
the ranks of some 800 office workers supervisors and executives 
she said 
unfortunately those are the things that have to be done 
sabbann said the whole industry cycle has turned against them 
but sabbann said winnebago is in a good position to regain 
ground once the economy improves he noted the companys claim to 
more than 60 percent of the market in sales of micromini motor 
homes a more fuelefficient recreational vehicle that has taken a 
growing share of the rv business 
robert rollefson a broker at the forest city office of the 
investment firm rg dickinson amp co and veteran winnebago watcher 
said the company is faced with its most serious challenge since the 
early 1970s thats when an arab oil embargo and the first oil 
price shock left the company with acres of unsold motor homes 
winnebago is in better financial shape today but the outlook 
now and the outlook then may be about the same he said 
the mood in town is certainly not one of joy theres a 
certain amount of despair and sadness rollefson said but after 
the initial shock people will tell you sure it will get 
better

infotechnology inc the parent of financial 
news network and united press international has named two new top 
executives to look at ways to raise cash including the possible 
sale of its businesses 
as interim cochief executives alan hirschfield and allan 
tessler will restructure the company to address fnns and 
infotechs financial problems 
cash flow at infotechnology and fnn does not cover operating 
expenses or some debts infotechnology said in a statement 
we will be considering all available options to provide 
funding needed to meet obligations and maintain and realize the 
value of the fnn franchise and of infotechs other investments 
hirschfield and tessler said in a statement wednesday 
we believe that the fundamental franchise value of the fnn 
service is substantial and should provide a basis for restructuring 
andor disposition of businesses that will enable the companies to 
meet their obligations and move forward they said 
infotechnology said it is renegotiating 207 million in loans 
for itself as well as 495 million in loans to fnn in addition 
both are trying to reschedule lease payments for 161 million worth 
of equipment 
hirschfield and tessler have been involved in several business 
restructurings infotechnology said hirschfield is a former chief 
executive of both twentieth century fox and columbia pictures 
tessler presently is chairman of international financial group 
inc ameriscribe inc and international controls corp 
the two replace earl brian who had been chief executive and who 
will continue as nonexecutive chairman of both the fnn and 
infotechnology boards 
on monday infotechnology disclosed in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission that the sec had issued a 
formal order of investigation with respect to the company under 
federal securities laws 
infotechnology spokeswoman amber gordon declined to say why the 
company was under investigation but said it was cooperating the 
sec which polices the nations securities markets does not 
comment on any investigations as a matter of policy 
gordon said the investigation was unrelated to fnns dismissal 
earlier this month of c steven bolen its chief financial officer 
fired for improper financial dealings fnns auditors deloitte amp 
touche also were dismissed 
at issue with the accounting firm was how fnn was reporting its 
28 million investment in a new service deloitte contended the 
investment should have been deducted from quarterly earnings 
which would have put fnn in the red rather than spread out over a 
period of years 
because of the dispute fnn has been unable to file its annual 
financial reports with the sec for the fiscal year ended june 30 
in addition deloitte withdrew its opinions on fnns and infotechs 
1989 financial statements 
infotechnology and fnn since have hired coopers amp lybrand 
infotechnology owns 47 percent of fnn which provides 24hour 
stock quotes business news and sports information on 3500 cable 
television systems that reach more than 35 million homes 
infotechnology also owns 97 percent of united press international 
the wire service

the government is ordering the automobile 
industry to make cars less deadly in side crashes which kill 8000 
people and seriously injure 24000 others each year 
the national highway traffic safety administration issued the 
complex regulation wednesday ending a debate among the industry 
safety advocates and bureaucrats that dragged on for a dozen years 
its been a long time coming transportation secretary 
samuel k skinner said 
the regulation is designed to prevent 500 deaths annually the 
protections it requires would lessen the severity of chest and 
pelvic injuries 
rules to protect against head injuries are being developed but 
wont be ready for two or three years said jerry r curry head of 
the traffic safety agency 
also on the drawing board are standards for light trucks and 
vans 
the new regulation drew acceptance from the industry and 
cautious praise from safety advocates 
we expect to comply fully with it said toni simonetti 
spokeswoman for general motors corp 
the nations largest automaker fought nhtsa as the rule 
developed contending the dummy used in crash tests was faulty the 
agency rejected gms plea to switch to a dummy the company 
designed 
even so gm became more supportive after a meeting last january 
between curry and robert stempel thenpresident of the company and 
its current chairman 
chrysler corp considers the regulation a positive step in the 
area of auto safety spokesman john guiniven said we know from 
our own figures that safety sells 
ford motor co spokesman robert h munson said complying with 
the rule in some cases may necessitate significant reengineering 
of our product lines the regulation may increase car weight and 
make it harder to improve gasoline mileage munson said 
the insurance institute for highway safety and advocates for 
highway auto safety said the regulation was a longoverdue first 
step but they said it would be incomplete until headinjury 
protections were added 
the changes will boost the average cars cost by about 50 a 
small price to pay for the prevention of the immense loss of life 
and suffering as a result of these side impacts skinner said 
manufacturers can choose between two timetables for phasing in 
cars that meet the standards either way all new cars must comply 
by the 1997 model year 
most probably will add padding or structural strength to doors 
and some might do both curry said 
the government will use simulated crash tests to determine which 
cars meet the standards the tests will expose cars and passenger 
dummies to conditions in the typical side collision in which a car 
traveling 30 miles per hour at an intersection slams into the side 
of another car going 15 mph 
as many as onethird of todays cars already meet the new 
standards said barry felrice the safety administrations 
associate administrator for rulemaking he estimated that 75 
percent of the remaining cars would need only door padding to 
comply

quarterly report during the summer 
morten beyer chairman of aviation consultant avmark inc 
estimated easterns atlanta operation including planes is worth 
more than 1 billion 
he said that even though twa was losing money at the 
operational level they have the financial wherewithal to do this 
and the credit 
icahn said tuesday that easterns northsouth routes would 
provide a fair amount of synergy with twas eastwest service 
based in st louis 
he said although twa is cutting back in some areas the right 
kind of growth is crucial for the airline 
if we cant grow we cant survive he said 
on wednesday martin shugrue easterns bankruptcy trustee said

and usair also have expressed interest in buying certain eastern 
assets 
he said northwest airlines pan am and twa have had discussions

congress is moving quickly to assure that 
consumers learn more from nutrition labels about what they eat but 
another food issue fish inspection is falling victim to a turf 
battle 
the senate on wednesday approved a ill on requiring food 
manufacturers to list on their labels the amount of nutrients 
calories fat and salt for most packaged foods 
claims like low salt and light would be clearly defined 
and diseaseprevention claims would have to be governmentapproved 
the bill passed by unanimous consent now goes back to the 
house which passed a similar version in late july and was expected 
to accept the senates changes 
labeling will guarantee that advertising claims are supported 
by the facts and that consumers have the information they need to 
make wiser choices about their health and diet said sen edward 
kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee 
the bush administration in midjuly proposed foodlabeling 
regulations that are similar to the provisions in the egislation 
and therefore opposed the bill however it did not threaten a 
veto 
the food and drug administration has been saying for years 
that it will revamp food labels in this country said ellen haas 
executive director of public voice for food and health policy who 
lobbied for the bill this legislation will see to it that fda 
follows through with its commitment 
the house meanwhile virtually eliminated any chance of federal 
fish inspection becoming law this year by approving a bill that 
differs sharply with companion legislation passed by the senate 
giving the agriculture department the inspection responsibility 
by 277153 the house approved a bill pushed by the energy and 
commerce and merchant marine and fisheries committees assigning the 
task to the fda which already has a limited fishinspection 
program 
during debate rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
energy and commerce committee held up a letter from commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan and white house chief of staff john sununu saying 
they would recommend a veto by president bush if the senate plan 
was adopted 
we dont have time for a conference in the waning days of 
the 101st congress to resolve the differences said agriculture 
committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas who tried 
unsuccessfully to win house approval of a measure similar to the 
senates 
no one questioned the need for inspection with seafood 
consumption up and about 60000 people becoming ill annually from 
eating fish even the industry wanted it 
the issue is not whether we want to inspect seafood said 
rep billy tauzin dla the issue is whether you want the 
agriculture committee which may not understand the difference 
between a chicken and a crawfish to undertake that effort 
the senate legislation approved last month gives the 
agriculture department primary responsibility by putting the 
inspection process under its wing the department already inspects 
meat and poultry 
the senate bill requires the fda to set limits on the level of 
contamination in fish that would be acceptable for human 
consumption it instructs the commerce department to monitor the 
waters in which fish are caught

the treasury department sold 172 billion of 
threemonth and sixmonth bills at an auction today and rescheduled 
a previously postponed sale of 100 billion of 52week bills for 
friday 
both auctions had been postponed because of congressional 
failure to raise the debt limit but were rescheduled earlier today 
shortly after president bush signed legislation raising the debt 
limit to 3195 trillion through saturday 
the department said it had sold 86 billion in threemonth 
bills at an average discount rate of 720 percent up from 718 
percent last week another 86 billion was sold in sixmonth bills 
at an average discount rate of 716 percent down from 722 percent 
last week 
the threemonth rate was the highest since threemonth bills 
sold for 732 percent on last sept 24 the sixmonth rate was the 
lowest since sixmonth bills averaged 715 percent on aug 1 1988 
the new discount rates understate the actual return to investors 
744 percent for threemonth bills with a 10000 bill selling 
for 981800 and 753 percent for a sixmonth bill selling for 
963800 
the two auctions were put off after the debt ceiling reverted to 
312 trillion last saturday the federal debt already had exceeded 
that amount 
however to keep within the 3195 trillion limit the treasury 
said the amount of the rescheduled threemonth and sixmonth bills 
usually offered on mondays was lowered from 192 billion the 
52week bill offering which had been scheduled for oct 18 was 
reduced from 108 billion 
the administration has asked congress to raise the ceiling 
another postponed auction a 12 billion 2year note offering 
set for wednesday has not been rescheduled

opec president sadek boussena said 
thursday the cartel will hold a formal meeting on dec 12 in vienna 
to discuss the oil markets which have been thrown into disarray by 
the persian gulf crisis 
but boussena said the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries was doing as much as it can to pump extra oil into the 
markets to make up for the loss of some 4 million barrels of 
embargoed iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
he told a news conference that the cartel was producing at its 
maximum and sometimes to the detriment of the oilfields he did 
not elaborate 
boussena who is the algerian mines minister didnt say how 
much the cartel was pumping but he said it was under the production 
level of 225 million barrels a day set last july analysts have 
estimated september output at 223 million barrels a day 
he said opec would likely not be able to meet demand for its oil 
in midwinter predicting a gap of 1 million to 15 million barrels 
a day between supply and demand oil companies would have to draw 
down their stocks to meet the demand he said 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the cartel suspended its 
quota system to allow its members to pump as much oil as possible 
to make up the shortfall in the market the embargo on kuwaiti and 
iraqi oil was imposed after the invasion 
boussena said the oil producing nations would return to their 
quota system once the gulf crisis ended 
he made his remarks after attending an energy seminar sponsored 
by the belgian government

financial services fell 98 percent to 1 million from 1989s 50 
million pretax capital gains totaled 4 million in the third 
quarter compared with 207 million in the corresponding 1989 
quarter 
given the adverse forces in our markets including both the 
weak pricing environment in the property and casualty insurance

oil shot up more than 3 per barrel on the

gulf 
weve got all sorts of little talk in the market of troops

light sweet crude oil jumped 302 to 3410 per barrel for 
december delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
shortly after noon january and february delivery contracts were up 
2 per barrel and later months were all up by more than 1 
todays early trading was a continuation of crudes rise of 
171 per barrel on wednesday that upward surge halted a sharp 
slide that had knocked oil from above 40 per barrel to less than 
30 as traders responded to hints of a peaceful resolution to the 
gulf crisis 
traders now think they overestimated the potential for a 
negotiated settlement they have begun wondering whether crude will 
move back into the 40 range or fluctuate in the 30 range 
crudes soaring prices since iraq invaded kuwait in august have 
been rooted in war psychology as the world has maintained an

the price of mca inc stock shot 
higher today on the new york stock exchange one day after gyrating 
wildly on a report that a big japanese company was in no rush to 
acquire the company 
trading in mca shares on the exchange was halted twice wednesday 
after the nikkei news agency reported matsushita electric 
industrial co wants a cooloff period in buyout talks 
but a top matsushita official later called that erroneous as 
did news reports today 
if anything the indications are exactly the opposite things 
have been going very well a person familiar with the deal told 
the los angeles times 
the wall street journal quoted individuals close to the 
discussions as saying the talks are firmly on track and could lead 
to an agreement as early as november 
by midday today mca stock had gained back nearly all its losses 
of wednesday shooting up 637 per share to 5637 
todays news reports did not identify anyone by name but the 
journal said people familiar with both companies were particularly 
eager to dispel any notion that the merger talks were troubled 
it said that several sticking points have already been resolved 
including a plan to divest mcas new yorkarea television station 
wwor which cannot be foreignowned 
a buyout of mca the parent of universal studios could be worth 
as much as 86 billion according to reports 
the nikkei news report said talks with mca officials wont 
resume until midnovember and quoted a senior matsushita executive 
as saying if the two sides cant agree on a price then we are 
prepared to pull out of the deal 
the report sent mcas stock down as low as 48 a share from 
tuesdays close of 5886 before exchange officials stopped trading 
in the early afternoon 
trading was resumed only to be halted again after matsushitas 
denial of the report prompted an excess of buy orders mca finished 
the day at 50 a share down 887 
discussions with mca inc are proceeding in an orderly fashion 
and there are no new developments to announce matsushita 
executive vice president masihiko hirata said 
an mca spokeswoman chris hanson said the company would have no 
comment 
the nikkei news report which didnt identify sources by name 
said matsushita wants to let mcas share price which climbed above 
63 since the deal was reported in late september run out of 
steam before negotiating a price tag for mca again 
mcas asking price is still considerably higher than 
matsushita is hoping to pay the nikkei story reported during 
the cooloff period matsushita is planning to reassess the market 
value of mca in an effort to come up with a new price for the 
american group company officials say 
the report also said that matsushita wants more time to look 
into how mcas broadcasting division can be separated from the 
other operations to comply with federal law that prohibits foreign 
concerns from owning us television and radio stations 
the report closely followed word of another potential problem 
for the deal national park service director james ridenours 
suggestion that mca sell a subsidiary that provides food and 
lodging at yosemite national park because park lovers were 
concerned about it falling into foreign hands 
another difficulty posed by the proposed takeover is how to 
structure the deal so that large mca shareholders such as chairman 
lew wasserman and geffen entertainment chief david geffen can avoid 
paying taxes on their gains

american airlines inc moved today to block rival 
ual corps 400 million purchase of pan am corps london routes 
in a letter to pan am chairman thomas g plaskett american 
chairman robert crandall said his company wanted to bid on the 
routes and suggested government regulators might not approve the 
ualpan am deal 
as i have told you many times in the past most recently in 
our telephone conversation of monday oct 22 we have for some 
time been interested in acquiring a number of pan ams 
international route authorities including those to the united 
kingdom crandall said in the letter released publicly 
the agreement with ual parent of united airlines was announced 
tuesday night 
officials at new yorkbased pan am and chicagobased ual had no 
immediate comment 
we believe that the fiduciary duties owed by you and your 
fellow directors to maximize value for pan ams stockholders and 
creditors dictate that you afford us an opportunity to make a 
competing offer for these assets crandall said 
crandall said american could pursue a transaction superior to 
the proposed united transaction but he offered no specifics 
pan am has suffered big losses in recent years and the deal 
with ual came after fruitless efforts pan am to find a merger 
partner or buyer for the airline 
the deal which would give united a gateway to europe through 
london is the carriers second victory over american in recent 
months shortly after reclaiming the no 1 domestic market share 
from american united beat out american for government approval of 
chicagotokyo routes 
under the agreement ual would acquire pan ams uslondon 
routes except for those leaving from miami and detroit uals 
routes into london will leave from new york washington san 
francisco los angeles and seattle 
ual will also get unused pan am international routes originating 
in san francisco washington and london 
the deal also provides for ual to buy gates hangar and office 
space at san francisco and washingtons dulles international 
airport two boeing 747 jumbo jets and spare parts 
the london routes currently bring about 500 million in gross 
revenues 
earlier today the teamsters airline division also stated its 
opposition to the pan amual deal saying pan am should have gotten 
more money for the london routes the union which represents 6500 
pan am workers said it planned to file a lawsuit challenging the 
sale 
pan am should have gotten 750 million to 1 billion in order 
to pay off its obligations to the workers said william f 
genoese director of the teamsters airline division the deal 
announced by pan am would hurt our members no arrangements have 
been made to protect the workers

tenneco inc said thursday its profit rose a 
modest 1 percent in the third quarter and predicted lower 
fourthquarter earnings than last year 
the energy equipment and chemical company cited uncertainty in 
the economy and in the industries it serves in reporting earnings 
of 91 million or 70 cents per share that compares with 90 
million or 68 cents per share for the yearago quarter 
revenues in the quarter ended sept 30 were 34 billion 
compared with 32 billion for the yearago period 
the uncertain business environment overall and deterioration 
in some of the industries in which we do business has begun to 
impact our financial performance and is likely to continue 
impacting our businesses during the balance of 1990 said james 
l ketelsen company chairman and chief executive officer 
farm and construction equipment and chemical businesses of 
tenneco were hurt most in the third quarter he said 
as a result it now appears that our earnings in the fourth 
quarter will not match the strong earnings we posted in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 said ketelsen 
the company reported higher operating income at the newport news 
shipbuilding facility income totaled 49 million compared with 
37 million in the period last year as a result of increased 
activity and higher margins in naval shipbuilding tenneco said 
in the first nine months the company said it earned 431 
million or 334 per common share compared with 379 million or 
288 per share for the same period last year

grain and soybean futures prices closed modestly 
lower thursday in light trading on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting slack export demand and good harvesting conditions 
speculation that the soviet union might soon buy more us corn 
cooled amid reports from moscow indicating the soviets might not 
make any more such purchases without us credit 
the soviets are required to buy 650000 metric tons of us corn 
by the end of the year to fulfill a 1 million ton agreement but 
analysts said it now appears the soviets may not honor the pact 
i wouldnt bet the rent on it said victor lespinasse an 
assistant vice president in the grain trading division of dean 
witter reynolds inc 
dry weather in the midwest permitted the corn and soybean 
harvest to advance and similar conditions were ideal for winter 
wheat planting in the central and southern plains states analysts 
said 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 263 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with deceber at 230 a bushel oats

the rise and fall of polly peck international plc 
the conglomerate that owns del monte fruit and sansui stereos 
marks one of the most traumatic corporate demises in british 
history 
after five tense weeks and in a desperate effort to survive a 
highflying company of the 1980s turned to the courts thursday and 
obtained help in sorting out debts exceeding 1 billion pounds or 
196 billion 
polly pecks turkishcypriot chairman and chief executive 
officer asil nadir insisted to the financial times that his 
company was sound he told the newspaper he was a victim of a 
greekinspired political conspiracy and of bungling by british 
investigators 
nadir did not return a phone call from the associated press 
thursday 
the high court on thursday afternoon granted polly pecks 
request that it appoint court administrators and assigned three 
accountants 
court administration allows for the orderly repayment of debt 
either through existing operations or through the full or partial 
liquidation of a companys assets it is akin to the bankruptcy 
laws of the united states 
the high court dismissed a rival petition filed earlier in the 
week by a creditor the national bank of canada seeking immediate 
liquidation of polly peck 
justice sir robert andrew morritt said granting the 
administration order reduced uncertainty and offered the best 
chance for creditors to be repaid in full and others to benefit 
when polly pecks directors announced late wednesday they had 
decided on this course of action they said it would ensure the 
companys survival 
the decision followed weeks of wrangling over financing with 
increasingly nervous creditors and came after nadir failed to drum 
up the money he had promised them 
the drama began when polly peck suspended trading in its shares 
on londons stock exchange on sept 20 after the price tumbled 55 
percent in a matter of hours 
creditors pressed for answers because nadir had given banks 
polly peck shares as collateral for loans 
the stockprice dive was prompted by news that the serious fraud 
office had raided the offices of south audley management ltd a 
company linked to a nadir family trust 
nadir 47 has been plagued in the british press by allegations 
of links to a reputed polly peck stock fraud scheme the company 
and nadir who was questioned by the fraud office on the day of the 
share collapse have denied wrongdoing 
polly pecks stock had fallen sharply since august when nadir 
who then owned about 28 percent of the company said he wanted to 
take it private then abandoned the plan after five days the 
exchange criticized him for hastiness 
nadir who since has reduced his stake to about 24 percent 
remains the largest shareholder in the conglomerate he built up 
over more than two decades 
the son of a wealthy cypriot nadir came to britain in the 1960s 
and set up his own clothing business 
nadir an ally of turkish president turgut ozal also developed 
fruit distribution electronics tourism and publishing businesses 
in turkey and in the area of cyprus which turkey wrested from 
greece in 1974 
in 1980 nadir took control of an ailing british textile company 
called polly peck and used it as his stock market vehicle for 
expansion 
it bought the del monte fruit operation from rjr nabisco inc 
for 875 million last year and sansui electric co for 135 million 
in december 
the company which employs 17000 people was highly profitable 
over the years with polly pecks aftertax profit rising 16 
percent to 268 million on revenue of 227 billion in 1989 profit 
more than doubled the first six months of this year 
polly pecks stock was one of the best performers of the 1980s 
which helped make nadir one of britains richest individuals with a 
personal fortune at more than 400 million 
but the staid british business world continued to consider nadir 
something of a flamboyant outsider 
as the saga now stands much of nadirs wealth has vanished 
polly pecks 23000 shareholders have no idea how much their stock 
is worth

philips the dutch electronics 
manufacturing giant said thursday it will cut nearly 16 percent of 
its worldwide staff and eliminate stock dividends because of heavy 
losses and stiff competition 
the company which makes items ranging from light bulbs to 
televisions under a range of brands said it lost nearly 13 
billion in the third quarter of the year and has become too fat 
bureaucratic and complacent 
we have to look at our present performance compared to that of 
our current competition not compared to our past performance 
philips chairman jan d timmer told a news conference 
philips sales per employee are poor compared to the 
competition we just arent productive enough he said we need 
more entrepreneurial activity 
the company will trim up to 45000 of its 285700 workers by the 
end of next year timmer said that will help philips survive 
against increasingly aggressive rivals primarily japanese 
electronics makers 
it was not immediately clear how many of the companys 
approximately 50000 us workers would be affected but most of 
the job cuts were expected to be in europe 
the reductions are an addition to a cut of 10000 jobs that is 
already occurring at the worlds sixth largest electronics company 
in another sign of austerity that was bound to anger philips 
stockholders timmer also said the company would not pay8a 
dividend 
its exceptional for a company that has always cherished a 
stable dividend policy not to pay a dividend but under the present 
conditions it is not justified he said the company paid a 
dividend of about 3 a share in 1989 
the dividend cut caused philips stock to drop because of selling 
by international investment funds barred from holding stock that 
dont pay dividends 
philips stock closed down 35 cents at 1195 a share thursday 
on the amsterdam stock exchange 
philipss thirdquarter lost compared to a profit of 134 
million in the same period last year timmer said 
north american philips corporation the usbased subsidiary 
manufactures lights appliances audio and video products and 
medical equipment under brand names that include philips magnovox 
norelco philco and sylvania 
a spokesman for north american philips albert ruttner said it 
was premature to say how many us workers would be affected by the 
cutback 
timmer did not specify in which of the 45 nations where philips 
has employees the job losses would occur but observers believed 
most of the cuts would be in europe 
announcements will be made by some of the managers in the 
countries concerned we have left it up to them timmer said 
trouble for the company formally called nv phiiips 
gloeilampenfabrieken began in the spring when shareholders 
criticized former chairman cj van der klugt for being too 
optimistic about firstquarter results 
timmer who has a reputation for ruthless costcutting took 
over from van der klugt in may after successfully pulling philips 
consumer electronics division out of the red 
the earlier cut of 10000 jobs hit hardest at philips computer 
division where 4000 jobs were eliminated

later contract months all rose 2 per barrel the daily trading 
limit imposed by the exchange as oil regained more of the ground 
it had lost in a recent slide accentuated by a record oneday fall 
of 541 a barrel on monday 
once again the market is worried about confrontation said 
brian tagler a broker with shearson lehman brothers inc the 
recent declines had come as traders bet on the possibility of a 
peaceful resolution to the crisis that began with iraqs invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 
crude moved up in the morning as defense secretary dick cheney 
said as many as 100000 more us troops could be sent to the gulf 
and cia director william webster said the middle east will never be 
secure while iraqi president saddam hussein is able to threaten 
neighbors 
after oil rose about 2 per barrel thursday on those comments 
as well as a saudi intelligence report indicating iraq might have 
as many as 500000 troops in kuwait crude was propelled even 
higher by wild rumors that swept the exchange 
traders first responded to a rumor that president bush had given 
the iraqis two weeks to vacate kuwait a rally late in the day was 
sparked by another rumor that us troops had moved into kuwait 
that rumor circled on the pit and we rallied for new highs 
said thomas blakeslee an energy analyst with pegasus econometric 
group inc in hoboken nj the rumor was eventually denied by the 
pentagon 
as oil rose so did futures for refined petroleum products 
unleaded gasoline rose 821 cents to 9360 cents per gallon on 
november contracts later contract months all rose by their limit 
of 4 cents a gallon 
home heating oil rose 655 cents to 9167 cents per gallon on 
november contracts all later contracts were up by the limit of 4 
cents a gallon 
natural gas was up 6 cent to 2446 per 1000 cubic feet on

donald ray dixon used vernon savings association 
funds for prostitutes beach houses a yacht and other expensive 
entertainment while watching the institution fail prosecutors said 
thursday in his fraud trial 
dixons federal trial one of the most prominent prosecutions in 
the nationwide cleanup of the savings amp loan crisis began with the 
government portraying vernons former owner as a highflying texan 
who had pleasure on his mind more often than supervising his sampls 
affairs 
in these instances vernon paid for the toys of mr dixon the 
bottom line is don dixon didnt pay for these toys said robert 
e hauberg a us justice department attorney 
he said dixon used the failed thrifts funds to pay for beach 
houses near san diego a yacht anchored in fort lauderdale fla 
and two hunting trips to kansas 
but dixons attorney william m ravkind said investigators 
have pressured witnesses into accusing dixon of masterminding a 
conspiracy 
the government is saying that don dixon engaged in a scheme to 
defraud the federal government but this conspiracy does not 
include mr dixon ravkind said 
ravkind said he will show that dixon didnt profit from vernons 
failure dixon invested 13 million into the thrift but was left 
with a 5 million dollar personal debt ravkind said 
the 38count indictment also accuses dixon of conspiring with 
other vernon officials to give money to several politicians 
including former house speaker jim wright 
hauberg likened dixons alleged freewheeling and dealing to a 
character from larry mcmurtrys pulitzerprize winning novel 
lonesome dove 
like gus from lonesome dove the hero figure who drove down 
the cattle from texas to montana when gus turned and said were 
gonna do it but were going to have to lie cheat and steal to do 
it hauberg said 
hauberg said dixon used vernon funds to hire female escorts to 
attend parties at the solana beach house the women whom hauberg 
called professionals usually spent the night 
ravkind said dixon who plans to testify claimed no sexual 
activity occurred at the solana beach house 
were not going to solve the sampl problem by locking up don 
dixon and throwing away the key said ravkind 
the witnesses who could be called to testify against dixon 
include former vernon chairman woody lemons who was sentenced to 
30 years in prison earlier this year his sentence is the stiffest 
to date for an sampl officer 
if convicted on all counts dixon could be sentenced to up to 
190 years in prison and fined as much as 95 million 
the dallas thrift collapsed in 1987 and requires an estimated 
13 billion government bailout financed by taxpayers 
another scheduled prosecution witness convicted madam karen 
wilkening is recovering from a bout of paralysis 
ms wilkening who allegedly supplied dixon with prostitutes for 
the parties was hospitalized monday suffering from the nerve 
disorder bells palsy 
she is serving a 44month prison sentence in california and was 
later released to law enforcement authorities

whirlpool corp said thursday its 
thirdquarter profits advanced nearly 28 percent but the gain was 
the result of the sale of a kentucky plant 
for the quarter ended sept 30 the huge appliance maker said 
net income totaled 60 million or 86 cents a share up from 47 
million or 68 cents a share a year ago 
without the sale of the danville ky vacuum cleaner plant 
profits would have plummeted 21 percent to 37 million the company 
said the plant is now part of a joint venture between whirlpool 
and matsushita electric industrial co 
revenue during the quarter grew 11 percent to 166 billion 
from 15 billion a year earlier 
for the first nine months of the year whirlpool reported net 
income of 126 million or 182 a share down 12 percent from 138 
million or 199 a share in the 1989 period revenue totaled 5 
billion up 15 percent from 472 billion 
whirlpool chairman and chief executive david r whitwam blamed 
the decline in profits on the weakening north american economy 
which has softened the demand for appliances he expects 
industrywide us shipments of appliances to be down about 8 
percent for the year 
in a separate development thursday whirlpools dishwasher plant 
in mount sterling ky packed up its last machine shortly past 
noon and laid off 610 workers the victims of slow sales in the 
appliance business 
whirlpool had announced in february it would close the plant and 
shift its operations to findlay ohio

a goup of workers from the soviet 
unions richest coal mines defiantly formed an independent union 
thursday night breaking with a larger miners congress and the 
wishes of soviet officials 
the more than 130 miners angrily denounced the protracted 
debates that have occupied the 900 delegates at a congress that 
claims to represent 2 million workers 
its too much to come here for four days and adopt only one 
resolution said vyacheslav golikov leader of the kuzbass 
council of workers committees which called the breakaway meeting 
organizers of the formal congress the second since a series of 
miners strikes last year said they still hoped to form an 
independent union before concluding friday 
the break came the same day that soviet coal minister mikhail i 
shchadov warned restive miners that half the nations shafts could 
close without state subsidies shchadov made a pitch for the 
workers loyalties and urged patience while moscow drafts a new 
plan to improve their lives 
when you adopt your decision remember that it is crucial for 
us to be together not divided shchadov said 
shchadov told the disgruntled miners that they should have a 
wage increase and a degree of control over their own mines but 
pointedly reminded them that the state is helping keep moneylosing 
mines operating 
an independent miners union could become a potent political and 
economic force in the soviet union with enormous influence over the 
countrys energy supply 
the breakaway group made up of representatives of mines in 
western siberia the kazakh republic and the ukraine marched to 
a hall across the street from the congress for its meeting 
it voted to make their new union a confederation of smaller 
workers committees most of which were formed during the strikes 
that threatened to leave much of the soviet union without fuel in 
1989 
a confederation is for our future one miner shouted as 
workers tumbled over each other for a chance to speak at the only 
microphone 
a confederation would allow scores of smaller unions to maintain 
their own independence within an umbrella organization 
the formation of a breakaway confederation comes one day after 
the governmentsponsored national congress of trade unions voted in 
moscow to disband after 70 years and reconstitute itself as a 
voluntary association of unions 
a spokesman for the breakaway miners said they had no interest 
in belonging to a reorganized government trade union 
the old union called itself new but its really the same one 
because its structure is the same said golikov who has been 
dubbed the lech walesa of the soviet union for his effort to create 
an opposition political movement of workers 
the kuzbass miners among the most radical at the congress drew 
up a draft platform for the new confederation that set out a loose 
structure of grassroots organizations legislative bodies and an 
executive committee the rich kuzbass region has 60 mines most 
near the town of kuznetsk in western siberia 
miners are uncertain about how far they could part from the 
government in forming an independent confederation of miners 
unions 
they said they would defer a possible new strike pending 
resolution of their outstanding complaints by the legislature of 
the russian republic now in session in moscow 
the 1989 miners strikes began to protest working and living 
conditions but quickly escalated to include demands for regional 
economic autonomy for the main mining regions 
the government then persuaded the miners to return to work by 
promising to meet most of their demands but most of the promises 
remain unfulfilled an issue that hasspurred new strikes 
shchadov said the government hopes to pour up to 101 billion 
into the mining regions next year to build schools homes and 
hospitals and plans to convert at least one weapons plant into a 
factory for making new mining equipment he said 
our technology is backward he said receiving one of two 
rounds of applause during his twohour speech 
the 900 delegates in the donetsk conference hall were generally 
receptive and good humored during shchadovs appearance shchadov 
was shouted down by miners in july 1989 when they were engaged in 
a crippling strike

gold prices continued to climb thursday as the resurgent oil 
market fanned inflation fears 
but platinum prices dropped sharply reflecting declining 
japanese investor interest and worldwide economic jitters 
on other commodity markets grain and soybean futures retreated 
and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 230 to 240 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for spot delivery at 37580 a 
troy ounce 
the increase marked golds sixth daily advance in the last seven 
sessions following a plunge to a threemonth low of 360 on oct 
16 
silver futures settled 19 cents to 2 cents lower with the spot 
price at 4204 a troy ounce in lackluster trading on the commodity 
exchange 
platinum was 660 to 8 lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange with the spot price at 41580 a troy ounce 
analysts said demand for gold has increased as a result of lower 
prices for the metal and higher prices this week for crude oil 
which has bounced back sharply amid escalating middle east war 
rhetoric 
on thursday for example us defense secretary dick cheney 
said the united states conceivably could send another 100000 
troops to saudi arabia which fed rumors of a possible us attack 
on iraqi forces in kuwait 
the war drums were beating today said william oneill a 
precious metals expert with merrill lynch 
higher oil prices could portend higher inflation which 
typically spurs investor demand for gold 
higher oil prices also could tip industrialized nations into 
recession and reduce industrial demand for platinum which is 
widely used in automobile pollutioncontrol systems 
james steel an oil and metals analyst with the commodities 
brokerage refco inc said platinum also was pressured by lower 
japanese stock prices the japanese value platinum highly as an 
investment and jewelry metal 
in petroleum trading on the new york mercantile exchange light 
sweet crude oil settled 2 to 317 higher with december at 3425 
a barrel heating oil was 4 cents to 655 cents higher with 
november at 9167 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 4 cents to 
821 cents higher with november at 9360 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in light trading 
on the chicago board of trade reflecting slack export demand and 
harvest pressure 
speculation about possible soviet purchases of us corn cooled 
amid reports from moscow indicating the soviets might not make any 
more such purchases without us credit 
the soviets are required to buy 650000 metric tons of us corn 
by the end of the year to fulfill a 1 million ton agreement but 
analysts said it now appears the soviets may not honor the pact 
wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents lower with december at 263 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 230 
a bushel oats were cent to cent lower with december at 123 
a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 5 cents lower with november 
at 605 a bushel 
cattle futures rose on the chicago mercantile exchange for the 
third straight day while pork futures ended mixed as the bearish 
impact of lower hog prices was offset by indications of slower hog 
marketings 
live cattle settled unchanged to 55 cent higher with december 
at 7787 cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent to 73 cent 
higher with november at 8717 cents a pound live hogs were 05 
cent lower to 35 cent higher with december at 5382 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 115 cents to 2 cents lower with february 
at 6485 cents a pound

bank of boston posted a 255 million loss or 353 
per share in the third quarter the victim of the deteriorating 
northeast economy and a weak real estate market bank officials 
said thursday 
for the same quarter last year bank of boston reported a 125 
million loss or 182 per share 
bank of boston last month had predicted a heavy loss of at least 
200 million in the quarter ended sept 30 
thats within the range we forecast a month or so ago bank 
spokesman wayne j taylor said of the loss announced thursday we 
telegraphed this more than a month ago it should not come as a 
surprise 
the bank said it set aside 200 million for bad loans during the 
third quarter bringing the total loan loss provision for 1990 so 
far to 450 million that compares with a 370 million provision 
for 1989s third quarter and 442 million overall last year 
bank officials said most of the bad loans were for real estate 
bank of boston new englands largest bank had shown signs of 
recovery earlier this year after posting huge losses last year it 
turned a slight profit in this years second quarter and officials

consumers would pay more for gasoline 
cigarettes and beer under the deficitreduction plan nearing 
completion in congress but the wealthiest americans would face 
incometax increases averaging 63 percent as well 
as many as 4 million slightly less welltodo couples and 
individuals including most members of congress could get a tax 
cut because the top rate on their earnings now 33 percent would 
drop to 31 percent 
they also would get the bills only tax break for capital gains 
it is nothing like president bushs proposed deep cut in taxes on 
capital gains which are profits from investments but it would 
prevent anyone from paying a capitalgains rate higher than 28 
percent 
the 600000 richest taxpayers would see their top tax rate rise 
from 28 percent to 31 percent even those with incomes just 
slightly above the 100000 mark could lose a portion of their 
itemized deductions and part of the tax saving arising from their 
personal exemptions 
the bill whose provisions were still being negotiated and 
subject to change would raise taxes by about 150 billion over the 
next five years but for most people below 50000 in income the 
only increase would be in consumer taxes 
those with incomes under 20000 would on average get a tax 
cut because of a higher earnedincome credit which helps poor 
working families with children 
most with incomes between 20000 and 200000 would face tax 
increases in the neighborhood of 2 percent although the bite on 
those between 50000 and 75000 would be slightly less 15 
percent 
the most striking difference between this bill and those of the 
last decade is the disproportionately larger burden the new plan 
would impose on those with higher incomes the joint committee on 
taxation estimated the share of federal taxes paid by people with 
incomes over 200000 would rise from 154 percent to 161 percent 
the bill would raise the 9centagallon gasoline tax and the 
15cent diesel tax by 5 cents each 
the tax on cigarettes now 16 cents a pack would rise to 20 
cents on jan 1 and to 24 cents two years later taxes on snuff 
cigars and other tobacco would go up by 25 percent in each of those 
years 
the levy on a sixpack of beer now 16 cents would double 
negotiators are deciding whether to raise the tax on liquor now 
1250 for a gallon of 100proof to 1370 or 14 taxes on wines 
which vary according to alcohol content also will go up the 
3cent levy on a fifth of table wine would rise to 21 or 25 cents 
fliers would pay 6 more on an average 300mile roundtrip 
ticket the 8 percent tax would rise to 10 percent 
a new tax would take 10 percent of the price of certain 
expensive luxuries cars boats planes jewels and furs for 
example the tax would apply only to that portion of the price of 
cars exceeding 30000 and jewelry over 5000 
the 145 percent tax that finances basic medicare coverage would 
cost higherincome workers and their employers more it now applies 
only to the first 51300 earned each year the bill would raise it 
to 125000 or 130000 
a worker earning 85000 a year for example would pay 1233 
or 489 more than present law a 50000 earner would pay no more 
the tax is matched by the employer 
the bill would limit the total of certain itemized deductions 
that a person with income over 100000 or a couple over 150000 
may write off but the 3 percent limitation would apply only 
against income above those levels 
for each 10000 of income above the target the proposal would 
reduce allowable deductions by 300 thus a couple with 175000 
income and itemized deductions of 35000 would be allowed to write 
off only 34250 
this has the effect of raising the 31 percent top tax rate for 
these people to 32 percent 
the bill also would gradually take back from the welltodo the 
tax saving realized from personal exemptions this would result in 
larger highincome families paying a higher marginal tax rate than 
those with fewer children a notion under attack as a tax on 
children 
for 1990 a taxpayer is allowed a 2050 exemption for himself 
and another for each dependent at the 31 percent top tax rate set 
by the bill that would mean a tax saving of 636 per exemption 
single people would begin losing part of that 636 tax saving 
once their taxable income income after subtracting deductions and 
exemptions passes 100000 the benefit would be lost totally 
when income hits 225000 for couples who file jointly and have no 
children the benefit would be phased out between 150000 and 
275000 of income 
the effect of the phaseout would be to boost the top tax rate on 
these taxpayers by onehalf of a percentage point thus the limit 
on deductions and the exemption phaseout would raise the top rate 
to 325 percent for a single person and 33 percent for a couple 
a couple with two children could have a top rate of 34 percent 
on part of their earnings a couple with six children could pay 36 
percent

general motors corps new saturn cars officially 
went on sale thursday but amid all the hoopla at dealerships there 
was lingering worry about a souring economy 
the last time a us automaker introduced a new line of its own 
cars was 1957 just before the economy slipped into a recession 
the car then was the edsel 
as it was 33 years ago with edsel dealers saturn dealers 
aggressively promoted the cars on their first day of retail sale 
on both sides of the country dealers dueled for bragging rights on 
who sold the first saturn 
in his own version of time travel brad boeckmann of saturn of 
the valley in sepulveda calif delivered a fourdoor saturn at 9 
oclock pdt wednesday he reasoned that back east wednesday was 
turning into thursday the official launch date for the new line of 
gm cars 
we figured at midnight our time it would be 3 am east coast 
time he said thursday so we delivered ours at 9 oclock 
during a big party for employees saturn officials bankers and 
potential customers 
the first car went to andrew and patricia gibson of saugus 
calif they had no tradein 
paul lockey owner of saturn of clearwater in florida honored 
saturns official launch according to east coast time 
we delivered one at one second after midnight he said 
the lady who bought it traded in an oldsmobile shes betty 
terry 45 of tampa 
that type of trade however is what gm is hoping to avoid 
saturn officials have said they want people to buy saturns instead 
of import cars although they concede that a majority of firstyear 
sales are likely to go to people who are gm customers anyway 
terry a fifthgrade teachers aide at anderson elementary 
school in tampa traded in a 1985 oldsmobile delta 88 
basically i wanted a smaller car and i wanted something with 
better gas mileage she said 
fuel economy has been rising on the list of priorities for 
newcar buyers recently especially since gasoline prices began 
rocketing after the aug 2 iraq invasion of kuwait 
rising fuel prices are just part of the reason some economists 
are predicting that the us economy is heading into a recession 
unemployment is up consumer confidence down and inflation is 
rising 
the economy in the mid1950s was facing many of the same 
pressures and the demise of ford motor cos edsel has been blamed 
partly on the economic downturn 
but the relatively high price of the edsel and its design 
especially the horsecollar looking grille shared a large part of 
the responsibility for the death of the car that has come to 
symbolize failure in america 
there was no talk of failure among saturn dealers thursday 
i think weve really got to screw up to make this fail 
boeckmann said twentynine saturn dealerships were open in 10 
states in the south and west for thursdays kickoff they received 
about half of their scheduled allocations because saturn officials 
were especially strict in their quality control inspections at the 
companys spring hill tenn assembly plant

delta air lines on thursday joined three other 
carriers in raising air fares for the third time since the persian 
gulf crisis boosted the price of jet fuel 
delta said domestic fares would rise by 58 percent for tickets 
purchased on or after oct 31 it blamed a doubling of jet fuel 
prices for the increase 
northwest airlines has also announced a 58 percent hike to 
start oct 31 while continental and eastern airlines also said 
they would raise rates 
delta said its costs for jet fuel have risen 115 percent since 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and touched off a steady escalation 
in the price of crude oil and its byproducts 
we take this action reluctantly but previous fare hikes in 
response to rising fuel prices have fallen well short of levels 
necessary to offset these increased costs whit hawkins deltas

struggling unisys corp said thursday it 
may not return to profitability this quarter as originally expected 
as it announced the resignation of its chairman plans to eliminate 
5000 jobs and steppedup asset sales 
the nations thirdlargest computer company also announced that 
it lost 3568 million in the third quarter or 242 a share 
compared with a loss of 648 million or 425 a share in the same 
period last year 
revenue totaled 24 billion up from 235 billion in last 
years third quarter 
the most recent loss was increased by a charge against earnings 
of 181 million to pay for consolidations and the elimination of 
the jobs through attrition a hiring freeze and possibly selected 
layoffs said spokesman mike stugrin the 1989 quarter included a 
231 million restructuring charge 
unisys also said it was very possible it would report a loss 
in the current quarter unisys until recently predicted it would 
return to profitability this quarter a belief shared by several 
industry analysts 
unisys statement on the current quarter prompted one of the 
nations two leading creditrating agencies standard amp poors 
corp to lower by one notch its rating of 4 billion in unisys 
debt a lower rating means unisys may have to pay more to borrow 
money 
w michael blumenthal announced he would resign as chairman and 
a member of the unisys board effective nov 1 blumenthal who 
engineered the 1986 merger of burroughs corp and sperry corp that 
formed unisys retired from unisys as chief executive officer april 
1 turning over the office to james a unruh 
unruh who also is president was elected chairman to replace 
blumenthal 
blumenthal the 64yearold former us treasury secretary and 
burroughs chairman said he was resigning because of his 
obligations as limited partner in the investment banking firm 
lazard freres amp co 
blumenthal is cochairman of a new international group of 
lazard which will be based in paris 
since last october unisys has cut more than 8000 jobs closed 
plants and refocused product lines inherited from its predecessor 
companies 
the company which employs about 78000 said the new job cuts 
would be made by mid1991 and will affect most operating units 
but will not result in reductions in the activities by its direct 
sales force key research programs and customer support services 
unisys said it was looking into a broad range of asset sales to 
reduce debt which mushroomed as unisys borrowed to pay dividends 
when profits lagged in the 1980s 
unisys said it hired lazard freres and another investment bank 
james wolfensohn inc to explore the sales but it did not 
disclose what assets might be involved 
unruh said in a statement that it would be difficult but not 
impossible for unisys to achieve its goal of reducing its debt by 
600 million to 800 million by years end debt totaled 26 
billion at the end of the third quarter 
unruh said the quarters results reflect a weakening general 
business environment and the pronounced softness of demand in the 
worldwide computer industry 
order growth in the united states continues to be weak and 
orders have slowed significantly in europe in recent weeks 
reflecting customer concern about general economic conditions and 
about the middle east situation he said 
in these circumstances it is very possible we could post a 
loss for the fourth quarter instead of the gain we expected until 
very recently he said 
the restructuring launched in late 1989 wasnt sufficient to 
cope with the changing business environment unruh added 
despite the slump unisys said its timeplex computer networking 
business its defense unit and sales in asia and the pacific were 
doing well it also said cash flow had increased significantly over 
last year 
we remain confident of our course toward restoring the company 
to profitability and reducing its debt load he said 
for the nine months ended sept 30 unisys reported a net loss 
of 3482 million or 272 a share compared with a loss of 6733 
million or 475 a share in the same period last year revenue 
totaled 718 billion up from 713 billion

the former owner of a failed dallas savings 
and loan was accused thursday of illegally diverting 18 million to 
pay off delinquent loans as a way of postponing the 1 billion 
collapse of the once highflying thrift 
jarrett e woods jr former owner of the failed western savings 
association was accused in a criminal indictment of diverting the 
funds to help pay off bad loans so that federal regulators wouldnt 
discover the sampl was insolvent 
the 37count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in 
dallas charges woods with bank fraud misapplication of bank funds 
making false ledger entries and conspiracy 
the charges announced in washington by attorney general dick 
thornburgh carry a maximum sentence of 185 years in prison and 
fines totaling at least 82 milion or twice the loss proven by 
prosecutors 
we have corralled one of the biggest savings and loan bandits 
in texas thornburgh told reporters the freewheeling 
lifestyle and fraudulent management practices that led to westerns 
collapse helped set the trend for our national thrift crisis 
in dallas woods was expected to surrender to the fbi on friday 
and be taken before a federal magistrate his lawyer did not 
immediately return telephone calls 
woods lawyers asked us district judge robert b maloney for 
an order barring prosecutors from discussing the case the judge 
refused but ordered the announcement news conference to be held in 
washington something the justice department was doing anyway 
said spokesman doug tillett 
westerns failure in 1986 when it was taken over by federal 
regulators cost the taxpayers 1 billion the justice depatment 
said a civil suit filed earlier this week by the federal deposit 
insurance corp seeks to collect 560 million from woods it 
accuses woods of spending 7 million of depositors money in the 
months before western failed 
the thrift which woods purchased in 1982 with 2 million in 
borrowed money grew from 70 million in assets to 2 billion four 
years later said us attorney marvin collins 
collins said the case can be fairly characterized as an 
example of a real estate developer jarrett woods buying up a 
sleepy little sampl moving it to dallas pumping it full of 
highcost brokered funds and and then lending the money out on 
highrisk loans 
the indictment shows the great lengths that people will go to 
deceive regulators collins said 
the indictment charges that woods diverted 16 million from a 
60 million loan for a houston real estate deal to businessman 
james reagin a major borrower who was behind on loan payments to 
western 
most of the money plus 226 million that was diverted from the 
sale of western property was used to help reagin pay off loans so 
that western would not have to write them off as bad debts 
at one point reagin was behind on loans worth 64 million 
collins said 
just the loans to james reagin would have likely caused the 
failure of western savings association collins said 
reagin a houston businessman who faces sentencing in connection 
with the failure of the glen ellyn savings and loan in illinois is 
cooperating with prosecutors in their investigation of woods 
officials said 
while woods is not accused of pocketing any of the funds 
diverted to reagin collins said that as 100 percent owner of 
western woods was motivated by a desire to keep regulators from 
taking over the sampl 
the indictment also charges that woods arranged for a western 
subsidiary to pay a 48000 commission to a company that had not 
earned the money the indictment alleges the money was actually 
used to pay off a gambling debt woods owed

for the first fiscal quarter ended sept 30 atlantabased delta 
reported a loss of 516 million or 127 per share on operating 
revenue of 222 billion that compared with aftertax profit of 
1331 million or 253 per share on revenue of 217 billion in 
the same period last year 
this is the first loss delta has had in a september quarter 
since 1982 thomas j roeck jr senior vice president and chief 
financial officer said referring to the busy summer travel months 
roeck attributed the loss to the increase in jet fuel prices 
since the iraqi invastion of kuwait the increase added 781 
million to deltas expenses 
he also blamed softening demand and competition from eastern 
saying passenger revenue increased just 2 percent in the quarter 
if these trends continue the company expects to report a loss 
for the full calendar year roeck said 
delta spokesman bill berry said the company set aside 10 
million to be tapped if any of its competitors go out of business 
when an airline has to book a passenger on another carrier the fare 
difference goes into a pool that could be jeopardized by a 
bankruptcy 
for the first nine months deltas aftertax profits totaled 
538 million or 85 cents per share on operating revenue of 66 
billion that compared with earnings of 4089 million or 812 
per share on revenue of 65 billion for the same period last

united airlines parent ual corp said its thirdquarter net 
income slipped 4 percent reflecting a rise in jet fuel costs and a 
30 million expense from the failed employee buyout bid 
those and other expenses were nearly offset by a 93 million 
gain from the sale of 12 aircraft during the quarter 
ual posted net income of 10611 million or 487 per share 
for the three months ending sept 30 compared with 11086 
million or 511 per share for the same period a year ago 
thirdquarter operating revenues rose 15 percent to 297 
billion from 258 billion ual said from its headquarters in elk 
grove village ill 
the higher revenues were largely a function of uniteds 
continuing routeexpansion program which also was reflected in a 
nearly 12 percent increase in the number of miles flown on united 
airlines by paying passengers during the quarter 
uniteds aggressive expansion program accelerated earlier this 
week with an agreement to purchase transatlantic routes from pan 
am corp for 400 million 
uniteds archrival american airlines inc moved thursday to 
block the deal 
for the first nine months of 1990 ual had net income of 21799 
million or 1001 a share on revenue of 823 billion compared 
with net income of 31736 million or 1466 a share on revenue 
of 743 billion for the first nine months of 1989
