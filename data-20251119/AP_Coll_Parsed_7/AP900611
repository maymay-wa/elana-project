a judge dropped charges monday against a 
farmer after the suburban neighbors who filed complaints against 
him saying he ran a noisy tractor at night failed to show up in 
court 
however cook county judge john mcbride ruled the two counts of 
disturbing the peace against ray dettmering could be reinstated if 
the neighbors show they had a valid reason for missing the hearing 
said david brauer village prosecutor in matteson 
its like 90 percent dead brauer said of the case both 
citizens were advised to be here and they chose not to show 
dettmering 28 was arrested late the night of april 26 after 
neighbors complained about noise from a plow operating on 60 acres 
of leased farmland in matteson south of chicago 
if convicted of both counts he could have a year in jail and a 
1000 fine 
farming supporters quickly seized the case as an example of the 
continuing conflict between suburban dwellers moving out of the 
cities and farmers working land right next to the new subdivisions 
neither citizen who signed the complaint returned phone calls to 
their homes monday but both said earlier they didnt know a farmer 
was involved and neither planned to show up in court monday 
i would not have signed the complaint if id known he was a 
farmer doris norton said i thought he was a construction 
foreman for a builder 
even though things have worked out in his favor dettmering said 
the issue still isnt resolved because the court gave no direct 
ruling on whether he could plow at night 
he indicated that hell take his chances i guess its ok to 
get back out there he said from the shop in nearby peotone where 
he works as a mechanic during the day 
but farming officials said the conflict will continue between 
suburban residents seeking the quiet pastoral life and working 
farmers who know it isnt always like that on the north forty 
people who move out into the country are less tolerant of 
agricultural practices said bryan petrucci midwest director for 
the american farmland trust a nonprofit agency seeking to preserve 
the nations agricultural acreage without more righttofarm 
legislation we will only have more trouble

donna rhodes director of the national foundation for the 
improvement of education one of several groups that sponsored the 
study 
the poll found that teachers believe they can make a difference 
in changing overall education policy and reforming the educational 
system on virtually all levels if given the opportunity it was 
released as a gathering of education and business leaders 
recognized 115 elementary and secondary school teachers from 23 
areas 
sixtythree percent of the respondents said they believed they 
could influence change in their own school a great deal 
another 35 percent said a fair amount while 2 percent said 
not very much 
ninetysix percent said the role of teachers should be expanded 
in the area of educational decisionmaking more than nine out of 
10 favored schoolbased decisionmaking which teachers say will 
give them a greater voice in what happens in their classrooms 
the poll found that 86 percent wanted public school teachers to 
have more say in the allocation of funds 78 percent wanted more 
influence over curriculum 56 percent believed they should 
participate in the hiring of other teachers and 69 percent wanted 
input into the selection of the building principal in addition 71

nm one of the teachers being recognized she said few policy 
makers know much about what goes on daytoday in classrooms

to teachers program the margin of error is plus or minus 6 
percent the program singles out teachers from across the nation 
for recognition it is sponsored by the foundation the national 
alliance of business apple computer inc and group w television

because they represent the opinions of some of the best teachers in 
the country educators whose communities view them as the best and 
value what they do said rhodes 
their perception of the condition of education today is 
reflective of that held by the public at large she said

in 1984 ellen altmanns boss at laguardia 
hospital told her she was spending too much time assisting a man 
who had aids the physicians were angry with her and worried she 
was going to catch the disease by being in the same room with him 
so often 
so she did the only thing she felt she could do 
when i handed in my resignation ellen said i told them 
ive decided to work exclusively with patients with aids 
her supervisor was astounded what are you crazy arent you 
afraid you want to have a family someday youre going to catch 
something 
im not afraid ellen said im just not ignorant 
since the time before aids had a name ellen and ed altmann have 
built their professional and sometimes personal lives around 
caring for people with the fatal incurable disease they are both 
nurses colleagues for seven years spouses for five taking on the 
job it seemed at times no one else wanted 
aids is especially nursings disease said ellen 32 now 
the head nurse for the newly opened aids unit at lenox hill 
hospital on manhattans upper east side i could work in a 
doctors office i could work in a lab i could work in surgery i 
could work in maternalchild health where a lot of things are 
mostly happy 
but i think this is really the essence of nursing 
if aids is nursings disease as the altmanns believe it is 
because medical technology has made so little headway against it 
nursing care can make a difference can help keep a person with the 
fullblown disease out of the hospital 
but few drugs have any impact on the inexorable ravages of the 
virus 
i think this is a particularly insane profession very 
strenuous where youre always facing insurmountable odds said 
ed 36 who works in the nursing end of aids research running drug 
trials for the community research initiative 
working in a field like this keeping that separation between 
personal and professional keeping some control over your life it 
really is a skill a lot of people do burn out but to stay in 
it you really have to develop those boundaries for yourself 
there have been many times in their lives when the boundaries 
between their personal and professional lives have disappeared 
lost in their passion for their cause 
after ellen resigned she and ed went to st clares a small 
aging roman catholic hospital tucked into manhattans tough hells 
kitchen neighborhood 
there in the citys first dedicated aids unit they worked 
14hour days creating what would become a model for other hospitals 
the two of them were the entire nursing staff a pair with 
distinctly different yet complementary styles shes intense 
matteroffact a doer who exudes confidence and competence hes 
more easygoing a lowkey observer who seems quietly selfassured 
they also were newlyweds spending 24 hours a day together 
supporting each other fighting the tough fight and loving it 
we spent more time together working than we ever have ellen 
said we were fighting for a cause together something we were 
both committed to 
it was a tremendous task and a thankless job ed said but 
by doing it by putting ourselves in that situation we got the 
opportunity to learn how the system really works how to start a 
new program and make it fit into a hospital thats very resistant 
to change 
at first the doctors wouldnt come to their floor the 
housekeepers wouldnt come the xray technicians wouldnt come 
the kitchen served patients meals on paper trays the fear was 
palpable 
gradually that changed as the years passed staffers who had 
resented mandatory aids education classes that ellen taught began 
asking for them what never changed was the relative youth of the 
patients many of them vital people at the height of their careers 
and the inevitability of their deterioration we both ended up 
getting involved with special patients who for one reason or 
another became very close to us ellen said we were able to 
support each other through their deaths 
as patients have become their friends over the years so some of 
their friends have become patients 
for months the altmanns took turns nursing a friend who 
required daily care they were the only ones he would allow 
administer his twicedaily intravenous medication 
either ed or ellen would visit him in the morning before work 
and the other would come in the evening they kept their home 
stocked with iv supplies in case he was visiting their queens 
neighborhood 
we never made any plans that didnt include seeing him or 
communicating with him in some way ellen said we restricted 
our lives based on how he was feeling because we always wanted to 
be available 
it was really stressful and there were times we were angry 
we shouldnt have gotten so involved but how could we not she 
said adding that their care helped the friend avoid two or three 
hospitalizations he died in january 
i dont regret any of it ellen said even though at times 
it seemed overwhelming for him to be so dependent on us and us to 
have all our social plans revolved around his care i would not 
have done it any differently 
still the days are gone when they would unhesitatingly dedicate 
every spare minute to aids care with little thought to their 
personal lives now ed spends two days a week at home with their 
20monthold son joshua and ellen makes it a point to work 
regular hours and spend evenings and weekends with her family 
but the nature of their work the intensity of the demands the 
inevitability of death means they always will need to look to 
each other for special support 
when youre talking to a friend who is not a nurse and they 
ask what do you do i cant possibly answer that ellen said 
i can talk to you for weeks and weeks and weeks and you still 
wouldnt understand all the things i do as a nurse and ed 
understands 
sometimes ed said just a couple of words and i know 
exactly what shes going through

young love blossomed two years ago at a hospital 
detox center sara and rafael were both 20 both shooting heroin 
and cocaine both looking for a way out they found each other 
when we started he was determined to stop drugs said sara 
who didnt want her real name used i would go get high and i 
would curse him out he would say come on we can change 
together 
the detox program didnt change them but 18 months ago they 
joined the addiction research amp treatment corps heterosexual and 
hiv transmission study the fiveyear study involves counseling and 
periodic followups participants are tested for exposure to the 
aids virus 
sara tested positive rafael did not and that changed 
everything 
i felt cheated she said thinking of the moment when she 
read the results here i am getting my life together and this 
is happening to me 
she went crazy said rafael who also did not want his name 
used she said she was going to get high again that day she said 
she was going to do drugs i was watching her because i was 
nervous she was going to do something crazy something stupid 
she cried and he held her i love you he told her it 
doesnt matter 
but saras anger and confusion were overwhelming for a month 
she washed her dishes in bleach for fear her nieces or nephews 
would somehow catch the virus from her she wouldnt let anyone 
touch her she couldnt believe rafael wanted to stay with her 
i tell him that if i had found out he had it i would have 
left him sara said 
and i tell her not everybodys the same you got your 
feelings ive got mine rafael replied i know she got hurt 
knowing that she got it im going to treat her bad too i didnt 
treat her bad and she wanted to go kill herself anyway imagine if 
i had said im leaving you now maybe she would have done it 
sara knows when she was exposed she shared a needle with her 
older sister who had said she carried the aids virus sara didnt 
believe her now it is rafael who has a hard time believing 
he doesnt face it he doesnt face it at all to him this is 
like a flu thats going to get better sara said he says i 
know youre not going to die he doesnt face it at all and we 
talk about this every day that he has to accept it that im going 
to get sick and that he has to go on with his life 
he says its not true dont worry about it youre going to 
keep living i say please listen to me this is happening to 
us he doesnt want to hear it 
about 20 percent of the 12236 women with aids in the united 
states are hispanic like sara even though hispanics make up just 
7 percent of the population more than half of those women 
contracted aids through needlesharing like sara and her sister 
if we had both had it it would have been ok but he didnt 
have it and i felt like i was depriving him of his life i told 
him that day do your life you can find somebody else said 
sara who grew up in the bronx and now lives with rafael in her 
mothers house 
this browneyed man with the soft voice and gentle ways is the 
best thing in her life the worst thing is the possibility that she 
might infect him 
i dont want to get him sick thats my biggest fear it would 
be worse for me to know i got him sick than to know im sick 
myself 
the risk of contracting aids is at least 15 times greater for 
black and hispanic heterosexuals than for white heterosexuals 
heterosexual contact between intravenous drug users and their 
partners is spreading the virus faster than any other transmission 
mode with the number of those cases up 27 percent from 1988 to 
1989 
sara and rafael know the risks rafael told their counselor 
regina phillips that he was afraid he would hurt saras feelings 
if he insisted on using condoms now it is sara who insists often 
without success 
he doesnt want to protect himself i bought all kinds of 
them 7 for one of them he wont use them she said it 
wouldnt hurt me if he uses them it would hurt me more if he got 
sick that would kill me 
sara has an associate degree in business administration but she 
cant work she looks healthy behind her bright lipstick and 
pinkframed glasses but she has lost almost 20 pounds and spends 
many days trying to sleep off her weakness and fatigue 
i dont have no future she said but later talked about the 
simple wedding they plan for august and her desire to sharpen her 
typing skills get a job and become involved in religion 
if i get it in my head that theres hope that maybe ill do 
better and it doesnt come her voice trails off i know 
im going to get sick its going to happen eventually so i take 
one day at a time one day at a time some days i feel strong some 
days i dont 
i live that day and i thank god that night that i lived that 
day

vladimir zhironovsky chairman of the liberal 
democrats conducts interviews on a park bench not in an office 
his party couldnt afford an office even if one were available 
we dont have any money we dont have any press we dont 
have any advertising he said on the bench in a quiet shady 
corner of sokolniki park in northeast moscow 
nikolai travkin a plainspoken former communist party member 
who is forming a populist movement incites disgruntled citizens to 
throw out his former comrades the russian social democrats are 
looking for coalition partners and communists need not apply 
dozens of parties have formed since the communists and the 
national legislature agreed in february to end the partys monopoly 
on power the political spectrum ranges from monarchist to 
anarchist but the communist party remains dominant 
communist reformer vyacheslav n shostakovsky said the newcomers 
present a sideshow of protoparties while a struggle for 
control goes on in the 19million member organization that has 
ruled the soviet union since 1917 
travkin agrees what counts is not the number of parties but 
their ability to mount a nationwide challenge to the communists 
you can create as many parties as you want but the communist 
party will strangle them like chickens he told supporters at a 
rally 
in pressing for an end to the constitutional monopoly of power 
president mikhail s gorbachev said the communists would struggle 
for the status of the ruling party rather than having it 
guaranteed 
whatever the theory the party still controls newspapers radio 
and television 
it has lost none of the vast staff and organizational experience 
built up over 70 years and party cells in factories ministries 
the military and kgb secret police have not been eliminated 
opponents of the communists have none of those advantages but 
also lack the partys big disadvantage a legacy of repression and 
mismanagement that is an easy target to attack 
oleg rumyantsev said his social democrats are morally and 
politically opposed to the ideology and practical ways of 
revolutionary communism epitomized by the bolsheviks the party 
will consider a coalition with anyone except the communists he 
told the interfax news service 
zhironovsky of the liberal democrats is a lawyer and proponent 
of free markets who has spent years on the edge of the dissident 
movement 
he believes the soviet communists are going the way of eastern 
europes failed regimes 
the question is how they are going to leave and when he 
said 
many prominent people criticize the communist party but forcing 
it out will not be easy 
no big names have joined the small opposition groups telephones 
and apartments are so scarce there is no place for zhironovsky to 
put the liberal democrat headquarters so he splits it between his 
apartment and his office at a publishing house 
he hopes that in the interests of political stability the 
communists will decide to hand over some of their plentiful office 
space without a regular headquarters he said it is impossible 
for his 9000member group to maintain regular contacts even with 
legislators 
lawmakers have a mass of other problems and theyre going to 
spend two or three days looking for me he asked 
the communist reformer shostakovsky said small parties do not 
yet pose a serious challenge and the main contest is between 
reformers and conservatives within the communist party 
there are monarchists in the party as strange as it seems 
and there are anarchists said shostakovsky rector of moscows 
higher party school he is a leader of democratic platform 
reformers who want the party leadership to abandon the idea of 
leading and organizing the entire society 
other members include boris n yeltsin just elected president 
of the russian federation historian yuri afanasiev and gavriil 
popov mayor of moscow 
some kind of party split is almost certain a struggle now is 
under way for control of the party center and with it the majority 
of members 
shostakovsky fears an attempt to seize control by party 
hardliners who accused gorbachevs economic advisers in documents 
published may 13 of intending to dismantle soviet socialism they 
condemned private enterprise legalization of accumulating 
capital thirst for profit and individualism 
a national party central committee document criticized 
democratic platform this spring for threatening to split the party 
if it cannot force reform the differences probably will come to a 
head at the 28th party congress beginning july 2 and it is not 
certain what direction gorbachev will take 
shostakovsky said he did not expect gorbachev to propose great 
changes if none occurred he said democratic platform would leave 
and take 500000 to 600000 supporters along 
it would be the largest opposition group by far but still a 
dwarf beside the mother party 
despite the prominence of many of its members democratic 
platform would face many of the difficulties confronted by other 
opposition groups most of its supporters are intellectuals and 
highly skilled workers and shostakovsky acknowledged it had 
virtually no support in the countryside 
democratic platform probably would cooperate with gorbachev as 
much as possible playing the role of a loyal opposition rather 
than trying to take power away from him 
travkin whose populist message has found an audience with 
radical workers has been a member of democratic platform and still 
has a partnership relationship with it shostakovsky said 
he added however that travkin was pressing too hard there 
is a taste of confrontation about it extremely tough 
confrontation he said 
as for travkin he said his populist democratic party of russia 
wants to replace local communist leaders not engage in endless 
round tables to negotiate issues 
shostakovsky said opponents may be surprised by the communists 
staying power 
they have watched sovietinspired parties in eastern europe 
quickly reduced to demoralized minority parties he said but 
communism was imposed there and was homegrown in the soviet union

north dakota voters decide whether to raise the sales tax from 
5 percent to 6 percent for a year to bail out education 
maine has primaries in both parties to pick nominees for the 
congressional seat held by democrat joseph e brennan he is giving

the arkansas runoff was required when ralph forbes 50yearold 
evangelist for the sword of the lord good news ministries polled 
46 percent of the vote in the may 29 primary short of the majority 
needed to win the nomination the secondplace finisher with 36 
percent was kenneth muskie harris who previously lost bids

directors 
in listening to folks who i know are republicans and talking 
to them they are not very enamored with either candidate said 
bill paschall a little rock political consultant they wished a 
stronger candidate had stepped forward now its a matter of the 
best of the weak 
forbes believes that whites and blacks would be better off under 
separate governments in an interview sunday with the arkansas 
democrat he proclaimed that white christian americans are the 
true lost tribe of israel and said that the sight of an 
interracial couple turns my stomach 
virtually every prominent republican in the state has endorsed 
harris 36 an executive with a company that manufactures hair care 
products for blacks 
sheffield nelson the gop gubernatorial nominee ran tv

the indians last year won rights to much of the water in 
westcentral wyoming now their destiny is no longer entirely in 
the hands of the white man who relegated them to the 25 
millionacre reservation in the mid1800s 
look how many years weve taken the back seat to everything 
says burton hutchinson northern arapaho tribal chairman were 
the ones in the drivers seat now it feels good real good real 
nice 
the us supreme court last year ruled that an 1868 treaty gave 
the northern arapahos and shoshones priority rights to 500000 
acrefeet of water from the wind river roughly twice what the 
6000 indians previously controlled an acrefoot is enough to 
cover an acre to a depth of one foot 
among other things the indians hope to attract tourists and 
anglers to the river by maintaining the flow rather than diverting 
water to irrigation in dry times 
i want to see the day when every tribal member who wants to 
work can said wes martel cochairman of the shoshone business 
council 
i want to see the day when everyone on the reservation who 
wants an education can get one when the elders can get the medical 
care they need and when the reservation stands out as an example of 
what can be done when people can plan for the future he added 
and this water is the key to all of that 
however the indians newfound wealth has brought them into 
conflict with nonindian farmers on the reservation 
in the past indians and nonindians shared water in dry times 
but after the supreme court ruling the tribes began making sure 
their water rights were observed before sending water to the 
nonindian farmers some of whose ancestors homesteaded the area 
with federal assurances they would have water 
in early may when runoff was scarce the tribes shut off water 
to about 30 nonindians in a section that relies on canals for 
water from the wind 
its pretty frustrating to watch your sprinkler sit there idle 
while your neighbor sits there and uses 12000 gallons of water to 
irrigate land covered mostly with foxtails said fran fox a 
nonindian farmer 
each day you watch water go down the river that should be in 
your canal said another farmer tim shell before this 
started we shared water by rotation and we all survived the rules 
have changed now some are prospering and some will be a lot worse 
off 
to alleviate disputes last year the state paid the tribes 53 
million to secure water for the nonindian irrigators 
but efforts to reach another agreement for this year broke down 
in february with the state saying the price the indians were 
asking was too high 
reservation hydrologist catherine vandemoer said the indians are 
not obligated to give the nonindians any water at all and she 
said that as runoff increases this spring enough water should be 
available for everyone 
they will be fine the rest of the summer she said these 
people really have nothing to worry about 
but the nonindian farmers complain that the lack of water has 
already cost them barley and hay 
we are talking about 65 to 70 bushels of barley per acre as 
opposed to 100 fox said my hay will be less than half of a 
crop 
nonindians on the reservation have no representation we are 
disenfranchised fox said we are feeling a little lonely 
martel said the indians are trying to manage the water in a way 
that will improve the reservations economy 
weve got to do something to alleviate the 70 percent 
unemployment and provide health care for our people who are not 
getting it said martel 
if we didnt have such potential things here would be a 
little depressing we are just trying to protect what little we 
have left

farmers soon may have an environmentally safe 
alternative to pesticides swarms of tiny wasps trained for 
searchanddestroy missions against two of the nations most 
destructive crop pests 
researchers at a us department of agriculture laboratory in 
tifton are experimenting with odors and colors to enhance the 
wasps natural bloodhound ability to locate corn ear and tobacco 
bud worms 
the two caterpillars attack at least 100 plants including corn 
cotton soybeans and tomatoes they are members of the heliothis 
pest family blamed for more than 1 billion in crop losses each 
year 
joe lewis an entomologist with the usdas agricultural research 
service and visiting dutch student felix wackers are raising small 
wasps known as microplitis croceipes they are natural enemies of 
heliothis insects but do not harm humans 
the heliothis pests often try to evade the enemies by hiding in 
crevices of plants and leaving decoy sites with their scents 
the wasps are like detectives lewis said theyre 
monitoring eavesdropping by understanding how they identify clues 
that signal the caterpillars presence we can turn them into an 
asset 
the female wasp deposits an egg inside the caterpillar while 
stinging the egg hatches into a larva feeds inside the host and 
eventually kills the caterpillar the larva then leaves and spins a 
cocoon in which it develops into a wasp 
as the wasps emerge from the cocoon the caterpillar odor left 
on the cocoon is sensed by the wasp and used later to locate hosts 
for its eggs lewis said 
to use wasps to kill pests large numbers will have to be raised 
in laboratories but if you released them in a cornfield and they 
didnt have any training for worms they might fly off to another 
field said wackers 
so the researchers are using pavlovian techniques to make the 
wasps more efficient killers they have conditioned wasps to 
recognize the odor of caterpillar feces and pick out cues such as 
the color and shape of a cotton bloom 
wasps that received caterpillars as rewards were 90 percent 
effective in choosing the correct odors and colored cards in flight 
chamber tests similar results were achieved when wasps were 
released in small plots 
we can program them to seek a certain kind of plant and a 
certain part of the plant in searching for pests said lewis 
wasps are already used for pest control in greenhouses in europe 
and the united states it has always been assumed that insect 
behavior was determined by instinct but lewis said his tests have 
shown the wasps can be trained 
in one experiment he taught them to associate the smell of 
vanilla with caterpillars 
our ability to train them to respond to such novel and 
otherwise unattractive odors demonstrates the remarkable capacity 
of these wasps to learn lewis said 
the researchers estimate that by 1995 parasitic wasps could be 
sent out to patrol fullsized fields

texas sen phil gramm knows the rewards of 
having the national rifle association as an ally michael dukakis 
on the other hand knows what its like to lead the nras list of 
enemies 
the organization uses its cashrich political action committee 
to support its political allies and in the past has dug deep into 
its coffers to attack candidates it views as opponents 
the current senate debate over a major crime bill that includes 
bans on nine categories of semiautomatic weapons is the latest test 
of the nras clout 
the association won a round last thursday when it got enough 
votes to stall action on the bill but it likely will be tested 
again in the coming weeks as even republican lawmakers considered 
staunch nra allies seek a compromise so the congress can pass an 
electionyear crime bill 
history says the nra will remember the votes come fall and its 
pac has the money to affect campaigns holding more than 631000 
at the end of may according to federal election commission records 
the pac raised 12 million in the 15 months ending in march 
the 24th best showing among more than 4500 registered committees 
and already had donated 320000 to congressional candidates in the 
1990 cycle 
like many wealthy pacs it not only gives directly to candidates 
but also uses media ads and mail appeals to influence targeted 
campaigns 
gramm a conservative republican who is a natural nra ally 
received 9900 directly from the pac for his 1984 election 
campaign it also spent 327850 on an independent drive to support 
his candidacy 
dukakis the massachusetts governor and 1988 democratic 
presidential nominee was on the other end of an nra 
independentexpenditure campaign 
fec records show the nra spent more than 15 million against 
dukakis much of that on radio ads and direct mail appeals that 
accused dukakis of vowing to disarm his state 
dukakis said the ads distorted his views and at one point he 
threatened to sue the nra still his campaign was forced to 
counter with ads of its own diverting valuable campaign money and 
air time 
fec records show most of the 37 senators whose vote helped the 
nras position in the senate last thursday have received campaign 
help from the organization 
over the past six years the nra has spent nearly 700000 on 
behalf of 33 of the 37 senators according to fec records the 
sixyear period was chosen because 1984 was the last time some 
senators were up for reelection 
more than 240000 of the spending by the nras political 
committee was in the form of campaign donations to the 33 the 
nras pac spent an additional 440000 on advertising and other 
independent efforts to support of five of the 33 including the 
nearly 330000 spent to support gramm 
the thursday vote came on a motion to limit the length of debate 
on the crime bill with the senate leadership falling three short 
of the 60 votes it needed 
supporting the leadership in that unsuccessful effort were 21 
senators who in the past six years have received financial help 
from the nra 
the records show that nra spent more than 240000 on behalf of 
the 21 112600 in direct contributions and 130450 on 
independent efforts to support four of the 21 
ten of the 21 lawmakers sided with the nra two weeks ago when an 
amendment that would have removed the gun controls from the 
legislation failed on a 5248 vote but last week the 10 sided with 
the leadership in trying to limit debate 
among them was sen arlen specter rpa who according to fec 
records benefited from a 112000 nra independent expenditure 
campaign in 1986 
specter is coauthor of a provision in the bill designed to speed 
up certain executions and his vote thursday was interpreted more 
as an effort to keep the overall crime bill alive than as a rebuke 
to the nra 
also among the 10 lawmakers who supported the nra stance earlier 
but sided with the leadership last week was sen strom thurmond of 
south carolina ranking republican on the judiciary committee who 
has received 15000 from the nra over the past six years 
if the bill clears the senate with the bans on semiautomatic 
weapons the nras lobbying effort will shift to the house where 
it also has dozens of staunch allies the nras pac has donated 
more than 2 million to house candidates in the past six years 
but its chances of deleting the bans from the legislation in the 
house are not considered as strong as in the senate democrats 
generally supportive of the bans hold a bigger majority in the 
house and the rules of that chamber forbid filibusters

if voters are truly outraged about the big pay 
raise the house gave itself theyre not registering it at the only 
place that really counts the ballot box 
the bulk of the primary election season was completed as of last 
tuesday and the results show that not one incumbent was defeated 
because of a vote for the raise which will boost house salaries to 
about 125000 in january 1991 from the current 96600 
only one incumbent lost for any reason and that was rep donald 
e buz lukens rohio whose party abandoned him after he was 
convicted of sexual improprieties with a minor 
its not that challengers didnt try to use the pay issue in 
fact a handful of veteran democrats had close calls where the pay 
issue was used against them most notably rep john murtha of 
pennsylvania 
the chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees the 
nations military spending and a payraise booster murtha 
received barely more than 50 percent of the vote in defeating a 
littleknown and thinly financed opponent 
for a few days last month after murthas scare the capitol was 
abuzz was the pay issue bigger than they thought if someone as 
powerful as murtha be brought to his knees was any not vulnerable 
but now that talk has settled down 
political analysts found other local reasons at the root of 
murthas troubles and some other democrats who expected primary 
trouble have came through with biggerthanexpected margins despite 
their payraise votes 
any member of congress who is doing a good job responsive to 
his or her district and is well loved by the district will not be 
defeated by his or her vote on the pay raise said howard 
schloss spokesman for the democratic congressional campaign 
committee 
they all won and thats the bottom line said rep vic 
fazio dcalif who spearheaded the drive last year for the pay 
raise and ethicsreform legislation i really believe the issue 
is behind us 
that high level of confidence is due in part to something 
known on capitol hill but not widely known elsewhere before 
passing the pay raise last year the two parties agreed not to use 
it against each others candidates 
for the intraparty warfare of the primary elections that pact 
didnt apply but it will in november so the feeling is that 
house incumbents have already withstood the toughest shots 
fazio says the heat is now on the senate which rejected the big 
25 percent increase the house gets next year and decided instead to 
let its members keep taking fees of up to 2000 a speech from 
specialinterest groups several senators have promised to try 
again this year to ban such honoraria 
fazio cites california voters strong 62 percent approval last 
week of proposition 112 which would prohibit state lawmakers from 
accepting money for speeches and set up a commission to set pay 
increases 
the house voted to ban speech honoraria beginning next year as 
part of the pay deal and there are other similarities with 
california for example the strong opposition to both plans by 
consumer activist ralph nader 
nader and others remain confident the issue will heat up again 
for the fall election several top political analysts have wondered 
aloud if the pay raise wont feed into a general mood of discontent 
among the voters 
history is a poor guide on this one 
congressional quarterly researched the issue recently and found 
that voters did indeed toss members out in droves when they passed 
big pay increases in 1816 and 1873 
but in 1855 and a century later in 1955 pay increases of 50 
percent and 80 percent were passed without resulting in any great 
electoral turmoil 
the feeling in the capitol based on the primary results is 
that 1990 is looking a lot like 1955

activists on both sides of the abortion 
issue see iowas gubernatorial and us senate races as a test 
tube in which to develop campaign strategies that can be put to 
work elsewhere 
the dividing lines sharpened last week when democrats nominated 
prochoice house speaker don avenson to run against firstterm 
republican gov terry branstad who opposes abortion 
the states senate race also matches up candidates on opposing 
sides of the abortion issue antiabortion republican rep tom 
tauke is hoping to oust sen tom harkin who is prochoice on 
abortion 
iowa is one of the most important states in terms of 
gubernatorial races and senate races said loretta ucelli of the 
national abortion rights action league or naral the stakes are 
very high there 
mona smit of the iowa right to life committee said the november 
elections now become a high priority as iowans now have a clear 
choice 
activists on both sides of the abortion issue say they will wage 
highprofile campaigns in iowa which holds the nations first test 
of presidential strength political tactics often get a trial run 
in iowa before being put into play elsewhere 
iowa is sort of a test tube for campaign strategy and 
techniques said joe shanahan a spokesman for the iowa 
democratic party we have pretty much a fulltime campaign going 
on 
both democratic candidates harkin and avenson say they will 
make their prochoice positions an important part of the fall 
campaigns 
i dont think we can beat terry branstad unless we offer 
voters a contrast avenson said of the governors race 
all eyes are going to be on iowa this year harkin said 
this is the one senate race where there is a clearcut 
difference 
last weeks primary was the first election in the state since 
the us supreme court last year gave states more freedom to 
restrict abortion 
prochoice activists said avensons primary election victory 
over antiabortion attorney general tom miller demonstrated the 
political clout of the abortion issue miller began the race as the 
prohibitive favorite after a dozen years in office but plummeted in 
the polls as he was hammered on abortion 
if naral hadnt been out there we would have had tom miller 
as the candidate said shelley bain of the iowa naral affiliate 
branstad and tauke discounted the role of abortion in the 
outcome 
tom miller waffled all over the court branstad said you 
wont find me doing that 
tauke said voters in iowa are sophisticated and unlikely to cast 
their ballots on a single issue 
essentially the miller campaign didnt give people a reason 
to vote for him he said 
republican sen charles grassley who is not up for reelection 
this year said only hardcore activists are moved by the abortion 
issue 
those are really farout people and they represent about 10 
percent to 15 percent of the electorate he said 
but prochoice advocates point to other signs the states 
electorate is on their side they say polls find more than 60 
percent of those surveyed identify with the prochoice label they 
also point to the victory of prochoice democrat eric tabor in a 
congressional primary in taukes district 
in addition a series of attempts to enact restrictions in the 
legislature failed by 21 margins last winter a good barometer of 
public opinion they say 
republicans reject the suggestion abortion will cause them 
problem this fall 
if abortion hurts tom tauke or terry branstad it will be 
because they fail to talk about other issues in a way that moves 
people said iowa republican party spokesman mike day

this affluent republican city in 
conservative orange county has ended a strange political marriage 
ousting a democratic mayor schooled in 60s activism who put the 
environment gay rights and foreign affairs on the municipal agenda 
the days of blaring national headlines like irvine and the 
ozone city sets out to save the planet are over but larry agran 
has left his mark on the community 
agran 45 a 12year city councilman who two years ago became 
the first directly elected mayor of the city of 110000 lost to 
councilwoman sally anne sheridan by 860 votes tuesday previously 
the mayor was appointed by the council 
weve been on a very ambitious progressive course agran 
said thursday i think that has political costs associated with 
it 
the voters also rejected two of agrans council allies 
restoring a conservative majority 
hed lost touch with our community they felt it was time for 
a change to get back to the realities of running city 
government said sheridan 55 a real estate agent elected to the 
council in 1984 they didnt like the city of irvine being used 
for an international political agenda 
if the citys name does not get into the paper for the next 
year i will not be unhappy she said 
agran a lawyer educated at harvard and the university of 
california at berkeley during the 1960s managed to hold power in a 
southern california county and city where republicans outnumber 
democrats 21 only three of the countys 29 mayors are registered 
democrats 
he initially succeeded because his blend of fiscal conservatism 
and social liberalism appealed to traditional conservatives said 
mark petracca an agran supporter and political science professor 
at the university of california at irvine 
that conservative constituency supported his intention to use 
government to do social good petracca said 
agrans approach to social change was broad even global in 
scope as he tried to set an example for municipal activism 
he successfully fought for environmental measures ranging from 
curbside recycling and openspace preservation to stringent 
restrictions on the use of chloroflurocarbons and other industrial 
chemicals that damage the ozone 
he pursued an ambitious masstransit plan focusing on a 
countywide monorail system the 250 million proposal also provided 
a model for shifting the defense industry toward civilian projects 
as military spending decreases agran said 
under agran the city aggressively pursued business and cultural 
ties with foreign countries particularly those in the pacific rim 
and the mayor made a postwar trip to vietnam to try to reunite 
five irvinearea vietnamese families with relatives lost after the 
fall of saigon 
some in irvine including sheridan accused agran of ignoring 
pothole projects in favor of esoteric international issues 
agran denied that and said he was advancing issues that 
concerned residents on both a personal and political level 
a human rights ordinance enacted under agran stirred opposition 
christian fundamentalists and others opposed the ordinance 
because it barred discrimination against homosexuals among other 
groups voters in november removed the protection for gay people 
despite agrans call for tolerance 
petracca suggested that such political controversy simply 
doesnt fit the nature of the community which the 1980 census 
showed to have a median income 37 percent above the countys 
22802 
most of the people want to be left alone to their little house 
and plot of grass thats why they moved to irvine petracca 
said you want political action you move to chicago 
agran also said he believes a 25000 lastminute mailer sent 
out by a county gop organization tipped the balance the mailer 
included a reprint of an article that labeled him the evil 
emperor of irvine 
sheridan said some of agrans programs were valuable and 
probably would remain 
agran said another run for office is unlikely in the short term 
but he had no regrets about his activist tenure 
i think in many respects we have changed the political 
landscape he said

the senate agriculture committee is going 
public this week with its disputes over price supports in the 1990 
farm bill 
meanwhile the counterpart panel in the house is wrapping up its 
version of the legislation that sets agriculture policy for the 
next five years with completion of the conservation section of the 
bill 
both debates are scheduled for tuesday the house plan is to 
have a bill on the floor by june 25 the senate is not as 
optimistic 
the big stumbling block in the senate is over commodities most 
problems with other sections were resolved in closed meetings 
between the democratic and republican staffs and quickly approved 
in open sessions of the committee 
when the staffs couldnt resolve the commodity price support 
problems committee chairman patrick leahy dvt appointed a 
working group of himself and sens bob kerrey dneb david pryor 
dark richard lugar rind bob dole rkan and thad cochran 
rmiss 
when that group couldnt solve the problems leahy decided to 
settle the matter through voting in open session 
i think we will end up getting a bill reported out kerrey 
said last friday it wont be what lugar wants it wont be 
exactly what i want 
kerrey took the lead among the democrats in the committee who 
proposed increasing price supports by 1 percent in 1991 and 
allowing other increases in the four subsequent years based on 
inflation rates 
lugars proposal represented the bush administrations position 
that price supports should be frozen at 1990 levels the house bill 
also calls for a freeze 
kerrey said his proposal would cost 13 billion in 1991 even 
though we only got 106 billion from the budget committee 
he said leahy had told him he wouldnt take a bill to the full 
committee unless it had support of all the democrats on the panel 
was within the budget and could bring in some of the republicans 
i think we have every disagreement settled except for the loan 
rates kerrey said 
lugar told reporters early last week that he would not accept 
anything other than a freeze in target prices and loan rates he 
said if democrats wanted to make an issue of it they would find 
themselves in a floor battle that could lead to a oneyear 
extension of current law instead of a fiveyear program 
the administration wants a oneyear extension kerrey said 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has said repeatedly that 
an extension would be acceptable because international trade talks 
to be completed in december could create a need for a change in 
support policies anyway

animal rights activists would end up in 
federal prison if they attack farms or research labs under 
legislation up for a vote this week in the house agriculture 
committee 
it brings the full weight of our laws against the extremists 
who have gotten out of control said rep charles stenholm 
dtexas sponsor of the measure which is similar to a bill 
approved by the senate last november 
he said it applies only to crimes considered terrorist 
attacks he wants it included in the 1990 farm bill 
the measure applies to facilities or premises where an animal is 
kept for food fiber production agriculture research testing or 
education 
it makes it a federal crime to 
disrupt the activities of the premises 
steal or damage property or animals 
enter a facility with the intent to commit a violation 
remain in a facility despite notice that entry was forbidden 
violators could be fined up to 10000 and jailed for up to 
three years or both 
any person harmed by a violation may recover actual and 
consequential damages and court costs 
no matter how good and righteous you think your cause is you 
do not have the right to take the law into your own hands said 
stenholm those who choose to disrupt lawful agricultural and 
scientific research activities through violent means should face 
legal sanctions that are commensurate with their actions 
rep charles rose dnc another member of the house 
agriculture committee has proposed an amendment to the animal 
welfare act that would set fines but no jail time for damage to 
research facilities or farms 
it also includes a provision that allows for temporary removal 
of an animal from a research facility to document whether the 
animal is being treated properly according to existing law 
if a person who has broken into a facility proves that animals 
are being mistreated the facility would have to reimburse the 
person who committed the breakin for any court costs 
roses bill also allows people to file lawsuits on behalf of 
animals

almost as though it were an obvious fact some 
blacks questioned as marion barrys potential jurors have been 
telling a judge they believe the washington mayor would not be on 
trial if he were white 
barrys arrest in an elaborate fbi sting operation revived a 
charge that prosecutors systematically go after successful black 
politicians 
benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp estimates that 
80 percent of the black people in washington believe that to be 
true he puts himself in that category too 
mary r sawyer assistant professor of religious studies at iowa 
state university has studied the issue in a 1987 report she 
listed 77 black public officials who she says were subject to 
selective prosecution or some other form of harassment 
among those she lists mayors maynard jackson of atlanta 
coleman young of detroit and richard arrington of birmingham ala 
former mayors carl stokes of cleveland kenneth gibson of newark 
nj and charles evers of fayette miss reps charles rangel 
dny harold ford dtenn and louis stokes dohio and former 
reps shirley chisholm dny and charles diggs dmich 
but as often as the accusation is made prosecutors deny it 
we follow the evidence wherever it leads regardless of 
position race party affiliation or other identifying factors 
attorney general dick thornburgh said last january 
last month he said no one would be more disturbed than i 
would be if it were proven that the justice department engaged in 
racially motivated selective prosecutions 
in court us attorney jay stephens suggested that the 
government went after barry because he is a role model in a city 
that last year saw 438 homicides most of them drugrelated 
barrys arrest is a personal tragedy stephens said but 
narcotics abuse is also a tragedy for this city not a 
victimless crime 
obliquely barry himself makes the charge too 
the prosecutors have been dipping and dabbling in the politics 
of washington for a long time he said in may and complained he 
had been hounded harassed vilified slandered 
the view that barry had been singled out was expressed by some 
potential jurors as the mayors trial on drug and perjury charges 
started last week 
it seems like that some people are made to go through a little 
more than others one potential juror told us district judge 
thomas penfield jackson they televised this too much talked 
about it too much i think race had a lot to do with it as far 
as giving him a hard time 
jackson asked if a white mayor would have been spared 
investigation and prosecution under similar circumstances 
exactly she replied 
she was accepted as a member of the jury pool 
the media can say barrys lifestyle is not appropriate but 
the masses of people perceive that if marion barry were white we 
would not be reading anything about him says clarence mitchell 
iii who served with barry in the student nonviolent coordinating 
committee in the 1960s 
mitchell says he also is a victim of selective prosecution a 
former maryland state legislator he says he was investigated 19 
times in 24 years in public life before being tried with his 
brother michael and convicted on charges of accepting a bribe he 
is appealing 
at the sentencing their mother juanita jackson mitchell 
alluded to the brothers claim that they were victims of an fbi 
vendetta 
my sons are casualties on the road to freedom she said 
the naacps hooks in an interview was careful to avoid passing 
judgment on barry but he drew an analogy if everyone is going 
80 miles an hour on the highway and youre doing 70 and the cops 
stop you youve got to wonder 
joseph agne a consultant to the national council of churches 
suggests that white prosecutors go after blacks as one way to get 
around the gains from the voting rights act its enactment led to 
the election of thousands of black public officials 
last year the church group in a resolution deplored what it 
saw as a concerted effort on the part of law enforcement 
officials to discredit and remove african american elected 
officials from office 
but richard a samp chief counsel for the conservative 
washington legal foundation says an increase in investigations of 
black officeholders was inevitable corruption generally occurs at 
the local level samp says and thats where blacks generally have 
been winning elections 
and louis michael seidman law professor at georgetown 
university points to a 19th century supreme court decision that 
selective prosecution to make an example of a conspicuous 
lawbreaker for example is permissible as long as it is not

the directors of the 1990 us census can on 
a clear day see one of their biggest nightmares from their office 
windows 
residents of the nations capital are down near the bottom of 
the list when it comes to doing their census duty theyre behind 
every state and are 29th out of the countrys 32 biggest cities in 
cooperating with the head count 
it looks like the national drive to convince people its their 
civic duty to fill those census forms out went straight past the 
federal governments back yard 
this is a world capital city john connelly an assistant to 
the director of the census said last week there are people from 
all over the world here you have a lot of immigrants a lot of 
hispanics in the greater washington area 
language differences and distrust of the federal government are 
among the major barriers census officials have cited in getting 
people to do the decennial task 
most of our major cities were low said russell davis a 
spokesman in the census bureaus promotion office 
but hardly any so low as the district of columbia which also 
boasts the nations highest concentration of government workers 
as of june 5 the census bureau reported a 76 percent response 
rate from the district and that followed doortodoor questioning 
by census counters after only 57 percent of the citys households 
mailed their forms in 
the bureau reported a national 91 percent response rate as of 
last week 
every state was above 80 percent and iowans were the closest to 
putting the counting behind them with a 978 percent response 
i wouldnt say the district is especially disappointing 
said connelly but sure there are probably comments going 
around that a lot of people here work for the federal government 
and ought to know what the census is for 
kay hixson a spokeswoman for mayor marion barry said the city 
has spent some 400000 this spring on the census 
were obviously disappointed the response is not what we had 
hoped she said but she said washingtons unique population 
makeup may actually be hurting the census effort 
we have a substantial transient population with congressional 
people embassies international banks these are things where 
people move in and out and i would suspect that often theyre not 
focused on things critical to the community said hixson 
other cities are having problems however 
boston was the worst of the big cities with a 717 percent 
response rate as of a week ago phoenix ariz was next at 734 
percent and new york city was at 741 percent 
in contrast detroit reported a 934 percent response rate san 
antonio which has a large hispanic population was also at 934 
percent

the 128yearold wreckage of the civil war 
ironclad monitor is fragile but still intact the government said 
as it cleared the way for photographers to venture to the ships 
atlantic grave 
for the first time in 11 years the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration is permitting research dives to the 
ship which sank in a gale 16 miles off cape hatteras nc in 
1862 
armed with a noaa permit photographer and author rod farb of 
cedar grove nc arrived at the site with a film crew last week 
beating out a scubadiving rival 
farb and gary gentile of philadelphia had vied to become the 
first to dive to the ship since french explorer jacques cousteau 
did it in 1979 
gentile still plans to dive to the ship in several weeks but it 
wont be the same said his attorney peter hess 
do you remember the second guy to cross the atlantic he 
said 
gentile had filed 11 permit applications and written more than 
50 letters to noaa since 1984 seeking permission to photograph the 
wreck he won his monitor permit first but decided to wait until 
the weather improved at the end of june to make the trip hess said 
cousteaus expedition was hampered by bad weather and poor 
visibility and little or no usable footage was produced 
but noaa said farb was blessed with good conditions when he and 
his crew made their first dive at the end of last week noaa part 
of the commerce department is responsible for safeguarding the 
wreckage 
accompanied by a noaa representative farb was expected to 
remain at the site for several days and the agency said it did not 
expect him to release any footage right away 
noaa refused to allow monitor dives after cousteaus trip 
saying the 220foot depth posed a serious and unreasonable risk 
that its own divers would not take 
meanwhile some private divers fearing the wreck was in danger 
of collapse lobbied the agency to permit dives before the 
historic ship was lost 
noaa reversed its position after one of its administrative law 
judges ruled last november that the agency exaggerated safety 
concerns and that a significant number of trained scuba divers 
frequently descend 220 feet 
before permitting farbs dive noaa researchers disclosed friday 
that they descended to the wreck in a submarine on june 12 to make 
a visual record to ensure that artifacts are not tampered with 
later 
the best word to describe the condition is that we believe 
its stable said tim keeney noaa director of ocean and coastal 
resources certainly the hull of the vessel is not made of thick 
metal and there are parts that have caved in however there is 
armor plating surrounding the vessel and that is almost totally 
intact on the port side 
the ships gun turret looks like its in pretty good shape 
keeney said 
the monitor sank after a celebrated battle with the confederate 
ship merrimack in 1862 it was discovered by researchers in 1973 
the merrimack renamed the virginia was destroyed by its crew to 
keep it from being captured by the union 
the monitor appears fragile said irv garrison a noaa marine 
archaeologist who was on the submarine 
time is one thing he said but shes also right in the 
area of a shipping lane and every destroyer that went by may have 
dropped a load on her she might have been depthcharged which 
would be a ironic fate for an old civil war boat

they used to be called scofflaws tax evaders 
black marketeers and worse but theyre getting new dignity now as 
the informal sector and they could be one key to better life 
for people in the third world 
they include a wide range of enterprising people theres the 
little boy in abidjan ivory coast who buys a package of 
cigarettes and sells them one by one on a street corner he pays no 
tax or license fee and makes a small profit 
there are also the 70 families of squatters in a latin american 
capital who stole their electricity when the power company refused 
to sell it 
a study published last week by the private world resources 
institute with two united nations agencies pulled together much of 
the investigation done on what economists have dubbed the informal 
sector 
it said many planners now see it as probably the greatest source 
of new jobs in third world cities 
in the year 2000 mexico city is expected to have more than 27 
million people and bombay india more than 15 million that gives 
plenty of room for volunteer groups that in many places already 
help supply drinking water sanitation small loans and even 
recycling services 
by the standards of industrialized countries the pay or profit 
is low but even in what the world bank calls uppermiddleincome 
countries such as brazil or malaysia the average income is around 
2000 a year onetenth the us average 
the world bank biggest source of aid to the third world found 
the electricity thieves in an unnamed latin american capital it 
said the leader of a squatter community told of going to the 
manager of the power company and being informed that it could not 
sell to them 
in the end he decided to be indulgent with us in exchange for 
our promise that we would not abuse our arrangement by going too 
far with domestic connections the leader was quoted as saying 
the fact is that we do not pay for electricity now it is 
free and we have been able to light our streets our school and 
our homes if there were anything else that we needed and if the 
government were unwilling to give it to us then we would just take 
it without authorization 
a study published by the johns hopkins university press told of 
shantytown dwellers who collect waste in montevideo uruguay and 
separate the types for recycling but the necessary washing of 
plastics takes too much labor so they farm out that part of the 
job to small family enterprises that can do it more cheaply 
the same study reported that in niamey niger tinsmiths and 
blacksmiths recycled scrap metal and made 30000 stoves in two 
years the efficient stoves cut the consumption of scarce fuel wood 
it estimated that in most third world countries the informal 
sector includes 30 percent to 70 percent of the working population

the mobilization of thousands of people to 
march for animals marks a milestone in the animal rights movement 
activists say 
there is no question we are making progress organizer tom 
regan said sunday after a rally which featured celebrities such as 
singer grace slick and superman movie star christopher reeve 
regan a professor of philosophy at north carolina state 
university said the animal rights movement is one that advocates 
lifestyle changes regan for instance does not eat meat 
us capitol police estimated 24000 people attended the first 
march for the animals along with a rally on the steps of the 
capitol 
organizers claimed more than 50000 people from around the 
country showed up for the onemile march down pennsylvania avenue 
to the capitol 
marchers chanted animal rights now many carried banners 
and placards with pictures and slogans saying things such as 
animals are not for wearing fur is dead and animals 
have rights too 
some brought their dogs 
peter linck of the national alliance for animal legislation said 
the rally was a show of unity among diverse groups that advocate a 
range of programs from saving elephants in the wild and banning 
furs to ending use of animals in medical research and changing the 
way veal is produced 
the most controversial position of animal rights activists deals 
with their opposition to use of animals in medical research a 
view the nations top health officials say is misguided out of 
step with the position of a majority of responsible members of the 
scientific community and a potential threat to medical advances 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan has 
criticized animal rights advocates who use violence and 
intimidation to block testing of animals they are on the wrong 
side of morality he said last week 
sullivan said some of the greatest advances in medicine such as 
the cure for polio never would have been achieved had animals not 
been used in tests 
dr frederick goodwin head of the us alcohol drug abuse and 
mental health administration said in an interview sunday that 
animals provide the critical linchpin between the petri dish and 
people 
tests using animals are employed about 20 percent of the time by 
biomedical researchers he said without those tests advances in 
finding a cure for aids for instance would stop he said 
but slick once the lead singer for the jefferson starship 
group said she was opposed to animal testings in laboratories 
im for all angles of animal rights slick said 
rep tom lantos dcalif head of the informal congressional 
friends of animals group said he opposes the unnecessary 
duplicative and cruel use of animals in medical and other areas 
barbara huffman of freemont wis president of the american 
veal association said she was angry about allegations that veal 
producers are cruel to animals activists claim the calves are 
chained and forcefed drugladen food before their slaughter at age 
four months 
we are producing a safe and plentiful food supply she said 
we provide the best care for our animals that we can 
several bills pending in congress deal with the animal rights 
issue among then is one to protect animals in testing of 
cosmetics one to prohibit the confinement of veal calves in small 
crates and another to end hunting and trapping on wildlife refuges 
a separate bill would impose jail terms on activists who attack 
farms or research labs 
among the groups participating in the march were the american 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals people for the 
ethical treatment of animals the us humane society and the doris 
day animal league

each friday they march circling the 
front steps of the courthouse with signs protesting the 
firstdegree murder conviction of a black teenager by an allwhite 
jury 
in massachusetts that conviction means life without parole 
almost unheard of in a homicide stemming from a street fight 
theres nothing on either side to suggest that it was anything 
but happenstance that they came together said david hoose the 
attorney for charles fryar 
the black 18yearold was convicted april 3 of stabbing 
21yearold eric palmer during a confrontation last year between 
black youths and white students from springfield college hoose 
blamed the fight on alcohol and hotheaded youth 
the conviction galvanized blacks in this city of 150000 
sparking two big rallies a fundraising effort that has netted 
more than 7000 and lunchtime vigils outside the hampden county 
hall of justice every friday by up to a dozen people 
i think people are finally tired of the double standard thats 
handed out at the hall of justice said norma baker a leader of 
the africanamerican coalition 
the supreme judicial court in a move unrelated to the fryar 
case has ordered a study of racial and ethnic bias in the states 
legal system 
the vigils have been going on for about six weeks the rev 
edward harding said he plans to keep appearing at them until at 
least sept 11 the trial date for lester jowers the other person 
charged in palmers slaying 
coalition members want to keep the controversy alive while 
fryars appeal moves through the courts 
we expect that were going to have to do this over the next 
couple of years baker said 
the coalition a group of directors of local social service 
agencies has focused on the jury selection system maintaining 
that there are not enough minorities on hampden county juries the 
minority population of springfield is about 30 percent but that 
drops to about 6 percent countywide 
paul carr state jury commissioner defended the massachusetts 
system state law he said requires cities to conduct a census of 
everyone over 17 those names are fed into a computer and jury 
pools are drawn at random 
before budget cutbacks forced the adoption of a mail census the 
springfield election commission used offduty police officers or 
postal workers to compile names by going doortodoor coalition 
members said offduty police officers may intimidate some 
minorities 
in the fryar case only two prospective jurors were black hoose 
said 
prosecutor william t walsh jr who has since left the district 
attorneys office for private practice said he thought the verdict 
was fair and that a different racial makeup on the jury would have 
made no difference 
fryar supporters said theyre not claiming that a black jury 
would have let him off lightly but said hoose an allwhite 
jury is going to relate more on a subtle level to the white 
students who testified 
the lawyer said he did not argue in court that if jurors 
believed fryar guilty they should convict on a charge less serious 
than firstdegree murder because he was bound to follow his 
clients plea of innocence 
theres still a fallback position for appeal which is of 
course even if he did do it its manslaughter and seconddegree 
murder at the worst hoose said

in giving political newcomer alberto fujimori 
a landslide presidential victory the people of this economically 
crippled nation rejected the freemarket shock therapy advocated by 
novelist mario vargas llosa 
fujimori an agronomist and the son of japanese immigrants 
captured sundays runoff by 13 to 19 points according to exit 
polls conducted by independent firms 
official returns were not expected for at least three weeks 
because of poor communication with mountain and jungle regions 
vargas llosa a celebrated novelist conceded defeat three hours 
after polls closed he told supporters he wished fujimori success 
in the difficult responsibility the peruvian people have placed on 
him 
he urged peruvians to put the bitterly fought campaign behind 
them vargas llosa had been the early favorite he won the most 
votes in the first round of voting on april 8 but not the 
majority needed for election 
fujimori a 51yearold former university rector ran a 
shoestring campaign against vargas llosas wellheeled democratic 
front coalition 
a political unknown just months ago fujimori gained the support 
of perus poor protestant evangelists and leftists opposed to 
vargas llosas plans to privatize state industries and lift price 
controls 
he takes charge of a country where four in five people lack a 
steady job annual inflation is 2000 percent and violence related 
to the maoistinspired shining path insurgency has claimed more 
than 18500 lives in the last decade 
i realize it will be a titanic task fujimori said soberly 
sunday night addressing reporters he invited all political 
parties to participate in his government in areas where agreements 
could be reached 
fujimoris critics accused him of ties to the aprista party of 
president alan garcia many people blame the populist policies of 
garcia who by law could not run for reelection for perus 
desperate economic situation 
fujimori who begins his fiveyear term on july 28 in a country 
weathering its worst economic crisis of the century has said 
little about the makeup of his administration he has said 
however that he would not appoint members of the aprista party to 
his cabinet 
vargas llosa 54 had pledged harsh austerity measures to revive 
the economy while fujimori advocated continued price controls and 
subsidies for basic goods and services 
fujimori said his government would stress economic development 
over military and police repression as the best way to fight both 
leftist guerrillas and cocaine trafficking 
he did not indicate where the money would come from for economic 
development the peruvian treasury is 100 million in the red 
peru is the worlds main source of coca leaf the raw material 
for cocaine the us government is pressuring peru to reduce its 
coca production and has offered to send us soldiers to train 
peruvian troops in jungle warfare methods to fight guerrillas 
fujimori said he shared vargas llosas view that peru must be 
reinserted into the world financial community and said he would 
seek to renegotiate perus 20 billion foreign debt 
garcia suspended foreign debt payments early in his government 
and international lending agencies eventually cut off credit to 
peru 
many attributed vargas llosas loss to a multimillion dollar 
media campaign that angered people in this country of 22 million 
people where the average annual income is 900 and the minimum wage 
is 45 a month 
vargas llosa is widely associated by the south american 
countrys indigenous and mixedrace majority with the 
europeandescended coastal elite 
thousands of campaign supporters paraded and celebrated early 
today outside the rundown headquarters of fujimoris change 90 
party in downtown lima 
the independent polling firm apoyo gave fujimori 511 percent of 
the vote to 378 percent for vargas llosa with 111 percent blank 
and null votes pop another independent polling firm showed 
fujimori with 56 percent and vargas llosa 365 percent pop put 
blank and null votes at 75 percent 
nearly 10 million peruvians were registered to vote and the law 
requires them to cast ballots 
as the polls opened sunday armored helicopters crisscrossed 
limas skies tanks and troop carriers patrolled the streets of the 
capital home to about 7 million people 
little violence was reported around the country on sunday 
despite threats by the shining path to disrupt the elections 
at least 10 bombs exploded sunday in huancayo a highland 
farming center 120 miles east of lima police said that one placed 
by guerrillas at a polling station killed one person and wounded 
eight 
in a separate attack rebels shot and killed three brothers 
police said a note was found on one of the bodies that said this 
is how informers die 
fujimori the son of japanese immigrants said sunday that he 
would seek improved relations with countries of the pacific basin 
i understand that in the land of my ancestors there is great 
interest in my election he said

four months ago alberto fujimori was a 
complete newcomer to politics 
those who did know the softspoken 51yearold agricultural 
engineer knew him as the former rector of the respected national 
agrarian university 
now this son of japanese immigrants has astounded peruvians 
with a meteoric rise from obscurity they call it fujimania 
fujimori sold his house car and tractor just to raise campaign 
funds 
he avoided specifics speaking mainly of broad social goals like 
improved health care and revitalized industry 
he sometimes resorted to attentiongetting gimmicks such as 
dressing like a samurai warrior for news photographers 
whatever the formula it worked 
fujimori claimed to be the only candidate truly independent of 
professional politicians but during the campaign he showed 
political skill honed during his years of running a university in a 
country where universities are highly politicized 
fujimori is the oldest of five children the son of a tailor 
from the southern japanese island of kyushu who came to peru in 
1934 to work its coastal cotton plantations 
his father worked at various jobs including an upholstery shop 
he opened in lima the family lost the business during a boycott of 
japanese businesses during world war ii 
in 1960 fujimori earned a degree in agricultural engineering 
from the national agrarian university where he later taught 
mathematics 
he served as the schools rector from 1984 to 1989 he did 
postgraduate work at the university of wisconsin and the 
university of strasburg in france 
fujimori got a peek at the circles of power by serving for two 
years as an agricultural adviser to the outgoing government of 
president alan garcia 
he speaks spanish japanese english french and german 
he describes himself as studious introverted and lacking all 
common vices he says work is his hobby that he devotes 12 to 
13 hours a day to it 
along with their four children fujimori and his wife susana 
higuchi had been running their own threeacre farm before the race 
in his brief time in the political spotlight fujimori has been 
surrounded by controversy critics say the agriculture university 
went into sharp decline under his leadership 
he has been charged with evading taxes on the sale of various 
properties and with illegally benefitting from a landdistribution 
program designed to aid peasants 
in addition his close connections with perus evangelical 
community prompted the countrys roman catholic church to take the 
unusual step of voicing support for the man he defeated celebrated 
novelist mario vargas llosa 
fujimori has been accused of having close ties to the ruling 
aprista party and critics claim he is a trojan horse through 
which garcia will retain power 
the large majority of perus 60000member japanese immigrant 
community supported vargas llosa 
but fujimori was overwhelmingly supported by millions of perus 
poor who account for more than 50 percent this country of 22 
million 
the poor needed an alternative to vargas llosa and the failed 
policies of the present government said jorge castillo of the 
private polling company datum fujimori is a candidate invented 
by the electorate 
fujimori has compared his campaign strategy to the martial arts 
you take advantage of the forces of the other boom boom 
wherever they lead he told the associated press in an interview 
during the campaign slicing his hand through an imaginary brick 
thus he attacked vargas llosas freemarket platform while 
remaining vague about many of his own ideas 
usually dressed in a threepiece suit fujimori appeared stiff 
and serious among potential voters but they warmed to him and his 
promises of discipline and hard work 
he says his political movement called simply change 90 is an 
expression of people who are tired of the old corrupt political 
parties and who just want to work

the supertanker burning in the gulf of mexico carried more than 
three times the oil spilled by the exxon valdez off alaska last 
year but authorities said that if the mega borg sank it might not 
cause as big a catastrophe 
two key differences the mega borgs cargo was light crude 
which disperses much more rapidly than the heavy crude carried by 
the exxon valdez and fire is consuming the mega borgs oil 
the exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
about onefifth of the 987foot ships cargo when it ran aground 
on bligh reef in prince william sound 25 miles from the port of 
valdez on march 24 1989 
it was the nations worst oil spill more than 1100 miles of 
alaska shoreline were soiled thousands of birds mammals and other 
wildlife were killed 
the mega borg was carrying 38 million gallons of light crude 
when it was wracked by explosions and fire on saturday about 57 
miles southeast of galveston texas at first little oil spilled 
but five powerful explosions sunday sent blazing crude pouring into 
the gulf 
the mega borg was listing and apparently in greater danger of 
sinking than the exxon valdez was the fire however appeared to 
be consuming much of its oil 
it causes some air pollution but that dissipates said 
coast guard chief petty officer todd nelson what would be worse 
would be for it to sit on the surface and drift toward shore 
even if that happened the light crude would disperse much more 
rapidly than heavy crude coast guard capt tom greene said 
a spill about one mile long north of the vessel and one about 20 
miles long to the south were visible sunday evening officials 
estimated the slicks contained 7000 gallons of oil 
currents and winds were expected to push the oil toward a 150to 
200mile stretch of texas coast between freeport and corpus 
christi but greene said inshore currents could keep the spill 
washing ashore 
if it reached shore however the spill could jeopardize a 
wildlife refuge salt marshes oyster reefs and other crucial 
habitat environmentalists said 
i hate the thought of it said brandt mannchen of the sierra 
club 
the entire galveston bay is extremely valuable for both 
recreational fishermen and commercial fishermen said alan allen 
executive director of the sportsmen conservationists of texas

live crew became martyrs for the first amendment when they were 
arrested on obscenity charges after a concert their lawyer says 
band leader luther luke skyywalker campbell and chris 
fresh kid ice wongwon were arrested by more than a dozen 
sheriffs detectives early sunday 
they were charged with singing lyrics from their 
platinumselling album which was ruled obscene by a federal judge 
in fort lauderdale 
if we had to do it again wed do it again wongwon said 
before the miami rappers took the stage in phoenix on sunday night 
we were arrested for playing to adults he said he added 
that broward county fla sheriff nick navarro has a racial bias 
against their music 
its a black company its a black group he said 
campbell 29 and wongwon 26 were freed without bail after two 
hours in jail the misdemeanor carries up to a year in jail and a 
1000 fine 
the other band members mark brother marquis ross and david 
mr mixx hobbs left hollywoods club futura in a separate car 
and were not stopped navarro said arrest warrants would be issued 
for them today 
they could have rapped anything up to and including white 
christmas said sheriffs spokesman al gordon as long as they 
didnt sing anything from as nasty as they wanna be they 
would not have been arrested 
the rappers attorney bruce rogow said the judges ruling 
fridays arrest of a fort lauderdale record store owner who sold 
the album to undercover agents and the arrests of band members 
show navarro and other antiobscenity crusaders are out of 
control 
now everybodys rallying around the first amendment and 
incidentally around 2 live crew rogow said its made them 
martyrs for the first amendment 
the arrests gave 2 live crew publicity it would not otherwise 
have received he said

criminals must have a had a field day this is nothing more than 
talking dirty

the band refused to go along with a similar request at their 
adultsonly concert sunday in hollywood where they screamed 
profanities along with a wildly gyrating audience of about 400 
undercover detectives documented the bands performance which 
included repeated insults against navarro 
we didnt want to create any commotion in there so i told 
them to let them get out of there and arrest them away from the 
premises said navarro 
deputies pulled over campbell and wongwons car several blocks 
from the club 
rogow said he believes us district judge jose gonzalezs 
ruling wednesday did not make it illegal to sing the songs in a 
setting like club futura

worlds oldest man has died in his sleep at age 112 his 
daughterinlaw says

beside his bed at his cottage in forestfach near swansea wales 
after feeling a little unwell for a few days

authenticated is a 115yearold woman carrie c white born in 
gadsden fla on nov 18 1874 she lives in a nursing home in 
palatka fla 
evans was born on aug 19 1877 when queen victoria was on the 
british throne he started working in coal mines when he was 13 
and only stopped at age 73 because of national coal board mandatory 
retirement rules 
evans was fitted with a pacemaker when he was 108 doctors at 
cardiff hospital said at the time they thought he was the oldest 
person to undergo the operation and were astounded when he was able 
to return home three days later 
its given me a new lease of life and i dont have to go 
back to have new batteries put in for another 10 years he joked 
at the time 
evans had a wheelchair but preferred a walking stick he worked 
in his garden until he was 95 planting potatoes and other 
vegetables 
like many welshmen he loved to sing 
ive been doing that since i was a little boy going to sunday 
school id sing plenty of it he said in the bbc interview 
in 1987 evans visited london 190 miles away to celebrate his 
110th birthday he said he thought of making the trip in 1900 but 
couldnt afford the 250 it cost then for the train ticket 
evans 79yearold son amwel had his own explanation for his 
fathers long life 
my father always had a very lively mind and just loved life 
he said sunday im sure that had everything to do with his 
remarkable health were all very sad but very proud of him 
today 
mrs evans amwels wife said a big gap has been left in our 
lives the longer john was with us the harder it was going to be 
to say goodbye 
evans lived with amwel and betty 
he is survived by two other sons and a daughter six 
grandchildren and nine greatgrandchildren funeral plans have not 
been announced 
norris mcwhirter founding editor of the guinness book of 
records said sunday that it is not yet known who succeeds evans as 
the oldest man

pushing down share prices across the board on the tokyo stock 
exchange 
the dollar closed at 15410 yen up 145 yen from fridays close 
of 15265 yen it opened at the days low of 15335 yen and rose as 
high as 15420 yen 
its close was the highest since 15415 yen on may 11 
traders attributed the dollars rise to its gain on overseas 
markets at the end of last week and concern about the governing 
liberal democratic partys loss of an upper house byelection on

soviet union and uncertainties about the impact of german 
unification they added 
on the stock market the 225share nikkei stock average fell 
45311 points or 137 percent closing at 3254018 
dealers said the yens weakness against the dollar and the 
governing partys defeat in sundays byelection discouraged 
investors 
negative factors pulled down bond prices and nikkei index 
futures leading to a sharp deline in share prices as well said 
a dealer with nikko securities co speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
a trader with nomura securities co said fridays 3495point 
decline in the dow jones industrial average in new york further 
discouraged market players

the board large capital shares such as heavy industry and steel 
issues were particularly weak 
the governing partys defeat in the byelection triggered 
concern in the market that it has not fully recovered from the 
distrust caused by recent money and sex scandals and the 
introduction of an unpopular tax 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bond fell to 8718 points at 5 pm from

a 90foot tear discovered on the bottom 
of a cruise ship threatened a spill of 110000 gallons of diesel 
fuel today off cape cod the coast guard said 
the ship ran onto rocks in heavy fog and began taking on water 
sunday but the more than 1060 passengers and crew members were 
evacuated and damage was at first believed confined to small tears 
that spilled up to 1500 gallons of fuel 
however divers late sunday discovered a 2footwide tear that 
exposed four of the bermuda stars fuel tanks containing 110000 
gallons of diesel said coast guard spokesman steve aitkins 
the potential exists for a medium to high probability of a 
major oil spill the coast guard said in a statement 
cleanup workers manned booms around the 617foot ship to corral 
the fuel and used absorbent material to soak up the spill 
aitkins said that pressure from sea water was keeping most of 
the diesel in its tanks but that the fuel would have to be unloaded 
before the vessel could be moved for repairs 
the coast guard hoped to inspect the vessel at daybreak and use 
pumps on board to transfer the fuel into the ships undamaged tanks 
or into other vessels aitkins said 
earlier he said the coast guard would charge bermuda star 
cruise line the ships owner with federal pollution charges 
the captain hans lewing and other crew members were given 
blood and alcohol tests which are routine after accidents results 
were expected today 
the vessel on a cruise from new york to nova scotia went 
aground about five miles off woods hole while passengers were 
having breakfast tugboats freed it 13 hours later the passengers 
and some of the crew were ferried to shore 
flooding through the holes in the hull was under control by 
midday 
passenger robert lewis wichita falls texas said no one on 
board panicked it was kind of like we bumped into something 
he said there was a loud grinding noise but no one seemed to be 
scared 
scot graham a coast guard marine safety officer in providence 
ri said the ship was three hours ahead of schedule and 
offcourse when it ran aground fog had cut visibility to about a 
quartermile officials said

using too much water to douse the 
fire aboard the mega borg could sink the oil supertanker but 
firefighters using foam to smother the flames today faced another 
problem salvage experts say 
you have to get on that ship to extinguish it said les 
williams whose port arthur texas salvage company has fought 
nearly two dozen offshore oil fires if the fires below deck 
its like trying to walk on a hot skillet you cant do that 
the fire burned since saturday aboard the 853foot norwegian 
ship crippled in the gulf of mexico 57 miles southeast of 
galveston it started with an explosion in the engine room on 
saturday five blasts sunday sent blazing crude oil from the 
tankers 38milliongallon cargo into the sea 
thats a very hard fire to fight there in the engine room 
like that rudy teichmann of tampt marine salvage inc in galveston 
said its all closed up and you cant get to it 
they cant flood that engine room with water that could sink 
the ship its a lot different than fighting a forest fire said 
teichmann 
the mega borg already was listing its stern dropped 58 feet 
since the first explosion indicating either the cargo had shifted 
or the ship was taking on water the coast guard said the aft deck 
was reported just 5 feet above the water today 
about 30000 gallons of foam has been shipped to the scene the 
coast guard said but using it entails firefighting at close range 
wiliams said the usual procedure is for two or three 
firefighters wearing fireretardant jumpsuits that are light 
enough to swim in to board the tanker 
carrying a 3inch diameter hose leading to foam pumps aboard a 
nearby boat they target the fires point of origin he said the 
hose or wand can shoot 5000 gallons of foam per minute 
attempting the job is smit american salvage inc the us 
division of a rotterdam company smit has helped fight more than 
100 tanker and oil rig fires including blazes in the persian gulf 
during the iraniraq war company officials said 
steve davis captain of the 180foot supply boat tradewind and 
his crew of four spent sunday loading drums of chemical foam on 
board the boat to fight the mega borg fire 
i would hate to see oil all over these beaches davis said 
as specialists from the netherlands finished bolting highpowered 
pumps and nozzle connections to the ships deck 
davis boat is one of six from pelican island near galveston 
that were hired to fight the fire 
god willing and weather permitting thats the saying in 
salvage said rick chianelli salvage foreman for smit american

the renamed communists held a commanding 
lead today in bulgarias first free elections in 58 years bucking 
the anticommunist trend in countries that emerged from the soviet 
orbit in the past year 
the party and once moscows most loyal follower appeared 
likely to become the only ruling party in eastern europe to retain 
power in multiparty elections according to projections from 
independent polling organizations 
however opposition leaders charged that sundays parliamentary 
vote had been marred by irregularities and more than 2000 
protesters demonstrated outside parliament today shouting 
fraud and calling for a general strike 
police cordoned off the building and the crowd appeared to be 
growing the opposition scheduled a mass evening rally for downtown 
sofia 
independent projections gave the socialists heirs to the 
longruling communists about 48 percent of the vote in sundays 
parliamentary vote the main opposition coalition the union of 
democratic forces had just under 35 percent official results were 
expected later today 
there were complaints from opposition officials that the 
ballotcounting was moving very slowly but union chairman zhelyu 
zhelev told reporters that he did not believe the opposition would 
challenge the elections validity 
in the worst case we shall want new elections in districts 
where there have been real flagrant violations he said 
the west german polling organization infas said the opposition 
won the capital of sofia where it was expected to receive about 55 
percent of the vote against 38 percent for the socialists who 
called themselves communist until april 
however the union lagged behind in the countryside where 
analysts had expected the opposition to have a tough time for many 
people outside sofia radical change is feared and the socialists 
represent stability 
the socialists favor introducing economic reforms gradually 
avoiding the shock therapy that has caused steep price rises 
and widespread unemployment in poland 
the 16party union of democratic forces favors a swift move to a 
market economy and restoring private ownership its supporters say 
it offers the best guarantee of democratic change 
the socialists have said they want to govern in a coalition with 
the opposition in order to get a broadbased consensus for tackling 
the countrys economic problems union leaders have ruled out such 
a coalition 
at least 84 percent of the countrys 64 million eligible voters 
cast ballots for the 400seat grand national assembly the central 
election commission said late sunday 
in all 3143 candidates from 38 parties ran for election to the 
parliament half of the seats will be awarded on the basis of 
proportional representation the others allocated according to 
results in 200 districts races runoffs are to be held sunday where 
no candidate wins a majority 
bulgaria is the fifth eastern european country to hold free 
parliamentary elections this year the communists suffered 
resounding defeats in east germany hungary and czechoslovakia in 
romaia the national salvation front a coalition dominated by 
former communists that took power after the overthrow and execution 
of dictator nicolae ceausescu won multiparty elections 
in bulgaria reform communists engineered the nations drive to 
democracy removing longtime hardline communist leader todor 
zhivkov in november 
president petar mladenov has won public support for initiating 
reforms that included a renunciation of the partys monopoly on 
power 
the bulgarian communist party also has deep roots in the 
country the party was founded in 1891 predating the soviet 
communist party 
it captured 20 percent of the vote in 1932 the countrys last 
free elections and has ruled bulgaria since 1944 
opposition leaders charged that a socialist victory would stem 
from the continuing strong influence through patronage of the 
communist nomenklatura or apparatus 
but political observers said the union lost potential supporters 
because of poor leadership 
the association for free and fair elections a bulgarian 
monitoring group said its vote projections gave the socialists 
483 percent of the vote against 349 percent for the union and 83 
percent for the agrarian party formerly a docile ally of the 
communists infas had similar projections 
the only other party projected to win seats was the movement for 
rights and freedoms which was receiving about 80 percent of the 
vote in areas heavily populated by the 15 million ethnic turkish 
minority bta reported 
the projections gave the ethnic turkish group from 57 to 84 
percent of the vote nationwide 
thousands of bulgarian and foreign observers monitored the 
voting there were only scattered reports of irregularities 
including allegations of stolen ballot papers and lastminute 
campaigning banned under election law 
opposition campaign manager petko simeonov told a news 
conference today that the union believed the elections to have been 
fair in most places however he said he gave election officials a 
list of 211 cases of alleged violations 
simeonov said conditions for free elections had been secured in 
most places but there has been strong moral pressure on the 
electorate especially in small villages 
he claimed that after the voting signals of different 
violations of election procedure came like a tidal wave 
beforehand actor and opposition activist yosif serchadzhiev 
alleging electoral fraud in the village of pazardzhik during an 
appearance on live national televison burst into tears and ran off 
camera 
heated onair exchanges and shouting followed 
the main task of the new parliament will be to write a new 
consititution to usher in democratic and economic reforms the 
parliament must also deal with a 10 billion foreign debt growing 
inflation and shortages of basic consumer items including sugar and 
cheese

less than a mile away from the original site that they say is 
easier to defend 
in a brief ribboncutting ceremony today us ambassador donald 
p gregg said the united states had erred by remaining silent for 
nine years about the kwangju uprising he reiterated that 
washington was not involved in the suppression of the uprising 
last year the us government officially clarified its position 
on kwangju to a special committee of the south korean national 
assembly but radicals called it a coverup 
when gregg visited kwangju in january he was the first us 
ambassador known to have been in the city since the uprising 
during that visit i came to realize that american silence had 
contributed to a hardening of suspicions and mistrust on the part 
of some of the people of this city toward the united states 
gregg said in remarks prepared for delivery at the ceremony 
police in kwangju were placed on alert for greggs visit after 
radical student leaders said they had formed death squads to 
kidnap the us ambassador and block the reopening of the center 
about 1000 riot police guarded the center during the ceremony 
which was attended by the citys mayor and other korean officials 
but radicals did not disrupt the opening us officials in seoul 
said 
before the ceremony gregg told korean reporters that those 
who oppose the reopening of the cultural center are a minority 
gregg said he was aware of the threats against him but added 
that they would not prevent the center from opening to the public 
gregg a former cia station chief in seoul and aide to thenvice 
president bush during the irancontra affair has been a target of 
radicals since he was named ambassador last year 
in october six students wielding iron pipes and homemade 
explosives attacked his residence in seoul gregg and his wife were 
inside but escaped harm 
elsewhere today the seoul appellate court reduced the sentences 
of a radical female student and a roman catholic priest who had 
been convicted of illegally visiting communist north korea 
presiding judge song chaehon cited the changing political 
climate on the korean peninsula including the easing of 
restrictions on contact with north korea as grounds for reducing 
the sentences 
the court cut the prison sentence for im sukyong a 22yearold 
student from 10 to five years and reduced the prison term for the 
rev moon gyuhyon 41 from eight to five years 
ms im gained national attention when she defied the government 
by attending an international youth festival in the north korean 
capital of pyongyang last july the priest went to north korea to 
accompany her home and both were arrested on their return in 
august

thailands former army chief gen 
chavalit yongchaiyudh resigned as defense minister and deputy 
prime minister today just as the prime minister was to leave to 
visit the united states 
chavalit regarded by some as a future prime minister took up 
the two posts less than three months ago after retiring as head of 
the armed forces a resignation letter delivered to prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan today came after a weeklong series of attacks 
by political opponents 
chavalit had complained of corruption within the government and 
also was resented by those who opposed the army officers presence 
in the cabinet 
present circumstances do not allow me to carry on serving my 
country in the spirit i had intended chavalits resignation 
letter said 
the announcement came just hours before chatichai was to leave 
for a weeklong visit to the united states where he was to meet 
with president bush 
chatichai had no plans to call off the visit government 
officials said 
a senior military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said chatichai had done nothing to prevent the attacks on chavalit 
which were given prominence in local press reports 
on thursday the bangkok post carried a frontpage report that 
chalerm yubamrung a minister in the prime ministers office had 
compared chavalits wife to a walking jewelry case 
it apparently was a response to charges by chavalit of 
corruption within the government while army chief chavalit said 
corrupt officials should have their heads chopped off 
chalerm was quoted as saying that people should examine their 
own backgrounds before making such comments 
corruption within the chatichai government has been a major 
target of opposition political parties which were expected to 
attempt a formal censure of the government when the prime minister 
returns from the united states 
the attacks came as chavalit was in tokyo acting as a mediator 
at a failed round of cambodian peace talks 
basically the past week gen chavalit has been serving the 
government by spending sleepless nights in tokyo trying for some 
progress on cambodia the army officer said 
in the meantime at home so many hands were stabbing him in the 
back he said 
chavalits entry into the cabinet in late march stirred 
controversy as he was not an elected member of parliament students 
and opposition groups called it a setback for democracy and accused 
the former army chief of jumping the queue to political power

the federal government rarely names public 
buildings after living people but its making an exception for 
92yearold judge elbert parr tuttle one of the souths leading 
civil rights advocates 
the home of the 11th us circuit court of appeals was to be 
renamed the elbert parr tuttle us court of appeals building today 
after its oldest living judge 
last christmas an 11th circuit judge was killed by a mail bomb 
and a similar bomb was safely intercepted at the courthouse 
another bomb killed a savannah lawyer and one was sent to the naacp 
office in jacksonville fla 
but the ceremony for tuttle was expected to recall an earlier 
era when the court was the target of death threats and political 
pressure because of landmark civil rights rulings 
tuttle was appointed by president eisenhower in 1954 three 
months after the supreme courts brown vs board of education 
ruling struck down school desegregation 
he became a leader of the old 5th us circuit court of appeals 
now the 11th when it served as the legal battleground for the 
civil rights movement 
as chief judge from 1961 to 1967 tuttle helped decide landmark 
cases involving jim crow laws voting rights jury discrimination 
employment discrimination reapportionment and school 
desegregation including the order to admit james meredith to the 
university of mississippi 
in a dissenting opinion later adopted by the us supreme 
court he argued in 1966 that georgias house of representatives 
could not refuse to seat julian bond for opposing the vietnam war 
tuttle took senior or semiretired status in 1968 
raised in california and hawaii tuttle came to atlanta in 1923 
and with his brotherinlaw founded a law firm that took on 
controversial cases 
it battled to win a new trial for a black man convicted of 
raping a white woman and challenged a georgia law under which a 
black communist was sentenced to 20 years on a chain gang for 
distributing communist party literature 
he became a state republican leader in the 1940s after becoming 
appalled at the whitesonly policies of georgias democratic party

a skydiver who jumped from the 54th floor of 
a skyscraper under construction died when his parachute didnt 
open and a friend who leaped with him and landed safely could face 
charges police said 
robert morris jr 25 was pronounced dead early sunday where he 
landed rod stoltzfus 27 landed safely in a parking lot across 
the street 
the pair jumped off the mellon bank building at 550 am police 
lt giacomo giovinetti said the two broke locks on the chainlink 
fence surrounding the construction site to get into the building 
stoltzfus called his pastor and went with him to see morriss 
family before contacting police according to detective james 
mooney 
stoltzfus could be charged with risking a catastrophe causing a 
disturbance and disorderly conduct police said but after 
interviewing him for four hours sunday night police said they 
wanted to review the case before deciding whether to file charges 
its an irresponsible act but its not so cut and dried 
giovinetti said 
someone obviously lost a loved one he said i dont think 
we should be insensitive about this they could have injured people 
on the ground too 
morris fathers worst fears were realized robert morris sr a 
skydiver with 2000 jumps to his credit said he worried about his 
only sons passion for jumping from buildings and bridges and hoped 
he would tire of it 
he liked the thrill of it the elder morris said i just 
hope and pray no one ever does it again 
it was the second time in less than a year that jumpers have 
parachuted off the building 
a man identified as a new york waiter jumped off the 47th floor 
of the same skyscraper last aug 26 three skydivers jumped off 
another skyscraper in 1986 while it was under construction none 
was arrested 
most skydivers frown on such antics said al gramando owner of 
the diving school skydive chambersburg 
they bring a bad name on the parachuting world and we really 
dont have much sympathy he said

the two political groups that 
broke the grip of communist rule on czechoslovakia today began the 
search for coalition partners after winning the countrys first 
free elections in 44 years 
a spokesman for president vaclav havel said the leader plans to 
appoint a new premier within days and probably will give the job to 
the incumbent marian calfa a former communist who turned in his 
party card in january 
it is probable calfa will be entrusted with the role of 
forming a new government presidential spokesman michael 
zantovsky told a news conference today 
official results showed that havels civic forum and the group 
public against violence the czech and slovak sister organizations 
that spearheaded the november prodemocracy revolt had captured 
the most seats in a new federal parliament calfa was a top 
candidate of public against violence 
the communists who were overthrown in the november uprising 
finished suprisingly strong capturing second ahead of the 
christian democrats 
turnout among the 112 million eligible voters was 967 percent 
the highest percentage in eastern europes recent spate of free 
elections 
civic forum and its sister party won 169 of the 300 contested 
seats in parliament but fell short of the threefifths needed to 
enact key constitutional and economic reforms that would fulfill 
the goals of the revolution the two political groups captured 
about 46 percent of the vote 
civic forum had said before the voting on friday and saturday 
that it would seek a coalition government 
we can say that the longing for freedom democracy and a 
different order prevailed in this election havel told state 
television just after the results were announced sunday 
the communists won just under 14 percent of the vote and 48 
seats the christian democrats finished third with less than 12 
percent and 40 seats 
both civic forum and the christian democrats have ruled out a 
coalition with the communists 
three parties representing separatist regional interests were 
the only other groups to clear the 5 percent minimum vote required 
in either the czech or slovak republic to get seats the seat 
totals for all the parties may change slightly under the complex 
system of allocating votes 
civic forum and public against violence were likely to seek a 
coalition with the threeparty christian democratic alliance 
despite campaign acrimony generated by charges that josef 
bartoncik a christian democratic leader had been an informer for 
the hated communist secret police 
havel a former dissident playwright who was a reluctant 
candidate for office before the revolution now seems virtually 
certain to be elected for a twoyear term by the new parliament 
which has 40 days to decide 
international observer groups expressed satisfaction about the 
fairness of the balloting

president bush extends the first white house 
welcome ever to a leader of east germany today in a meeting he says 
dramatizes the magnificent changes sweeping europe 
prime minister lothar de maiziere who came to office after free 
elections in march what was once a hardline communist state heads 
a government that is expected to make way soon for a single germany 
uniting east and west 
bush said sunday he was eager to talk with de maiziere about 
his vision as to the postwar europe postgerman unification 
europe 
the president planned to receive his visitor from the german 
democratic republic in the oval office hold expanded talks in the 
cabinet room and then have lunch with de maiziere in the white 
house family quarters 
de maiziere is not only the first leader of east germany to 
visit the white house he is almost certainly the last 
the two germanys are moving ahead next month with monetary union 
on a footing that will provide massive subsidies from prosperous 
west germany for the financially strapped east 
the date has not yet been set but a pangermanic election could 
be held as early as next january to make the country whole again 
ending the division imposed by the four allies who defeated nazi 
germany in world war ii 
bush after dining friday night with visiting west german 
chancellor helmut kohl called de maizieres visit just one more 
step that demonstrates the magnificent changes that have taken 
place over the past year and a half 
the wests insistence that a united germany be a full member of 
the north atlantic treaty organization remains a sticking point in 
ussoviet relations 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev insists that is 
unacceptable for soviet security he wants germany to keep a foot 
in both nato and the warsaw pact 
bush said friday night that he would keep trying to convince the 
soviets that a united germany in nato will not be threatening to 
the soviet union 
de maiziere 50 is chairman of the east german christian 
democratic union he was responsible for church affairs in the 
government of hans modrow the last communist leader 
de maiziere arrived in new york on saturday and met with roman 
catholic cardinal john oconnor on sunday he met with bankers in 
new york as well as members of the world jewish congress 
in a speech de maiziere said he understands jewish concerns 
about a unified germany 
nevertheless i wish to emphasize no one needs to have 
misgivings or even fears of a united germany he said germany 
today is totally different from germany between 1933 and 1945 
in addition to meeting today with bush and secretary of state 
james a baker iii de maiziere planned to lay a wreath at the tomb 
of the unknown soldier in arlington national cemetery meet the 
president of the us holocaust memorial council and deliver a 
lecture tonight at georgetown universitys foreign service school 
on tuesday he will meet with senators and members of the house 
and speak at the national press club before returning to new york 
for a meeting with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
he will leave for berlin that evening 
one of the first acts of east germanys newly democratic 
parliament this spring was to concede a share of the blame for the 
holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed by the nazis its 
former communist rulers had refused to pay any claims 
de maiziere subsequently wrote the president of the world jewish 
congress edgar bronfman saying he hoped for a settlement of the 
jewish claims within the framework of our possibilities 
west germany has paid more than 40 billion in reparations to 
israel under a 1952 agreement with the conference on jewish 
material claims

prime minister yitzhak shamirs new rightwing 
governing coalition faced a parliament vote of approval today that 
could end three months of political uncertainty 
before the vote shamir met with leaders of his likud bloc to 
map out strategy for warding off threats of last minute defections 
by three disgruntled legislators 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip the plobacked 
leaders of the 2yearold palestinian uprising against israeli 
rule called the new coalition a terrorist government and urged 
an escalation of the revolt 
likuds 2yearold governing coalition with the centerleft 
labor party led by shimon peres fell in a parliament vote of 
confidence march 15 the collapse came after likud refused labor 
demands that israel accept a us proposal for opening peace talks 
with palestinians 
israeli newspapers reported that shamir appeared likely to 
override defection threats and pull through with a majority of 62 
in the 120member legislature which must approve a government 
before it takes power 
as i see the situation now there is no problem said arab 
affairs minister ehud olmert of likud the chief negotiator in 
bringing together the coalition 
likud signed the agreement with 9 parties and splinter factions 
on friday 
one threat of defection came from shas a key fivemember 
ultraorthodox faction that demanded police cancel an investigation 
announced sunday into suspicions of fraud against its leader 
interior minister aryeh deri 
three other legislators inside likud also suggested they would 
abstain from the vote after failing to win cabinet appointments a 
fourth legislator indicated sunday he also might abstain but later 
changed his position 
israeli newspapers said that if shamir is not assured of 
victory the party would bow out of a vote today and call for early 
national elections now scheduled for 1992 
in april a coalition put together by peres fell apart several 
hours before parliament was to vote 
a victory for the rightwing coalition in parliament would be 
the fourth time that the polishborn shamir 74 would be sworn in 
as premier the first was in september 1983 when he took over from 
menachem begin who stepped down 
the new government is slated to have 19 ministers and at least 
six deputy ministers in a coalition comprised of 10 parties and 
splinter factions 
its policy guidelines call for taking tougher measures to crush 
the palestinian uprising in the occupied lands and beef up the army 
against war threats from iraq 
they also call for peace efforts with neighboring arab 
countries but at the same time urge more jewish settlement 
building in the west bank and gaza 
the guidelines declare that arabs in annexed east jerusalem can 
not take part in proposed elections for 17 million palestinians in 
the territories 
also included are controversial promises to ultraorthodox 
partners among them restrictions on publicfunded abortions 
banning the sale of pork and forcing more businesses to shut on the 
jewish sabbath 
among the coalitions supporters is a radical twomember faction 
that calls for expelling palestinians from disputed lands as a 
solution to the arabisraeli conflict 
peres said on israel television that the new cabinet would be 
the most radical government in israels history 
this narrow extremist government will not allow for any 
process of peace he said warning the new cabinet would likely 
run a collision course with the united states over peace moves 
in a leaflet entitled a call of defiance against the racist 
government uprising leaders in the west bank and gaza urged 
attacks on both the army and jewish settlers

the ruling party won all but 34 of more 
than 3700 seats in municipal councils in nationwide elections 
boycotted by opposition parties the government said today

crippled mega borg 
then powerful explosions sent flaming debris rocketing into the 
sky like roman candles the blast sent the sea ablaze with burning 
crude 
the tankers rear deck dropped to just 5 feet above surface 58 
feet lower than when the first explosion and fire crippled the ship 
early saturday in the gulf of mexico the ship apparently at 
anchor listed slightly 
the rear onefifth of the ship was engulfed in flames the 
fires intensity had buckled the castlelike structures steel walls 
and partially collapsed the ships stack 
on the waters surface pools of brown oil burned

mayor marion barry is expected to announce he 
will not seek reelection in an effort to reopen pleabargain talks 
with prosecutors trying him on cocaine and perjury charges sources 
close to barry say 
he knows that his reelection plans represent one of his best 
bargaining chips one source familiar with barrys thinking said 
sunday this is a move he hopes will break the logjam around the 
plea talks 
the timing of the expected announcement was uncertain but it 
could come as early as today 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug 
use 
barry met with top campaign officials and fundraisers late 
sunday to discuss his political situation but details of the 
private session were not available immediately 
one source had said going into the session that it was expected 
the mayor will tell us that were out of work 
amid the maneuvering jury selection in us district court 
entered its second week today some 90 of 250 potential jurors were 
screened last week but efforts were being made to speed the 
process so that a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates could be 
seated by next monday 
the jurors questioned this morning included a man who said an 
impression of sleaze has rubbed off on everyone in connection 
with the barry case 
the man said he thought barry had associated with unsavory 
characters 
the plea discussions which started more than two weeks ago 
broke down last week with us attorney jay b stephens insisting 
that barry plead guilty to a felony charge and the mayor only 
willing to consider a misdemeanor plea 
a guilty plea to any of the perjury charges probably would 
result in barry drawing a prison term under federal sentencing 
guidelines in that event he could not continue to hold office or 
run for reelection to a fourth fouryear term 
by taking himself out of the mayors race barry hopes to 
persuade stephens to relax his demands for a felony plea said the 
sources all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity 
right now he feels this is the best he can get one source 
said it guarantees him nothing but there is a hope that if he 
isnt running again stephens might reconsider his stance 
the sources said barry has agonized over the decision to abandon 
hopes of retaining the job he has held since 1979 
anything is possible one source said hes getting a lot 
of pressure from his supporters not to do this and right now hes 
waking up every morning and deciding what he wants to do 
sometimes it is different from one day to the next 
efforts to reach barry and his spokeswoman lurma rackley by 
telephone sunday were unsuccessful 
barry had been set to announce last friday that he is bowing out 
of contention for the mayors chair sources said but instead said 
through rackley that he had made no decision about his political 
future 
several sources said the mayor postponed his announcement 
because he was angry that congressional del walter fauntroy now a 
mayoral candidate said he was playing an active role in contacting 
members of congress to encourage the white house to put pressure on 
stephens to seek a plea agreement 
fauntroy later played down those discussions and an 
unidentified member of the congressional black caucus told the new 
york times that fauntroy had done none of the mediating that he had 
claimed 
civil rights leader jesse jackson who has met several times 
with barry has said publicly that he urged the mayor to end his 
campaign and seek a plea bargain to spare the city the pain of a 
drawnout trial 
barrys top political aide anita bonds told the washington 
post that the mayors supporters were furious with fauntroy for 
injecting himself into the case and that some backers are mad at 
jesse too

the supreme court refused today to limit the 
power of a federal judges appointees to supervise elections and 
other activities of the teamsters union 
the justices without comment rejected arguments that lower 
courts were unlawfully enforcing orders aimed at ridding the union 
of corruption and ties to organized crime 
the case stems from the federal governments 1988 lawsuit 
accusing the teamsters of violating the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act 
the union agreed on the eve of a trial to settle the suit under 
a consent decree approved by us district judge david edelstein in 
new york city 
the judge appointed three officials to discipline corrupt union 
leaders to help run the union and to supervise its future 
elections 
the union then challenged the power of one appointee to monitor 
local balloting leading up to next years election of international 
teamsters officers 
the teamsters also said edelstein violated members freespeech 
rights by ordering the union to distribute monthly reports issued 
by the courtappointed administrator 
the judge said the union could comply either by continuing 
monthly publication of its magazine the international teamster or 
by mailing the administrators report separately 
the order was prompted by the unions decision to scale back the 
magazine publishing it quarterly rather than monthly 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals without holding a 
hearing rejected the unions appeal of edelsteins orders 
in the appeal acted on today union lawyers said the appeals 
court illegally refused to review edelsteins orders 
the case is teamsters vs us 891602

the supreme court today let stand the 
mailfraud and taxevasion convictions of fringe presidential 
candidate lyndon h larouche jr and six associates 
the court without comment turned away arguments that the seven 
were denied a fair trial 
larouche is serving a 15year prison sentence in rochester minn 
he and the others were convicted in federal court in alexandria 
va in late 1988 of participating in a criminal conspiracy 
involving more than 30 million in defaulted loans 
prosecutors said fundraisers for larouche organizations based 
in leesburg va took loans from potential contributors even 
though larouche had no intention of repaying the lenders the 
prosecutors also said he avoided taxes by reporting no income and 
having his living expenses paid through corporations he controlled 
also convicted were william wertz edward spannaus michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein 
wertz and spannaus each was sentenced to five years in prison and 
fined 1000 the other four defendants were sentenced to three 
years and ordered to pay fines 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for larouche and the 
others argued that the defendants were denied adequate time to 
prepare for trial and that the trials jury selection was 
conducted unfairly 
the appeal also contended that the trial judge wrongly curtailed 
the defendants right to present their case 
the trial courts consistent desire to elevate speed and 
docket control over the rights of criminal defendants meant it 
equated critical defense evidence with mere diversions whenever 
such evidence threatened to slow down the rapid pace of trial 
the appeal said 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals rejected those arguments 
and upheld the seven convictions last jan 22 
the case is larouche vs us 891785

the supreme court today struck down a new 
federal law that outlaws burning the american flag punishing 
desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this 
emblem so revered the court said 
in other rulings the court gave police broad new authority to 
stop and question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip and 
ruled that the federal government may order state national guard 
troops to participate in peacetime training abroad without a 
governors consent 
the courts 54 decision in the flag case indicated the 
divisiveness of the emotional issue the ruling is certain to touch 
off a political battle in congress to pass a constitutional 
amendment protecting the flag from desecration 
in a split identical to a ruling last year on the flagburning 
issue the justices said the flag protection act of 1989 violates 
freedom of expression guaranteed by the first amendment to the 
constitution writing for the majority justice william j brennan 
called it a bedrock constitutional guarantee 
president bush said he would intensify his efforts to win 
approval of a constitutional amendment banning flagburning some 
of us said ahead of time that the legislative approach would not be 
upheld apparently the court decided that he said 
speaking to reporters after a rose garden ceremony honoring 
drugfree schools bush said that he would continue to press for 
what i strongly believe is in the public interest 
congressional leaders had said if the law were declared invalid 
they would move quickly for votes in the house and senate on a 
constitutional amendment to protect old glory from burning or 
desecration 
that move is expected to inject the issue into this falls 
congressional and state legislative campaigns 
a constitutional amendment would require approval by twothirds 
of the members of the house and senate and then ratification by 38 
state legislatures the first amendment never has been altered in 
199 years 
we are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive 
to many brennan wrote 
but quoting from the courts earlier ruling he said if 
there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it is 
that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea 
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or 
disagreeable 
brennan noted that the government has said there is a national 
consensus in favor of banning flag burning even assuming such a 
consensus exists any suggestion that the governments interest in 
suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to 
that speech grows is foreign to the first amendment he said 
justice john paul stevens in a dissenting opinion said the 
government has a legitimate interest in banning flag burning 
the flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty equality 
and tolerance ideas that americans have passionately defended and 
debated throughout our history he said the flag embodies the 
spirit of our national commitment to those ideals 
in the 1989 case the court struck down a texas law banning flag 
burning it was that yearold opinion that prompted congress to 
approve the federal law declared unconstitutional today 
supporters of the federal legislation said it is different from 
the texas law because the federal act does not single out flag 
burning as a means of expression 
the federal law forbids defiling or destruction of the flag for 
any purpose except to destroy a soiled or worn flag 
david cole an attorney with the center for constitutional 
rights and cocounsel for defendants in the case said we are 
overjoyed the court has essentially said that the first amendment 
means what it says and that is that the government cannot 
incarcerate its citizens for engaging in political expression that 
the government doesnt like 
the bush administration with some reluctance joined in 
defending the federal law 
president bush and leading republicans said they would prefer a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning and bush allowed the 
legislation to become law without his signature 
i remain convinced that a constitutional amendment is the 
only way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration 
bush said then 
in the 63 police ruling the justices said anonymous tips can 
justify stopping and questioning someone if the information is in 
some way corroborated before such action is taken 
in the national guard case that revived a controversy from the 
1988 presidential campaign the justices unanimously upheld a 1986 
federal law challenged by gov rudy perpich of minnesota 
the law was challenged previously by gov michael dukakis of 
massachusetts the defeated 1988 democratic presidential candidate 
who opposed sending national guard troops to train in central 
america 
in other action today the court 
refused to let a private jewish group display a menorah in a 
public park near the burlington vt city hall 
the justices without comment let stand a rulilng that barred 
city officials last december from granting permission for the 
menorahs display 
agreed to hear a bush administration appeal aimed at heading 
off all lawsuits against government employees accused of causing 
personal injury 
the court said it will consider killing a texas familys medical 
malpractice suit against an army doctor 
agreed to review a dispute over the power of federal 
prosecutors to force distributors of adult books and films to turn 
over such material and business records to the government 
the court said it will review a ruling that a new york city 
company must turn over business records but not193 videotapes 
to a prosecutor in virginia 
the prime sponsors of the flagburning law were democrats who 
learned a bitter lesson from the 1988 presidential campaign in 
which bush exploited patriotic values in defeating gov michael 
dukakis of massachusetts 
the law made it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison for 
anyone who burns mutilates defaces tramples the flag or 
maintains it on the floor or ground 
the latter phrase was prompted by a controversial chicago art 
exhibit last year in which viewers were invited to stand on an 
american flag and write comments about the display in a ledger 
todays cases reached the court after federal judges in the 
district of columbia and seattle said the federal law violates 
first amendment rights the law was challenged by demonstrators who 
burned american flags in the two cities 
brennan read for six minutes from his opinion in the hushed and 
crowded courtroom 
brennan was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
stevens was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist byron 
r white and sandra day oconnor 
the cases are us vs eichman 891433 and us vs haggerty

more than 11000 contra fighters met 
last weekends demobilization deadline and the remaining 3000 are 
expected to do so within a few days un sources said today 
the demobilization process began may 7 and was to have been 
completed by sunday but it was interrupted twice by the contras 
once by concern over the stability of the government of president 
violeta barrios de chamorro and once over a false report of a 
massacre of unarmed contras 
mrs chamorros government took over in april following a decade 
of rule by the leftist sandinistas whom the usbacked contras 
had sought to topple 
fernando castenon of the united nations managua office said as 
of sunday night 11228 contras had turned in their weapons 
the government agreed to create more than 20 development centers 
in war zones and invested 47 million in us aid in economic and 
social infrastructure 
but some contras said over the weekend they would rather go home 
than go to the development centers 
very few of us are going to go to the center because we prefer 
to see our people whom we have gone years without seeing said 
filemon cruz lopez 18 who said he joined the contras when he was 
10 
we want to know what happened to our homes he said 
he was among about 800 contras who turned in weapons saturday in 
el almendro a unpoliced security zone set up for demobilization 
purposes 115 miles southeast of managua in rio san juan province 
officials of the peacekeeping forces said it could take 10 days 
for the rest of the contras to disarm and be processed 
only 10 percent of the demobilized and disarmed rebels here 
have said they want to go to the development areas said daniel 
lozano chief of operations of the un international verification 
and support commission the rest prefer that we take them home 
manuel garay 36 a farmer from plan de grama in northern 
nicaraguas jinotega province said he has no land but still 
prefers home to the development centers 
i havent done anything bad to anyone from my place i dont 
owe anyone anything there i believe i can return and go back to my

the supreme court today made it easier for 
federal judges to penalize lawyers who file lawsuits determined to 
be improper or frivolous 
the court voting 81 ruled against cooter amp gell a 
washington dc law firm penalized 21402 for filing an 
antitrust suit based on research deemed inadequate 
the justices said a judge had authority to impose the fine even 
though the law firm agreed to drop the suit 
cooter amp gell represented dashs designer a now bankrupt 
discount mens clothing store 
dashs filed an antitrust suit against hartmarx corp 
manufacturers and distributors of hickeyfreeman and hart 
schaffner amp marx mens clothing 
dashs said hartmarx illegally sold the brands exclusively to 
only one retailer in each of various major cities nationwide 
cooter amp gell relied in part on research by a secretary at the 
law firm who telephoned some retailers in washington and three 
other cities to determine whether hartmarx had such an exclusivity 
policy 
hartmarx later asked for dismissal of the cooter amp gell suit 
after submitting affidavits that showed it distributed to as many 
as 20 different retailers in some markets 
the law firm agreed to drop the suit 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the 21402 
penalty against cooter amp gell last year the appeals court invoked 
a rule against frivolous suits noting that cooter amp gells claims 
were not supported by the skimpy research it performed 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the high court today 
said the law firms withdrawal of the suit did not divest the 
federal courts of power to impose such sanctions 
justice john paul stevens dissented he said the ruling 
undermines another rule encouraging the withdrawal of groundless 
suits 
the high court today overturned part of the appeals court ruling 
that would have cost cooter amp gell more money oconnor said 
hartmarx is not entitled to be reimbursed for legal fees it 
incurred in fighting appeals brought by cooter amp gell 
the case is cooter amp gell vs hartmarx 89275

abdominal biopsy on miss taylor that detected no sign of infection

firms answering service to trick the news media into the phony 
story about miss taylor who has been hospitalized for two months 
the story said miss taylor was expected to be released from the 
hospital within two weeks and would leave on the arm of her 
23yearold boyfriend julian lee hobbs of lake orion a suburb of 
detroit 
the story also said doctors over the weekend performed an 
abdominal biopsy on miss taylor that detected no sign of infection 
the source for the associated press story was a woman who gave 
her name as lisa flowers and who was reached through the answering 
service at miss taylors public relations firm chen sam and 
associates in new york city 
the story also quoted a woman who identified herself as chen sam 
as confirming the report saying its a very romantic story 
but today ms sam said from her new york office that the whole 
report was a fabrication 
this isnt true it is a hoax ms sam said this morning 
i have contacted miss taylors attorneys and we are going to 
conduct an investigation 
it is apparently somebody using my telephone service this 
woman is impersonating me 
the hoaxer also confirmed the information for united press 
international which also gave the story wide distribution 
were still trying to unthread it now said bob martin 
upis bureau chief in los angeles we had trouble getting hold of 
chen sam and now it turns out we didnt get ahold of her after 
all 
the ap office in los angeles had placed calls to the hospital 
and miss taylors publicist after receiving a message sunday from 
an ap affiliate in england the press association whose editors 
had heard miss taylor had undergone another operation and wanted a 
story 
a call was placed to the hospital for spokeswoman paulette weir 
but she was unavailable on sunday 
since most of miss taylors publicity is handled by chen sam and 
associates of new york an ap reporter in los angeles left a 
message with the agencys answering servicects on players from 
all countries 
when cameroon played peru in the 1982 world cup he said it 
was our sorcerers against their sorcerers 
but tsala mbala said the players have proven their ability in 
tying peru poland and eventual champion italy eight years ago and 
by last weeks upset of argentina 
the players didnt need magic against argentina he said 
they simply were stronger physically and emotionally

the soviet arsenal of longrange nuclear 
weapons remains a threat despite improved relations between the 
united states and the soviet union secretary of defense dick 
cheney said monday 
perestroika has a long long way to go cheney told the 
american israel public affairs committee the chief proisraeli 
lobbying organization in the united states 
cheney described the recent summit meeting between president 
bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev as useful and 
productive 
the relationship between the two superpowers clearly has been 
moving toward a new footing he said 
however he said the threat of a soviet land invasion in 
europe may have declined but the soviet strategic arsenal is still 
a threat 
cheney also predicted that 15 countries are expected to be 
producing ballistic missiles by the year 2000 
he said the list included iran iraq libya syria and north 
korea he said at least six of the 15 will have intermediate range 
missiles by the turn of the century 
the defense secretary said 23 countries have confirmed or 
suspected chemical warfare programs and 10 have or may have 
biological warfare programs 
iraq has been the source of some particularly disturbing news 
in recent months he said noting its attempts to acquire 
electronic trigger mechanisms suitable for nuclear weapons a claim 
to possess sophisticated chemical weapons and a recent televised 
test for a first stage booster rocket 
baghdad television has claimed that iraq has developed two 
missiles with ranges of 2000 kilometers he said although we 
do not believe that claim it is a fact that baghdad is now 
producing missiles that can reach israel 
in answer to questions after his speech cheney said 
he hopes to visit israel in the very near future after a 
new government is installed he said he had planned a trip in may 
but put it off because of the political instability in the country 
although the situation in iraq has worsened he would leave 
it to the state department to determine whether such steps as 
economic sanctions would be justified 
as far as he knows bush has not decided whether to break off or 
suspend talks with the palestine liberation organization in the 
wake of the aborted may 30 attack on a tel aviv beach he said the 
united states was horrified by the attack and it is causing 
us very seriously to review the dialogue with the plo

defendants charged under a federal law banning 
desecration of the american flag cheered the us supreme courts 
decision monday to declare the law unconstitutional people 
won one of them said 
in a 54 decision the court held the government cannot prohibit 
burning of the flag simply because society finds the idea itself 
offensive or disagreeable 
i feel great said jennifer campbell 23 of seattle one of 
four people charged with burning a flag outside a seattle post 
office shortly after the law went into effect oct 28 
for all those people who told me protesting didnt do 
anything ive just proved them wrong for once the system may 
have worked 
people won said carlos garza 33 thats what really 
excites me time now that people start standing up and quit 
allowing their government to tear down our rights 
garza campbell darius colin strong and mark haggerty were 
charged in the case the first constitutional challenge to the law 
the case and charges stemming from a flag burning in washington 
dc were combined in the governments appeal to the high court 
the justices said the flag protection act of 1989 violates 
freedom of expression guaranteed by the first amendment 
congressional leaders had said if the law were declared invalid 
they would move quickly on a constitutional amendment to protect 
the flag from burning or desecration 
a constitutional amendment would require approval by twothirds 
of the members of the house and senate and then ratification by 38 
state legislatures we are very happy that the court has stood up 
for individual rights of expression against a congress that sought 
to incarcerate our clients simply for engaging in political 
expression said david cole a lawyer with the center for 
constitutional rights in new york who had represented the 
defendants 
cole garza and campbell all said they would protest any attempt 
to pass a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag desecration 
the battle has just begun garza said were not going to 
allow them to put it in the constitution tear it down for 
something like this 
the seattle defendants still face charges of destruction of 
government property 
the law made it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison for 
anyone who burns mutilates defaces tramples the flag or 
maintains it on the floor or ground 
the latter phrase was prompted by a chicago art exhibit last 
year in which viewers were invited to stand on a flag and write 
comments about the display in a ledger 
the flag cases reached the court after federal judges in the 
district of columbia and seattle said the federal law violates 
first amendment rights

an american drug rehabilitation center has agreed 
to help the government tackle chinas growing problem with drug 
addiction the head of the us program said monday 
monsignor william b obrien said his new yorkbased daytop 
village would collaborate in a drug treatment center in kunming 
capital of yunnan province in southwestern china 
yunnan borders burma and laos and has long been a favorite route 
for heroin and opium smugglers from the socalled golden triangle 
the lawless border areas of those southeast asian nations and 
thailand 
the beijing government which until recently denied the 
existence of drug addiction in china now acknowledges that 
narcotics abuse is common in rural yunnan and that 70 percent of 
the provinces crime is drugrelated 
the government also revealed late last year that 146 
aidsinfected intravenous drug users were discovered in a remote 
village on yunnans border with burma previously only seven 
chinese nationals had been recognized as carriers of the aids virus 
theres a real concern in the yunnan province area obrien 
said the roman catholic priest left for kunming early monday after 
two days of talks with ministry of health officials 
under the agreement daytop village will help set up a 30bed 
therapeutic community based on the organizations principles 
that former addicts should help others kick the habit in a 
drugfree family workoriented environment 
daytop will finance construction of the center train four 
chinese staff members in the united states and send one 
chinesespeaking expert to china obrien said the american would 
stay for up to three years after which the chinese would run the 
operation 
obrien said daytop which he helped found in 1963 has 
collaborated in drug programs in 54 countries he said the chinese 
approached him after an official toured a daytopbacked drug center 
in thailand 
china has set up two drug rehabilitation centers in yunnan since 
1988 a treatment center was opened in beijing last year mainly to 
cure those addicted to prescription drugs

the transalaska oil pipeline will be 
shut down for about 12 hours tuesday to replace corroded lines at 
several pump stations officials said 
the lines could begin leaking if left unrepaired said marnie 
isaacs spokeswoman for the alyeska pipeline service co 
the affected steel pipes are not buried and are smaller than the 
48inch diameter line that links prudhoe bay with the marine 
terminal at valdez about 800 miles to the south she said 
the corrosion apparently was caused by bacteria in water mixed 
with the north slope crude oil she said sea water is injected 
into oil fields to increase pressure making it easier to recover 
the oil 
weve noticed it in numerous places in several pump 
stations she said theres a very very small percentage of 
water thats in the oil and that starts a corrosion process 
the corrosion has occurred mostly at the northernmost pump 
stations and is worst at pump station no 1 at prudhoe bay she 
said 
its not a threat to the line right now but internal 
corrosion is a more rapid form of corrosion than weve seen along 
the mainline pipe its something we do need to address ms 
isaacs said if left unrepaired there would be a danger of 
leakage 
alyeska which operates the pipeline for a consortium of seven 
oil companies has said it plans to spend some 800 million to 
repair external corrosion on the main line during the next five 
years state officials have said that repair costs could top 1 
billion 
alyeska will continue to receive about 20000 barrels of oil per 
hour during the shutdown compared with the standard 73000 
barrelperhouraverage the oil will be held in two tanks that 
have a combined capacity of about 350000 barrels 
because of the shutdown about 636000 fewer barrels of oil will 
flow through the line tuesday than normal

john m poindexter was sentenced today to six 
months in prison for lying to congress to conceal key details of 
the irancontra affair when he was president reagans national 
security adviser 
poindexter showed no emotion as he stood before the judge for 
sentencing saying only your honor i dont have any comment 
he then became the first irancontra defendant sentenced to prison 
us district judge harold h greene told the retired navy 
admiral that imprisonment was necessary to deter other public 
officials from lying while conducting governmental business 
greene said that a sentence without incarceration would be 
tantamount to a statement that to lie to and to obstruct congress 
was of no great moment 
admiral poindexter and his associates obstructed the congress 
nullifying the decisions that body had made by cutting off 
direct military aid to nicaraguan contras greene said 
greene did not impose a fine and said poindexter could remain 
free while he appealed the five felony convictions of making false 
statements to congress and obstructing the inquiries of lawmakers 
into the irancontra affair 
but the judge made it clear that he felt that poindexters 
crimes were serious rejecting a defense argument that the retired 
navy officerss 33 years of service to the government should weigh 
against incarceration 
with all due respect ot the distinguished military records of 
admiral poindexter and other irancontra defendants they had 
no standing in a democratic society to ignore the decisions of 
elected officials 
greene noted that under federal sentencing guidelines which do 
not affect this case because they took effect after the irancontra 
affair poindexter would have been sentenced to 21 months to 27 
months for the five felonies 
but the judge said that he would not force poindexter 53 to 
serve such a lengthy sentence while six other irancontra 
codefendants had received terms of probation 
he also noted that poindexter conducted his defense in a 
responsible but not a dishonest or disruptive manner an apparent 
reference to norths trial tactics two years ago 
without naming north greene said that unlike other 
defendants poindexter did not take the stand to exculpate himself 
by lying under oath 
the comment was an obvious reference to testimony by north the 
only irancontra defendant to testify on his own behalf 
poindexter was convicted april 7 of conspiracy two counts of 
making false statements and two counts of obstructing congressional 
inquiries 
while poindexters lawyers argued that he had suffered enough 
and should not be sent to prison chief prosecutor lawrence e 
walsh argued that poindexters role as a topranking official was 
different from those of the other irancontra defendants including 
north 
the judge said that after the irancontra affair unraveled 
poindexter and north engaged in the destruction of evidence one 
step ahead of the congress and two steps ahead of the attorney 
general and the fbi 
prosecutor dan k webb told greene that he had no doubt that 
poindexter was a decent honorable man who had served his country 
as a naval officer and adviser to reagan but webb said that 
poindexters crime was not an isolated incident 
he called it a prolonged and protracted course of conduct to 
obstruct congress 
he said that the irancontra affair is a classic example of 
what happens when these laws are violated 
we literally had this admiral and one very misguided and 
confused lieutenant colonel operating a private war in nicaragua 
and congress didnt know about it webb said referring to the 
secret efforts to arm the contras after congress shut off aid 
defense lawyer richard beckler urged greene to spare poindexter 
a prison term citing his accomplishments as a career naval officer 
beckler said that when he served as reagans national security 
adviser i dont think anyone can appreciate the power and 
pressure that bore on him 
every step can be a misstep clearly missteps were taken 
here beckler said 
but both greene and the prosecutor noted that poindexter had 
shown no remorse or acceptance of his guilt while pleading for 
leniency 
poindexter served as reagans national security adviser from 
late 1985 until the revelations about the irancontra affair forced 
his resignation in november 1986 
a jury found poindexter guilty of making false statements to 
congress by denying in a letter that north and others were secretly 
helping the contras 
he was also convicted of making false statements and altering or 
destroying documents to conceal white house knowledge of an israeli 
shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran in 1985 
prosecutors contended that poindexter denied that he knew 
anything about the shipment until january 1986 to conceal a 
politically embarrassing memo signed by reagan that linked the 
weapons sales to the release of american hostages in lebanon 
subsequent intelligence findings signed by reagan to 
authorize other weapons sales said the purpose of the deals was to 
establish contact with political moderates in iran as well as seek 
release of hostages 
as details of usiran arms shipments unfolded in the fall of 
1986 reagan denied that he ever engaged in a pure trade of arms 
for hostages he said the initiative also was undertaken to make 
contact with political moderates in iran 
also convicted of irancontra crimes were arms dealers albert 
hakim and richard v secord conservative fundraisers richard 
miller and the late carl r spitz channell and former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane

the plo today issued what appeared to be a 
condemnation of an abortive guerrilla raid against israel last 
month after the united states threatened to cut off dialogue with 
the plo over the incident 
the plo position remains unchanged we are against any 
military action that targets civilians whatever form it may 
take said the statement by an unidentified plo spokesman in 
baghdad and distributed by the plos official news agency wafa 
the palestine liberation organization is still committed 
to the peace process on the basis of international legitimacy and 
palestinian peace initiatives the spokesman said 
plo chairman yasser arafat has disassociated the plo from the 
may 30 attack by a plo faction on a tel aviv beach but he has 
fallen short of personally condemning it 
in washington the state department today said it was 
disappointed that the plo did not explicitly condemn the abortive 
raid but department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also said the 
bush administration has not yet decided whether to suspend the 
18monthold dialogue with arafats organization 
weve never put a timeframe on it the spokeswoman said at a 
daily news briefing 
wafa reported that in tunisia today us ambassador robert 
pelletreau met with plo representative hakam balaoui in the capital 
tunis the plo news agency said the two discussed moves to 
achieve peace in the middle east but did not reveal whether the 
latest plo statement was discussed 
sixteen guerrillas of the palestine liberation front one of the 
nine factions under the plo umbrella launched the attack four of 
the guerrillas were killed in the shootout with israeli troops and 
the rest were arrested there were no casualties among the israelis 
we also condemn the israeli crimes and massacres against our 
workers and children that increase day by day the plo statement 
the beach attack followed rioting that had raged in israel and 
israelioccupied territories since may 20 when an israeli civilian 
shot dead seven arab laborers and wounded 11 near tel aviv 
todays announcement came after sweden moved to prevent a 
possible break in the talks between the united states and the plo 
arab diplomatic sources said in baghdad 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said sweden had 
been trying to convince the plo to respond to the us demand that 
the plo condemn the foiled raid 
president bush said last week that he was considering breaking 
off the dialogue after arafat failed to condemn outright the attack 
on the israeli beach or fire the palestine liberation fronts 
leader mohammed abbas from the plos ruling executive committee 
abbas better known as abul abbas was the mastermind of the 
1985 hijacking of the achille lauro cruise liner in which a 
wheelchairbound american was shot and his body pushed overboard 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson sent an envoy mathias 
mossberg to baghdad at the weekend with a message to arafat 
mossberg met with arafat three times since he arrived saturday 
andersson helped initiate the usplo dialogue in december 1988 
in december 1988 arafat renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist opening the way for the uspalestinian 
dialogue to begin 
since then there have been regular meetings between plo 
officials and pelletreau 
four us senators last week urged a cutoff in the talks

appeals was renamed monday for elbert parr tuttle the courts 
oldest living judge 
tuttle 92 was appointed to the federal bench by president 
eisenhower in 1954 he has been a parttime senior judge since 1968

no court of appeals judge does anything by himself nothing that 
i did was any different from what was done by the majority of the 
court sitting at that time 
he became a leader of the 5th circuit when it served as the 
legal battleground for the civil rights movement the 11th circuit 
later split off from the 5th circuit 
the name change for the downtown courthouse was an exception to 
the federal governments policy against naming public buildings 
after living people 
the courthouse is where police intercepted a december mail bomb 
intended for the 11th circuit

here is the text of the palestine 
liberation organization statement released monday which was 
telefaxed from tunis tunisia and translated from arabic by the 
associated press 
the new israeli government is a war cabinet and a cabinet of 
oppression for our people it is also a cabinet for the 
collaborators the dangers posed by this government on palestinian 
arab and international levels is apparent in the program it has 
announced 
it is an extension of the previous governments which have 
rejected all peace initiatives for its head is none other than 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who has rejected all the 
international peace initiatives including the 10point egyptian 
proposal and the baker plan despite the fact the palestine 
liberation organization had responded postively and in a high 
spirit of responsibility to these initiatives 
the plo is still committed to all its obligations declared in 
geneva in 1988 and to the peace process on the basis of 
international legitimacy and palestinian peace initiatives 
everybody knows that this is a government of warmongers and 
extremists to prepare for a war against the arab countries and 
escalate aggression and expansion in the occupied territories 
the recent arab summit meeting made it clear that it rejects the 
state of nowar nopeace concentrating instead on the palestinian 
peace initiative which has been reconfirmed by this and the 
previous summits with a view to sparing the region catastrophic war 
with weapons of destruction that are proliferating in our area be 
they conventional nuclear or other kind of weapons hence our 
concept of peace and prevention of a possible catastrophic war 
this is the line we still adhere to 
the plo position remains unchanged we are against any military 
action that targets civilians whatever form it may take and 
whatever the results of such actions we also condemn the israeli 
crimes and massacres against our workers and children women and 
people that increase day by day as a result of protection that the 
us veto provides to israel and the continued american support of 
israel

the supreme court ruled monday that congress 
violated freespeech rights when it outlawed flag burning last 
year the decision immediately set off a new political fight over 
amending the constitution to protect old glory 
speaking for the 54 majority justice william j brennan said 
punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that 
makes this emblem so revered 
president bush and republican congressional leaders urged quick 
electionyear action to overturn the ruling by amending the first 
amendment for the first time in its 199year history 
bush told reporters he strongly favors changing the 
constitution and that he would continue to press for what i 
strongly believe is in the public interest 
house minority leader robert michel rill predicted an 
amendment would be backed by overwhelming majorities in both houses 
who wants to be against the flag mother and apple pie he 
said 
however democrats prepared to fight what they saw as a 
dangerous effort to alter the bill of rights 
i hold no brief for the flagburners i condemn their ugly 
actions unequivocally said sen edward m kennedy dmass but 
i also reject the suggestion that the only means left for us to 
honor the flag is to carve a loophole in the first amendment we 
dont need to destroy the first amendment in order to save the 
american flag 
a vote in the house could come within two or three weeks said a 
spokesman for house speaker thomas s foley dwash foley opposes 
revising the first amendment but has promised not to block house 
action on the proposal 
a constitutional amendment requires approval by twothirds of 
the members of the house and senate and then ratification by 38 
state legislatures 
the issue is expected to be a hot issue in this falls 
congressional and state legislative races 
in other action monday the court 
ruled unanimously in a case from minnesota that the federal 
government may order state national guard troops to take part in 
peacetime training abroad over a governors opposition 
gave police broad new power to stop and question someone based 
on anonymous tips the 63 ruling reinstated an alabama womans 
drug conviction 
ruled 72 that the federal government can cut benefits paid 
to recipients who relied on a government workers incorrect answers 
about their eligibility 
refused to let a private jewish group display a menorah in a 
public park near the burlington vt city hall 
agreed to study the power of federal prosecutors to seize 
sexually explicit material and business records from distributors 
of adult books and films 
in the flagburning case brennan wrote for the court we are 
aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to many 
but he said if there is a bedrock principle underlying the 
first amendment it is that the government may not prohibit the 
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself 
offensive or disagreeable 
justice john paul stevens said in a dissenting opinion that the 
government has a legitimate interest in banning flag burning 
the flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty equality 
and tolerance ideas that americans have passionately defended and 
debated throughout our history he said the flag embodies the 
spirit of our national commitment to those ideals 
but stevens also criticized unnamed political leaders who he 
said urge allegiance to the flag for partisan gain 
the integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those 
leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by 
individuals whom it offends or who seem to manipulate the symbol 
of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about 
meaner ends he said 
brennan was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy siding with 
stevens to allow a ban on flag burning were chief justice william 
h rehnquist and justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor 
the vote split was identical a year ago when the court struck 
down a similar texas law against flag desecration 
the 1989 decision touched off a political firestorm that led to 
the federal law invalidated monday democrats in congress hoping 
to head off a constitutional amendment and neutralize republican 
use of the flag issue sponsored the legislation 
bush who emphasized patriotic values in his 1988 campaign 
against democratic gov michael dukakis of massachusetts allowed 
the bill to become law without his signature he said he preferred 
a constitutional amendment 
protesters who burned the flag in seattle and in washington 
dc in defiance of the law were jubilant monday 
if people are free to wave the flag in approval of the 
government they must be just as free to burn the flag to express 
disapproval said david cole a lawyer who represented the 
flagburning protesters 
the federal law made it a crime punishable by a up to a year in 
prison for anyone who burns mutilates defaces tramples the flag 
or maintains it on the floor or ground 
the criminal penalties in the federal law applied equally to 
those who defaced or burned their own flag or one owned by someone 
else

the supreme court gave police broad new 
authority monday to stop and question people on the basis of 
anonymous tips three justices said the ruling makes a mockery of 
individual privacy 
the court by a 63 vote said anonymous tips can justify such 
police tactics if the information is corroborated before the person 
is stopped and questioned 
but the corroboration police gather does not have to be criminal 
in nature the court said 
the decision reinstated vanessa whites 1987 conviction in 
alabama and the twoyear probationary sentence she received for 
possessing marijuana and cocaine a state court had thrown out the 
conviction ruling that montgomery ala police seized drugs after 
unlawfully stopping her car 
police had received a tip from an unknown caller who said ms 
white would be leaving her house at a certain time to drive to a 
motel and that she would be carrying illegal drugs 
officers went to ms whites home watched her leave and drive 
away they followed and stopped her car close to the motel she 
consented to the search in which the drugs were discovered 
although it is a close case we conclude that under the 
totality of the circumstances the anonymous tip as corroborated 
exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the 
investigatory stop of ms whites car justice byron r white 
wrote for the court 
the court previously has ruled that police can make arrests only 
when they have probable cause to believe someone is involved in 
a crime but the justices have allowed police to make brief 
investigatory stops to question and even frisk someone if they have 
a reasonable suspicion a more lenient standard than probable 
cause 
federal appeals courts and state courts ad been divided in 
recent years when ruling whether an anonymous tip to police can 
give rise to such a reasonable suspicion mondays decision said it 
can 
it is not unreasonable to conclude in this case white said 
that the independent corroboration by the police of significant 
aspects of the informers predictions imparted some degree of 
reliability to the other allegations made by the caller 
the courts three dissenters justices john paul stevens 
william j brennan and thurgood marshall denounced the decision 
millions of people leave their apartments at about the same 
time every day heading for a destination known to their 
neighbors stevens wrote for the three 
under the courts holding every citizen is subject to being 
seized and questioned by any officer who is prepared to testify 
that the warrantless stop was based on an anonymous tip predicting 
whatever conduct the officer just observed stevens said 
the vast majority of those in our law enforcement community 
would not adopt such a practice he added but the fourth 
amendment was intended to protect the citizen from the overzealous 
and unscrupulous officer as well as from those who are 
conscientious and truthful 
this decision makes a mockery of that protection stevens 
said 
the constitutions fourth amendment bans unreasonable police 
searches and seizures

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 54 
decision monday that overturned the federal law banning flag 
burning 
the opinion of the court was written by justice william j 
brennan justice john paul stevens wrote the dissent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from the majority opinion 
the governments interest in protecting the physical 
integrity of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived need 
to preserve the flags status as a symbol of our nation and certain 
national ideals but the mere destruction or disfigurement of a 
particular physical manifestation of the symbol without more does 
not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way 
the governments interest cannot justify its infringement on 
first amendment rights we decline the governments invitation to 
reassess this conclusion in light of congress recent recognition 
of a purported national consensus favoring a prohibition on 
flagburning even assuming such a consensus exists any 
suggestion that the governments interest in suppressing speech 
becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is 
foreign to the first amendment 
government may create national symbols promote them and 
encourage their respectful treatment but the flag protection act 
goes well beyond this by criminally proscribing expressive conduct 
because of its likely communicative impact 
we are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to 
many but the same might be said for example of virulent ethnic 
and religious epithets vulgar repudiations of the draft and 
scurrilous caricatures punishing desecration of the flag 
dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered and 
worth revering 
 
from the dissent 
the flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty equality and 
tolerance ideas that americans have passionately defended and 
debated throughout our history the flag embodies the spirit of our 
national commitment to those ideals 
the flag is a reminder both that the struggle for liberty 
and equality is unceasing and that our obligation of tolerance and 
respect for all of our fellow citizens encompasses those who 
disagree with us indeed even those whose ideas are disagreeable 
or offensive 
thus the government may indeed it should protect the 
symbolic value of the flag without regard to the specific content 
of the flag burners speech 
the prohibition does not entail any interference with the 
speakers freedom to express his or her ideas by other means it 
may well be true that other means of expression may be less 
effective in drawing attention to those ideas but that is not 
itself a sufficient reason for immunizing flag burning 
the freedom of expression protected by the first amendment 
embraces not only the freedom to communicate particular ideas but 
also the right to communicate them effectively that right 
however is not absolute the communicative value of a wellplaced 
bomb in the capitol does not entitle it to the protection of the 
first amendment 
the integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those 
leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by 
individuals whom it offends or who seem to manipulate the symbol 
of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about 
meaner ends

yitzhak shamir a former guerrilla and spy has 
fought most of his life for one goal a greater israel in 
which jews are safe from what he sees as a hostile world 
this vision will shape shamirs agenda in his fourth term as 
prime minister and leader of israels new rightwing coalition 
government sworn in monday 
shamir has said israel must return not an inch of occupied 
arab land and instead expand jewish settlements in the west bank 
and gaza strip land won from the arabs in the 1967 middle east war 
his likud bloc wants the territories as a security buffer and 
as an intergral part of israel 
the polishborn shamirs emphasis on security has its roots in 
the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed by the nazis 
shamirs father was betrayed to the nazis by residents of his 
village most of the rest of his family also perished 
shamir 74 has balked at attempts by the united states to prod 
him toward a more conciliatory approach with the palestinians his 
new government calls for uprooting the 30monthold uprising in 
the occupied lands the revolt has claimed 717 palestinian lives 
45 israelis also have died 
standing little more than 5 feet 2 inches tall shamir often 
presents a glowering appearance with his bushy white eyebrows and 
clipped moustache 
he was born yitzhak ysernitzky on oct 15 1915 in ruznoy 
poland as a teenager he joined betar a rightwing zionist 
movement that wanted a jewish state in all of britishmandated 
palestine on both sides of the jordan river 
he immigrated to palestine in 1935 and was quickly drawn into 
the clandestine movement to end british rule and establish the 
state of israel 
he twice escaped from british jails including one getaway from 
a lockup in eritrea in which he rode hundreds of miles through 
sweltering desert heat in the empty tank of a water truck 
shamir eventually became a leader of the militant stern gang 
blamed for the slaying of britains middle east resident minister 
lord moyne and swedish un mediator count folke bernadotte who 
opposed making jerusalem part of israel 
after independence shamir went into business for several 
unhappy years and in 1955 became a parisbased agent for 
mossad israels secret service 
in 1965 after reaching a senior level he retired from the 
intelligence service and managed a rubber factory until his 
predecessor menachem begin the likud founder brought him into 
politics in 1970 
shamir built a career on loyalty to begin serving as knesset 
speaker and foreign minister before taking over as premier in 1983 
when begin suddenly quit 
but he opposed begins main achievement the 1978 camp david 
accords that led to israels 1979 peace treaty with egypt 
shamir said at the time israel could not trust the egyptians he 
now argues that yasser arafat lies when he claims the plo has 
abandoned terrorism and seeks peace with israel 
he also opposed israels withdrawal from lebanon and the labor 
partys attempts with jordans king hussein to arrange an 
international peace conference

president vaclav havel will 
probably retain a former communist as prime minister and ask him to 
form the nations next government havels spokesman said monday 
prime minister marian calfa turned in his communist party card 
after last winters revolution and his continued role as prime 
minster for the next two years could draw criticism from havels 
allies and the christian democrats havel hopes to include in a 
coalition government 
many of his allies helped in the fight to smash communist rule 
last winter 
the civic forum movement havel founded to lead the revolution 
and its slovak ally public against violence easily won weekend 
parliamentary elections the first free balloting in 44 years 
together the parties received about 46 percent of the vote for the 
new national legislature 
the final seat allocation is to be announced wednesday but 
projections showed they would receive about 170 of the 300 seats 
the communists in a surprisingly strong showing won about 13 
percent of the vote for about 48 seats and an alliance of three 
christian democrat parties about 12 percent for 40 seats 
separatist movements representing slovaks moravians in the 
central czech lands and the ethnic hungarian minority in slovakia 
were the only other parties to win seats in the voting friday and 
saturday 
in washington the state department said it congratulated the 
czechoslovakian people on their achievement in holding free and 
fair elections and in their hardfought battle for representative 
democracy 
the christian democrats and the moravian parties are the most 
likely coalition partners for civic forum presidential spokesman 
michael zantovsky said 
all parties have ruled out a coalition with the communists and 
civic forum said sunday it did not want even respected experts like 
the current foreign trade minister andrej barcak a communist to 
stay in government 
however zantovsky told a news conference monday that the former 
communist calfa probably would be entrusted with the role of 
forming a new government 
he did not say why havel would choose calfa to stay on 
the parliament will elect a president in july and havel has 
said he will run only if he can appoint a government guaranteed to 
act in the national interest 
i think hes perfectly sincere in not insisting on staying 
zantovsky said what he seems to be saying basically is that he 
can only work with a certain kind of government 
havels stand puts pressure on all politicians to form the kind 
of government havel seeks czechoslovakias young democracy is so 
closely identified with the popular president that a crisis could 
ensue if he steps down 
but jan carnogursky a leader of the slovak christian democrats 
and another christian democrat party the peoples party may 
refuse to join the new government 
by tradition if the president is a czech as havel is the 
premier should be a slovak 
carnogursky like havel a respected former dissident was 
havels clear choice for premier during last winters revolution 
but now havel apparently prefers calfa who has less charisma 
than carnogursky and because of his unfashionably communist past 
may pose less of a challenge to the president 
public against violence campaigners hinted before the elections 
that they would not be happy with the choice of an excommunist as 
premier 
carnogursky told the voice of america radio station sunday night 
he was not prepared to play fifth fiddle in the new government 
zantovsky said he believed the slovak christian democrat would 
get a responsible position in the new government and that it 
was likely carnogursky and havel would discuss the matter tuesday 
the peoples party meanwhile is angry over allegations by 
havel aides that its chairman josef bartoncik was a secret police 
agent for 17 years 
while not defending bartoncik the party charged that havels 
government had used dirty tricks to smear bartoncik just before 
the elections and damage christian democrat chances

the palestine liberation organization in a 
bid to salvage its dialogue with the united states on monday 
condemned attacks on civilians but it did not specifically 
denounce a guerrilla raid on an israeli beach 
washington criticized the plo for failing to explicitly condemn 
the raid implying that the statement failed to meet us 
antiterrorism conditions however the plo news agency wafa 
reported another usplo meeting took place monday in tunisia 
the united states has threatened to cut off its 18monthold 
dialogue with the plo over its refusal to condemn the foiled may 30 
attack by a plo faction plo chief yasser arafat has disassociated 
the organization from the raid but has not personally condemned it 
the plo position remains unchanged we are against any 
military action that targets civilians whatever form it may 
take said mondays plo statement issued by a spokesman in 
baghdad and distributed by the official palestinian news hijacking of 
the achille lauro cruise liner in which a wheelchairbound american 
was shot and his body dumped overboard 
the beach raid followed rioting in israel and the 
israelioccupied territories after the may 20 fatal shooting by an 
israeli of seven arab laborers near tel aviv eleven were wounded 
the plo statement condemned what it called israeli crimes and 
massacres against our workers and children that increase day by 
day 
the statement came after sweden moved to prevent a possible 
break in the talks between the united states and the plo arab 
diplomatic sources said in baghdad 
sweden was instrumental in beginning the dialogue in december 
1988 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson sent an envoy mathias 
mossberg to baghdad over the weekend with a message to arafat as 
of monday mossberg had met with arafat three times 
the arab diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said sweden had been trying to persuade the plo to condemn the 
foiled raid 
the usplo dialogue began after arafat renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist 
since then there have been regular meetings between plo 
officials and pelletreau 
on monday the plo spokesman said the organization is still 
committed to all its obligations declared in geneva in 1988 and to 
the peace process on the basis of international legitimacy and 
palestinian peace initiatives

the white house said monday it has stepped up 
security for us ambassador to south korea donald p gregg after 
death threats from student radicals 
south korean police clashed with students in kwangju as gregg 
reopened a us cultural center that has been repeatedly attacked 
some 500 students hurled rocks and firebombs at police who 
blocked them from marching off the campus of chosun university 
they had claimed they had formed death squads to kidnap gregg 
during his visit to kwangju 
the city 155 miles south of seoul is a hotbed of antius 
sentiment the radicals accuse the united states of condoning the 
lethal suppression of antigovernment demonstrations in 1980 when 
south korea was still under military rule 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we take all 
such threats seriously and be assured that we are taking the proper 
security measures and that they are in place 
fitzwater noted radicals broke into greggs residence last 
october the ambassador and his wife escaped unharmed he said the 
united states took a number of security measures to augment the 
situation after that incident 
gregg in a ribboncutting ceremony at the cultural center in 
kwangju said the united states had erred in remaining silent for 
nine years about the kwangju uprising american silence had 
contributed to a hardening of suspicions and mistrust among some 
south koreans he said 
gregg is a former cia station chief in seoul and a national 
security adviser to thenvice president bush during the reagan 
administration

while americans overwhelmingly voice support for 
a constitutional ban on flag burning researchers say that view is 
based more on emotion than on any analysis of freespeech issues 
from reciting the pledge of allegiance to singing the national 
anthem at ballgames rituals celebrating the flag are so ingrained 
in american society they raise it to the level of an icon social 
researchers said 
its a value thats been engendered since childhood from cub 
scouts to the fourth of july parade said tom smith general 
social survey director at the national opinion research center in 
chicago this is deeply rooted 
as such americans who are asked their view on flagburning are 
unlikely to mull the freespeech issues that come before the us 
supreme court said smith instead what we see is a lot of 
visceral reaction to it 
that reaction showed up strongly in surveys after the supreme 
court first ruled last summer that flag burning is a form of free 
speech seven in 10 respondents and more in some polls opposed 
the ruling 
nearly as many roughly twothirds in several surveys said they 
favored a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning that issue 
is likely to resurface now that the court reaffirmed its ruling 
monday 
smith said those opinions are unlikely to change over time 
because they are based on deepseated values rather than current 
events this is a deep symbolic attachment he said these 
kinds of opinions go back to childhood and socialization they are 
very hard to sway 
but howard schuman director of the survey research center at 
the university of michigan said opinions on such matters can 
change quickly precisely because they are questioned so rarely 
a sociologist has coined the phrase cultural cliche its 
like you should brush your teeth twice a day and you should pay 
respect to the flag said schuman there are a series of things 
like this that one learns at a very young age and are rarely 
questioned 
however he said in some cases where they do get questioned 
people quickly change because theyve never thought about it 
before everybody can switch easily when they have good reason 
to 
smith noted that warnings about the potential freespeech 
repercussions of a constitutional ban are not widely known and 
could raise opposition once they are circulated polls have not yet 
probed that possibility he said 
if a poll strongly laid out the freespeech issues before asking 
opinions on flag burning some respondents may be less apt to 
support a ban for example smith said polls find opposition to 
taxes in general but support for taxes earmarked for a positive 
purpose such as cleaning the environment 
there are certain things that to most americans sound so 
objectionable on their face that you have to explain either the 
rationale or the counterargument smith said if you just 
mention flag burning youre going to get a majority of people 
objecting youd get a lot closer to a 5050 split if you 
emphasized free speech as a part of american life

the bush administration criticized the 
palestine liberation organization on monday for not explicitly 
condemning a guerrilla raid on israels coast or taking any action 
against abul abbas the factional leader whosegroup said it was 
behind the attack 
nearly identical cool reactions by the white house and the 
state department to a new statement on the raid distributed by the 
plos official news agency wafa strongly suggested president bush 
would suspend the 16month us dialogue with yasser arafats 
organization 
vice president dan quayle assured the american israel public 
affairs committee a leading proisrael lobbying group that bush 
would make the right decision and that it would be announced 
soon 
defense secretary dick cheney addressing the same group said 
obviously we have been very concerned with the terrorist attack 
i dont think anyone can look at that and not be concerned 
about whether or not the plo is keeping the commitment they made 
when they entered into the dialogue that they would in fact 
renounce terrorism 
we should know something more in the next few days cheney 
said 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
majo american jewish organizations said the administration has 
no choice but to terminate these talks at stake is our countrys 
credibility in the war against terrorism 
the united states opened talks with the plo in december 1988 
after arafat at the behest of the reagan administration publicly 
repudiated terrorism and affirmed israels right to exist 
at the same time the reagan administration warned the plo that 
if it engaged in terrorism the dialogue would be suspended last 
friday at a news conference in turnberry scotland secretary of 
state james a baker iii said that policy had not changed 
last march the state department reported to congress that the 
plo had abided by its commitment 
while nearly 30 border and rocket attacks have been launched by 
palestinian groups against israel since december 1988 the state 
department said it had no evidence that any of the attacks were 
authorized or approved by the plo executive committee or by arafat 
personally 
the abortive may 30 raid drew an angry reaction from the bush 
administration however abbas who heads the palestine liberation 
front is a member of the executive committee 
five speedboats carrying 16 guerrillas armed with rockets and 
machine guns were reportedly dropped off a libyan ship 120 miles 
at sea the guerrillas were picked up by radar and intercepted by 
israeli defenders four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured 
last friday bush said he had not decided whether to break off 
the us dialogue with the plo but he denounced as the attack as 
sheer terror and called on arafat to speak out and condemn 
it 
over the weekend robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to 
tunisia and the sole american diplomat in direct touch with the 
plo met with plo officials white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said it was the fourth such meeting since the guerrillas tried to 
storm the tel aviv beach 
wafa reported that pelletreau met again monday with plo 
representative hakam balaoui they discussed moves to achieve 
peace in the middle east the news agency said 
the latest plo statement quoting an unidentified spokesman in 
baghdad iraq said the plo position remains unchanged we are 
against any military action that targets civilians whatever form 
it may take 
the state department which had received its own copy of the 
statement through diplomatic channels said it was pleased with 
the disavowal of military action against civilians 
however spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said we are 
disappointed that they have not explicitly condemned the tel aviv 
raid and refrained from any public comment on abul abbas 
she said there could be no question that the plo knows what it 
should do to meet us conditions there is not much doubt it 
the spokeswoman said 
for instances ms tutwiler said bush had called on arafat to 
speak out 
quayle meanwhile said the reagan administration began the 
dialogue because palestinians otherwise were less likely to become 
engaged in mideast peace efforts the vice president said the 
united states never sought to bring the plo into the process 
through the back door or sought establishment of a palestinian 
state 
baker last friday said the us dialogue with the plo was not 
part of the negotiations process 
asked when the bush administration would decide whether to 
suspend the talks with the plo ms tutwiler said weve never 
put a timeframe on it 
white house spokesman fitzwater meanwhile said there was no 
timetable for a decision

president bushs budget talks with congress 
involve taxes his spokesman indicated monday in lowering his guard 
long enough to suggest what no other white house official had yet 
publicly uttered 
but marlin fitzwater quickly amended his remarks to erase the 
taboo t word 
fitzwater was asked at his daily press briefing if there was 
significance to the fact that president bush in a series of recent 
political speeches failed to repeat his vow against tax increases 
as he talked about economic conditions 
yes fitzwater said the significance is that were 
involved in tax negotiations on the hill where we have agreed 
 
when reporters expressed astonishment fitzwater backtracked 
i mean the budget negotiations fitzwater said budget 
negotiations he repeated where we have agreed not to talk 
publicly in any way that would specify preconditions 
and we will not do so the presidents spokesman added 
bush met monday with members of his budget negotiating team led 
by budget director richard darman 
at that meeting which fitzwater also attended darman reported 
that the initial meetings have gone very well the spokesman 
said 
and while some members of congress have expressed frustration 
with the slow pace of the socalled budget summit that began 
nearly a month ago fitzwater said we think the pace is 
satisfactory 
he said congressional leaders believe a deficitcutting deal 
could be struck before the august congressional recess 
wed all like to move faster but we think its probably as 
fast as its going to go he said

a launch company monday prepared to 
send up a delta rocket with an indian communications satellite that 
was damaged first in a launch pad accident and then by northern 
californias devastating earthquake 
the unmanned rocket was scheduled to blast off at 152 am 
tuesday from cape canaveral air force station 
abid hussain indias ambassador to the united states said 
monday the satellite will benefit even the poorest and most rural 
of indias 800 million people 
we in india believe that science and technology could be put 
into the service of the people especially those people who have 
been so far behind of some of the advantages of progress said 
abid hussain indias ambassador to the united states 
through this particular satellite we would like to spread 
education and knowledge science and new culture to hundreds and 
thousands of those who have been out of the mainstream of life 
hussain told reporters 
the 80 million insat satellite will replace one that was 
deployed in 1983 by the crew of the shuttle challenger it will be 
boosted into a stationary orbit 22300 miles high about 10 days 
after liftoff said sastri vasantha project director of indias 
department of space 
once it becomes operational in midjuly the satellite will 
provide a telecommunications link in india it also will send video 
and voice signals to television radio and disaster warning 
receivers and send weather observations to a forecasting center in 
new delhi for distribution across india 
the satellite originally was scheduled to ride a delta rocket 
into orbit last june but was damaged in a launch pad accident a 
week before liftoff a cable on a crane broke and dropped a heavy 
hook on the satellite 
ford aerospace which built the satellite returned the 
spacecraft to palo alto calif workers there replaced an antenna 
and made other repairs costing 10 million said fred stang 
director of business development for the company 
the earthquake that struck northern california in october caused 
further damage about a dozen cells in the satellites solar 
panels had to be replaced the cost for that was about 150000 
stang said 
ford aerospace has insured the satellite for any problems while 
it is on the ground the indian government which also has 
insurance assumes responsibility after liftoff 
because of the year delay india has had to lease the services 
of other satellite communications companies vasantha said the 
insat satellite that will be replaced is operating at about 70 
percent capacity he said 
the new spacecraft is the fourth and final in a series of 
indias insat 1 satellites it has a working lifetime of seven 
years an updated version the insat 2 will be carried into space 
next year by europes ariane rocket 
it is the fourth commercial launch of mcdonnell douglas delta 
rocket the rocket and launch services for tuesdays launch cost 
nearly 50 million

a governors consent is not needed for the 
federal government to order state national guard troops to take 
part in peacetime training abroad a unanimous supreme court said 
monday 
the court rejected a challenge to a 1986 federal law by 
democratic gov rudy perpich of minnesota the statute was opposed 
by other governors as well including democrat michael dukakis of 
massachusetts who made it an issue in his unsuccessful 1988 
presidential campaign 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chief sponsor of the 
law called the ruling a relief 
we just couldnt afford to have a few governors play politics 
with this issue just because they objected to the foreign policy 
objectives of the administration he said 
dukakis had opposed sending national guard troops to train in 
central america denouncing the reagan administration in 1988 for 
what he called a failed and illegal policy of supporting 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
he said sending national guard troops to the region was an 
attempt to intimidate nicaragua 
the justice department had said dukakis position was a dagger 
aimed at the heart of national defense 
by contrast perpich did not criticize reagan or bush 
administration foreign policy but emphasized states rights he 
said the constitution gives states veto power over peacetime 
training missions for national guard members 
perpich did not object when 12 members of a minnesota national 
guard public relations unit happened to be training in panama last 
december when us forces invaded to capture gen manuel noriega 
the minnesota residents returned to the united states a day after 
the invasion began 
justice john paul stevens writing monday for the majority 
rejected perpichs constitutional arguments 
the congressional power to call forth the militia may in 
appropriate cases supplement its broader power to raise armies and 
provide for the common defense and general welfare but it does not 
limit those powers stevens said 
we conclude that the montgomery amendment is not inconsistent 
with the constitutions militia clauses stevens said 
the montgomery amendment prohibits any governor from withholding 
consent to a national guards units active duty outside the 
country because of an objection to the location purpose or 
schedule of the duty 
it was enacted after several governors said they opposed the 
reagan administrations central american policy and did not want 
national guard troops from their states assigned to training 
missions in that region 
the bush administration said perpichs challenge to the federal 
law was illogical because the governor did not contest the federal 
governments power to order national guard troops to fight a war 
abroad but said the federal government lacked authority to prepare 
the troops for war 
there has been dual control over the national guard since 
congress made it a component of the army in 1933 
there are some 460000 men and women in the army national guard 
and 115000 in the air national guard 
anyone joining the national guard enrolls automatically in a 
state militia organization and a reserve component of the national 
armed forces 
the army national guard provides 46 percent of the armys combat 
units and 28 percent of its support forces 
the air national guard provides 73 percent of the nations 
interceptor forces 25 percent of tactical fighters and 24 percent 
of tactical air support 
minnesotas appeal was supported by officials from iowa maine 
massachusetts montana ohio and vermont montana later withdrew 
from the suit most other states sided with the federal government

the supreme court decision monday on the flag 
protection law set up a headbutting political showdown in congress 
on a constitutional amendment supported by president bush to outlaw 
flag burning 
there are no options left its either do nothing or have a 
constitutional amendment i think we ought to do something said 
sen bob dole rkan the senate minority leader 
the issue is not the flag the issue is whether we are going 
to amend the bill of rights countered senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine blasting dole for suggesting that those 
against the amendment support flagburners 
battle lines formed almost instantly after the supreme court 
threw out the statute congress passed last year to penalize flag 
burners without touching the constitution 
the law represented a middle ground between those including 
bush who favor a limit on constitutional guarantees of free speech 
to make an exception for the flag and those including mitchell and 
house speaker thomas s foley who view the first amendment as 
paramount 
bush said monday said he was ready to renew his quest he and 
other republicans who have used the flag issue against liberal 
democrats told those who thought the statute would pass muster i 
told you so 
some of us said ahead of time that the legislative approach 
would not be upheld he said 
well talk about it as we go around the country said bushs 
spokesman marlin fitzwater well ask the congress to pass it 
just as we did in the first case 
house minority leader bob michel rill sponsor of the 
constitutional amendment said either we amend the constitution 
as grave and complicated an undertaking as that is or else let 
the decision stand 
there is no middle ground he said 
foley dwash promised a house vote before congress leaves for 
its fourth of july recess it could come as early as next week 
when the house judiciary committee is scheduled to act 
the timing will make it more difficult to oppose the amendment 
its supporters and opponents said 
who wants to be against the flag mother and apple pie said 
michel 
it doesnt help at all it licenses the demagogues said 
rep don edwards dcalif an opponent who is chairman of the 
house judiciary committees subcommittee on the constitution 
still he said im confident were going to get enough members 
to stand up and say no i love the bill of rights 
a constitutional amendment must be passed by a twothirds vote 
in both chambers and then by 38 state legislatures to take effect 
the senate last year voted 5148 for the constitutional 
amendment 16 short of twothirds but lawmakers then had the 
statute to give them political cover 
dole and sen strom thurmond rsc reintrready for a time 
change yet fagerland would at least like to synchronize the clocks 
in his part of the state 
id like to move this confusion west he said

wideranging oilspill prevention and 
cleanup legislation was signed into law monday by gov bob 
martinez as a crippled norwegian oil tanker continued to blaze 
across the gulf of mexico 
the legislation introduced in the wake of last years 
catastrophic exxon valdez spill in alaska increases companies 
financial liability for oil spills and increases safety and 
training requirements for ships and terminals 
so much of floridas appeal rests with its unique coastline 
and we simply cant afford to risk a repeat of the tragic alaska 
oil spill here martinez said 
the governor also noted the ongoing battle to contain the 
disaster in the gulf of mexico 57 miles southeast of galveston 
texas where a supertanker carrying 38 million gallons of oil was 
set ablaze and crippled by an explosion saturday 
these are real problems that do occur martinez said to 
our knowledge theres not another state in the union that has a 
bill of this comprehensive nature dealing with oil spills 
i believe that others will begin to follow suit for the same 
reasons we did they have coastlines to protect and the only way 
to protect is to be able to immediately respond he said 
the legislation which is a compromise with oil shippers and 
retailers requires vessels and terminals to produce detailed 
spillresponse plans and terminals to buy equipment to quickly 
contain a spill 
only certified pilots or deputy pilots will be allowed to move 
large ships in florida waters which extend 3 miles into the 
atlantic ocean and 10 miles into the gulf which is shallower 
closer to shore 
fines of up to 25000 could be assessed for violations 
where oil and other potential pollutants are loaded and unloaded 
in large quantities terminal operators will have to use booms to 
seal off surrounding waters to contain any spills 
liability limits for spill damage and cleanup costs for 
transporters and cargo owners jump to 50 million from 14 million 
the state would have to go to court to collect any of that money 
in addition if future oil drilling is approved off floridas 
coast the cap on a state fund to pay for spill cleanups would 
double to 100 million using an existing 2centsabarrel excise 
tax on oil and other potential pollutants 
if a major spill depletes the fund now at 32 million the 
governor and cabinet could increase the tax to 10 cents until the 
fund is replenished 
environmentalists generally praised the law as a positive first 
step in protecting the state from oil spills but said more must be 
done 
in particular the financial limits on cleanup liability for oil 
companies and shippers should be removed said ann whitfield of the 
florida public interest research group citing the 2 billion cost 
of the valdez spill 
this is a dramatic improvement but it still maintains the 
principle that the oil industry should be protected from cleanup 
costs whitfield said if they were not protected it would be 
a financial incentive for them to have the safety equipment to do 
the job 
although the law is likely to raise oil companies costs of 
doing business in florida martinez cited the size of the states 
market 
you have no costs if you do it right the governor added 
the cost only comes if you dont take the proper precautions

americans are becoming more concerned that 
businesses and the government are invading their privacy by asking 
too many questions and sharing the information with others a poll 
released monday said 
seventyone percent of those surveyed by louis harris amp 
associates believe consumers have lost all control over how 
companies use information about them and circulate it to other 
firms the poll said 
the poll was commissioned by equifax an atlantabased 
corporation that provides clients with credit insurance and 
marketing information about potential customers 
the poll said that 79 percent of the public is either very 
concerned or somewhat concerned about threats to their personal 
privacy compared with 77 percent in a 1983 harris survey and 64 
percent in 1978 in 1970 only 34 percent said they were concerned 
about privacy issues 
thirty percent said they had decided against applying for a job 
credit or insurance because they didnt want to provide certain 
kinds of information about themselves the survey said 
but 78 percent said they would be upset if they couldnt get 
credit based on their record of paying bills the survey said 
humphrey taylor president of louis harris said the poll sends 
a warning to private business adding it would be a serious 
mistake for business to ignore the high and growing levels of 
concern that we are reporting today 
most americans are willing to give personal information when 
they believe it will be used in ways they consider proper such as 
employers checking whether a job applicant has a criminal record 
and credit card companies checking a persons credit history the 
poll said 
eightythree percent of the respondents said employers should be 
allowed to require drug tests for job applicants 
sixtynine percent said phone companies should be allowed to 
offer caller id which displays the phone number of an incoming 
call if customers can block their number from being shown 
the random telephone poll included 2254 interviews in january 
and february and an additional 2253 interviews in april with 
about half of the first group of people being reinterviewed the 
margin of error was plus or minus 2 percent

mystery fans take heart there may yet be a 
solution to the case of the missing desk 
for the time being though followers of this enduring boston 
mystery are going to have to settle for clues that only raise more 
questions did the mayor do it which mayor and whose desk is it 
anyway 
heres the lowdown the ornate handcarved mahogany desk 
supposedly belonged to legendary fourterm mayor james michael 
curley who left office in 1949 but the furniture disappeared when 
mayor kevin white left office in 1984 
now mayor raymond flynn wants it back and white says he may be 
able to find it but he says it wasnt curleys desk to begin with 
got it 
the desk has become something of a cause celebre in boston 
where it has been rumored to be hidden in whites beacon hill 
townhouse his cape cod summer home with his relatives in a 
courthouse basement or in an office building near city hall 
the suffolk county district attorneys office has investigated 
and found nothing a boston radio state has offered an expensepaid 
trip to ireland for its recovery 
still no desk 
in a television interview sunday white revived the mystery 
when asked him about the desk he said gee i can only blush at 
that i dont know as god is my judge where the curley desk is 
and anyway he said the desk was originally his not curleys 
curley served four nonconsecutive terms between 1914 and 1949 
white who served four consecutive terms from 196884 said an 
aide told him before he left office that somebody thinks thats 
the curley desk and flynn wants it youd better leave it 
and i said it isnt the curley desk flynn cant have it i 
want it and thats the end of that 
white said he went on vacation and the desk disappeared and 
now i dont know where it is but i can find it he said 
white said he doesnt know what to do with the desk once he 
finds it 
the question is do i produce the curley desk that i know is 
not the curley desk and let them believe it or do i refuse out of 
obstinacy to give them the desk they think is the curley desk 
which i know it isnt 
but flynn said he believes white knows where the desk is hidden 
and that it indeed belonged to curley 
its pretty obvious james michael curley had a desk said 
flynn there are pictures of him sitting behind it its 
legendary prominent people appeared in the mayors office

marion barry has made a firm decision to 
abandon his reelection plans but has put off an announcement for 
several days in an angry reaction to pressure from jesse jackson 
and others sources close to the mayor said monday 
barry had planned to make his decision public monday night in 
hopes of restarting stalled plea bargain talks as jury selection 
continued in his drug possession and perjury trial the sources 
said 
however a scheduled interview on a local television program was 
canceled barry press spokeswoman cheryl crowell said 
more meetings with campaign officials are in the planning 
stages but the mayor is now expected to announce his decision 
later this week one barry aide said 
the embattled mayor met with about a dozen top advisers and 
fundraisers sunday night to discuss his political future 
the aide who attended the meeting and described it only on 
condition of anonymity said barry was clear in telling the group 
he would not seek a fourth term 
he was resolute as firm as he could be said the aide 
with him he can always change his mind but hes pretty far down 
the road 
barry is delaying making the announcement because of pressure 
from jackson from district delegate walter fauntroy who is a 
candidate to succeed barry as mayor and from others who have 
urged him publicly to drop out of the race the sources said 
there have been some intrusive parties jesse and others 
one source said the man wants to act on his own without seeming 
to be pushed around 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug 
use 
plea discussions which started more than two weeks ago broke 
down last week with us attorney jay b stephens insisting that 
barry plead guilty to a felony charge and the mayor willing to 
consider only a misdemeanor plea sources familiar with the 
situation have said 
the talks have not revolved around barrys reelection plans 
the sources said judy smith a spokeswoman for stephens was not 
immediately available for comment 
a guilty plea to any of the perjury charges probably would 
result in barry drawing a prison term under federal sentencing 
guidelines in that event he could not continue to hold office or 
run for reelection 
sources close to jackson said he is miffed that the mayor has 
failed to announce his decision not to seek reelection after 
telling the civil rights leader first that he would make the 
announcement friday and then that he would reveal his plans monday 
jackson has said publicly that he urged barry to drop his bid 
for the mayors chair and seek a plea agreement in order to spare 
the city the pain of a drawnout trial jackson also predicted last 
week that barry would make the announcement soon 
jackson was traveling and not immediately available to comment 
meanwhile 10 prospective jurors were added to the jury pool 
monday bringing the total number of potential jurors to 58 
excused from jury duty was a woman who said she knows a barry 
bodyguard james stays 
the woman said she had asked stays whether the mayor used drugs 
and stays told her no the bodyguard is on the list of witnesses 
the mayor might call in his defense 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson questioned 
whether the woman would be able to consider stays testimony fairly 
and impartially given the fact that she said she has known the 
bodyguard for several years and speaks to him frequently 
another prospective juror a man said the barry case has left 
an impression of sleaze that has rubbed off on everyone 
barry spent the day in court and bantered with reporters as he 
left the courthouse but did not respond to questions about whether 
he intended to announce he would not seek reelection

the united states and mexico took a first step 
monday toward negotiating a free trade pact that a white house 
official said could one day lead to a single north american market 
president bush and mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
agreed at a private dinner sunday night to have their trade 
officials begin preparations for the formal talks bush spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
the presidents agreed that the greatest possible mutual 
benefit would derive from an agreement that entails gradual and 
comprehensive elimination of trade barriers fitzwater said 
he said preparatory work by us trade representative carla 
hills and jaime puche mexicos minister of commerce and industrial 
development would be done between now and december when the two 
presidents will meet again 
that session is tentatively scheduled for monterrey mexico 
salinas told us business leaders that the most important 
immediate result of a usmexican freetrade agreement will be 
to increase trade and investment flows between both nations 
we need our exports to have stable secure access to the us 
market he said in remarks prepared for delivery to the business 
round table in exchange salinas said mexico will provide new 
markets for us goods and new investment opportunities for 
american businesses 
mexico does not want to be late for the worlds appointment 
with the 21st century salinas added 
the two countries will seek a pact that will improve and 
expand the flow of goods services and investment between the 
united states and mexico fitzwater said 
he said changes in immigration and emigration laws were not 
envisioned 
the united states signed a freetrade pact with canada in 1988 
under which all tariffs and other trade barriers are being 
eliminated by the year 2000 
in his 1988 campaign bush proposed a single north american 
trade zone a unified market of 335 million people without 
trade barriers 
bush still advocates such an approach and it is anticipated 
that would be an end result of a trade agreement with mexico 
fitzwater said however he noted a separate freetrade pact would 
also have to be struck between mexico and canada 
bush called canadian prime minister brian mulroney on sunday 
night to tell him of the developments fitzwater said mulroney 
was supportive the spokesman added 
bush promised the canadian leader to maintain a liaison and 
consultations as we go through the process the spokesman said 
such a pact would require congressional approval before formal 
negotiations could commence fitzwater said the administration 
envisioned sending the same general kind of legislation to congress 
that set up the uscanada talks 
that measure spelled out a timetable and required congress to 
put the final agreement on a fast track to keep it from getting 
bogged down 
even so negotiations on the uscanadian pact took nearly four 
years 
fitzwater said bush and salinas see free trade as a powerful 
engine for economic development 
in addition to eliminating tariffs fitzwater said a freetrade 
agreement would also have as a goal doing away with or the 
fullest possible reduction of other barriers to trade the 
spokesman cited import quotas licenses and technical barriers 
salinas in washington also met monday with secretary of state 
james a baker iii and members of congress he was to meet on 
tuesday with vice president dan quayle 
although the united states has pressed for free trade between 
the two nations salinas a harvardeducated economist initially 
was cool to the idea however more recently he has suggested that 
an economic recovery in mexico will not be possible without it 
his change of heart occurred after mexican efforts to seek 
foreign investment from europe fell far short of expectations 
mexico is the united states third largest trading partner after 
canada and japan with twoway trade of 52 billion last year 
the united states shipped 2497 billion worth of exports into 
mexico in 1989 and imported 2719 billion in mexican goods for a 
us trade deficit with mexico of 22 billion 
winning congressional agreement on an elimination of all trade 
barriers with mexico could prove more difficult than getting 
passage of the canadian pact 
the aflcio has voiced skepticism about such an arrangement 
suggesting that a freetrade pact could cost jobs in the united 
states once tariffs were removed on mexican products made by 
lowpaid mexican workers 
the jobs issue is a difficult one fitzwater said its 
one both sides are aware of we want an agreement that is 
beneficial to both sides both in terms of investment as well as 
jobs and labor markets 
salinas in his speech called unfounded concerns by us 
labor of job losses 
to assume that the creation of new jobs in mexico will be 
attained at the expense of the american worker is to ignore 
mexicos enormous potential as a market for united states exports 
and the complementarity of our economies he said

more effective and consistent regulation is 
needed to ensure the safety of cosmetics that do more than cleanse 
and beautify a house subcommittee chairman said monday 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the house small business 
subcommittee on regulation said too many products that meet the 
definitions for both cosmetics and drugs slip through regulatory 
cracks in current law 
this group of cosmeceuticals including antiwrinkle and 
antiaging creams moisturizers astringents and skin firmers are 
regulated on the basis of marketing claims 
wyden released a congressional research service report that he 
said shows two products with exactly the same ingredients can 
fall under entirely different regulations based on the fancy 
wording of smart advertisers 
current law defines a cosmetic as something that is used to 
clean and beautify a drug under the law is something used to 
diagnose cure treat prevent disease or alter the structure or 
function of the body 
while drugs must undergo safety and effectiveness testing before 
they can be marketed cosmetics are the least regulated articles 
under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the report said 
in deciding whether a product is a cosmetic or a drug the fda 
looks at intended use as reflected in the manufacturers 
claims for the product the report said 
for example a skin lotion that claims to physiologically get 
rid of wrinkles is classified as a drug and must be safety tested 
however if the same lotion claimed only to beautify the skin it 
would be considered a cosmetic and free of regulation if it claims 
to be a sun screen it is a drug 
wyden said the ambiguity in the current law which dates to 
1938 needs to be corrected to ensure that all cosmetics are safe 
the report offered several legislative options to clarify the 
classification of drugs and cosmetics 
wyden will use it to help draft legislation providing for 
minimal regulation of the 18 billion a year cosmetics industry 
provisions are expected to include registration of manufacturers 
and requirements that they submit injury and testing reports to the 
food and drug administration a spokeswoman for the congressman 
said 
fda officials were reviewing the report

one year after a wildcat miners strike 
erupted in the appalachian coal fields calm reigns above and below 
ground 
miners angry about stalled settlement talks between the pittston 
co and workers taking part in a sanctioned strike began walking 
off the job a year ago tuesday 
the wildcat strike lasted about six weeks and idled 46000 
miners 
its the closest ive come to seeing what they call 
spontaneous uprisings in poland or czechoslovakia said umw 
spokesman john duray in washington dc one day everythings 
peaceful and the next day everything starts 
within 10 days the sympathy strike that began in southern west 
virginia had spread to 10 states united mine workers officials 
ultimately ordered a coolingoff period and miners returned to work 
other states affected were indiana illinois pennsylvania 
alabama ohio kentucky virginia missouri and tennessee 
coal company officials are reluctant to talk about the wildcat 
strike but duray said there is one obvious lesson for both 
management and labor 
considering the nature of these walkouts id say solidarity 
is alive and well in the united mine workers duray said 
the pittston strike which idled about 1700 union miners in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky began april 5 1989 and was 
settled on new years day the miners went back to work in february 
most of the legal disputes stemming from the pittston strike 
have been settled but the same cant be said about the lawsuits 
and national labor relations board complaints filed because of the 
wildcat strike 
union officials said they did not authorize the wildcat action 
but have reached a tentative settlement with the nlrb on hundreds 
of coal company complaints alleging that the union organized the 
walkouts in a bid to pressure pittston 
the union says it wont release details of the settlement until 
it is completed 
dozens of lawsuits filed by coal companies seeking to recover 
income lost because of the wildcat strike are pending 
the walkout was the first major wildcat strike by miners since 
the late 1970s when such actions could be counted on to bring 
production to a halt often because of issues outside the coal 
companies control 
you had in west virginia in the 1970s strikes over the 
textbooks used in the schools strikes over gasoline lines all 
kinds of things happened duray said 
in one incident miners at a western pennsylvania mine walked 
off the job for two days because of a report that a worm had been 
found in a water cooler 
union president rich trumka has softened some of the unions 
oldtime militancy favoring selective strikes over wildcat walkouts 
and persuading members to abandon their onceironclad policy of 
no contract no work

nelson mandela told thousands of 
cheering supporters monday that the african national congress not 
the south african government deserves sole credit for initiating 
peace talks 
he also urged continued pressure for economic sanctions as long 
as apartheid exists in south africa 
sanctions were introduced at the insistence of the african 
national congress for the purpose of removing apartheid in all its 
forms mandela said 
the idea was to ensure all people of south africa black and 
white are able to determine their own affairs to ensure a 
nonracial democratic and united south africa we are still very 
far from that 
mandela deputy leader of the anc spoke to about 4000 people 
outside the headquarters of the opposition west german social 
democratic party which invited him to visit he stopped in the 
west german capital on a tour of europe and north america to argue 
against lifting of sanctions against south africa 
britain and some other countries have said president fw de 
klerk should be rewarded for his steps toward ending south africas 
racial strife including freeing mandela after 28 years in jail 
legalizing the black nationalist movement and lifting the state of 
emergency in three of the four provinces 
mandela 71 said de klerk should be admired for having the 
courage to say the governments previous position was wrong but 
that it was anc campaigning and economic sanctions that finally 
brought the government to peace talks 
the credit for the discussions that are now going on in south 
africa in the search of peace comes to the african national 
congress and the african national congress alone the black 
leader said 
mandela criticized countries that may be considering lifting 
sanctions saying they were not thinking of south africa as a 
whole but only of the white minority 
one of the most dangerous tendencies in the world is people 
who always think in terms of their flesh and blood when theyre 
dealing with problems those who call for the lifting of sanctions 
are making precisely that mistake mandela said 
he said the reality in south africa was that apartheid was 
still in place 
there are blacks who have no rights there are whites who 
enjoy all the basic human rights 
the european economic community to which west germany belongs 
agreed on nonbinding measures against south africa in 1986 
banning imports of iron steel and gold coins and banning new 
investments in south africa 
britain unilaterally lifted its ban on new investments in south 
africa in february the sanctions issue is expected to come up at a 
meeting next week in luxembourg of the 12 eec foreign ministers 
mandela and his wife winnie arrived in bonn sunday night 
on tuesday mandela will meet with chancellor helmut kohl and 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
at a dinner monday for mandela former west german chancellor 
willy brandt called mandela the truly legitimate spokesman for 
the majority of south africas population 
but he noted nelson mandela viewed by many of us as the 
future south african president in his own land still has no voting 
right he cannot freely choose his apartment not all public 
facilities are available to him 
when he has the same rights as president de klerk then the 
time will have come to introduce a new era of economic 
cooperation

president bush met with an east german prime 
minister for the first time monday as the white house cited 
considerable progress toward persuading moscow to accept a 
united germany in nato 
but prime minister lothar de maiziere said later that he 
emphasized to bush the nature of nato must be significantly 
changed in order to meet the soviet unions security concerns 
i made clear to him what psychological difficulties this would 
signify de maiziere told german reporters as he visited the 
lincoln memorial after his oval office meeting at the white house 
he added he believes nato membership for a united germany is 
only thinkable if a treaty clearly defines the status of soviet 
troops now stationed in east germany 
the east german prime minister said it remains open whether such 
a treaty should be between nato and the warsaw pact or between a 
united germany and the soviet union 
de maiziere said bush insisted such a question would have to be 
resolved by the countries negotiating the unification of east and 
west germany 
the white house said in a statement that bush and de maiziere 
agreed a united germany should enjoy full sovereignty from the 
time of its unification with no discriminatory constraints on its 
sovereignty and that germany should be free to choose its own 
alliance arrangements 
the two leaders met in the oval office after posing for 
photographs on the steps overlooking the white house rose garden 
they held expanded talks in the cabinet room and lunched in the 
family quarters of the white house 
he was so emotional about it he had never been here bush 
told white house visitors later describing his meeting with de 
maiziere as wonderful 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush stressed his 
belief that a united germanys membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization is essential for european security and will 
pose no threat to the soviet union 
the president also said negotiations will result in an end to 
the rights held in the two germanys by the four main victors of 
world war ii the united states france britain and the soviet 
union 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has said he is unwilling 
to accept continued german membership in nato on grounds it is a 
usled antisoviet military alliance he wants a united germany 
to hold membership in the warsaw pact as well as nato 
but fitzwater said gorbachevs summit meeting with bush early 
this month and later assurances offered by secretary of state 
james a baker iii may be helping change gorbachevs mind 
i think we feel considerable progress has been made 
fitzwater said 
its clear that this is going to be a gradual process i 
cant report any conclusion to the matter but we do feel progress 
is going to be made he said 
de maiziere holds the distinction of being the first and 
probably the last prime minister of the german democratic 
republic to be invited to the white house 
the two german states are ready to form a monetary union next 
month on a basis that will provide large subsidies from prosperous 
west germany for the economically struggling and cashpoor east 
a german national election could be held as early as next 
january to end the division imposed after the world war ii defeat 
of nazi germany 
bush who had dinner friday night with visiting west german 
chancellor helmut kohl anticipated de maizieres visit as just 
one more step that demonstrates the magnificent changes that have 
taken place over the past year and a half 
de maiziere 50 is chairman of the east german christian 
democratic union he was responsible for church affairs in the 
government of hans modrow the last communist leader 
in addition to meeting with bush and baker de maiziere planned 
to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier in arlington 
national cemetery meet the president of the us holocaust 
memorial council and deliver a lecture at georgetown universitys 
foreign service school 
on tuesday he will meet with senators and members of the house 
and speak at the national press club he will then return to new 
york for a meeting with un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar before returning to east berlin

prime minister yitzhak shamir won narrow 
parliamentary approval monday for one of the most rightwing 
governments in israels 42year history gaining 62 votes in the 
120seat knesset 
in presenting his 19member cabinet shamir pledged to seek 
peace but promised expanded jewish settlments a pledge likely to 
raise tensions with washington and the arabs 
it is the first government fully in control of the rightwing 
likud bloc since 1984 it takes over at a time of new crisis in the 
mideast with iraqi president saddam hussein issuing threats 
against israel and palestinians asking for escalation of the 
insurrection in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
mondays vote came after a sixhour debate liberal lawmakers 
accused likud of using bribery to forge the coalition with nine 
small farright and religious parties the rival labor party said 
the new government cannot bring peace 
shamir called the criticisms pitiful and asked israelis to 
make their no 1 task the absorption of thousands of soviet jewish 
immigrants 
this is the mission that will be the focus of government 
activity and after it all the rest strengthening peace advancing 
toward peace economy and social problems he told reporters 
after the balloting 
the vote was 62 for the government 57 against with one 
abstention 
it installed israels 24th government since the states founding 
on may 15 1948 
shamir 74 is serving as premier for the fourth time he first 
got the job in 1983 when likud founder menachem begin stepped down 
that rightwing government fell later that year but shamir 
stayed in power until the 1984 elections since then close 
elections have forced likud and the leftofcenter labor party into 
powersharing coalitions 
the political bickering that accompanied the new governments 
birth raised questions about whether the coalition of diverse 
factions could survive until the 1992 scheduled election 
shamir and his likud allies spent the day warding off threats of 
defection and it was uncertain if the knesset or parliament 
would back the new government until the vote was cast 
the ultraorthodox shas party threatened to pull out over a 
police investigation of alleged fraud by one of its leaders and 
four parliament members warned they would abstain or vote no 
because they did not get ministerial positions 
david levy a leading likud figure and the foreign minister 
walked out of a meeting with shamir because he was only one of two 
deputy premiers and not shamirs undisputed successor 
but in the end all the defection threats proved empty as shamir 
got the 62 votes he forecast when he announced the government last 
friday 
demonstrators gathered outside the knesset to demand political 
reform shouting slogans about concessions made to bring 
ultraorthodox parties into the govermennt 
amnon rubinstein of the liberal shinui party said the bargaining 
amounted to bribery by offering jobs to defectors from labor 
former defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor compared the new 
cabinet to begins rightwing government elected in 1981 that 
started the lebanon war 
this is a narrow government narrow in its shoulders and 
horizons a government that cannot answer the great challenges and 
decrease the great dangers he said 
shamir pledged he would continue to seek dialogue with 
palestinians and a deeper involvement of egypt in peace efforts 
but he said the arab hatred toward us has not expired the 
problem is the rejection of the very existence of israel 
as he spoke of his governments obligation to seek peace shamir 
was interrupted by jeering from an israeli arab knesset member 
abdul wahab daroushe he shouted back at daroushe shut up and 
let me speak 
another arab parliament member tewfik toubi said it was a 
black day because shamirs government relied for support on a 
twomember faction called moledat or homeland which seeks to 
expel all arabs from israelheld territory 
shamir also got into shouting with labor party leader shimon 
peres who blamed the prime minister for blocking peace moves and 
said his new government was dangerous for israel 
the government proposed today is a shaky one built on many 
legs of clay peres said its composition its guidelines are 
not bringing peace it has no ability to change no joy of hope it 
is a sad government for its members and a sorrowful government for 
israel 
shamirs last government an uneasy alliance between likud and 
labor collapsed march 15 over labors demands that israel accept a 
us proposal for opening peace talks with palestinians 
the policy guidelines of shamirs new government reject talks 
with the palestine liberation organization and the founding of a 
palestinian state and he made clear he had no intention of giving 
up the west bank and gaza strip where palestinians hope to create 
their state 
the plobacked leaders of the 30monthold palestinian uprising 
gave their views of shamirs government in a leaflet that called 
the new coalition a terrorist government and urged escalating 
the revolt against occupation 
shamir continued to hint at a greater israel including the 
occupied territories although such statements have strained 
relations with the united states 
before agreeing to provide israel with 400 million in loan 
guarantees to help settle a flood of soviet jewish immigrants the 
united states has asked for assurances they will not be moved to 
occupied land us policy oppposes all settlements as obstacles to 
peace 
but shamir has named former defense minister ariel sharon an 
outspoken advocate of jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories as housing minister and head of a cabinet committee 
on the soviet immigration

the courage to get through his ordeal 
mann was shot down six times by nazi forces as a royal air force

irans late revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini said rushdie blasphemed islam in the novel and placed 
rushdie under a death order in february 1989

action against rushdie

palestinian leaders warned monday that israels 
new rightwing government will be more prone to violence and one 
predicted it will sink israelis and palestinians in a sea of 
blood 
in the occupied west bank monday israeli troops stormed the 
hideout of a suspected palestinian hit squad in nablus killing one 
arab and wounding three the army said another 17 were caught 
also monday underground leaders of the palestinian uprising 
urged activists to respond to the new rightist government of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir by stepping up attacks on israeli soldiers 
and jewish settlers in the occupied lands 
in a leaflet the proplo underground leaders urged palestinians 
to escalate the struggle and burn the ground under the feet of 
the occupation army and the settlers 
the harsh reaction came as parliament approved shamirs 
government which has vowed to crush the 30monthold rebellion and 
also expand jewish settlement in the occupied lands 
shamir has also rejected us proposals for a preliminary 
dialogue between israelis and palestinians in cairo the plo and 
prominent palestinians in the occupied lands support such an idea 
this government is an obstacle to the peace process saeed 
kenaan a proplo businessman in nablus said in a telephone 
interview monday 
therefore a catastrophe will take place in the region and i 
hold the israeli government and the us government responsible for 
all the repercussions that will arise he said 
faisal husseini a prominent plo leader who has been mentioned 
as a potential peace negotiator agreed 
this is a government of war and i think the decisions of such 
a government will be decisions of war husseini said 
palestinians warned that violence would escalate if shamir made 
good on his threats to crack down on the uprising 
this government will sink palestinians and israelis into a sea 
of blood said saeb erakat a proplo professor and journalist 
an army official said the palestinians targeted in the nablus 
raid were involved in killing several suspected arab collaborators 
and firing on israeli soldiers 
the group was hiding in a twolevel structure in nablus crowded 
market area the official said troops broke in from the front and 
back killing one arab and wounding three he said a homemade 
weapon and a pistol were seized 
among the detainees were eight wanted men the army official 
said he insisted on anonymity 
arab reporters identified the slain palestinian as 19yearold 
jamal akliek 19 and said he was shot in the head and the hand 
they said akliek was an activist in the fatah faction of plo leader 
yasser arafat and was part of a squad known locally as the 
general security group 
the death raised to 717 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli troops and civilians since the start of the uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip in december 1987 fortyfive

expression and predicted that a federal judges ruling that the 
groups album as nasty as they want to be contained obscene 
material would be overturned 
in an apparent effort to calm tensions the broward county 
sheriffs office and 2 live crew arranged monday to serve a court 
appearance notice through the groups attorney instead of directly 
on band member mark ross sought on misdemeanor obscenity charges 
the charges arose from a concert early sunday at which the group 
performed the banned material 
band leader luther campbell and member christopher wongwon were 
arrested shortly after the concert and released on 100 bond each 
a fourth member initially was sought but investigators dropped that 
warrant after deciding they had insufficient evidence to charge 
him said sheriff nick navarro 
martinez who has publicly attacked 2 live crew during his 
campaign for reelection applauded the crackdown but insisted he 
did not order it 
communities have the right to set a standard i think this is 
a form of audio pornography martinez said a lot of the music 
is geared to the abuse of women 
he dismissed arguments that the arrests were politically 
motivated and possibly violated the first amendment noting that 
us district judge jose gonzalez had upheld the constitutionality 
of browards ban on obscenity in ruling last week that the album 
contained obscene and illegal material 
the groups attorney bruce rogow said he filed an appeal to 
gonzalezs decision monday with the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta 
there is a violation of the law the governor said in 
defending the arrests i dont think there ought to be any 
consideration because you happen to be well known and happen to 
earn a lot of money 
gonzalez ruling led to fridays arrest of a broward county 
record store owner after he sold record and tape versions of the 
album to an undercover agent 
navarro denied he had ordered the musicians arrested because of 
obscenities directed toward him by campbell and the crowd at 
sundays concert 
i take no offense to any of that he said let em go for 
it 
entertainment attorneys said the crackdown would most intimidate 
large record companies with connections to governmentregulated 
broadcast media making them think twice before signing or 
promoting certain artists 
they have no choice said peter thall whose new york firm 
represents foreigner and other music groups this kind of 
incident generates fear in any company that has to go before 
licensing agencies 
thall also said the arrests smacked of racism 
jay topkis a new york attorney who successfully beat efforts to 
ban dh lawrences erotic book lady chatterleys lover 25 
years ago said the 2 live crew ban seemed to be part of an 
increasing effort nationwide to restrict free speech he cited 
recent controversy over exhibits of explicit photographs by the 
late robert mapplethorpe 
some people are making it their business to try to suppress 
ideas topkis said the idea that judges and juries are going 
to be deciding that rock compositions are obscene seems to me to be 
an invitation to national muzzling

david levy israels new foreign minister 
worked his way from a ditchdigger to one of the highestranking 
posts ever held by a north african immigrant 
a fiery orator the moroccanborn levy 52 began his political 
career in the ranks of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc as a labor union boss championing the causes of the 
disadvantaged 
he advanced quickly in the party and is regarded by some as a 
political opportunist who might compromise ideology in his drive to 
succeed shamir as prime minister 
although his appointment is welcomed as a confirmation of the 
integration israels founding fathers espoused levy has little 
experience in foreign policy 
most criticized is levys scant knowledge of english which 
could hamper communication with the united states on which israel 
relies for political support and about 3 billion in annual aid 
but unlike most of his predecessors levy is fluent in arabic 
levy has a reputation as a hardliner and was one of the party 
rebels who forced shamir to accept crippling conditions to his 
initiative to hold elections in the occupied territories 
but insiders suggest levys hardline had less to do with 
ideology than with his desire to oust the polishborn shamir as 
likud leader 
in 1982 he led opposition within the likud government to 
israels protracted threeyear war in lebanon and many of the 
military moves of his party rival ariel sharon who as defense 
minister was the architect of the lebanon war 
at a news conference this week levy said his first task as 
foreign minister would be to prevent deterioration and to 
improve israels strained ties with the united states 
levys early years were immersed in the poverty that was typical 
of many of the 600000 jews from arab lands or sephardim who 
settled in israel in the 1950s and 60s 
the immigrants and their offspring now comprise more than 60 
percent of israels 45 million citizens and constitute a 
disproportionately large number of the nations poor 
in his biography levy is quoted throughout as being consumed 
with anger and resentment toward the israeli establishment because 
of the poverty and neglect he experienced in beit shean a northern 
town where he lived after immigrating at age 20 in 1957 
for israels first 30 years israel was governed by the 
centerleft labor party which was dominated by european jews or 
ashkenazim 
why do they take people who come with good will and a lot of 
love for the land of israel and grind it into sand biographer 
aryeh avinery quotes levy as saying 
after spending some time unemployed levy found work as a 
ditchdigger and construction worker 
he was first elected to the knesset or parliament at age 32 in 
1969 he won his first cabinet seat as immigration minister in 
1977 and has served as housing minister since 1979

a newly renovated museum displaying more than 
400 historical objects relating to abraham lincolns assassination 
was dedicated monday at fords thequals 
boston ap cleanup crews watched anxiously monday as choppy 
seas and stiff winds delayed efforts to unload thousands of gallons 
of fuel that threatened to spill from the torn hull of the cruise 
ship bermuda star 
the 617foot vessel was freed sunday night from a rocky ledge 
off cape cod almost 13 hours after it strayed too close to shore 
and ran aground in dense fog 
divers found a 90by2foot tear on the ships bottom after it 
dropped anchor about 3 miles from the ledge in buzzards bay the 
rip exposed four tanks holding more than 110000 gallons of fuel 
oil the coast guard said 
about 1500 gallons of fuel leaked before a containment boom was 
put around the ship and the tear left the potential for more oil 
to spill the coast guard said 
up to 1000 gallons of fuel washed ashore at naushon island in 
buzzards bay on monday coast guard cmdr larry doyle told an 
afternoon news conference in providence ri 
the oil splashed the largely unpopulated island with a gooey 
swath up to 4 feet wide along a fivemile stretch of shoreline 
doyle said 
another 100000 gallons of what doyle described as thick 
heavy dense oil may leak into the sea 
it has the potential to be a medium spill doyle said 
doyle said the coast guard believed it was more prudent to wait 
for the weather to clear than to risk the safety of the repair 
crews 
im not in any rush to hurry through that he said the 
vessel is stable its safe 
cleanup of naushon island which lies off the tip of woods hole 
west of the cape cod canal entrance was expected to begin tuesday 
morning doyle said water pressing against the ship kept the oil 
inside while anchored the coast guard said plans to tow the ship 
to a dry dock in new york had to be scrapped until the holes could 
be patched and the fuel unloaded 
if you moved the ship now the inertia of the sea would take 
away the balancing effect we have and it would suck the oil right 
out of the tear in the ship said steve aitkins a coast guard 
spokesman in boston 
but rain and fog coupled with winds of 15 to 30 mph and 
2to4foot waves threatened efforts to skim off the spilled fuel 
and unload the rest 
its kind of a catch22 the weather can help you as much as 
it can hinder you said randy krahn a coast guard petty officer 
in providence ri the rain can help break up the oil but too 
much makes the cleanup harder 
forecasters predicted the weather would get worse before it got 
better possibly on tuesday morning 
aitkins said the coast guards atlantic area strike team in 
mobile ala has been notified to be ready to move if the oil 
starts to leak and local cleanup crews could not contain it 
the vessel on a cruise from new york to nova scotia went 
aground in fog sunday morning the more than 1060 passengers and 
some crew members were ferried to new bedford in the evening and 
taken by bus to hotels in boston 
there was a sudden stop and then a metallic noise then 
immediately there was an oily smell we went out on deck and we 
could see the oil coming out on the water said passenger paul 
kelly of columbia sc 
tests for drugs and alcohol were performed on key members of the 
crew but the results were not immediately available the coast 
guard said 
david roddy senior vice president of bermuda star line cruises 
in teaneck nj described the ships captain hans lewing as 
an excellent popular captain with 20 years of shipping 
experience 
lewing had been with the company for three years and had a good 
record roddy said 
passengers who had their sevenday excursion abruptly ended 
would be offered another week or 10day cruise or a refund roddy 
said the company also would pay their airfare to return home from 
boston he said

flags flew at halfstaff and festivities were 
canceled monday in the soviet republic of kirghizia to mourn the 
116 people killed in a week of ethnic clashes in central asia the 
tass news agency reported 
the official news agency and soviet television said the 
situation in central asia had calmed following clashes between 
uzbeks and kirghiz that broke out after a land dispute 
a trend toward the stabilization of the situation in the 
republics southern region has become apparent tass said 
quoting the republics interior ministry 
in osh a city near kirghizias border with uzbekistan shops 
reopened and public transport was returning to normal tass said 
the news agency said 116 people died 468 were wounded and at 
least 500 acts of arson were committed in the week of violence 
in memory of the dead tass said flags are flying at 
halfmast and all recreational and entertainment activities have 
been suspended 
kirghizias capital of frunze was calm monday as television and 
radio broadcast somber music in memory of the dead said albert 
bogdanov a journalist with the kirtag news agency 
on sunday students trying to organize rallies in frunzes main 
square were turned back by interior ministry troops and police 
said ivan pavlov a party official in the capital 
rallies in frunze last week turned into demonstrations against 
the republics leaders with thousands of students demanding their 
resignations and calling on residents to go to osh and join the 
battle against the uzbeks 
officials from the communist party and the government visited 
student and worker dormitories sunday morning to talk them out of 
holding rallies pavlov said 
armored personnel carriers monday continued to patrol the main 
streets of frunze in districts where trouble had broken out 
earlier bogdanov said in a telephone interview 
the bloodshed was the latest ethnic violence to trouble the 
government of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev nationalities 
in various republics have used the looser atmosphere under 
gorbachevs reform initiatives to vent their frustrations over 
political and economic woes 
the violence started when uzbeks who make up onethird of the 
population discovered that kirghiz were being given land for 
housing which is critically short in the densely populated and 
poor regions of central asia 
the fighting spread to districts around osh and thousands of 
troops were sent in to reinforce the local police soviet troops 
sealed off the border to prevent thousands of uzbeks from crossing 
into kirghizia to join the battle

on the eve of a critical vote among southern 
baptist leaders moderates and fundamentalists both threatened to 
back away from the deeply divided church if they lose 
to say this is an important convention is an understatement 
said the rev daniel vestal the moderate standardbearer for the 
churchs presidency its a crucial convention 
the voting scheduled for tuesday afternoon will likely decide 
the future of the nations largest denomination which has 149 
million members the outcome of the socalled battle of new 
orleans is up in the air insiders said monday 
its going to be close said the rev paige patterson of 
dallas a chief fundamentalist strategist betting on baptists is 
always riskier than betting on the horses 
if moderates win he said i fear the wheels are going to come 
off meaning the fundamentalist camp might reduce denominational 
support they do not want to go back to funding that which to 
them is unconscionable he said in an interview 
vestal of the atlanta suburb of dunwoody ga said what he 
characterized as the ruthless and destructive system of 
enforced conformity by fundamentalists cannot continue without 
causing widespread nonparticipation by moderates 
however morris chapman of wichita falls texas the candidate 
of the controlling fundamentalist wing said the denomination had 
been saved from a drift leftward 
he urged that we make complete the course correction and 
return to belief in the inspired infallible inerrant word of 
god 
the belief that the bible is without error historically 
scientifically theologically and in other areas has been the 
fundamentalist rallying cry in gaining denominational control 
most southern baptists are conservative theologically and 
committed to the bible as the rule of faith but historically have 
insisted on allowing individuals some leeway in interpreting it 
some moderates including vestal espouse a fundamentalist 
literalistic view of scripture but contend room should be allowed 
for diverse views 
the churchs power lies in its presidency the presidents 
appointive power determines trustees of the denominations network 
of agencies seminaries and other institutions 
for 11 years fundamentalists have held the top office they 
have tightened requirements and questioned the beliefs of thousands 
of denominational staff workers including seminary professors 
the contest is viewed as the moderates last organized election 
effort in the foreseeable future 
there were thousands of delegates to the convention called 
messengers in town monday and the number was expected to 
surpass 30000 before tuesdays formal opening at the louisiana 
superdome 
the rev adrian rogers of memphis tenn a fundamentalist 
leader and past president told a pastors conference monday that 
he would reassess his participation in the denomination if the 
moderate wing wins 
it is better to be divided by truth than to be united in 
error rogers said 
our beloved denomination is fragmented carolyn weatherford 
crumpler of cincinnati who is backing vestal and who for 15 years 
headed the churchs influential womens missionary union told a 
womens meeting 
the wounded spirit of southern baptists needs to be lanced and 
opened to the healing air of gods grace she said

ariel sharon israels most charismatic hawk 
believes the jewish state must rely on military might rather than 
the art of diplomacy to ensure its survival 
the burly former defense minister and engineer of the 1982 
invasion of lebanon will become israels housing minister in prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs new government that received 
parliamentary approval monday 
in that post sharon will be in charge of coordinating the 
absorption of tens of thousands of soviet immigrants expected to 
arrive in the jewish state in the 1990s 
critics fear sharon could raise tensions between israel and the 
united states by channeling soviet immigrants into the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the us administration opposes moving soviet jews into the 
occupied territories which it calls an obstacle to peace 
sharon has remained mum about his plans 
i will only repeat that israel is a democratic state and 
citizens can live where they want he said sunday 
sharon 62 who has often followed his own path in politics 
recently angered washington with his active support of a jewish 
settlement in jerusalems christian quarter 
sharon would stroll over daily from his nearby apartment in the 
moslem quarter as a show of israels sovereignty over the disputed 
city 
he moved into the moslem quarter in december 1987 and his 
apartment has a permanent detachment of soldiers and paramilitary 
border police standing guard outside 
sharon has set his sights on succeeding shamir as prime minister 
and the two traded bitter insults a few months ago when sharon led 
a campaign to torpedo shamirs proposal for peace talks with the 
palestinians 
the hardline conditions sharon wanted to append to shamirs 
peace plan have all been adopted as part of the new governments 
guidelines 
but the israeliborn sharons attempts to become prime minister 
have been thwarted by his responsibility for the muchcriticized 
war in lebanon in which hundreds of israeli troops were killed 
sharon was forced to resign as defense minister in 1983 when an 
israeli inquiry commission found him indirectly responsible for the 
slayings of hundreds of palestinians by israelibacked lebanese 
forces in the sabra and chatilla refugee camps in beirut 
sharon often boasts about how he crushed arab unrest when he 
served as army commander in the gaza strip in 1971 and says it 
should be used as a model for suppressing the 30monthold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied lands 
but critics have charged that sharons ruthless 1971 campaign 
was against guerrilla cells and that the current uprising is a 
popular revolt consisting mainly of stoning attacks 
last year sharon called on the israeli government to 
liquidate plo chief yasser arafat

hundreds of us citizens returned to 
america on monday after fleeing wartorn liberia where rebels are 
trying to topple the government of president samuel k doe 
it feels wonderful it feels great to be back in the united 
states said the rev henry hungerpiller a 69yearold orangeburg 
native who has served as a missionary in liberia for 35 years 
the evacuees urged by the us government to leave the west 
african nation because of warfare on sunday flew from the capital 
of monrovia liberia to abidjan capital of neighboring ivory 
coast they transferred to an american trans air chartered flight 
and arrived at charleston international airport at 1225 pm edt 
at least 170 of the 349 passengers were children many of whom 
received stuffed animals from salvation army workers at the 
charleston airport 
many evacuees declined to talk to reporters apparently 
concerned about the effect on friends in liberia or their chances 
to return but those who did speak said fighting was intense and 
many appeared thankful to be out of the country 
most of the people in monrovia are very much afraid 
hungerpiller said we didnt see any fighting but they were 
getting closer and closer all the time 
hungerpiller worked at a bible school of about 600 students 12 
miles outside the capital until it was shuttered because of the 
fighting 
conditions in liberia are terrible there is fighting all 
over said solon de joachim an educator and businessman en route 
to new york with two sons and two daughters to meet his wife and 
five other children 
johnny connelly a 26yearold missionary from madison ga 
said basic necessities in liberia were in short supply before he 
fled with his wife janice and their 2yearold son josiah 
its very tense commodities are running short rice is 
disappearing and gas is disappearing connelly said 
the united states has been warning us for weeks to go and 
leave and now was about our last chance before the rebels come into 
monrovia he said 
state department spokesman jay rini said there are no plans for 
additional flights from liberia to charleston 
the evacuees were flown to charleston because local authorities 
have experience handling similiar situations rini said 
in 1983 american college students were evacuated to charleston 
following the us invasion of grenada and last spring military 
dependants from panama were evacuated through charleston 
the liberia evacuees were greeted at the airport by state 
department of social services workers whose job it was to make sure 
they had enough money funds to travel to their final destinations 
in the united states 
the department provides those who need financial help with 
federal loans spokeswoman norma anderson said 
in liberia on monday peace talks between government and rebel 
negotiators aimed at ending the civil war stalled as rebel 
officials had difficulty getting their negotiators to the site in 
neighboring sierra leone 
the 5monthold civil war aimed at ousting president doe has 
left more than 1000 dead

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter was sentenced to six months in prison monday by a judge 
who accused him of usurping the power of congress by lying about 
the irancontra affair 
the sentence imposed by us district judge harold h greene was 
the first prison term for any of the seven people convicted as a 
result of the affair 
greene said letting poindexter off without a prison term would 
be tantamount to a statement that a scheme to lie to and obstruct 
congress is of no great moment 
the judge delivered a stern lecture along with the sentence 
saying poindexter violated a principle fundamental to this 
constitutional republic that those elected by and responsible to 
the people shall make the important policy decisions 
their decisions may not be nullified by appointed officials 
who happen to be in positions that give them the ability to operate 
programs prohibited by law the judge said 
he said poindexter showed no evidence of recognizing that 
principle and the seriousness of its violation 
greene allowed poindexter to remain free while he appeals five 
felony convictions of conspiracy making false statements and 
obstruction 
and the judge did not impose a fine noting that poindexter had 
already incurred huge legal bills 
however greene said that allowing poindexter to get off without 
a prison term would be tantamount to a statement that to lie to 
and obstruct congress was of no great moment 
the congress cant fulfill its constitutional duties if it is 
obstructed by highranking officials the judge said 
poindexter 53 who served as president reagans national 
security adviser from late 1985 until revelations about the 
irancontra affair forced his resignation in november 1986 is the 
highestranking reagan administration official to be convicted of a 
felony 
he was found guilty of lying to congress in 1986 by falsely 
assuring lawmakers that his staff was not secretly helping arm the 
nicaraguan contras and by giving false testimony and preparing an 
inaccurate chronology to conceal us involvement in a 1985 
shipment of missiles to iran 
six other men including retired marine lt col oliver l 
north a former poindexter aide have been placed on probation 
after being convicted or pleading guilty to crimes in the 
irancontra affair 
poindexter showed little emotion except to smile at his wife 
linda after the sentence was announced 
the couple kissed and walked armandarm out of the courtroom 
after the 40minute proceeding as the poindexters left the us 
courthouse they briefly joined a throng of 30 supporters who were 
carrying banners and chanting full pardon now 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said there would be no 
white house comment on the sentence asked if he could rule out a 
pardon by president bush of his colleague from the reagan 
administration fitzwater said i can rule out having any comment 
on this matter while the case is under appeal 
north who was sentenced to community service in addition to 
probation told cbs news admiral poindexter is as he has always 
been a good and decent man and i think its a crying shame that 
hes been treated so shabbily afrter spending more than 30 years in 
the service of his country 
greene said that poindexter north and others involved in the 
irancontra affair carried out their own private policy by 
helping arm the nicaraguan rebels after congress passed legislation 
forbidding further us military aid 
admiral poindexter and his associates obstructed the congress 
nullifying the decisions that body had made on the issues of 
supplies to the contras greene said 
they decided the policy of the boland amendment was wrong 
they went about to violate it on a large scale and for a lengthy 
period and then to lie about their activities to prevent the 
public from finding out greene said 
prosecutor dan k webb had urged the judge to ignore any 
argument that lying to congress is a technical violation of the 
law 
this case is a classic example of what happens when these laws 
are violated webb said we literally had this admiral and one 
very misguided and confused lieutenant colonel operating a private 
war in nicaragua and congress didnt know about it 
afterward webb said greene had imposed a very fair and very 
proper sentence that would be a warning to other public officials 
defense attorney richard w beckler urged greene to spare 
poindexter a prison term saying the retired rear admiral had has 
always put his devotion to the country above any selfish interests 
of his own 
while he held a high office i dont think anyone can 
appreciate the power and pressure that bears on that beckler 
said 
every step can be a misstep the defense lawyer added 
clearly missteps were taken here 
webb disputed becklers argument that poindexter should be 
placed on probation because north and others were not given prison 
terms 
john poindexter is the superior and he unfortunately has to 
be held accountable for the events that made up irancontra webb 
said 
under new sentencing guidelines that do not apply to the case 
because they took effect after the irancontra affair poindexter 
could have been ordered to serve 21 months to 27 months in prison 
greene said 
but the judge said it would be unfair to order such a long 
sentence while other irancontra figures enjoyed the benefits of 
probation 
in a clear reference to the testimony north gave at his own 
trial last year the judge said that poindexter unlike many 
defendants did not take the stand to exculpate himself by lying 
under oath 
the judge said that after the irancontra affair unraveled 
poindexter and north engaged in the destruction of evidence one 
step ahead of the congress and two steps ahead of the attorney 
general and the fbi

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani has 
escaped an assassination attempt the third reported since last 
fall irans dissident mujahedeen khalq said monday 
the group in a dispatch to the associated press in nicosia from 
its washington office said the attempt was in late april but did 
not provide an exact date 
there reportedly have been at least two previous attempts to 
kill rafsanjani in october and in january the official media in 
iran has not confirmed either incident reported separately by 
travelers from iran 
rafsanjani however has denied the attempts which the sources 
said involved bodyguards trying to shoot the president but being 
overpowered by other security men in his entourage 
the mujahedeen said in the latest attempt one of the bodyguards 
was planning to kill rafsanjani with a revolver while he was 
moving from one location to the other it did not explain if he 
was at home or on the road 
but other bodyguards spotted him and the wouldbe assassin was 
arrested before being able to pull the trigger said the statement 
from mujahedeen khalq or the peoples warriors 
the unattributed sixsentence report did not provide any other 
detail it said security measures to protect rafsanjani 
increased dramatically after the incident 
iran has been gripped by a power struggle between liberals and 
hardliners since the death a year ago of the founder of the 
islamic republic ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
rafsanjani 55 leads the socalled pragmatists seeking closer 
relations with the west to end irans international isolation and 
attract foreign investment and expertise needed to rebuild the 
devastated economy 
he is opposed by radicals led by former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi who believe improving relations with the west 
would destroy khomeinis islamic ideology 
although the mujahedeen khalq helped khomeini topple the 
prowestern monarchy in 1979 they later rebelled against the rigid 
domestic and foreign policies pursued by the islamic revolution 
the group is based in iraq irans main enemy 
a few of its underground supporters in iran have survived a wide 
crackdown against opposition groups ordered by khomeini in the 
mid1980s thousands of mujahedeen were arrested and many were 
subsequently executed

championed sober driving programs died when a jeep traveling at 
high speed slammed through her house and crushed her as she slept 
on the living room couch 
a man with a record of drunken driving arrests was behind the 
wheel police said the man who faces trial this week on an

cleanup crews watched anxiously monday as choppy 
seas and stiff winds delayed efforts to unload thousands of gallons 
of fuel that threatened to spill from the torn hull of the cruise 
ship bermuda star 
the 617foot vessel was freed sunday night from a rocky ledge 
off cape cod almost 13 hours after it strayed too close to shore 
and ran aground in dense fog 
divers found a 90by2foot tear on the ships bottom after it 
dropped anchor about 3 miles from the ledge in buzzards bay the 
rip exposed four tanks holding more than 110000 gallons of fuel 
oil the coast guard said 
coast guard officials confirmed monday night that 7500 gallons 
of fuel had spilled from the ships tanks into the bay part of 
that spill washed ashore at naushon island in the bay the coast 
guard told a news conference in providence ri 
the oil splashed the largely unpopulated island with a gooey 
swath up to 4 feet wide along a fivemile stretch of shoreline 
said coast guard cmdr larry doyle 
another 100000 gallons of what doyle described as thick 
heavy dense oil may leak into the sea 
it has the potential to be a medium spill doyle said 
doyle said the coast guard believed it was more prudent to wait 
for the weather to clear than to risk the safety of the repair 
crews 
im not in any rush to hurry through that he said the 
vessel is stable its safe 
cleanup of naushon island which lies off the tip of woods hole 
west of the cape cod canal entrance was expected to begin tuesday 
morning doyle said water pressing against the ship kept the oil 
inside while anchored the coast guard said plans to tow the ship 
to a dry dock in new york had to be scrapped until the holes could 
be patched and the fuel unloaded 
if you moved the ship now the inertia of the sea would take 
away the balancing effect we have and it would suck the oil right 
out of the tear in the ship said steve aitkins a coast guard 
spokesman in boston 
but rain and fog coupled with winds of 15 to 30 mph and 
2to4foot waves threatened efforts to skim off the spilled fuel 
and unload the rest 
its kind of a catch22 the weather can help you as much as 
it can hinder you said randy krahn a coast guard petty officer 
in providence ri the rain can help break up the oil but too 
much makes the cleanup harder 
forecasters predicted the weather would get worse before it got 
better possibly on tuesday morning 
aitkins said the coast guards atlantic area strike team in 
mobile ala has been notified to be ready to move if the oil 
starts to leak and local cleanup crews could not contain it 
the panamanianflagged vessel on a cruise from new york to nova 
scotia went aground in fog sunday morning the more than 1060 
passengers and some crew members were ferried to new bedford in the 
evening and taken by bus to hotels in boston 
there was a sudden stop and then a metallic noise then 
immediately there was an oily smell we went out on deck and we 
could see the oil coming out on the water said passenger paul 
kelly of columbia sc 
tests for drugs and alcohol were performed on key members of the 
crew but the results were not immediately available the coast 
guard said 
david roddy senior vice president of bermuda star line cruises 
in teaneck nj described the ships captain hans lewing as 
an excellent popular captain with 20 years of shipping 
experience 
lewing had been with the company for three years and had a good 
record roddy said 
passengers who had their sevenday excursion abruptly ended 
would be offered another week or 10day cruise or a refund roddy 
said the company also would pay their airfare to return home from 
boston he said

alberto fujimori who routed mario vargas 
llosa in the presidential runoff will face a tough task when he 
takes over the leadership of a country that at times appears almost 
ungovernable 
on july 28 fujimori is to become president of a 
violencewracked nation that some analysts have described as a 
fragile ship in the midst of a hurricane 
the abilities of fujimori who will turn 52 on inauguration day 
will be tested immediately because peru has an array of daunting 
problems including its 2000 percent annual inflation massive 
unemployment more than a decade of terrorism and protracted drug 
trafficking 
i fully accept the challenge of facing the deep crisis 
affecting our nation the onetime agricultural engineer told 
cheering supporters late sunday when his victory was announced 
peruvians voted earlier the same day 
but many wonder how he will face the challenge 
though he won in a rout fujimori will enjoy no grace period 
before he must act 
this will be a very shortlived honeymoon said alfredo 
torres chief pollster for the independent apoyo company he will 
have to apply adjustment measures almost immediately 
fujimori played on fears of vargas llosas economic shock 
treatment which the celebrated writer of such novels as aunt 
julia and the scriptwriter said would pull the country out of the 
worst crisis of its history 
fujimori said the economy could recover with gradual 
measures but he never fully explained what measures those would be 
vargas llosa planned to privatize most of the chronically 
inefficient public enterprises perus bloated bureaucracy of over 
1 million people would be cut by at least 30 percent he said 
in a country where 40 percent of the population lives in extreme 
poverty with a minimum monthly wage of 35 that covers not even 
the most basic needs vargas llosas proposal appeared unbearable 
political analysts say most peruvians concluded that vargas 
llosas proposal simply spelled more suffering 
fujimori advocates many of the populist measures of discredited 
centerleft president alan garcia including price controls and 
subsidies 
but he never said where the money to cover those programs would 
come from 
peru suspended payment on its 22 billion foreign debt in 1987 
the nations treasury is 100 million in the red 
it is a plunge into dark oiga weekly magazine said in an 
editorial monday we hope we are wrong 
torres explained fujimoris rising star as an illusory search 
for a costfree escape from the crisis 
this phenomenon comes from the illusion that leaders not the 
ideas they carry out are to blame for failures torres said 
this illusion led many to believe it was alan garcia who failed 
not his populism he said 
until four months ago fujimori whose parents immigrated from 
japan in 1930 was politically unknown 
in firstround presidential elections april 8 he surged past 
seven other candidates to win 24 percent just three percentage 
points behind favored vargas llosa a runoff election was called 
because no candidate had captured 50 percent of the vote 
unofficial results of sundays runoff showed fujimori with 56 
percent of the vote and vargas llosa with 35 percent 
in washington the state department congratulated the peruvian 
people for what it called a victory for peruvian democracy in the 
face of terrorist threats 
peruvians were particularly attracted to fujimori because of his 
japanese descent polls showed peruvians admire japan as a 
technological power throughout the campaign fujimori offered to 
bring peru technology 
but polls showed fujimori was much less popular among the 60000 
japaneseperuvians who instead favored vargas llosa a novelist 
who spent much of the last decade writing abroad 
fujimori said he will renegotiate perus foreign debt we will 
abide by our commitments he said sunday night we must 
reestablish links with the financial community 
that is a departure from garcias tough stand on foreign credit 
in 1986 garcia limited debt payments to 10 percent of the nations 
export revenue a year later peru stopped paying even that 10 
percent 
fujimori said he plans to visit the united states and canada 
this month seeking economic aid 
both countries are friends and could help us implement our 
plans he told reporters monday 
he said he also will meet with officials at the united nations 
to present a 12 billion plan to help peruvians affected by the 
countrys worst drought this century 
fujimori badly needs financial support to carry out his plans 
for agricultural development to counter continuing drug trafficking 
and terrorism peru is the chief producer of coca leaf the raw 
material of cocaine 
about 200000 peasants make their living from growing coca 
which once refined becomes cocaine fujimori disagrees with us 
officials who favor using military force to eradicate coca 
plantations 
fujimori must also face another problem a decadelong war with 
maoist shining path guerrillas that has claimed over 18000 lives 
including a voter killed on election day when guerrillas blew up a 
polling station in huancayo

president mikhail s gorbachev has agreed to meet 
with the presidents of the three baltic republics for the first 
time since he branded their independence moves unconstitutional 
spokesmen said monday 
tuesdays scheduled meeting comes amid other new contacts 
between the kremlin and lithuania the baltic republic that has 
taken the boldest moves toward independence and has suffered most 
moscows economic blockade against lithuania enters its third month 
next week 
it also comes one week after gorbachev returned from the united 
states where congressional leaders made clear they would hold up 
approval of a ussoviet trade deal that gorbachev wants until the 
embargo on lithuania is lifted 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
he had no specifics on the talks but we welcome dialogue of any 
kind hopefully it will lead to a resolution of this issue 
the session between gorbachev and the baltic presidents could 
signal a new kremlin diplomatic initiative to try to break the 
impasse over the republics independence campaigns 
gorbachev has said the republics are free to pursue 
independence but insists they do so in accordance with soviet 
constitutional guidelines that were set down in april and require a 
referendum legislative approval and a wait of up to five years 
presidents vytautas landsbergis of lithuania arnold ruutel of 
estonia and anatoly gorbunov of latvia will meet with gorbachev as 
well as his federation council a new presidential advisory body 
according to spokesmen from the three republics 
also on tuesday lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
will meet with soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov to discuss the 
economic embargo and her governments halt of the conscription of 
lithuanians into the soviet army a lithuanian spokesman said 
landsbergis and gorbunov met monday in the lithuanian city of 
panevezhis to map strategy for the kremlin session said rita 
dapkus a spokeswoman for the lithuanian parliament the supreme 
council 
the three presidents formed a united front last month to press 
their drives to restore the independence they lost 50 years ago 
when forcibly annexed by josef stalin the leaders had asked for a 
meeting with gorbachev 
gorbachev later met with ruutel and gorbunov as well as mrs 
prunskiene but he has remained firm that they must either suspend 
or revoke their declarations of independence 
although estonia and latvia have taken a more cautious path 
toward secession lithuania declared its independence march 11 and 
immediately began passing laws to back up the declaration among 
those laws was one suspending conscription of lithuanian youths 
into the soviet army 
gorbachev embargoed all oil most natural gas and other raw 
material shipments to lithuania on april 18 to press the republic 
to rescind proindependence laws lithuania has said since then 
that it is willing to negotiate on rolling back those laws but 
steadfastly refuses to revoke its declaration of independence 
the soviet leader declared independence moves by latvia and 
estonia to be unconstitutional on may 14 
algimantas cekoulis a supreme council consultant who was 
accompanying mrs prunskiene to moscow along with deputy prime 
minister algirdas brazauskas said he believed he saw some 
movement on the kremlins position 
moscow is sort of trying to find common ground he said 
the very fact that they soviet leaders are conversing with us 
on the basis that we are not revoking the 11th of march 
declaration is the movement 
cekoulis said that ryzhkov had spoken of the soviet union 
suffering bruises from the own economic blockade hurting not 
only lithuania but other republics as well 
if russia has the bruises from that blockade that is the 
reason for these movements he said they have shot their own 
feet 
he also disclosed that yuri maslyukov head of the soviet state 
planning commission and a politburo member met last week with 
lithuanias economics minister vytas navickas and discussed what 
lithuania could buy and sell from the soviet union on a ruble 
basis the talks covered a wide range of goods including those 
that were cut off by the kremlin embargo cekoulis said

about 60000 supporters of the opposition 
alliance took to the streets monday to protest the projected 
victory of the socialist party heir to the communists who have 
controlled the balkan nation since 1944 
crowds rallied outside election headquarters shouting down 
with the red mafia after unofficial returns from sundays 
parliamentary vote showed the 16party union of democratic forces 
in second place 
hundreds of cars and taxis most of them displaying udf flags 
later crisscrossed downtown sofia honking their horns passersby 
cheered and waved udf flags 
small groups of udf supporters walked through the city shouting 
anticommunist slogans or cheering the alliance 
the opposition alliance had predicted victory in the nations 
first free balloting in 58 years and its leaders claimed election 
irregularities affected the outcome of voting for the 400 
parliamentary seats 
official election results were not expected until tuesday 
if their victory is confirmed the socialists would be the only 
ruling party in eastern europe to be returned to power in a 
multiparty election the communists changed their name to 
socialists in april 
the party has said it would proceedly slowly with reforms the 
opposition alliance favors swift change to a westernstyle market 
economy to tackle growing inflation a 10 billion foreign debt and 
consumer shortages 
plamen darakchiev an alliance member and deputy editor in chief 
of the partys daily demokratsiya predicted the new political 
lineup will leave our people polarized in parliament 
opposition chairman zhelyu zhelev told the rally the group would 
not form a coalition with the ruling party 
in the national assembly we will be a powerful opposition 
faction he said 
in a nationwide television broadcast premier andrei lukanov 
urged all public and political forces to work together the 
state news agency bta reported 
there are no losers in the present elections because in the 
final reckoning the victory of democracy is a victory for all 
he was quoted as saying 
only in sofia the capital did the alliance top the socialists 
according to a forecast by the west german polling group infas the 
socialists took the countryside and smaller cities 
the infas projections showed the socialists with 47 percent of 
the vote the opposition alliance with 36 percent and the 
mainstream agrarian party once a docile communist ally with 8 
percent 
according to infas the mainly ethnic turkish movement for 
rights and freedoms will get 57 percent and the remaining 38 
parties the rest 
the projections were based on the vote in 250 polling districts 
of the 400 parliament seats 200 will be allocated according to 
the percentage of votes each party receives the remainder will go 
to candidates who receive more than 50 percent of the vote 
a second round of voting is scheduled for sunday for races in 
which no candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote 
western observers said the voting was generally free and fair 
although there were scattered incidents of apparent manipulation 
michel aliotmarie who headed the european democratic union 
delegation said any irregularities did not appear to have affected 
the results substantially the state bta news agency reported 
georgi spasov spokesman for the opposition coalition said 
alleged irregularities included illegal campaigning in front of 
polling stations 
we are not trying to reject totally the results but we will 
call the attention of the central electoral committee and we shall 
seek reelection in some places said petar beron an opposition 
official 
aliotmarie attributed the socialists lead to the partys 
predominance in public life and the early scheduling of the 
elections 
the opposition wanted the elections postponed until fall to 
allow more time for parties to organize 
the communist party in bulgaria has been a strong political 
force for nearly a century it won 20 percent of the vote in the 
last free election in 1932 and has ruled since 1944 
bulgaria had only a nascent opposition when reform communists 
including current president petar mladenov ousted longtime 
communist strongman todor zhivkov last november 
the opposition alliance has gained considerable support in 
recent months especially in sofia as it pressed the communists to 
accelerate change

two 19yearold white men on monday were dealt 
the longest possible prison terms for the mobbeating and death of 
a young black man who had come to their neighborhood to buy a car 
justice thaddeus owens handed down the sentences after a 
prosecutor called the slaying neanderthaltype behavior by the 
white mob 
the aug 23 shooting death of 16yearold yusuf hawkins in 
brooklyns bensonhurst section inflamed racial passions in the city 
its a small joy for myself but a great victory for black 
people all over the state hawkins father moses stewart said 
after the sentencings 
owens sentenced joseph fama named by prosecutors as the 
triggerman to 32 and twothirds years to life in prison he was 
convicted of seconddegree murder riot unlawful imprisonment 
weapons possession and other crimes 
defense lawyer david depetris said he would appeal and added 
that he wasnt surprised 
earlier owens handed keith mondello five and onethird to 16 
years in prison plus a 2000 fine mondello identified as the 
ringleader had been acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges 
but convicted of riot unlawful imprisonment and discrimination 
as owens delivered famas sentence in the packed courtroom 
stewart watched intently and said yes 
hawkins mother diane hawkins put her head on his shoulder and 
cried as she looked at fama 
im glad the decision came out like it did even though it 
wont bring my son back ms hawkins said 
while supporters of hawkins family applauded members of famas 
family screamed in italian and wept 
not my son not my son shouted his mother josephine fama 
a cousin of fama shouted joey joey she went toward 
hawkins family but was restrained by her relatives and court 
officers 
at his sentencing mondello declined an offer to address the 
court 
without mr mondello there would not have been the death of 
anyone it was a senseless death said the judge of the 
triallevel state supreme court 
hawkins and three friends had gone to bensonhurst a primarily 
white neighborhood to look at a used car a mob of whites having 
been warned by mondellos exgirlfriend about outsiders set 
upon the black teenagers 
the judge said that if mondello had felt threatened all he 
had to do was go home and call the police 
instead he said the gang pursued mr hawkins if they had 
stayed where they were none of this would have happened 
assistant district paul burns arguing for the maximum term 
called the killing a neanderthal type of behavior 
defense attorney stephen murphy told the judge i believe that 
the law should rise above public opinion 
later murphy said mondello was very distraught over his 
sentence but he added under the circumstances with the public 
outcry i felt a sentence like that was going to be given 
with the fama conviction the city remained calm but when 
mondellos verdict was delivered acquitting him of the most 
serious charges crowds of blacks hurled rocks and bottles in 
brooklyn and several reporters black and white were roughed up 
reacting to the sentences monday bensonhurst residents stressed 
that their neighborhood doesnt deserve the reputation the case has 
brought it 
a man who identified himself only as h bosque 47 said the 
white mob that attacked hawkins got the wrong guy but it doesnt 
mean everybodys bad here the media talked to the ignorant 
people and put them on tv 
a delicatessen owner who wouldnt give his name said we cant 
wait for the whole thing to be over were not racist 
mayor david dinkins said now that the criminal justice system 
has spoken we all must join our hearts heads and hands together 
to rid our city of the racism that destroys lives and communities 
we have had enough of tragedy together we must and we will 
move the healing process forward 
opening statements are expected monday in the trial of john 
vento another of the white youths charged in the case owens set 
trial dates in september november and january for five other

probe into what federal agents say appears to have been a 
multimilliondollar aliensmuggling operation run by officials 
linked to noriega 
while prosecutors have no firm evidence tying noriega or his 
lieutenants to the ring theres a real strong possibility they 
were involved said us customs agent gary small noriega is 
awaiting trial on drug charges in florida 
immigration officials said last week that tens of thousands of 
immigrants had paid noriega millions of dollars to use his nation

university of utah president chase n 
peterson his administration marred by a 500000 transfer of funds 
to a cold fusion research program announced monday he will retire 
next year 
the announcement at a campus news conference followed last 
weeks academic senate resolution questioning petersons ability to 
administer the affairs of the 23543student university in light of 
the furor over the money transfer 
however peterson said he had no intention of resigning under 
pressure from one of the important constituency groups i serve 
i still have goals to consolidate and advance before i step 
down from this responsibility 
nevertheless he acknowledged that the period of time i can 
effectively provide leadership is nearing an end 
it is my intention to dedicate the next year to accomplishing 
my remaining goals and to position this university for new 
leadership following the 199091 academic year he said 
institutional council chairman james s jardine accepted 
petersons decision saying the council reluctantly supported 
it 
we recognize and acknowledge the great leadership energy 
dedication and devotion which peterson and his wife grethe have 
provided the university jardine said he also praised the couples 
contributions involving higher education and public issues in utah 
gov norm bangerter said petersons last year at the university 
would be productive and fruitful 
peterson 60 was the schools vice president for health 
sciences when surgeons completed the first artificial heart implant 
in 1982 on seattlearea dentist barney clark who died after 112 
days on the device 
he became the universitys 11th president in 1983 succeeding 
david p gardner 
the controversy over the national cold fusion institute erupted 
late last month when it became known the 500000 donation 
characterized as an anonymous outside gift actually was the 
result of a petersonauthorized transfer of money from the schools 
research foundation 
he had come under sharp criticism twice before in the past 15 
months first for the schools 1989 announcement of a breakthrough 
in the quest for a usable source of fusion energy and then for his 
handling of a 15 million donation that later was returned 
chemist b stanley pons of the university and british colleague 
martin fleischmann announced in march 1989 that they had achieved a 
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a tabletop experiment 
despite extreme scientific skepticism that continues today the 
utah legislature appropriated 5 million to establish the national 
cold fusion institute in the schools research park and to protect 
the states patent rights 
the center has sought to raise funds from the federal government 
and private corporations with limited success a department of 
energy panel recommended against government funding and the only 
confirmed contribution was 50000 from utah power amp light co in 
march 
pons said he was grateful for petersons support 
he made a strong effort to see it through we regret that it 
is an issue in his retirement decision pons said we still 
know that we are right and we are sure that soon he will be able 
to list cold fusion as one of the positive accomplishments by the 
university of utah 
in june salt lake medical equipment manufacturer james l 
sorenson donated 15 million in pharmaceutical stock to the 
university with the understanding the medical school and hospital 
would be renamed in his honor 
peterson was forced to return the money after protests from 
doctors faculty and students

state election officials ordered a recount 
monday to determine who won the democratic nomination for governor 
because the margin in unofficial primary returns was too narrow 
the recount of the sevenway race mandated by state law will 
begin wednesday said secretary of state allen beermann he said it 
could be june 20 or later before the board reconvenes to certify 
the results 
unofficial returns of the may 15 primary showed attorney ben 
nelson in first place with 44556 votes and a 41vote lead over his 
nearest challenger bill hoppner hoppner a former aide to us 
sen bob kerrey dneb had 44515 votes 
because the margin between first and second place amounted to 
less than 1 percent of the frontrunners total it forced an 
automatic recount it had been known for several weeks that a 
recount would be ordered monday was the election boards regularly 
scheduled meeting 
the recount will be done by hand in 70 counties that still use 
paper ballots and by machine in the other 23 beermann said 
the democratic nominee will challenge incumbent gov kay orr 
the nations first republican woman elected governor who seeks a 
second fouryear term 
mrs orr chairs the elections board the board of canvassers 
and voted for the recount as did the other three members present 
one member was absent 
hoppner supporters hope ballots that may have gone uncounted in 
lancaster county where their candidate did particularly well will 
help they hope that ballots mistakenly marked with ballpoint pens 
instead of pencils and thus not read by electronic scanning 
devices will fall largely into hoppners column 
the other democratic candidates are former omaha mayor mike 
boyle lincoln mayor bill harris former university of nebraska 
regent robert prokop former state sen don eret and robb nimic

mosbacher will personally inspect retail store shelves in seoul 
next week in connection with reports that south korea is reviving 
restrictions against imports commerce department officials said 
monday 
mosbacher told members of a highlevel south korean trade 
delegation he hopes that the reports are not true but he is 
asking his department counselor wayne berman to make a seeing 
is believing check into stores during a previously planned 
journey to seoul said commerce spokeswoman pat woodward 
former trade minister kum jinho leader of the visiting 
mission acknowledged there were fewer luxury goods in some 
department stores but denied it was the result of government 
policy 
some stores were responding to austerity demands of korean 
womens groups and consumer organizations but this affected a 
very small portion of the retail trade he said you will see a 
flood of imported goods not only from the united states but from 
every country in the world kum added to reporters 
aides quoted mosbacher as telling the visitors that if the 
government is intervening to discourage sale of imported goods 
that would be a genuine problem that has to be dealt with and 
berman would seek the facts during his visit to address a 
uskorean business conference next week 
they quoted kum as telling mosbacher the matter had been 
exaggerated by media coverage that the press overreacted 
kum also talked about the issue at a ceremony announcing korean 
airs purchase of 23 boeing 747400 jetliners for 48 billion in 
one of the largest orders ever placed with the us aerospace 
company 
korean consumer groups he said were objecting to imported 
luxury furniture and glassware at a time when their countrys 
global trade surplus was shrinking 
while running a surplus with the united states south korea 
reportedly showed a 12 billiondollar global deficit the first 
quarter of this year ambassador park tongjin said the plane order 
represented a sincere effort to reduce the surplus with america 
james w booth executive vice president of the american chamber 
of commerce in korea referred to the return of protectionism to 
korea in a dispatch from seoul in mondays boston globe the 
dispatch said gucci lanvin burberry and bally boutiques have 
mysteriously closed and department stores no longer stock 
imported wines womens wear or neckties 
a spokesman of luckygoldstar one of the countrys largest 
trading companies was quoted as saying the government apparently 
decided to halt luxury imports because they dont want rich 
people spending more than poor people

prime minister brian mulroney said monday that 
canada should proceed with the ratification by june 23 of the meech 
lake constitutional accord despite some provinces fears about the 
special status afforded quebec 
it is clear there are serious misunderstandings in this 
country we cannot afford to ignore he told the house of commons 
in his first speech since the 11 first ministers mulroney and 
the 10 provincial premiers reached a tentative deal over the 
weekend to ratify the controversial accord 
under the deal holdout provinces newfoundland manitoba and new 
brunswick will try to pass meech lake before june 23 when by law 
it is due to expire under meech lake quebec a largely 
frenchspeaking province with 67 million of canadas 25 million 
population would be recognized as a distinct society other 
amendments include broadening the powers of all provinces senate 
reform and a canada clause regarding aboriginals 
after seven rancorous days of private talks convened at the 
behest of mulroney the ministers came up with a package of 
agreements that would allow the accord to be approved 
premier clyde wells of newfoundland said monday his legislature 
will hold a free vote on the accord with deputies voting their 
conscience and not by party dictates he said he would have 
preferred a full referendum of his provinces 550000plus 
residents 
wells believes meech lake injures the tradition of equality 
among provinces and weakens the federal state 
a legislative vote was seen as good news for meech lake 
supporters because it would be faster than a referendum and would 
hold more potential for approval than a referendum 
manitoba and new brunswick legislatures are expected to approve 
meech lake premiers robert bourassa of quebec and david peterson 
of ontario on monday publicly opposed extending the june 23 
deadline monday helping to scuttle any referendum plans by wells 
as being too timeconsuming 
the 3yearold accord would make quebec a full supporter of the 
1982 constitution which the province refused to sign because it 
failed to distinguish quebec as a distinct society

a federal appeals court ordered the department 
of energy to pay 250000 to the state of ohio and the us 
treasury in a case involving a troubled nuclear weapons plant 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals upheld a district court 
ruling that the resource conservation and recovery act and the 
clean air act dont shield the doe from liability because congress 
waived sovereign immunity for civil actions under both statutes 
the energy department owns the feed materials production center 
18 miles northwest of cincinnati which was used from 1952 until 
last year to process uranium for nuclear weapons the plant has 
been idle since last year to allow cleanup of the site 
area residents already have won a 78 million settlement from 
the doe for their claim that their health may be endangered and 
their property value diminished because of their closeness to the 
site 
the state of ohio sued the energy department in 1986 requesting 
fines for improper hazardous waste disposal and release of 
radioactive materials at the plant 
us district court in cincinnati never got to address whether 
the energy department and its contractors should be liable for 
improperly disposing hazardous waste or polluting the air or water 
the parties in the case agreed in december 1988 to a settlement 
in which doe would pay up to 1 million of that amount 750000 
was to be paid to ohio with 250000 riding on the appeal of the 
sovereign immunity issue 
under mondays ruling the doe will have to pay the remaining 
250000 of the settlement half to ohio and half to the federal 
treasury 
hazardous wastes dating from the world war ii manhattan project 
are stored at fernald a citizen watchdog group says many barrels 
storing hazardous and chemical wastes are rusting and leaking 
the us environmental protection agency is supervising the 
cleanup of the site which is expected to take up to 50 years 
judge boyce f martin jr wrote the opinion of the court in 
which judge nathaniel r jones concurred judge ralph b guy jr 
wrote a dissenting opinion 
ohio attorney general anthony celebrezze jr called mondays 
ruling another victory for ohio and its citizens in what has 
often been a complex and frustrating battle with the us 
department of energy and the federal department of justice 
calls to the doe seeking comment were not returned

in the arid west where water is more

the indians last year won rights to much of the water in 
westcentral wyoming now their destiny is no longer entirely in 
the hands of the white man who relegated them to the 25 
millionacre reservation in the mid1800s 
look how many years weve taken the back seat to everything 
says burton hutchinson northern arapaho tribal chairman were 
the ones in the drivers seat now it feels good real good real 
nice 
the us supreme court last year ruled that an 1868 treaty gave 
the northern arapahos and shoshones priority rights to 500000 
acrefeet of water from the wind river roughly twice what the 
6000 indians previously controlled an acrefoot is enough to 
cover an acre to a depth of one foot

its springtime in kashmir and there are 
roses everywhere 
bigger than peonies blushpink roses bloom in regal splendor in 
the meticulously tended 17th century mogul gardens neatly pruned 
and staked white and yellow roses invoke the image of past 
prosperity outside the shuttered tourist hotels facing dal lake 
kashmir crossroads of the ancient world way station on the old 
silk road from the near east to the far east was once a 
paradise 
today it is an armed camp 
employees of the state government whose association with indian 
authority is enough to make them targets for the guns of 
independenceminded kashmiris are escorted by armed guards from 
barricaded hostels inside the compound of the nolongerneeded 
tourist office to barricaded office buildings 
in the mogul gardens overlooking the lake the only people in 
sight are two elderly gardeners and two young soldiers taking a 
break from trying to contain the burgeoning moslem revolt 
down in the city red roses are shredded petal by petal and 
scattered on fresh graves the fragrance of the roses wafts across 
these martyrs cemeteries created for victims of the struggle 
between moslem separatists and the government of india which is 
officially secular but dominated by hindus 
indian soldiers and paramilitary police guard srinagars main 
streets and every bridge over the jhelum river which snakes 
through the city of 1 million people 
by day parts of srinagar assume an air of nearnormality small 
groceries and butcher shops open pedestrians bicycles horse 
carts minibuses and cars ply the streets 
by night when curfew is imposed as it has been since winter 
srinagar is a ghost town 
streets start emptying an hour before the usual 6 pm deadline 
people check their watches to see how much time they have to get 
home or at least out of sight of the patrols 
packs of shaggy black and brown dogs roam the streets with their 
sturdy puppies rested after a day of lolling in the sun a single 
howl starts a canine chorus that reverberates across the city 
out on dal lake and adjacent nageen lake soldiers and dogs are 
rarely heard about 1200 houseboats are licensed to take paying 
guests but hardly any tourists arrive these days 
moonlight shimmers across the water ducks quack once in a while 
the occasional dip of an oar ripples the lakes glassy surface 
houseboat dwellers and their small arrowlike boats called 
shikaras are not bound by the curfew if they stay away from 
shore 
kashmir whose name was anglicized by british colonial rulers to 
describe the cashmere wool of the shawls and carpets still 
woven here has long been synomymous with beauty 
over the centuries followers of most of the worlds great 
religions came here moslems now the majority hindus who 
predominate elsewhere in india buddhists who still have a few 
remote monasteries in kashmir christians who operate a few 
schools and jews whose last known descendants departed for israel 
or indian cities in the past decade 
one legend says moses a patriarch of the jewish christian and 
islamic faiths passed this way 
another holds that jesus did not die on the cross but came to 
kashmir lived to the age of 80 and was buried as yuz asaf in a 
tomb that still can be seen in the center of srinagar a third says 
the prophet mohammed also sojourned in kashmir 
mogul emperors fresh from spreading islam across the hindu 
lands of india sought respite in kashmir building magnificent 
forts and terraced gardens of geometrical precision later the 
british would move their women and children from the summertime 
dust and heat of the plains to the cool clean air of the himalayan 
lakes and hills 
by the 1980s kashmir attracted 600000 tourists a year 
including about 50000 foreigners indian families and honeymooners 
came as the growing middle class found time and money to visit a 
place that seemed a bit foreign but didnt require a passport or 
foreign currency which was hard to come by 
in 1989 as the militant moslem movement spun into one of its 
periodic cycles of bombings and killings the number of visitors 
dropped by onethird 
tourists are so rare this year that word races through the city 
when an outsider is spotted especially one who pauses to admire 
the roses

thought for today what the foreigner finds most objectionable 
in american life is its lack of basic comfort no nation with any 
sense of material wellbeing would endure the food we eat the 
cramped apartments we live in the noise the traffic the crowded 
subways and buses american life in large cities at any rate is 
a perpetual assault on the senses and the nerves it is out of 
asceticism out of unworldliness precisely that we bear it

after the head counters the statisticians 
the politicians and the legislators do their numbers on redesigning 
house districts the lawyers will take over 
a lot of them in courtrooms everywhere 
the counting problems and controversies that have beset the 1990 
census are only a preview of the political struggle to come 
republicans see redistricting as the crucial ingredient in their 
effort to become competitive for control of the house democratic 
for 36 years 
the gop lost its first 1990 redistricting fight a week ago when 
voters in california overwhelmingly rejected a pair of ballot 
initiatives that would have set stringent rules for drawing 
congressional and legislative districts curbing the power of the 
state legislature currently democratic 
both measures would have set guidelines that republicans said 
would end gerrymandering the drawing of district lines tailored to 
one partys advantage one would have required a twothirds vote of 
the legislature to approve any redistricting plan the other would 
have taken district design away from the legislature and put it in 
the hands of a special commission 
they were rejected by margins of about 21 in the june 5 
primary leaving the shape of districts to be drawn the 
oldfashioned way by the legislature and the new governor to be 
elected in november 
republicans had pushed the ballot issues president bush urged 
their approval and helped raise funds to support them during two 
campaign swings to california democrats pushed harder and spent 
more with a television campaign said to have cost more than 5 
million the fact that there were rival republican proposals didnt 
help on measures most voters said they didnt know much about 
the numbers and the history of redistricting in california point 
to the national stakes that will be settled there over the next 
year california probably will gain seven house seats to a total 
of 52 to reflect its increased population there are now 28 
democrats and 17 republicans in the states house delegation 
a decade ago before new districts were drawn california 
democrats held only one seat more than republicans after 
redistricting they widened the margin to 11 
republicans cite that as a prime example of the way they say 
districts have been rigged against them one of their major goals 
in the 1992 elections is to gain at least veto power over state 
redistricting plans that means electing governors or gaining 
control in at least one branch of the state legislature since any 
one of the three can block the other two and force a deal 
to that end the republicans are using national campaign 
techniques in state legislative campaigns in close target states 
thats something the democrats started doing 20 years ago 
thirtysix states will be electing governors in 1990 democrats 
now outnumber republican governors 29 to 21 
and the democrats hold an even wider margin in legislative 
control they have twohouse majorities in 29 states republicans 
in only 8 with others divided 
the census results to be announced by the end of the year 
probably will shift about a dozen house seats most of them from 
the democratic industrial northeast and upper midwest to the sun 
belt states where republicans claim growing strength 
the national and state counts and the apportionment of the 435 
house seats begin the process mandated by the constitution next 
spring the census bureau will deliver detailed numbers down to 
the neighborhood to be used in drawing the lines for new 
congressional and legislative districts 
even that comes with a complication there could be a census 
adjustment in the summer of 1991 in order to produce population 
numbers more accurate than the head count 
big cities which claim their minorities and poor are 
undercounted want the adjustment and went to court to force it 
the adjustment decision wont be made until some time next year 
should there be an adjustment there will be two sets of numbers 
making painfully clear who won and who lost politically winners 
will get right down to redistricting losers will get right down to 
the federal courthouse 
republican strategy is to raise a variety of redistricting 
issues looking for one that would lead ultimately to a clear 
supreme court ruling against gerrymandering while blocking 
democratic district blueprints with their lawsuits 
democrats will do the same thing where they are confronted with 
gop plans interest groups will be in court too in the age of the 
personal computer everybody involved can become an instant expert 
with a rival district plan 
after the last census there were court challenges against 
redistricting plans in 47 of the 50 states this time it probably 
will be a sweep

network executives are having a cow dude 
but its not over fox broadcasting co and bart simpson stealing 
viewers from the big three 
if the ac nielsen co is correct about 2 million american 
households have simply turned off the boob tube 
nielsen offers no explanation for this drastic and unprecedented 
decline leading some network executives to snidely note that 
perhaps the missing viewers will one day be found with all those 
socks that vanish in the dryer 
the brass at abc cbs and nbc say they just dont believe that 
millions of people all of a sudden have stopped watching 
television 
turned to cable yes rented a video ok flipped to the 
simpsons on upstart fox oh all right but switched off the set 
entirely 
the use of the set has been a very very predictable 
behavior said alan wurtzel abcs research chief all of a 
sudden the rug has been pulled out and the behavior has been 
changed and no one can explain why 
nielsen has lost people they cant account for wurtzel 
said according to them they have simply gone away 
to realize why nielsens figures have turned tv land on its ear 
is to understand how the companys rating system is the foundation 
upon which the television industry is built 
people meters installed in 4000 homes across the country 
provide the ratings that help decide which shows make it and which 
get yanked but more importantly the nielsen numbers provide the 
base for what networks charge advertisers for commercial time 
and these are the nielsen figures for the first quarter of this 
year that have caused such a stir 
seemingly overnight overall television viewing is down 4 
percent as compared to the same period in 1989 
and in primetime audiences of women between the ages of 18 and 
49 crucial to advertisers because this group buys most consumer 
goods viewership is down nearly 10 percent 
here is where the controversy begins the networks say the 
nielsen people meter system used nationally since 1987 is 
fundamentally flawed and has produced incorrect numbers 
as proof of that alleged inaccuracy the networks point to 
localized ratings compiled during the may sweeps season which 
showed a much lower dropoff than the national people meter survey 
we think all of these things are related to the people 
meter wurtzel said every time you turn the channel youve 
got to punch this button were asking people to do something that 
is far beyond what is reasonable 
wurtzel and his counterparts at nbc and cbs blame the apparent 
dropoff in viewers on fatigue nielsen families are just plain 
pooped when it comes to punching a button every time they switch 
the dial the network folks say 
before 1987 nielsens national survey relied on boxes that 
required no viewer effort the old system told what was on the 
tube but not who was watching it the people meter is designed to 
show which family member is viewing 
nielsen stands behind its numbers saying it has checked and 
rechecked the people meters and found them to be accurate 
there truly was a decline in the first quarter said nielsen 
spokeswoman jo laverde it is probably the largest drop we have 
ever seen there has been a decline in homes using television but 
we have really not stated any conclusions on where they have gone 
and heres where the bottom line comes in abc cbs and nbc say 
they cannot sell advertising for their fall schedules based on 
ratings that are incorrect 
nbc alone has said it will lose 200 million this year in 
advertising revenue at least half of it directly caused by the 
drop in nielsen figures 
abc added gasoline to the fire two weeks ago by announcing it 
had come up with its own way of counting viewers for the purpose of 
selling commercial time 
cbs and nbc followed suit by saying they too might revamp 
advertising formulas this provides no small threat to nielsen 
which receives 20 million annually from each network according to 
a big three executive who refused to be quoted by name 
only fox has said it will continue to use the traditional 
strategy of ratings guarantees during this months up front 
sales season 
in a nutshell advertisers buy time on the fall schedule this 
month based on a networks guarantee to provide a certain number of 
viewers if a program draws less than the promised number the 
advertiser is given free make good time on another show 
if the nielsen figures continue to drop or at the very least 
fluctuate widely the big three stand to collectively lose hundreds 
of millions in advertising revenues 
fox can afford to keep the old system nielsen figures show the 
alternative networks audience grew by 20 percent last year

confidence isnt a problem for english 
singer john wesley harding this is after all a 24yearold whos 
written updates of the rolling stones sympathy for the devil 
and the everly brothers cathys clown on his debut album 
identity however might not be such a sure thing 
bob dylan is my father sings the man who takes his stage 
name from dylans 1968 album joan baez is my mother and i am 
their bastard son 
its a joke of course harding turns the tables on fans who 
love to spot the influences in a musicians work his debut album 
here comes the groom is a feast of word games and 
soundalikes as well as a showcase for a promising beginner 
i hate people who claim that theyre not influenced by people 
theyre obviously influenced by like the jesus and mary chain and 
the velvet underground i mean give me a break said the 
precocious young singer 
i decided to be completely the opposite to be playful i 
claimed that bob dylan is my father and joan baez is my mother 
which is obviously ridiculous 
the reallife wesley harding stace is quick to slyly note that 
dylan and baez were touring england together the year he was born 
in hastings growing up stace wanted to be a sportswriter he 
studied english literature at cambridge university writing a 
doctoral dissertation on the role of jimmy stewart in american 
films 
he also wrote plays short stories and songs armed with an 
acoustic guitar he regularly performed his songs and others in 
pubs around cambridge and in true music business fashion was 
discovered there 
there was little calculation in the name change he said stace 
took the name john wesley harding because his solo performances 
were kind of dylany 
i think changing your name is quite cool because nobody seems 
to do it right now he said everybody worries about integrity 
i couldnt imagine tracy chapman changing her name 
harding was signed to the independent british label demon 
records and put out his first record in 1988 
which brings up another comparison demon is elvis costellos 
label so is warner bros home of hardings us debut so is 
plangent visions music hardings song publishing company 
twothirds of costellos old backup band the attractions play on 
hardings album and in spots hardings voice sounds chillingly 
like costellos 
coincidence harding thinks so 
critics have got to do it theyve got to put you somewhere 
he said its like saying to a critic describe john wesley 
harding without making reference to bob dylan elvis costello 
graham parker nick lowe and the byrds its like saying describe 
a tennis ball without saying its round or its a ball i dont 
particularly object to it 
but its very foolhardy in a way clearly the songs that i 
write are nothing like elvis costello songs 
indeed such lines as if theres a nuclear winter at least it 
will snow show a sense of humor costello took a while to reveal 
he writes great songs and theyre cruel theyre untender 
he said theyre inhumane sometimes my songs are very 
gentle optimistic theyre meant to be very charming i cant see 
any similarity in the lyrical outlook whatsoever 
dont look for a lyric sheet on the album even though words 
tumble out of hardings mouth as fast as he can take a breath 
i used to buy john hiatt albums and by the time i got back to 
the house i read all the lyrics and it ruined the album for me 
he said my big thing is the shape of the song i dont want you 
to know where the song is going to end or where the bridge is 
its a little bit of oral drama 
hardings song the devil in me is a sampling of the 
worlds ills from war to acid rain put it down to the devil in 
me he sings as the narrator for those responsible 
harding calls it a folk sample of sympathy for the 
devil he said he wanted to do a politically responsible version 
of the amoral rolling stones song 
the song cathys new clown refers to the everly brothers 
classic only with a brief touch of the melody during the fadeout 
harding wanted to update the emotions expressed in the nearly 
30yearold song 
the tunes on hardings solo album are breezy and punchy only a 
duet with peter case sounds as if it were a traditional folk song 
with acoustic guitars 
i dont want to make folk music harding said all my 
favorite songwriters do folk music but theyre all dead or dirt 
poor phil spector is my hero i like phil spector i like abba i 
actually liked the carpenters they were great songs 
hardings now doing the dirty work of slowly trying to build an 
audience in the united states touring as an opening act for 
artists such as michelle shocked and the mighty lemon drops hes 
not working with a band now but promises a band tour this fall 
its not the divine right of a support act to have everyone 
like them he said if they find the idea of one man playing an 
acoustic guitar horrible then i let them get into the humor of 
some things i want to give them a chance to get into me

they were an unlikely duo 71yearold wesley 
wilson a bearded former landscaper and his assistant a lanky 
14yearold named fred barney 
they stood before a dozen or so sixthgraders on a recent sunny 
afternoon behind westview elementary school to teach tropical 
horticulture 
but there was a lot more to the lesson than growing orchids 
pineapple plants and aloe 
the care you give a plant is what you get out of it wilson 
tells the small group its like life 
and a lot like the relationship wilson and his assistant have 
that of mentor and protege 
the two came together through a school program that focuses on 
nurturing and inspiring young people by matching them with talented 
older volunteers 
you look forward to every week you come said wilson during 
a recent horticulture class at westview in northwestern dade 
county where he has met with students the past three years and 
formed a gardening club 
sure its work but you dont spend time grumbling about 
whats wrong with the world or your illnesses youre interested 
more about life in general said wilson who founded several 
plant organizations including the international palm society and 
the rare fruit council 
fred doesnt hesitate to attribute the improvement in his grades 
and outlook to wilsons influence 
when i first saw him wilson something clicked inside me 
said fred 
the teenager now attends the middle school next door getting 
mostly bs and joins wilson for his weekly class 
floridas senior mentor program has put the state home to a 
large population of retirees in the forefront of a growing trend 
nationwide to involve more older people in education 
the fastest growing segment of the population is 60plus 
said bentley lipscomb deputy director of the washingtonbased 
national association of partners in education this is going to 
be a tremendous resource to our educational system in this 
country 
launched statewide in 1983 the mentor program has been 
established in about onethird of floridas school districts and is 
one of a number of intergenerational programs that last year had 
more than 15000 senior volunteers helping about half as many young 
people 
the program is geared for creative students who may not qualify 
for gifted or other school programs as well as atrisk students 
volunteers who must be at least 50 currently the oldest is 88 
are screened and must provide references they are required to 
spend at least 10 hours with a student and projects can last six 
to 12 weeks or more 
funding comes from the state department of education and a 
50000 annual grant from chevron corp that will end next year 
dade county schools hired two retired school teachers and a 
retired administrator to recruit mentors who now number nearly 100 
retirees working with 220 children in grades two through 12 said 
ramona frischman coordinator of the schools department of 
community participation 
we dont just want highly professional retirees ms 
frischman said we also need and have a place for people wholl 
work with arts and crafts cooking needlepoint gardening and 
those kinds of things 
among the volunteers are retired lawyers writers artists and 
one of the first five black policemen hired by the city of miami in 
1944 
ralph white 73 who first patrolled miamis black neighborhoods 
on foot and spent 32 years on the force meets weekly with three 
atrisk students at westview and small groups of students 
interested in law enforcement 
i figured i could be instrumental in trying to motivate kids 
to stay in school and get a good education by telling them of my 
experiences and the accomplishments of the department said 
white who dropped out of school in junior high 
hes a tremendous allaround role model said westview 
principal richard artmeier 
in one project being watched nationwide a dozen dade students 
were selected as aides to members of the silverhaired legislature 
during a fourday session last october in tallahassee the students 
researched issues helped write resolutions and presented their 
positions on the floor 
despite initial resistance from some senior elected officials 
concerning the junior aides that was all overcome by the close of 
the session said maryon freifelder a senior advocate from miami 
beach 
some felt the students had no business being there she 
recalled at first they couldnt understand they couldnt see 
the connection by the end of the session three students gave 
a fiveminute presentation and got a standing ovation 
school officials say the intergenerational experience is 
mutually beneficial 
what theyre finding is they have so many things in common 
ms frischman said theyre finding they can make things happen 
together 
sometimes the most important learning is outside the classroom 
walls she added these people are living history what these 
children are learning is theyre survivors 
part of the programs success can be measured in the improvement 
in attendance and academic performance said ms frischman 
but theres an added benefit 
with an aging society this younger generation will have to 
deal with a much older population ms frischman said by 
sensitizing them at this age itll make the world a lot better for 
all of us

at 81 margot gayle doesnt get around much 
anymore but she recently led a group of senior citizens on a tour 
of st patricks cathedral gracie mansion and eight other 
manhattan landmarks and nobody left home 
the architectural expedition was done via telephone with a 
conference call linking the participants its part of a program 
developed by a manhattan agency that feeds and entertains elderly 
homebound people 
there are twiceamonth bingo games and monthly literary 
discussions a visit to italy is coming up in june mixed in are 
more serious topics such as safety tips from a policeman and hints 
on handling home attendants 
we have a lot of frail people living in fourstory walkups 
and other situations where participating in person is very hard 
says mrs gayle who picked up on the phone program after knee 
replacement surgery sidelined her 
mrs gayle is unique among the 70 senior citizens participating 
in the program she is a listener as well as a speaker shes one 
of the seniors who regularly checks out the you and your home 
attendant program as is mary hopkins 
they all seem to have the same problems all the girls said 
mrs hopkins a 69yearold shutin who joins the hookup about 
twice a week im grateful to have somebody to talk with 
the program is available to a limited audience the 350 
homebound elderly people served by the meals on wheels program 
operating on the east side of manhattan it began one year ago with 
four women playing telephone bingo said susan brown director of 
the program 
it was a brainstorm the technology was there we looked at 
the cost and saw it was doable she said we started out with 
bingo because it wasnt scary and they loved the idea 
how popular has bingobyphone become 
the other day a woman called me from her doctors office she 
wanted to make sure the appointment wouldnt conflict with her 
game brown said 
the seniors pay nothing the stanley m isaacs neighborhood 
center which operates meals on wheels pays 457 per person per 
hour to link the lonely brown said 
prior to each call the center sends participants background 
materials mrs gayles listeners received a packet of photographs 
of the sights she described members of the literary round table 
receive copies of short stories that will be discussed 
the teleconference begins after an operator calls each 
participant and hooks them on a single line brown acts as the 
moderator and each senior introduces themselves before the speaker

choosing a nursing home may be a bit easier 
with the new federal guide to nursing care quality but officials 
say theres still no substitute for a personal visalition 
for nursing home reform 
nonprofit nursing homes in michigan and iowa had found 
inaccuracies in the report parkin said its a matter of 
reputation and they are quite upset 
but morford said last months report is a big improvement over 
the first one and more changes are expected next year the new 
report includes more categories of care quality includes 
inspection reports for two years instead of one and shows which 
facilities have been penalized for failing to meet government 
standards 
the timing of inspections soon will be made more flexible so 
homes cant predict them morford said 
the reports will be used to monitor the effects of a major 
change in nursing home regulation enacted in 1987 which is 
gradually being implemented by hcfa this year 
the law allows new federal penalties to bring facilities into 
line imposes a training requirement for nurses aides and 
requires screening for patients mental health needs

in the university of massachusetts gerontology 
program where most students are over 60 classes tend to be noisy 
even rowdy 
theres often a lot of disagreement a lot of interaction 
said scott bass director of the program 
you can try to lecture and talk about theories but these 
students have actually been a part of these things and they have 
something to say said bass 40 
students say the twosemester program spares them struggling 
with the endless fine tuning of golf or tennis or the boredom of 
repeated visits to the beach more important they say is that it 
arms them with the knowledge to help societys vulnerable older 
citizens 
i never thought of retiring to florida said student betty 
francis i just want to keep busy if i believe in something i 
like to work with it and i want to work with the elderly 
bass said the 10yearold program at the universitys boston 
campus is specifically geared toward older students it examines 
the economic social and political issues that affect older people 
graduates receive a certificate in gerontological studies they 
can continue school work for human service agencies or elderly 
advocacy groups or volunteer to help older people 
the 45 graduates of the class of 1990 included retired social 
workers a nurse a priest and business people graduates ranged in 
age from 33 to 83 but most were over 64 
oh im excited ive enjoyed every minute of the program and 
now im ready to graduate said mary nowell 70 
a chance meeting with a frail elderly woman eight years ago 
prompted nowell to study the problems of the aging 
walking in the citys dorchester section she saw a woman in her 
80s struggling to carry a sack of groceries nowell helped the 
woman to her home a squalid tiny apartment the woman had little 
money no family and was plagued by ill health 
it was just like a hole in the wall very bad conditions 
nowell recalled i was shocked she had nobody 
what shook nowell most was that the woman who since has died 
was intelligent and educated 
she was a brilliant woman i didnt know what had happened to 
her nowell said but it wasnt for me to know why or how it 
can happen to anyone i just knew she needed help 
after she retired from her bookkeeping job last year nowell 
enrolled at umass she hopes to eventually get her bachelors 
degree 
in the fall term students examine the aging process from several 
angles physical emotional economic and political and each 
student spends time with an elderly invalid 
in the spring the class works together on a research project 
the students many who havent been to school in nearly 50 
years are often shy and nervous in the fall 
little things college students take for granted like filling 
in computerized registration forms can be intimidating for older 
people bass said 
but students quickly develop an animated rapport with teachers 
injecting theoretical discussions with generous doses of real life 
when we talk about state and federal programs for the elderly 
many of our students were around when they were conceived and they 
have a lot to say bass said their input is very rewarding for 
everyone

depressionera farmers are the last links 
with the sweat and joy of life on a small diverse family farm 
according to two people who plan to preserve those memories in a 
book called salt of the earth 
we wanted to go out indeed we felt compelled to go out 
and talk to these old guys said one of the authors teresa 
norrisphillips a freelance copywriter 
she and candis kelly a graphic designer have collected stories 
and photographs of nine illinois farmers ages 79 to 94 
among them is eli meiss who remembers a generation of farmers 
who ate the fruit and vegetables they grew churned butter from the 
cows they milked and carved hams from the pigs they raised 
we were selfsufficient meiss said today a farmers 
just like a poor city boy 
peter ropp recalls kerosene lamps for light horses for 
transportation and stoves for heat 
when returning from town on a cold night in a horsedrawn 
vehicle ropp said it was heartening to see the glow of the 
stove from the hill a halfmile south of home a real joy on a 
winter night to watch the yellow and blue flames play after the 
coal was added 
norrisphillips and kelly set out in january 1989 with tape 
recorder and camera uncertain of how two city women would be 
greeted 
we arrived at the door thinking why would they want to tell 
us their life stories kelly recalled wed walk out backward 
three hours later saying we really gotta go now 
the women listened and looked 
they stood atop james yontzs tall grain bins at san jose they 
looked at the faint traces of stagecoach tracks at dill seymours 
home near seymour 
rather than using set questions norrisphillips let the farmers 
reminisce and focus what mattered most to them 
meiss born in 1905 at fairbury began farming at the height of 
the depression in a year when drought and chinch bugs devastated 
his oats 
maybe starting in the 30s was good for us he said i 
cant say ive ever lost any sleep if i had a short crop but im 
always glad if i get more 
during interviews for the book kelly watched the farmers 
carefully to learn who they are visually and always included 
their hands in her blackandwhite portraits 
farmers who met with the women said they think their stories 
will be interesting perhaps even educational 
we lived in a different age said ropp 84 of normal it 
always helps to learn of the trials and tribulations of your 
ancestors helps people to deal with presentday problems

although sleep patterns may change over the 
years scientists know that restless sleep is not an inevitable 
part of aging 
in fact troubled sleep may be a sign of emotional or physical 
disorders and should be evaluated by a doctor or sleep specialist 
at any age there are some common sleep disorders tossing and 
turning all night is one example of isomnia but there are others 
taking more than 30 to 45 minutes to fall asleep waking up many 
times each night or waking up early and being unable to get back 
to sleep can mean you have insomnia 
with rare exceptions insomnia is a symptom of a problem not 
the problem itself 
snoring may be the sign of another sleep disorder sleep apnea 
in this situation the individual stops breathing for brief periods 
each night loud snoring coupled with daytime sleepiness may be 
symptoms of sleep apnea a doctor specializing in sleep disorders 
can make a definite diagnosis and recommend treatment 
unusual leg movements called nocturnal myoclonus or periodic 
movements of sleep also are common although scientists dont know 
what causes these leg movements sometimes medication can bring 
relief mild cases may be helped by leg exercises 
scientists researching sleep disorders have made some 
interesting discoveries for example dr charles czeisler and 
colleagues at brigham and womens hospital in boston and harvard 
university in a project funded by the national institute on aging 
report that the bodys internal biological clock is far more 
sensitive to light than previously thought 
in fact czeisler found that light may be the single most 
important factor in resetting this clock using this information 
czeisler and his colleagues have begun to treat some of the common 
sleeprelated complaints of their older patients 
other scientists are investigating the changes occurring in 
sleep and wakefulness as people age research also is exploring 
various treatments for sleep disorders and examining what the 
medical profession and the public need to know about good sleep 
practices 
however there are some things we already know 
follow a regular schedule go to sleep and get up at the same 
time each day 
try to exercise at regular times each day moderate physical 
activity two to four hours before bedtime may improve sleep check 
with your doctor before beginning any exercise program 
to adjust your internal sleep clock try to get some exposure 
to the natural light in the afternoon each day 
develop a bedtime routine do the same things each night to 
tell your body its time to wind down some people watch the 
evening news read a book or soak in a warm bath 
dont drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes to help you sleep 
drinking even small amounts of alcohol can make it harder to stay 
asleep smoking is not only dangerous the hazards of falling 
asleep with a lit cigarette but nicotine is a stimulant 
be aware of what you eat avoid caffeinated beverages late in 
the day caffeine is a stimulant if you like a snack before bed a 
glass of warm milk may help you relax 
after turning off the light give yourself about 15 minutes to 
fall asleep if you still are awake or lose your drowsiness get 
up and go into another room until you feel sleepy again 
try not to worry about sleep playing some mental games may 
help for example think black a black cat on a black pillow on a 
black sofa etc 
if you are so tired during the day that you cannot function and 
this fatigue lasts more than two to three weeks see a doctor for 
help locating a sleep specialist contact the association of 
professional sleep societies 604 second st sw rochester minn

candy on the cob thats the trend 
nowadays in garden corn but not everybody thrills to supersweet 
some preferring the oldtime flavor 
the raccoon isnt fussy unless you put up foolproof defenses 
hell get your best ears whether standard varieties like silver 
queen or the new saccharine entries with names like kandy 
korn how sweet it is xtra sweet and florida 
staysweet 
in this sugary scene breeders aimed at developing types of corn 
that stay sweet after picking 
as everyone knows standard corn turns to starch quickly hence 
the ritual of rushing freshpicked ears to the alreadyboiling pot 
before the sweetness fades the new varieties however can lie 
around as long as two weeks after harvesting and remain sweet a 
boon to agribusiness the supermarket road stands and perhaps the 
dentists office 
liking to try new things ive grown the ultrasweety but 
missed what my palate remebered as true corn flavor the ears 
tasted more like dessert than a vegetable course numerous such 
reactions from home gardeners have prompted the national gardening 
association to recommend that you try a few for taste before 
discarding old favorites 
fortunately most seed houses still carry silver queen a 
latematuring white variety that many of us regard as the best of 
the kind that you rush to the pot 
another oldtime star golden cross bantam is not so easy 
to find however ive spotted it in burpees catalog this year 
but the cover in line with the trend features a gorgeous color 
photo of two ears of a sugarextender called breeders 
choice said to stay sweet and tender on the stalk for at least 
10 days 
youve got to look sharply when ordering from a catalog for 
warnings that some supersweets need isolation from your standard 
corn otherwise crosspollination will produce tough starchy 
kernels of both types on the plus side some of the new ones are 
smaller no taller than 4 or 5 feet a welcome development for 
gardeners with limited space 
whether we opt now for extrasweet or standard corn takes a 
gardener centuries back to americas indian origins we celebrate 
the legacy with succotash the hearty corn and beans dish created 
long before nutritionists talked of balancing carbohydrates and 
proteins 
you plant corn in springtime when as they say young oak leaves 
are about as large as a mouses ears and start harvetsing in the 
full heat of the summer if youre a beginner be sure to plant at 
least two rows but preferably a block of four to insure good 
pollination without it the ears will turn out woefully short of 
kernels 
the old saying that you should grow enough corn for both you and 
the raccoon may be all right if you plant an acre but a gardener 
hoping for maybe 50 ears in a season may find his whole crop 
devoured by nightstriking masked bandits many gardeners 
unwilling to undertake the work and expense of securing the crop 
just give up on corn after such tragedies 
but ive fought back and can say with fingers crossed that 
ive frustrated the raccoon for several years now i credit mainly 
a batteryoperated hot wire that i strung atop my preexisting 
chicken wire fence 
the wire long used in livestock control delivers a harmless 
but memorable shock on contact and the raccoon thinks it over 
before trying again 
such fencers as they are called are available from garden 
supply companies hardware stores or horse equipment places i got 
mine from sears and did the job for a total of about 100 
living in the country at a distance from neighbors ive also 
installed in the garden a blinking light and a radio tuned to an 
allnight news station these are aimed at frightening deer as well 
as raccoons 
baiting the hot wire with strips of aluminum coated with 
peanut butter gives an inquisitive deer a jolt on the snout and it 
will stay away after that 
thats the theory anyhow and for me it beats going to 
barbershops for scraps of human hair another supposed deer 
deterrent i also have an enthusiastic helper a young shelty named 
lucy with fast feet and a sharp bark

peg obrien usually held her tongue when 
older women called the legal aid office for advice and then 
lamented that a young thing couldnt understand the woes of a 
60yearold widow 
but once in a while id say i do know said mrs obrien 
who was graduated in may from boston college law school im 
older than you are and im a widow 
mrs obrien turns 65 in august just how many people in her age 
group are taking up law studies is not known but the law school 
admissions services in newtown pa reported that the numbers of 
test applicants ages 40 to 49 nearly doubled from 198485 to 4160 
in 188889 
there are lot of secondcareer people but this woman is 
highly unusual kathy grove an attorney who is a consultant on 
legal education to the american bar association 
mrs obrien has been clearing paths most of her life she was 
among seven of about 70 girls in her high school class preparing 
for college 
after graduating from emmanuel college with a math degree she 
was hired by an insurance company and was told she was its first 
employee from a catholic womens college 
in 1980 mrs obrien became the first woman elected to the 
norwell board of selectmen 
after her husbands death in 1983 she took a paralegal course 
and went to work for an agency that provided guardian services for 
the elderly soon mrs obrien was thinking she could be a better 
advocate if she was a lawyer herself 
she took the law school admissions test on a lark telling no 
one the results were good so on another lark she applied to 
three boston law schools all three accepted her 
in the past few years boston college law school graduated two 
men in their 60s about 10 years ago a lawyers widow of similar 
age earned a law degree to take over his practice

doctors should worry more about older people 
who are underweight than those who are overweight according to a 
study 
the research by the johns hopkins school of hygiene and public 
health runs counter to many popular beliefs about weight gain the 
study of 4710 people found that overweight white women died at the 
same rate as those of normal weight death rates for overweight men 
were only slightly higher than they were among men in the normal 
weight range 
weight in and of itself is a relatively minor risk factor 
said dr matthew tayback coordinator of the johns hopkins center 
on aging 
if theres something to pursue as an unrecognized risk factor 
in the elderly we think its more important to look at low 
weight said dr shiriki kumanyika a former hopkins 
epidemiologist now at pennsylvania state university 
the results of the study appeared recently in the archives of 
internal medicine a publication of the american medical 
association 
dr richard sprott of the national institute on aging said he 
had not read the study but cautioned that it looked only at 
mortality and not quality of life 
being obese may not kill you but it sure makes it hard to 
play tennis he said 
the researchers found that death rates of overweight and 
optimumweight women studied were identical overweight men ages 65 
to 74 ran a 10 percent greater chance of dying 
in contrast underweight men and women in the same age group ran 
a 30 percent greater chance of dying 
obesity however should not be ruled out as a risk factor for 
younger americans said tayback who suggested that the overweight 
elderly may fare well statistically because people whose obesity 
contributes to fatal heart attacks die before they get old

donald trump has reached a tentative debt 
restructuring agreement with his bank creditors that would provide 
him with both money and time to mend his troubled empire a source 
familiar with the deal confirmed today 
the source who asked to remain anonymous said the banks agreed 
over the weekend to lend trump an additional 60 million and to 
suspend interest payments on 2 billion in debt

concerned that trump may not be able to handle the billiondollar 
debt he ran up buying big real estate and casino properties given 
the current slowdowns in both industries 
recent purchases such as the plaza hotel and trump shuttle 
airline have added to trumps financial woes because neither is 
reported to be making money 
trumps biggest bank creditors including citicorp chase 
manhattan corp bankers trust new york corp and manufacturers 
hanvover corp planned to discuss the weekend debt restructuring 
deal today with about 10 smaller creditors according to the source 
if any one of the other banks do not go along then the deal 
does not work the journal quoted on unidentified banker as 
saying 
bankers trust spokesman thomas parisi said he couldnt comment 
on the reported deal adding when an agreement is reached well 
probably release a statement 
other banks contacted had no immediate comment 
the source familiar with the negotiations said the major banks 
contributions toward the 60 million will be porportionate to the 
amount they previously lent with citicorp and bankers trust making 
up around twothirds of the new loan

grain and soybean futures prices were modestly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade as 
traders sold contracts in reaction to dry weather in the midwest

selling interest in the futures markets was tempered though by 
forecasts for rain in the region this week 
overall the market does seem to be finding some support here

president in the grain trading division of dean witter reynolds inc

the united states and mexico embarked today on 
a major effort to expand bilateral trade and investment agreeing 
to open talks on reaching a comprehensive free trade agreement 
president bush and mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
who met at the white house sunday night believe that a 
comprehensive free trade agreement is the best vehicle for 
forging a more vigorous partnership said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
the two presidents directed their trade advisers to open 
preliminary discussions with an eye toward concluding them before 
the next bushsalinas meeting in monterrey in december 
they agreed that the greatest possible mutual benefit would 
derive from an agreement that entails the gradual and comprehensive 
elimination of trade barriers and the fullest possible reduction of 
nontariff trade barriers 
bush and salinas see free trade as a powerful engine for 
economic development fitzwater said 
salinas met today with secretary of state james a baker iii and 
members of congress and planned to make a strong pitch for 
increased foreign investment tonight when he speaks to a gathering 
of top us business executives 
salinas initially was cool to the idea of a free trade agreement 
with the united states but now he says an economic takeoff in 
mexico will not be possible without it 
his change of heart apparently occurred after his efforts to 
seek foreign investment from europe fell far short of expectations 
mexico will not be left out of the new world configuration 
salinas said last month the speed of the changes requires 
decisive answers on all fronts in all markets 
twoway trade with mexico is about 52 billion a year but 
experts say there is potential for a substantial increase given 
the barriers to trade in both countries particularly mexico 
the agreement also could lead to substantially increased 
investment opportunities for us businesses in mexico 
if successful the trade negotiations could bring all of north 
america 335 million people into a single market free of tariffs 
and other barriers to trade the united states and canada entered a 
free trade agreement two years ago 
the pact with canada took four years to work out but salinas 
who was given a mandate by the mexican senate last month to 
negotiate a pact has said he hopes one can be concluded quickly 
the two leaders are hopeful that after preliminary discussions 
formal negotiations can begin by the time of the next bushsalinas 
meeting in december in monterrey mexico 
in both the united states and mexico organized labor has been 
worried that free trade could mean a loss of jobs but a recent 
report by the conservative heritage foundation said there would be 
no losers 
history shows that each economy would be helped by freer 
access to the other the report said 
the 42yearold salinas a harvardeducated economist is 
visiting here at time of unusual harmony in usmexican relations 
the lone setback recently was a usorchestrated kidnaping in 
april of a mexican doctor accused of complicity in the killing of a 
drug enforcement administration agent in 1985 
during the 1980s usmexican relations were marked by deep 
mutual suspicion because of differences over central america 
these days the crossborder mood is altogether different us 
officials have repeatedly praised salinas for his willingness to 
crack down on drug smugglers and for his efforts to modernize the 
mexican economy 
among other measures he has liberalized foreign investment 
regulations and begun selling resourcedraining state enterprises 
to private interests

corn and soybean futures prices gained monday on 
the chicago board of trade boosted by technically inspired buying 
after selling interest dried up early in the session 
wheat futures also advanced while oats finished lower 
analysts said many of the large speculators who sold corn and 
soybean contracts heavily last week returned monday as buyers 
which helped to lift prices to their highest levels in about two 
weeks 
buying enthusiasm was limited by perceptions that dry weather in 
the midwest will allow planting to advance although showers were 
expected to return to the region later this week 
william biedermann director of research for the commodities 
brokerage allendale inc said the corn market also was supported 
by expectations that an agriculture department report due out 
tuesday will confirm ideas that corn supplies are extremely tight 
in its weekly export inspections report released after the 
close the usda indicated an amount of soybeans inspected for 
shipment last week that was greater than the trade had expected 
at the close wheat futures prices were 1 cents to 4 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 332 a bushel 
corn futures were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with july at 289 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents lower with july at 147 a

australian treasurer paul keating said monday that 
his government would object to british publisher robert maxwells 
plans to take a 49 percent stake in the west australian newspaper 
maxwell plans to buy the holding from troubled australian 
financier alan bonds bell group ltd for the equivalent of about 
1925 million 
it amounts to a controlling interest which would run counter to 
the countrys laws on foreign press ownership keating said at a 
london news conference 
keating said the australian government has always taken a very 
strict view of newspaper ownership and would not agree to the 
sale as it now stands 
keating defined as controlling anything above a 25 percent 
interest he declined to comment further 
i am puzzled by mr keatings alleged remarks at the press 
conference in london today stating that australian law prohibits 
foreign ownership of newspapers with an excess of 25 percent 
maxwell said monday night to my knowledge no such legislation 
exists in australia 
maxwell added that it was injudicious of keating to comment 
before receiving mirror group newspapers application 
two years ago the australian government rejected a maxwell bid 
for the melbourne age 
under the deal announced earlier monday maxwell was planning to 
take a 49 percent stake in the west australian through his mirror 
group plc 
bell which also holds 49 percent of the perth daily news and 
several suburban newspapers was to retain a 50 percent share 
while an identified distinguished australian citizen was to 
hold the remaining 1 percent 
maxwell already holds a 149 percent interest in bell though 
the completion of the purchase is still pending a legal challenge 
by australias national companies and securities commission

foxboro co a leading maker of systems that 
control manufacturing processes said monday it is exploring what 
it called an alliance with other firms that could involve the 
sale of the company 
the announcement came amid speculation that began last week 
about a possible takeover of the company the talk drove up the 
price of foxboro stock which closed monsday at 30 a share up 
150 on the new york stock exchange 
a week ago the stock sold for 24 a share last year it traded 
as low as 1862 said albert turner a securities analyst at duff 
amp phelps in chicago 
foxboro systems are used to record and control processes in 
manufacturing such as temperature pressure humidity and liquid 
levels its customers are largely in the chemical and petroleum 
industries and include such familiar names as exxon corp and dow 
chemical co 
the international company based in the suburb of foxboro 
employs 7000 people the company reported a net loss for 1989 of 
46 million or 37 cents a share on sales of 598 million 
in a carefully worded announcement the company said it was 
exploring alternatives with respect to a possible strategic 
alliance with a limited number of firms 
such an alliance it said could add complementary strengths 
to the companys existing strong process control capability 
the deal it is exploring the company added could involve an 
equity investment in all or a substantial portion of its stock 
it also said however that no decision had been made on whether 
such a deal might even transpire 
telephone calls to john c fuller a member of the foxboro board 
and a vice president for investor relations were not returned 
foxboro would be an attractive buy turner said among its 
attributes are an old and loyal customer base and a new product 
line first offered two years ago that enables foxboro systems to be 
integrated with those of other companies 
but the new system has had costly bugs in it turner said 
its not clear that all of the problems have been completely 
worked out in this new system and this company has had to borrow 
money to finance its operations in the last four years turner 
said they could use a little financial backing 
robert sullivan an analyst at painewebber inc in new york 
said foxboro is coming out of a restructuring period 
the companys record in the last few years has been quite 
erratic which has led to some dissatisfaction on the part of some 
stockholders sullivan said 
its a big and growing market and as manufacturing companies 
are forced by law to reduce pollution one of the things they will 
be forced to spend money on is equipment to reduce pollution 
sullivan said

opportunities and will be more beneficial to the longterm 
interests of du pont and its customers and will strengthen our

waynesboro va there are about 725 employees divided between the 
two plants

to compensate victims of asbestosrelated diseases said monday it 
is exploring alternatives to ease a cash shortage that could delay 
some payments until the 21st century 
john c sawhill chairman of the manville personal injury 
settlement trust issued a statement that the trust wants to 
quickly resolve the current legal issues and return its attention 
to settling claims

including insurancetype deferred settlements investment and asset 
management options sale of part of its manville stock and 
borrowing money 
on friday a federal bankruptcy judge appointed new york 
attorney leon silverman one of the architects of manvilles 
reoganization plan to find ways of restructuring the 25 billion 
trust 
earlier this month a federal judge and a new york state judge 
ordered the bankruptcy court to overhaul the trust one change 
would be in a widely criticized payment method that compensates 
most claimants on the basis of when their lawsuit is filed 
the trust was criticized because of a cash shortage induced by 
more cases larger payouts and quicker settlements than expected 
it has said some claimants filing this year will not get paid until 
the year 2025 
the trust was formed as a separate legal entity in manvilles 
1988 reorganization six years after the denver company was driven 
into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over production of asbestos its 
main asset is ownership of a majority of manville stock 
the parties are talking about what can be done in this 
situation said theodore kleinman the trusts chief financial 
officer every possible alternative will be visited in the course 
of that exploration were very anxious to try to do whats right 
here 
manville was the nations largest maker of asbestos the 
insulation and building material found to cause severe and 
sometimes fatal illnesses manville to date has settled more than 
22000 claims by victims but still has more than 130000 pending 
in the statement the trust said it has received 958 million 
from manville and its insurers to date it said it has paid out 
739 million 638 million of that directly to claimants 
of some 219 million in cash on hand as of march 30 113 
million already is committed to paying claims over the next year 
the rest of the money is designated for prior settlement claims 
legal expenses and operations costs 
the trust has said it will have no new income until manville 
makes its first annual 75 million payment to the trust next year

korean air signed a 48 billion order monday 
for 23 boeing 747400s the thirdlargest order ever received by 
boeing co in terms of contract value 
the contract includes spare parts and training and commits 
korean air to more of boeings most sophisticated and 
highestcapacity jetliners than any other carrier except japan air 
lines jal has signed up for 40 of the worlds largest passenger 
jets 
the korean order is the third multibilliondollar purchase of 
boeing aircraft in as many weeks the others also were from asian 
air carriers a 2 billion order from the chinese government and a 
31 billion order from japan air lines 
boeing has received single orders for more planes but only two 
exceed the korean air order in dollar value an april 1989 order by 
irish aircraft leasing company gpa ltd worth 94 billion for 182 
planes and a 711 billion deal for 180 planes placed a week later 
by united airlines 
frank shrontz boeing chairman and chief executive officer told 
a news conference that the order reflects the fact that traffic 
growth in the pacific has been higher than in either the united 
states or europe 
he also said the 747400s which will be equipped to carry 392 
passengers each are best suited to meet the regions longrange 
flights and highcapacity needs 
korean air recently added longrange routes between seoul and 
moscow sydney toronto and vancouver 
korean air senior executive vice president ch cho said the 
airline also has contracts for eight other 747400s by 1994 it 
already has three in service 
cho said negotiations were under way to determine which engines 
the new planes would use he said korea produces some parts for the 
747 but the purchase is not dependent upon continued use of 
koreanmade items 
korean ambassador park tong jin said the purchase represented a 
sincere effort to reduce the countrys trade surplus with the 
united states 
boeing officials said 307 of the seattle companys 747400s have 
been ordered with 71 so far delivered to airlines around the world 
the 747400 can fly more than 8000 miles nonstop the planes 
normally sell for 116 million to 136 million each but officials 
said the korean air price reflects the estimated value of the 
dollar at the time of delivery
