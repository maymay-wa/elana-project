blue whales the largest animals on earth are 
closer to extinction than previously thought according to new 
studies that counted the seagoing behemoths rather than relying on 
estimates derived from whaling 
the report came during the annual meeting of the international 
whaling commission a private gathering of delegations from 38 
nations that ended friday 
recent estimates put the blue whales global population at 
between 6000 and 11000 but the new research based on an 
eightyear study in the southern hemisphere estimates the existing 
population at between 200 and 453 
where we are is far far worse than any of us had forseen 
said roger payne a research scientist for the world wildlife fund 
and a member of the whaling commissions scientific committee i 
now think that the question of whether blue whales will actually 
survive has suddenly come open again 
a worldwide ban on commercial whaling has been in effect since 
1986 leading some experts to conclude that numbers of the 
endangered whales might have increased 
but the new numbers call into question old population estimates 
and the procedure used to reach them earlier whale population 
estimates were made primarily from extrapolations based on the 
numbers of whales killed and sightings by whalers 
the commissions new count was derived from surveys in which 
specially assigned ships cruise the oceans and actually count whales 
sidney holt scientific adviser to the seychelles islands whaling 
commission delegation said latest reports also showed surprisingly 
low numbers of humpback sperm and fin whales 
the commission was formed by whaling nations in 1949 to ensure 
conservation of whales species and oversee management of whale 
populations last weeks meeting was closed to the news media and 
few official announcements were made 
three countries granted limited whale kills ostensibly for 
scientific purposes were urged by commission resolutions to reduce 
how many whales they planned to kill 
iceland bowed to commission pressure and promised to reduce the 
number of fin whales it would take in 1989 from 80 to 68 and said it 
would halt plans to kill 10 sei whales 
the north atlantic nation also promised to suspend all research 
whaling in 1990 
delegates also approved a resolution asking japan to rethink 
plans to kill 420 minke whales during 1989 and 1990 a similar 
resolution was passed asking norway to review its plans to slay 20 
minke whales for research in 1990 
neither country responded to the resolutions but japanese 
delegates were angry when the commission tabled a proposal to allow 
the commercial killing of 320 minke whales along its coast 
japans head delegate kazuo shima said he proposed the exemption 
from the worldwide ban on commercial whaling to alleviate the 
suffering of several coastal whaling communities he said have been 
devastated financially by the ban 
shima said in a written statement delivered to the commission 
that a membership split was present among commissioners pitting the 
prowhaling minority against the majority that favors strict whale 
conservation 
what has developed here is the dominance of the meateating 
culture over the fisheating culture shima said despite our 
great sacrifices and our efforts to ensure conservation we continue 
to be vilified by the meateating cultures because we hope some day 
to return whale meat to our diets 
but eiji fujiwara head of the japanese environmental group elsa 
nature said shimas arguments avoided the key issue 
this is not whether people eat whale meat or not fijuwara 
said the most important thing is to save the whales 
hundreds of environmental protesters staged demonstrations during 
the weeklong commission meetings on the final day of talks a huge 
replica of a blue whale was filled with air and placed outside 
meeting rooms

canada has reached agreement with 
four provincial governments industry and the united states to go 
ahead with the 366 million radarsat satellite prime minister brian 
mulroney said monday 
mulroney told a conference on science and technology that the 
radarsat program is an ideal illustration of a major step 
forward in canadas space effort 
the radarsat satellite to be launched in 1994 is designed to 
take radar images of the earths surface even in the dark and 
through clouds 
planners have said it will be used to provide information about 
ice conditions in the arctic and to help agricultural and forestry 
industries by detecting the humidity of soil and vegetation 
the radarsat program was announced in september 1987 but 
agreement was delayed because of disputes among the original 
partners canada britain the united states and four canadian 
provinces 
britain withdrew last year and in march ontario reduced its 
proposed contritution saying quebec was getting more than its share 
of work from the project the other participating provinces are 
saskatchewan and british columbia 
the radarsat program originally was to receive the equivalent of 
1736 million in canadian federal funds over a fiveyear period 
mulroney gave no details about the agreement saying they would 
be announced later 
a theme repeated at the conference was that canada does not spend 
enough on research and development and mulroney said much remains 
to be done 
he did not respond to a statement earlier in the day by ontario 
premier david peterson who said canadas investment in research and 
development should be raised to 25 percent of its gross domestic 
product the current level is 136 percent 
mulroney spoke of the responsibility of the private sector in 
financing research 
he said only 3 percent of canadas manufacturing firms have 
internal research and development capabilities and private sector 
support accounts for only 1 percent of the revenue for universities 
compared to seven percent in the united states

linus to the contrary the american childs 
favorite security blanket is the teddy bear 
thats the contention of dr paul horton a meriden conn 
psychiatrist who studied what he calls extraparental solacers 
or transitional objects and what the rest of us refer to as 
loveys or blankies 
one of four babies will choose a teddy bear as a transitional 
object horton told parents magazine 
in a study of 890 children between ages 5 and 13 horton and his 
colleagues found that 40 percent developed a close attachment to a 
stuffed animal twice as many as those who got their security from 
a blanket and of those who chose stuffed animals about six in 10 
chose teddy bears 
charles schulz creator of the cartoon strip peanuts told 
parents that he never had a security blanket but got the idea for 
linus famed blanket from his children 
in a telephone interview monday horton was asked why bears had 
their claws into the nations youth 
its been called a cultural fad but that doesnt explain it 
he said over the past 100 years children have been offered a lot 
of solaces stuffed lions giraffes and so forth but for some 
reason children prefer the teddy bear 
part of it may be that the bear is enough like a human for the 
child to relate to but different enough to distinguish it its 
ideally situated in psychological space 
a transitional object is part of the childs transition from 
total dependence on its mother to relative independence and is 
defined as the first thing a child turns to consistently for solace 
and comfort besides its parents or itself 
the chosen bear or blanket is usually soft and cuddly so much so 
that it soon becomes dirty and ragged often with a whiff of milk or 
some foulsmelling substance mothers tend to spend a lot of time 
cleaning or repairing transitional objects horton noted 
but as far as kids are concerned the loveys grunginess adds to 
its appeal its the childs own to do with as it wishes take it 
leave it keep it throw it away horton said 
although lovey is probably the most common lay term for the 
transitional object children themselves have come up with a wide 
range of alternatives jason azocar 5 of salem nh calls his 
blanket his gigi geegee while peter miller 5 of stratham 
nh prefers gaga gahgah peters older sister emily uses 
baba bahbah 
kids also fasten on a wide variety of transitional objects those 
that have been recorded by behavioral science include a scrub brush 
a potholder and a silk negligee in an extreme case an apparently 
domestically inclined child became attached to a vacuum cleaner and 
insisted it spend the night near his bed 
we never overcome our need for transitional objects they merely 
change from bears to gloves to jaguars sometimes they dont change 
at all horton said a study of 1200 students at the university of 
nebraska and cornell university found that of students who had 
stuffed animals 80 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys took 
their loveys with them to college 
my own son went to the university of minnesota and he took his 
old stuffed dog with him horton said it made him feel better

gerald gunther now a leading 
american law professor came back to his birthplace still 
remembering the nazi teacher who regularly called him a jewish 
pig in the 1930s 
as dozens of other west german towns and cities have done 
usingen invited its former jewish residents back a halfcentury 
after they were driven out by adolf hitler 
gunther now one of the foremost us experts on constitutional 
law was born in may 1927 in usingen about 20 miles north of 
frankfurt he started school there in 1933 the same year hitler 
came to power and began the harassment of jews 
the nazi insults particulary when they came from such an 
authority figure as a teacher left an indelible mark gunther said 
but at the same time they inspired him to excel 
i was only 6 when hitler took over in 1933 and i will never 
forget the nazi teacher who put us in the back corner of the 
classroom to separate us from the germans and called us jewish 
pigs gunther said in an interview 
because of this nazi teachers passion for drilling us with 
dates in german history such as when german kings were born i 
memorized those dates and was always first with my hand up to answer 
when i did that he would turn his back on me and say to the 
german kids how is it that this jewish pig knows the answers and 
you dont 
gunther stood as he talked in front of usingens former 
hugenotten church built in 1702 as a place of worship but used as a 
school from 1823 to 1965 
ironically i believe my passion for constitutional law and the 
division of power in government was born in that school because of 
the nazi insults gunter said 
he was born guenther gutenstein the son of otto and minna 
gutenstein and fled to the united states with his parents and 
brothers in september 1938 many of the 90 jewish residents of 
usingen had already left 
after arriving in the united states gunther learned english and 
went on to an engineering college that was followed by university 
law courses and he graduated second in his class from harvard law 
school 
gunther said he changed his name from gutenstein because my 
father felt a nonjewish sounding name would help me get a job in 
engineering but then i got involved in law 
he now teaches law at stanford university in california where he 
lives 
gunther is the author of the college textbook constitutional 
law which is used in nearly every us law school 
among those welcoming gunther and 18 other jews back to their 
hometown were an old german school friend mrs friedel preiss 
i always remember him as the cute chubby little guy with curly 
black hair she said 
the hair is thin and gray now but gunther repaid mrs preiss 
compliment with a kiss on the cheek as they stood near the site of 
usingens former synagogue where the visiting jews laid a wreath 
mrs preiss said german schoolmates were stunned by what the 
nazis did to drive out their jewish neighbors and friends 
after they left we always talked at home about them we always 
wondered if they were ok and where they were she said 
also in the group of former residents was laura duering 65 of 
san francisco her family name was rosenberg 
mrs duering said her family made apple cider and other fruit 
spirits in usingen which were delivered to restaurants as distant 
as sachsenhausen a part of frankfurt 
we had a german driver wilhelm kolte who was a very good 
friend of the family she said he would take the cider into 
sachsenhausen at night because it became illegal for restaurants to 
deal with jews 
she added that after her family had emigrated to the united 
states to escape the nazis kolte was drafted into the german army 
and taken prisoner in the soviet union 
my family wrote a letter to soviet officials to convince them 
kolte was not a nazi and they later set him free she said 
we were lucky because we could leave mrs duering said my 
husband rudolf escaped too but his mother and father died in 
auschwitz she said referring to the notorious nazi concentration 
camp in what is now poland 
stefan kolb a local high school teacher initiated the project 
to invite usingens former residents back home at the citys 
expense kolb said he had been working on it since 1980 after we 
decided to study about what happened to our former jewish residents 
as part of a history class 
usingen has a population of about 10500 the city allocated mark 
equivalent of about 70000 to bring its former jewish citizens back 
home 
many of the group of 19 jews from israel france and the united 
states were in their 70s and accompanied by their spouses and other 
family members for the weeklong visit

power was restored to downtown and residential 
areas early sunday after a blackout caused by an explosion in a 
transformer vault that also knocked out telephone operator service 
to parts of three states 
three utility workers were critically burned 
about 13000 volts of electricity were running through the 
underground equipment when a flash fire sparked the explosion 
forcing the evacuation of neighboring us west communications and 
atampt buildings officials said 
you can imagine thats pretty powerful assistant fire chief 
bill mcdonnell said of the voltage 
two of the victims who were in the vault at the time of the 
blast a man and a woman breathed in fire and were in very 
critical condition sunday at st joseph hospital in omaha nursing 
supervisor becke majors said the third worker a man was at 
another hospital in serious condition 
ruth howard a us west employee who was standing near the alley 
where the explosion occurred said two of the workers ran out of the 
alley engulfed in flames 
ive never seen anything like it before in my life she said 
their clothes were burned completely off and they were screaming 
for help 
kari eckert a private security guard who was one of the first 
people on the scene she said the injured woman yelled help me 
help me im on fire 
i turned around and i almost got sick ms eckert said i 
was scared to death

district said sunday the explosion saturday night knocked out power 
to the entire downtown area and about 350 square blocks of two 
residential neighborhoods 
power was restored to all areas by 415 am he said he said 
the number of customers who lost power was not known 
we may be able to ascertain a cause but sometimes it will take 
several weeks sometimes you never find out he said 
the problem is so much of the evidence burns up we may be able 
to get some information from the workers we just dont know he 
said 
fire chief robert warsocki said his department had completed its 
investigation and that any other information would have to come from 
the utility it was just an accidental electrical fire he said

switching unit for the telephone company 
gautier said power had to be turned off in parts of the us west 
building and the workers were turning the power back on when a 
flash started the fire and blast

were no operatorassisted calls for about three hours for atampt 
customers in all of nebraska half of south dakota and the western 
third of iowa a company spokesman said

late sunday editions and some metropolitan deliveries were delayed

this is the summer of the great rottweiler scare 
rottweilers are very large very ferocious dogs and one might 
imagine from recent headlines that they have britain under siege 
for a nation that cherishes its dogloving image its an 
unsettling experience and more than a simple dogbitesman story 
for weighty political and social issues are at play 
the trouble began in april when two rottweilers savaged and 
killed an 11yearold girl who was exercising them in scotland 
reports of rottweiler attacks have since filled the newspapers 
about 20 have been reported and they come with precise details 
down to the number of stitches required 
it seems as if the rottweiler dog is rapidly assuming the 
dimensions of the hound of the baskervilles commented the 
guardian newspaper 
indeed there are some similarities with sherlock holmes ghostly 
canine legend 
rottweilers are plenty scary they weigh about 130 pounds and are 
built like armored personnel carriers in britain their number has 
increased sevenfold to 180000 over the past decade 
with headlines blaring about devil dogs biting babies in 
their cribs the house of commons sat into the early hours of 
thursday debating the issue 
prime minister margaret thatchers own supporters rebelled and 
nearly defeated her on a motion to introduce doglicensing 
the conservative thatcherites oppose licensing wedded to a 
doctrine of getting government off the peoples backs they 
abolished the mandatory license two years ago 
now they say rottweilers or no rottweilers they wont bring it 
back 
it would be very very bureaucratic and very very hard to 
enforce says environment minister virginia bottomley 
peter jenkins a liberal newspaper columnist says that with this 
sort of laissezfaire attitude wed still have wolves on clapham 
common the park near his london home 
in a television debate liberal lawmaker paddy ashdown reeled off 
statistics to back his demand for a licensing scheme 500000 stray 
dogs roaming the streets of britain 250000 dog bites a year 
costing the public health system 26 million annually 
license fees he said would pay for more dog catchers and dog 
pounds 
the rottweiler set is aggrieved they have their own horror 
stories of rottweilers being poisoned in vengeance attacks of 
people being abused and threatened as they walk their rottweilers 
of plummeting prices for pups and of owners wanting to get rid of 
their rottweilers 
they blame the news media it appears a rottweiler has only to 
sneeze and it is in the headlines marilyn hayward of the british 
rottweiler association was quoted as telling the sunday times 
nothing it seems is safe the today newspaper described how 
policemen with pitchforks cowered on a tractor in orpington south 
of london while a rottweiler ran riot among a farmers prize pigs 
letters to the press offer various advice margaret jackson wrote 
in from chipping camden saying she found water pistols useful in 
fending off vicious dogs the rev roger reed of saffron waldon said 
dogowners like drivers should undergo a test before being allowed 
to have a rottweiler 
animal psychiatrists at cambridge university announced they would 
study the beast there is a serious problem with some animals and 
we hope to find out why said dr james serpell 
some observers think the popularity of these dogs is a reflection 
of the times they are effective protection against increasing 
burglaries and toughguy symbols for the rambo age 
we suspect theres a growing trend of people buying these dogs 
as a sort of macho status symbol said helen jessop spokeswoman 
of the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
rottweiler lovers like to say there are no bad dogs only bad 
owners that view replies the weekly economist resembles the 
slogan of the us antigun control lobby that guns dont kill 
people people kill people

a hot spell gave many television viewers an 
unexpected taste of foreign shores this weekend a newspaper 
reported today 
some watchers saw scandanavian television and others found 
themselves tuned into france as the heat and other unusual 
atmospheric conditions threw television signals out of kilter the 
daily telegraph said 
it said an atmospheric inversion that settled over britain caused 
signals to be reflected back to earth unpredictably in an 
atmospheric inversion temperatures rise in the upper levels of the 
air in contrast to normal conditions the paper said 
as a result viewers in eastern britain saw faint images from 
scandanavia and those in the south saw belgian and french 
television said the report 
it said roger fussell of devon picked up images from spain 
italy france sweden and east germany 
but the newspaper said fussell didnt mind the interruption that 
others might curse he belongs to a hamtelevision club whose 
members seek out odd and foreign programs 
all of britain enjoyed a mostly sunny weekend with temperatures 
in some areas reaching unusually into the mid80s in some areas

canadian tourists who keep cash 
registers jingling in this resort town also have vendingmachine 
operators singing the blues as lowervalued coins pile up 
starting shortly through the end of the season probably 8 or 
9 percent of the coins are canadian said paul dunn vice 
president and operations manager at donovan and donovan inc a 
vending company in nearby saco 
the nickels dimes and quarters are the same size as their us 
counterparts and at current exchange rates 119 canadian per 1 
us they can take a slow steady bite out of profits 
we have a pretty hefty discount when it goes to the bank 
dunn said coins we get discounted 50 percent the way its 
explained to us is its an expensive process handling them and 
shipping them back 
dunn said his company plans to install electronic devices to make 
machines refuse the canadian coins but that can create new problems 
of course that makes irate customers dunn said a few 
years ago it the exchange rate was 3 percent and we put in coin 
acceptors 
in northern maine hedrich vending inc of presque isle winds up 
with so many canadian coins that trying to keep them away would not 
be worth the effort said joe hedrich jr fixing the machines to 
reject the canadian coins would lead to too many jammed machines 
wed have service calls galore hedrich said we eat the 
discount 
up north the discount is not as bad with banks subtracting the 
actual exchange rate of around 20 percent in recent days he said 
but in southern maine banks are not fond of handling canadian 
coins 
for a customer of maine national bank we will discount it 50 
percent but for a noncustomer we will not do it at all said 
jim parisi head teller at maine national in downtown portland 
in old orchard beach a seaside town 20 miles south of portland 
the tourism economy gets such a lift from canadians that officials 
have decided to take the foreign coins at face value when they turn 
up in municipal parking lots and pay toilets 
as a courtesy we dont discount them town manager jerry 
plante said what limited number we get we process through the 
bank and we get discounted 40 percent 
vending companies that need to sift the canadian change out of 
the us coins have found that they can do so by running all the 
coins under special magnets which fish the canadian coins out said 
hendrich 
the canadian coins also turn up in parking meters some maine 
residents have found the meters to be a good place to get rid of 
canadian coins that turn up in their pocket change 
in portland parking meter supervisor robert henderson said the 
problem may be aggravated by businesses who buy the cheap coins and 
hand them out to let customers plug meters with them henderson said 
he cant prove the coins are being systematically used and he would 
not identify any suspect businesses but hes gotten reports for 
several years of the practice

the japanese may appear to be the worlds most avid 
consumers of luxury goods but they are just as enthusiastic about 
stashing money in the bank 
the countrys 39 million households each held an average 191 
million yen equivalent to about 132450 in personal savings last 
year according to a recent bank of japan report 
total personal savings rose 114 percent to 518 trillion in 
1988 and accounted for more than half the total value of japans 
goods and services outpacing growth in consumer spending which 
surged 45 percent 
it was the third year that personal savings deposited at banks 
and postal offices or held in stocks bonds and insurance posted 
doubledigit growth over the previous year 
it also is a clear indication that the japanese have not 
abandoned their habit of saving a substantial part of their incomes 
japanese save 16 percent of their income on average compared to 
about 55 percent in the united states 
the bulk of personal savings in japan 445 trillion is held 
in bank and postal deposits and in bonds and insurance the 
remainder in stocks 
however savings figures exclude important assets such as real 
estate and therefore understate the wealth of many japanese families 
homeowners in tokyo for example held real estate worth an 
average of 596393 in 1987 according to the governments economic 
planning agency 
likewise the lower savings rate in the united states understates 
the wealth of american families which is mainly held in housing 
says richard c koo senior economist at nomura research institute 
japanese savings mainly are in financial assets he says that 
creates a massive pool of capital for japanese industry 
while the value of land in japan tends to appreciate housing 
actually depreciates people know that their houses will not be 
worth much 10 years from now so they dont invest in housing koo 
said 
americans put their savings into keeping their homes up 
because they expect them to appreciate he explained 
housing in japan is vulnerable to earthquakes and fires and 
traditionally is torn down and rebuilt rather than maintained 
numerous surveys say the japanese save to prepare for illness and 
disaster for retirement and childrens educations 
ive always stashed whatever i could in the bank so id have a 
nice nest egg said seitarou komatsu 41 an employee of a major 
japanese industrial firm its my security that way i can relax 
and not worry 
the prospect of long years of retirement is a crucial reason 
average life expectancy in japan is 821 years for women and 759 
years for men while the mandatory retirement age at many companies 
is 5560 
the japanese are much less confident about the future than 
americans said koo they know how much things cost here and 
theyre wise to prepare for their old age 
but how do they do it 
the expansion of twoincome families has contributed to the 
growth in personal savings along with rising values of financial 
assets 
the average monthly wage for a japanese worker in a company with 
30 employees or more about half of japans work force of 44 
million is about 2329 while spending averages 2080 a 
household

rhythm and blues singer etta james would love for 
her new album sticking to my guns to win a grammy even though 
shes still upset about the way her last album was treated 
ms james who will perform friday at a dallas blues festival 
said she was hurt when her album seven year itch was shunted to 
afternoon ceremonies instead of being included among the primetime

finished 
ive been practicing all week i thought the quickest way was 
to eat all around the ear but i didnt expect to win she said 
winning the spitting contest with a distance of 16 feet 2 
inches was an even bigger surprise 
i really dont know how i won this one she said i never 
spit 
but even though she didnt expectorate to win and did anyway it 
was a close contest jane montgomery 50 had earlier sent a seed 16 
feet 1 inch after soaking it in beer

as important elections loom charges that prime 
minister sousuke uno paid a geisha to be his mistress are drawing 
angry roars from women and could alienate more voters from the 
scandaltainted governing party 
personally i think that if the report is true he should 
resign says kii nakamura spokeswoman for the 1million member 
housewives association 
it could come to us pressing for that but we wont decide what 
course of action to take until he explains himself 
ms nakamura said her group and 51 others representing most major 
japanese womens organizations will submit a letter to uno 
demanding he confirm or deny the report and explain his feelings 
toward sex as a product you can buy 
among those calling for uno to step down are such diverse groups 
as the japan communist party and a national antiprostitution 
organization headed by a former legislator 
he is not qualified to hold such an office the 
antiprostitution group said in a statement 
chairwoman michiko matsuura of the 5000member league of women 
voters said overall the status of women is moving in the right 
direction but what worries us is that the scandal involves the man 
at the top the man with ultimate responsibility for enforcing the 
laws that guarantee womens rights 
according to the report published soon after uno became prime 
minister on june 2 an unidentified 40yearold woman said uno paid 
her 2100 a month to be his mistress for four months in 1985 
he is not a man of noble character the woman allegedly told 
the respected weekly magazine sunday mainichi i dont want him to 
use politics the same way he treated me 
uno has avoided replying to opposition lawmakers questions in 
parliament on the subject saying he will not comment publicly on 
personal matters as the assemblys rules permit 
we were shocked when we heard the questioning in the 
parliament session said a joint statement from the league of 
women voters the japan nurses association and five other 
organizations representing 6 million women the prime minister 
must clearly and honestly answer to the charges 
dalliances of public officials often have been ignored by the 
media but chief editor shuntaro torigoe said his sunday magazine 
published the article to bring social ethics into the public arena 
the latest scandal comes as the liberal democratic party which 
has run japan for 34 years struggles to regroup after the 
resignation of prime minister noboru takeshita who left office 
because of links to an influencepeddling scandal that has involved 
much of the governing elite 
uno is considered a weak politician but the party chose him 
because of his unblemished reputation after another scandalfree 
party elder refused the post 
analysts say party leaders had hoped uno would polish the partys 
image before late july elections for half the seats in the upper 
house of parliament but matsuura told the associated press that 
strategy may have backfired 
most women and i think most men are concerned with his 
conduct she said noting more than half of japans 889 million 
voters are women his handling of this affair will be reflected at 
the polls 
standing to benefit most is the biggest opposition party the 
socialists whose popular leader takako doi is the only woman at the 
helm of a major party ms doi has not commented on the scandal 
though a female socialist legislator was the first to raise it in 
parliament 
the masscirculation asahi shimbun newspaper has quoted one of 
unos campaign officials as saying the scandal is irrelevant 
however unos administration will lead the liberal democrats to 
elections with the lowest support rating registered by a new 
government 22 percent according to a poll by mainichi shimbun 
japans thirdlargest newspaper 
political analyst and author asao yamaguchi says changing 
attitudes toward women may have helped the scandal snowball but 
more important is a general feeling of distrust toward politicians 
engendered by the influencepeddling affair 
if it was only a sex scandal male voters might not have 
cared yamaguchi said but uno didnt foster much confidence from 
the start and this just adds to the dissatisfaction

miners at the pittson coal groups only active 
mines in kentucky walked out early monday joining a bitter strike 
by an estimated 20000 coal miners in six states 
on sunday about 4000 people attended a solidarity rally in 
waynesburg pa near the west virginia line the labor union has 
been asleep but this sleeping giant has awakened said ed 
yankovich incoming president of united mine workers district 4 
miners began walking off their jobs in southern west virginia at 
the beginning of last week in support of the strike against 
pittston by monday the walkout had spread to pennsylvania 
indiana virginia kentucky and tennessee 
umw president richard trumka on sunday called a strike by about 
200 miners at three eastern coal corp mines in eastern kentucky 
near the west virginia border the only active pittston holdings in 
that state the walkout began at 1201 am monday 
everyone feels it was long overdue said terry varney a 
spokesman for umw local 5737 were glad to finally be joining the 
others on the picket line morale is high and with solidarity we 
feel we can beat pittston 
boyd vance a miner on strike near the guyandotte river in 
southern west virginia expects the wildcat strikes to spread 
further then if coal production still isnt stopped hell start 
looking out for trouble 
i believe in being able to express myself peacefully in a 
nonviolent way but there are others out there who at the drop of 
the hat will kill you for what they believe in vance said 
two people have been killed in umw strikes in recent years a 
nonunion truck driver caught in sniper fire in 1985 and a striking 
miner shot by a guard in 1978 
the union has been on strike against pittston in virginia and 
west virginia since april 5 because it hasnt had a contract since 
february 1988 two judges in virginia have jailed three strike 
leaders and fined the union millions of dollars 
though the union leadership denies orchestrating the walkouts at 
mines other than pittstons which violate the contract trumka last 
week urged miners to return to the fighting spirit they had in the 
1970s 
if i was working for the mine workers id go after trumkas 
scalp pittston spokesman bill byrne said 
west virginia once was the nations largest coal producer but 
wildcat strikes in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s are 
blamed for reducing production and sending coal customers elsewhere 
kentucky and wyoming now lead the nation west virginia is third 
all this puts west virginia in a position of being an 
unreliable supplier said gary white president of the west 
virginia coal association we had that situation in the 1960s and 
1970s with all the instability 
our customers are wondering if this is the beginning of that 
type of pattern 
the expiration of contracts between the umw and the bituminous 
coal operators association prompted nationwide strikes in 1971 1974 
and 1977 
but scores of smaller impromptu strikes took place for reasons 
ranging from lost time because of a flood 3000 miners struck for 
a week to cuts in medical benefits 70000 miners out for six 
weeks 
the umw leadership has denied ordering the current wildcat 
im not aware of any order from the union dictating that our 
members walk off the job umw spokesman joe corcoran said 
saturday the miners have walked off the job and in most cases 
have articulated both anger and frustration at the heavyhandedness 
of the virginia courts imprisonment of strike leaders and fines 
but in birmingham ala umw district 20 international board 
member tommy buchanan said friday that it was up to trumka whether 
alabama miners walk out it will start whenever it comes down from 
the union president he said 
at the heart of the current walkout is the contract dispute with 
pittston but pittston last week declared negotiations at an 
impasse which allowed it to implement its latest contract offer 
federal labor law requires umw leaders to present that offer to 
their members 
miners anger also is aimed at the two judges who have fined the 
union 3 million for peaceful demonstrations and jailed three men 
for continuing civil disobedience 
everyone would have been working right now if that judge had 
not stepped in and put that kind of fine and penalty on the union 
said john vance a newly elected rankandfile board member and 
ashland coal miner 
boyd vance who is no relation to john vance said the pittston 
situation is makeorbreak 
theyre going against everything weve ever had if we let 
pittston get away with it then all these other companies will come 
up and say we know the route lets take it he said

hes just been appointed to a big job in 
washington assistant deputy undersecretary for something he 
figures hell have the presidents ear from time to time be invited 
to state dinners he might call a quick press conference to lay out 
his agenda 
one can almost hear the sound of expectations deflating in this 
anecdote published in a new manual for people new to washington 
i expected a briefing by the white house on what life would be 
like in washington i expected someone to consider my family and say 
hey heres 10 realtors and heres the country club heres the 
schools for your kids and heres some people that would like to meet 
your wife and heres the synopsis from the transition team on how 
to do things 
well i never got any of that it was sink or swim pal 
the teller of that tale is a former government appointee who 
appears along with dozens of others anonymously in a 
survivors guide for government executives subtitled how to 
succeed in washington 
it was written by john h trattner a former journalist and 
diplomat based on interviews with members of the center for 
excellence in government the center is a nonpartisan organization 
of some 400 business leaders who have held appointed policymaking 
or management jobs in government some as far back as the 
administration of franklin d roosevelt 
they were asked for their insights to help those who are about to 
do what they had done move from private life into a high federal 
post 
a repeated theme is that the new appointee would be wise to know 
and use the existing bureaucracy the civil servants who were there 
before him and will be after he leaves 
dont try to do it all the appointee is advised dont be 
afraid to use existing mechanisms build esprit and morale 
remember that staff are there to help you 
much of the advice is common sense but some is eyecatching 
reading it conveys a sense of what it must be like to come to 
washington to work for a president and for a boss one doesnt know 
while leading an unknown staff and having to face congress press 
and constituency with answers right from the start 
here are some samples with backup comments from the 
exgovernment officials drawing on their own experiences 
keep in constant touch with your interest groups an 
exofficials comment one temptation the political appointee has 
to resist is staying in the office and listening only to an 
elite cadre of special assistants youve got to go out youve got 
to have lunch with the lobbying groups even though you dont 
have enough time to get everything done as it is 
youre not being invited in for an ego trip the comment 
be sure you know that the government is very big and your piece 
is going to be only a part of it the president isnt going to wake 
up every day and wonder where you are 
its government by committee get used to it even routine 
decisions in washington are usually drudged over by several 
agencies weeks months even years can go by while a decision 
stumbles through successive phases of research and laborious 
negotiation 
know when not to compromise the quote you have to have 
the patience to hear them out then wait them out then stall them 
out and finally say no the patient intellectually honest stall is 
one of the great government ploys 
control your inbox dont let it control you the quote 
every day i came in there were three inboxes and then there were 
four inboxes and so on so i used to just leave them and if 
something was important enough somebody would eventually come into 
my office and say something like did you get that memo i sent you 
several months ago it was real important we ought to get on that 
and we would 
learn from the professionals the quote there is almost 
always one person whos been around for a long time knows all 
the bodies if you can find that man or woman and befriend them 
and get them to give you the real kind of inside skinny on whats 
going on thats very helpful youve got to find the intelligence 
network inside the system 
no precaution is too small or too troublesome the quote 
for gods sake dont lie to people dont let somebody pay for a 
300 hotel room dont accept gifts dont let people buy you 
lunches 
trattner said it was exhilarating to listen to the former 
officials 
their experience signals the continuing vitality and challenge 
of the political system they embody he said it is a system 
whose uniqueness rests in part on the ability to spur experienced 
and intelligent men and women to place their talents for a time at 
the service of the nation

capitol hill has a little secret one that has 
caused some to dub congress the last plantation 
when congress passes laws affecting the rights working 
conditions health and safety of hundreds of millions of american 
workers it routinely exempts itself and the thousands of people who 
work for it 
most american employees are ensured that their basic rights will 
be protected by law that standard occupational health and safety 
regulations will be observed that they can expect to earn at least 
a minimum wage that they cannot be discriminated against because of 
race sex or age 
but the word most does not apply to workers in the marble 
halls and utilitarian kitchens and basements of congress 
it is a little known fact says sen john glenn dohio 
that both the senate and the house have exempted themselves from 
provisions of federal law passed by congress in these areas 
a double standard is established when congress passes 
legislation for the rest of the country and then exempts itself 
glenn said 
glenn commented last week as he and sen john mccain rariz 
introduced legislation intended to give most congressional workers 
the same employment protection enjoyed by other americans 
he quoted the late sen sam ervin dnc as saying the 
congressional practice of avoiding the laws it passes for others 
looks like a case where the doctor is prescribing medicine for his 
patients that he himself will not take 
i agree with that statement glenn said i believe this 
medicine is good for both the patient and the doctor 
glenns medicine is designed to get around two obstacles 
one is the traditional reluctance of congress to put its 
activities and practices under the jurisdiction of the executive 
branch 
it would be a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers 
to permit congress to be judged by an equal branch of government 
many house and senate members contend 
the other is the preference of many members of congress to hire 
staff members from their own states and most of the time from 
their own political parties 
the glennmccain bill addresses both sticking points perhaps 
making the medicine a little easier to swallow 
in the first place it places the mechanism for policing 
enforcement of the laws inside the legislative branch itself by 
creating a congressional employees relations office to do the job 
secondly it makes a concession 
if a senator from wisconsin for example wants to hire only 
wisconsin natives to serve on his staff he could do so under the 
terms of the bill 
and if a member of congress wanted a purely partisan staff he or 
she would have that right 
however it should be made very clear that those persons who 
prepare and serve our food who maintain these picturesque grounds 
around the capitol who repair our office furniture and who work 
generally in a nonlegislative capacity should have the same kind 
of protection that their counterparts in the executive branch and 
private sector have glenn said it is only fair 
and fair glenn said is one thing the present situation is not 
while congress has a policy of recruiting minorities and women 
he said blacks number no more than 50 in the ranks of 2500 top 
professional staffers 
women have done only slightly better he said less than 20 
percent of the top jobs in the senate are held by females while 80 
percent of the lowestpaying jobs are reserved for female 
employees 
specifically the bill would mandate the provisions of such laws 
as the civil rights act of 1966 the fair labor standards act of 
1938 mandating a minimum wage the age discrimination in employment 
act of 1976 the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and the 
rehabilitation act of 1973 
mccain said congress has enough problems at the moment without 
exempting itself from laws that eliminate bias and discrimination 
continuing the double standard he said can only further erode 
the confidence of the american people in their government

its that time of the year when the agriculture 
departments bug writers turn out reports about the creepy crawly 
hoppy things that chew on crops and livestock 
some of the reports turned out by specialists in the departments 
agricultural research service involve spaceage technology foreign 
entomological recruiting and even sex one of the favorite weapons 
of pest managers 
and when a fierce insect predator attacks a lace bug well 
the details arent for small children 
take the common grasshopper a notorious villain with an appetite 
for almost anything in the plant world or nematodes ticks weevils 
and sundry other kinds of critters that make farmers ranchers and 
home gardeners fret 
grasshoppers like to sit in the sun says usda research 
entomologist raymond i carruthers if its cold a grasshopper 
cant develop quickly it might not develop to adulthood at all 
during its growing season from may into september 
dont feel sorry for the hopper though millions of them chew on 
pastures each year destroying almost a fourth of the forage grasses 
in 17 of 22 western states and migrating grasshoppers also ravage 
potatoes alfalfa and other crops 
the internal body heat of the sunloving hoppers serves the 
insects another way by protecting them against certain diseases 
for example carruthers said one fungus entomphaga grylli would 
show promise as a biological control if it could stand the heat 
carruthers said the fungus can stand about 100 degrees fahrenheit 
for six to eight hours before starting to die grasshoppers in 
laboratory tests have been shown to actually cure themselves by 
basking in the light he said 
but a type of e grylli from australia can stand greater heat 
exposure and may be introduced on western rangeland as early as this 
summer carruthers said 
in parts of texas and other rangeland areas of the west 
snakeweed and other unwanted brush is a costly and persistent 
problem for livestock producers maybe two south american insects 
will help 
a weevil named heilipodus ventralis and a moth called carmenta 
haematica attack the roots of snakeweed a plant that infests 143 
million acres in western states 
entomologist jack deloach who works for the usda agency in 
temple texas said federal approval has been granted to introduce 
the weevil into the united states but the moth is still being 
tested he said 
agency scientists are looking at biological controls for brush 
because chemicals are too expensive in areas where it takes 20 to 50 
acres to provide grazing for one cow for a year he said 
besides snakeweed which can cause pregnant cows to abort 
targeted brush includes saltcedar which infests about a million 
acres along western streams and baccharis a willowlike shrub 
found from florida to california 
other possible brush enemies are being looked at including some 
from argentina and brazil and at least a dozen insect species from 
asia 
but sometimes a natural ally shows up no farther away than a 
potted azalea at the usdas main research center in beltsville md 
in this case it was a natural enemy of lace bugs the most serious 
enemies of azaleas 
entomologist john w neal and colleagues discovered an insect 
predator stethoconus japonicus in 1985 on a usgrown potted 
azalea studies since have shown that a single female predator 
which has a needlelike snout can consume five or six lace bugs 
each day the slightly smaller male handles two or three 
the lace bug doesnt have a chance neal said the predator 
sidles up undetected and gives its unsuspecting victim a lethal 
injection through its long needlelike mouth holding onto the lace 
bug with front legs the predator then withdraws all body fluids and 
tissue leaving an externally intact but completely drained shell 
down in the caribbean researchers have released 56 million 
hybrid cattle fever ticks on st croix island in the us virgin 
islands to see if they might be used to keep cattle tick fever from 
spreading into the united states along the usmexico border 
the hybrid male ticks are sterile and do not produce sperm said 
entomologist ron davey the females are fertile but pass on the 
sterility to male offspring the result is a population crash 
he said 
cattle fever or babesiosis kills up to 80 percent of adult 
cattle that are infected by it all us breeds are susceptible 
davey said but humans do not get cattle tick fever and are not 
bitten by the ticks 
one of the most encouraging bits of news for many soybean farmers 
is a new bean variety that could be available next year the 
variety cordell will be the first commercial soybean resistant to

she hits her textbooks every day looks forward to 
classes resuming and is not on the wanted list but this university 
student lives in constant fear police will come looking for her too 
i have nightmares every night she says her features 
tensing in these dreams they always come to arrest me 
this 20yearold was not a main organizer of the studentled 
democracy protests that ended in the bloody onslaught by chinese 
soldiers this month 
she is not in hiding and she is not trying to perpetuate the 
movement for democratic reforms a free press and an end to 
corruption 
but she had been deeply involved in the movement that began in 
midapril reading speeches on her schools loudspeaker system 
spending considerable time with student protesters in tiananmen 
square and handing out leaflets 
she also took part in the hunger strike that focused world 
attention last month on the few thousand young people occupying 
tiananmen when supporters swelled the number to 1 million 
for these reasons she asked that neither she nor her school be 
named though she agreed to speak privately with a reporter in a 
secluded location she said she wanted to talk about what she saw 
and experienced events the government has spent the last week 
vigorously denying 
i saw where two people had been run over by a tank the bodies 
were gone but some of their insides were still there recalled 
the student from a prominent beijing university 
she was filmed at the scene by soldiers with video cameras near 
tiananmen the night of june 3 when the army moved in behind 
automatic weapons fire tanks and armored vehicles 
i saw many many people wounded and taken away on flatbed 
tricycles she said when they shot at us we just dove for the 
ground id only seen that in movies before 
she is worried also because she has been interviewed on american 
and european television networks after the crackdown chinese 
television showed footage shot by a us television network of a man 
saying thousands were killed at tiananmen 
the television commentator called him a rumormonger and 
within hours he had been captured and was shown humbly recanting his 
account the government has said 300 people were killed in the 
assault mainly soldiers 
independent estimates have put the death toll at up to 3000 
most of them unarmed civilians 
the student noted that many compare the current crisis to the 
dreaded 196676 decade of communist revolutionary turmoil when 
workers soldiers and students took the law into their own hands and 
central authority collapsed 
in the cultural revolution mao tsetung pitted the people 
against themselves she said deng xiaoping the current senior 
leader cannot do that today the people are united against 
dictatorship and corruption 
her father an intellectual recently talked with her about the 
terrors of the cultural revolution he didnt want to tell me for 
several years because he wanted me to stay pure she said but 
now he has to tell me because he thinks it is very dangerous for me 
with my character because i show my anger and show what i think 
her father told her how many of his friends were arrested because 
of just one or two sentences in their diaries or letters that were 
perceived as counterrevolutionary 
my father told me not to write a diary she said if the 
police find it ill be arrested 
her diary bears no entries this month for june 36 i was too 
shocked to write anything now i write that im suspicious of the 
party and socialism i used to think socialism was the only correct 
way because we were taught so we were taught that the party belongs 
to the people but now im suspicious of socialism im antiparty 
despite her outspokenness she says she is not trying to escape 
you cant hide if you go to the provinces and if they want to 
find you they will my father wanted me to go to my aunts home in a 
northeastern province but i wouldnt go my father has calmed down 
he just wants me to shut my mouth and stop writing 
she acknowledges the prodemocracy movement is snuffed out and 
may not return for years 
a friend thinks it will be one or two years after dengs death 
but i think things will stay the same after that she said 
there are other old people in the central committee 
she referred to the influential octogenarian revolutionaries in 
the communist party leadership whom deng is believed to have lined 
up behind his hardline policy against dissent 
the chinese government is too powerful the student said 
they use the army and guns 
last week she and other students put on white shirts with black 
armbands to mourn their fallen classmates 
but a student told us it was very dangerous to wear that that 
some people had been arrested for it he said lets keep our 
sorrow in our hearts she said 
its very tiring to be chinese to try and protect yourself to 
hide your feelings hide your thoughts she sighed i cant bear 
the atmosphere you must be careful about everything its 
frightening

chinas bestknown journalist liu binyan 
predicts the current chinese government will last no more than two 
years because of public anger over the countrys serious economic 
problems 
liu who was expelled from the ruling communist party in 1987 for 
reporting on government corruption says he will not go back to 
china soon because he probably is on the hardline governments 
wanted list 
i did not consider myself a dissident but the situation made 
me become one i did not consider myself to be in exile but it 
seems like i have to be in exile he told a news conference sunday 
liu arrived in hong kong from the united states on saturday at 
the invitation of the hong kong journalists association 
he said the government will fall because of the economic crisis 
and the political impact it has already caused 
he said people in cities are angered by mounting inflation and 
farmers are upset at low grain prices this anger will mushroom as 
news of the june 34 massacre in beijing spreads throughout the 
country he said 
the leaders might not live that long because they are thinking 
of dealing with the people all day he said 
the present government has much less credibility than mao but 
the pressure from the people it is facing is ten times stronger than 
what mao tsetung had he said late chinese ruler and the 
196676 cultural revolution that mao inspired 
i dont believe there will not be any changes in chinas 
leadership in the next two years he said 
despite the bloody crackdown he said the studentled 
prodemocracy movement succeeded because it was the first time in 
40 years that students represented the people and showed their 
discontent with the government to the whole world 
among the hundreds of thousands of students the first and 
second generation of political leaders are growing and they are 
maturing quickly 
chinese are not the same as in they were in 1949 they are more 
politically mature and will not be fooled he said 
liu 64 wrote for the official communist party newspaper 
peoples daily before he was expelled for attacking the party and 
marxism 
he went to the united states in march 1988 and taught at the 
university of california at los angeles then went to harvard 
university on a nieman fellowship 
he was one of three prominent intellectuals ousted in a party 
campaign against supporters of western ideas the others are writer 
wang ruowang and astrophysicist fang lizhi 
fang and his wife li shuxian have taken refuge in the us 
embassy in beijing wang is believed to be in china but his 
whereabouts are unknown 
liu said authorities probably would kill fang or student leaders 
if they caught them 
they are not kind they are cruel hyprocritical and would use 
any means to achieve their aims

writer if stone who throughout his fiery 60year 
career took on the political establishment was remembered upon his 
death as journalisms rock of gibraltar and its unwavering 
conscience 
he died early sunday at age 81 of cardiacrelated difficulties 
said brigham and womens hospital spokesman mike macdonald 
isador feinstein stone widely known as izzy devoted 18 
years to publishing the muckraking newsletter if stones weekly 
everette dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies at columbia university said stones newsletter became 
a guiding force for a generation of journalists and activists 
he was an aberrant voice for a long time but he became a 
folk hero said dennis who included a chapter on stone in his 
book other voices the new journalism in america 
stone born dec 24 1907 in philadelphia attributed his 
independent political spirit to his father a general dry goods 
store owner in haddonfield nj 
despite his reputation as a gadfly stones dogged pursuit of 
facts and his refusal to pander to any political faction won him 
respect he lost 400 readers after a 1956 report from the soviet 
union in which he said workers there were more exploited than those 
in the west 
but he delighted in caustically attacking american conservatives 
he once called ronald reagan the tv tarzan of republican 
politicos 
stone who lived in washington spent his career pouring through 
government documents and challenging the status quo he pressed for 
civil rights and was an early critic of us involvement in vietnam 
he invented a kind of investigative reading said victor 
navasky editor in chief of the nation every week in his if 
stones weekly he would find things in the congressional record that 
other people had not seen or didnt understand the significance of 
but he would and those items would frequently be frontpage news 
stories 
initial subscribers to the weekly founded in 1953 included 
albert einstein bertrand russell and eleanor roosevelt by 1971 
when it had become a biweekly 70000 subscribed 
for over 50 years he was both journalisms rock of gibraltar 
and its unwavering conscience said ralph nader the consumer 
advocate and close friend while others in his profession cowered 
he stood to challenge the abusers of power wherever they came from 
izzy set a standard to which all journalists should adhere it 
was one that all public malefactors abhorred said john kenneth 
galbraith the harvard university economist 
during stones long career his investigative reports included 
the 1956 discovery that nuclear tests could be detected thousands of 
miles away a revelation that proved crucial to the debate over 
whether a test ban could be verified 
the roots of stones activism can be traced to his teenage 
years when he became an avid reader authors such as jack london 
and prince peter kropotkin the russian anarchist turned him toward 
political radicalism he said 
when stone was 14 he and another youth published the 
progressive a 5cent monthly that supported gandhi and the league 
of nations they had 500 subscribers he also became a reporter for 
the haddonfield press and a correspondent for the camden 
courierpost 
after attending the university of pennsylvania he spent his 
early career reporting for among others the philadelphia inquirer 
and the new york post before moving in 1938 to an editorship and 
eventually a commentators role at the nation 
in 1952 amid the recriminations of the mccarthy years stone 
published the hidden history of the korean war which suggested 
that the war was started not by north korean aggression but as the 
result of a plot by south korea and the united states 
unable to find regular work in the early 1950s stone started his 
weekly from washington with his wifes help 
eighteen years ago failing eyesight and heart trouble forced him 
to abandon the newsletter stone who was nearly blind had in 
recent years taken more interest in ancient greece than in the 
backrooms of the nations capital 
he recently published the trial of socrates a book he spent 
15 years researching the author learned classical greek to piece 
together one of his final scoops a highly critical account of 
the greek philosopher and teacher who was sentenced to death 2500 
years ago 
he obviously had an extraordinary intellect but he had a will 
that was the equal of his talent it was a form of intellectual 
courage more than anything else navasky said 
besides his wife of 59 years esther stone is survived by two 
sons jeremy jay and christopher and a daughter celia stone

most american middle schools are too large and 
impersonal to meet adolescents intellectual and emotional needs 
and the result for many students may be a life on the edge of 
society according to a new report 
middle grade schools could be a strong positive influence on 
adolescents as they face a world in which they are tempted to 
experiment with alcohol sex and drugs according to the report by a 
task force of the carnegie council on adolescent development 
instead many large middle grade schools function as mills that 
contain and process endless streams of students within them are 
masses of anonymous youth said the study such settings 
virtually guarantee that the intellectual and emotional needs of 
youth will go unmet 
the report titled turning points preparing american youth for 
the 21st century was released sunday on the first day of a 
threeday meeting sponsored by the carnegie corp of new york to 
focus on ways to improve midlevel schools 
of the 28 million us children between ages 10 and 17 
onefourth may face futures in serious jeopardy because of the 
consequences of school dropout drug use or early unprotected sex 
the study said citing research conducted for an upcoming book 
adolescents at risk by joy g dryfoos another 7 million 
children may be at moderate risk it said 
students who drop out of school or emerge semiliterate cannot 
compete for jobs requiring literate technically trained workers 
what is left for these young men and women is a life on the 
edge of society the report said 
the study said middle schools should be restructured on a more 
human scale by 
creating smaller environments for learning by dividing large 
schools into schools within schools where children know each 
other and their teachers better 
teaching a core academic program aimed at producing students who 
are literate understand the sciences and have a sense of health 
ethics and citizenship 
eliminating use of tracking students by achievement level 
which the report said essentially dooms many children to failure 
giving teachers and administrators more creative power and 
hiring teachers who specialize in dealing with young adolescents 
involving parents and community leaders in the schools 
boosting students health and fitness with more inschool 
programs and by helping those who need public health care to get it 
the study suggested dividing schools into smaller communities of 
200 to 500 students who represent a crosssection of the school in 
terms of ethnic and socioeconomic background and intellectual 
ability those students would be teamed with a set of teachers who 
would work together to provide a more unified learning environment 
for example separate classes in english arts history and 
social studies could be organized around a single theme such as 
immigration the report said students should be given longterm 
writing assignments and national achievement tests should be 
expanded to judge students on the basis of an overall work 
portfolio it said 
some classes should be longer than the 40 to 50minute norm and 
each student should be well known by at least one adult at 
school who can provide counseling and academic help the report 
recommended 
the result the report said should be a thinking productive 
caring and healthy person who takes seriously the responsibility of 
good citizenship 
our vision is of such an outcome for every youth of the nation 
not just for those more advantaged than others it said 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
praised the report saying it recognizes it is not too late to 
improve the educational opportunities of those students who are 
already in school 
national education association president mary hatwood futrell 
said she agreed with the reports recommendations but the reality 
is that we must lay the groundwork for school success long before 
these tumultuous years 
we must begin earlier than grades six seven or eight she 
said we must prime our youngest students for academic success

korsair a valuable european show dog 
missing for a week had only to hear a few words of french to 
realize he was back among friends 
as soon as i started speaking to him in french he came right 
up to me and buried his head in my side said gerald a rousseau 
a dog trainer who took command of the 3yearold belgian malinois 
after he was captured by police 
the dog valued as high as 50000 slipped from his cage while 
he and his french owner were changing flights at ohare 
international airport on june 12 
korsair was spotted sunday morning in the back yard of a mount 
prospect home a few miles from the airport 
police officer jim lange won korsair over with a few dog biscuits 
and was able to slip a leash over the animals head 
an examination by a vet showed the dog had gashes on his front 
legs and inside an ear but otherwise was alert and in good shape 
said rousseau 
as soon as i saw him i ran him through a series of commands in 
french heel sit bound jump stay he said that and a tattoo 
proved he was korsair 
bob rankin 61 didnt know the dog understood only french when 
he spotted the animal lying in his backyard and it started snarling 
at him 
i dont know a french dog from a polish dog especially when he 
bares his teeth at me rankin a roofer said sunday night 
the breed is a kind of sheepdog resembling a german shepherd 
korsair is highly trained and was being transported across the 
nation by owner daniel paul to be shown at seminars on training dogs 
rousseau said the dog probably gashed his leg by climbing or 
jumping over the barb wiretopped fence that rings the 7000acre 
airport 
while the dog appeared a little thin rousseau said hes sure the 
animal has been finding some food 
im certain he either caught rabbits or other wild game or 
found food going through garbage he said 
rousseau said korsairs owner was elated when he heard the dog 
had been found 
he started crying rousseau said 
paul said the dog is worth 20000 because of his pedigree stud 
value and championship record but louis auslander chairman of the 
american kennel club said it could be worth 50000 
united airlines which was transporting the owner and dog when 
korsair disappeared had offered a reward of several hundred dollars 
for his return 
the police department is not allowed to accept the money so it 
will be donated toward the medical expenses of 9yearold joshua 
mayo of mount prospect who was struck by a car and critically 
injured friday

congress this week delves into issues involving 
americas advanced computing capabilities including sweeping senate 
legislation that would establish a highspeed network to link the 
nations supercomputers 
sen albert gore jr dtenn chief sponsor of the 175 billion 
measure said such a network could be as important to the countrys 
information future as the interstate highway system was in building 
up us transportation over the past three decades 
highcapacity fiber optic networks will be the information 
superhighways of tomorrow he declared 
gore added that the nation which most completely assimilates 
highperformance computing into its economy will very likely emerge 
as the dominant intellectual economic and technological force in 
the next century 
in addition to the supercomputer network the tennessee 
democrats bill also calls for a coordinated national strategy on 
highperformance computer technology as well as increased funding 
for research and development of computer equipment and software 
the gore legislation is to be taken up at a hearing wednesday of 
the senate commerce subcommittee on science technology and space 
sen james m jeffords rvt a cosponsor of the measure said 
the united states is recognized as the world leader in 
supercomputing but this doesnt mean that countries like france 
west germany and japan like it foreign competition is growing 
one way to ensure that our preeminence in supercomputing is 
not wasted is to make the data readily accessible to everyone that 
can benefit from it jeffords said if we bring academia 
industry and government together were going to see results 
another cosponsor sen dave durenberger rminn noted that 
supercomputers were among items singled out in the bush 
administrations recent super 301 action citing japan for unfair 
trading practices 
we make the best supercomputers in the world and there is no 
reason the japanese should refuse to give serious consideration to 
our supercomputers simply because japan wants to develop its own 
supercomputer industry durenberger said 
the status and future of supercomputing in the united states is 
also to be the focus of a hearing tuesday by the house science 
subcommittee on science research and technology 
marc rotenberg washington representative of computer 
professionals for social responsibility a public interest group 
based in palo alto calif called the gore legislation good 
news 
we need to be reconsidering funding priorities in computer 
science rotenberg said sen gores bill would strengthen our 
basic research in research institutions across the country and 
also develop infrastructure to make it possible for systems that are 
already in place to be accessible to more users 
most supercomputer networks currently run 2000 times slower than 
the 3 gigabit per second network which gores measure aims to create 
by 1996 
the bill embodies many of the recommendations set forth in a 
november 1987 report issued by the white house office of science and 
technology policy 
that report concluded that a strong domestic highperformance 
computer industry is essential for maintaining us leadership in 
critical national security areas and in broad sectors of the 
civilian economy

legislation for a national child care program 
is before the senate this week but the bill faces bush 
administration opposition unless provisions for taxpayer subsidies 
are eliminated 
the multibillion dollar proposal would offer parents both 
subsidies and federal tax credits for child care while the 
administration favors a program financed entirely by tax credits 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas says a child care 
program is a high priority with the administration but added 
gop senators will try to substitute the tax credit payment plan 
senators this week also will consider a 45 billion 
authorization for the state department the agency for international 
development the us information agency and other related agencies 
the senate foreign relations committee sent the bill to the floor 
knowing that it authorizes more funds than permitted by a ceiling 
set by congress and the white house 
the committee included an amendment authorizing 194 million to 
build a transmitter in israel for radio liberty which broadcasts to 
the soviet union 
but the panel declined to fund the transmitter by taking the 
money from a fund intended to pay past and present us dues to the 
united nations 
the house meanwhile may resume contentious debate on a 
supplemental spending plan providing more than 3 billion in extra 
funds following the failure of housesenate negotiators to agree on 
whether to provide more money this year for the war on drugs 
the 822 million housepassed provision to increase antidrug 
spending is the largest of several items left unresolved 
chairman robert c byrd dwva of the senate appropriations 
committee contends the extra money isnt needed and the bush 
administration threatens a presidential veto if it is included 
but house democrats insist the money be included as a test of the 
administrations commitment to battling drug abuse 
under the senate child care compromise reached last week 
regulations would be set by the states although federal guidelines 
would be drafted for states to follow if they wished 
the revised plan permits vouchers to be used to pay for child 
care at churchrun centers if the money is not used in a manner 
inconsistent with the constitution which mandates a separation 
between church and state 
a taxcredit package added by the senate finance committee also 
was added to the bill 
it would make the existing dependentcare tax credit refundable 
in advance also a new credit would give back up to 500 to help 
families with annual incomes of less than 21000 pay for their 
childrens health insurance

american manufacturers of products ranging from 
lawn mowers to wine coolers are being hit by extra costs due to 
efforts in western europe to create a single market among 12 
countries the us commerce department reported 
the department is distributing an analysis of 66 directives 
proposed or adopted in the european economic community as part of 
the plan to break down barriers to internal trade by 1992 nearly 
300 directives are included in the program 
the commerce department believes that the completion of the 
internal market should benefit us companies doing business in 
europe it said however there is a danger if the 1992 program 
is implemented in less than open fashion 
us trade representative carla a hills already has complained 
about a proposal to guarantee a proportion of television time for 
programs produced in europe that would limit the number of american 
programs that could be used us officials call this a local 
content requirement to which free traders object on principle 
jacques delors the head of the communitys joint executive was 
in washington last week explaining to president bush and others the 
french view that this is a cultural matter not a trade matter 
community officials and their american critics are giving major 
attention to the setting of european standards for industrial 
products products that meet these standards will be freely saleable 
in the 12 countries those that do not meet them will not 
us companies want to take part in setting the standards the 
europeans say that only american companies with subsidiaries in 
europe can do that more talks are scheduled between us and 
european officials on this point but some directives have already 
been adopted 
take lawn mowers a directive that goes into effect july 1 1991 
limits the noise that can be made by motorized cylinder lawn mowers 
a rule in effect since 1987 has made us manufacturers of rotary 
lawn mowers either lower the speed of their equipment or redesign 
the engines sales have not been hit us exports of rotary lawn 
mowers to the 12 countries went up 221 percent between 1986 and 1988 
but the commerce department said lower speeds could hurt the 
performance of american mowers and redesigning engines could bring 
increased costs 
or take wine coolers on jan 1 the 12 countries banned the use 
of the 115 ounce bottle current in the united states the report 
said the community wants a bottle containing 14 ounces 
the bottle would be either too fat or too tall for existing 
us production lines the report complained the us 
bottler would incur the added cost of changing production lines and 
maintaining an inventory of another size bottle 
the report said the european directives also have or would affect 
telecommunications auto production and forklift manufacturers

congressional investigators report that 
unchallenged secrecy at nuclear weapons plants allowed the energy 
department and its private contractors to neglect a need for 
improved health and safety programs 
the safety problems which came to light mostly over the past two 
years were aggravated by a lack of outside scrutiny and effective 
oversight from the energy department which pays private companies 
to run the facilities the congressional report issued sunday said 
this penchant for secrecy and the classified nature of the 
process of making nuclear weapons contributed to a mindset of 
emphasizing production at the expense of health and safety the 
report said 
a variety of congressional committees and independent panels have 
been studying problems in the weapons complex which includes 16 
major facilities in 12 states some of key facilities are closed 
down for repairs and improvements 
the latest blow to the weapons program was struck at the rocky 
flats plutonium fabrication plant near boulder colo where fbi 
agents swooped in june 6 to check out allegations of a coverup of 
illegal storage and waste disposal practices 
the energy department subsequently froze nearly 5 million in 
bonus payments to the operator of the rocky flats facility rockwell 
international corp 
the bonuses were to cover work performed between september 1988 
and march 1989 but have been frozen indefinitely according to 
w henson moore energy department deputy director 
theyre not going to get that money until we know more moore 
said friday 
energy secretary james d watkins is putting together a 
masterplan for modernizing the complex and cleaning up the 
radioactive and toxic wastes that have contaminated the sites and 
surrounding areas during 40 years of bomb making he says national 
security may be jeopardized if improvements arent made quickly 
estimates of the rebuilding and cleanup cost range up to 150 
billion over 30 years 
obsessive secrecy and lack of outside oversight have been 
hallmarks of the nuclear weapons program since its beginning as the 
wartime manhattan engineering district in the early 1940s rep 
john d dingell dmich said in a letter accompanying the 
investigators report 
the inquiry was conducted over three years by the house energy 
and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations dingell 
is chairman of the subcommittee as well as the full energy and 
commerce committee 
the investigators listed a variety of incidents and shortcomings 
in the weapons complex that have been documented by other agencies 
in recent years 
they include 
the use of illegal drugs at some of the most sensitive weapons 
facilities including the los alamos national laboratory in new 
mexico which designs and tests nuclear arms the hanford nuclear 
reservation near richland wash which is involved in a variety of 
nuclear materials production and the oak ridge y12 plant in 
tennessee which makes weapons components and uranium 
inadequate fire protection at the savannah river site near 
aiken sc which is the nations only source of tritium a 
radioactive gas used to make warheads the report cited a 1986 
federal review of the problem that said the only firefighting 
device available at one nuclear reactor there was an ordinary garden 
hose 
poor training of safety inspectors at hanford and savannah 
river it took the energy department five years to discover that 
several inspectors at hanford had not been properly certified for 
their jobs because of improperly graded tests or a lack of

chinas disdainful response to world criticism 
over its bloody crackdown on student protesters is in keeping with a 
2000year tradition of insularity and a sense of righteousness 
china long assumed a vast gulf between itself called the 
central country in chinese and other countries which were 
considered uncivilized economic selfsufficiency enabled it to 
maintain this view as the limits of communication preserved 
ignorance about the rest of the world 
but china no longer is selfsufficient and foreign opinion cannot 
be blocked out 
foreign investment and technology are key to its economic 
development plans and china has come to rely on some imports even 
while denouncing the united states for sheltering a leading 
dissident in its beijing embassy china imported extra tons of us 
wheat to make up for its own poor harvest 
since senior leader deng xiaoping began economic reforms a decade 
ago nearly 10000 foreign companies have set up joint ventures in 
china with a total investment of 12 billion many manufacture goods 
for export generating hard currency china needs for its 
modernization 
chinese leaders have said repeatedly since the army attacked 
unarmed protesters in bejing on june 34 killing hundreds that 
they want and expect foreign countries to continue trade and 
investment but they also have reiterated they will not accept 
foreign criticism of the bloody crackdown 
we hope that all countries that wish to keep and develop 
friendly relations with china will take a longterm view and avoid 
doing anything to hurt the feelings of the chinese people premier 
li peng told top party officials in a recent speech 
government spokesman yuan mu was blunter telling a news 
conference we are not spineless people we are not afraid 
of condemnation or sanction 
it has gotten both the united states cut off military sales and 
contacts france and the netherlands froze relations japan chinas 
largest singlecountry source of aid put off new development 
assistance loans canada and france temporarily withdrew their 
ambassadors 
several countries canceled planned highlevel official exchanges 
it is not the first time foreign governments have criticized 
dengs policies the us congress has passed repeated resolutions 
criticizing china for opening fire on proindependence protesters in 
tibet over the past two years 
however it is the first time condemnation of china has been so 
nearly universal even hungarys communist government expressed 
outrage and the soviet parliament urged wisdom reason and a 
weighted approach 
it also is the first time that criticism has been backed by 
action 
a speech deng gave in 1987 indicates he may not have expected 
that he said that after the last largescale arrests of 
prodemocracy activists in 1979 china suffered no discredit 
on the contrary the prestige of the country is steadily 
growing he said 
china also has emerged unscathed from controversies over its 
foreign policy such as its arms sales to iran and support in 
cambodia of the khmer rouge whose forces killed hundreds of 
thousands of countrymen while in power from 197578 
the decision of the top government spokesman yuan mu to give a 
rare interview to the us television network nbc last week may have 
been an effort to counter the avalanche of foreign condemnation 
in it he reiterated the governments position that the army 
fired on the crowds june 34 only after provocation he condemned 
foreign news reports as distortions and suggested that even foreign 
film of the killing was fabricated 
china could have avoided much of the bad press abroad if it had 
expelled all foreign reporters ahead of time but thousands of 
foreign businessmen and diplomats who also could bear witness would 
have had to be expelled as well 
whats more such a move would have been an admission that china 
had something to hide chinese officials apparently believe that if 
they reiterate the official explanation often enough and wait long 
enough foreign businessmen and diplomats will trickle back 
they may be right a survey of 116 american business executives 
before the crackdown found 55 percent believed china would become a 
more attractive market after the shooting 67 executives were asked 
again fiftythree percent still agreed

a hot item at beacon restaurant 
is a tshirt bearing the slogan lake tahoe a sunny place for 
shady people 
such humor is common in this wooded tourist haven following 
charges of money laundering and conspiracy against mayor terry 
trupp 46 and his fourth wife kimberly 24 
hangouts like ernies coffee shop and the south lake tahoe 
country club have been rife with gossip and jokes about the arrests 
not many are surprised for years people have wondered how trupp 
afforded a maserati and an airplane 
he was not as much a part of the community as many of us are 
he didnt belong to the rotary club said john wynn president of 
the chamber of commerce 
he drove fast cars rode motorcycles and was rather grandiose 
in talking about his international business dealings 
when pressed about his income trupp often said he dealt in 
foreign currency 
but in an affidavit accompanying his request for a public 
defender trupp listed his only source of income as the 300 a month 
and medical expenses he receives from the city 
nestled in the snowcapped sierra nevada of eastern california 
this town of 30000 residents hardly shows the seamy underside 
brought to light by a recent sting operation code named deep 
snow 
trupp told undercover internal revenue service agents he had a 
method to launder money out of the country that left no paper 
trail and no tax liability and that the system had been in place for 
20 years according to one affidavit 
the 20month investigation resulted in the arrest of the trupps 
and 17 others including a chiropractor also arrested was robert 
moon accused of being a drug courier who was picked up by agents as 
he prepared to tee off in a golf tournament 
the ring was accused of laundering 750000 the mayor laundered 
108000 authorities said 
many say trupps alleged involvement is symptomatic of the citys 
darker ties to nevada gaming trupp was a regular at lillys 
nightclub wearing gold chains slickedback hair and pompadour 
people say he called himself a rock n roller 
the casinos control some of these city council members not 
directly but they do it through campaign contributions said tom 
martens of the environmental group the league to save south lake 
tahoe 
we get all the social problems from the casinos we get the 
drug problems the alcohol problems and the gambling problems all 
caused by the casinos and they dont contribute money into 
california to solve these problems 
city officials have sought to distance themselves from trupp 
they called him a skilled politician but no one interviewed said 
they knew him well 
i didnt know him outside of the city council we didnt move 
in the same circles said acting mayor neva roberts who begins a 
regular term as mayor in july when trupps term would have ended 
i didnt know any of his friends 
roberts and councilman norm woods said the scandal will leave no 
scars 
of course we were all shocked said woods who has known 
trupp 11 years but this is an isolated case not a reflection on 
the city as a whole well get over it 
but martens who often disagreed with the progrowth trupp over 
environmental issues said the case has undercovered ills in 
government 
i havent heard anyone say theres something wrong with a 
government system that allows a guy like this to get elected for 11 
years or theres something wrong with a government that allows him 
to put no income on his campaign and political reporting forms he 
said 
the rumor mills meantime are keeping the issue alive 
since it happened its all we talk about said charlene 
wightman a bartender this is better that watching all my 
children

in the mountains of montana where elk 
hunting puts meat on the table gun enthusiasts acknowledge 
president bushs proposal to limit the firepower of semiautomatic 
weapons wont affect their sport directly 
still many oppose the new legislation because as one said its 
a footinthedoor kind of thing 
bush a lifetime member of the national rifle association 
entered the white house saying he didnt believe in restrictions on 
semiautomatic weapons 
but in march following outrage over the slaying of five 
schoolchildren in stockton calif by a man with an ak47 rifle 
bush banned imports of assaultstyle firearms last month he called 
for a 15shot limit on magazine size 
montana hunters take their weapons seriously befitting a state 
where big game is big business nonresident elk licenses sell for a 
crisp 450 and hunters from throughout the world stalk mountain goat 
and bighorn sheep 
sportsmen in montana primarily use highpowered boltaction 
rifles where accuracy over long distances is more important than the 
number of shots fired 
the idea of spraying a whitetail deer an elk or a moose with 30 
fast shots from an assault rifle is mindboggling to the average 
montana hunter who hopes to have meat left to eat 
they also said the big banana clips of ammunition are heavy 
and cumbersome reducing a rifles accuracy 
you dont go big game hunting with 15round clips most have 
four or five rounds in their rifle and a spare clip in their 
pocket said kalispell gun dealer bj lupton the sportsman is 
concerned about doing things as cleanly as possible and in a 
sportsmanlike way so he doesnt go hunting with a 15round clip 
anyway 
the big clips defeat the purpose of a sporting firearm to kill 
cleanly with one shot said al bishop a billings attorney and 
former member of the montana fish and game commission 
but in a state where many believe the right to bear arms was the 
11th commandment the presidents proposal still meets opposition 
i think weve got our issues tangled a little bit lupton 
said the sportsmen in montana are not concerned about 15round 
clips for hunting but i think they may be concerned with an 
invasion of their constitutional right to bear arms 
paul berg a retired wildlife biologist of billings wonders what 
good bushs proposal will do its just a footinthedoor kind of 
thing to take all our guns away from us in time he said 
david scott president of the billings rod and gun club also 
argued that the 15round limit is merely a starting point for people 
who would outlaw guns completely 
it may solve some problems to limit the clips to 15 but still 
youre starting to infringe on what you can own and what you cant 
own scott added 
its a law without a purpose and a law that cannot be 
enforced said rocky hook of missoula its only effect would be 
against lawabiding people if it were passed i guarantee you youd 
still see drug dealers with banana clips coming out of their uzis 
two bigclip rifles the ruger mini14 and the colt ar16 the 
civilian version of the armys m16 are popular with some varmint 
hunters precisely because they carry big clips 
having up to 30 shots is handy for shooting fastmoving coyotes 
gophers and squirrels hook said 
dick pedersen of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms has 
said his bureau is concerned about guns with pistol grips which 
are used predominantly for firing from the hip bayonet lugs that 
allow a bayonet to be fixed collapsible shoulder stocks for 
closein combattype shooting and concealability threaded barrels 
which could accept silencers and largecapacity magazines 
the bush administration is waiting for the bureau to complete a 
study to determine whether the weapons are used for sports as 
required for imports 
but the nra contends americans shouldnt have to prove their guns 
are used for sports because the second amendment guarantees the 
right to bear arms 
officials such as baltimore county md police chief neil behan 
see it differently however because of increasing crime rate 
involving assault weapons 
if we have to sacrifice someones minor recreation endeavor in 
order to save lives i think thats a sacrifice we can make in 
this country behan said

on friday the dollar fell 625 yen 
goshin mizuno a dealer with nomura securities said that 
although the nikkei index fell monday there was a considerable 
volume of transactions 
the most important factor is that financial authorities 
including the bank of japan have coordinated their intervention 
activities he said 
as a result speculation has decreased and sharp fluctuations 
have become fewer mizuno said he added that transactions centered 
around capital investment issues such as yamatakehoneywell 
he also said there would not be many announcements of important 
economic indexes this week such announcements often affect the 
direction of trading

without much effect dealers said

space shuttle astronaut s david griggs was 
performing aerial stunts before his world war ii vintage plane 
crashed in a wheat field killing him witnesses said 
investigators waded into the kneehigh stalks of wheat as they 
tried to determine what caused saturday mornings crash 
griggs 49 who was scheduled to pilot a november shuttle 
mission was practicing with the propellerdriven north american t6 
trainer for a weekend air show witnesses and investigators said 
he was cutting up flying upside down and all kinds of ways 
every kind of way ive ever seen them fly those things said 
william h wooden who was working in his yard when the plane 
crashed 
wooden said he heard the engine stop 
it looked like he was clowning around said otis barker who 
was working in his garden about 150 yards from the crash site about 
20 miles west of memphis tenn hed go up then shut off the 
motor and fire it up again 
sandra pearson a federal aviation administration supervisor 
said sunday the cause of the crash was not yet apparent 
the faa the national transportation safety board and national 
aeronautics and space administration had investigators at the site 
according to the faas peter kerwin 
robert hudson organizer of the air show at clarksville said the 
astronauts death left him and other pilots shaken hudson said he 
was told that griggs who logged 9500 hours of flying could 
really fly the airplane real well and that everybody would be 
pleased it was exciting 
of course he didnt make it it was a real shock to us 
hudson said 
it kind of put a lump in my throat if not my stomach but we 
still had the show to do we couldnt call it off we went ahead and 
we had a good show but there was that fear i was feeling and you 
know theres a certain amount of risk anyway hudson said 
the stunt plane was registered to greg mcneely a friend of 
griggs who was to have participated in the show the faa said 
the mcneelys were not available for comment sunday a woman who 
answered the phone at mcneely charter service said she had been told 
to refer questions to nasa 
a nasa spokesman jeff carr said the agency did not restrict 
what the astronauts did in their spare time 
you cant lock these guys in their houses these guys have 
thousands of hours of flying experience they take a greater risk 
driving down the gulf freeway in houston than by flying there are 
no restrictions on piloting carr said from houston 
the crash would not affect novembers launch and a replacement 
would be named within two weeks carr said 
flying was a hobby for griggs who served as a mission specialist 
on the shuttle discovery in april 1985 according to a nasa 
biography he had been an astronaut since august 1979 the space 
agency said 
griggs a native of portland ore was appointed chief of the 
shuttle training aircraft operations office in january 1976 with 
responsibilities that included operational use of the shuttle 
trainer he served in the navy including two combat tours in 
southeast asia and a stint as a navy test pilot 
griggs who lived in the houston area is survived by his wife 
karen and daughters alison marie 17 and carre anne 15

house speaker thomas foley says its time for 
president bush to begin speaking out more forcefully in opposition 
to the harsh chinese crackdown on prodemocracy dissidents 
as chinas hardline leadership hands out death sentences to 
dissident leaders and western journalists continue to be expelled 
foley and others on capitol hill are expressing skepticism that the 
united states can afford a businessasusual approach 
foley dwash noted sunday that there are those who believe 
bush ought to be speaking more loudly and more clearly as 
chinas leadership takes steps to erase the prodemocracy movement 
the president ought to be doing that said foley interviewed 
on nbcs meet the press 
the speaker also said the united states should break relations 
immediately with china if the chinese use violence against the us 
embassy in beijing to seize dissident fang lizhi who sought refuge 
there two weeks ago 
the us decision to harbor fang and his wife li shuxian has 
angered the chinese leadership which has accused the united states 
of interfering in chinas internal affairs 
while the administration has repeatedly said it abhors the 
violent and bloody means used by the chinese to crush the 
studentled democracy movement the president has been reluctant to 
direct harsh rhetoric at beijing or affix blame for the june 4 
massacre of the protesters around tiananmen square according to 
western intelligence estimates some 3000 persons were probably 
killed 
bush moved swiftly to curtail military sales to china but did 
not recall the ambassador nor did he draw down the official 
diplomatic presence there 
he and other administratio officials have said repeatedly that 
they oppose taking economic sanctions saying such steps might hurt 
the chinese people 
but others on capitol hill think differently even some from the 
presidents own party 
sen pete wilson rcalif called the idea of business as usual 
with chinas regime an intolerable idea 
wilson appearing saturday on cnn said he intends to introduce a 
resolution in the senate calling for the revocation of that 
countrys favored trading status with the united states 
the united states must be a moral leader i think weve got 
to do that with some concrete tangible means wilson said 
under the mostfavored designation a trading partner must be 
given the best trade terms granted to any other nation 
although a congressional resolution would be nonbinding wilson 
said it is important to put the congress on record against the 
chinese regimes bloody suppression of the prodemocracy movement 
the united states is the largest direct investor in the 
peoples republic of china the hope is that a more moderate 
leadership takes over but one can assist that to come about 
wilson argued 
the senator said the us government used trade pressures against 
the soviet union to bring about human rights reforms and should do 
so with china 
a house banking finance and urban affairs subcommittee has 
scheduled hearings tuesday on human rights in china 
richard schifter the assistant secretary of state for human 
rights and humanitarian affairs is expected to be grilled about 
chinas crackdown while treasury officials will be questioned about 
pending multilateral development bank loans to beijing

when pacific southwest airlines flight 1771 
took off from los angeles its passengers included a nononsense 
supervisor and a hottempered former underling who sneaked a gun 
aboard 
over central california the bad feelings between david burke and 
his former usair boss ray thomson ended in an airborne shooting 
that moved from the passenger compartment to the cockpit 
with its slain crew slumped over the controls midway to their san 
francisco destination dec 7 1987 the fourengine bae146 smashed 
into a hillside north of san luis obispo all 43 aboard were killed 
eighteen months later attorneys are dissecting the final minutes 
of the life of burke 35 the usair employee was fired three weeks 
earlier by thomson 48 who had denied burke reinstatement during a 
meeting shortly before they boarded the flight 
the negligence lawsuit is midway through trial in superior court 
it was filed by the relatives of eight passengers and two crew 
members against the los angeles department of airports ogden allied 
security co psa and usair which bought psa 
jurors will have to fix percentages of responsibility if any 
for the defendants as well as any damages which attorneys agree 
could run into millions of dollars no set dollar amount was 
requested 
at issue is whether the defendants could have reasonably guessed 
burkes actions and stopped him the defendants have said that was 
impossible and have countersued the estate of burke as the man 
solely responsible for the crash 
the plaintiffs say burke should never have been allowed past the 
security checkpoint at los angeles international airport 
norman bottom a security expert for the plaintiffs said usair 
should have notified security personnel and airport police about 
burkes dismissal three weeks before distributed a photo of him and 
change locks to which he had keys 
defendants say nothing came to their attention to warrant such 
action 
defense attorneys also have tried to point out that burkes 
considerable temper was largely limited to arguments with his 
girlfriend away from the job 
bottom said he has concluded that burke managed to sneak the gun 
past the security checkpoint by concealing it under clothing and 
using his identification badge to avoid metal detectors 
defense attorneys have alluded to an fbi report not yet admitted 
into evidence that suggests burke used the airports back stairways 
and halls to reach the public storage lockers in the secure area of 
the terminal 
the fbi report said the use of employeeonly hallways and stairs 
combined with wearing a usair employee badge to avoid suspicion 
would have been the least obtrusive way to bypass security 
testimony has established that burke a ticket agent fired nov 
15 for allegedly stealing petty cash handed in two usair employee 
identification badges but kept a third 
burkes whereabouts between 130 pm and 2 pm havent been 
established at 2 pm he showed up at thomsons office outside 
the security area for an appointment to appeal his dismissal he 
met with thomson for 25 minutes seeking reinstatement after 
waiting to see him for nearly 20 minutes 
thomsons secretary ruth wagner testified that burke seemed 
happy after the meeting i said have a nice day and he said i 
will she recalled 
but she said thomson emerged from the meeting redfaced and 
stressed heading for his flight home to san francisco 
conflicting with that time frame was testimony from mutual of 
omaha agent marissa chavez who said she sold burke two insurance 
policies for 100000 and 195000 at about 230 pm 
chavez also said she recalled smelling alcohol on burkes breath 
burke originally bought his ticket for an earlier flight to san 
francisco but changed it to the 330 pm flight after meeting with 
thomson that assured he would be on the flight with thomson who 
often commuted between los angeles and his san francisco area home 
although the trial could result in sizable settlements for the 
plaintiffs its outcome would have little effect on the nations 
airport security which already has been increased because of the 
crash 
the federal aviation administration issued directives tightening 
requirements for airline employees and management of id badge 
distribution

authorities today postponed indefinitely a special 
session of the national legislature that was scheduled before the 
prodemocracy movement was crushed with the intent of discussing the 
movements demands 
the move further deepens the mystery about what is going on 
inside communist chinas traditionally secretive leadership 
the legislature may be waiting until the communist party holds an 
expected central committee meeting to formally oust party general 
secretary zhao ziyang who has reportedly already been stripped of 
power qiao shi the party official responsible for security has 
emerged as a likely successor 
wan li the chairman of the national peoples congress had 
scheduled a special session beginning tuesday 
but a man who answered the telephone at the congresss press 
office said the session was postponed because beijing has not yet 
returned completely to normal no new date was set 
several thousand student protesters had planned to stay in 
central beijings tiananmen square outside the great hall of the 
people where the congress meets until the session began 
but they were routed out june 34 when troops with tanks and 
machine guns shot their way through huge crowds protecting the 
students and rolled into the square hundreds of unarmed civilians 
were killed 
the nearly 3000legislature normally meets just once a year 
with a 135member standing committee fulfilling its duties the rest 
of the year 
it was not clear what wan had in mind by calling the session 
though discussion had been expected on how to deal with the 
prodemocracy movements demands for reforms including a free press 
and an end to official corruption the congress has played a 
somewhat larger role in shaping legislation in recent years but 
still has no say in basic policy 
the 17member politburo and party elders including senior leader 
deng xiaoping hold the real reins of power 
although wan has a reputation as a political moderate like other 
moderates he has publicly supported the army crackdown and visited 
the troops to thank them for crushing what is now being called a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the only top officials absent from the public eye in recent days 
and believed purged are zhao and party propaganda chief hu qili who 
chinese sources said opposed the crackdown 
qiao a politburo member told a meeting of nonparty officials 
saturday that it is very natural that people have different views 
and doubts under the current complicated situation 
the comments reported sunday by the official peoples daily 
newspaper were more conciliatory than past remarks by hardliners 
who now control the communist party 
two weeks after the sweep on tiananmen square the military 
presence on central city streets was sharply reduced more than 100 
army trucks most filled with soldiers drove east from the city 
center before dawn apparently heading for bases in the suburbs 
most of the estimated 150000 soldiers called into beijing to 
enforce martial law have returned to bases outside the city western 
diplomats said 
the number of soldiers guarding tiananmen square was cut sharply 
this morning and armored personnel carriers that had been parked 
there were gone pedestrians remain barred from the square 
soldiers stood guard at only key intersections the television

dental records will be required to identify 
eight people killed in a fiery collision officials said was the 
worst accident ever on the desolate highway through the everglades 
known as alligator alley 
the driver of a toyota pickup truck was trying to pass on the 
narrow twolane road about 44 miles west of naples sunday when he 
ran headon into a pontiac firebird with seven people the florida 
highway patrol said 
the crash engulfed both vehicles in flames and killed everyone 
inside within seconds said lt malcolm rhodes in fort myers 
ive been here for eight years and ive never seen anything 
this bad rhodes said 
the blaze gutted the vehicles and melted the license plates 
forcing investigators to sift through a grisly scene of charred 
debris for clues to the victims identities 
the burning cars also sparked a brush fire that blackened 
hundreds of acres south of the accident 
collier county medical examiner william r anderson said the best 
hope for identifying the victims was by matching teeth and bones 
with dental and medical records 
the 100mile eastwest highway through the everglades linking 
fort lauderdale and naples was closed following the 440 pm 
accident and did not reopen until 830 pm said florida highway 
patrol duty officer doug dailey 
until sunday the worst accidents on the alley had claimed four 
lives the latest fourperson fatality was a headon collision about 
two miles down the road from sundays crash nov 2 1987 
it appears the westbound pickup driver was just passing and 
did not judge the closing distance rhodes said i dont see 
signs of excessive speeds 
the florida highway patrol initially reported that nine people 
were killed in the burning wreckage because officers on the scene 
mistakenly identified a 20 to 25pound fish as a victim 
tracy roberts 20 and amy burgess 22 both of boca raton 
sideswiped the wreckage in their car but escaped injury 
i saw them hit and things fly and the back of the white car 
went up ms burgess said i yelled at tracy and he swerved 
she said there was chaos following the accident 
people were yelling move the car its going to explode and 
i just tried not to look said ms burgess adding that the memory 
of the crash will remain with her forever

the crashlanding of an afghan airliner in 
eastern iran in which six people were killed was caused by a fight 
between the crew and security guards irans official islamic 
republic news agency reported today 
the agency and tehran radio both monitored in nicosia made no 
mention of a hijacking which earlier iranian and afghan reports had 
blamed for sundays crash in the desert southeast of zabol close to 
the afghan border 
irna said deputy prime minister alireza moayyeri sent by premier 
hussein musavi to zabol sunday to investigate the incident had 
found that the fight aboard the twinengined antonov an26 led to 
the crash 
he did not elaborate but said that investigators had determined 
the full details irna reported in a dispatch from zabol 700 
miles southeast of tehran 
the radio quoted the governor of zabol district as saying that 
according to accounts given by passengers the plane had headed 
for iranian territory as a result of the clash on board it did 
not elaborate 
the ariana afghan airways plane was flying from kabul the aghan 
capital to the provincial city of zaranj in the southwest across 
the border from zabol with 38 passengers and crew aboard when it 
ran into trouble 
moayyeri said four people earlier reported to be a woman and 
three men died in the crashlanding 
two of the 34 injured dragged from the wreckage died later in 
zabols imam khomeini hospital he said one was identified as a 
70yearold man 
irna listed the pilot mir weis haji 50 and the copilot khayr 
mohammad sadar khayl 26 among the injured the agency on sunday 
named the pilot as mirvis paktia 
irna said a team from irans civil aviation organization 
submitted a report on the incident to moayyeri this morning 
the report said neither the control tower at zabol airport or the 
tower at the iranian city of zahedan 100 miles to the south 
monitored any distress calls from the afghan pilot 
but the report said both airports prepared for an emergency 
landing when the antonov entered iranian airspace it was not known 
why the pilot did not try to make for either iranian airport 
in kabul foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said 
earlier today that the antonov had been hijacked and that 12 people 
aboard the airliner were being held hostage 
he did not say where his information came from but said the 
hijackers identities were not known 
he also charged that afghan diplomats have not been allowed to 
go near the site of the hijacking 
but irna said an afghan delegation left for zabol today to 
investigate the incident and to arrange for transporting the 
casualties and dead back to afghanistan 
afghanistan and iran do not have diplomatic relations but 
maintain embassies in each others capitals 
iran supports moslem guerrillas in afghanistan who have been 
fighting the sovietbacked kabul government for 10 years

tear gas fumes and the sounds of rifle fire 
and explosions from israeli efforts to quell the palestinian 
uprising in the gaza strip are common in camp canada 
the camp is home to about 5000 palestinians forgotten in the 
middle east conflict and barred from their gaza homeland by the 1979 
israeliegypt peace pact camp canada is in egyptian rafah 135 
feet away across two chainlink border fences and rolls of barbed 
wire 
under the peace treaty the frontier between egypt and the 
israelioccupied gaza strip drawn in 1982 bisected rafah stranding 
about 560 palestinian families in egypts only refugee camp 
the dividing line also divided many families but they were told 
they would be reunited in gaza within a month 
for years the main contact has been across the shouting 
fence where relatives exchange family news 
the main topic is the palestinian uprising in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip that began in december 1987 more than 500 
palestinians and at least 22 israelis have been killed in the 
violence in a clash friday in occupied rafah three arab men were 
killed by israeli army gunfire 
neither israeli nor egyptian officials will talk about the 
sevenyear embarrassment of camp canada named for a canadian 
peacekeeping unit once quartered there alon liel spokesman for the 
israeli foreign ministry said recently the issue is under various 
discussions 
but residents say an 11week process is scheduled to begin this 
week that if completed will return to gaza 67 people in 20 camp 
canada families 
they say tentative plans called for the first two families to 
cross into nomans land next monday meet with relatives and then 
move into occupied gaza they would be followed by two families on 
successive mondays until the program is completed 
under a 1986 agreement egypt is to give each family 8000 for 
resettlement residents said and sources in cairo confirmed that 
israel backed out of its commitment to give each returning family 
land and housing materials valued at 9000 
evidence of the frustration of camp canadas residents is that 
the 20 families agreed to israels conditions they will live with 
relatives 
much of the resentment is toward the united states which camp 
residents perceive as siding with israel 
the key to our problem is america said one camp official 
the americans are the only ones who can solve it why dont 
they do something to make it happen 
weve been through this 20 million times before said a 
teacher at the camp canada school weve been told we were going 
then no i will believe were going when were there 
as palestinians camp residents are foreigners and barred from 
government jobs in egypts governmentdominated economy many have 
not worked for seven years others are underemployed or work on day 
jobs outside the camp 
carpenter gamil mohammed who runs a kiosk decorated with a 
palestinian flag spoke of smelling the tear gas used against fellow 
palestinians across the barbed wire in gaza and of hearing the 
boom of houses being dynamited 
israeli forces frequently destroy homes of palestinians suspected 
of being involved in terrorism 
mohammed introduced his three small sons wearing tshirts with 
slogans supporting the palestine liberation organization and 
uprising the shirts are becoming part of the uniform of camp 
canadas young people 
mohammed said of his son they hope to go to another place 
home

the government is locked in a dogfight with 
the chino planes of fame museum over two soviet fighter jets on 
display 
the state department customs service and bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms insist the museum imported the migs from poland 
illegally 
officials also say the museums 1947 antonov a sovietdesigned 
biplane still in flying condition must go because it was bought in 
hungary 
us law bars importation of military equipment from a list of 
countries that includes poland and hungary based our belief we 
should not contribute to their armament industries by purchasing 
implements of war said jack killorin an atf official in 
washington 
museum officials said they had no idea their purchases were 
illegal 
they sat on the docks down there for two weeks and customs 
passed them right through said karen hinton museum vice 
president 
we made a mistake said customs spokeswoman maryanne noonan 
those planes never should have reached the museum but over a 
million containers a year come in through the seaport we physically 
inspect only a small percentage 
the 31yearold museum which showcases 90 vintage aircraft 
figured it scored a coup last summer when it purchased the migs 
through a broker the mig15 and mig17 similar to those flown 
against us forces in korea were restored by volunteers and 
quickly became a popular attraction 
we had japanese british german and american aircraft in our 
collection ms hinton said and to add something from the 
russian theater really rounded things out 
a june 8 deadline for surrender of the aircraft has long passed 
customs officials said they could have seized the planes and added 
they wont wait much longer 
determined to keep the planes the museum has launched a save the 
migs petition drive gathering nearly 7000 signatures us reps 
jerry lewis and robert k dornan both republicans have pledged 
their support 
were at our wits end ms hinton said we just wanted to 
preserve and display these aircraft so a grandfather can bring in 
his grandson and say look this is what i flew in korea and 
heres what the enemy used 
its just terrible to think they may cut these planes up

two of the citys biggest paging companies are 
cracking down on drug dealers by raising rates for suspiciously 
frequent use of beepers 
the drug problem in the us is far beyond the realm of pagers 
theyre just tools if this helps us do our little part in battling 
drugs then weve done something said ron kilcoyne a spokesman 
for nynex 
police have found that many drug dealers use beepers to keep in 
touch with customers and delivery boys 
nynex on aug 1 plans to start charging 50 cents extra for every 
beep over 500 a month 1 for every beep over 1000 and 250 for 
each month a customer gets more than 1000 beeps 
metromedia paging already has begun charging 1 extra for every 
beep over 1000 
kilcoyne said the average pager user gets between one and two 
calls a day 
if youre getting 1000 pages a month youre not getting much 
work done thats an amazing number of calls it adds up to a page 
every 10 minutes he said 
kilcoyne said that industrywide about 1 percent of beeper users 
get more than 500 beeps a month 
metromedia will donate its money from extra charges to target a 
national organization that helps children deal with alcohol and drug 
problems

the widow of prime minister olof palme 
stood in court today 30 feet from the defendant in her husbands 
murder trial and identified him as the killer 
lisbeth palme who was leaving a movie with her husband when he 
was shot to death the night of feb 28 1986 said she clearly saw 
the defendants face just after the shooting on a stockholm street 
upon crossexamination however she said she had not seen the 
mans hands and thus could not say whether he had a gun 
mrs palmes testimony was crucial to the case against christer 
pettersson a 42yearold swede with a long criminal record he was 
arrested in december 
pettersson wearing a blueandwhite sport coat was brought into 
the heavilyguarded courtroom at the end of mrs palmes testimony 
prosecutor anders helin asked her if she could point out the man 
she saw seconds after the shooting without hesitation she pointed 
at pettersson who was sitting across the room 
im certain she told helin 
if olof palme in his heaven could have heard this he wouldnt 
have liked it said pettersson interrupting over the objections 
of judge carlanton spak if you believe in what youre saying 
its ok but otherwise its not said pettersson in a calm clear 
voice 
guards took him from the room and mrs palme made no reply 
you havent got a camera in your head said defense attorney 
arne liljeros how can you be certain isnt it wishful thinking 
on your part to close the matter 
it will never be closed for me mrs palme said 
saying she still suffered from a deep wound she had refused 
earlier today to testify with pettersson present in the stockholm 
district courtroom 
however the court ruled after she began testifying with 
pettersson outside the courtroom that he should be brought in for an 
identification 
before he entered mrs palme had referred to the defendant only 
as no 8 a reference to petterssons place in a videotaped 
police lineup where mrs palme had earlier picked him out 
i have been trained in my job to observe things not to 
analyze but to observe she told the court mrs palme is a 
psychologist by training 
my state of shock made me even more observant she said 
thats why i remember his face so clearly 
mrs palme who wore a gray suit and a green silk scarf appeared 
on edge during much of her testimony accompanied by her son 
joachim she entered the courtroom walking sideways to avoid facing 
the 60 reporters present 
when court officials tried to show her a map of the scene where 
the killing took place she refused to turn in profile to the 
audience to look at it the map was moved so she could keep her back 
to the gallery 
mrs palme had requested that no official tape recording be made 
of the session that it not be broadcast and that reporters be 
excluded the court agreed to the first two conditions but allowed 
the press inside 
mrs palme was slightly injured in the attack which occurred at 
night on a main stockholm street the gunman escaped down a dark 
alley 
pettersson a 42yearold swede with a history of drug and 
alcohol abuse and a previous conviction for manslaughter has denied 
killing palme 
he had demanded a courtroom identification by mrs palme 
you must realize the responsibility liljeros told her my 
client says he hasnt committed this crime and if youre the least 
bit uncertain about the identity then your responsiblityy is to say 
so 
i am absolutely certain mrs palme replied 
since palmes death mrs palme has shied away from any public 
discussion of the killing she lashed out at the news media on the 
stand today saying they had tried their best to destroy the 
investigation

jewish settlers today 
demonstrated to protest the stabbing death of a usborn settler in 
the occupied west bank and to demand harsher government measures to 
quell the palestinian uprising 
the military command today extended the closure of west bank 
schools for another month despite pleas from the united states and 
human rights groups to reopen them 
the 1194 schools including 145 kindergardens have been closed 
for all but a few weeks since feb 3 1988 keeping 320000 pupils 
out of classrooms 
in the occupied gaza strip six palestinians were wounded in 
clashes in the bureij and nusseirat refugee camps including a 
65yearold man struck in the knee arab doctors said 
outside the ariel settlement the home of the fatal stabbing 
victim 150 demonstrators waved israeli flags and some shouted 
how many jews have to die before something is done 
in jerusalem 80 jewish settlers blocked the entrance to the 
knesset to protest the slaying of friedrich steven rosenfeld 
fistfights occurred when knesset guards ordered the protesters to 
disperse army radio said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir blamed palestinians for the slaying 
of rosenfeld 48 and said punishment would be swift and harsh 
this murder is another link in the chain of blood of violent 
actions carried out against us in the country by murderers and 
rioters who believe that by these actions they will put an end to 
our settlement and our existence he said israels security 
forces will uproot this violence with an iron fist 
chaim malka a west bank police commander said police suspected 
palestinians in the slaying but he said all possibilities would be 
investigated the army said it was checking the reports 
rosenfelds body was found on sunday by palestinian shepherds on 
a hilltop between the arab villages of salfit and burkin said avivi 
shalom head of security in ariel shalom said rosenfeld had been 
stabbed in the back 
rosenfeld had been missing since friday night 
shalom said rosenfeld apparently walked to the barren area from 
ariel 
it seems as though the assailants surprised him and hit him on 
the head shalom told the associated press rosenfelds empty 
pistol holster map binoculars and two spent cartridges were found 
near the body shalom said 
the maariv daily said it appeared the settler had been taken by 
surprise and fired in the direction of the assailants 
ariel officials said rosenfeld lived in washington dc before 
emigrating to israel in 1968 he served in the israeli army and was 
wounded in march 1968 when his jeep hit a land mine while on patrol 
the officials said 
rosenfeld lived in tel aviv and worked as an editor of technical 
manuals before moving to ariel 18 months ago 
ariel spokesman dina shalit said rosenfeld was a nature lover and 
frequent organizer of hikes for residents in the settlement of 
5000 she said he may have been mapping a hiking route when he was 
killed 
he was just walking on the hill looking at nature he wasnt 
disturbing anyone he died just because he was jewish shalom said 
before rosenfelds death 22 israelis had been killed during the 
18month palestinian uprising against israels occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip at least 524 palestinians have also died 
the army placed curfews on burkin and salfit and launched a 
manhunt deploying helicopters scouts and search dogs 
outside the ariel settlement its mayor ron nachman told 
protesters that the government created an atmosphere against 
settlers about 70000 jews live among the 17 million palestinians 
in the occupied territories 
all of them are responsible and especially the knesset members 
who speak out and put a stigma on us as a group in order to enable 
attacks on us i see them as directly responsible for this 
assassination nachman said

the unabashedly abrasive morton downey jr says 
he is trying to buy his show and turn it into a weekly program to 
avoid cancellation 
my position is and always has been that five times a week is 
overexposure for this type of persona he said in todays new york 
times 
the talk show has been nationally syndicated for a year and is on 
71 stations but not enough stations are renewing the 
fivedayaweek version 
last week downey told the daily news that the show has been sold 
for the coming year in 22 markets but needs at least 60 to get 
renewed 
no one will take a chance on it any more he said 
downey one of a spate of talk show hosts whose emotional style 
and sensational topics have earned their shows the nickname 
tabloid tv told the times he hoped to purchase the show with 
partners and revise it 
the times said executives for quantum media inc which produces 
the show believe downeys offcamera behavior has hurt the program 
in april for example he claimed he was attacked in san 
francisco by neonazis but police there said they were unable to 
substantiate the claim 
downey doesnt get as good ratings as the oprah winfrey 
show donahue and geraldo 
all three are carried by about three times the number of stations 
that carry downey and regularly rank in the top 10 nationally 
syndicated programs downeys show ranked no 84 this past season 
according to the ac nielsen co 
the program premiered at a new jersey station nearly two years 
ago

a multiple killer who murdered a 
transient because he just got in my way was executed by 
injection today after thanking his guards for letting me die with 
dignity 
william paul thompson 52 was pronounced dead at 209 am he 
gave no final statement but talked with guards as he lay on a gurney 
in nevadas former gas chamber then stared at a ceiling fan as the 
injection was administered 
the 300pound thompson spent the hours before his execution 
talking with a minister and with a fellow deathrow inmate who is 
scheduled to die later this week officials said 
he was the third person put to death in nevada and the 112th in 
the nation since executions resumed in 1977 counting thompson 
eight murderers have been executed this year 
in the only death row interview he granted thompson told the 
associated press on saturday that he had recently found religion and 
was paying back to society the only thing i have to offer it 
when you give everything you got that should be enough he 
said my death is payment to everyone ive ever hurt my family 
the victims families 
thompson said he didnt want to stop his execution because hes 
ready to die and might kill again if he remained alive defense 
attorneys and the american civil liberties union filed no 
lastminute petitions and no eleventhhour court reviews were held 
theyre letting a guilty man die with dignity he said in the 
interview i never thought id be thanking someone for letting me 
die never in a million years 
his last words struck the same theme according to warden pete 
demosthenes as guards closed the death chamber door thompson said 
thank you for letting me die with dignity the warden also said 
thompson was very resigned to this 
thompson convicted of three murders said he was the hitman in 
other contract murders he said one victim was a federal prosecutor 
in oklahoma in 1983 
in tulsa okla us attorney tony graham said he wasnt aware 
of any prosecutor in the state who had disappeared or was killed in 
1983 graham said thompsons statement sounds somewhat 
preposterous and he didnt intend to investigate the claim 
bill price who recently stepped down as us attorney in 
oklahoma city said if a federal prosecutor had been killed in 
oklahoma i would definitely know about it that claim is 
categorically false 
the other murders were in new york and in kansas thompson said 
he wouldnt reveal the names of the victims or the people who hired 
him 
thompson declined further interviews prison officials said 
thompson was sentenced to die for the 1984 killing of randy 
waldron a 28yearold transient in reno after that sentence he 
was convicted of killing robert pariset 35 and parisets 
28yearold brother john who were camping near auburn calif 
thompson said waldron just got in my way while he was on the 
run from the killings of the brothers he said he shot the brothers 
because they were drug informants 
he said his life of crime and alcoholism started at age 12 in 
texas he said he spent more than half his life behind bars

the nations health chief and its largest group of 
doctors are on a collision course over a plan by the bush 
administration to curb skyrocketing health care costs 
dr louis sullivan secretary of the department of health and 
human services reiterated the administrations support for 
expenditure targets during a private meeting sunday with the 
american medical associations board of trustees 
the forum was on the opening day of the amas fiveday 
policymaking session where dr james h sammons the associations 
executive vice president called the proposal rationing of 
medical care 
under the proposal the government would set maximum levels for 
reimbursing fees of doctors who treat medicare patients the amount 
by which fees exceed the target level would be cut from the next 
years budget an ama official said 
sammons said in a speech to more than 1000 ama members he has 
personally communicated the medical professions obections to 
the white house and to sullivan 
sullivan did not mention the plan in addressing those at the 
meeting he told reporters later he was trying to avoid a 
confrontational approach 
what we are trying to do is get a handle on the escalation 
of medical costs he said 
the united states per capita expenditures for health care are 
the highest in the world using more than 11 percent of the gross 
national product and they continue to rise at an unsustainable 
rate sullivan told the convention 
yet the united states lags far behind other industrialized 
countries in some basic health indices including average life 
expectancy and maternal mortality he said 
we have an infant mortality rate of 104 deaths per thousand 
live births which ranks our nation 19th among industrialized 
countries of the western world he said 
in his speech sammons criticized delays by the bush 
administration in filling key national health care positions 
six months into the administration we do not have any 
political leadership in the health care financing administration 
the post of assistant secretary for health affairs at the pentagon 
is vacant beginning july 13th the position of surgeon general of 
the public health service will be vacant he said 
this is no way to usher america in to the health care arena in 
the final decade of the 20th century 
sullivan said the administration is concerned about the vacancies 
but he argued that they do not signal a lack of leadership 
both acknowledged that us health care is in trouble but said 
reforms rather than a complete overhaul will cure the problems 
sammons cited a report to be presented this week by the amas 
board of trustees its governing body criticizing the nationalized 
health care program in canada 
the report says programs such as canadas highly touted system 
fail to address the needs of patients and doctors and wont work in 
the united states 
some doctors started a movement this year seeking adoption of a 
system similar to canadas in which individuals and employers are 
taxed to pay for health coverage for all 
but the board is highly critical of the system saying all 
responsibility for health care payment is placed on the government 
in theory canadians have an ideal health care system a 
comprehensive system of primary care removal of all financial 
barriers to access to primary care decentralization of health 
programs and professional standards of care equal to or better than 
those of most western countries the board said in its report 
but in many important ways canadas system is lacking 
canadas program is less responsive to consumers than the us 
system adoption of major medical technologies lags far behind the 
united states there are growing backlogs for a variety of surgical 
and emergency procedures it does not reward or encourage high 
performance by providers it is rigid and inflexible according to 
the report

voters rejected premier andreas 
papandreous scandalplagued socialist government and thousands of 
people rallied in the streets today to cheer the conservative 
opposition that finished first 
but the centerright new democracy party of constantine 
mitsotakis failed to capture a majority meaning the conservatives 
will have to try to forge a coalition with other parties or else 
call new elections 
official results from 18491 of the 20081 voting precincts 
clearly indicated that mitsotakis party would fall far short of the 
parliamentary majority needed to make him the next premier 
government computer projections indicated that in sundays vote 
his party would win 144 of the 300 seats in parliament papandreous 
panhellenic socialist movement 125 the coalition of left and 
progress 29 and one each for the conservative democratic renewal 
and a greekmoslem of turkish origin from northeastern greece 
the ministry of interior said today that with more than 90 
percent of the ballots counted new democracy was getting 4443 
percent of the vote and papandreous party also known as pasok 
3907 percent the coalition of left and progress had 1297 percent 
and the rest was split among minor parties and independents 
official figures showed that new democracy received 2655580 
votes pasok 2335123 and the coalition of the left and progress 
775403 abstention was running about 21 percent of the 789 million 
eligible voters 
new democracy has toppled pasok from the government 
mitsotakis told thousands of screaming supporters from the steps of 
party headquarters as dawn rose over the capital tens of thousands 
of supporters celebrated in the streets of central athens 
as the results trickled in shortly after the polls closed sunday 
night gloom set in at the socialist camp the atmosphere was muted 
at papandreous suburban home his party headquarters in central 
athens closed early 
a welllaid buffet in the garden of papandreous spacious villa 
remained untouched as pasok supporters and friends scowled at a 
television set broadcasting election results 
the conservatives are first and pasok is second a gaunt and 
tiredlooking papandreou told reporters and guests gathered in the 
garden 
papandreou has governed greece for eight years and swallowed a 
bitter pill today when he acknowledged he could not defeat 
mitsotakis who advocates closer us ties and less economic 
controls than the premier 
papandreou nevertheless thanked supporters for denying an 
absolute majority to the forces of conservatism 
his government has been rocked by financial and arms scandals 
that led to the firings or resignations of eight cabinet members 
the 70yearold papandreou also was hurt by a divorce from his 
americanborn wife margaret and his affair with a former airline 
stewardess half his age 
still mitsotakis lack of a majority left papandreou with a 
chance to salvage a third fouryear term at the helm of greeces 
turbulent politics 
when there is no majority the constitution requires the 
president to give the leading party three days to form a governing 
coalition 
mitsotakis is expected to meet with president christos 
sartzetakis on tuesday if mitsotakis fails to muster enough 
support pasok and then the coalition of left and progress must be 
given the chance 
should all efforts fail the president can form a caretaker 
government and call new elections papandreou remains premier until 
efforts to form a coalition are exhausted 
the premier refused to answer questions about a coalition today 
but hinted at the possibility by noting that leftist parties pasok 
and the coalition would have a majority 
before sundays vote both papandreou and mitsotakis said that in 
forming a government they would reject support from the communists 
the coalition had hoped to emerge as a third force in greek 
politics and a power broker in any negotiations for a new government 
papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to lead greece out of 
nato and the european economic community and to close us military 
bases around the country his maverick foreign policy created a new 
pride in a country accustomed to feeling like a poor cousin of the 
rich west 
however he now supports membership in both nato and the ecc and 
is negotiating a new base agreement with the americans 
mitsotakis 71 who calls himself an advocate of a freemarket 
economy campaigned with promises to clean up the scandals and put 
the ailing economy back on track inflation is running at 14 percent 
the biggest scandal has centered on fugitive banker george 
koskotas he is charged with swindling more than 200 million from 
the bank of crete to build a publishing empire and buy a top greek 
soccer team 
koskotas has accused papandreou of masterminding the plan to loot 
the bank as a way of financing his election campaign the premier 
has denied any wrongdoing

a bomb exploded outside the 
living quarters of a british military barracks in osnabrueck today 
causing extensive damage but no injuries a military spokesman said 
no one immediately claimed responsibility but west german 
authorities said they suspected the irish republican army was 
responsible 
the two suspected attackers fled after they were surprised by a 
west german employee at the barracks 
the employee was hit in the face and investigators later found 
four more unexploded bombs containing plastic explosives at the 
barracks officials said 
col henry day of the british forces headquarters in west germany 
said the bomb exploded at 110 am at quebec barracks 100 miles 
north of duesseldorf 
the bombing came five days after west german officials indicted 
two alleged ira members for earlier attacks on the british military 
in west germany 
british military authorities first said property damage in 
todays blast was slight but a spokesman later said the damage was 
extensive 
a military spokesman in osnabrueck who requested anonymity said 
the blast caused severe damage to the onestory building 
he said the explosion blew a hole from ground level to the roof 
of the building measuring about eight feet in diameter 
it also blew out numerous windows in the area he said 
the unidentified west german employer was treated at a local 
hospital for facial scratches and bruises the spokesman said

a california woman facing criminal charges in 
her daughters death because she tried to heal the child through 
prayer rather than seeking medical help lost a supreme court appeal 
today 
the justices without comment refused to block the womans trial 
in sacramento on charges of childendangerment and involuntary 
manslaughter 
the high court has turned away similar appeals previously 
laurie walker a christian scientist chose to treat with prayer 
rather than medical attention her 4yearold daughter shauntay 
when the girl became ill with flulike symptoms on feb 21 1984 
and four days later developed a stiff neck 
ms walker contacted an accredited prayer practitioner from her 
church and a christian science nurse to attend the child but 
shauntay nevertheless lost weight and grew disoriented 
the young girl died march 9 of meningitis 
californias childneglect law does not allow prosecution of 
parents who provide prayer rather than medical care for their 
children but prosecutors charged ms walker with childendangerment 
and involuntary manslaughter if convicted she could receive a 
maximum sentence of six years in prison 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for ms walker contended 
that the conflicting state laws result in a denial of fair 
warning for christian scientists 
referring to mixed signals or deliberate ambiguity in the 
criminal law the appeal said such prosecutions amount to trials 
of faith forbidden by the constitution 
the california supreme court last nov 10 rejected arguments that 
forcing ms walker to stand trial would violate her religious 
freedom 
an adequately effective and less restrictive alternative is not 
available to further the states compelling interest in assuring the 
provision of medical care to gravely ill children whose parents 
refuse such treatment on religious grounds the state court said 
the first amendment protecting religious freedom and its 
california equivalent do not bar defendants criminal prosecution 
it said 
but the state court added whether this defendants particular 
conduct was sufficiently culpable to justify conviction of 
involuntary manslaughter and felony child endangerment remains a 
question in the exclusive province of the jury 
the case is walker vs superior court 881471

the nations roman catholic church 
which has lost tens of thousands of minority members to conservative 
protestant groups in recent years is fighting back 
the president of the national conference of catholic bishops 
charged during the prelates annual spring meeting that some of the 
nations largest protestant denominations including the southern 
baptist convention have worked to convert hispanics 
archbishop john l may of st louis said fundamentalist churches 
have a very clearly fashioned plan to entice people away from the 
church in a very deceptive way 
i think thats an unfair statement the rev daniel vestal 
pastor at dunwoody baptist church in atlanta and the unsuccessful 
candidate last week for president of the 145 millionmember 
southern baptist convention said sunday 
i cant speak for all protestant groups but i know the southern 
baptists offer a message of hope and redemption that attracts 
people regardless of race 
at their meeting at seton hall university the bishops voted to 
emphasize evangelism when they celebrate in 1992 the 500th 
anniversary of the introduction of catholicism to the americas and 
to start work toward giving blacks a greater role in the church 
leaders of the nations largest religious denomination also 
approved a resolution calling for normalization of us relations 
with vietnam and a plan for resolving disputes between bishops and 
theologians 
after two days of business meetings the bishops held a day of 
recollection sunday gathering for mass the bishops were to meet in 
executive session today to conclude the meeting 
may said some fundamentalist churches go so far as to feature 
catholic art and music in their churches to draw hispanics in and 
then start teaching anticatholic doctrines to keep the converts 
from returning to catholicism 
a wave of immigrants from spanishspeaking countries and a 
relatively high birth rate have made hispanics the fastestgrowing 
group of us catholics making up an estimated third of the 53 
millionmember denomination due in part to immigration from the 
west indies and haiti the number of black catholics has risen from 
900000 to 2 million during the past 20 years 
but the rev allan figueroa deck associate professor of hispanic 
studies at the jesuit school of theology at berkeley university 
said one national study has shown at least 60000 hispanics leave 
the church each year and 1 million have left during the past 15 
years 
church leaders said a large part of the losses particularly in 
the hispanic community are the result of proselytizing by 
conservative protestant churches 
catholic officials though also admit the church has driven some 
minority members away through apathy and insensitivity 
deck said that while hispanic catholics struggle to be noticed in 
the catholic church evangelical sects are providing numerous 
spanishspeaking ministers and small churches especially 
appropriate for immigrants who need all the personal communal 
support they can get 
a pastoral statement proposed by the nations 13 black prelates 
calls for giving blacks more positions of responsibility throughout 
the church and integrating africanamerican cultural symbols into 
liturgies and churches 
sister thea bowman of canton miss a black nun said in an 
emotional appeal to the bishops that black catholics sometimes feel 
like a motherless child in the church 
the black and hispanic bishops met thursday to begin what they 
said would be an ongoing dialogue one of their first actions was to 
send a telegram to president bush expressing regret over his recent 
veto of minimumwage legislation 
but the average catholic may find it hard to draw others into 
church 
archbishop edward a mccarthy of miami said a recent gallup poll 
showed only 2 percent of catholics are involved in evangelization 
on vietnam the conference approved a statement from the bishops 
committee on international policy asking the nation to begin to heal 
the wounds caused by the war and start the process of resuming 
diplomatic ties with its former enemy

authorities today announced they would create 
200000 jobs clean up polluting factories and grow more food in a 
region where economic and ecological problems were blamed for 
rioting that killed about 100 people 
the communist party newspaper pravda also reported that the last 
of more than 16000 meskhi turks had been evacuated from the fergana 
valley in the republic of uzbekistan 
rioting that broke out in the central asian republic pitted 
ethnic uzbeks against the meskhi minority which was forcibly 
resettled in the valley by soviet dictator josef stalin in 1944 
authorities and residents have given differing accounts of the 
reasons for the sudden outbreak of arson and killings on june 3 that 
required 9000 interior ministry soldiers and evacuation of the 
meskhi turks to contain 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov said about 100 people were killed in 
the violence hundreds of homes were destroyed by arsonists 
officials have blamed groups of marauders for the violence and 
said an investigation was under way to find out who they are 
uzbeks and meskhi turks said they have been frustrated by a lack 
of work agricultural and industrial pollution and quotas requiring 
them to grow cotton rather than food products 
the leader of an uzbek grassroots movement called the 
governments move to improve the economy and environment a good step 
but added that it was late and the he doubted the government could 
create those jobs by 1990 as it promised 
this is very positive but they had to think about it much 
earlier abdurakhim pulatov said in a telephone interview from 
tashkent the uzbekistan capital pulatov 44 who heads the berlik 
movement said he did not believe 200000 jobs could be created so 
quickly 
he blamed the violence on the worsening of the socioeconomic 
situation of the native population unemployment poverty and 
social injustice 
some reports in the uzbekistan media have accused the berlik 
movement of being behind the violence pulatov denied that 
pravda quoting a uzbekistan government report said food 
processing plants and sewing factories would be opened to provide 
200000 new jobs by the end of 1990 
the newspaper said steps would be taken to end the concentration 
on cotton production some activists charge that the chemical 
fertilizers and pesticides used in cotton production is poisoning 
the land and leading to malnutrition in a republic once known for 
its fruits and vegetables 
to heal the ecological situation technology at polluting 
enterprises will be modernized and reliable pollution control 
devices will be created pravda said without elaboration 
the newspaper said there was no information about new arson 
pogroms or murders in reports by military commanders 
pravda said an ilyushin76 transport plane took the final group 
of meskhi turks to central russia on sunday ending the evacuation 
of 16282 people 
the turks were evacuated from their homes in fergana and other 
cities in the valley to a camp where shelter food and water were in 
short supply 
official newspapers on june 12 reported that rioters had tried to 
attack the camp and were driven off by soldiers 
the meskhi turks are natives of an area of the soviet republic of 
georgia which borders turkey for more than 30 years they have been 
demanding that they be allowed to return ryzhkov promised the 
government will study the demand

the supreme court today barred asbestos 
manufacturers from suing the government to recover money they paid 
to a navy shipyard worker injured by inhaling the product 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by two 
manufacturers in a case from washington state 
albert lopez worked as a pipe fitter pipe coverer and insulator 
at the puget sound naval shipyard in washington from 1947 to 1984 
eaglepicher industries inc settled a claim against it by paying 
lopez 10000 raymark industries inc did the same for 7200 
both manufacturers supplied asbestos to the navy to insulate 
ships 
lopezs claims were used in the lower courts as a test case of 
the governments liability for injuries suffered by shipyard workers 
a federal appeals court here ruled last september that the 
manufacturers lack any legal basis to recover from the government 
the money they pay to settle asbestosrelated claims against them 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the government by 
ordering asbestos in effect insured the manufacturers against 
lawsuits by injured workers 
the appeals court said the manufacturers seem to be suggesting 
that the government knew more about the hazards of asbestos than 
it ever disclosed to its suppliers 
the manufacturers appear to be arguing that if they knew of the 
dangers they would have gone out of the asbestos business at once 
and saved themselves untold liability or else would have purchased 
all the insurance available and passed the cost on in sharply 
higher prices the appeals court said 
we may have to suppress our wonderment that anyone would have 
known more about the hazards of asbestos than those responsible 
companies who used it as raw material the court continued 
but it added even if the government knew more about the dangers 
of asbestos than the manufacturers there still is no legal basis 
for the companies to recover the money 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject the 
companies appeal 
justice department lawyers noted that the high court ruled last 
year that defense contractors are immune from personalinjury 
lawsuits when they follow government specifications and warn the 
government of any dangers of which they are aware 
but that ruling does not shield manufacturers of products found 
to cause injury independent of government specifications for their 
use the government lawyers said 
the cases are eaglepicher vs us 881382 and raymark vs 
us 881418

a retiring fbi agent says he knows who killed 
jimmy hoffa but cant say 
im comfortable i know who did it but its never going to be 
prosecuted because we would have to divulge informants confidential 
sources kenneth p walton fbi chief in detroit from 1985 to 
1988 said in sundays detroit news 
there was more than one person who killed jimmy hoffa or was 
involved in the efforts but we cant force a source for example 
to testify said the 24year agent 
walton declined to be specific but said some informants and 
suspects are dead 
hoffas son said the fbi could ease the familys pain by 
dispelling some of the mystery surrounding the 1975 disappearance of 
the former teamsters boss 
i think it is incumbent upon the fbi if in fact they do know 
who was involved in the slaying of my father that they share that 
information with the family james hoffa said in todays detroit

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
former maryland gov marvin mandels 1977 mailfraud conviction 
thrown out five years after he completed a prison term 
the court without comment rejected a bush administration appeal 
aimed at using mandels case to set guidelines on when someone may 
challenge a fraud conviction for which the sentence already was 
served 
mandel and five others were convicted of charges stemming from an 
alleged scheme in which the governor supported legislation favorable 
to marlboro race track in return for gifts worth more than 380000 
the race tracks five owners w dale hess harry w rodgers 
iii william a rodgers irvin kovens and ernest n cory also were 
convicted in 1977 their convictions also were thrown out after they 
had completed their respective sentences 
the government appeal acted on today also sought to reinstate 
those five convictions 
at mandels trial prosecutors charged that mandel used his 
influence as governor to help the track jurors were told by the 
judge that mandel could be convicted of mail fraud if they found 
that mandel had deprived citizens of their intangible rights to 
his honest services 
mandel was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison he 
had served 19 months when the remainder was commuted he also was 
disbarred because of the conviction 
hess served 18 months of a threeyear sentence and paid 40000 
in fines harry rodgers and kovens each served three years in prison 
and paid 40000 in fines william rodgers served his yearandaday 
sentence and paid 40000 in fines corys 18month sentence was 
suspended 
the supreme court in 1987 deciding an unrelated case ruled that 
federal mail fraud law does not protect against schemes to defraud 
people of their intangible rights such as the right to honest 
government 
mandel and the five others then sought to have their convictions 
thrown out and the paid fines returned a federal judge granted that 
relief and the ruling was upheld last dec 7 by the a 21 vote of 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said it could not determine whether the 
convictions had been based on the intangible rights aspect or 
some other aspect not affected by the supreme courts 1987 ruling 
in a case in which the jury considers alternate theories of 
liability we must reverse the convictions if either theory is an 
improper basis for punishment the 4th circuit court said 
that ruling conflicts with one issued by another federal appeals 
court the 7th us circuit court of appeals recently upheld the 
conviction of former chicago councilman thomas e keane for 
conspiring illegally to buy and sell taxdelinquent properties 
the 7th circuit court ruled that keane was not entitled to have 
his conviction overturned even though jurors had been instructed 
about the sinceinvalidated intangible rights aspect of federal 
mail fraud law because other evidence could support a conviction 
the supreme court on may 22 refused to hear keanes appeal 
in the mandel case acted on today government lawyers said the 
justices should clear up the considerable confusion in the lower 
courts as to when such convictions should be overturned 
the case is us vs mandel 881759

solidarity continued its domination of 
polands national elections today by winning eight of the nine seats 
still left open to the opposition in a parliamentary runoff 
but voters demonstrated widespread apathy to races in which only 
communist candidates were competing only in races featuring 
solidaritybacked candidates did turnout exceed 25 percent 
sundays runoff elections were for candidates who failed to draw 
at least 50 percent of the vote during the initial round on june 4 
because of the poor communist showing in the early round most of 
the runoff races featured only communist candidates and their 
contests were widely ignored 
final results were not expected until tuesday but the low voter 
turnout in the contested communist races and solidaritys continued 
success was another setback for the government 
also it was apparent from unofficial returns that progressive 
communists were besting hardliners in several races 
the postelection shock has brought about a need for a deep 
analysis of the situation politburo member leszek miller said in 
an interview with the communist party newspaper trybuna ludu today 
the party is faced with the most serious problems in its whole 
history 
solidarity was allowed run for all seats in the newly created 
100member senate and 35 percent of the seats in the existing sejm 
in the first round it won 92 seats in the senate and 160 of the 161 
it was alloted in the sejm 
based on unofficial projections from sundays runoff balloting 
solidarity picked up an additional seven seats in the senate 
giving it 99 out of 100 seats and the one seat still available to 
it in the sejm 
the victory sunday of henryk stoklosa a rich fodder farmer 
backed by the communists prevented a solidarity sweep of the senate 
stoklosa had waged polands most expensive election campaign 
ever plastering his district in the western province of pila with a 
westernstyle advertising blitz and hosting picnics with free beer 
and sausages 
the state election commission estimated nationwide turnout in 
sundays second round at 2531 percent the lowest on record in 
postwar poland turnout was higher only in the six provinces with 
solidarity candidates 
the communists because they were guaranteed a majority under the 
historic april accord that allowed the solidarityled opposition to 
compete in the elections will have 299 seats in the sejm to 
solidaritys 161 
the senate has veto power over laws passed in the sejm but 
because solidarity won all of the seats alloted to it in the sejm 
that body would be unable to generate the twothirds majority needed 
to override a senate veto 
several promininet communists including warsaw party leader 
janusz kubaszewicz manfred gorywoda leader of the southern 
industrial region of katowice and construction minister bogumil 
ferensztajn were among the communist candidates who failed to win 
sejm seats in the second round all three are considered hardliners 
but communistcoalition candidates who received backing from 
local solidarity committees did well among those elected were 
former gdansk party leader tadeusz fizbach a liberal who signed the 
agreements in 1980 that first legalized solidarity and andrzej 
bratkowski a brother of a prominent opposition journalist 
solidarity sought to build its power in the sejm by taking the 
unusual step of endorsing the most reformoriented communist 
coalition hopefuls 
union leader lech walesa voting before church near his gdansk 
home said the real game looking from the point of view of 
solidarity has already taken place the staterun pap news agency 
reported 
but he said he encourged participation because one should elect 
people who are in favor of reform 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski said as he voted in warsaw 
that ending the predetermined elections of the past was a risk 
for the ruling communists but was necessary if reform is to 
succeed so far what is important is that we are talking to each 
other jaruzelski said 
even before the voting ended attention had started to focus on 
the government changes expected to follow 
the communist party plans a central committee meeting at the end 
of the month to decide on a candidate for the new post of president 
who will in turn nominate the next prime minister 
solidarity too must take its stand on the presidency and decide 
what role it will play when it takes its place in the national 
assembly

margaret randall a professor and writer 
threatened with deportation from the united states for supporting 
communism lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that it is 
premature to consider the constitutional and legal issues she raised 
her appeal is supported by a number of prominent writers 
including norman mailer arthur miller toni morrison william 
styron and kurt vonnegut 
ms randall lost her us citizenship after leaving this country 
in 1961 she lived in mexico cuba and nicaragua writing about 
social change and revolution in third world nations 
she returned to this country on a visitors visa in 1984 and has 
been living in albuquerque nm near her elderly parents while 
teaching at the university of new mexico 
ms randall applied for permanent resident status in 1984 a step 
toward regaining her us citizenship but the application was 
rejected by an official of the immigration and naturalization 
service in el paso texas 
the official based the rejection on ms randalls association 
with and her activities and writing in support of the 
communistdominated governments of cuba north vietnam and 
nicaragua the official said those activities and writings go 
far beyond mere dissent 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year that it is 
premature for the federal courts to consider the merits of ms 
randalls case 
the appeals court said it is likely she never will be deported 
and because of a change in federal law it appears she eventually 
will be allowed to regain her citizenship 
the appeals court noted that a move to block her deportation is 
pending before the us board of immigration appeals 
the appeals court also pointed out that congress in 1988 
generally made it illegal to deny a visa or an application for 
permanent resident status to anyone based on their beliefs 
statements or associations 
it therefore appears that the larger question initially raised 
whether margaret randall could regain united states citizenship 
is now reduced to the question when can she regain it the 
appeals court said 
her lawyers argued that postponing her opportunity to regain 
citizenship is causing her serious harm 
the case is randall vs thornburgh 881412

the supreme court today barred additional us 
compensation to inhabitants of the marshall islands for the effects 
of nuclearweapons testing there more than 30 years ago 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out a 
lawsuit by residents of the pacific island republic 
us and marshall island officials signed an agreement in 1983 
requiring the united states to set up a 150 million fund with 
annual interest paid to those affected by nuclear testing conducted 
from 1946 to 1958 
the pact also created a tribunal to award additional funds to 
those with valid claims 
island residents were evacuated before the tests which vaporized 
five islands and made the area unfit for habitation for 33 years 
residents living on other islands downwind from the blasts moved out 
as recently as 1985 for fear of continued radiation 
a federal appeals court here ruled that the 1983 agreement 
supported by legislation that took effect in 1986 bars island 
inhabitants from suing the united states for additional compensation 
we are unpersuaded that judicial intervention is appropriate at 
this time on the mere speculation that the alternative remedy may 
prove to be inadequate the appeals court said 
the case is people of enewetak vs us 881466

ussoviet talks on cutting longrange nuclear 
forces reopened today after a sevenmonth recess with few prospects 
of an early breakthrough in the 4yearold negotiations 
while washington reportedly planned to press moscow over the 
inspection provisions of a future treaty both sides have indicated 
no change in their stands on other major oustanding issues 
the two new chief delegates richard burt and yuri nazarkin 
launched the 11th round of geneva talks since march 1985 with a 
meeting at the us mission 
after the 80minute session burt told reporters he had outlined 
president bushs overall approach to arms control emphasizing the 
presidents commitment to reducing the risk of nuclear war 
i hope we will make some progress he said 
nazarkin said im satisfied it was a good start he said 
moscow may put forth new proposals in due time he did not 
elaborate 
burt a military expert and former us ambassador to west 
germany replaced veteran arms negotiator max kampelman 
nazarkin replaced alexei obukhov and had been chief soviet envoy 
at the 40nation conference on disarmament which has been seeking 
for years to complete a treaty banning chemical weapons worldwide 
along with the strategic arms reduction talks negotiators will 
resume talks on space and defense issues detailed negotiations are 
due to begin wednesday with a full meeting of both delegations at 
the soviet mission 
the session expected to last six weeks comes against the 
backdrop of recent progress and superpower initiatives in talks on 
conventional disarmament in europe 
resumption of the talks was delayed by the bush administrations 
review of national security policy during the reagan presidency 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday there will 
be a considerable degree of continuity in the us position while 
not ruling out some adjustments 
one new element is a us proposal for onsite trial inspections 
to monitor some cuts of longrange ballistic missiles already 
written into a draft treaty washington officials said a pentagon 
official said bush wants to take advantage of the new soviet 
openness 
it would be the first time in superpower arms control that 
verification begins during talks rather than once a treaty is 
completed 
but neither side has hinted at movement on disputes over the 
pentagons spacebased star wars missile defense sealaunched 
cruise missiles and mobile landbased missiles 
the soviets say the us missile shield or strategic defense 
initiative violates the 1972 superpower antiballistic missile 
treaty 
and disputes have developed over moscows demand for including 
seabased cruise missiles under the treaty and washingtons call for 
a ban on mobile missiles 
admiral william j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff has predicted protracted and agonizing negotiations 
much of a draft treaty to cut each sides longrange or 
strategic nuclear forces by 30 to 50 percent has been agreed in 
previous rounds 
start is intended to cover nuclear weapons with which the 
superpowers can strike each other including those considered most 
dangerous sea and landbased ballistic missiles and heavy bombers 
delegates are to begin the new session by reviewing agreements 
already contained in the 400page draft text 
among the agreements in earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of 
6000 nuclear warheads and 1600 delivery vehicles missiles and 
bombers for each side outlines of a system for monitoring 
compliance were also set

archbishop gregorio rosa chavez 
criticized a rightwing proposal to virtually outlaw criticism of 
the government 
the socalled law in defense of democracy contradicts its 
name the roman catholic prelate said during his sunday homily 
it prescribes a medicine worse than the disease and could 
take el salvador back to the dark times of the early 1980s when 
death squads killed thousands of people considered government 
critics he said 
arena the rightist republican nationalist alliance drafted a 
law providing fines and imprisonment for those who oppose the 
government or its policies including journalists and protest 
marchers 
president alfredo cristianis new administration was to introduce 
the bill in the national assembly on thursday but it failed to 
without explaining why 
rosa chavez said the proposal takes a partisan view of the 
violence in el salvador because it treats terrorism as something 
committed only by leftists 
human rights and international organizations say rightist death 
squads and the military are responsible for the majority of civilian 
deaths in nine years of civil war about 70000 people mainly 
civilians have died in the war between the usbacked government 
and leftwing guerrillas 
rosa chavez said terrorism also includes terrorism of the 
state 
he said vice president dan quayle in a meeting with roman 
catholic church leaders during his recent visit to el salvador 
spoke of liberty of democracy but not of justice he didnt 
touch on the problem of injustice

the supreme court today refused to hear the 
appeal of one of five men convicted in a scheme to bribe thenus 
sen howard cannon of nevada 
the justices without comment let stand joseph lombardos 
bribery conspiracy and wire fraud conviction for which he was 
sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined 
lombardos codefendants were roy l williams president of the 
central conference of teamsters allen dorfman a former special 
consultant to the teamsters central states pension fund thomas f 
omalley a pension fund trustee and andrew g massa a former 
pension fund trustee 
a federal appeals court said that lombardos vocation at the time 
as something of a mystery 
the 1982 convictions arose out of what prosecutors said was a 
scheme to sell a piece of las vegas property to cannon the senator 
was not charged in the case 
the property known as wonderworld and owned by the union pension 
fund was located across the street from cannons residence 
in late 1978 cannon and a group of neighbors expressed interest 
in purchasing the property to prevent it from being commercially 
developed 
at the time legislation designed to deregulate the trucking 
industry was pending in congress the teamsters opposed the 
deregulation and considered cannon then chairman of the senate 
commerce committee to be in a position to affect the legislations 
future 
prosecutors said williams and dorfman seeking to influence 
cannons actions on the legislation promised to take steps so the 
senators group could purchase the las vegas property from the 
pension fund for 14 million even if higher bids were received 
the property however eventually was sold to an unrelated 
corporation for 16 million 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for lombardo argued that 
his conviction was based solely on a scheme to deprive the pension 
fund of the intangible right to honest service from its trustees 
the supreme court in 1987 ruled that mailfraud convictions could 
not be based on a theory that citizens rights to honest government 
had been violated 
the underlying indictment is fatally defective under the 1987 
ruling lombardos appeal contended 
but justice department lawyers urged the high court to reject the 
appeal they said the jury in convicting lombardo had to find that 
he tried to defraud the union pension fund of real property the 
value of the las vegas property 
although the scheme to sell the property to cannon for 14 
million deprived the pension fund of the loyal services of its 
trustees it also clearly contemplated depriving the pension fund of 
the highest price for the wonderworld property government lawyers 
said 
a federal trial judge and the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
previously rejected lombardos arguments 
the case is lombardo vs us 881616

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
nineyearold lawsuit in which the catawba indian tribe claims 
ownership of 225 square miles of south carolina 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that last january revived the tribes efforts to recover 
some but not all of the claimed land 
the land in dispute encompasses the city of rock hill the town 
of fort mill and several smaller communities 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruling barred the tribe 
from recovering either possession of land or damages from people who 
have held the land for 10 years between july 1 1962 and oct 20 
1980 
but the appeals courts 42 ruling said the catawbas may proceed 
with their effort to recover possession and damages from all others 
in the appeal acted on today south carolina attorney general t 
travis medlock and lawyers for numerous landowners argued that the 
tribe had waited too long before filing its 1980 lawsuit 
if review is not granted now it may be a decade or more before 
this court has the opportunity to completely resolve the potentially 
dispositive deadline issue the appeal said 
years of continuing litigation will result in a cloud on land 
titles requiring innocent citizens to defend their homes and 
businesses in protracted litigation at great expense it added 
the tribes lawsuit contends that an 1840 treaty under which the 
tribe transferred the disputed land to south carolina was invalid 
because the federal government did not participate in or approve the 
treaty 
when congress passed a law that revoked the tribes constitution 
effective july 1 1962 the tribes land claim became subject to 
south carolinas statute of limitations 
medlock and the other lawyers seeking to have the tribes suit 
dismissed contend that the tribe had no longer than 10 years from 
that 1962 date to sue 
the appeal also argued that the catawbas claim to indian 
title is merely a right of occupancy and not legal title 
within the meaning of a south carolina statute 
lawyers for the tribe urged the justices to reject the appeal 
saying the 10year deadline cited by the states lawyers does not 
apply in this case 
they also said the appeals court correctly ruled that under 
federal law indian title is legal title 
the case is south carolina vs catawba indian tribe of south

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
100 million lawsuit against the california highway patrol by the 
parents of a woman raped and killed by a member of the police force 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out the 
civil rights suit 
merlin and june bishop sued after their 23yearold daughter 
robin was killed by patrolman george michael gwaltney on jan 11 
1982 
gwaltney was sentenced to 90 years in prison for depriving ms 
bishop of her civil rights 
prosecutors said gwaltney stopped the young woman while she was 
driving from los angeles to her home in las vegas nev they said he 
handcuffed her raped her in the back seat of his car and then shot 
her 
in their suit the bishops said gwaltneys superior officers were 
aware of his prurient propensities and that he had forced other 
women to have sex with him after stopping them for supposed traffic 
violations 
the suit accused the highway patrol of condoning such conduct as 
long as its officers handed out enough traffic tickets 
gwaltneys antics and attitude were known to his supervisor and 
encouraged as part of a pattern and practice of playboy tolerance 
the bishops said 
a california appeals court threw out the suit last january 
saying it is entirely without merit if not specious 
the appeals court said the federal civil rights law the bishops 
invoked is limited to claims against persons 
there is not a shred of legal authority to support the 
assertion that the state of california is a person the state 
court said 
even if the highway patrol could be sued under the federal civil 
rights law the state court said the bishops would have to show 
that the attack on their daughter was part of its official policy 
the bishops did not and could not allege that the california 
highway patrol had an official policy that its officers should rape 
and kill female motorists the state court said 
the case is bishop vs gwaltney 88527

irans presidential election will be held 
july 28 three weeks earlier than planned and the new president 
will begin his fouryear term before the official october starting 
date iran said today 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said the interior ministry announcement gave no reason for advancing 
the election from the scheduled date of aug 18 
but the move appeared to be aimed at speeding up the transition 
of power following the june 3 death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
and consolidating control under his successor president ali 
khamanei and his likely successor as head of state parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
the interior ministry said that a national referendum on major 
constitutional amendments which had also been scheduled for aug 
18 will be held july 28 as well 
earlier today tehrans radical jomhuri islami daily quoted a 
source as saying the election was moved forward because khamenei had 
been elected as irans supreme leader by the 83member assembly of 
experts which was formed in 1979 to ensure a smooth succession when 
khomeini died 
because of the selection of ayatollah khamenei as leader 
and the need for the election of a president as soon as possible 
the officials in charge of the election proposed the date be brought 
forward the paper said 
the newspaper also said the new president would begin his term 
a little sooner than the scheduled date 
khameneis second term term officially ends oct 5 he is 
forbidden under the 1979 revolutionary constitution from running for 
a third term 
rafsanjani khamaneis political ally in the socalled pragmatist 
camp in tehrans fractious hierarchy is the only declared candidate 
so far the iranian media have in recent days taken his election as 
a foregone conclusion 
rafsanjani who is also commanderinchief of irans armed 
forces has been endorsed by khamenei and several influential 
factions 
analysts have predicted that khamenei 49 and rafsanjani 55 
face challenges from radical rivals such as interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi and possibly khomeinis son ahmad 43 who has 
shown increased political ambitions in recent months 
the pragmatists are said to favor ending irans isolation and 
opening up the economy to wider free enterprise mainly to secure 
foreign aid for irans reconstruction program following a ceasefire 
in the 8year war with iraq 
the antiwestern radicals seek to tighten state control of the 
economy and to retain the goal of spreading khomeinis 
fundamentalist revolution to the moslem world as a bulwark of irans 
foreign policy 
the constitutional amendments which are being formulated by a 
committee appointed by khomeini are widely expected to enhance the 
presidency with more executive powers at the expense of the prime 
ministry to eliminate competing power structures which have snarled 
the decisionmaking process for years 
that would give khamenei and rafsanjani formidable power in the 
postkhomeini era with which to fend off any challenge from the 
radicals

the supreme court today agreed to hear the 
appeal of mississippi death row inmate chandler clemons convicted 
of killing a delivery man who was robbed of 5 in cash and a few 
pizzas 
the justices said they will decide whether clemons was sentenced 
fairly after an appeals court reweighed the aggravating and 
mitigating circumstances present in his case 
clemons appeal said mississippi law gives exclusive sentencing 
authority in capital cases to juries and that the appeals courts 
action therefore violated his rights 
his appeal did not challenge the underlying murder conviction 
prosecutors said clemons plotted with others to rob a pizza 
delivery man and ordered a pizza by telephone to carry out the 
scheme 
clemons used a shotgun to kill arthur shorter prosecutors said 
because he thought shorter might be able to identify him

the supreme court today rejected an appeal in 
which alaska officials sought greater control over indian fishing in 
federal waters within their state 
the court without comment let stand a ruling in favor of the 
kenaitze indian tribe 
the tribe with about 400 members has depended on fishing and 
hunting for its subsistence for hundreds of years 
a federal law enacted in 1980 protects subsistence fishing by 
giving it priority over commercial and sport fishing in federal 
waters in rural areas 
but alaska officials said the changing economy in the kenai 
peninsula near anchorage has transformed the region from a rural 
area 
a 1987 state law defines a rural area as one in which the 
noncommercial customary and traditional use of fish or game for 
personal or family consumption is a principal characteristic of the 
economy 
state officials said that by that standard the recently 
commercialized kenai peninsula is no longer rural 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals said the creative 
redefinition of rural is a transparent move to protect 
commercial and sportfishing interests 
the appeals court noted that the peninsula has some 25000 people 
spread out over an area roughly the size of vermont and new 
hampshire combined 
alaskas definition of rural would exclude practically all 
areas of the united states that we think of as rural including 
virtually the entirety of such farming and ranching states as iowa 
and wyoming the appeals court said 
the alaska attorney generals office said the ruling may deprive 
alaska of control over fishing and hunting in 60 percent of the 
state 
the case is alaska vs kenaitze indian tribe 881642

the supreme court today left intact a fine of 
nearly 1 million against a maryland paper mill operator that failed 
to comply with a federal clean water laws reporting requirements 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to a key 
provision of the act authorizing citizens and environmental groups 
to sue alleged polluters 
simkins industries inc runs a paper mill in catonsville md on 
the banks of the patapsco river 
the sierra club sued the company for failing to monitor and file 
quarterly reports on discharges into the river from aug 1 1981 to 
march 31 1984 
under the federal clean water act the companys permit to 
operate the mill required it to monitor discharges and report them 
simkins faced fines of up to 10000 a day or a total of 977 
million a federal judge assessed penalties of onetenth that 
amount 977000 payable to the us treasury 
there was testimony that the companys plant supervisor did not 
regard sampling of its discharges as a priority 
the sierra club based in california with members nationwide 
charged that simkins had discharged copper into the patapso at 
10000 times the safe levels for fresh water and that oil and 
grease in the river from the mill were twice the allowable limit 
the company said the sierra club did not have the legal authority 
to sue it because the club suffered no direct injury and also that 
the suit should be dismissed because it was filed after simkins 
stopped violating the laws reporting requirements 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last may upheld the fine 
the appeals court said the sierra club established that at least 
one of its members who uses the patapsco river for recreation was 
injured by simkins violations 
fines for failure to monitor and report possible pollution can 
be an important deterrence against future violations the appeals 
court added 
the appeals court citing a 1987 supreme court decision said 
such private citizen suits under the clean water law may not be 
based upon wholly past violations 
the appeals court added that simkins was violating the law at the 
time the suit was filed in late 1984 the company did not file a 
complete quarterly report until january 1985 nearly three months 
after the sierra club filed suit 
it is true that simkins failure to sample occurred solely 
before sierra club filed suit the appeals court said but 
simkins monitoring obgligations were not designed to be a mere 
academic exercise 
unless a permit holder monitors as required it will be 
difficult if not impossible for state and federal officialsto 
know whether or not the permit holder is discharging effluents in 
excess of the permits maximum levels 
the appeals court also noted that simkins began monitoring its 
discharges after it was alerted by the sierra club that it was about 
to be sued 
the case is simkins vs sierra club 88660

the most serious dissident movement in the 
united auto workers in 40 years lost its first test of strength at 
the unions constitutional convention 
amid sometimes raucous debate during sundays opening session 
more than 2000 delegates rejected motions challenging elections 
weeks ago in uaw locals in the detroit area and the southcentral 
united states 
based on sundays voting the dissidents had support from 10 
percent to 20 percent of the delegates 
jerry tucker leader of the dissident movement called new 
directions was philosophical about the setback the decisions 
that may be made here are not necessarily reflective of where the 
rankandfile may be he said 
tuckers movement has charged that the uaw under president owen 
bieber has become too cozy with management new directions is 
pushing a resolution that would force the union to back locals 
opposing labormanagement cooperation 
later this week tucker said new directions will push for 
unionwide rankandfile election of officers 
approval would scrap the representative form the uaw will use to 
reelect bieber to a third threeyear term as leader of the 
1millionmember union bieber is unopposed 
new directions represents the most serious dissident movement in 
the 54yearold uaw since the factionalism of the unions first 
decade walter reuther solidified control of the union after taking 
office in 1946 
in his keynote address before the debate on delegate seating 
bieber blasted the new directions movement without mentioning the 
group by name 
to be frank bieber said i think those who say that 
workers dont want change in the workplace who insist that the old 
ways were always the best ways are insulting the intelligence of 
uaw members 
he defended his leadership saying the union will keep management 
at arms length even while involving itself in joint programs with 
automakers 
so let me assure you and let me warn any employers who may 
have formed the wrong idea of where this union is heading he 
said where the power of persuasion fails we will use the 
persuasion of power without hesitation

prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
party was trounced today by socialists in elections for the european 
parliament 
the labor party inflicting mrs thatchers first defeat in a 
national ballot since she won power 10 years ago seized tory 
districts across the country and won a solid majority of british 
seats in the european economic communitys assembly 
the results were disappointing but we shall renew our efforts 
for next time mrs thatcher said in a letter to conservative 
party chairman peter brooke 
with the economy in trouble labors big 104 percent swing 
against the government fueled charges that mrs thatchers 
freemarket revolution isnt working any more 
weve not done well energy secretary cecil parkinson 
acknowledged this is a warning to the government 
labor leader neil kinnock burst into song in welsh as he arrived 
at the partys london headquarters in the early hours results 
pouring in showed socialists posting gains from scotland to the 
tories southern english heartlands 
labor won 45 of the 78 seats allocated to mainland britain 
compared with its previous total of 32 the conservatives fell to 32 
seats from 45 the scottish national party retained its one seat 
results were expected later today from the three seats in 
britishrun northern ireland where voting splits along protestant 
and roman catholic lines 
the tory share of the vote slumped to 3415 percent compared 
with 42 percent at the 1987 general election when mrs thatcher won 
a third fiveyear term and 408 percent in the last european 
elections in 1984 
labor had 4023 percent up from 308 percent in the 1987 british 
election and up from 365 percent in the 1984 european elections 
in a meteoric performance britains tiny green party scooped up 
15 percent of the vote partly at the expense of the centrist social 
and liberal demoratic party whose share collapsed to 6 percent 
however the british greens will get no seats unlike in other 
west european countries only coming first in a district counts and 
seats are not allocated according to vote share 
although only about onethird of eligible britons voted as is 
traditional in european elections government leaders acknowledged 
that kinnock had succeeded in turning the ballot into a referendum 
on mrs thatcher 
we have got to get inflation under control we have got to 
stick together we have got to make sure the electorate understands 
the consequences of electing a labor government said parkinson 
for labor which has lost three general elections in a row the 
major boost was pushing its vote above the 40 percent it needs to 
oust mrs thatcher at the next general election this must be held 
by mid1992 
these are winning ways and there is more to come kinnock 
told reporters 
fuelled by a credit boom and high wage settlements reminscent of 
the prethatcher era britains 83 percent inflation rate is among 
the highest in the eec union militancy is also growing 
reluctant to raise taxes the thatcher government is trying with 
no sign of success to curb inflation by increasing interest rates 
now at 14 percent and hitting homeowners and businessmen 
the defeat also increased fears within the party that her 
combative stance with other members of the eec is losing votes as 
the 1992 deadline for turning the community into a single market 
approaches

the supreme court today struck down a 
connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs 
no more than it does in three neighboring states 
by a 63 vote the court said such laws unconstitutionally 
interfere with interstate commerce 
this kind of potential regional and even national regulation of 
the pricing mechanism for goods is reserved by the constitutions 
commerce clause to the federal government justice harry a 
blackmun wrote for the court 
he said such price regulation may not be accomplished piecemeal 
through the extraterritorial reach of individual state statutes 
todays decision upheld a federal appeals court ruling that had 
invalidated the connecticut law 
the justice in 1983 had split 53 in striking down as 
unconstitutional a similar connecticut law 
the earlier version prohibited brewers from selling brands of 
beer in the state at a price higher than the lowest price which 
those beers sold for in new york massachusetts and rhode island 
under that law the controlling price was changed each month 
the retail price of beer generally has been higher in connecticut 
than in its neighboring states and many connecticut consumers buy 
beer in one of the three other states 
the earlier law was struck down because it was deemed to affect 
the price of beer outside connecticut by locking beer prices in all 
four states for onemonth periods to the level posted in connecticut 
the 1984 connecticut law ruled on today however stated that the 
posted connecticut beer prices had only to reflect the lowest prices 
being offered at the time of the posting 
the law in theory did not prevent brewers from lowering prices 
in the three neighboring states at any time during the calendar 
month covered by such posting 
blackmun said the 1984 impermissibly requires outofstate 
brewers to take account of their connecticut prices when setting 
prices in the three other states 
for example he said the connecticut law deprives outofstate 
brewers of the advantage of making promotional and volume discounts 
in the three neighboring states 
because volume discounts are permitted in massachusetts new 
york and rhode island but not in connecticut the effect of 
connecticuts affirmation scheme is to deter volume discounts in 
each of these other states because the lowest of the 
volumediscounted prices would have to be offered as the regular 
price for an entire month in connecticut blackmun said 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices john paul stevens 
and sandra day oconnor dissented 
the case is healy vs beer institute 88449

an american university similar to those in beirut 
and cairo could open in the soviet union as early as next year 
organizers of the first usrun summer school lecture course in 
moscow said today 
sen robert kasten said the lecture seminar by politicians 
journalists economists and artists is the first step toward 
establishing such a us institution in moscow 
we see this as the beginning of an american university in 
moscow the wisconsin republican said before addressing a group of 
100 soviet intellectuals at the seminar sponsored by the soviet 
academy of sciences the washingtonbased independent university and 
the american foreign policy council 
other lecturers at the seminar included sen phillip gramm 
rtexas norman podhoretz editor of commentary magazine and frank 
shakespeare the us ambassador to the vatican 
kasten said the possibility of establishing a moscowbased 
university where soviets and foreigners could study is a result of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policies of political restructuring 
and openness 
all soviet instititions of higher learning now are run by the 
government 
kasten said he hoped the proposed new university would be similar 
to the american universities in the capitals of lebanon and egypt 
those universities are fouryear institutions offering college 
degrees 
edward lozansky a soviet emigre and director of the independent 
university said if everything goes right we could begin 
offering regular courses by 1990 lozansky and other officials 
were not specific on what approval was needed to open a fulltime 
school 
the summerschool program which began on sunday and ends friday 
includes lectures discussions and panels in which americans and 
soviets compare their political and economic systems 
gramm spoke about capitalism freedom and opportunity in america 
and kasten discussed the separation of powers laid down by the us 
constitution my lecture is sort of like teaching civics 101 to 
the soviets he said 
lozansky said that if everything goes according to plan the 
soviet government will provide quarters for the university and 
funding will come from independent groups in the united states 
the university in beirut has been closed since the latest 
outbreak in lebanons 14yearold civil war began in march

republican national chairman lee atwater 
told the nations mayors today his party is not opposed to 
spending more money on the cities and will actively recruit blacks 
as mayoral candidates 
atwater said republicans hope to establish a political 
beachhead in the cities by winning the new york mayoral race this 
year 
atwater at the annual meeting of the us conference of mayors 
steered clear of the bush administrations differences with 
republican and democratic mayors on guns and taxes but said the 
president would be responsive to cities 
george bush does have the cities in mind atwater said 
we in the republican party are not opposed to spending more money 
on the cities we just want to be careful to spend taxpayers money 
on projects that work 
more than 200 mayors heard atwater at the conference which bush 
declined to attend atwater offered no specifics on urban aid which 
the mayors want increased 
later speaking to reporters he dismissed disagreements the 
administration has with the mayors on resolutions nearing final 
approval by the group republican and democratic mayors have backed 
policy statements calling for an increase in federal taxes and an 
outright ban on semiautomatic weapons 
theres going to be all kinds of things the mayors and the 
president disagree on atwater said the fact is theres a very 
good spirit down here toward the president 
speaking to the largely democratic group of mayors atwater 
pointed to his support for efforts to recruit black voters to the 
gop he said it would seek black candidates for mayoral races too 
and support them financially 
atwater singled out for introduction one black republican mayor 
james a garner of hempstead ny but mistakenly first said 
garner was from schenectady ny 
a resolution calling for legislation far beyond president bushs 
more limited steps against semiautomatics won unanimous approval 
sunday from a resolutions committee of the us conference of mayors 
it appeared headed for approval from the full group of more than 
200 mayors before their conference concludes wednesday 
it helps the congress to have the backing they need to go 
forward and to realize there are more people out there in the 
cities than are in the nra said mayor barbara fass of stockton 
calif who sponsored the call for a ban on possession of the 
weapons 
her reference was to the national rifle association which has 
been the leading opponent of gun control measures across the 
country including actions to stem the spread of the assaulttype 
weapons those guns are often converted to fully automatic weapons 
and are increasingly used by drug dealers in the nations cities 
where drugrelated crime has soared 
fasss city of stockton was the site of a recent bloody attack in 
which a deranged man fired an ak47 assault weapon on young children 
in a school yard killing five and injuring 31 the attack 
galvanized opinion against the weapons and prompted californias 
legislature to pass tough limits on semiautomatics 
bush has banned imports of assault weapons the mayors 
resolution would ban domestic manufacture as well as possession 
the mayors considered dozens of resolutions on a wide range of 
topics and were poised to give final approval to a strong new 
policy statement advocating higher federal taxes 
this afternoon they were to hear from jack kemp secretary of 
the scandalplagued department of housing and urban development 
republican mayors were firmly in support of the call for a tax 
increase despite bushs read my lips promise to oppose tax 
increases 
the gop mayors proposal adopted in committee without dissent 
calls on congress and the administration to raise revenues in a 
fair equitable and progressive way it says the money raised 
should go to reduce the federal budget deficit and to finance new 
urban aid 
a realistic evaluation of the deficit problem confirms that no 
effective deficit reduction approach can be implemented without a 
significant infusion of revenues into the federal treasury the 
statement says 
oddly it was some of the more liberal democratic mayors who 
opposed on tactical grounds the call for higher taxes arguing that 
the statement might not be well received in congress while 
republicans advocated it in the committees 
it makes no sense from a political standpoint to go in there 
and say we need to raise taxes mayor john o norquist of 
milwaukee told his colleagues in earlier committee meetings 
but kansas city mo mayor richard berkley a republican and 
past president of the mayors conference responded by noting that 
the mayors were asking for money for urban programs and added the 
first thing anybody is going to ask you is how are you going to pay 
for it 
among the other resolutions was one deploring recent supreme 
court decisions that civil rights advocates say have weakened 
affirmative programs aimed at ending discrimination in employment 
it asks congress for legislation protecting affirmative action 
programs 
the problem with these decisions is its just opening the 
floodgates for negative lawsuits trying to undo just literally 
hundreds and thousands of plans all around the country that have 
basically been working pretty well said mayor bill hudnut of 
indianapolis a republican and head of the mayors civil rights 
subcommittee 
the ban on assault weapons was part of a broad resolution calling 
for tougher drug penalties and asking the president to use debt 
reduction as an incentive for drugproducing countries to stem the 
flow of drugs it also asks that closed and underused military 
bases be converted to prisons and drug treatment centers

the supreme court ruled unanimously today that 
federal courts have authority to referee some disputes over electric 
power rates between public utilities and local or state regulatory 
agencies 
the justices ordered a federal court to review a claim by new 
orleans public service inc nopsi a utility seeking to pass on 
135 million in costs to its customers 
justice antonin scalia in his opinion for the high court 
compared the utilitys claim to a challenge to an allegedly 
unconstitutional state law or local zoning ordinance 
we would assuredly not require such suits to be brought in 
state courts he said moreover he said there is no doctrine 
that the availability or even the pendency of state judicial 
proceedings excludes the federal courts from ruling in such cases 
the justices in a related ruling last year severely limited the 
authority of states to lower electric rates public utilities charge 
as a result of agreements with federal regulators 
but that decision left unanswered whether federal judges should 
rule in such disputes or should leave these matters to state courts 
the court said today that federal judges should not abstain 
todays case involves a nearly decadeold dispute between nopsi 
and the new orleans city council which under louisiana law sets 
utility rates charged consumers in new orleans 
the council barred the utility from charging customers for the 
costs the utility incurred by buying electric power generated by the 
36 billion grand gulf 1 nuclear power plant in port gibson miss 
the rates charged the new orleans utility to purchase power from 
grand gulf were set by the federal energy regulatory commission 
therefore the utility argued city and state officials are 
powerless to prevent it from passing on the costs to its customers 
the federal energy regulatory commission in 1985 ordered the new 
orleans utility to pay 17 percent of the cost of constructing grand 
gulf 1 
nopsi in a partial settlement with the city council in 1986 
agreed to absorb 512 million of the costs of grand gulf 
the utility said the city had assured it would be allowed to 
recover the remaining 135 million share of its costss through 
higher retail rates over a period of time 
but the council said the utility acted imprudently in failing to 
resell the power it agreed to purchase from grand gulf and the 
council blocked a passthrough to the customers 
the utility sued in federal court for permission to pass on the 
135 million to its customers arguing that the federal commissions 
role in the matter preempted the city councils power 
a federal judge denied the utilitys claims and the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling 
the case is new orleans public service vs new orleans city 
council 88348

a high school sophomore dissatisfied with 
his education in this rural community vented his gripe in a student 
newspaper ad that read id dun learned a heks of aloot ast 
lecanto 
jimmy porter placed a 17line advertisement complete with 
misspellings and improper grammar in the yearend issue of lecanto 
high schools panther prowl 
the best education you get if you play a sport 4 out of 5 
doctors said they would rather be stranded on a desert than go to 
lecanto high school maybe someone will realize that this is not 
the real world wrote jimmy who was newspapers advertising 
manager 
principal mike fox whose 950student high school ranks in the 
top 10 percent in florida was not happy 
it was not received with great kindness he said adding 
you have to remember this is a 15yearold kid its kind of an 
immature thing to do 
he and other administrators defended the school 
its 220 graduates this year won 250000 in scholarships and 
students generally scored higher than the national average on 
achievement tests said neal weiss executive director of 
administrative services 
fox said he doesnt expect everyone to like the school but added 
jimmy could have found another way to resolve his problem 
the staff and the kids felt it was real inappropriate he 
said before refusing to discuss the matter further 
with school ending earlier this month the ad was a parting shot 
for jimmy he is moving with his family to sante fe nm from this 
crossroads community of 2500 people and one stop light about 120 
miles north of tampa 
ha ha im going to a real school and you all have to stay 
hear read the bottom line of the ad he then signed his name 
jimmy just had an ax to grind and off he goes said his 
mother nancy we told him this isnt what you do you dont 
bring about change this way this is dumb 
we dont condone it said mrs porter a volunteer in the 
citrus county parentteacher association who headed the pta council 
for more than six years and served on school advisory and study 
committees 
jimmys father earl served on a state committee concerned with 
schoolbusiness partnerships 
porter also formed a privately supported group that provides 
scholarships and sponsors science and math projects 
jimmy was not available for comment because he was on vacation 
out of state mrs porter said 
it beats me how it all happened it beats me how the kid 
survived it she said were planning to move he knew he was 
getting out after it ran i said maybe we ought to leave tonight 
then jimmy beats a retreat to his summer hideaway 
mrs porter said nothing in particular provoked jimmy whom she 
described as a fair student passing with bs and cs 
jimmys biggest problem is hes not yet got his act together to 
determine grades are important hes bright and we keep enough 
pressure on him 
when the heats on hell produce 
jimmy went to journalism camp last summer and loved this 
newspaper stuff said his mother adding that she didnt know 
whether that experience prompted his deed 
he was gutsy ill give him that he signed his name to it 
mrs porter said 
she said she can understand her sons frustration after her 
active participation in the system 
i get frustrated kids arent challenged enough mrs porter 
said if you expect high things of them theyll rise to the 
occasion sometimes i dont think they try enough the kids pick up 
on this stuff

the supreme court today reinstated the life 
sentence of a convicted missouri murderer ruling that a lower court 
wrongly decided he should go free 
by a 54 vote the court said the constitutions doublejeopardy 
protections for criminal defendants did not require that larry p 
thomas life sentence be thrown out 
neither the doublejeopardy clause nor any other constitutional 
provision exists to provide unjustified windfalls justice anthony 
m kennedy wrote for the court 
thomas was convicted of murder and attempted robbery in the 
botched holdup of an automobile parts store in st louis on nov 8 
1972 
mentoe vernell a customer was killed in a shootout 
thomas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted robbery 
and to life for murder 
former gov christopher bond commuted the robbery sentence in 
1981 after thomas had served about eight years he remained in 
prison on the murder conviction 
a state court subsequently threw out the sentence for attempted 
robbery and credited the time thomas had served for that crime to 
the murder sentence 
but the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that 
the multiple sentences for the same crime violated thomas 
doublejeopardy protections since the governors commutation meant 
that thomas legally had served one of his sentences the other 
sentence had to be thrown out and thomas set free the appeals court 
said 
but the nations highest court disagreed today 
the missouri courts alteration of thomas sentence to a single 
term for felony murder with credit for time served provided suitable 
protection for his doublejeopardy rights kennedy wrote 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white harry a blackmun and sandra day oconnor 
justices antonin scalia william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens dissented 
writing for the four scalia said the court wrongly was making an 
exception from its previous doublejeopardy rulings to avoid what it 
perceives as an unjust result 
a technical rule with equitable exceptions is no rule at all 
scalia said three strikes out the state broke the rules here 
and must abide by the result 
the case is jones vs thomas 88420

the supreme court today gave railroads broader 
power to test their workers for drugs upholding routine tests for 
conrail employees 
by a 72 vote the justices said conrail the consolidated rail 
corporation may require the tests without permitting collective 
bargaining over the issue 
the decision marks the first time the court has ruled on drug 
testing by private employers but the ruling is based on an 
interpretation of the federal railway labor act and may not have 
sweeping impact for other workers 
last march in its first rulings on testing for drug and alcohol 
abuse in the american workplace the court said workers in sensitive 
government jobs or entrusted with public safety may be forced to 
undergo the tests 
in the conrail case the railroad announced in february 1987 that 
it unilaterally would check for drugs as part of a urinalysis 
administered periodically to workers and also when they returned to 
work after an absence 
the railway said the need for the tests was magnified by an 
accident at chase md on jan 4 1987 in which an amtrak 
passenger train collided with conrail locomotives killing 16 and 
injuring 174 the conrail engineer and brakeman subsequently were 
found to have been using marijuana 
conrail had conducted urine tests since 1976 as part of periodic 
physical examinations administered to workers at intervals varying 
between one and three years depending on the employees age and job 
classification 
but those tests were aimed at discovering whether a worker for 
example had diabetes and not whether the employee was using drugs 
railway labor unions said adding the drugscreening component to 
the urinalysis is a major labormanagement dispute as defined by 
the federal railway labor act and therefore must be submitted to 
collective bargainng 
justice harry a blackmun writing today for the court said the 
dispute is a minor one because it is not based on frivolous or 
obviously insubstantial claims by the employer 
conrail has argued that it needs for medical purposes to 
require employees who deny that they are drugdependent to 
demonstrate that they are capable of producing a drugfree urine 
sample at will blackmun said that need is not frivolous 
also blackmun said conrails wellestablished recognition of 
the relevance of drug use to medical fitness substantially weakens 
the unions claim that conrail now for the first time is engaging 
in medical testing that reveals facts about employees private 
offduty conduct 
the ruling overturned a decision by the 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals which said conrail may not conduct the tests without 
evidence that particular workers may be using drugs 
the railroad said drug and alcohol abuse is a major problem in 
the transportation industry it said there are studies estimating 
that 25 percent of railroad workers drink on duty and showing that 
alcohol and other drugs were responsible for 37 deaths 80 injuries 
and 34 million in property damage between 1975 and 1985 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion today said 
the workers have the right to go to the bargaining table before 
their employer adopts testing that could result in their firing 
the railroad unions have not agreed to the systematic 
suspicionless testing on such terms and in such manner as the 
employer alone prescribed of all employees for evidence of criminal 
activity that could result in discharge brennan said he was 
joined in dissent by justice thurgood marshall 
in other action the court 
turned down an appeal by a california woman facing criminal 
charges in her daughters death because she tried to heal the child 
through prayer rather than seeking medical help 
the justices without comment refused to block the womans trial 
in sacramento on charges of childendangerment and involuntary 
manslaughter 
struck down a connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer sold 
in the state costs no more than it does in three neighboring states 
by a 63 vote the court said such laws unconstitutionally 
interfere with interstate commerce 
ruled unanimously that federal courts have authority to referee 
some disputes over electric power rates between public utilities and 
local or state regulatory agencies 
the justices ordered a federal court to review a claim by new 
orleans public service inc nopsi a utility seeking to pass on 
135 million in costs to its dustomers 
turned down an appeal by margaret randall a professor and 
writer threatened with deportation from the united states for 
supporting communism 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that it is 
premature to consider the constitutional and legal issues she raised 
barred asbestos manufacturers from suing the government to 
recover money they paid to a navy shipyard worker injured by 
inhaling the product 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by two 
manufacturers in a case from washington state 
refused to reinstate former maryland gov marvin mandels 1977 
mailfraud conviction thrown out five years after he completed a 
prison term 
the court without comment rejected a bush administration appeal 
aimed at using mandels case to set guidelines on when someone may 
challenge a fraud conviction for which the sentence already was 
served 
the drugtesting case is conrail vs railway labor executives

schools have banned the peace symbol made 
famous by antiwar protesters and flower children saying the sign 
is used by devil worshipers 
its harder for those of us who lived in the 60s to be told 
that the peace symbol means something completely different said 
kirk lewis spokesman for the pasadena independent school district 
in this houston suburb 
but experts are telling us that and it became inappropriate 
for children to wear them 
the peace symbol is prohibited in at least six pasadena schools 
and a districtwide ban may be established in the fall he said 
a few miles away baytown schools also ban the symbol 
pasadena officials said the recent drug and cultrelated 
slayings of 15 people in matamoros mexico reinforced their doubts 
about the symbol 
the dramatic conclusion of that tragedy made us sit up and take 
notice but the awareness was already there lewis said wed 
pick up little signs like students doodling things on desk tops 
while not listening in class or rumors of some students involved in 
cult practices 
student andrew yuhr 12 said his tshirt with the symbol just 
meant peace 
if they ban peace symbols theyll have to ban basic geometry 
because of all its lines and circles he said 
the peace symbol a circle with an inverted y with an 
extended bar is believed to date from the late 1950s created by 
nuclear disarmament advocates from the semaphore codes for n and 
d 
lyle j rapecki an occult expert in flagstaff ariz and author 
of a book on satanic symbols said that to some groups the peace 
symbol represents neros cross which he described as an upsidedown 
cross with broken arms 
debora johnson said she was shocked when her 11yearold told her 
about the peacesymbol ban at school 
a lot of my hippie friends wore peace symbols when my son told 
me some people are saying it has an evil meaning i said thats 
not what that means i was shocked she said from peace symbol 
to devil sign theres a big gap there

the supreme court in a victory for civil 
rights lawyers and their clients today upheld the award of more 
than 4 million in legal fees to lawyers who won a kansas city mo 
school desegregation suit 
the justices voting 80 ruled that paralegals law clerks and 
recent law school graduates are entitled to compensation at the 
market rate for their work 
by a separate 53 vote the court said states that lose such 
cases may be forced to pay extra money to civil rights attorneys as 
compensation for a delay in payment 
state and city officials were held responsible for segregation in 
the kansas city school system and were ordered in 1985 to spend 
877 million to improve and integrate the schools 
a federal judge then ordered the state to pay more than 17 
million to arthur a benson ii of kansas city the lead attorney for 
students who sued and 23 million to the naacp legal defense fund 
for its work 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the attorneys fees 
last year under a federal civil rights law that awards them to 
lawyers who win such cases 
missouri officials argued the legal fees were inflated illegally 
to compensate benson and the others for waiting years to be paid 
justice william j brennan in his opinion today said the 
additional compensation is not barred by a constitutional provision 
that protects states against some lawsuits 
he was joined in that part of his opinion by justices byron r 
white harry a blackmun john paul stevens and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting on that issue were chief justice william h rehnquist 
and justices sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia

most americans favor greater spending on 
education and power for parents to choose public schools and a 
sizable minority backs a move to yearround classes a national poll 
has found 
school competition through programs allowing parents to choose 
which schools their children attend is a cornerstone of president 
bushs education policy bush has questioned the need for more 
spending 
the media generalassociated press poll conducted as the 
traditional school year approached its close found concern about 
education on a variety of fronts and enthusiasm for several 
educational initiatives 
after a decade in which the backtobasics movement swept the 
schools respondents feared that pupils are absorbing facts without 
learning to think most doubted the validity of standardized tests 
as a gauge of true learning 
despite the concerns 53 percent of the 1084 adults polled rated 
their communitys public schools as good or excellent overall those 
with children in the schools rated them even more highly with 61 
percent favorable 
among the findings 
twothirds favored more spending on public schools and nine in 
10 of that group said they would accept higher taxes to pay for it 
even adults without children in school backed greater spending by 
nearly 2to1 
fiftyeight percent said parents should be able to choose which 
public schools their children attend proponents say that creates 
competition that forces schools to improve critics say it drains 
resources from the schools that need the most improvement 
more than four in 10 favored yearround classes with vacations 
scattered through the year rather than concentrated in a long summer 
break critics question the expense of keeping schools open and 
paying teachers yearround while supporters say the continuity 
enhances learning 
fiftytwo percent said their local schools do an adequate job 
teaching children basic facts and skills but only 39 percent 
expressed satisfaction with the way the schools teach pupils how to 
think and reason 
fiftyfour percent said they believe standardized tests do not 
reflect how well pupils are learning in school such tests have been 
used to monitor learning for decades critics argue that they 
encourage rote learning 
parents with children in public schools consistently rated the 
schools more highly than did other respondents bigcity dwellers 
were more likely than others to rate their schools poorly 
the poll found sentiment for a shift in school financing schemes 
among those who favored more spending only onesixth wanted it to 
come primarily from local governments which usually fund schools 
with property taxes three in 10 wanted more federal money and four 
in 10 favored greater state support the rest had no preference 
support for higher spending declined sharply with age nearly 
eight in 10 of the youngest respondents age 1829 supported more 
spending that fell to 48 percent of the oldest those over 64 
similarly more than threequarters the youngest group said 
raising teachers salaries would attract betterqualified people to 
the profession less than half of the oldest group agreed 
such differences extended to other issues older respondents were 
less likely to rate school performance favorably and were less 
willing to reject standardized tests 
younger respondents stood out in their opposition to yearround 
classes twothirds were opposed while opinion was more evenly 
divided among those age 30 and up overall among those with an 
opinion on yearround school 49 percent were opposed and 44 percent 
were in favor a split decision given the polls threepoint margin 
of error 
finally about half the respondents thought bush who wants to be 
known as the education president will be able to improve public 
education among those willing to prognosticate 46 percent expected 
that he will succeed and 37 percent said he will not

president bush has full confidence that 
secretary jack kemp will clean up alleged widespread mismanagement 
and influencepeddling at the department of housing and urban 
development a white house spokesman said today 
deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said bush had talked with 
kemp on saturday about allegations of multimilliondollar fraud at 
hud during the reagan administration 
hes confident the secretary can turn around the management 
situation there popadiuk told reporters the secretary is 
tackling the situation 
for his part kemp vowed in a television interview sunday to root 
out politics and influencepeddling at the agency he has headed 
since earlier this year 
denying that the burgeoning hud scandal was symptomatic of a 
laissezfaire attitude during the reagan years kemp said that 
anytime the government subsidizes major industries problems are 
bound to occur 
but he said that under his leadership hud had reinstituted 
competitive bidding procedures and removed the bias the 
prejudice the politics from its grant programs 
popadiuk said secretary kemp said he is determined to clean up 
the department in every way and would not tolerate any abuse of the 
public trust the president is confident the secretary is going 
to turn the management around and get control of the situation at 
hud 
im told the president wants to get to the bottom of this he 
added 
asked when bush expected kemp to complete his job of restoring 
good management practices popadiuk said im not going to put a 
timetable on that but as soon as possible the better 
kemp appearing on the cbstv show face the nation was 
asked whether thenpresident reagans pledge to get the government 
off the peoples backs could be blamed for the subsequent scandals 
that hit the savings and loan and defense industries and now hud 
i dont think laissezfaire is quite the right word for it 
kemp said the system was flawed to the extent that when you get 
in the business of having the government subsidize big developers or 
big defense contractors or any person without a competitive 
process based upon merit and need and quality then youre going to 
get into the problems that we have rooted out and are trying to root 
out at hud 
but i can assure you that the political influence of contracts 
going to people with political friends has been going on for quite 
some time he added im not trying to shift the blame to 
democrats or republicans but i want to public to know that this 
secretary under this president is going to remove the politics and 
the influencepeddling from the agency over which i have been asked 
to exert leadership 
on an appearance saturday on cnns evans and novak show kemp 
said i think it is very clear there have been some who have been 
criminal 
that contradicted earlier statements by huds inspector general 
paul adams that his staff had not found evidence of criminality 
during its audit of hud accounting procedures and contract awards 
programs during the tenure of former hud secretary samuel pierce 
kemp acknowledged that his former presidential campaign manager 
charles black later went to work to get hud contracts for clients 
but he said there was no quid pro quo that black in return for 
campaign work would be able to cash in later with government 
lobbying activities 
kemp has released an internal audit by adams that said millions 
of dollars in hud subsidies were distributed for renovation of 
lowincoming housing without regard to need or fairness and that 
much of the money was steered to private developers who formerly had 
been hud officials or had ties to prominent republicans 
adams found developers had paid millions in consulting fees to 
former hud officials or prominent republicans including former 
interior secretary james watt who received 400000 
also under investigation are huds program of using outside 
contractors known as closing agents to handle foreclosure sales of 
government property agents are believed to have made off with 
millions of dollars they were supposed to turn over to the 
government 
attorney general dick thornburgh on thursday ordered a federal 
investigation of all hud offices for fraud and embezzlement 
kemp said sunday the attorney general is going to have to make 
decisions as to criminality pierces involvement he said will 
be looked at politically it will be looked through the inspector 
general

president bush opening a week of white house 
events focusing on youth today called for a day when every school 
in the nation will be safe and drug free 
at a rose garden ceremony bush honored schools for their efforts 
to rid their corridors and classrooms of drugs 
fortyseven schools from 24 states and the district of columbia 
were honored in the annual drugfree schools recognition program 
launched by drug policy coordinator william j bennett when he was 
secretary of education in the reagan administration 
as i look around here today i see some of the top commandos in 
the war on drugs our teachers community leaders parents and 
students the president said 
youre the ones winning this war because you are the ones 
looking to tomorrow youre the ones who know it takes a clear mind 
to get a good education and lead a productive life you understand 
that students have a right to learn in drugfree schols 
bush said that while most schools were now out for the summer 
theres one last lesson for all americans to learn he called 
for downright stubborness in the effort to see that every 
school in this country can win every school in this country can be 
safe and drug free 
the president noted that the red tie and ribbon he was wearing 
was intended to symbolize drugfree schools he said it was inspired 
by harold maready the principal of roosevelt vocational school in 
lake wales fla 
he bet his students that that if at least half the school 
wore red that is were drug free hed paint his bald head with 
the words just say no well 225 out of 295 showed up in red 
and guess what happened 
i think mr maready had a great idea and im looking for

the soviet parliament began confirmation hearings 
monday for the cabinet of premier nikolai i ryzhkov amid 
indications that some of the appointees would face tough 
questioning tass said 
in contrast to the initial work of the congress of peoples 
deputies and the parliament or supreme soviet which captivated 
audiences across the country for days the hearings were not 
televisied and were closed to foreign reporters 
among those going through the hearings were foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze defense minister dmitri t yazov and kgb 
chairman vladimir kryuchkov tass said 
after the questioning of ryzkhov by members of the parliament 
about economic policies each of his 13 deputies and more than 50 
ministers are now to go through the same parliamentary purgatory 
as well the official news agency said 
and all indications are that some of them will find the going 
pretty tough it said 
it cited the case of gennady bogomyakov ryzhkovs candidate for 
minister of the oil and gas industry who was accused in the 
government newspaper izvestia last week of ignoring the environment 
while he was communist party chief in the tyumen region of siberia 
the tyumen area is siberias main oil and gas region 
hearings will continue for at least a week tass said they are 
to be followed by a 40day session of the full 542member supreme 
soviet which will confirm the appointees and begin drafting 
legislation 
speaking to the supreme soviet on june 10 ryzhkov said the 
number of ministries would be slashed to streamline the government 
the congress of peoples deputies is a new 2250 member 
parliamentary body that elected mikhail s gorbachev to a new more 
powerful presidency and chose the supreme soviet in its initial 
session that lasted from may 25june 9 
soviets eagerly watched the daily live telecasts in which 
congress deputies challenged communist party authority questioned 
gorbachev and other top officials and openly criticized such 
previously untouchable organizations as the kgb 
the supreme soviet replaces a 1500member parliament of the same 
name that rarely challenged kremlin authority

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether union members who sue their union for allegedly denying fair 
representation are entitled to a jury trial if they also seek 
monetary compensation such as back pay 
lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fair 
representation generally are tried before judges without juries 
but ruling in a case from north carolina last year the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals said a jury trial can be demanded when 
monetary compensation is part of the relief sought 
other appeals courts have ruled differently 
the 4th circuit courts ruling was a victory for 27 truck drivers 
who sued local 391 of the teamsters union in 1983 
the suit stemmed from the drivers transfers from various 
locations to the mclean trucking cos terminal in winstonsalem 
nc 
after the transfers the 27 were laid off and recalled on several 
occasions 
the drivers contend that mclean breached a collectivebargaining 
agreement by manipulating recall procedures so it could give other 
drivers preference over them and that local 391 failed to fairly 
represent them in the resulting grievances 
the suit sought among other things compensatory damages for 
lost wages and benefits 
the case is local 391 vs terry 881719

a bomb ripped through living 
quarters at a british military barracks monday and west german 
officials said they suspect the irish republican army was 
responsible 
no one was injured in the early morning blast only six soldiers 
were sleeping in the barracks at the time the british military said 
a west german boilerman employed at the osnabrueck barracks 
surprised two suspects who fled and left four unexploded bombs 
behind said hansjuergen foerster a prosecutors office spokesman 
the bombing came five days after west german officials indicted 
two suspected ira members for attacks on british military bases in 
west germany 
foerster said no one had claimed responsibility for mondays 
attack but added the target of the attack and the method used 
substantiate suspicions that the perpetrators are from the 
provisional irish republican army 
foerster said investigators discovered the five bombs contained 
176 pounds of the czechoslovak plastic explosive semtex 
the four unexploded bombs were not set to detonate presumably 
because the perpetrators were disturbed by an employee foerster 
said in an interview 
british forces spokesman nigel ginnis said the 62yearold 
boilerman was going about his business and discovered two men 
outside the building 
a shot was fired and he was hit in the face with a gun belt 
or something of that nature 
the boilerman was treated for scratches and bruises at a local 
hospital and released 
ginnis said an alarm was raised after a soldier in the building 
was awakened by the shot and went outside to investigate 
col henry day of british forces headquarters in west germany 
said the bomb exploded at 110 am at quebec barracks 100 miles 
north of duesseldorf 
it is headquarters for about 800 troops from the 12th armoured 
brigade and 23rd engineer regiment of the royal corps of engineers 
officials said 
a british military spokesman in osnabrueck who declined to be 
identified by name said the explosion caused severe damage 
it blew a hole from ground level to the roof of the building 
measuring about eight feet in diameter he said 
about 1000 people living nearby were evacuated temporarily while 
investigators searched for more bombs osnabrueck police said

british out of northern ireland and unite the predominantly 
protestant province with mostly roman catholic ireland 
on june 14 west german prosecutors said they indicted two 
suspected ira members on attempted murder charges in 1987 and 1988

tours of the historic district are a main 
attraction in this elegant port city where the civil war began but 
the hot ticket this week has been a tour of its poorest 
neighborhoods 
mayor joseph p riley jr displayed for his counterparts from 
around the country how charleston not only preserved and revitalized 
its downtown but extended the same emphasis on preservation and 
thoughtful urban design into such oftendreary needs as parking and 
public housing 
in the 60s the question was are the cities going to die 
said riley we found out that they arent 
the question now is what kinds of quality are our cities 
going to represent what we have to be very careful about is 
realizing we are building our countrys civilization in the cities 
and we have to do that with quality 
riley host of the annual meeting this week of the us 
conference of mayors is known among mayors for his success at urban 
redevelopment and for obtaining the federal grants that made it 
possible 
he showed off that success sunday when he led three busloads of 
mayors and other urban leaders on a tour of his city of 80000 
the citys poor east side is still blighted by dilapidated 
buildings and riley says charleston needs more public housing but 
the housing the city has built for its poor is attractive and is 
scattered throughout neighborhoods 
lowincome housing was built not in big projects or bleak boxes 
but in renovated homes that date to the 1880s and in reproductions 
of them each is in the unique style native to the city 
oneroomwide homes fit onto narrow lots with porches along the side 
we believe so strongly in charleston that nothing has to be 
ugly and certainly nothing the city builds should be ugly said 
riley 46 mayor since 1975 
the emphasis has been on preserving individual buildings and the 
feel of neighborhoods the cost he insisted was no more to 
renovate old homes than it would have been to tear down and build 
anew 
usually when you demolish something it is a sign of failure 
riley said our goal is to take every old dilapidated structure in 
the city and turn it into housing for our lowincome citizens 
in downtown charleston king street was dying a decade ago he 
said now its thriving from its old storefronts to the new 78 
million charleston place complex of hotel shops and convention 
center where the mayors are meeting 
the complex was completed three years ago assisted by 14 
million in urban development action grants and other federal aid 
the hotel was scaled back from original highrise plans and 
designed with curving bricks and balconies that blend smoothly with 
the citys old homes and buildings 
riley also showcased downtown parking garages that have been 
given tasteful disguises retail shops on the first floor and 
louvers on the upper levels 
he also took the mayors through the muck of a waterfront park 
still under construction it affords a view of fort sumter where 
the first shots of the civil war were fired and will become a major 
attraction in an area that has been abandoned and unattractive for a 
century 
no detail is too small to escape the citys beautification the 
city spent 5000 to convert one traffic island from pavement to a 
minipark with grass and palmetto trees 
on a bigger scale the abandoned city incinerator was turned into 
a community center giant smokestacks still standing out front 
parks in poor neighborhoods were reclaimed with chainlink 
fencing replaced by landscaping touches 
quality design and construction was their right as well 
riley said of the residents of poor neighborhoods 
but while riley was showing mayors how redevelopment can succeed 
he also made the point that it would be difficult for other cities 
to repeat the udag program that has pumped 25 million into the 
city to attract private investment is ending and federal aid for 
housing and other programs is dwindling

the government is increasingly portraying soldiers 
who helped crush the prodemocracy movement as heroes and martyrs 
focusing heavily on grisly descriptions and grieving families 
chinas hardline leadership has been using statecontrolled 
media to encourage sympathy for the military by focusing on gruesome 
instances in which soldiers were slain or wounded 
li guorui was thrown off this bridge early on the morning of 
june 4 a peoples armed police officer said monday at beijings 
fuchengmen intersection 
wreaths of multicolored paper chrysanthemums lined the bridge in 
memory of the 20yearold from inner mongolia a photo of li was 
draped in black ribbons and offerings of fruit and drinks were laid 
before it 
at fuchengmen and elsewhere displays of wreaths show where 
soldiers fell 
banners pay tribute to them offering sympathy and praise from 
schoolchildren workers the communist party and fellow soldiers 
li broke his right leg cracked his skull and bled to death 
the police officer told an american journalist before another 
officer told the reporter he had to stop interviewing and taking 
photographs because it violated martial law orders 
the chinese media have given much attention to li 25yearold 
liu guogeng and cui guozheng the three were killed during the june 
34 offensive by the peoples liberation army against prodemocracy 
protesters in beijings tiananmen square 
liu was beaten and burned on changan avenue as the army shot its 
way toward tiananmen in the predawn hours of june 4 and cui was 
thrown off a pedestrian bridge at the chongwenmen intersection and 
set on fire 
western intelligence estimates and chinese sources say up to 
3000 people were killed during the march on tiananmen the 
government says fewer than 300 died about half of them soldiers 
for the last several days the media has shown wounded soldiers 
citizens thanking troops and eulogies for the three martyrs 
premier li peng who imposed martial law may 20 and qiao shi 
who is apparently being eased into the post of communist party 
chief were shown on evening television news meeting the grieving 
families of the three dead men on monday 
we are deeply pained by their glorious sacrifice i thank you 
fathers and mothers for raising such fine soldiers li told 
relatives their deaths have also awakened thousands upon 
thousands of people in seeing through the brutal nature of the 
rebels 
a day earlier president yang shangkun a former general who 
chinese sources say ordered the raid on tiananmen met with the 
families 
they are the glory of your families the glory of the army and 
the glory of the nation yang said in the peoples liberation army 
daily 
a few hundred yards west of tiananmen on changan avenue a few 
dozen wreaths surround a photo of liu a second lieutenant 
a large poster describes how he joined the army in shandong in 
1983 was made platoon leader in 1987 applied for communist party 
membership and was preparing to get married 
on june 4 during the struggle to calm the 
counterrevolutionary turmoil he made a heroic sacrifice the 
poster reads 
going to the aid of comrades surrounded by crowds he was 
beaten with steel poles and bricks it says hoodlums beat him 
as he lay in a pool of his own blood and poured gasoline on him and 
set him on fire covered in flames and blood liu guogeng tried to 
stand up but they beat him again they cruelly hung his body on the 
remains of a burnedout bus 
cuis story is just as gruesome beaten by hooligans he was 
thrown off the pedestrian bridge doused with gasoline as he lay 
groaning and set on fire his body was strung up by the neck 
officials have conceded in recent days that there were some 
civilian casualties that were accidental but there are no public 
memorials to students or bystanders slain in the violence which 
witnesses and doctors say include the elderly and young children 
there are signs the relentless propaganda campaign is working 
a group of third graders from an elementary school near lis 
memorial came by to give popsicles to soldiers and peoples armed 
police we just came for the fun of it said one 
people are beginning to understand the army said a 
shopkeeper a few steps away from the flowers 
its like the chinese saying the army and the people are like 
fish and water she said they are one

stability roh told the meeting 
to recover lost competitiveness on exports officials said the 
government would stabilize the wons exchange rate against foreign 
currencies there would be no more appreciation of the won against

dollar last year and has gained 25 percent so far this year the 
united states has been seeking a strong won to offset its 9 billion

to 68 billion while the annual import target was revised to 64 
billion down from the original 65 billion

deficit of 11 million in sharp contrast to a surplus of 33 
billion during the same period in 1988 
roh and economic officials stressed the need to end a recent 
round of raises demanded by workers the economy has been hit during 
the past two years by strikes and demands for large raises

two feuding black factions 
called for peace monday after a bloody weekend left at least 26 
blacks dead 
there must be an end to the this senseless violence tearing our 
communities apart said the united democratic front south 
africas largest antiapartheid coalition and inkatha a political 
organization of the zulu people 
the two sides met for five hours monday in the latest round of 
periodic talks since the conflict erupted in 1986 previous meetings 
have not halted blackonblack violence that has killed more than 
1500 people in the southeastern cities of durban and 
pietermaritzburg 
both organizations claim more than 1 million members and concede 
they have little control over young supporters 
the groups said they will try to expose and isolate all those 
elements that we believe are actually engaged in this campaign of 
promoting violence amongst our people 
the statement did not elaborate but is considered a reference to 
white authorities and police who have made only a handful of arrests 
despite the hundreds of killings 
our efforts must be directed toward uniting our people in a way 
which could decisively strike a blow against apartheid and not our 
people the statement said of south africas legal policy of race 
discrimination 
police in kwazulu homeland said 26 blacks were killed over the 
weekend including five slain en route to a sunday prayer rally 
addressed by mangosuthu buthelezi leader of the zulus and head of 
inkatha 
black people are too busy squabbling amongst themselves 
buthelezi told the crowd of 5000 many carrying knobbed wooden 
fighting sticks 
homeland police gave no details of the killings but south 
african police reports indicated at least nine appeared politically 
motivated 
kwazulu police said they are investigating reports that unkown 
white men were seen in a township where some deaths occurred 
however police said they have no evidence any whites were involved 
directly in the attacks 
the united democratic front and inkatha both oppose apartheid 
but the front is much more militant favoring boycotts sanctions 
strikes and protests not endorsed by the relatively conservative 
zulu organization 
the front accuses police of favoring inkatha a charge the police 
deny 
almost all the fronts top leaders have been detained at various 
times and the organization is one of more than 30 antiapartheid 
groups officially banned last year although it still conducts some 
activities 
some antiapartheid activists accuse buthelezi of collaborating 
with the whiteled government by participating in the black homeland 
system buthelezi says he sees the homelands as an interim step to 
black majority rule 
south africas 28 million blacks have no voice in national 
affairs the 5 million whites maintain political and economic 
control and have segregated schools neighborhoods and hospitals

guyana president desmond hoyte emerged from the 
white house on monday with praise from president bush for the tough 
economic measures hoyte has instituted in his south american nation 
i tried to impress upon president bush our own earnestness in 
trying to put our economic house in order said hoyte who is 
visiting the united states to promote business investment in guyana 
despite a steep devaluation of the guyanese currency and cuts in 
price supports for such commodities as rice flour and gasoline 
hoytes government managed to embark on its austerity program in 
april without the riots that ensued when venezuela struck a similar 
course 
president bush expressed deep appreciation for our efforts 
hoyte said 
a white house official said bush expressed his admiration to 
hoyte for taking the tough steps he has done 
bush told him he appreciates how tough it is to implement such 
an austerity program said the official who insisted on 
anonymity bush also applauded the tough line hoyte has taken on 
combating narcotics 
hoyte speaking with reporters outside the white house said he 
thanked bush for us economic assistance and expressed the hope 
that this assistance will continue to be flexible 
on drugs hoyte said he has introduced pretty draconian 
legislation providing long jail sentences and the confiscation of 
property from drug traffickers 
we think that no individual country can tackle this mess of 
narcotrafficking it has to be a regional and international 
effort said hoyte 
hoyte said he was encouraged by improvements in the business 
outlook for his country including no less than 10 overseas mining 
corporations exploring for gold in guyana 
most significant of all has been the return of reynolds 
aluminum to guyana he said in 1975 we nationalized 
reynolds holdings in guyana i think it is a most eloquent 
testimony of the changed policies and the confidence that investors 
have in the climate at the moment that reynolds has returned 
reynolds has signed an agreement to open a bauxite mine that will 
produce 26 million tons of ore annually 
the signs are very encouraging said hoyte who was touring 
major cities across the midwest chicago indianapolis toledo 
ohio st louis and milwaukee to preach the gospel of investment 
in guyana 
i dont know what is going to arise really from these contacts 
but it makes good sense to make guyana known to as many business 
people and business communities as possible he said 
guyana has already signed agreements with its neighbors venezuela 
and brazil to cooperate on the interdiction of drug trafficking 
and generally to join forces in combating this evil he said 
an agreement will be signed later this year with suriname he 
added

more than two years after a judge ruled 
that mississippis method of electing judges violated the federal 
voting rights act eight blacks are on the ballot in elections 
tuesday that could more than double the number of blacks on the 
bench 
also on the ballot are three proposed constitutional amendments 
one would eliminate the racially motivated and longsince 
unenforced poll tax law 
judicial elections are being held this year because of a federal 
court order forcing judicial districts to be redrawn 
in april 1987 us district judge william h barbour jr of 
jackson ruled that the states judicial districts discriminated 
against blacks the ruling which was the first to apply a section 
of the 1965 federal voting rights act to judicial elections was 
upheld by the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minority 
subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to 
elect black candidates to judicial posts 
the ruling and the appeals process put judicial elections in the 
state on hold until this year when all 69 circuit and chancery 
judgeships are being filled 
party primaries were held in april and the winners of tuedsays 
races will take office july 3 
mississippi now has only four black judges among the 78 supreme 
court circuit court and chancery court judges in the state 
supreme court justice reuben anderson circuit judges fred l banks 
jr and lillie blackmonsanders and chancery judge isaac byrd 
each was appointed to fill a vacancy but anderson went on to win 
a full eightyear term in 1986 byrd did not seek election to a full 
term this year and the other two are seeking regular terms tuesday 
blackmonsanders is opposed by a republican banks and one other 
black democrat isadore w patrick are unopposed in the general 
election 
in other cicuit court and chancery court cases three black 
candidates are facing incumbents while two others are vying for 
open judgeships where neither candidate is an incumbent 
chancery courts handle civil lawsuits while circuit courts handle 
criminal cases 
one proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot would delete 
references to the levying of a poll tax as a requirement to register 
to vote it also would eliminate the fourmonth school year and a 
county common school fund which were to be financed from the poll 
tax collections 
the poll tax was aimed at keeping blacks off voter rolls it has 
remained on the books in the state even though it was struck down by 
the us supreme court in 1966 
another proposed constitutional amendment would remove the 
prohibition against outofstate businesses operating a railroad in 
mississippi all but unenforceable with the demise of local 
railroad companies the third would allow the legislature more 
flexibility in how it proposes future constitutional amendments

rosalyn taylor oneale was moving steadily toward 
middle age as a fasttrack career woman when her brother whispered 
to her something that gave her pause 
he told her she was adopted 
the news hit hard it got her thinking not only about the woman 
who gave her up but about herself oneale had given up a daughter 
for adoption when she was 19 
its very bizarre growing up thinking you are biological and 
everyone else even cousins know oneale 39 said in a 
telephone interview from her home in suburban acton 
so for two years since her brother divulged the news while 
their mother was undergoing heart surgery she has been conducting 
the unusual search for both her mother and her daughter 
its an odd feeling like im a single person in the world i 
want to be with people that look like me said oneale a human 
relations specialist at the digital corp headquarters in maynard 
mary byrne senior program director for boston childrens service 
association said that in her 35 years of working with adoptions she 
knows of only one other case like oneales 
born june 21 1950 in louisville ky oneale was adopted by 
the social worker handling the case when her mother gave her up at 
the age of 18 months she was distressed she had not been told about 
the adoption as a child but she is close to the family who raised 
her and theyre helping in her search 
oneale signed the adoption papers for her own daughter five days 
after giving birth sept 9 1969 to the girl she called katherine 
elaine 
she said she doesnt regret it i was too young but 
learning of her own adoption has heightened oneales concerns about 
her daughter often while speaking at colleges as a volunteer for 
the urban league she wonders if her daughter is in the audience 
she said 
its emotionally complex she said you are never 
disconnected from that child i want her to know that i knew i would 
have been a bad mother 
she said she feels a need to tell her mother she turned out 
fine and find out if her daughter received a good home 
oneale has made hundreds of phone calls written repeatedly to 
government agencies hired people to assist in her search and spent 
thousands of dollars in the process recently she ran a classified 
ad in usa today 
i am determined that before i grow older those women and i 
will get together and we will know each other immediately said 
oneale 
oneales adoptive mother who lives in kentucky has a different 
last name and asked that it not be used she said oneale was not 
told she was adopted because we wanted to prevent conflict between 
her and the natural son i always treated her like she came from my 
womb 
now she is helping in the search and the kentucky government 
agency that handles adoption records has sent along the name and 
background on her biological mother loraine ash the names of ashs 
parents and most important for oneale proof of a beginning 
before i felt like i dropped out of nowhere said oneale 
i ran around the house showing my footprint to my friends 
now she knows she shares with her biological mother an allergy to 
tomatoes and had tonsillitis in early childhood oneale said the 
records show her name at birth was roseline elaine her adoptive 
mother changed it to rosalyn katherine and oneale changed her name 
five years ago to rosalyn taylor oneale because she said it 
sounds distinguished 
she says her use of elaine as the middle name for her daughter 
when it was also her original middle name is coincidental 
armed with background on her mother oneale believes she will 
soon be successful in half of her search but she notes that 
apparently she got the names by mistake 
after yet another lead did not pan out recently oneale 
collapsed into tears and decided she would give up the search for a 
while 
but three days later the kentucky agency suddenly responded to 
one of her many letters by sending records someone in the agency 
apparently slipped unaware of the confidentiality rules 
its where the system breaks down and it helps adopted 
people she said its what i needed i feel reinspired now

a 76dayold strike against pittston coal 
group spread to kentucky today and a wildcat walkout by more than 
20000 miners in support of the pittston employees expanded to at 
least nine states 
terry varney spokesman for a united mine workers local said 
production stopped at three eastern coal corp mines in kentucky as 
of 1201 am eastern is a pittston subsidiary about 200 people 
work at the mines varney said 
the union had predicted the kentucky strike after 1600 pittston 
miners walked off the job in april in virginia and west virginia 
a sympathy strike begun on june 12 idled more 20000 umw members 
as of sunday in pennsylvania west virginia virginia tennessee 
indiana and kentucky this morning at least 2000 miners in ohio 
illinois and alabama joined the strike 
unlike the pittston walkout the sympathy strike has not received 
the public blessing of the umw but some union members said the 
walkout is being directed by umw president richard trumka he has 
been unavailable for comment for days 
in ohio workers at three southern ohio coal co mines employing 
1100 union miners didnt show up said terry trimper a company 
spokeswoman in illinois amax coal co said none of its 655 miners 
at its wabash mine showed 
in alabama drummond coal co said threefourths of its 1900 
union members on its late sunday shift did not show and jim walter 
resources inc said its underground operations in two counties were 
idle the number of strikers was not given 
there was no comment this morning from the united mine workers 
trumka and umw spokesman joe corcoran did not immediately return 
calls 
union officials in nova scotia and alabama have said miners there 
also were likely to strike and in indiana old ben coal co today 
asked a federal judge to order its 350 miners back to work the 
judge did not immediately rule 
as of sunday all of indianas 1750 union miners were off the 
job for the first time in eight years while in west virginia about 
twothirds of the states 24000 miners are on a sympathy strike at 
least 2500 wildcat strikers were idled in pennsylvania 790 in 
virginia 1270 in kentucky and 200 in tennessee 
the wildcat strikers say they are off the job to show support for 
the strike against pittston which last week declared negotiations 
at an impasse that move allows pittston to implement its latest 
contract offer 
at issue in the pittston strike are benefits and wages miners 
fear that pittstons demands if successful will be applied by 
other us companies 
a major rallying point for the strikers is the jailing of three 
umw leaders who helped organize the pittston walkout 
as the eastern coal strike began a picket line was set up at the 
gates of the companys main coal production facility at mcandrews 
about 20 miners milled about a freshly constructed picket shack 
a state police cruiser drove by and the troopers asked the 
miners how they were doing and if they had any hot coffee the 
policemen left wishing the miners good luck 
all miners wore camouflage and had yellow ribbons pinned to their 
shirts in a show of solidarity 
local 5737 president glenn stanley said he received a telegram 
and a phone call from trumka on sunday authorizing the local to 
strike 
according to stanley trumka said it was time to strike eastern 
because the company reportedly was ready to ship a large order of 
coal 
eastern did not immediately a call this morning

headlines about several unsolved murders in 
eastern virginia have faded but the victims families have not 
forgotten and theyre pressing law enforcement agencies to keep 
investigating 
you want to know and you dont want to know said richard 
call whose son keith disappeared on a date theres still a ray 
of hope very slight i guess 
on tuesday the families will press the state crime commission 
for a multijurisdictional police task force to investigate the 
crimes 
were hoping maybe somebody else out there wont end up like 
our family members said robert e fanton fatherinlaw of brian 
c pettinger whose bound body was found in the james river in 
february 1988 
its been nearly three years since cathleen thomas a young 
stockbroker and rebecca dowski a college student were found 
strangled with their throats cut in ms thomas car along the 
colonial parkway 
about two years ago david knobling 20 and robin edwards 14 
were found shot to death near the ragged island wildlife refuge 
where they had gone on a date 
in april 1888 christopher newport college students cassandra 
hailey and keith call disappeared on their first date the elder 
call found their abandoned car along the colonial parkway the next 
morning 
other cases the parents are concerned about include the january 
1988 slaying of dawn hill at an eastern shore service station the 
september 1988 shooting death of milton ames while he walked in 
exmore and the fatal stabbing of laurie ann powell who was found 
floating in the james river in april 1988 
the relatives do not think all the cases are connected but they 
do think the police should be doing more 
we had four jurisdictions that were involved they want to be 
the one that has the socalled glory of solving the case said 
kathy knobling david knoblings stepmother nobody wants to share 
the information 
mrs knobling and other relatives of 10 missing or murdered 
people formed family and friends against crime today to call 
attention to unsolved crimes she said the membership of the group 
and the number of victims represented fluctuates 
the fbi is investigating the thomasdowski murders and the 
callhailey disappearances because they occurred on federal park 
property 
we dont have information that those cases are related other 
than the fact that they both occurred in fairly close proximity 
said joe wolfinger special agent with the fbis norfolk office 
he said law enforcement agencies in the area already are 
cooperating but that he would not object to a task force if it would 
help solve the crimes 
we are meeting and discussing and have met with and discussed 
the facts to all these cases with the appropriate law enforcement 
offices he said 
the other slayings are being investigated by state and local 
police 
they are trying but theyve got robberies theyve got rapes 
theyve got other cases that have clues coming in mrs knobling 
said our cases get put on the back burner 
she said the families have obtained 23000 signatures on 
petitions seeking a regional police task force they are taking 
their cases to the crime commission because it advises the governor 
and state legislature on crime issues 
bob colvin the commissions executive director said he was 
unaware of the commission ever being asked to help set up a regional 
task force 
im not sure what we can do he said 
while the victims families wait for arrests they have become 
friends mrs knobling said they have cookouts and sometimes get 
together just to talk about their grief and their efforts to make 
sure the murders are not forgotten 
these murders are unsolved youve got a murderer or two or 
three walking around out there they could do it again she said 
if we can solve one murder we will feel like we will have 
accomplished what we set out to do

he wrote please do everything in your power to save from death 
the participants in the democratic movement in china by refusing to

historical mistake which can have tragic consequences for the 
developments in china the ussr and the whole world 
in west germany a spokesman for kohl said the chancellor has 
sent a letter to chinese premier li peng asking authorities to 
commute the death sentences of three dissidents in shanghai 
chief government spokesman hans klein said kohl had also asked 
chinese authorities to show clemency in other cases following the 
june 34 military crackdown 
china needs a policy of reconciliation and not a policy of 
retaliation klein quoted kohls letter as saying

president bush adopting a new approach in arms 
negotiations on monday proposed that the united states and soviet 
union agree upon and implement anticheating measures even before 
completing a treaty to cut longrange nuclear weapons 
such steps could involve trial inspections at each others 
missile sites and estabishment of technical groups to discuss 
equipment needed for verification measures 
bush announced his proposal as us and soviet negotiators met in 
geneva to resume strategic arms reduction talks start after a 
sevenmonth recess 
the talks aimed at reducing us and soviet longrange bombers 
landbased missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 
percent are the latest round in negotiations that began four years 
ago 
bush said the goal was creating a more stable nuclear balance 
and strengthening deterrence by reducing and constraining those 
strategic nuclear forces which pose the greatest threat to security 
and stability 
bush in a written statement said verification may be the most 
complex issue facing negotiators 
he said the united states was proposing that the two sides make 
a special effort to agree on and to begin implementing as soon as 
possible verification measures and socalled stability measures 
early agreement and implementation of them will speed 
resolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum to the 
efforts of our two countries to conclude expeditiously a start 
agreement bush said 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said bushs proposal 
probably would be presented to the soviets during the first plenary 
session of the geneva talks on wednesday 
typicially verification is one of the last issues for the 
negotiators after they have concluded how deeply they are going to 
cut weapons popadiuk said 
were going to put an added emphasis on verification up 
front he said 
the press spokesman insisted however we are not putting 
verification first we continue to work on verfication and other 
aspects of the start treaty simultaneously 
popadiuk said the emphasis on verification involves no 
preconditions or anything of that nature with regard to other 
aspects of the negotiations 
however it does represent a shift in tactics in that it 
envisions putting some verification measures in place before the two 
sides have reached agreement on an overall treaty 
bush said us negotiators were returning to the talks with my 
firm pledge that we will work vigorously to achieve fair and 
farreaching agreements that strengthen peace nothing has higher 
priority 
i am heartened by the growing evidence that the soviet union is 
prepared to negotiate seriously about agreements that promise to 
reduce the risk of war he said 
much has already been accomplished in the negotiations much 
remains to be done 
about 90 percent of the work was completed when the negotiations 
were suspended last november 
the unfinished 10 percent contains some of the thorniest issues 
such as weapons ceilings limits on air and sealaunched cruise 
missiles verification and how to deal with mobile missiles 
while not ruling out some adjustments from the reagan 
administration the white house says there will be a considerable 
degree of continuity in the us position

ussoviet talks to reduce longrange nuclear 
weapons resumed monday with president bush introducing a new 
emphasis on monitoring missile sites 
bush is suggesting the superpowers for the first time start 
verification or monitoring compliance before they finish 
negotiating a treaty 
a quick breakthrough appears unlikely in the talks begun under 
former president ronald reagan since both sides have indicated no 
changes of position on major outstanding issues 
moscow and washington sent new delegation leaders to geneva for 
the 11th round of talks since march 1985 on a strategic arms 
reductions treaty and defense and space issues 
richard burt a military expert and former us ambassador to 
west germany replaced veteran negotiator max kampelman after the 
sevenmonth pause yuri nazarkin chief soviet delegate to the 
40nation conference on disarmament succeeded alexei obukhov the 
talks will last six to seven weeks burt said 
in washington bush said verification may be the most complex 
issue facing negotiatorsbush proposed the two sides make a special 
effort to agree on and begin implementing as soon as possible 
verification measures 
he said this will speed resolution of outstanding issues 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the steps could include 
visits to each others missile sites 
burt received nazarkin for a onehour 20minute opening session 
at the us mission it was the second time they met 
afterward burt said he outlined president bushs overall 
approach to arms control emphasizing the presidents commitment to 
reducing the risk of nuclear war 
nazarkin spoke of a good start and also held out the prospect 
of unspecified soviet initiatives 
as the round progresses we will use our ideas and put them on 
the table he told reporters 
in detailed negotiations starting wednesday with a full meeting 
of both delegations burt will lead the us team and lem masterkov 
will continue as soviet negotiator under nazarkin 
delegates are expected first to review the many agreed points in 
the 400page draft pact 
talks were delayed by the bush administrations review of 
national security policy during the reagan presidency 
a new proposal bushs advisers are drafting calls for onsite 
test inspections in both countries to monitor cuts of longrange 
ballistic missiles already in the draft treaty according to us 
officials a pentagon official said bush wants to take advantage of 
the new soviet openness 
but neither side has hinted at movement in disputes over the 
pentagons spacebased star wars missile defense sealaunched 
cruise missiles and mobile landbased missiles 
the soviets say the us missile shield violates the 1972 
superpower antiballistic missile treaty 
disputes have developed over moscows demand for including 
seabased cruise missiles under the treaty and washingtons call for 
a ban on mobile missiles 
adm william j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
has predicted protracted and agonizing negotiations 
the superpowers have agreed to much of a draft treaty to cut 
longrange or strategic nuclear forces by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the treaty is intended to cover nuclear weapons with which the 
superpowers can strike each other including those considered most 
dangerous sea and landbased ballistic missiles and heavy bombers 
already agreed at earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of 6000 
nuclear warheads and 1600 delivery vehicles missiles and bombers 
for each side outlines of a system for monitoring compliance also 
were set

food experts met monday to seek ways of 
improving nutrition for millions of children in the arab world and 
boost food production to feed the regions rapidly swelling 
population 
the fourday symposium organized by the arab food industry 
federation and the united nations economic and social committee for 
western asia was opened by iraqi industry and military 
industrialization minister hussein kamel 
falah jaber head of the baghdadbased federation said the 
sumposium will try to draw a strategy to integrate arab food 
production and efforts to boost nutrition particularly for the 80 
million children under age 14 
it is of vital importance that arab children receive good 
quality food rich with nutrition if we want to increase our birth 
rate jaber said 
the arab world is in the grip of a baby boom the high birth rate 
and improved health care systems that have reduced infant mortality 
are rapidly swelling populations 
the arab world will have a population estimated at 650 million by 
the end of the century if current growth rates continue 
that is becoming a major problem in several countries because 
their economies cannot keep pace with the population growth 
the arab birth rate is one of the highest in the world according 
to the un childrens fund 182 million children were born in 1986 
in contrast to more than 4 million in the 12 countries of the 
european economic community 
the un body also forecast that the arab world will have an 
annual increase in population in 199095 of about 335 percent 
concern about the population growth rate in the arab world has 
stimulated debate about birth control in many arab countries 
but iraq is seeking to increase its birth rate to boost its 
population of around 16 million which is only onethird the size of 
neighboring iran its foe in an eightyear war 
baghdad is giving incentives for bigger families to try to double 
the population and meet what it considers the demographic challenge 
from iran 
the incentives include grants to newly married couples generous 
family allowance payments 12 months paid maternity leave for women 
followed by six months at halfsalary and preferential treatment for 
big families in the allocation of state housing 
jaber said the arab world lacked a strategy for its childrens 
food industry and needed to concentrate on better quality and higher 
standards in food products 
foreign experts will join the arab specialists to discuss ways of 
helping arab countries improve nutrition for their childern

school officials canceled the allnight 
graduation party they planned when they found drugs and alcohol 
during a search of buses in the middle of the night 
school superintendent timothy monahan said the disappointing turn 
of events does not mean the program will die 
i am certain that the class of 1990 will have celebration 
graduation if they desire he said monday but he said more 
parents must participate 
the amount of parents over the years has dwindled 
considerably he said we need your help and support if the 
program is to continue 
school and police officials held a news conference monday to sort 
out what led to the decision to call off the celebration and direct 
about 400 students to call their parents for a ride home at about 2 
am saturday 
police said that 40 to 50 of the 400 students were involved 
volunteer coordinators and school officials said they felt 
betrayed that students smuggled drugs and alcohol into the 
celebration and even smoked pot on a bus 
the more we found out about the situation the more betrayed we 
felt a disappointed project coordinator susan anderson said 
it was clear that these students set out to test the program and 
violate it 
after some chaperones smelled what they suspected was marijuana 
being smoked on a bus police searched all 11 buses and found 
marijuana cocaine beer and whiskey on three buses 
the buses were taking students from a pizza parlor to a bowling 
alley and movie theater no one was arrested though police said 
they were continuing interviews this week and might make arrests 
later 
after the discovery principal david matthews canceled the rest 
of the activities including a dawn breakfast and the awarding of 
prizes including a car and ordered all the students back to 
school where parents were called 
i think we made a very clear statement by terminating the 
program and we had to do that we had to be very uncompromising

commerce secretary robert mosbacher on monday 
defended the administrations gettough approach to opening foreign 
markets to american products saying that the effort must be made to 
correct huge trade imbalances 
in an address at the johns hopkins foreign policy institute 
mosbacher called last years us trade deficit of 120 billion 
unacceptable and said more has to be done to reduce the imbalance 
increasingly national economic power depends on the ability to 
compete effectively in world markets mosbacher said the growth 
of commerce both nationally and internationally is the key to 
guaranteeing that americas most productive and prosperous days are 
still ahead 
mosbacher defended the administrations decision last month to 
target japan brazil and india for erecting barriers to sales of 
american goods 
if the countries do not agree to remove the barriers the 
administration has the power under the new trade law to retaliate by 
imposing 100 percent tariffs against selected imports from those 
countries 
other nations have complained that the administrations decision 
was highhanded and risked plunging the world into a global trade 
war 
but mosbacher said that the administrations decision in 
targeting the three nations was done not in defiance of the 
multilateral trade system but to expand it by opening foreign 
markets 
mosbacher who was one of the leading proponents of the more 
aggressive trade stance within the administration said that the 
united states needed such an effort to whittle down the huge trade 
imbalances that currently exist 
we firmly reject any slide toward protectionism mosbacher 
said but there are disturbing trends in the trade picture 
subsidies distribution systems industrial policies and even the 
economic structure of some countries have led to a reliance on 
exports without a willingness to import 
mosbacher said however that he was encouraged by recent talks 
he held with officials of the european economic community over how 
american companies will be treated once a unified european market is 
established in 1992 
he said he had received a commitment that us products will be 
treated equally with european products for testing and certification 
and the european standardsetting committees will consider the 
comments made by american companies before drawing up final 
regulations 
mosbacher hailed these comments as an important step forward 
in an area of major concern to us companies who had feared that 
the standards would be drawn in such a way as to keep american 
products off european store shelves 
we believe that the economic unification of europe will be 
good for europe and that it can be a positive force for the united 
states and the rest of the world if implemented in the open manner 
being discussed by european leaders he said

iranian parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani flies to moscow on tuesday to seek military aid and boost 
relations between the islamic republics new leadership and the 
kremlin in the postkhomeini era 
during his longdelayed visit originally scheduled for last 
fall rafsanjani is expected to sign major longterm economic 
agreements that will strengthen tehrans increasing ties with his 
countrys northern neighbor and the communist bloc 
he also is to visit budapest and sofia where he is expected to 
finalize 10year cooperation agreements that will include hungarian 
and bulgarian aid in developing irans arms industry 
rafsanjani is the highestranking iranian leader to visit the 
soviet capital 
the departure of such a key political figure at a time when iran 
is undergoing a transition of power following ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis death june 3 underlined the importance tehran attaches to 
bolstering relations with moscow following the august 1988 
ceasefire in the war with iraq 
the soviets have been courting the iranians for several years 
even during the war when they were iraqs main arms supplier 
western sources said the soviets quietly provided weapons to iran 
as well although not in the same quantities 
but iran in the long run is a bigger prize than iraq as the 
americans well know said one western diplomat 
now that khomeinis gone the contest for influence in iran is 
likely to increase the soviets and the east bloc are signing 
economic agreements that are whittling down western opportunities 
he said on condition of anonymity 
relations between moscow and tehran were strained for years 
particularly after the iranians cracked down on the promoscow tudeh 
party in 1981 
but once the soviets began moving out of afghanistan irans 
eastern neighbor where it still backs moslem guerrillas fighting the 
marxist kabul government relations warmed quickly 
khomeini sealed the new relationship in january by sending soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev an unprecedented letter praising his 
policies of perestroika and glasnost 
gorbachevs reply carried to iran by foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said conditions are ripe for relations between our 
countries to enter a qualitiatively new stage of cooperation in all 
fields 
the iranians and soviets have highlighted their expanding 
economic cooperation but they have said little about what western 
sources say are the burgeoning military links between tehran and the 
east bloc 
the soviet deputy foreign minister yuri vorontsov told irans 
official islamic republic news agency last month after visiting 
tehran there is nothing to limit the cooperation between our two 
countries 
irna quoted him as saying we can effectively help each other 
and cooperate to solve important problems including the 
enhancement of military forces 
tehrans radical abrar daily said recently there are no major 
obstacles in the way of mutual cooperation especially soviet 
participation in irans reconstruction moscow can help iran in 
many technical and scientific fields 
rafsanjani who is emerging as irans strongman following 
khomeinis death said june 8 he would not be seeking to buy weapons 
from moscow 
but western intelligence officials and analysts have reported 
that iran seeking to rebuild its armed forces after a series of 
defeats in the war with iraq is desperate to upgrade its depleted 
air force and armored forces 
western sources said iran has signed military cooperation 
agreements with czechoslovakia a major european arms manufacturer 
romania and yugoslavia for the purchase of hardware ranging from 
armored vehicles to jet fighters 
although there has been no official confirmation irans deputy 
foreign minister ali mohammad besharati told the tehran times last 
month that iran soon would buy soviet weapons and was negotiating 
with other countries to buy advanced fighterbombers 
he said extensive talks have been held with soviet officials 
who have been shuttling in and out of tehran for months and that 
all related issues have been finalized 
he did not identify the countries with which iran was 
negotiating but western military sources believe the bargaining 
centers on yugoslavia and romania both visited by iranian president 
ali khamenei in april 
china a key arms supplier that khamenei has also visited 
recently also figures prominently in tehrans efforts to build up 
its military 
a senior us defense department source said the iranians are 
putting a lot of emphasis on rebuilding their military faster 
actually than we really expected theyre talking of spending in 
the range of 20 billion over the next four to five years

conservative leader constantine mitsotakis 
offered monday to form an interim government with rival leftists for 
the sole purpose of cleaning up scandals left by the regime of 
premier andreas papandreou 
mitsotakis centerright new democracy party finished first in 
sundays elections defeating papandreous panhellenic socialist 
movement but failed to win a majority needed to govern 
a leftistcommunist coalition which finished third has emerged 
as the likely power broker in the battle to form a coalition 
government 
both mitsotakis and papandreou earlier said they would reject 
support from the coalition but both made conciliatory overtures to 
the group after the balloting 
the possibility remained that papandreou despite sundays 
secondplace finish could return as premier if mitsotakis cannot 
form a government 
papandreou met monday with president christos sartzetakis the 
ceremonial head of state and submitted his resignation but he was 
asked to remain as caretaker premier until a new government was 
formed 
mitsotakis meets with the president on tuesday to receive a 
threeday exploratory mandate to form a government if he fails 
papandreou will receive the same opportunity to build a coalition 
if neither can form a majority the president is to appoint a 
caretaker government to prepare for new general elections 
but mitsotakis at a news conference proposed leading an interim 
governing coalition that would last only a few months before new 
elections are held 
the express purpose of this government would be the 
punishment of those guilty of the scandal of the century 
unprecedented in recent greek history said mitsotakis referring 
to a multimilliondollar banking scandal that plagued papandreous 
government 
mitsotakis said he would be prepared to include one or two 
representatives from the communist alliance in his interim cabinet 
mitsotakis said because of political differences with the left 
parties this government will not be able to tackle issues like a 
new bases agreement with the united states 
a pact that allows the united states to maintain military bases 
in greece expired in december and the nations have been trying to 
negotiate a new accord for two years 
mitsotakis said the interim government if it is formed also 
would not be able to deal with a us demand for the extradition of 
alleged palestinian terrorist mohammed rashid wanted for 
involvement in the bombing of a pan am jetliner over hawaii in 1982 
the government will have a strictly limited mandate to carry 
out the catharsis and cannot face such issues he said 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said composition of the eventual greek government is a choice that 
the people of greece must make our alliance with greece is 
important 
leaders of the leftist coalition had no comment on mitsotakis 
offer and were expected to meet to weigh their options 
papandreou beset by financial scandals a highly publicized 
divorce from his american wife and a backlash over an extramarital 
affair with a woman half his age was trying to win a third straight 
fouryear term in office 
the premier and ranking members of his party were accused of 
involvement in a scandal in which 200 million allegedly was 
embezzled by the chairman of the bank of crete george koskotas 
papandreou has rejected koskotas charges that he and members of 
his socialist administration masterminded the embezzlement koskotas 
is in a massachusetts jail awaiting an extradition hearing 
members of papandreous party met monday to decide if they would 
try to retain power by proposing a coalition with the leftists 
papandreous party dropped from 154 to 125 seats in the 
300member parliament after sundays election new democracy 
captured 144 seats seven short of a majority 
the coalition of the left and progress an alliance of the 
moscoworiented greek communist party and the greek left party took 
29 seats and could play power broker 
leftist coalition chief harilaos florakis said before mitsotakis 
made his offer that the coalition would fight against the 
conservative policy of new democracy and any other conservative 
policy 
papandreou thanked his supporters on monday for denying an 
absolute majority to the forces of conservatism he hinted at a 
possible coalition offer noting that the socialists and the leftist 
coalition together would form a majority 
papandreou came to power in 1981 on an antiamerican platorm and 
vowing to pull greece out of nato and the eec the realities of 
ruling altered his positions 
mitsotakis an advocate of supplyside economics and less 
government interference favored closer cooperation with the united 
states and western industrial interests

youths with firebombs and steel rods attacked 
people and tried to seize a police station in kazakhstan tass 
reported monday it was the second soviet central asian republic to 
explode in violence in recent weeks 
tass said people were killed but did not gave a figure 
the official news agnecy said the rioting began friday night in 
novy uzen a town in western kazakhstan about 1050 miles southeast 
of moscow known for its oil and gas processing plants 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported sunday the unrest 
began with a fight between two gangs at a discotheque they 
overturned kiosks smashed windows and doors and set several cars on 
fire the newspaper said 
the tass dispatch indicated the disturbances have gone on despite 
police attempts to restore order 
outrageous elements have formed groups armed with sticks 
steel rods and stones they are staging pogroms in houses stores 
and administrative buildings and are attacking passersby in housing 
developments and on city streets tass said 
the gangs also using guns and firebombs tried to seize the 
police station water supply systems and other vital facilities in 
the city the news agency reported public transport has been 
paralyzed and some businesses have had to close 
in neighboring uzbekistan rioting targeted at an ethnic 
minority the meskhi turks began in late may and about 100 people 
were killed on monday authorities pledged to create 200000 jobs 
clean up polluting factories and grow more food in that region to 
stem the economic and environmental problems behind the unrest 
kazakhstan where the new unrest flared was the scene of the 
first major outbreak of ethnic violence under president mikhail s 
gorbachev crowds rioted in december 1986 in the republican capital 
alma ata after the leader of the local communist party an ethnic 
kazakh was replaced by an ethnic russian two people were killed 
there was no indication however that ethnic factors were behind 
the novy uzen rioting 
komsomolskaya pravda traced the trouble to economic factors and 
social tension it said the rampaging youths demand an end to 
rationing because of shortages rationing has been imposed in many 
parts of the soviet union on meat butter and sugar 
the youths also demanded closure of cooperatives the private 
businesses formed under gorbachevs economic reforms the newspaper 
said they believe cooperatives have caused food shortages and 
driven up prices it said 
the gangs also said workers brought into the region make more 
money and are taking jobs that could go to local youths the 
newspaper said 
soviet central asia with the highest birthrate in the country 
has a labor surplus and job shortage 
the communist party daily pravda quoting an uzbekistan 
government commission report said food processing plants and sewing 
factories would be opened in administrative buildings if necessary 
to provide 200000 new jobs in the troubled fergana valley by the 
end of 1990 
it said unspecified steps would be taken to end the concentration 
on cotton production some activists charge that cotton production 
boosted by huge amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is 
poisoning the land and leading to malnutrition in a republic once 
known for its fruits and vegetables 
this is very positive but they had to think about it much 
earlier said the leader of the uzbek grassroots movement berlik 
abdurakhim pulatov 
pulatov in a telephone interview from tashkent the uzbekistan 
capital said he did not believe 200000 jobs could be created so 
quickly 
rioting that broke out in the area pitted ethnic uzbeks against 
the meskhi minority which was forcibly resettled to the region from 
the southern republic of georgia by soviet dictator josef stalin in 
1944 
authorities and residents differ on the reasons for the arson and 
murder rampage that prompted the dispatch of 9000 soldiers and 
evacuation of about 16000 meskhi turks 
some news reports have blamed berlik for the violence but 
pulatov rejected the charge

fourteen republican senators including the 
ranking gop member of the senate judiciary committee questioned the 
party loyalty of new york attorney robert b fiske jr and urged 
president bush on monday not to nominate him as deputy attorney 
general 
it does not appear that mr fiske shares the basic approach to 
matters of legal and judicial policy which you so effectively 
articulated in your winning campaign for president the senators 
said in a letter to bush 
we therefore respectfully urge you to reconsider this matter 
and select a nominee with a demonstrated commitment to your 
principles and those of the republican platform in these important 
areas the senators said 
the letter was signed by sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking 
gop member on the senate judiciary committee and 13 other senators 
it is unclear whether the letter will persuade bush not to 
nominate fiske but it signals that fiske would face tough 
questioning from some republican senators during senate confirmation 
hearings before the judiciary committee 
on friday well after the republicans began circulating the 
letter to collect signatures bush appeared to endorse fiske who 
has been recommended by attorney general dick thornburgh 
at a gathering of federal prosecutors at the white house bush 
noted that his administration included several former us attorneys 
in key positions 
we hope to see yet another bob fiske of new york joining 
our ranks here soon the president said without elaboration 
the 14 mostly conservative senators said they had serious 
concerns about fiske based on his tenure as chairman of the 
american bar associations standing committee on federal judiciary 
according to the june 14 letter that was released monday 
the senators contend that during fiskes chairmanship the panel 
improperly applied ideological criteria to thwart the nominations 
of various wellqualified candidates that thenpresident reagan 
had nominated to the federal bench 
the senators said fiske a pillar of the new york legal 
establishment who onced served as us attorney in manhattan gave 
liberal organizations the names of people under consideration for 
judgeships 
such leaks permitted groups opposed to the presidents judicial 
philosophy to attack the candidates and prevent their nomination 
the letter said 
fiske and the aba have acknowledged that two liberal 
organizations were given the names of prospective nominees for the 
purpose of determining if the candidates had ever shown bias against 
women or minorities 
but the aba denies that it ever used ideological criteria to 
determine a lawyers professional fitness to serve as a judge 
the letter also was signed by sens malcolm wallop rwyo kit 
bond rmo dan coats rind jesse helms rnc james mcclure 
ridaho conrad burns rmont bill armstrong rcolo gordon 
humphrey rnh steve symms ridaho charles grassley riowa 
trent lott rmiss connie mack rfla and thad cochran rmiss 
a signature noticeably absent from the letter was that of sen 
orrin hatch rutah who is an outspoken critic of aba judicial 
screening and also is a member of the judiciary committee hatch 
spokesman paul smith said the senator decided against signing the 
letter after meeting recently with fiske 
though he didnt like what fiske did in the beginning he still 
thought he ought to hear what fiske had to say about his judicial 
screening role smith said hatch didnt make a commitment for or 
against fiske smith said 
the justice department has said fiske would play no role in 
selecting judges for the federal bench if he became the departments 
no 2 official 
fiskes contribution of 1000 to the 1988 democratic primary 
campaign of a us senate candidate in vermont also reinforced our 
doubts about mr fiskes commitment to our partys philosophy the 
senators said 
fiske donated the money to the campaign of william gray a former 
us attorney in vermont with whom he served in the justice 
department gray has been described by justice department officials 
as an old friend of fiske 
gray lost to thenrep jim jeffords in last falls election

transplants of tissue from human fetuses offer 
hope in treating aids and other diseases doctors said monday but 
they acknowledged the need to resolve ethical questions surrounding 
the practice 
antiabortionists have denounced procedures involving the use of 
tissue from fetuses obtained through spontaneous or induced 
abortions 
the transplants mostly brain and glandular tissue are supported 
by the american medical associations council on scientific affairs 
and its council on ethical and judicial affairs 
the councils urged continued federal funding for the transplants 
in a joint report discussed monday during the amas annual 
policymaking convention 
the report notes that fetaltissue transplants have led to the 
development of a number of important research and medical advances 
but dr george m bohigian chairman of the science council and 
dr russel h patterson jr chairman of the judicial group 
acknowledge the ethical dilemmas posed by such research 
at issue is the possibility that a decision to have an abortion 
will be coupled with a decision to donate fetal tissue for 
transplantation they wrote in the report 
the use of fetal tissue for transplantation purposes is 
ethically permissable when a number of conditions are met they 
wrote these conditions include 
the recipient of the tissue is not designated by the donor 
a final decision regarding abortion is made before initiating 
discussion of the transplantation use of fetal tissue 
fetal tissue is not provided in exchange for financial 
remuneration above that which is necessary to cover reasonable 
expenses 
the authors note that the acquisition and use of tissue obtained 
from dead fetuses is governed by the uniform anatomical gift act 
which has been adopted by all states and the district of 
columbia 
the act permits the donation of fetal tissue for research 
purposes with the consent of either parent and without objection 
from the other 
however several states have restrictive statutes governing the 
donation of fetal tissue for research 
massachusetts and michigan laws prohibit abortion if it is 
conditional on the use of the fetal tissue for research the doctors 
note 
and arizona law bars postmortem use of fetal remains for any 
medical experimentation if the tissue is derived from an induced 
abortion they note 
in one recent study involving human fetal tissue liver cells and 
bits of thymus and lymph glands transplanted into mice with impaired 
immune systems helped make those systems function properly the 
doctors wrote that the effort may become a valuable model in 
studying acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
fetal brain tissue transplants also could offer promising 
advances in the treatment of diabetes and parkinsons disease they 
said fetal brain cells are still capable of growth unlike adult 
brain cells 
transplants using tissue from a fetus after spontaneous or 
induced abortion would appear to be analogous to the use of cadaver 
tissue and organs the report said 
the principal ethical concern in the use of human fetaltissue 
transplants is the degree to which the decision to have an abortion 
is separated from the decision to donate the postmortem tissue 
the doctors wrote 
safeguards to reduce any motivation reason or incentive by 
the woman to have an abortion can be developed to allow the benefits 
of this procedure to be made available to those who are in need of 
improved therapies 
the report was submitted monday to a committee which will decide 
whether to offer the recommendations to the amas policymaking 
house of delegates 
official ama policies are to be adopted tuesday wednesday and 
thursday the last day of the fiveday meeting

cleanup of alaskan beaches three months after 
the exxon valdez oil spill is progressing well but more manpower 
and double shifts still may be needed coast guard commandant paul 
a yost told congress on monday 
the beaches are not going to be crystal pure at the end of this 
summer said yost testifying on the bush administrations 
proposed 347 billion coast guard budget for fiscal 1990 yost was 
in alaska inspecting the cleanup earlier this month 
he told the senate commerce science and transportation committee 
that some oil has seeped two to three feet deep into cobble and 
gravel along the shore and it could take five to seven years for 
mother nature to deal with the damage 
yost said exxon is spending 100 million a week on the cleanup 
its progressing well he said but added that progress was 
slower on beaches outside prince william sound 
the valdez spilled 10 million gallons of oil after running into a 
reef in the sound on march 24 the ships captain joseph hazelwood 
faces several charges in connection with the spill 
yost said exxon has pledged to clean up enough miles of beach 
each week to complete the work by the end of the summer he said if 
the company lags behind the schedule he would call for additional 
manpower and hours 
yost said the administrations budget request except for 244 
million to build a new icebreaker amounts to a 36 percent increase 
over fiscal 1989 appropriations 
the icebreaker is needed to increase the us fleet to three 
which still would be two below the number of such ships in the fleet 
in 1987 
we cannot carry out the vital missions of this country in the 
arctic and the antarctic with just two icebreakers he said 
yost said he had no objection to a proposal by some members of 
congress to lease rather than buy an icebreaker as long as the 
40 million annual lease payments came from a separate 
appropriation the proposed 30year lease would put longterm cost 
of the ship at 12 billion

the state department accused nicaragua on 
monday of attempting to restrict outside monitoring of its electoral 
process by imposing visa requirements on american citizens 
if nicaragua wants to hold elections which will enjoy respect 
both internally and in the international community it should not be 
restricting access but should be expanding it department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
right now the question of the new visa requirement inevitably 
inspires is what do you have to hide 
americans had been exempted in recent years from from visa 
requirements as part of a nicaraguan effort to draw tourists and to 
obtain hard currency in other ways 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega announced the new visa 
requirement on friday saying the measure was necessary to prevent 
the united states from meddling in nicaraguan internal affairs 
the yankee have reached the extreme of wanting to direct the 
electoral process in nicaragua they want to come to do what we 
nicaraguans must do we cant permit this he said 
nicaragua is scheduled to hold presidential elections next 
february

south carolina electric amp gas co crews worked around the clock 
through the weekend to restore service but some 10000 to 15000 
customers remained powerless monday spokesman brian duncan said

tomorrow tuesday night before everythings back on duncan said

on dry ice using outdoor grills to cook frozen meat before it could 
spoil and using batteryoperated lamps

fans doors are open much as we can weve got to keep security 
at the bryton pointe apartment complex in northern columbia

poles and 100 miles of wire said bill lide another sceampg spokesman

have left on the ground is splinters and a tangle of electrical 
wires

than 70 mph were recorded during the height of wednesdays storm 
pepco distributed 450000 pounds of dry ice to keep food cool

decision to reject chiles request for the extradition of sergio 
buschmann a chilean guerrilla leader 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration concluded that the us government did not have the 
ability to proceed in obtaining an arrest warrant from a us court 
to detain buschmann based on the chilean preventivedetention 
request 
the offenses for which his preventive detention were sought 
were not extraditable under the specific terms of the 1900 treaty 
she said 
the spokesman at the chilean embassy here was not immediately 
available for comment 
a state department official insisting on anonymity said chile 
wanted buschmann extradited for illegally importing arms into the 
country the official said us legal experts contended there was no 
legal basis for approving the extradition and that chilean 
authorities were very disappointed by the us decision 
buschmann wanted in chile in connection with an assassination 
attempt against president augusto pinochet in 1986 was en route 
from australia to sweden when he was arrested june 12 during a 
stopover at anchorage alaska he was arrested at the request of

permitted to leave the united states under escort officials said 
buschmann has been a spokesman for the manuel rodriguez patriotic 
front chiles principal leftist guerrilla group two years ago he 
escaped from a prison in chile where he faced armssmuggling 
charges 
the chilean government sought buschmanns extradition while he 
was in australia but the australian government deported him on 
grounds he engaged in unacceptable activities in australia he 
was raising funds for the guerrilla group and publicly called for 
the assassination of pinochet 
the united states has been attempting unsuccessfully for more 
than 10 years to obtain the extradition from chile of three security 
officers wanted in the 1976 slaying of ambassador orlando letelier

stanford university graduates sunday to challenge cherished 
assumptions and ask tough questions 
the impertinent question is the glory and engine of human 
inquiry trudeau told 3500 graduates and their families at the 
universitys 98th commencement 
historys movers framed their questions in ways that were 
entirely disrespectful of conventional wisdom said trudeau 40 
who cited as examples albert einstein charles darwin thomas 
jefferson and pablo picasso 
americas political system depends on its noisy dissent its 
raucaous squabbles its competing visions of how it should work 
he added 
although trudeaus talk was generally serious the pulitzer 
prizewinning cartoonist on occasion drew laughter from the audience 
of 25000

prevent graduating seniors from being released into the real world 
before theyve been properly sedated said trudeau who apologized 
for taking 15 minutes of the students time 
it will go faster if you think of it as the equivalent of four

matchmaking is more than a shell game to 
this group of loveseeking turtle boosters 
the westchester chapter of the california turtle and tortoise 
club held its 25th annual show saturday drawing more than 500 
people many of them on the lookout for mates 
i need to find a mate said one owner he paces up and down 
in front of the mirror thinking hes got a girl 
rose bumgard of lomita said her yearold male turtle was sure 
active sexually i feel kind of sorry for him 
she explained i found out here that theyre 10 to 15 years old 
before they can have babies 
there are few swinging single turtles available these days show 
delegates said 
it is illegal to sell many of the creatures in california so 
unless the pets are a gift the potential tortoise or turtle owner 
must go through an adoption agency like the california turtle and 
tortoise club 
the clubs waiting list already exceeds two years 
the shows biggest turtle tribute was displayed by peggy nichols 
who has become known as the turtle lady of long beach 
her red sweatsuit was speckled with turtle patches and pins her 
tables were clustered with turtle jewelry turtle pictures turtle 
eggs and a dollhouse with live couch potato turtles lounging in 
front of a television set 
its a hobby that just got out of hand said ms nichols who 
calls her home nichols turtle haven 
she said she owns about 40 breeds of turtles and tortoises 
requiring that she get up at 4 am every day to feed them 
you look at most people here they start out with one and then 
they get another and then they breed them she said with a shrug 
i think we all really need a psychiatrist

in just over 36 minutes on monday two recent 
high school graduates from washington state assembled a car 
distributor found a fault in the new assembly and fixed it 
repaired a fuelinjector cap got a faulty headlight to work and 
made instrument and dashboard lights work properly 
for that they picked up a 2500 scholarship each and a trophy 
that marks them as the best high school auto technicians in the 
country 
mike seresun 17 and walter yagen 18 of ingraham high school 
in seattle beat out 49 other state finalist teams in the 40th annual 
troubleshooting contest sponsored jointly by the american 
automobile association and plymouth it was the second consecutive 
victory for a washington team 
they were followed in order by teams from iowa pennsylvania 
texas connecticut alabama missouri arkansas rhode island and 
oregon 
each team got to the finals by winning a series of local and 
national written examinations and handson competitions the written 
examinations provided 40 percent of the final score but the real 
test was the repair work done in the shadow of the capitol 
fifty brandnew plymouths identically bugged were put before 
the teams along with a work order that listed customer complaints 
engine wont start faulty headlights checkengine light 
on and inoperative instrument and dash lights 
it didnt take the young mechanics long to find that one reason 
the engine wouldnt start was because it lacked a distributor on 
request the teams were handed a distributor disassembled and in a 
plastic bag 
ah but there was a rub one of the parts in the bag a 
distributor pickup plate was faulty and the mechanics had to find 
and fix that too the headlight problem too was a trick the low 
beam on the bulb was broken and some of the kids merely replaced it 
without checking and finding that a fuse controlling the high beam 
was defective too 
tj rebert a trainer for goodyears training center and one of 
the judges gave demerits to a utah team that installed a gasket 
improperly he said the car would run well but would have trouble 
5000 miles later when moisture got into places it shouldnt 
in fact he said pointing to the last car still under repair if 
that car wasnt fixed at all the mechanics would come out ahead of 
the ones who put that gasket in wrong because its better to tell 
customers that the car isnt ready than to send them on the road 
with one that will break down

syrian and christian troops battled with 
tanks and mortars in hills above beirut monday while syrian 
artillerymen shelled the coastline of the christian enclave north of 
the capital 
a police spokesman said no casualties were reported 
at least 373 people have been killed and 1450 wounded since the 
syrians and christians began shelling duels march 8 
both sides have ignored a ceasefire called by the arab league 
three weeks ago to end the latest round in the 14yearold civil war 
between moslem and christian forces 
a communique from christian army commander gen michel aouns 
office accused the syrian army of firing at a christian garrison in 
the hilltop town of souk elgharb southeast of beirut with tanks 
and 130mm mortars 
our garrison struck back with similar weapons at the sources of 
fire around souk elgharb the communique said 
it said the syrians also fired artillery barrages at the 
presidential palace in suburban baabda where aoun lives in an 
underground bunker but there were no direct hits 
souk elgharb an abandoned mountain resort is atop a network of 
roads leading from the syriancontrolled druse heartland in the 
chouf region southeast of beirut to christian zones north and 
northeast of the capital 
beirut newspapers have reported the possibility of a syrian 
offensive to capture souk elgharb and open the way for an attack on 
baabda if arab league efforts to stabilize the ceasefire fail 
in damascus the syrian capital vice president abdulhalim 
khaddam told the opening session of an arab lawyers congress that 
syria supports efforts by a threemember arab league committee to 
end the civil war within six months 
leaders of the committeee formed during last months arab league 
summit in casablanca are king hassan ii of morocco king fahd of 
saudi arabia and algerian president chadli bendjedid 
the system in lebanon must be changed sectarianism must fall 
and reforms are needed so that all citizens become equal khaddam 
told the lawyers 
he was referring to moslem demands for an equal share of power 
that would end the christians traditional supremacy in lebanon 
aoun belongs to the maronite catholic church and maronite 
leaders have dominated the country since independence from france in 
1943 when christians were considered the majority moslems now make 
up an estimated 55 percent of lebanons multifaith population 
khaddam also indirectly attacked iraq syrias main arab foe for 
backing aouns mostly christian troops 
those encouraging the small minority who is dealing with israel 
should know that the lebanese people have already defeated israel 
altogether he said 
iraq has declared its support of aouns war of liberation 
against 40000 syrian troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
police said mondays coastal bombardment came from syrian 
positions in and around moslem west beirut and was aimed at the 
christian ports of jounieh byblos and amsheet 
the shelling has preventing ships carrying food fuel and arms 
from reaching the christian enclave where aouns 20000 troopers 
are based 
the latest round of fighting began two days after aouns units 
blockaded ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut aoun 
said the ports were illegal and denied the state treasury about 100 
million annually in customs fees 
the syrians retaliated by blockading the christian enclave where 
an estimated 1 million people live

housing secretary jack kemp told the 
nations mayors wednesday that the scandals at his department wont 
affect his pledge to fight poverty and bring opportunity to blighted 
inner cities 
i want to assure you that i am going to work continuously for 
these great goals and were going to reform the us housing 
agency from stem to stern simultaneously kemp said thats my 
pledge to you 
kemp secretary of housing and urban development appeared before 
more than 200 of the nations city leaders gathered for the annual 
us conference of mayors meeting 
he repeated his pledge to clean up his department which has been 
beset by allegations of fraud embezzlement and political influence 
peddling kemp described his department as engulfed by headlines and 
said he had taken steps to remove politics from decisions on where 
federal urban aid will go 
democrats and republicans need to read my lips its open to 
everybody on the basis of need as opposed to greed as it existed 
in the past kemp said 
speaking to reporters later kemp refused to comment on whether 
his predecessor samuel pierce who served as hud secretary 
throughout the reagan administration was responsible for the 
problems at the department 
im not going to make a political judgment about any past 
secretary because i think its unseemly of me kemp said 
kemp said reform of the agency would be added to his goals of 
encouraging home ownership and resident management of public 
housing moving aginst homelessness fighting drugs in housing 
projects and using urban enterprise zones to create jobs in cities 
kemp followed republican national chairman lee atwater who 
delivered a partisan pledge to push gop candidates for mayor 
particularly in new york and to recruit blacks as candidates for 
city offices 
if we can establish a political beachhead in a city like new 
york thats going to be a shot heard around the country atwater 
said referring to the race against democratic mayor edward koch 
atwaters remarks stirred strong reaction among some in the 
overwhelmingly democratic crowd of mayors 
philadelphia mayor wilson goode a black and a democrat called 
atwaters remarks insulting and said were not here for a 
partisan campaign speech we need to hear what the republican party 
intends to do about the issues facing the cities 
atwater said the republican party is not opposed to spending 
more money on the cities we just want to be careful to spend 
taxpayers money on projects that work he offered no further 
specifics 
new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy questioned atwaters remarks 
noting that they were delivered in a hotel and convention center 
financed in part with federal urban development action grants a 
program that the reagan administration succeeded in having killed 
i dont understand which programs hes talking about because 
the ones that worked they killed barthelemy said in an interview 
atwater singled out for introduction one black republican mayor 
james a garner of hempstead ny but mistakenly first said 
garner was from schenectady ny 
garner said later he was not embarrased by the gaffe chairman 
atwater knows my name and who i am he said 
trenton nj mayor arthur holland later quipped i think lee 
atwater assumed that we had arranged a recruitment opportunity for 
him 
holland who is retiring after 26 years as mayor because of 
illness and is stepping down as president of the us conference of 
mayors was given the conferences distinquished public service 
award 
president bushs absence from the meeting has been a subject of 
debate among mayors and kemp pledged to do all he could to get bush 
to the mayors next meeting in january

solidarity captured eight of nine seats 
open to the opposition in runoff national elections and voters 
rejected several prominent communists according to unofficial 
returns monday 
progressive communists beat hardliners in several races sunday 
further shattering the ruling partys prestige after the independent 
union movements victories in the first round of voting june 4 
the party is faced with the most serious problems in its whole 
history politburo member leszek miller said in an interview 
monday with the communist party newspaper trybuna ludu 
the postelection shock has brought about a need for a deep 
analysis of the situation he said 
sundays elections were for communists and allies who failed to 
win the 50 percent of votes necessary to claim seats reserved for 
them in the june 4 elections 
of 295 seats being decided in the sejm or lower house of 
parliament only one was open to the opposition 
eight undecided senate seats all open to the opposition also 
were contested sunday solidarity won seven of the seats in the 
freely elected senate building its dominance in the new chamber to 
99 of 100 seats 
only the victory of rich fodder farmer henryk stoklosa denied 
solidarity a clean sweep in the senate stoklosa waged polands most 
expensive election campaign plastering his province with 
advertisements and hosting picnics with free beer and sausages 
solidarity union clinched the last of 161 sejm seats available to 
independent candidates according to results provided by local 
election commissions to local solidarity citizens committees 
andrzej wybranski the lone solidarity candidate for the sejm who 
did not win june 4 appeared sure of victory 
the senate has veto power over laws passed in the sejm but 
because solidarity won all seats alloted it in the sejm that body 
will be unable to generate the twothirds majority needed to 
override a senate veto 
several communist hardliners including warsaw party leader 
janusz kubasiewicz manfred gorywoda of the southern industrial 
region of katowice and construction minister bogumil ferensztajn 
failed to win sunday

the faa is giving pay hikes of up to 20 
percent at the busiest airports and traffic control centers to 
encourage employees to work there us transportation secretary 
samuel skinner said monday 
the program which took effect sunday gives raises to about 
2100 workers at 11 federal aviation administration centers in the 
new york chicago los angeles and oakland calif areas 
the agency has had difficulty staffing those facilities with 
qualified personnel because living costs complex operations and 
other factors make them unattractive places to work faa officials 
said 
the 5year demonstration program will become permanent if it 
succeeds and air traffic controllers in the busiest centers will be 
some of the highest paid people in federal government skinner said 
at a news conference near the nations busiest airport ohare 
international 
a toplevel air traffic controller makes 60000 to 65000 a 
year including overtime before the raises he said 
ive been to those centers and frankly i think those jobs 
deserve that kind of compensation skinner said 
in addition to controllers safety inspectors and technicians who 
service and maintain air trafficcontrol computers and other 
equipment are getting raises 
the program will cost about 5 million a year with the funds 
coming out of the departments budget and resulting in minor 
cutbacks in other programs transportation department officials said 
the program is a start in solving some of the problems in the air 
traffic system said tony dresden a spokesman for the national air 
traffic controller association 
it will address shortterm problems dresden said we would 
hope that the faa would look at fair compensation for all 
controllers 
he said union representatives at facilities affected by the 
program indicate it is already working the faa has received a lot 
of applications since the program was announced in march and those 
applying are highly skilled 
natca was certified as the representative of the nations 7000 
air traffic controllers in 1987 replacing the professional air 
traffic controllers organization which was decertified in 1981 
after a nationwide controllers strike 
the payraise program survived attempts by congress to restrict 
it to faa workers at ohare and to limit raises to up to 10 percent 
of base pay department officials said 
in addition to being short of help in new york chicago and los 
angeles many of those working at the affected facilities are 
nearing retirement skinner said 
the secretary also used the news conference to blast the airlines 
and local governments for not adequately planning for a doubling of 
air traffic in the past eight years 
while the federal government also can be blamed for air traffic 
conditions he said it was up to the airlines to come up with 
schedules that take into account airport capacities and to develop 
new facilities 
the faa facilities affected by the incentive plans include air 
traffic control centers in aurora ill and ronkonkoma ny and 
the ohare and los angeles international airport towers and terminal 
radar approach control facilities 
the program also covers approachcontrol facilities at westbury 
ny santa ana and oakland calif and flight standards district 
offices in los angeles farmingdale and valley stream ny and 
teterboro nj

the navy in a letter released monday pulled 
back from a critical assessment of a cruisemissile engine agreement 
with williams international saying the deal has resulted in lower 
prices 
in 1978 williams of walled lake mich signed an agreement 
that would allow a competitor teledyne industries inc to use 
williams technology to build cruisemissile engines for the navy 
in return the navy guaranteed it would buy 240 engines a year from 
williams plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to 1200 
engines annually 
the navy intends to cancel the agreement on grounds that it 
commits the service to future contracts in a way inconsistent with 
procurement laws 
for each of the past 10 years williams has submitted 
competitive prices well below those of its competitor for production 
engines navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii wrote last week in 
a letter to sen carl levin dmich we do believe that the fact 
of competition has benefited the taxpayer by creating an added 
incentive to lower prices 
the letter represented a sharp departure from a letter garrett 
then undersecretary of the navy wrote to levin in april 
then garrett said the agreement with williams was severely 
limiting our contracting options and decision in a manner which we 
believe inconsistent with sound procurement policy and the public 
interest 
in the april letter garrett also said teledynes prices had 
become very competitive with williams beginning last year 
the april letter was leaked by a whistleblower group called the 
project on military procurement levin released last weeks letter 
garrett said the navy still intends to cancel the 1978 agreement 
but said that intention in no way implies criticism of williams 
internationals integrity or performance 
we appreciate the emphasis on ethics that has always been part 
of williams internationals management and we consider it an 
outstanding navy contractor garrett wrote williams has exceeded 
its reliability goals and delivered every engine ahead of the 
contract date 
the associated press sought an explanation from the navy of the 
differences in the two letters lt bruce cole a navy spokesman 
said monday he couldnt comment until he had looked into the matter 
there are some real differences there levin said of the two 
letters maybe he recognizes that his first letter was really not 
the most accurate reflection of the situation 
i havent talked to them nor has my staff levin said

president daniel ortega asked the 
archbishop of managua on monday to petition president bush for talks 
aimed at normalizing usnicaraguan relations 
ortega diclosed this after a 1hour meeting with cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo at the archbishops offices 
the development comes after ortegas leftist sandinista 
government has had to deal with two strikes in the last three weeks 
and after it made last week the most drastic devaluation of the 
nicaraguan currency so far this year 
obando y bravo said in a brief statement that regarding ortegas 
request we are going to think about this and will give an 
answer he did not say when an answer would come and declined to 
talk further with reporters 
ortega said we came to talk about the critical economic 
situation in which the country dwells 
with obando by his side the president said he told the 
archbishop he is worried about the lack of understanding from 
economic sectors regarding the governments program and about the 
ensuing polarization of society here 
also the role the americans could play is important ortega 
said 
he said us policy toward nicaragua does not contribute to the 
strengthening of a climate of peace in nicaragua 
the united states cut off all financial aid to nicaragua in 1981 
and began supporting the antisandinista rebels known as contras it 
accused nicaragua of backing rebels elsewhere in central america and 
of failing to fulfill its pledges of democracy 
ortega noted with appreciation on monday the letter sent this 
year to the united states by about 800 latin american bishops 
asking that washington lift the economic embargo imposed on 
nicaragua in 1985 
we are willing to develop a dialogue with the north american 
government so foundations can be laid for normalizing relations 
between nicaragua and the united states ortega said 
i have asked cardinal obando y bravo to take steps and 
mediate with president bush so that a fluid dialogue can develop 
ortega declined to answer reporters questions 
the last usnicaraguan meeting on normalization was in june 
1984 in manzanillo mexico washington declared an economic embargo 
on nicaragua in 1985 forbidding any us enterprise from doing 
business with the small central american country 
nicaragua announced friday that for the first time americans 
will need visas to enter nicaragua starting july 1 
the state department accused nicaragua on monday of trying to 
restrict outside monitoring of its electoral process with the visa 
requirements 
nicaragua is to hold presidential elections next february 
on may 26 nicaragua expelled two us diplomats accusing them 
of inciting labor unrest to undermine the country the action came 
during wildcat strikes by teachers demanding higher pay and improved 
working conditions 
prices for nearly all goods doubled after the cordoba was 
devalued on june 12 for the 20th time this year coupled with a 110 
percent rise in the price of gasoline that made the official 
exchange rate 20000 cordobas to the dollar instead of 9500 gas 
rose from 17700 cordobas a gallon to 37200 or 186 
taxi drivers struck saying they could not survive with the new 
gas prices some returned to work after progress was made on a 
compromise over the weekend 
ortega toured 10 european countries in april and may seeking 250 
million in aid just for this year he returned with 50 million 
on jan 30 he announced austerity measures aimed at combating 
hyperinflation which surpassed 20000 percent in 1988 measures 
included massive layoffs of public employees slashing new credit 
and investment and pay freezes 
according to government figures the fight against inflation was 
succeeding but the measures also created a recession just at the 
start of the planting season a factor of prime importance for a 
country that derives most of its hardcurrency earnings from 
agricultural exports

application may never surface on a government computer and that 
obtaining an interview would be difficult

lucky i know people mcleod told a congressional hearing monday 
walt schnipper mcloed and a fourth intern rebecca slaven of 
little rock told their experiences to the house governmental 
affairs civil service subcommittee headed by pryor dark 
nothing can be more discouraging and frustrating to a young job 
seeker than finding no one able or willing to answer questions about 
federal job opportunities and the application process pryor said 
walt who plans to attend the university of arkansas law school 
in the fall said he visited the office of personnel management the 
governments personnel agency to get information about federal jobs

said two other men were desperately trying to request a form she 
ignored them too 
schnipper a senior at the university of arkansas was given two 
job application forms and a job description 
i started asking questions about the job and application 
process she said and was interupted by a federal worker who 
said all the answers are on the green form 
i tried one more time to ask a question and she took the green 
form out of my hand and said i dont know any more than what is on 
the form 
mcleod a senior at the university of the ozarks originally was 
told by a federal worker she would possibly never hear about her 
application because she wasnt applying for a specific position 
i then asked for an application for some sort of clerical 
work she said he gave me another form he told me that it 
would still be difficult to get an interview 
slaven a senior at vanderbilt university said she had to reach 
four different people in order to get job information the employee 
she finally reached told her to be quiet and quit interrupting 
and referred her to the office of personnel management

sudans former president gaafar nimeiri on 
monday denied claims by the sudanese government that his supporters 
in khartoum planned a coup but were foiled by the army sudan said 
it arrested 66 people in the plot 
sudanese prime minister sadek mahdi told parliament in khartoum 
on monday that the plot was aimed at manslaughter in parliament 
and at uprooting the democratic system in sudan and serving the 
strategies of other countries 
mahdi did not identify the countries but assailed the feverish 
activities of the bloodthirsty nimeiri in egypt 
nimeiri said from his exile home in cairo that the conspiracy 
story was invented to divert the sudanese peoples attention from 
their problems 
sudans military command said sunday that soldiers and civilians 
loyal to nimeiri were arrested after the plot was discovered it 
implied but did not say their aim was to restore power to the former 
military ruler ousted on april 6 1985 
mahdi said his government will promptly and harshly deal with 
this coup attempt whatever be the price 
his security adviser abdel rahman faraha said 18 military men 
and 48 civilians were arrested in connection with the plot 
sudanese newspapers said earlier monday that 14 army officers 
including six brigadiers and two colonels and 48 civilians were 
arrested one newspaper alsudani said a lieutenant general headed 
the plotters and remained at large 
editor sidahmed khalifa reportedly was arrested his newspaper 
alwatan recently published an interview with nimeiri and said 
nimeiri would return in two weeks 
newspapers quoted security sources as saying the plotters planned 
to strike monday as mahdi addressed parliament they said the plan 
was to surround the assembly building with demonstrators then 
arrest senior government officials trapped inside 
nimeiri scoffed at the reports 
this is a poor plan by the government which is trying to 
divert the masses from their suffering he said in an interview 
the government is trying to increase prices again and they want 
to divert the peoples attention 
nimeiri said he was told sudans interior ministry for weeks 
compiled lists of his supporters intending to arrest them on 
charges of trying to overthrow the government 
they are always arresting people i knew he said six 
months ago they arrested a southern man who used to help my former 
chef they also detained a former butler and five or six distantly 
related relatives of mine 
nimeiri ruled sudan in a mostly prowestern military dictatorship 
for 16 years he contends he enjoys widespread civilian and military 
support at home although none is evident 
the masses are calling for the return of nimeiri because 
they know maybe i can help them he said 
but i am not trying to overthrow the government he said 
nevertheless nimeiri said this month that he sent tapes and 
copies of speeches to sudan in may urging the sudanese to overthrow 
mahdis civilian administration which he called a government of 
thieves 
sudans economy is in a shambles because of a 13 billion foreign 
debt and southern civil war costing 1 million a day 
many small demonstrations protesting inflation and commodity 
shortages have occurred in recent days including sunday before the 
coup plot announcement 
demonstrators on sunday urged a return to military rule unless 
supplies of bread and sugar are increased

a dozen boeing 737400 jetliners operated by 
british airlines remained grounded monday while investigators 
studied what caused some of their engines to crack 
we are waiting to see what investigators find out at the 
factory anne noonan spokesman for britains civil aviation 
authority told the seattle times in a telephone interview from 
england 
the engines are manufactured by cfm international a joint 
venture of americas general electric and snecma of france two of 
the cfm563c engines were sent to snecmas factory near paris last 
week for investigators to look at 
britain grounded the 737400s after planes operated by british 
midland airways and danair made emergency landings when fan blades 
broke in their engines 
boeing and cfm international last tuesday recommended that 
airlines operating planes with such engines ground the aircraft 
until the engines could be replaced or until they were adjusted to 
operate at lower thrust levels 
the federal aviation administration issued a similar order the 
next day for us airlines the only us planes affected were five 
operated by usair and those planes have been given new engines the 
28 other affected 737400s are operated overseas 
the 3c engines are rated to operate at 23500 pounds of thrust 
a similar engine the cfm563b operates at 22000 pounds of thrust 
and the faa said there have been no engine failures at that level in 
more than 6 million hours of flight 
on friday britains caa confirmed a times of london report that 
cracking had been found in the engines as well as in the fan blades 
noonan said the new cracking was found on an engine of a british 
midland plane not involved in the inflight incidents that prompted 
the original grounding 
boeing spokesman craig martin said any new 737400s delivered to 
airlines with 3c engines would have the engines adjusted to 22000 
pounds of thrust before the planes leave boeing assembly plants near 
seattle 
other foreign carriers that operate the affected 737400s are 
icelandair hapag lloyd of germany asiana of south korea braaten 
of norway nortjet of spain and istanbul of turkey martin said 
fixes have been made on many of those planes and they have 
returned to service martin said 
a british midland 737400 crashed after developing engine 
problems in january killing 47 people no cause has been determined 
for that accident in which investigators said the pilot reported 
problems in one engine but mistakenly shut down the other engine

a highroller who contends he lost more than 
200000 in a twoweek spree at an atlantic city casino was plied 
with drugs and alcohol that left him reeling while he placed bets 
his attorney claimed monday 
he was without his senses attorney steven goldman said 
during opening arguments in a lawsuit filed by his client shmuel 
aboud 44 of new york he was literally unconscious at the table 
several times 
the golden nugget casino filed a lawsuit in 1985 against aboud 
seeking payment of gambling debts totaling 27000 that aboud 
amassed at the casino in february 1985 
mr aboud is using the litigation process in an attempt to 
avoid a just debt that he incurred said stephen n dratch an 
attorney for the casino mr aboud wanted to be at the golden 
nugget 
but aboud an israeli citizen filed a counterclaim against the 
casino he said he was deprived of his reason and understanding 
after the casino fraudulently intentionally and maliciously 
offered him alcoholic beverages while he gambled at a blackjack 
table 
at the time aboud was taking percodan a painkiller prescribed 
by two physicians called by the casino to abouds hotel room after 
he complained of back pains sustained in a 1977 car accident 
goldman said 
they were offering him cognacs and drinks to wash it down 
goldman argued before us district court judge mitchell cohen 
goldman said aboud suffered from intoxication to the point of 
unconsciousness but casino officials pressured him to continue to 
gamble 
youre not going to hear tales of drowsiness youre to hear a 
tale of unconsciousness goldman said as aboud a short balding 
man sat tensely behind him occasionally biting his lip 
attorneys involved in the trial which is expected to last about 
a week say the outcome could set a precedent for the states casino 
industry 
it would open the door to an exorbitant amount of fraudulent 
claims by patrons who lose said steven horne who also represents 
the golden nugget it would turn the casino industry on its head 
goldman said aboud lost more than 200000 during his stay in a 
1000aday complimentary hotel room supplied by the casino aboud 
had recently received a 395000 insurance settlement from the car 
accident the attorney said 
this case is about a fishing expedition goldman told the 
eight jurors hearing the civil case they hooked him and they 
didnt let him go until they took every penny from him 
dratch said aboud only lost about 72000 during the spree and 
netted winnings of about 70000 he said aboud took advantage of 
complimentary offers provided by the casino and requested that he be 
flown home to new york to withdraw funds from his bank accounts 
he wants this jury to deal him a better hand than he could 
obtain on his own dratch said his defense is frivolous

the widow of prime minister olof palme 
pointed her finger at defendant christer pettersson on monday and 
identified him as the man confronting her husband the instant he was 
assassinated 
im absolutely certain lisbeth palme told the hushed 
courtroom when asked if pettersson was the man she saw a few feet 
away as palme crumpled to the street with a fatal bullet wound 
palme the leading figure in swedish politics for more than a 
decade was shot and killed feb 28 1986 as he and mrs palme were 
leaving a late movie downtown mrs palme was slightly wounded 
pettersson has declared his innocence 
mrs palme said she clearly saw petterssons face but didnt look 
at his hands to see if he had a gun 
an autopsy report said palme was shot from a distance of about 
eight inches and investigators said only palme his wife and the 
killer were in the immediate vicinity 
mrs palmes testimony was a breakthrough for the prosecution 
which had suffered repeated setbacks since the trial began two weeks 
ago several witnesses had backed away from earlier statements 
implicating pettersson 
pettersson 42 was arrested in december he has a long criminal 
record which includes a conviction for manslaughter and a history 
of drug and alcohol abuse 
it will be difficult to let him go after this if the court 
lets him off they will have to justify their decision said clas 
borgstom a criminal lawyer not directly involved with the case in 
an interview with swedish radio 
defense attorney arne liljeros told a news conference after the 
hearing that his client felt distressed after mrs palmes 
testimony 
he did not discuss mrs palmes statement that she did not see a 
gun but indicated he would concentrate his defense on how the 
suspect was identified during the investigation and the time that 
has passed since the killing he was asked if he considered mrs 
palmes testimony reliable and replied i will return to that 
liljeros said his client maintains his position of innocence 
in all ways 
mrs palme who came into the courtroom supported by her son 
joachim walked sideways to hide her face from the 60 reporters in 
the room 
she had said she would testify on condition that no taped record 
be made of the session that it not be broadcast and that reporters 
be excluded from the courtroom the court agreed to the first two 
conditions but allowed the press inside 
she also had asked that pettersson not be present during her 
testimony he was not in the room while she testified but was 
brought in after a short recess and mrs palme was still on the 
stand 
prosecutor anders helin asked if she could identify the man she 
saw seconds after her husband had been shot mrs palme pointed at 
the defendant sitting 30 feet away 
im certain she said 
if olof palme in his heaven could have heard this he wouldnt 
have liked it said pettersson breaking in over the objections of 
judge carlanton spak if you believe in what youre saying its 
ok but otherwise its not pettersson added before guards took 
him from the room 
mrs palme made no reply 
under crossexamination mrs palme admitted she was uncertain 
about details of the killers clothing on the night of the slaying 
but she stressed several times that his face was lit by streetlights 
and that she had seen it clearly 
im trained in my job to observe things said mrs palme a 
psychologist by training 
my state of shock made me even more observant she said 
thats why i remember his face so clearly 
during police interrogations she has repeatedly refered to 
petterssons eyes as piercing and unforgettable 
mrs palme also lashed out at the news media on the stand saying 
they had tried their best to destroy the investigation

prime minister yitzhak shamir 
responded monday to the stabbing death of a usborn settler by 
promising to smash violence in the occupied territories with an 
iron fist 
hundreds of settlers demonstrated in jerusalem tel aviv and the 
west bank after the weekend slaying of frederick steven rosenfeld a 
former us marine 
how many jews have to die before something is done some 
chanted 
late monday settlers in 50 cars drove to a road junction near 
ariel in the west bank near nablus and threw rocks at arabowned 
vehicles smashing windshields israel radio reported 
the settlers demanded the government take harsher measures to 
quell the 18month palestinian uprising in which 524 palestinians 
and 23 israelis including rosenfeld have died 
shamir called the death another link in the chain of blood of 
violent actions carried out against us by murderers and rioters 
who believe that by these actions they will put an end to our 
settlement and our existence 
israels security forces will uproot this violence with an iron 
fist 
shamir did not elaborate 
israels military command said monday it will extend the closing 
of west bank schools for another month ignoring pleas from the 
united states and human rights groups 
the 1194 schools have been closed for all but a few weeks since 
feb 3 1988 affecting 320000 pupils israel says the schools 
including 145 kindergartens are rallying points for rioters 
in the occupied gaza strip arab doctors said troops wounded 12 
palestinians in clashes monday at three refugee camps including a 
15yearold girl shot in the head the army said it knew nothing of 
the shootings 
in jerusalem 80 jewish settlers blocked the entrance to 
parliament to protest rosenfelds slaying fistfights broke out when 
guards ordered the protesters to disperse army radio said 
west bank police commander chaim malka said police suspect 
palestinians in the killing but are investigating all possibilities 
palestinian shepherds found rosenfelds body sunday on a hill 
between the arab villages of salfit and burkin said avivi shalom 
security chief at ariel settlement in an interview 
rosenfeld 48 had been missing since friday night he liked 
hiking and apparently walked to the barren area from ariel shalom 
said 
it seems as though the assailants surprised him and hit him on 
the head shalom said he said rosenfelds empty pistol holster 
map binoculars and two spent cartridges were found near the body 
the maariv daily said it appeared the settler fired in the 
direction of the assailants 
ariel officials said rosenfeld was a former resident of 
washington and emigrated to israel in 1968 he fought in israels 
army and edited technical manuals in tel aviv before becoming a 
settler 18 months ago 
shamir is under increasing pressure from hawks in his rightwing 
likud bloc to lay aside his plan for elections in the occupied lands 
and first put down the revolt 
i dont see any peace process unless terror and violence will 
be stopped by israel trade minister ariel sharon said monday on 
israel radio 
about 200 protesting settlers honked their horns at 3 am 
outside the tel aviv home of defense minister yitzhak rabin 
chanting rabin resign 
an additional 150 settlers converged on ariel 
rabin on monday appointed maj gen yitzhak mordechai a tough 
paratroop officer as commander of troops in the west bank 
mordechai now chief of the armys southern command has been in 
charge of the gaza strip during the rebellion 
he replaces central command head maj gen amram mitzna who has 
been responsible for the west bank and now will go on study leave 
mitzna has been under fire by rightwing politicians and by 
jewish settlers for what they termed a liberal attitude toward the 
uprising 
the army said maj gen matan vilnai now in charge of army 
personnel will succeed mordechai as southern command chief

conservative opposition leader constantine 
mitsotakis twice has tried to unseat an old foe 
he failed in 1985 when premier andreas papandreous panhellenic 
socialist movement handily defeated him in national elections 
and he achieved only partial success sunday defeating papandreou 
but failing to garner enough votes to win the post he coveted for so 
long 
mitsotakis a lawyer immediately took the offensive monday 
using the skills as a party infighter and strategist that have 
earned him a reputation as an effective parliamentarian 
he appealed to the coalition of the left and progress to join him 
in an interim government to punish the officials responsible for 
scandals that led to the resignation or firing of eight cabinet 
members 
the worst is a 20 million scandal involving the collapse of the 
bank of crete mitsotakis has contended papandreou is responsible 
but the premier denies wrongdoing 
before the election mitsotakis had said he would not accept 
support from the communists the coalition partner of the greek left 
party 
but that was to form a government this he says would be a 
brief partnership to deal with the catharsis or cleansing of the 
government 
hes very tolerant hell listen to anything and not reject it 
before giving it a good amount of thought his 21yearold son 
kyriakos said in a recent interview 
but mitsotakis appeal also demonstrates his political savvy 
acting to offer a temporary solution before papandreou and his 
socialists can forge a more lasting alliance with the coalition 
in contrast to the charismatic papandreou who rarely attended 
parliamentary debates mitsotakis has shown more talent in the 
300seat singlechamber body than as a speaker exciting crowds from 
a podium 
he was elected to lead the new democracy party in 1984 because 
conservatives felt he was the only man capable of dealing with 
papandreou 
his personal feud with papandreou dates back to the 1960s when 
both men were members of the center union party led by george 
papandreou andreas father 
papandreou accuses mitsotakis of being involved in political 
intrigues that led to the collapse of the center union government 
and triggered the 19671974 military dictatorship 
during the junta mitsotakis fled to exile in paris 
eventually he joined the new democrats and held the foreign and 
economic portfolios in the 197481 governments 
his political career began when he was elected to parliament in 
1946 at the age of 28 in his native chania on crete 
he was known on the island as a resistance fighter and organizer 
who twice was sentenced to death by the nazis

premier andreas papandreou may have lost 
his bid for a third term but its too early to write off the man 
who brought greeces first socialist government to power 
the people punished the thieves trumpeted the mass 
circulation newspaper apogevmatini referring to financial scandals 
that triggered the dismissals and resignations of eight members of 
papandreous cabinet 
but despite opposition charges he was involved in the corruption 
the charismatic premier attracted 39 percent of the vote and could 
retain office to lead a coalition government 
i am used to opposition i revel in it papandreou 70 
joked before sundays election referring to the 197481 period his 
party spent in the opposition 
the centerright new democracy party of constantine mitsotakis 
got 45 percent of the vote but failed to win a parliamentary 
majority that raises prospects of a coalition or new elections 
the progressive forces have a majority in parliament we 
remain on the battlements with optimism and certainty of final 
outcome papandreou said monday when he conceded mitsotakis would 
finish ahead of him 
the former us economics professor brought greeces first 
socialist government to power in 1981 with promises of a welfare 
state and calls to close us military bases in greece and withdraw 
from nato and the european economic community 
reality softened his hardline stance and an ailing economy 
forced his government to implement conservative monetary policies 
greece remained in nato became a staunch european community 
supporter and signed an agreement to keep us bases 
the last six months of his second fouryear term were marred by 
allegations of widespread corruption multimilliondollar scandals 
a messy divorce from his americanborn wife margaret and his open 
affair with a woman half his age 
papandreou was born on the aegean sea island of chios he studied 
law at athens university and emigrated to the united states in 1939 
after a military regime expelled him because of his leftist leanings 
he remained an american citizen for more than 20 years and served 
in the us navy in world war ii 
papandreou obtained a doctorate of philosophy in economics from 
harvard taught at several universities and was professor of 
economics at the university of california at berkeley 
his political career began in 1959 when he returned to greece and 
renounced us citizenship he first was elected to parliament in 
1964 as a deputy on the ticket of his fathers center party former 
greek prime minister george papandreous union party 
the younger papandreou served as a cabinet minister and deputy 
minister in 1964 and 1965 
he was expelled a second time by a military dictatorship that 
ruled from 1967 until democracy was restored in 1974 papandreou 
founded his socialist party in 1974

pipe bombs exploded monday at a bank 
of boston branch and a us army recruiting office prior to a senate 
hearing on the islands future political relationship with the 
united states 
police said no one was injured and damage was slight in the 
predawn blasts in bayamon about 15 miles southwest of san juan 
similar explosions with no injuries and minor damage occurred 
friday at a us customs office in the southern city of ponce and 
sunday at a chase manhattan bank branch in the northcentral city of 
caguas 
los macheteros a militant proindependence group that has been 
relatively inactive in recent years claimed responsibility for 
mondays bombings 
in a letter delivered to the associated press in san juan the 
group said it was protesting the farcical hearings being held by 
a senate committee here on a plebiscite planned for 1991 that will 
allow puerto ricans to vote on their future relationship with the 
united states 
the group also cited the jailing of macheteros members in 
connection with the 7 million robbery of a wells fargo depot in 
hartford conn in 1983 
on thursday a federal court in hartford sentenced a macheteros 
member juan segarra palmer to 65 years in prison and fined him 
500000 for his part in the robbery he and three other people were 
convicted in april 
nine others accused of the robbery including alleged macheteros 
leader filiberto ojeda rios are awaiting trial 
the letter said the violence would continue until the united 
states ended its military political and economic presence in puerto 
rico 
the fbi said it was investigating the letter which bore the 
starandmachete logo of the macheteros ejercito popular 
boricua or peoples army of borinquen los macheteros is spanish 
for the machete wielders and borinquen is the indian name for 
puerto rico 
the explosions monday occurred within an hour of each other said 
police spokeswoman maria del pilar bon she said one bomb slightly 
damaged the bank buildings facade and shattered windows of a nearby 
bus terminal the other blast shattered windows of the recruiting 
office 
the us senate energy and natural resources committee held 
hearings in san juan on friday saturday and monday on the proposed 
plebiscite on whether puerto rico should remain a us commonwealth 
become the 51st us state or seek independence 
the caribbean island of 32 million mostly spanishspeaking 
people has been a us commonwealth since 1952 
it will be the first vote on puerto ricos political status since 
1967 when 67 percent voted to remain a us commonwealth 32 
percent for statehood and less than 1 percent for independence 
puerto ricos statehood and independence parties did not actively 
participate in that vote 
sen j bennett johnston dla who presided at the senate 
hearings said at the close of mondays session that the plebiscite 
would be fundamentally different because the three status 
options would be precisely defined and the vote would be binding on 
congress 
under commonwealth puerto ricans are us citizens and eligible 
for federal benefits but they cannot vote for president the island 
received 65 billion in federal money in 1988 
the committees next round of hearings is scheduled for july 
1214 to hear the bush administrations views on the plebiscite 
president bush has said he favors statehood

more than 700 educational institutions could 
lose student financial aid funds because they have failed to meet 
new requirements involving drugs and eligibility for aid the 
education department said monday 
in order for their students to receive certain grants and loans 
schools must now certify that they are drugfree workplaces for 
their lowincome students to receive pell grants they also must 
certify that they do not employ anyone who has been barred from 
receiving money from any federal agency 
the department said 700 schools will not receive their 19891990 
pell grants which the schools disburse to students for tuition 
books and other academic uses if they do not file both 
certifications 
another 180 schools face delay or loss of 19891990 funds for 
campusbased grants loans and workstudy programs if they dont 
submit drugfree workplace forms 
the pell grant suspension and debarment forms were due on june 16 
and the drugfree certifications are due on june 22 the money is 
scheduled for release on july 1 
education secretary lauro cavazos said the number of schools that 
have failed so far to file the necessary certifications amounts to 
nearly 10 percent of all institutions participating in federal 
financial aid programs he said the department has written and 
telephoned all affected institutions in some cases as many as four 
times 
these schools failure to comply with these mandatory 
certifications could have a devastating impact on thousands of 
students nationwide who rely on federal financial aid for 
postsecondary education cavazos said in a statement 
the drugfree workplace certification is part of a 1988 law that 
requires all federal grant recipients and most contractors to 
certify that they have a drugfree work environment the law 
requires specific steps such as notifying employees in writing that 
drug abuse in the workplace is banned and educating employees to the 
dangers of drug abuse and the availability of counseling 
the suspension and debarment certification for pell grants is 
part of a governmentwide regulation designed to make sure that if 
someone has been barred from receiving money from one federal 
agency he or she isnt eligible for federal dollars from another 
agency the same type of certification will be required for the 
campusbased loan grant and workstudy programs next year a 
department official said

the view of the jagged mountain landscape 
seems limitless from atop the great wall all that is missing is the 
click of camera shutters and the gasps of thrilled foreigners 
the tourist season is here but there are few people climbing 
chinas most famous sight the chang cheng or great wall 
few people snap up souvenirs or visit the many restaurants that 
cater to travelers much to the dismay of the chinese who rely on 
tourism for their livelihood 
a chinese man lingering where tourists can begin walking to the 
top of the wall part of a 45mile stretch as mutianyu offered an 
explanation asked about the tourist drought he pantomimes the 
shooting of a machine gun a reference to the governments violent 
military suppression of demonstrators two weeks ago in central 
beijing 
there is so little to do now without the foreigners were very 
tired because were not busy he says 
the crackdown on the demonstrators and the worldwide condemnation 
it has generated have chilled chinas burgeoning tourism industry 
the staterun china international travel service has been 
encouraging foreigners asking about travel within china to continue 
with their plans to visit the vast country saying all areas open to 
tourists are safe 
economically there is much at stake 
earlier this year the national tourism administration released 
figures showing that china earned 22 billion in foreign currency 
from tourism in 1988 up 194 percent from 1987 through last year 
tourism had brought in 12 billion since the country was opened to 
foreign visitors in 1978 the figures show 
the wall which winds over mountains and through valleys is one 
of chinas premier tourist attractions 
at mutianyu about 50 miles north of beijing vendors and 
tickettakers seemed surprised by foreign visitors who came monday 
to see the stone barrier built along chinas northern frontier to 
protect against invasion the great work was begun in the third 
century bc 
two people who wanted to ride a cable car to the top had to hunt 
for someone to sell them tickets after the purchase they looked 
for someone to start the cable car on its way up the mountain 
later at the base of the mountain a vendor pushed for a sale 
he motioned to tshirts and silk quilts displayed on a table at the 
end of a row of about 40 empty stalls 
i give you good deal best deal he said in english 
when a foreigner started to walk away without buying the vendor 
talked faster promising an even better deal 
please buy please buy here good price here i give you best 
price here 
at the nearby yisong restaurant the only person in the dining 
room read a newspaper as he leaned back in his chair his legs 
resting on top of a table 
closed closed the restaurant is closed he said when 
someone entered the room he indicated there were no definite plans 
to reopen 
when more people come to see the great wall we will sell them 
food he said when will that be i dont know

recreation boating fatalities continued a 
steady decline in 1988 to a record low of 946 deaths while the 
number of registered boats increased the transportation department 
said 
coast guard capt bill griswold the services top boating safety 
officer attributed the decline to increased awareness of the danger 
of drinking while boating 
fatalities declined to 946 in 1988 from 1036 in 1987 1066 in 
1986 and 1116 in 1985 the department said the 1988 figure which 
amounted to 55 deaths per 100000 boats was the lowest since the 
coast guard began keeping track of boating fatalities 28 years ago 
the coast guard estimates that there were 173 million boats on 
the nations waterways in 1988 an increase of 400000 over the 
previous year 
griswold said about 50 percent of boating accidents are linked to 
alcohol use alcohol is also a factor in about half the traffic 
fatalities on the nations highways 
the number of injuries in boating accidents decreased only 
slightly from 3501 in 1987 to 3476 last year the number of 
accidents was at 6746 in 1987 and 6718 last year 
property damage in boating accidents reached 2433 million last

the us copyright office recommended monday 
that the same copyright protections guaranteed by other nations for 
their architects creations be extended to works of architecture in 
the united states 
us copyright law prohibits unauthorized copying of 
architectural plans sketches and models but does not prevent 
copycat construction of actual buildings 
the law includes buildings in the same legal category of such 
useful articles as alarm clocks toasters and automobiles which 
are not afforded copyright protection 
the copyright office of the library of congress on monday 
published a lengthy report of a 14month study of the issue 
conducted at the request of rep robert w kastenmeier dwis and 
sen patrick j leahy dvt 
kastenmeier who received the report at a news conference at the 
library of congress said he soon would introduce proposed 
legislation aimed at assuring that the best of american creativity 
is respected and protected he gave no details 
in a move intended to hasten a government decision the frank 
lloyd wright foundation submitted copyright applications for two 
buildings designed by the late architect the guggenheim museum in 
new york city and beth shalom synagogue in elkins park pa a 
philadelphia suburb 
the american institute of architects endorsed the copyright 
offices view that federal law needs to be made more clearly 
consistent with the berne convention the world copyright treaty 
which the united states joined on march l 
under that treaty virtually every other signatory nation 
guarantees copyright protection to works of architecture but 
legislation passed by congress last year providing for us 
adherence to the treaty failed to provide similar guarantees for 
american architects instead the us copyright office was asked to 
study the issue and make recommendations 
the copyright office report did not recommend specific action but 
outlined several options one would be to amend federal law to 
exclude unique architectural structures from the useful article 
exemption thus allowing copyright protection for certain 
exceptional buildings but not for instance tract housing 
the aia said current law has proved only partially effective in 
helping resolve an increasing number of lawsuits challenging

a senior official said monday britain will have 
trouble governing hong kong if it does not calm anxieties over the 
colonys reversion to chinese rule in 1997 by giving people here the 
right to live in britain 
lydia dunn a member of the executive council cabinet spoke 
before she left to try to persuade london to change its mind on the 
issue she and allen lee of the legislative council will meet with 
prime minister margaret thatcher foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe and members of parliament 
mrs thatcher told hong kong gov david wilson in talks this 
month that giving right of residence to the 325 million british 
passport holders in hong kong was politically impossible british 
news reports said up to 250000 people may be accepted mostly 
current and retired civil servants 
hong kongs 55 million people have been alarmed about their fate 
when china regains control over the island when britains lease 
expires in 1997 they intensified demands for right of resettlement 
after the june 34 bloodshed in beijing and chinas crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement through mass arrests and intimidation 
hong kong natives are entitled to british passports but the 
passports do not allow them to live in britain 
without the commitment of the people and their confidence in 
staying here investing here or working here then hong kong becomes 
vulnerable this is the case we will be presenting mrs dunn 
told a news conference 
i would say it would be very difficult for the british 
administration to run this place a population who are not only 
anxious about the future but resentful of being deprived of the one 
thing which would give them an assurance and which is entirely in 
the power of the british government she said 
she said britain need not fear a mass influx 
what were trying to impress on people is that people do 
not wish to leave hong kong this is our home 
to stay our anxieties must be allayed our anxieties can only 
be allayed if there is an assurance that there is a right of abode 
in britain if things do not work out 
she said britain had a moral obligation and a constitutional 
responsibility to grant this 
a large majority of hong kong people responding to recent polls 
believe britain should give the passport holders the right of 
resettlement the inrasia pacific ltd polling organization said

a moslem group seeking to prosecute writer salman 
rushdie won the right on monday to challenge a court ruling that 
britains blasphemy laws apply only to christianity 
the moslem action group which represents moslems throughout 
britain wants to bring rushdie and viking penguin publishers to 
trial under blasphemy laws for his novel the satanic verses 
we will now seek to show that any religion including islam 
can be included in the offense of blasphemy said ali azhar a 
lawyer for moslem action 
many moslems believe the book blasphemes islam but rushdie 
maintains it does not the british author born of moslem parents in 
india has been in hiding since feb 14 when the late iranian 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini decreed he should die because of 
his book 
high court justice michael nolan granted abdal choudhury a 
spokesman for moslem action permission to challenge the bow street 
magistrates courts refusal to issue summonses on the grounds that 
the laws of blasphemy applied only to christians 
nolan decided a full hearing should be by three high court 
judges no date was set 
david pannick lawyer for viking penguin opposed the application 
for high court review of the magistrates decision rushdie was not 
personally represented in court 
azhar said moslem action now will be seeking the whereabouts of 
rushdie to serve him with legal documents lawyers might request the 
courts help in locating rushdie he said 
nolan said an application for assistance could be made but he 
did not indicate what form of aid could be granted or whether 
rushdies whereabouts would have to be revealed 
antirushdie demonstrators cheered at a prayer meeting outside 
londons law courts after the justices ruling 
supporters waved photographs of khomeini and banners proclaiming 
criminal must be brought to justice and satan rushdie must be 
punished 
violent demonstrations have been held in several countries 
including britain and 19 people died in antirushdie rioting in 
india and pakistan in february

a production dispute has forced the federal 
aviation administration to put on hold its plan for bringing a new 
generation of landing systems to the nations airports 
the faa installed its first microwave landing system at lebanon 
airport in a highly publicized ceremony april 6 and the laconia and 
manchester airports were scheduled to get the stateoftheart 
system by late summer 
however earlier this month the faa took a step toward 
terminating its contract with hazeltine corp its prime contractor 
for the system faa spokesman john leyden said late last week 
as the agency looks to other electronics firms for the new 
technology it must sell the new system to reluctant air carriers 
who say it isnt much better than the instrument landing system now 
in use 
leyden said the faa remains committed to an international 
agreement to make the microwave system standard at airports 
worldwide by 1998 and has not changed plans to equip all us 
airports with the new system by the year 2000 
the system which uses highfrequency microwaves to direct planes 
to landings is virtually immune to weather it allows planes to 
make curved and steeper approaches which increases an airports 
flight capacity and helps planes avoid residential areas 
the faa contracted with hazeltine in 1984 for 178 systems at 79 
million but the commack nybased firm said the price was too 
low and entered an unauthorized workslowdown last august said 
dick arnold head of the faas microwave landing system program 
after nearly six months of fruitless negotiations the faa on 
june 2 sent hazeltine a letter saying the companys actions could 
lead to termination of the contract hazeltine has until thursday to 
respond 
hazeltine officials were phoned for comment but refused to say 
anything about the issue 
leyden said cancelling the hazeltine contract wont mean 
scrapping the faas installation program he said the agency plans 
to buy 26 systems from other sources 
but the cancellation will lead to further delays in the 
installation program jerry casavant the faas associate program 
director for the microwave landing system in new england said it 
already was at least 3 years behind the original schedule 
leyden said that with installations at laconia and manchester put 
on hold the faa is considering redirecting early installations to 
more highprofile highvolume airports such as kennedy 
international in new york city 
the three new hampshire airports would have been part of the 
first phase of planned us installations which included bostons 
logan airport and kennedy international 
the idea was to equip an entire hubandspoke network so that the 
airlines that serve those airports would see the benefit of 
equipping their planes with the expensive receiving systems 
the second phase of the faas plan if approved by congress is 
for 750 systems that would mean complete replacement of the more 
than 700 instrument landing systems in use in the nations airports 
as well as installation of microwave systems at sites unsuitable for 
the old system 
the programs delays have dampened much of the initial enthusiasm 
among carriers casavant said 
thats due partly to improvements in the instrument landing 
system since the microwave system was first introduced the 
improvements make the instrument system less expensive and more 
sophisticated which makes the switch to the new system less 
imperative state aeronautics director harold buker said

private employers cannot unilaterally begin 
testing union workers for drug and alcohol use but can test job 
applicants regardless of whether unions object the national labor 
relations board said monday in its first decisions on the 
controversial issue 
the board however said that if employers test applicants for 
drug and alcohol use they cannot deny unions information about those 
who are offered jobs but do not accept them including those who 
refuse to submit to tests 
in rejecting attempts by employers to unlilaterally implement 
drug and alcohol testing of current workers represented by unions 
the board said testing is an issue that falls under collective 
bargaining and therefore must be the subject of unionmanagement 
negotiations 
but the board said there is no such protection for job applicants 
and said employers do not need to negotiate with their unions if 
they want to subject applicants to drug and alcohol testing 
that decision long awaited by employers and business groups 
could result in a proliferation of applicanttesting policies 
attorneys familiar with labor law said monday 
the precedentsetting nlrb decisions came the same day the 
supreme court ruled that railroads may require tests for workers 
without bargaining with unions over the issue railway and airline 
workers are covered under the railway labor act not the national 
labor relations act that the nlrb is empowered to enforce 
attorneys and union officials familiar with drug testing cases 
said the supreme court decisions would have limited impact outside 
the rail and airline industries where drug testing is common 
particularly in positions with direct impact on public safety but 
they predicted the issues in the cases decided by the nlrb on monday 
could ultimately end up before the high court 
in the first case involving the johnsonbateman co of etiwanda 
calif the nlrb said the company violated its collective bargaining 
agreement with the machinists union when it in december 1986 
informed employees that it would require drug and alcohol tests for 
any employee injured at work 
we conclude that drug and alcohol testing of employees who 
require treatment for injuries received while on the job is a 
mandatory subject of bargaining the board said 
the board ordered the company to negotiate with the union if it 
wanted to adopt such a testing policy for its unionrepresented 
production and maintenance employees 
attempts to reach company officials for comment were not 
immediately successful a receptionist said none of the company 
owners was in the office and the lawyer who represented the company 
also was not at his office monday afternoon 
in the second case the board reversed an administrative law 
judges decision that preemployment drug and alcohol testing by the 
star tribune of minneapolis was an issue the newspaper needed to 
negotiate with its union 
we find that drug and alcohol testing of applicants for 
employment is not a mandatory subject of bargaining the board 
said 
john dennison the newspapers vice president for labor 
relations said the star tribune was gratified by the decision 
dennison said the newspaper has received numerous inquiries about 
the status of its case and speculated that people who had been 
taking a sit back and wait approach may now go ahead with 
applicanttesting policies 
the board did say the newspaper violated the national labor 
relations act by refusing to furnish the union with the requested 
information relating to the drug and alcohol testing of prospective 
employees 
the board said the union the newspaper guild was entitled to 
the information to monitor star tribune hiring practices for any 
signs of discrimination 
the union as part of its challenge of the policy said male 
applicants were allowed to provide urine samples without being 
observed while female applicants were required to give the samples 
partially unclothed and in the presence of a nurse 
the nlrb ordered the newspaper to provide the guild with the 
names addresses and telephone numbers of all applicants to which it 
conditionally offered employment in guildrepresented positions 
since january 1987 and to identify all those in that group who 
refused to submit to drug and alcohol screening 
the nlrb adopting reasonining similar to its decision in the 
johnsonbatemen case upheld the judges 1988 ruling that the 
newspaper violated its collective bargaining agreement with the 
guild by trying to unilaterally implement a drug testing policy for 
current workers in january 1987 
dennison said the newspaper had not enforced the policy and that 
the issue was the subject of current negotiations with the guild

premier li peng said monday that none of the 
nations criticizing chinas suppression of dissidents would have 
shown as much restraint and he honored as martyrs three soldiers 
killed in the crackdown 
for more than 50 days our government army and party were 
restrained li told the families of the dead soldiers at communist 
party headquarters apparently referring to the weeks preceding the 
june 34 crackdown 
some countries have attacked us abused us and created 
rumors he said can their governments be so tolerant you wont 
find one that is 
since troops attacked central beijing to crush seven weeks of 
protests more than 1000 people have been arrested and at least 11 
have been sentenced to death 
western intelligence sources and chinese witnesses say up to 
3000 people were killed in the crackdown the government says fewer 
than 300 died half of them soldiers 
since declaring martial law may 20 in beijing li has emerged as 
the chief spokesman for the governments hardline position against 
the studentled movement for greater freedoms and an end to 
government corruption 
meanwhile a special session of the national legislature headed 
by a more moderate official was postponed 
wan li the chairman of the national peoples congress had 
scheduled a congress session beginning tuesday to discuss issues 
of peoples common concern and prompt the government to improve its 
work 
wan who has a reputation as a moderate called the session 
before the june 34 crackdown some students had hoped it would 
approve some of the democratic reforms they were demanding 
but the congresss press office said the session was postponed 
because beijing had not yet returned completely to normal no new 
date was set 
the legislature may be waiting until the communist party holds an 
anticipated central committee meeting to formally oust party general 
secretary zhao ziyang zhao reportedly already has been stripped of 
his power for opposing the crackdown 
he and party propaganda chief hu qili are the only top officials 
believed purged wan has supported the crackdown publicly 
the government announced it was expelling the sixth foreign 
reporter in the past 10 days the official xinhua news agency said

us embassy said he was stopped by police last week after 
interviewing people outside beijing an area not under martial law 
kahn could not be reached for comment china already has expelled 
two american reporters based in beijing and three british reporters 
visiting china and reporting on the crackdown 
a canadian reporter said three men in plain clothes apparently 
police grabbed her late monday and tried to shove her into an 
unmarked car but that she broke free and the car left when a crowd 
gathered jan wong of the toronto globe and mail said the men said 
they wanted to talk with her 
chinese authorities briefly detained a cbs news crew of four 
people early tuesday said cbs spokesman tom goodman in new york he 
said the four were driving near tiananmen square when police stopped 
them and ordered them to follow a police car to the forbidden city 
the old imperial palace compound he said they were released about 
two hours later 
the government has harshly criticized foreign reporting of the 
bloody crackdown and accused reporters of rumormongering under 
martial law regulations most interviewing is banned but many 
reporters have ignored the regulations 
more than 46 additional arrests in connection with the protests 
were announced monday most workers who joined or helped lead 
independent unions the arrests brought the total reported to more 
than 1360 
about 30 chinese trying to get visas to leave the country spent 
the night outside the us embassy some for the second straight 
night several hundred slept outside the canadian embassy the night 
before to get a good place in line the chinese government has 
tightened emigration restrictions requiring people who already have 
obtained exit permits to get a second one 
more memorials were held in beijing and other cities for soldiers 
killed in the june 34 battle with crowds that used stones 
firebombs and their own bodies to try to stop tanks from entering 
tiananmen square where protesters were camped

shrines of flowers and banners at the sites where they died 
president yang shangkun met with their relatives sunday and li and 
other top officials did monday 
for the second straight day more than 100 army trucks many 
jammed with soldiers drove east from the city center the troops 
apparently were among those that had been billeted inside the walled 
compounds around tiananmen square 
although the troop presence on the streets was sharply reduced by 
day soldiers still set up checkpoints at night where they stopped 
and searched cars and checked identification papers 
western diplomats said most of the estimated 150000 soldiers who 
were called into beijing to enforce martial law have been moved from 
downtown to the city outskirts

the state senate acted monday to stem 
accidental shootings that have killed or wounded seven children this 
month passing a bill that could imprison gun owners who dont 
secure their weapons 
the bill approved 324 in a special session sets a maximum 
penalty of five years in prison and a 5000 fine for adult 
violators 
but the measure sponsored by republican sen john grant was 
weakened by amendments that lowered the age of a minor from 18 to 16 
and exempted guns kept in automobiles and unloaded firearms 
we think by highlighting the responsibility to keep a loaded 
gun away from children were going to save a lot of lives gov 
bob martinez said before the senate acted 
the legislature felt it needed to do something so that you 
folks would shut up national rifle association spokeswoman marion 
hammer told reporters after the senate vote 
the shootings this month led martinez to include gun safety in a 
special session of the legislature which was originally called 
mainly to debate a turnpike building plan 
hammer whose organization has blocked efforts to toughen 
floridas liberal gun laws in recent years called the senate bill 
phony unreal and a disservice to the people of florida but 
said the nra was satisfied with it 
in the house seven gun safety bills were filed for 
consideration and three of those were assigned to committee 
hearings scheduled for tuesday 
one of the three measures could result in a fiveyear prison term 
if a child is killed or maimed by an unattended weapon 
the bill by republican rep harry jennings would also make it a 
misdemeanor to leave a firearm accessible to a child 
the measure passed in the house during the recently completed 
regular session but the senate didnt take it up making it 
necessary for the bill to be reconsidered 
a second measure by democratic rep susan guber would punish 
anyone selling or furnishing a weapon to an unsupervised minor 
without parental permission and requires gun owners to keep their 
firearms locked and unloaded it exempts stolen guns 
the third measure by democratic rep brian rush would require 
gun stores to post signs warning gun owners about leaving loaded 
weapons within reach of children 
to become law a bill must be passed by both the house and the 
senate then be signed by the governor 
the session followed the death saturday night of 4yearold 
silvio claud pierre at tampa general hospital where he had been in 
critical condition after shooting himself at his home june 11 
silvio found a handgun under a couch while his mother was in the 
shower his father was out 
five days earlier a 10yearold orlando boy was killed by a 
playmate six days earlier an 8yearold miramar girl was killed by 
her 10yearold brother who thought his fathers gun was unloaded 
four children ranging in age from 4 to 16 were wounded in 
separate accidental shootings this month

a giant spot roughly 6200 miles wide has 
been discovered on the planet neptune by the voyager 2 space probe 
and scientists said monday it looks like a storm similar to the 
great red spot on jupiter 
its huge said physicist edward stone voyager project 
scientist for nasa and a vice president of the california institute 
of technology it would be reasonable to suspect this is a large 
hurricanelike storm system similar to the great red spot 
however stone said voyager 2 still is too far from neptune to 
determine if winds are swirling within the gargantuan spot which 
measures about 6200 miles in diameter jupiters great red spot 
contains 250 mph winds 
scientists havent yet named neptunes spot but are calling it 
the dark spot because it appears darker than the surrounding 
bluegreenish atmosphere he added 
the color of the spot isnt yet known because scientists havent 
processed a complete set of pictures through different color 
filters said andrew ingersoll a caltech planetary scientist 
voyager 2 is hurtling at more than 42000 mph toward its aug 24 
close encounter with neptune at that time the hardy spacecraft 
will zip within 3000 miles of the gaseous planets cloud tops by 
far the closest of any of voyagers planetary flybys five hours 
later it will fly within 25000 miles of triton one of neptunes 
two known moons 
by tuesday voyager 2 will be nearly 266 billion miles from 
earth and 5898 million miles from neptune traveling at a speed of 
42216 mph said mary beth murrill a spokeswoman for the national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
the neptune encounter will be voyager 2s fourth and final 
planetary flyby since the probe was launched from cape canaveral in 
1977 it explored jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
neptunes dark spot is located at about 25 to 30 degrees latitude 
in the planets southern hemisphere ingersoll said adding that 
voyager also discovered a much smaller rapidly changing white spot 
about half the size of the dark spot at about 70 degrees south 
latitude 
stone said neptunes dark spot first was clearly recognized in 
still photographs taken by voyager 2s television cameras in april 
and can be seen faintly in pictures taken as early as january 
it isnt as large as jupiters great red spot which is 16000 
miles across at its widest point large enough to contain three 
earths but the dark spot is just as large relative to neptune 
about a fifth of the planets diameter as the great red spot is 
relative to jupiter 
jupiters great red spot was discovered more than 350 years ago 
ingersoll said it is believed to be red because of organic 
chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within it 
besides the great red spot jupiter also contains dozens of 
smaller storm systems which appear as white spots and saturn also 
has similar storms although they are less visible stone said 
the major mystery of jupiters great red spot is how the storm 
has remained intact for centuries while earths hurricanes break up 
after a week or two ingersoll said 
the absence of continents on giant gas planets like jupiter and 
neptune may explain the persistence of the spots he said adding 
that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on earth 
computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant 
storms such as the red spot and neptunes dark spot stone and 
ingersoll said 
neptune is the solar systems fourth largest planet and usually 
is the eighth planet from the sun but because plutos elongated 
elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun neptune 
currently is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun

the united states proposed monday that free 
elections be adopted by all 35 member nations of the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe 
by introducing this proposal we are setting down a marker we 
are establishing a goal which we believe should be pursued 
vigorously said congressman steny h hoyer dmd cochairman of 
the us commission on security and cooperation in europe 
he said the proposal challenges those participating states who 
do not yet permit free elections to give their citizens the right to 
freely participate in their own government 
he spoke at the monthlong conference on the human dimension 
which closes friday 
over the past three weeks the delegations meeting mainly in 
closed sessions have been calling to account nations accused of 
human rights violations romania and bulgaria have been frequent 
targets 
the fingerpointing technique is part of a process agreed to at a 
meeting in january in vienna of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
the united states and canada and all european countries except 
albania are members of csce 
the us proposal also calls for allowing citizens to establish 
political parties and organizations permitting individuals to seek 
positions of public service and having elections observed by outside 
governments institutions or organizations 
the yearning for democracy throughout the world is a fact 
that is unstoppable hoyer told a news conference 
he acknowledged that obtaining the needed consensus to adopt the 
proposal was unlikely tomorrow but said we believe that the 
winds of change for democracy are very very powerful 
morris b abram head of the us delegation said that in the 
united states the flow of moral authority is from the people up 
and with the freeelection proposal we are demonstrating that the 
crux of the whole human rights movement rests on that principle 
the paris conference is the first of three csce human rights 
meeting to be held in line with the 1975 helsinki accords next 
years conference is to be in copenhagen and the third is scheduled 
for moscow in 1991

irancontra prosecutors monday asked the judge 
to sentence oliver north to prison arguing that the former 
presidential aide lied at his trial shows no remorse and sees 
himself as above the law and beyond reproach 
in a memo filed four days before norths sentencing prosecutors 
urged us district judge gerhard a gesell to consider norths 
breach of public trust and misuse of public power the destructive 
effect of his criminal behavior on the functioning of government 
his perjury and his total lack of remorse 
a prison term would also help counteract the political appeal 
that north has gained on the lecture circuit a popularity that 
prosecutors argued only reinforces his lack of remorse 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh charged that with supreme 
faith in his ability to deceive north took the witness stand and 
perjured himself with a false story to explain away a charge that 
he pocketed 4300 in travelers checks entrusted to him by a leader 
of the nicaraguan rebels 
his unsupported claim that he had a 15000 fund in a steel box 
in his closet echoed the flimsy lies offered by corrupt municipal 
officials in the days of tammany hall walsh said 
norths attempt to use the steel box to explain his cash 
purchase of a car in two installments graphically demonstrates 
norths penchant for weaving a tale that by its conclusion is 
preposterous 
the retired marine lieutenant colonel faces a possible 10year 
sentence for aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress 
destroying or mutilating government documents and accepting an 
illegal gratuity a 13800 security system outside his home that 
was paid for by arms dealer richard v secord 
north 45 was acquitted of nine other counts including a charge 
he stole the travelers checks 
walsh did not make a specific recommendation of how many months 
or years north should serve in prison 
norths perjury represents another indication of his continuing 
callous attitude toward the judicial process and our democratic 
institutions walsh said 
despite this accusation walsh delivered an 11thhour invitation 
to north to cooperate with his investigation and testify against 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and other 
irancontra defendants 
the investigation of this office is not yet concluded despite 
his dimninished credibility north would still have a usefulness as 
a witness if he were prepared to take the steps appropriate to such 
a course walsh wrote 
norths lawyer brendan v sullivan jr has not yet submitted a 
sentencing memorandum of his own but is likely to do so soon 
throughout the 12page sentencing memorandum walsh repeated the 
theme that north has not indicated one iota of remorse for crimes 
which because of his position of public trust jeopardized the 
constitutional processes of government 
the arrogance that characterized norths exercise of power 
before the investigation has been the hallmark of his reaction to 
his indictment and conviction walsh said noting norths comment 
after the may 4 verdict that his vindication was not complete 
oliver north viewed and continues to view himself as being 
above the law and beyond reproach walsh said 
walsh noted that during his testimony north said that not for 
one fleeting moment did he think he was doing anything wrong by 
helping prepare a false chronology of usiran arms sales to show 
congressional investigators 
certainly he sees nothing wrong with lying to congress when 
in view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary the 
independent counsel said 
walsh said the retired marine lieutenant colonels lack of 
remorse is particularly troubling in view of the fact that he 
continues to travel throughout the country like a politician on the 
stump giving speeches and discoursing on his defiance of 
congress walsh said 
the fact that this defendant is cultivating a popular 
following which reinforces his lack of remorse makes it all the 
more important for the court to underscore the gravity of norths 
offenses by imposing a term of incarceration said walsh 
the independent prosecutor also rejected the notion that north is 
a scapegoat 
he is a government official who must be held to account for the 
legality and honesty of his own personal actions regardless of 
whether others may also have transgressed the law and regardless of 
the ends sought to be achieved walsh said 
walsh also disputed norths suggestion at the trial that he was 
acting with the authorization of higher officials in the reagan 
administration 
this society cannot tolerate government officials unwilling and 
unable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility in 
refusing to perform illegal acts walsh said the sentence should 
show that one cannot simply rely on real or imagined authorization 
of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility walsh said 
norths acceptance of the 13800 security system from secord an 
irancontra codefendant awaiting trial shows venality in 
financial matters 
letting north go free without imprisonment would send exactly 
the wrong message to government officials and to the public walsh 
said it would be a statement that 15 years after watergate 
government officials can participate in a brazen coverup lie to 
congress and collect a substantial gratuity and still receive only a 
slap on the wrist

a school board voted unanimously 
monday night to appeal a circuit judges ruling that it improperly 
dismissed a veteran math teacher who refused to wear a tie to class 
all five mason county school board members voted to appeal the 
decision objecting to the firing of bill webb a 46yearold math 
teacher from gallipolis ohio to the west virginia supreme court 
im not upset that it will be appealed webb said before the 
board vote 
ive felt from the beginning that what they did was wrong 
said webb whose typical school clothes consisted of the blue jeans 
and flannel shirts he wears while operating his gallia county ohio 
farm and body shop across the river from point pleasant 
after the meeting board president emma kearns said the panel 
made short shrift of the appeal because board members were unanimous 
in firing webb last december 
she referred further questions to board attorney diane johnson 
who had discussed the circuit court decision with board members at a 
hearing last week 
i told them of the courts decision and my recommendation was 
to appeal johnson said 
superintendent charles chambers imposed a new dress code last 
summer after teachers had signed work contracts for the new school 
year and suspended webb three times when the 19year teacher 
refused to comply with its orders to wear a tie and dress pants 
webb was fired dec 19 on a charge of gross insubordination 
webb appealed his firing and earlier suspensions on june 7 
circuit judge charlie king ruled webb had the right to disobey the 
dress code developed by the superintendent because the latter had no 
right to develop a code separate from the board 
king also ordered the board to give webb 11 days back pay and 
pay 1000 in legal fees 
after the legality of chambers code came into question the 
board adopted a policy that made ties optional but still banned 
teachers from wearing denim or blue jeans 
board members however maintain that webb still deserved to 
fired for insubordination 
board attorney johnson had previously notified the west virginia 
supreme court of its intent to appeal but formal board action was 
required 
webb said monday he didnt expect to return to the mason county 
school system for that and other reasons 
i cant see going back with the hard feelings that are there 
webb said ive had friends that ive known for 20 years that 
dont talk to me anymore 
people see me coming and they walk right past me i dont need 
that in my life

socialist and environmentalist 
candidates in several nations and extreme rightists in west germany 
were the major winners in elections for the 12nation european

most american middle schools are too large and 
impersonal to meet adolescents intellectual and emotional needs 
and the result for many students may be a life on the edge of 
society according to a new report 
middle grade schools could be a strong positive influence on 
adolescents as they face a world in which they are tempted to 
experiment with alcohol sex and drugs according to the report by a 
task force of the carnegie council on adolescent development 
instead many large middle grade schools function as mills that 
contain and process endless streams of students within them are 
masses of anonymous youth said the study such settings 
virtually guarantee that the intellectual and emotional needs of 
youth will go unmet 
the report titled turning points preparing american youth for 
the 21st century was released sunday on the first day of a 
threeday meeting sponsored by the carnegie corp of new york to

president bushs education policy bush has questioned whether 
greater spending is needed 
after a decade in which the backtobasics movement swept the

a cluster of thatched huts and watermills 
sits beside a stream in central japan amid watery fields of green 
mustard mirroring snowcapped peaks akira kurosawas legendary 
insistence on perfection is evident 
it is the set of village of the watermills a sequence in the 
awardwinning filmmakers latest movie dreams and the scene 
depicts one of his most pleasant visions 
kurosawa has spent 46 years using his genius as a film director 
editor and writer to create painfully realistic portrayals of human 
nature in dreams he bares his vivid imagination to reach 
modern japanese audiences in a way he hasnt for decades 
the feelings which lie sleeping in our hearts the secret hopes 
which we keep hidden deep inside and the dark wishes and fears 
manifest themselves honestly in our dreams says the 79yearold 
director 
dreams is a series of nine episodes kurosawa has envisioned 
in his lifetime ranging from life in an idyllic village to a 
terrifying nightmare of nuclear holocaust images likely to move 
japanese viewers in a more personal way than some of the directors 
other recent films 
kurosawas 1980 epic war film kagemusha won top honors at 
the cannes film festival and several of his other movies have won 
international critical acclaim since the mid1960s however those 
films with their uncompromising intellectual complexity and somber 
tone have been spurned by the japanese film industry which tends 
to favor cute animal stories and gangster films 
after dodeskaden flopped in 1970 kurosawa went through a 
period of ill health and depression that culminated in a suicide 
attempt in 1971 his next movie dersu uzala in 1975 was 
produced and financed in the soviet union ever since kurosawa has 
financed his movies outside japan dreams is no exception 
steven spielbergs amblin entertainment in cooperation with 
george lucas industrial light and magiclucas co are supplying 
approximately 107 million in production costs for dreams 
warner bros will distribute the film in the united states where 
it is tentatively scheduled for a christmas release 
kurosawa is notorious for his volatile temper he was godhumored 
and patient however as he relaxed in the warm may sunshine after a 
days shooting on the set of village of the watermills 
large blue and green reflectors are shifted to and fro to capture 
the sunlight men in wetsuits splash through a stream swollen by 
melting snow arranging water plants and snagging trash before it 
floats by other crew members scramble up and down banks organizing 
the foliage just so 
finally the sun breaks out of the clouds 
start assistant director takashi koizumi shouts 
a gaily costumed funeral procession dances along the treelined 
path beside the stream accompanied by musicians playing drums 
flutes and cymbals 
cut says kurosawa one more time 
jeansclad akira terao who plays kurosawa in all but two of the 
dreams stands patiently as scattered flower petals are collected 
and dancers return to position a crane lifts a tree branch higher 
out of the way 
well do the real shooting now kurosawa says 
as terao who has wandered into a strange village watches the 
procession an elderly man in a straw hat and orange apron played 
by chishu ryu explains that the villagers are celebrating rather 
than mourning the death of a 99yearold woman who has led a 
fulfilling life 
something strange floated down the river do it again 
kurosawa shouts 
kurosawa began his career in 1943 amid censorship and economic 
limitations imposed by world war ii in his memoirs he says he 
learned to thrive under restrictions from deadlines and budgets 
which forced him to develop new techniques 
to film quickly and effectively he began the innovative use of 
two or more cameras on every set here there are two on platforms 
one in a tree and one above a mustard field 
kurosawas actors rehearse repeatedly until he feels they are 
cameraready 
the director edits his films as they are shot and shows them to 
his staff only after the first cuts are made he mastered most of 
the skills of filmmaking including scriptwriting and set design 
and exercises almost total control says producer yoshio inoue 
long hours in the darkroom have made kurosawas eyes sensitive to 
light obliging him to wear his trademark sunglasses and cap 
kurosawa walks slowly and his hands shake ever so slightly as he 
lights a cigarette but he remains tall and hearty clad in 
sneakers faded jeans and a bluestriped shirt 
he balks at discussing his films saying they should speak for 
themselves but the idea behind dreams is clear human hearts 
have been lost along with nature i am nostalgic for a good 
environment and good hearts 
this is a beautiful spot a very gorgeous river but we had to 
look all over japan to find a river like this thats how much 
nature is lost he says its really sad 
in other vignettes the movie depicts dreams of fairy tales a 
blizzard a dark tunnel of madness he imagines stepping into a 
painting of vincent van gogh played by martin scorsese and meeting 
the artist himself 
he left out one puzzling dream about a hippopatamus walking 
through a sliding door he says 
the most terrifying nightmare perhaps is mount fuji in red 
showing the dreamer stranded in hellish confusion as the great 
volcano melts down after a nuclear plant explosion 
with assistance from george lucas production company kurosawa 
will use special effects for the first time in the mount fuji 
sequence 
in dreams kurosawa once again shares his philosophy of 
humanism described by friend and translator audie bock as the 
belief that man must fight to retain hope in the midst of this 
hopeless world and in this fight all men are brothers 
kurosawas most wonderful dream shows television announcers 
shouting that world peace has finally come 
despite its foreign funding and universal themes dreams is 
directed mainly at japan 
id like to fix japan he says 
the government is despicable he says and the japanese film 
industry is only concerned with making money 
the movie business is in terrible shape directors only make 
what they think will sell they need to come up with good films that 
people will love he says 
kurosawa already has an idea for his next film but wont discuss 
it 
someone might steal it he says if its good thats ok 
but i usually wouldnt like the results 
i hope to stay healthy and keep working up to 103 years old 
its really fun i really enjoy doing this all films are dreams for 
a director

there are only two more weeks of shooting on federico 
fellinis movie and he is still not sure what its about 
its different from my other films he says sitting in a 
dark cavernous studio and frowning into space it doesnt have a 
story 
some people fellini for example might say fellini films 
never have a story or if there is one he isnt going to tell you 
the director of la strada 8 and amarcord says his 
new film deals with the countryside with reality with the lunacies 
in contemporary society it began with just a glimmer i didnt 
know i still dont know what this film is 
la voce della luna the voice of the moon is the 24th 
movie by the legendary italian director who captured the soul of 
italy in the early 1960s in la dolce vita and led filmmaking 
into a new world of fantasy 
he is now 69 whitehaired but still bearlike his eyes gazing 
intensely from a big jowly head his husky frame dominating the set 
it has been very tiring he says lowering himself into a 
canvas chair not only working without a script but without a 
subject too 
the ideas behind the film had been brewing in his mind for a long 
time a tale about the don quixotes of the world about the tyl 
ulenspiegls you americans ought to read something sometime he 
advises someone unfamiliar with the happygolucky flemish folk 
hero 
the catalyst came when he bought the novel il poema dei 
lunatici the poem of the lunatics by ermanno cavazzoni 
i immediately forgot it in a taxi he recalls in three or 
four days the taxi driver sent it to me with a note he said i 
started to read this and i didnt understand a thing 
so i thought i had to read it 
the novel tells of savini a man who hears voices from wells and 
a village prefect who together travel the countryside meeting a 
fantastic assortment of animals and historical figures savini 
personifies the creative side of lunacy the prefect the 
bureaucratic 
it the book communicated to me something very lovely people 
in a real situation which was at the same time transparent and 
through it you could see another and another reality fellini 
said it was a game of transparencies 
however he took only vibrations from the book 
as for the rest of the inspiration there was reggiolo the town 
he created at romes pontini studios and that appears to have 
existed in his mind for some time it is a contemporary italian 
town fellinistyle with an ancient brick tower under restoration 
a supermodern glass church and a gallery of stores selling lace 
panties computers and hand grenades 
after the village was finished i needed inhabitants and 
gradually the inhabitants arrived says fellini his eyes 
narrowing behind his blackrimmed glasses as he gazes into his 
fantasy world 
as he imagined more and more people to go with the village the 
imaginary townspeople began to suggest ideas for the film 
i have been listening to the townspeople he states 
matteroffactly 
he is not sure how it will end but for that matter he is not 
sure how it has been going all along 
its about the countryside the real one that i remember from 
my childhood and a fantastic one that i tried to put in some 
films la strada amarcord films with more of a narrative 
structure 
this gave me the chance to leave that it liberated me more 
from stories psychologies situations conclusions 
true to his usual pattern fellini still has to make up the 
dialogue for the film it will be dubbed in in the months ahead as 
he cuts and edits the movie produced by mario and vittorio cecchi 
gori at a cost of about 14 million is due out in october 
fellini is working with several old collaborators including 
tullio pinelli who helped create the stories and screenplays of 
la strada and la dolce vita and dante ferretti who 
designed the sets for city of women and ginger and fred 
but there are many new faces chiefly the principal actors 
roberto benigni and paolo villaggio two of italys top comic 
artists benigni is known outside italy for playing the immigrant in 
jim jarmuschs down by law 
despite the presence of the comedians fellini says the film is 
not simply comedy it is not autobiography it is not about 
insanity as such 
it doesnt seem like any of my other films he shrugs happily

vietnam cambodia and laos are beckoning 
foreign tourists to their temples beaches and battlefields in hopes 
of accumulating dollars and other hard currencies to strengthen 
their ailing economies 
recent reforms have greatly loosened travel to and within the 
three communistgoverned nations long sealed off by wars and 
suspicious officialdom 
some us war veterans have returned to vietnam in recent years 
to visit battlefields where they fought the viet cong and north 
vietnamese and vietnam would like to see more of the 27 million 
who served return but us sanctions might prevent that 
west europeans are going to angkor cambodias ancient capital 
and tour groups are flying to the former royal capital of luang 
prabang in laos 
the potential is tremendous said hp tuggener who operates 
a travel agency in bangkok thailand the demand will be far 
greater than they can absorb in the next few years its been closed 
for so long there are thousands just waiting to get in 
tuggener who has been involved in indochina tourism for several 
decades said in bangkok that shortages of hotels aircraft tour 
guides and other services will hold back largescale tourism hanoi 
for example currently has 671 hotel beds compared to 24000 in hong 
kong and 25600 in bangkok thailands capital 
our policy now is to be more open to receive more guests 
said tourism official nguyen cuong hien but i can tell you 
vietnam as a tourist destination is virgin land 
vietnam and cambodia come under the us trading with the enemy 
act which means americans can go to those two countries but cannot 
spend money there the intent is to keep us dollars from flowing 
into the economies of countries still considered enemies laos is 
not affected since the united states never broke relations with it 
the us treasury department last year also made it illegal for 
americans to arrange promote or facilitate group or individual 
tours or travel to any country listed under the trading with the 
enemy act others on the list are cuba and north korea 
under its new regulations the treasury department has said it 
intended to prosecute two veterans donald mills and john myers of 
akron ohio members of the vietnam veterans of america who have 
organized six tours for veterans since 1984 in a program to heal 
old deep wounds the american civil liberties union maintains 
treasurys regulations violate the veterans first amendment rights 
and says it will defend them if they are prosecuted 
on june 14 a us federal court in bridgeport conn penalized 
lindblad travel inc of westport conn a total of 75000 for 
offering tours to vietnam and cambodia 
exempt from the us sanctions are journalists scholars or 
others who have a professional interest in the two countries 
in 1988 some 42000 travelers came to indochina in contrast to 
neighboring thailands 42 million but projections are all upward 
with vietnam expecting 100000 largely capitalist tourists by 
1990 compared with 40000 last year tourist visas which once took 
up to three months to get are generally in hand within a week 
among the poorest in the world the indochinese nations hope 
tourist income will help revive their economies hard currency fever 
is spreading rapidly 
dollars dollars chanted a taxi driver at hanoi airport 
unable to come up with any other english words at angkor cambodian 
officials are charging some of the highest entrance fees in the 
world 120 to get into two major temples transportation food and 
tourguide fees are extra 
vietnam hien said earned 57 million from tourism last year 
but it received about 60 applications from 17 countries for 
investment in the tourism sector 
hien said a west german company will build a 14story hotel in 
hanoi while a frenchindonesian group is set to overhaul the thong 
nhat an atmospheric but quickly fading relic of french colonial 
days others are eyeing vietnams often stunning 1860mile 
coastline and ho chi minh city the dynamic southern economic hub 
once called saigon 
hien who heads a department in the national tourism agency 
stressed that standards of service also had to be radically 
improved there are plans to send tourism employees to the west for 
training while the countrys foreign investment code allows foreign 
management of hotels 
cambodias top draw is angkor a complex of magnificent temples 
dating to the 9th century there are four other official tourist 
destinations but a continuing guerrilla war puts large areas of the 
country offlimits only 1500 tourists came last year but just a 
few years ago there were none 
with prospects for a peace settlement talks have been initiated 
for air links between phnom penh the capital and points like 
bangkok tokyo and hong kong phnom penhs hotels are being 
refurbished including the elegant cambodiana on the tonle sap 
river which is slated to have 200 of its 388 rooms ready by the end 
of the year 
although fewer than 600 tourists visited laos in the first six 
months of this year the easy overland access from thailand gives 
it a decided advantage 
travel agencies are offering group packages such as a sixday 
590aperson tour that includes stays in the capital vientiane 
and luang prabang a templestudded retreat nestled in a valley of 
the mekong river

ecologists and farmers in portugal and 
spain are at war against spreading eucalyptus trees the enemy is a 
paper pulp industry that encourages planting more and more of them 
eucalyptus plantations are sprouting up rapidly in the two 
countries as the industry seeks a secure supply of the raw material 
it will need to meet the demand for paper as the european economic 
community lowers trade barriers in 1992 
but farmers and ecologists claim eucalyptus trees drink up too 
much water from the soil endangering traditional olive trees 
chestnut trees and other nutbearing trees they also maintain the 
trees cause land erosion that kills off undergrowth vital to the 
survival of brown bears and other wildlife 
cellulose producers dispute claims the trees are harmful they 
say eucalyptus trees grow fast and are ideally suited to iberian 
soil and climate and that plantations will provide more export 
revenue and create jobs 
the arguments are passionate and tempers run high in march 
protestors in the portuguese town of valpacos clashed with police 
when farmers tried to rip up eucalyptus seedlings from a 396acre 
private plantation 
the region is portugals poorest 
we stopped them planting more eucalyptus at valpacos said 
olive grower joao silva if they try anywhere else well do 
the same again but worse 
if they want to plant eucalyptus they should plant where 
theres plenty water here we dont even have enough to drink 
environmentalists claim the eucalyptus first brought from 
australia in the late 1800s can turn fertile land into desert 
the eucalyptus consumes more water than almost any other tree 
and impedes other plants from growing nearby said santiago martin 
barajas vice president of the federation of spanish wildlife 
protection groups 
portugals interior already poor is being turned into a giant 
eucalyptus plantation and more people are moving toward the coast 
leaving villages deserted said serafim riem a spokesman for 
portuguese ecology group quercus 
the european economic community which faces a paper shortage 
imports 195 billion worth of wood annually 
timber and pulp command high prices and this encourages 
landowners to plant eucalyptus which can be 12 years about half 
the time of more traditional trees 
eucalyptus for us is green crude oil said luis mira amaral 
industry and energy minister for portugal where wood pulp paper 
and cellulose account for 8 percent of yearly export earnings 
spanish environmentalists fear the eec will subsidize massive 
eucalyptus plantings in northern spain where the mix of atlantic 
and mediterranean climates favors growth 
portuguese landowners already tap eec funds via the governments 
forestry action program paf while assistance to traditional tree 
planters is higher paf pays up to 30 percent of project costs for 
smallscale eucalyptus plantations 
portugal has no other vocation said eliseu baena forestry 
director at caima one of portugals big four cellulose producers 
if landowners want to restore their lands theyre going to do 
it with a profitable crop 
baena added that portugal doesnt make full use of its 104 
million acres of highgrade farmland so theres no reason not to 
use lowerquality land for cashcrops like eucalyptus 
he acknowledges that eucalyptus trees should be planted away from 
springs or rivers but refutes ecologists claims that they erode 
soil or kill off undergrowth vital to wildlife 
antonio navas deputy director of spains institute for wildlife 
preservation icona suggests the environmentalists might be poorly 
informed 
there hasnt been a clear debate he said the eucalyptus 
is blamed for causing diseases for being malignant 
said baena i think as much as half of portugals land could be 
forested and 30 percent of that could be planted with eucalyptus 
according to lisbons general directorate for forestry 
eucalyptus trees make up only 113 percent of portugals forests or 
about 4 percent of the countrys total land area of 35600 square 
miles 
but portugal is planting more eucalyptus than any other tree it 
accounts for 75 percent of all paf projects approved since may 
1988 or under consideration 
spain officially registers 495000 acres of eucalyptus but navas 
said the actual total is probably double that 
rui tadeu a teacherfarmer in trasosmontes in the valpacos 
region says landowners dont need eucalyptus to make money 
he produces nuts honey and port wine which bring a high return 
and plans to convert a derelict farm building into a hunting and 
tourist lodge 
the pulp producers promise more jobs from eucalyptus but most 
of the process is mechanized so the jobs are few and mainly in 
factories away from the country he said

the television western as rootless as a 
steelyeyed gunslinger has drifted back into town and there are 
two on the networks fall schedules the first time thats happened 
in 15 years 
cbs paradise starring lee horsley as a 1890s gunfighter who 
has to care for his late sisters four children is returning for a 
second season 
abc is adding a new show called the kid about the youngsters 
who rode for the pony express in the days before the railroads were 
completed coast to coast 
this past season the cbs miniseries lonesome dove proved that 
audiences will watch a wellmade drama even if its in western 
dress the eighthour miniseries based on the pulitzer 
prizewinning book by larry mcmurtry was the highestrated 
multipart movie of the 198889 season 
paradise is a family drama set against the background of the 
old west horsley plays ethan allen cord a fugitive gunslinger who 
inherits his dying sisters children she had sent them to him in 
the mistaken belief that he was the upstanding proprietor of a 
general store 
the kid attempts to blend the traditional western story with 
a youthful twist the way the movie young guns did the young 
pony express riders find themselves bound into a family because of 
the common jeopardy they face sounds like a western version of 21 
jump street 
the renewal of paradise is the first time a western series 
has been renewed by a network since kung fu an eastern 
western that ran on abc from 197275 
the networks havent had two western series on the air at the 
same time since 1974 when kung fu was on abc and gunsmoke 
was in its last season on cbs 
the western once as firm a television fixture as the sitcom 
dominated television in the 1950s 
gunsmoke as traditional as they come lasted for 20 years 
it was the highestrated show from 1957 to 1961 in 195859 the top 
of the nielsen ratings were dominated by westerns gunsmoke was 
no 1 wagon train was second have gun will travel third 
and the rifleman fourth others in the top 10 that year were 
maverick tales of wells fargo and the life and legend of 
wyatt earp 
nbcs wagon train another traditional western was the most 
popular show in 196162 nbcs bonanza somewhat less 
traditional was no 1 from 1964 to 67 gunsmoke remained 
popular until the end of its run but since then no western series 
has attracted a large audience 
the western didnt back down without a fight since the decline 
of the western series in the early 1970s the networks have tried at 
least nine shows even more if you expand the genre to include such 
frontier shows as young danl boone father murphy and 
the new land or the contemporary westernoriented nighttime 
soap yellow rose 
television has rarely attempted a traditional western story in 
recent years most had a gimmick in the barbary coast on abc 
in 1976 william shatner was an undercover agent for the california 
governor and doug mcclure owner of a san francisco casino was his 
ally one of the most outrageous concepts was cbs 1986 outlaws 
in which a texas sheriff and a gang of outlaws were blasted into the 
20th century by a bolt of lightning 
its been argued that todays audience doesnt relate to westerns 
and that they get their excitement from police shows its also 
suggested that the western concept has taken a new form such as the 
space operas star trek or star wars 
it seems more likely however that audiences dont relate to 
gimmicks lonesome dove a traditional story with a strong cast 
was welcomed by viewers the nbc movie series desperado created 
by novelist elmore leonard also does well in the ratings 
besides the networks cable has gotten into the act the cbn 
family channel has a halfhour weekly western bordertown the 
show filmed on location near vancouver canada stars richard comar 
as a us marshal john brennan as a canadian mounted policeman and 
sophie barjac as marie dumont

here is a survey that threatens to undermine one 
of the most popular and cherished notions of real estate analysts 
that the percentage of firsttime homebuyers shrinks as interest 
rates and prices rise 
the notion has been so readily accepted in recent years that it 
has become esteemed as theory just one step from becoming law 
common sense seemed to support it and still seems to 
doesnt it make sense to expect firsttimers to drop out when the 
average price of a starter house rises to 77800 from 63000 and 
when interest rates fluctuate between 93 percent and 124 percent 
those changes actually occurred between the beginning of 1985 and 
march 1989 the period under study 
but an analysis of more than 150000 sales in the past five years 
now shows the percentage of firsttime buyers remained steady 
throughout the period at about 40 percent of the total regardless 
of interest rates or price jiggles 
such a finding would seem to defy one of the basic laws of 
economics 
in spite of the law monte helme vice president of century 21 
real estate corp declares there is no direct correlation between 
interest rates and home prices and the activity level of firsttime 
homebuyers 
the apparent explanation for the seeming contradiction he 
suggests is that as costs rise the average firsttime buyer is a 
few years older tends to buy a smaller house or condo and may buy 
in less expensive neighborhoods 
in short the type of firsttime buyer changes the product 
purchased changes the total number of sales might change and the 
place of purchase might too 
but according to the study of 150000 century 21 real estate 
sales throughout the country the 40 percent ratio remains almost 
fixed 
however that finding even if true doesnt mean firsttime 
buyers are unaffected by rising rates and prices obviously they 
are the study suggests for instance that some of the younger 
buyers are knocked out of the market 
but curiously the percentages of all firsttime homebuyers 
varied little in the century 21 study ranging from a low of 392 
percent in 1988 to a high of 403 percent in 1986 through the first 
quarter of 1989 the rate was 394 percent 
the findings do tend to support a contention of some active real 
estate people that homebuyers are far more flexibile and adaptive 
than they are credited with being 
a better understanding of markets may have reduced somewhat the 
perception of risk involved in homebuying new buyers for example 
recognize that their interest costs could fall rather than remain 
fixed at high levels 
in addition todays firsttime buyers have foresaken the idea of 
moving immediately into the house of their dreams evidence can be 
found in almost every city in america that young families are 
willing to lower their sights move into lesser neighborhoods and 
apply their own labor in order to raise values 
whatever judgment is finally made of the findings there is 
enough evidence already to warn economists and others from making 
the almost instant conclusion that firsttime buyers are wiped out 
by rising rates and prices

west germany is embroiled in 
controversy over a new law to permit stores to stay open thursdays 
until 9 pm 2 hours beyond the regular closing time 
labor unions and others charge it threatens family stability 
strikes have been called against a number of retailers who have 
indicated they might go along with the ladenschlussgesetz the 
storeclosing law 
the economics ministry says the whole thing the new law as well 
as the old law is completely insane 
while the revision will allow retailers to stay open later on 
thursdays starting oct 1 it mandates that those that do must close 
by 1 pm on saturdays an hour earlier than usual 
on other days stores are required by law to close by 630 pm 
and shopping is outlawed on sunday 
the intent of the new law is to help relieve consumer congestion 
on saturdays when the vast majority of working adults rush to get 
their weeks shopping done before the mandated 2 pm closing time 
parking garages are always jammed and parking spaces on the 
street are hard to find people scramble to find shopping carts and 
long lines form at cash registers 
that would seem to make thursdaynight shopping a welcome idea 
but hardly so 
walter deuss chairman of the karstadt department store chain 
the nations largest said the company had lost 5 million in sales 
this year because of strikes over the change 
employees for karstadt and other major retailers are insisting on 
new labor contracts that guarantee them a 630 pm closing time 
a recent survey of the 370000 retail business owners conducted 
by the national retailers association indicated that less than 20 
percent of consumers planned to shop on thursday nights 
that has left store owners concerned that the cost of keeping 
clerks later on thursday wont be met by a corresponding rise in 
sales 
conservatives lawmakers favored the thursday night shopping idea 
because it keeps west germans in step with their neighbors who have 
been lengthening shopping hours 
leftist politicians opposed it on grounds that it would be 
antiwomen and antichildren 
during the acrimonious battle to change the law retail workers 
unions and political groups launched advertising campaigns showing 
children left home alone while their parents wantonly shopped or 
their mothers slaved at a cash register at night 
but the thursday night law still wont make it any easier to 
figure out when to shop 
bread stores are closed on mondays because they open for two 
hours on sunday when everything else is closed 
pharmacies are closed wednesday afternoons because they stay 
open roundtheclock one weekend each month for emergencies 
all shops are allowed to close between 1230 pm and 2 pm for 
lunch the same time many workers are at lunch and could pick up a 
few things 
then there is long saturday the first saturday of the month 
when some shops though not all stay open until 6 pm but long 
saturday will be shortened by two hours after october as part of 
the government compromise to compensate for thursday nights 
the whole thing is completely insane said economics ministry 
spokesman peter vogel the old system the new system 
everything

when gis came home after world war ii 
the nation looked to the great forests of the northwest for lumber 
to build their houses 
oregon and washington mills responded and still supply more than 
a third of the lumber and plywood used in the united states 
there was always that one more shining hill covered with trees 
to the west said us forest service budget officer ron johnson 
in portland now we find theres a pacific ocean and we fell into 
it 
from the western slope of the cascade range to the shore of the 
pacific this is the home of the douglas fir the towering king of 
the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber 
it is also home to the northern spotted owl a 14inch bird that 
could face extinction because with rare exceptions it wont nest 
or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most 
prized for timber 
while logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the 
national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl 
record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are 
being shipped for premium prices to japan china and korea without 
ever seeing the inside of an american mill 
if a log is of export quality and is available to be exported 
it will be exported said tom mayr owner of the mayr brothers 
mill in hoquiam wash mayr has been reduced to counting his supply 
in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being 
loaded onto ships in grays harbor wash 
we want to put out logs to the highest value market in recent 
years the highest value has been offshore said jack taylor 
operations manager for weyerhaeuser in coos bay where the regions 
leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce 
metricdimension lumber for the japanese homebuilding market 
companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than 
they can in the domestic market said forest service economist don 
flora in seattle 
boomandbust cycles were known to the timber industry before the 
spotted owl entered the spotlight but for the first time the pinch 
is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and 
dips in the housing market 
eighteen years ago brad wentworth stopped off in the coastal 
town of gold beach to see some friends on his way to college to 
study forest management now hes 37 a husband and father and one 
of the 300 workers at gold beach plywood who will be out of a job 
this summer when the mill shuts down 
i got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages 
wentworth said i kick myself in the butt now 
thirteen other wood products mills in oregon and washington have 
closed this year putting nearly 2000 people out of work as the 
industry enters a new era of highpriced timber in short supply a 
referendum tuesday in oregon calls for a ban on exporting 
stategrown logs and asks congress to make permanent an annually 
renewed ban on exporting logs grown on federal land 
the mill is old and inefficient said gold beach mill manager 
eric saunders it would take about 3 million to bring it up why 
should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a 
stable supply of timber 
the shortage of timber doesnt come as a surprise but its 
magnitude does 
in 1976 oregon state university forestry professor john beuter 
reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that 
the industry would have to depend on national forests home to most 
of the oldgrowth timber to make it to the next century when 
secondgrowth trees planted before world war ii would be ready for 
harvest 
jerry hamilton director of resource services for seattles 
simpson timber co had expected harvests in national forests to 
decline about 20 percent in oregon and washington this year as the 
forest service revised its longrange management plans he now fears 
it could drop 50 percent because oldgrowth forests have been ruled 
offlimits because of the spotted owl 
historically a lot of the impetus for the management of 
federal lands in the west was to settle the west and develop it 
said beuter now a consultant in portland we are sort of at the 
end of that era now we are at the point of recognizing that cutting 
more timber isnt going to create new cities and new economic 
opportunity in the west in fact we are coming around to where 
saving the forests may create new economic opportunity 
ed whitelaw a university of oregon economics professor has been 
a leading proponent of the idea that the northwest has more to gain 
from preserving its blue skies green forests and clear water than 
from exploiting its resources 
most oregonians receive two paychecks he said one is in 
dollars the other comes from the environment by accounting for all 
other amenities i estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth 
13 billion the paycheck from the timber industry is 15 
billion 
in 1988 oregon and washington national forests supplied 54 
billion board feet of timber a third of the regions total harvest 
from all lands where the forest service management plans used in 
the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 55 billion board feet the 
limit in the 1990s will be closer to 47 billion 
unlike owners of private forests the forest service by law may 
cut no more timber than it can grow back it also has to provide for 
the needs of fish wildlife campers hikers and water quality 
where it once had to answer only to the timber industry the 
service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder the 
governors of washington and oregon want to be sure there is enough 
timber to sustain the rural economy environmental groups demand 
preservation of oldgrowth forests academics have started offering 
new management techniques that follow the lead of nature and there 
is new unrest inside the forest service 
jeff debonis a willamette national forest timber sale planner 
has organized the association of forest service employees for 
environmental ethics with a mailing list of about 200 debonis 
wrote in february to forest service chief dale robertson claiming 
the agency is in bed with the industry 
the question we need to ask concerned citizens is why should 
the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy 
industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut he 
said 
robertsons staff is preparing a detailed response to debonis 
letter said spokeswoman rose narlock in washington dc maybe we 
need some of these things talked about it was a gutsy move on his 
part 
robertson has acknowledged that the forest service has taken a 
beating in the courts under the national environmental policy act 
evidence debonis cites for his argument that too many trees are 
being cut 
while loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more 
timber the grim truth is jobs are disappearing spotted owl or no 
spotted owl 
the biggest source of change in employment has been the 
modernization and automation of the forest products industry said 
wilderness society economist jeffrey t olson who produced a study 
concluding the decline in timber jobs in the northwest has little to 
do with cutting old growth in national forests 
flora the forest service economist said in the 1970s he figured 
each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber 
jobs thats now down to 15 jobs in the hightech mills and four to 
five jobs overall 
timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of 
portland and seattle but still vital in small cities and towns that 
grew up with it 
oregons 68700 woodproducts jobs almost all of them outside 
the portland area account for 52 percent of the states 
employment washingtons 41800 timber jobs account for 21 percent 
of its employment in 1986 the most recent figures available 
timber accounted for just 6 percent of oregons gross state product 
at 25 billion and 22 percent of washingtons at 16 billion 
but forest service economist con schallau in corvallis argues 
timber has a greater impact than that because it accounts for 38 
percent of oregons basic economy bringing in outside dollars 
and 18 percent of washingtons 
while economists may differ over timbers importance they agree 
the places that will be hurt worst are towns like gold beach 
population 1500 with a payroll of 6 million from gold beach 
plywood 
if you live in a big city youve got a lot of choices 
wentworth said but if you live here youve got to work in the 
brush or the mill

editors note the alaska oil spill befouled hundreds of miles 
of wildlife habitat was that its extent not according to the 
people of valdez some are profiting by it but others feel it has 
polluted their entire hardluck town this is a report from alaska 
the first in an occasional series 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
not a drop of spilled oil stains the 
sparkling waters of this harbor on prince william sound the stain 
here is well ashore 
they are turning our village into a shantytown says tom 
mcalister the towns fire marshal 
that is one of the milder sentiments you hear these days from the 
2500 residents of valdez theirs is or was a gentle village that 
fate seems to have picked on over the years for more than its share 
of bad luck 
valdez is the terminal of the alaska oil pipeline its shores 
were untouched by the worstever american oil spill but it will be 
linked forever its villagers feel with the name of the tanker that 
spilled the oil 
the tanker exxon valdez filled its enormous hull here but left 
its 11 million gallons well south where it ran aground 
now valdez has become the staging ground for the thousands trying 
to clean up the mess and other thousands looking to help do it at 
wages that seem to be causing a sort of gold rush fever in valdez 
people are swarming here from all over some villagers are 
comparing the effect on their town to that of the 1964 earthquake 
an exaggeration of course because that horror so shook valdez that 
the entire citizenry had to pack up and move 10 miles away and start 
all over 
well says pat lynn thats just what i sometimes feel like 
doing just look at it 
his gesture takes in clusters of tents pitched on the hillsides 
temporary housing in the shape of boxcars left over from pipeline 
construction crews stuck on every flat place and stacked up at the 
harbor until other flat places can be found traffic jams and 
honking horns camper vehicles parked helterskelter because theres 
no room in the designated lots people standing in lines for a 
meal or a drink or a shower at the high school gym for free or 
at a truck stop to get wet for a dollar a minute 
its a damn circus says lynn 
pat lynn runs a oneperson radio station one of americas 
smallest its typical of a valdez enterprise small unambitious 
sufficient to serve a town this size he took a 75 percent cut in 
income to move to valdez from busy anchorage 
now we have suddenly become a city of 8000 transients he 
says 
our sense of intimacy has been fractured our quiet way of 
living has been torn away from us our crime rate has gone up our 
mayor told me the other day he had to go looking for his house key 
he had never needed it before 
all the reasons we chose to live in valdez out here in all 
this isolated beauty have been shattered maybe beyond repair 
its going to take forever to clean up the oil if it can be 
cleaned up which i doubt so who knows how long it will take for 
valdez to be valdez again or whether it ever will be 
no question that the shock was sudden and dramatic 
on the first day after the march 24 spill for example the 
little valdez airstrip which didnt even have a control tower had 
to handle 800 takeoffs and landings for the month of april it 
handled 8417 comparable to chicagos ohare airport one of the 
nations busiest 
no question either that the impact has been all the more 
jarring because of the serene natural beauty of this northeastern 
corner of prince william sound 
alaskans call valdez little switzerland herman ruess an 
airplane pilot who left switzerland to come here says the 
description is apt 
ruess will take you to the face of the sounds 17 glaciers and 
let you watch them cast great chunks of ice into the sea a 
phenomenon called calving creation still in progress 
ruess likes to take the scenic route from valdez back to his base 
in anchorage he banks his airplane low over icestrewn waters 
looking for seals finding them 
no houses no highways no nothing he says grinning 
isnt it beautiful 
mountains embrace valdez on three sides they were sculpted by 
ice and the ages and a hand with all the time in the world 
the winter snowfall 300 inches or more never quite leaves the 
peaks it lingers in crevasses and shaded pockets like milk poured 
from a dipper 
lower on the slopes emeraldgreen alder and cottonwood surround 
cascades of snow melt waterfalls that nourish heather and lupine 
and wild strawberries in the winter the waterfalls freeze in 
midflow climbers who come here call valdez the yosemite of ice 
i think one reason the oil spill so upset people in the lower 
48 says joe leahy a valdez resident is because even if they 
never have a chance to come to alaska they like to know that its 
here i know i felt that way when i lived in cleveland 
leahy is the curator of the valdez museum not too many towns of 
2500 have a museum of this ones scope but valdez has a history 
deserving of it a history leahy says that reassures him in his 
mind there is a certain valdez spirit that will enable it to recover 
from its current woe 
we here are sort of different he says we dont exactly 
fit in elsewhere we gravitated to valdez because people are not so 
judgmental about other peoples quirks and personalities because we 
have our own were all more or less kindred 
what gives us our tenacity is that if valdez were to disappear 
we wouldnt have many places left to go 
leahy moved to valdez from juneau five years ago he left there 
not because he saw it grow from 15000 to 30000 but because the 
owner of a hardware store where he had done business for 13 years 
all of a sudden required two pieces of identification to take his 
check

its our mutual trust and intimacy that we hope not to lose in 
valdez leahy says 
valdez became a place on naval charts in 1790 when a spanish 
explorer salvador fidalgo saw the ports exquisite beauty and 
named it for his boss just as captain james cook named prince 
william sound for his 
it remained only that a name on a map until 1898 when 
goldseekers docked here to take a shortcut to the klondike over an 
indian trail across the valdez glacier many of them decided halfway 
across the rugged ice that no amount of gold was worth the trip and 
came back before long valdez became a town of more than 4500 
when the gold boom died valdez survived but for decade after 
decade misfortune seemed to visit little valdez with uncommon 
regularity mostly fires sometimes disease somehow it managed to 
settle into a closeknit community with schools and churches and a 
fishing fleet and a way of life that sturdy folk with an eye for 
natures gifts found attractive 
then in 1964 americas worst earthquake struck it recorded 85 
on the richter scale and its epicenter was in prince william sound 
it destroyed valdez it left the ground under what remained of the 
town so unstable that everybody had to move to a more solid 
foundation 10 miles away 
they brought with them the town fire bell which had saved many 
of them and the oaken bar from the pinzon saloon which had 
succored many more both are in joe leahys museum they laid out a 
new town with broad streets and grand old trees where bald eagles 
nested 
the new valdez prospered especially when it was chosen as the 
terminal of the oil pipeline 
but the town always knew that the oil bonanza could end 
someday just as the gold bonanza did leahy says 
so when valdez rebuilt it put its chips not on oil but on 
tourism fifty cruise ships tie up every summer at valdez and 
hundreds of visitors awed by the scenery and the towns 
hospitality come ashore for about a threehour stay other tourists 
motor here in campers and stay longer all in all about 100000 
sightseers a year 
the largest item on the town budget is for beautification 
flowers trees grass 
look at it now says leahy cyclone fences with barbed wire 
on top we never allowed that before but exxon seems to need it 
security guards are at every building where exxon has rented office 
space security guards in valdez 
a stand of trees has been bulldozed to make room for those 
temporary barracks and other equipment well eagles used to perch 
there an eagle wont sit on an exxon radio tower or satellite dish 
if what the tourists see here is chaos they certainly wont 
recommend an alaska cruise to their neighbors the people with 
campers will stay away too when word gets around on the cb radio 
circuit that theres no place to park 
there is in fact no place to park or to sleep where will 
valdez accommodate the seasonal workers who come every summer to 
operate the fish processing plants nobody knows but then there 
might not be much fish processing this year the oil spill has 
eliminated commercial fishing in the most productive salmon area of 
prince william sound 
some in valdez of course benefit from the spill 
a local joke alluding to the charges against the skipper of the 
exxon valdez is that exxon is spending money like a drunken sailor 
the company pays up to 25 an hour counting the overtime to 
help clean up the oil a fisherman can get 1000 a day for the use 
of his boat to go skim oil so why fish one valdezian a lab 
technician appalled at the largesse earned 2700 for a weeks 
work and donated most of it to the prince william sound conservation 
alliance for lobbying against oil interests 
in valdez rooms in private homes are going for 100 a night a 
mattress on the floor for 50 at one restaurant the menu was 
reprinted same menu higher prices the pipeline club a popular 
place for dinner doubled its staff but not its prices and doubled 
its profits it now serves breakfast and lunch as well as dinner and 
keeps the bar open from 8 am until 5 am when state law says it 
must close 
on the day of the spill a woman from fairbanks drove 350 miles 
to a valdez trailer park where she rents out her camper for 60 a 
night from each of four people two to a bed no toilet jackie 
robb the manager of the valdez branch bank posted signs asking 
campers please not to use the parking lot as a restroom 
valdez had never had a fastfood joint now it has a trailer 
with a window in the side pulled up near the dock with three signs 
burger king open and help wanted 
tom mcalister the fire marshal has postponed his retirement 
plans i cant leave the town like this he says i just 
cant his wife gloria says she has to wait dinner for tom every 
night sometimes until midnight 
joe michaud the police chief has his hands full as well 
he has been too busy to compile the figures for may and june but 
in april he recorded 81 arrests last april he recorded 15 last 
year the valdez ambulance answered 20 calls this year so far 44 
drunk drivers all of last year totaled three so far this year more 
than 20 
i certainly understand people going where they can to find a 
job says michaud ive done that myself and 90 percent of 
these people cause no trouble even though just being here is a real 
strain on the town 
we will get through this we will handle it 
yes but it does seem unfair that the little village destroyed by 
americas worst earthquake must endure the anguish of americas 
worst oil spill 
it is unfair says pat lynn because the earthquake was 
natures doing this was mans

editors note in a land of vast forests and waterways millions 
of people in the soviet union are now afraid of the air they 
breathe the food they eat and the water they drink anger over 
pollution of the environment has created the first national 
political issue born of mikhail gorbachevs glasnost era some 
activists are even using the issue to question the foundations of 
soviet power 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the shaleoil fields on the soviet 
baltic coast of estonia more than 90 children have lost their hair 
since january to an ailment apparently caused by the dirty 
environment 
far to the south in arid central asia irrigation threatens to 
suck dry the aral sea which once covered an area the size of the 
netherlands and belgium rivers that feed it teem with intestinal 
viruses dysentery and typhoid and mothers are advised not to 
breastfeed their babies to avoid transmitting disease 
fish caught near the arctic mouth of siberias mighty ob river 
reek of oil and are rendered inedible by sludge dumped along the 
rivers more than 1800mile path 
in a land with a nearmystical attachment to its endless birch 
and fir forests and its waterways yielding sturgeon and caviar 
millions of people now are afraid of the air they breathe the food 
they eat and the water they drink 
citizens anger turned loose by president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms has created the first national political issue born of the 
glasnost era the battle to save the environment some activists 
are even using the issue to question the foundations of soviet power 
the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986 is only the 
most visible of a saddening series of environmental disasters whose 
financial and physical toll remains largely uncalculated 
as soviets reevaluate dictator josef stalin they blame their 
polluted land on the breakneck development of heavy industry and 
centralized control he imposed and which his successors followed 
gorbachev is trying to reverse those policies 
all ecological problems are rooted in extensive technologies of 
the use of natural resources the monopoly of ministries a lack of 
effective government control of the use and conservation of natural 
resources noted biologist vladimir sokolov in the government 
newspaper izvestia 
but ants paju editor of the estonian nature magazine eesti 
loodus blamed a spiritual emptiness and the soviet way of life 
itself for the problems we have turned into living corpses 
paju said in an interview 
the worse our internal state the greater the possibility to do 
terrible things to our environment said paju who narrowly lost a 
parliamentary race against a top estonian official this spring 
it is not just ecology added 58yearold endel lippmaa an 
estonian scientist who won election ecology leads to the question 
of technology to central planning politics constitutional change 
and sovereignty 
moscow ministries pushed to meet planned production targets 
are not interested in the consequences lippmaa said they are 
after a quick gain we want to decide in estonia what is to be done 
what is not to be done 
writers raised the ecology question shortly after gorbachev took 
power in 1985 by successfully challenging plans to reverse northern 
rivers to flow south and irrigate central asia 
beginning a year later in estonia the concern over oilshale and 
phosphate mining coalesced into the peoples front movement that led 
the tiny baltic republics government in november 1988 to declare 
its sovereignty from moscow in all areas except defense and foreign 
policy 
in other baltic republics the ukraine moldavia armenia 
tadzhikistan kazakhstan uzbekistan the polluted industrial cities 
of the urals and around siberias lake baikal citizens have used 
the estonian example to tackle not only ecological issues but local 
ethnic demands and questions of local control 
in a speech in the ukrainian capital of kiev in february 
gorbachev welcomed the activity of local environmental groups 
however he added looking the truth straight in the eye we have 
to say that we still are far from the desired turn for the better 
as he rebuilds soviet foreign policy gorbachev has stressed that 
pollution is an issue on a par with nuclear weaponry in the threat 
it poses to humanitys survival 
the abundance of natural resources and an economic system that 
regards them as common property with no market price have led 
soviets to chronically undervalue the riches their land has been 
blessed with 
reformers are now demanding that industries start paying a 
realistic price for the resources they use and for cleaning up the 
mess they leave behind but that squeezes managers as they struggle 
to operate without government subsidies

over the past decade the soviet union has spent 112 billion on 
envirnomental protection but that has proven inadequate 
fifty million soviets or almost onefifth of the population 
live in cities where air pollution periodically exceeds acceptable 
norms by 10 times says fyodor morgun chairman of the soviet 
committee for environmental protection 
every year 20 cubic kilometers of sewage is dumped directly into 
soviet rivers and lakes he told the weekly newspaper arguments and 
facts 
the estonian newspaper kodumaa said 92 children and two adults 
living in and around the town of sillamae population 20000 had 
lost their hair from january to midapril 
it said lippmaa had determined that the oilshale layers around 
the town contained high concentrations of radium a government 
commission found increased levels of lead and antimony in their 
fingernails and saliva 
the paper quoted estonian health minister laur karu as saying 
about 400 chemical compounds could cause the baldness experts have 
not been able to pinpoint the cause of the affliction nor of a 
similar loss of hair in the ukrainian city of chernovtsy 
a national campaign has sprung up to save the aral sea located 
on the border of uzbekistan and kazakhstan 
the tass news agency said the shoreline of the sea once 25800 
square miles in area has receded drastically if things go this 
way at the same pace as in the past 25 years the aral sea will 
cease to exist by the year 2010 being converted into a number of 
lakes with great water salinity the news agency said 
about 35 percent to 40 percent of the flow of syr darya and amu 
darya the rivers that feed the aral sea is composed of industrial 
wastes city sewage and drainage water but millions of people still 
depend on the waterways for drinking water said mukhtar shakhanov 
a leader of the kazakhstan writers union 
the number of intestinal viruses in the syr darya exceeds 
acceptable norms by thousands of times he said typhoid dysentery 
and other diseases also are present 
there have been 65000 cases of hepatitis among the 500000 
residents of the kzylordinsky region in the past 15 years he said 
child mortality on the banks of the aral is one of the highest 
in the world in some regions of the republic doctors recommend 
against feeding babies mothers milk mothers milk is poisoned 
wrote tulepbergen kaipbergenov in the karakapaki region south of the 
aral sea 
spokeswoman gafkha namatova of the informal political group belik 
said that an average of 119 pounds of chemicals are used on every 
247 acres of land in uzbekistan and that exposure has caused the 
infant mortality rate to soar 
im not afraid to use this word its genocide she said in 
an interview 
shakhanov said that among the chemicals still used on fields are 
ddt and butifos which he described as a defoliant similar to agent 
orange 
morgun said the soviet unions expenditures on the environment 
are dwarfed by the united states estimated 80 billion a year and 
that money is in the wrong hands 
we should not forget that most of the money was spent to build 
waste treatment facilities by ministries whose factories pollute the 
environment he said construction proceeds very slowly and the 
facilities provide nothing more than minimal treatment 
morguns agency which was created only last year as the kremlin 
recognized the extent of the countrys pollution problem has taken 
in 140 million in fines brought civil suit against 32000 people 
and criminal charges against 46 he said 
sergei pegov head of the department of systematic ecology at the 
scientific research center said the goal of a new government 
antipollution program is to end dumping of sewage by the year 2000 
bring water quality up to acceptable standards by 2005 to cut air 
pollution by half by 2005 and car emissions by 48 percent 
pegov told izvestia on may 1 that state enterprises would have to 
start paying for natural resources and for dirtying the environment 
but he said scientists had not yet had enough time to work out 
technological options for reducing pollution and that the plan is 
weakened by not putting one agency fully in charge of environmental 
protection 
pegov asserted the soviet union will be able to meet its goals 
because political reforms will allow officials to deal with the 
issue rather than ignore it 
but lippmaa said the soviet union is nowhere near turning the 
corner at this point our main problem is not cleaning up its 
avoiding further damage he said

editors note hes the pt barnum of west virginia politics a 
showman remembered for ridding the state of thousands of junked cars 
and bringing running water to thousands of rural homes but a james 
manchin could lose his job as state treasurer a state investment 
firm supervised by his staff lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 
the new york bond market and he faces trial by the state senate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a james manchin west virginias 
flamboyant state treasurer whose alliterative oratory and 
distinctive dress helped make him one of the states most popular 
politicians is in the fight of his life 
manchin whose theatrics have brought him both fame and derision 
has been impeached by state house of delegates and faces trial in 
the state senate on july 10 over the loss of hundreds of millions of 
dollars from a state investment fund his office supervised 
if twothirds of the 34 senators vote against him the 
62yearold former high school coach will be removed from office and 
could lose his pension 
a man who never met anyone he didnt know and who never found a 
word he couldnt squeeze into a mangled metaphor manchin 
acknowledges his reputation as something of a clown could be working 
against him 
so what it made me he says you cant have it both ways 
i think maybe im an easy target and you have to understand 
ive made a lot of enemies 
the son of italian immigrants manchin has been a legislator 
teacher state director of the farmers home admininstration 
secretary of state and state treasurer 
but it was during his tenure as director of reap the 
rehabilitation environmental action program created to rid the 
state of junked cars and abandoned appliances that manchin became 
a household name 
he appeared on posters made public service commercials and was 
the subject of a song he claimed the program rid the state of 
100000 junked cars but later acknowledged the total was about 
30000 
wearing his traditional dark suits bow ties and a hat usually a 
widebrimmed white fedora manchin took his show on the road posing 
atop rusted junkers with a sledgehammer and proclaiming to the 
assembled television cameras that he intended to remove these 
jezebels of junkery mash this mess of muckery or eliminate 
this truculent trash 
if he couldnt find the right word manchin made one up 
we come to report that reap will not relapse into a reverie of 
remoteness but will press ever harder to save a world which is bent 
on drowning itself in a deluge of debris he said in one fit of 
alliteration on another day he proclaimed that reap will not 
fiddle while cub scouts on a camping trip fizzle in filthery 
i was the original 30second sound bite let us do battle 
against this bastion of bacteria manchin said during an 
interview in his cluttered office well you can say that in 30 
seconds because how do you explain anything in 30 seconds 
you know why people knew me it was entertaining look at that 
clown so weve got that kind of reputation and i dont mind it 
in the years since then manchin has toned down his rhetoric 
although he still tends to end his correspondence including press 
releases with the phrase may the bright morning star be a lamp 
unto our feet 
the lobby to his office resembles a flea market with two 9foot 
bookcases loaded with dozens of volunteer fire department helmets a 
display of different types of us currency a stack of sheet music 
of the state song and the remnants of a flea circus manchin rescued 
from the capitol basement 
on his office wall along with a framed drawing of the statue of 
liberty and paintings of his parents jesus and presidents harry 
truman and franklin d roosevelt is a plaque that quotes teddy 
roosevelt 
far better it is to dare mighty things to win glorious 
triumphs even though checkered by failure than to take rank with 
those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because 
they live in the gray twilight that knows no victory nor defeat 
three months after manchin received that plaque from his staff in 
january 1987 the treasurers investment staff ran into trouble 
while living by that creed trying to maintain phenomenal interest 
earnings on its investments sometimes averaging 14 percent or more 
by trading heavily in the new york bond market the treasurers 
employees began to fail and fail big 
in one month the investment staff had lost 100 million from the 
18 billion fund former gov arch moore before leaving office 
last january said the losses eventually totaled 279 million 
manchin says they totaled 231 million 
manchin says he was never told of the losses until auditors made 
them public the house of delegates voting 6534 in march to 
impeach him on 17 counts said either he knew and did nothing to 
stop them or else he didnt know but should have 
manchins supporters call him the peoples servant always ready 
to hear their complaints about any facet of state government and do 
his best to find a solution his opponents call him a buffoon who 
spends more time traveling around the state handing out cheap 
trinkets and making speeches than doing his job testimony during 
house impeachment procedings placed him out of the office up to 
three out of every five days 
everybody plays on the fact that well if i had been here 
more im here as much as any public official because i take 
care of my responsibilities manchin says

they make it look like i was out ignoring my duty but you 
understand that the office that i have always sat in as a public 
servant it extends throughout the state in other words when i am 
out there signing a loan or breaking ground thats an extension of 
my office 
even his supporters however have had trouble defending some of 
manchins antics 
manchin is not an intellectual giant state del pat bradley 
one of the treasurers staunchest defenders said during the 
impeachment proceedings i grant you the man is barnum amp bailey 
all the way through he wears those crazy hats the fact that the 
guy is halflooney is not impeachable 
hes been called a buffoon more than once but manchin once said 
there is not a single pickle missing from my jar 
manchin traces his interest in public service to his parents in 
the coal camp of farmington where he was born in a united mine 
workers barracks during a coal strike 
my mother cared about people manchin says when anyone was 
down and out in farmington who did they come to they came to my 
mama kay if someone has trouble they drank too much their mother 
and father couldnt handle them and threw them out of the house who 
did they come to my mother mama kay when girls were having 
trouble some of them got pregnant out of wedlock who do you think 
they came to so all my life we were associated with reaching out 
and touching the lives of others where did i get started with a 
mother who cared about people 
my father joseph manchin sr was a magistrate in those days 
it was justice of the peace you understand i worked with him 49 
years ago that would make me what about 13 years old i can see 
this man that people would come to his office id see my father 
talk to them counsel them and turn them in the right direction 
after a stint in the navy manchin enrolled at west virginia 
university where he got his first taste of politics while running 
for sophomore class president campaigning from a horse and buggy 
i campaigned on a famous song moonlight cocktails i think 
it was glenn millers song he said pausing to sing softly for a 
few seconds 
thats what i promised hayrides and moonlight cocktails i 
was defeated 
in 1948 at age 21 manchin was elected to the house of delegates 
from marion county at the time the youngest legislator ever elected 
in west virginia he blames his defeat two years later to a bill he 
introduced to eliminate the states segregated schools 
after working as a high school teacher and coach he was 
appointed by president john f kennedy as state director of the 
farmers home administration 
we brought water pure water to half a million people who did 
not have water in their homes who could not enjoy a good glass of 
lemonade that couldnt have a good cup of coffee that couldnt 
take a shower he said half a million people one hundred 
thousand homes and it has been said that many of them finally got 
indoor plumbing and they think of me when they flush their 
commode 
in 1973 he became director of reap and resigned for a successful 
run for secretary of state in 1976 manchin was elected to two terms 
as secretary of state then was elected to the first of two terms as 
state treasurer in 1984 the investment fund losses occurred in 1987 
but didnt become public until december 1988 after he had been 
reelected without opposition 
despite his political problems manchin remains the man many 
people want to see when they visit the state capitol tour groups 
make his office a regular stop and manchin expresses disappointment 
if he is tied up on a telephone call and cant greet a group of 
junior high school students before they leave for other parts of the 
capitol his office handles hundreds of phone calls a day from 
people inquiring about every type of government service from tax 
refunds to road repairs he has a fulltime ombudsman on his staff 
whether its network television national magazines local 
newspapers or public speakers no one is safe from manchins 
wellpublicized wrath if he perceives a slur on his native state 
an insult of insane proportions is how he once described a 
magazine advertisement for hot dogs that he said unfairly depicted 
west virginians as dirty he once said nbc faced the winds of 
war because today show weatherman willard scotts map of the 
united states omitted west virginias northern panhandle 
hes been constantly criticized by lawmakers for spending his 
budget on ceremonial certificates and other doodads naming 
recipients commodore of the ship of state or public friend no 
1 he holds an annual ceremony so he can award his order of the 
35th star to senior citizens 
sometimes riding on an elephant or being on top of a junked 
car or using alliteration clowning around it gets attention 
manchin said 
the point were trying to make is that i have a sense of humor 
i am a james manchin im not cloned of anybody im not going to 
be one im going to be who i am 
and when they lay me away on a hill in farmington wva 
theyll say here lies a james manchin he loved his god he loved 
his state he loved his family and he did it all and said it all

editors note with enrollments in the nations colleges of 
agriculture declining at a time of strong demand for people trained 
in agricultural sciences graduates of a special high school in 
chicago are prime candidates for scholarships though its located 
in a big city its one of only two high schools in the nation 
focusing on agriculture 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its a high school with a livestock judging team 
a field full of vegetables and a greenhouse full of flowers 
no football team no cheerleaders 
in chicago of all places 
the chicago high school for agricultural sciences opened four 
years ago on the southwest edge of this city of 3 million the last 
stop before the suburbs and rural countryside its one of only two 
in the nation focusing on agriculture and university recruiters 
lined up with scholarships for its first graduates this spring 
if we cant find students in the country well find them in 
the city says roger bruene of the iowa state university college 
of agriculture you dont have to grow up on a farm to take 
advantage of these excellent career opportunities 
these ag companies are crying for people especially 
minorities says horticulture teacher ron biondo we had 19 
universities here a few weeks ago recruiting our kids 
the first 86 graduates received their diplomas june 23 in a 
ceremony at the chicago board of trade where the nations major 
farm commodities are bought and sold 
the new school was welcomed by colleges of agriculture because 
their enrollments were declining at a time when there was a strong 
demand for people trained in agricultural sciences food 
engineering finance and marketing 
this is a futuristic bridge between a metropolitan area and new 
job opportunities in the food and natural resource system says 
allan goecker of purdue university 
the graduating seniors raised and sold crops on the schools 
72acre farm spent weekends with farm families hundreds of miles 
away and worked afternoons and summers for major agribusiness 
companies 
i knew i was interested in science and chemistry but when i 
got here i really got excited about agriculture says corie 
yearby who will study agronomy at alcorn university in mississippi 
i see all these career opportunities in agriculture and i want 
to be part of it said theresa garza who will attend lincoln 
university in missouri and eventually hopes to grow crops in outer 
space 
the small high school reflects the racial balance of the citys 
public school system 80 percent of its 435 students are black or 
hispanic they are recruited for their interest not their grades 
if johnny cant add two and two you dont say he cant come 
here says assistant principal kevin mccarthy you say to the 
parents does johnny want to come here and do you want him to come 
here 
students face a tough academic program in the longest school day 
in chicago and nearly 50 percent more class credits than other high 
schools 
but there is no shortage of applications for every freshman 
accepted another qualified student is turned away 
parents and students are attracted because the school is 
relatively small and safe and there is a likelihood of college and 
good jobs later 
they learn about soil landscaping and horticulture and they 
use these skills says gloria yearby cories mother it gives 
them a real incentive to go on to college 
the students have grown up in the city and for many biondos 
horticulture class is the first opportunity to have flower petals 
between their fingers and dirt under their nails 
in the greenhouse sophomore julie berner watered and fertilized 
geraniums some of the 50000 bedding plants grown and sold by the 
students the sale raised 7000 for the school 
just listening to lectures in class would be boring but this 
is exciting handson experience in horticulture she says 
outside students fed the floppyeared rabbits they raised and 
showed in competition janet martinez a junior won first place 
with buffy her black angora 
i want to be a veterinarian and i know this is the right start 
an agricultural high school she says 
down the hall the floral design lab was strewn with pieces of 
stem from the cutting table there were cut flowers in a cooler a 
diagram of plant parts on the wall a chalk drawing of a celosia 
and young violets growing under lights 
students sell their arrangements including many that are used at 
official board of education activities 
i had one girl with a learning disability who never had gotten 
good grades says donna theimer who teaches floral design but 
she loved this class and now she has a career goal she can actually 
attain 
in the computer laboratory freshman tracy givens and classmates 
work on 34 terminals computer training is required 
you just have a lot more opportunities here a lot more 
responsibility says miss givens wearing a yellow shirt and cap 
advertising the webberville mich corn festival 
visits with families in farm country give students a close look

principal barbara valerious says a key to the success of the high 
school has been the companies that provide specialized equipment for 
laboratories guest speakers for classes and jobs for students 
vicky greer a junior spent last summer at michigan state 
university working in the animal science department helping with 
palatability tests on feed for steers 
senior jerome offord works after classes at the chicago board of 
trade where he distributes literature to the public and helps 
organize seminars like the other students with agrelated jobs he 
earns credit for high school and money for college 
and now i really understand how the markets work says 
offord who will attend lincoln university to study agricultural 
education 
he is one of six students working at the board of trade 
according to lisa foss education and marketing coordinator 
one major agricultural company interested in the high school is 
dow chemical co of midland mich a manufacturer of farm 
chemicals and seed dow will provide four of the high schools 
graduates with 2500ayear scholarships and summer jobs says 
company spokesman garry hamlin he said dow wants them to be 
interested in careers in agriculture and with dow 
we recognize a shortage of strong researchanddevelopment 
people in the field today hamlin says 
at purdue university goecker helped prepare a report for the 
us department of agriculture on demand for graduates of 
agricultural colleges he said the report concluded the schools will 
turn out 44000 students a year to fill 48000 jobs 
the bottom line is about a 10 percent shortfall in the late 
1980s in terms of graduates goecker says a lot of firms are in 
the marketplace aggressively trying to hire people 
hamlin says for example dow would pay an agricultural 
researcher with a bachelor of science degree between 24000 and 
29000 a year to start and would pay up to 38000 for someone 
with a doctorate 
we are having trouble getting qualified people into 
biotechnology research says jim altemus of the monsanto 
agricultural co a st louisbased chemical manufacturer these 
are support people who have an exposure to science biology 
chemistry math and are patient accurate and understand the metric 
system 
goecker says enrollment in colleges of agriculture peaked at 
about 100000 in 197677 then fell to a low of about 66000 in 1987 
educators blame economic stress on the farm and the incorrect 
notion that agriculture means only farming raising crops and 
livestock 
ag is becoming more hightech all the time says bonnie 
johnson of washington state university where agricultural 
enrollments dropped 40 percent during the early 1980s people have 
not seen agriculture as science food processing and finance 
that was one of the first problems the new chicago high school 
had to deal with 
in the city you say agriculture and people think dumb 
farmer biondo says first farmers arent dumb theyre smart 
second agriculture is much more than farming 
biondo like the other 10 teachers who came to the chicago school 
in 1985 was hired from outside the district there simply were no 
teachers in chicago qualified to teach the agricultural courses 
there now are 43 faculty members and all but two of the original 
teachers remain on campus 
biondo who was recruited after a wellpublicized 1984 meeting 
with president ronald reagan at the will county center where biondo 
taught liked the idea of a totally new approach to high school and 
he liked the students he would work with 
there are racial and ethnic differences he says they are 
louder streetsmart kids who dont intimidate easily but there 
are some really bright motivated kids here 
there also are some drawbacks 
quarters are cramped in the remodeled elementary school despite 
a 1987 addition and five modular classrooms outside the main brick 
building 
files are piled on windowsills one classroom is converted to a 
gym by moving desks and throwing mats on the floor another becomes 
the cafeteria when lunch is delivered 
the students are demanding 
they wont let a teacher sit around says marcia 
watmanlauchner who teaches agricultural communications and food 
science and works on the schools curriculum they want to learn 
and work hard and they demand our time and information theyll 
tell you what they want from you 
the racial makeup of the school also has caused a few problems in 
the white uppermiddle class mount greenwood neighborhood 
valerious says black students have been targets of bottlethrowing 
and namecalling though the majority of people in the neighborhood 
support the school and admire the students 
mccarthy said only three students who enrolled in 1985 dropped 
out of high school and thats phenomenal in four years in the 
city

editors note for the past 10 years capuchin monkeys chosen 
for their small size and ability to perform simple tasks have been 
working as helping hands for disabled people but a bostonbased 
organization that matches monkeys with handicapped people is losing 
its government financing this year and now must turn to corporations 
and individuals for donations to continue the work

robert fosters life changed forever one 
rainy day 14 years ago while driving to an auto parts store he was 
traveling no more than 30mph when he lost control of his car and hit 
a tree 
his spinal cord was irreparably bruised and foster woke up in his 
hospital bed a quadriplegic 
after several years in rehabilitation foster moved into a 
onebedroom apartment he was alone and nearly helpless all day 
except for an hour or so in the morning and evening when a personal 
attendant came to bathe and feed him 
shortly after watching a television show about the possible use 
of monkeys to aid quadriplegics foster made a phone call that 
changed his life again 
he got in touch with mary jo willard a former research assistant 
to behaviorist bf skinner 
willard now the director of the bostonbased organization 
helping hands simian aides for the disabled first thought of 
matching monkeys with the handicapped after visiting a quadriplegic 
in the hospital and discovering how many small tasks he was unable 
to perform 
within weeks foster now 32 was made a guinea pig in willards 
fledgling program he was matched with a capuchin monkey named 
hellion who was trained on the job and often lived up to her name 
after several rocky years foster and hellion are now such a team 
that fosters mother refers to the monkey as her granddaughter 
she can work for me shes a friend and shes good at breaking 
down the barriers between people in wheelchairs and people walking 
around foster says 
since 1979 capuchin monkeys chosen for their small size and 
ability to perform simple tasks have been placed with 15 
quadriplegics around the country the monkeys are bred at walt 
disney world in orlando fla 
shes instant help says mitch kaufman 34 of portland 
ore who has a 6yearold monkey peepers 
kaufman who was injured in a car accident on his 30th birthday 
says peepers does most of the tasks he once had to wait hours for 
attendants to perform 
i can just let her loose he says and shes sort of like a 
friend but really funny shes somebody there that wasnt there 
before she kind of fills up a space 
the program is designed to provide more than just technical help 
for the handicapped the monkeys placed with quadriplegics often 
become like family allowing quadriplegics to care for someone else 
instead of always being the victims willard says 
the quality of their lives is so enriched says willard who 
financed the program herself for the first two years while working a 
parttime job its wonderful to see such severely disabled people 
get so happy and excited about something 
helping hands also involves foster homes around the country 
where young monkeys live for their first several years to grow 
accustomed to a home environment they are then returned to boston 
for training and placement more than 80 young monkeys are currently 
with foster families but the waiting list for monkeys numbers in 
the hundreds willard says 
mary ann feller of silverton ore has taken care of kris a 
nearly 4yearold monkey for three years she and her family are 
preparing to return kris to boston within the next few months 
i think itll be real traumatic feller says they become 
such a part of your life but we knew it was short term thats why 
you raise them knowing they will eventually leave to help 
quadriplegics its like raising guide dogs you have to think in 
that way or else you mourn and weep when theyre gone 
willards idea which later became a favorite topic for 
television talk shows and news magazines and even the inspiration 
for the horror movie monkeyshines almost never came to 
fruition she was turned down by 38 agencies over two years 
it was enormously discouraging willard says people just 
thought it would fail and they would be embarrassed by it 
willard was about to give up when a reporter for a medical 
journal spotted a paper she had written about her program the 
journal ran a story on the program and other press coverage 
followed soon willard says the agencies that had rejected the 
idea saw it as more viable 
since then the difference the monkeys have made in the lives of 
the severely handicapped has been enormous 
foster remembers well what it was like before hellion moved into 
his neat one bedroom apartment in a complex for the elderly in 
watertown just outside boston he has no mobility below his upper 
shoulders and uses a mouthstick to operate his motorized wheelchair 
hellion feeds foster snacks left by an attendant and dials a 
speaker phone for him he also knows how to turn on the television 
stereo and vcr 
it used to be that if a door shut behind me i couldnt open it 
up and id be stuck there all day foster says if i dropped my 
mouthstick i wouldnt be able to move from that spot until my 
attendant came in at night 
the program which has been financed by the veterans 
administration loses its funding this year recently us rep 
joseph p kennedy ii introduced legislation that would allow 
serviceconnected quadriplegic veterans to receive a monkey much 
the same way they are now entitled to devices like wheelchairs and 
pageturners from the government 
willard and program director judy zazula hope the program will 
receive enough sponsorship from companies like animal food 
manufacturer purina mills and individual donations to continue at 
present the program receives 300000 in funding 
zazula 33 has worked with willard from the start of the program 
and directs the training of the monkeys she works 12hour days at 
the boston training center where she spends long hours in a 
wheelchair simulating tasks for the monkeys currently there are 18 
monkeys being trained at the center 
zazula is so devoted to her charges that hellion fosters 
monkey was the flower primate at her wedding last summer 
i look at the people weve helped and i just cant believe this 
program could end zazula says the monkeys have become the 
focus of their lives

when the cameras are turned off on the set of 
abcs full house bob saget and the other actors sometimes 
pretend theyre doing other shows 
we kid that im richie cunningham and were doing happy 
days says saget david coulier is ralph and potsie and john 
stamos is the fonz or we kid that were doing charlies angels 
john is jaclyn smith david is farrah fawcett and im kate jackson 
its just a way to have fun 
full house is about six people living in one house and loving 
each other the three guys and my three daughters saget says 
we really do care for each other usually people in a show love 
each other because they get paid 
saget stars as danny a san francisco tv talk show host and 
widower with three daughters who asks his brotherinlaw and a 
friend to move in and help him run the household stamos is uncle 
jesse a former musician who now writes advertising jingles coulier 
is joey a standup comedian together they all fill the house with 
laughs 
the daughters are candace cameron jodie sweetin and twins mary 
kate and ashley fuller olsen as baby michelle 
it took about 13 weeks for me and the writers to figure out who 
danny is saget says its the first time ive had an 
opportunity to develop a character it took me longer to get a grip 
on my character than the other actors i knew i wanted him to be 
neat and i knew i wanted him to hug a lot those were the external 
things 
the internal thing is that theres an undercurrent of sadness 
because his wife died in an automobile accident only a year before 
he really does need all this love in his life the thing i like 
about him is that like rihie cunningham hes really a nice guy 
saget had worked mostly as a standup comic prior to full 
house although his training at temple university and the 
university of southern california was in filmmaking a documentary 
he wrote directed and edited through adams eyes was honored 
at the los angeles filmex 
director steven spielberg asked him to send him his next film 
i did and it sat in his office for a year saget says it was 
awful and pretentious a 22yearold kid being cocky didnt go over 
it was called beach blanket blintz three hundred people showed up 
for a screening because their kids were in it everyone hated the 
film 
he was featured in the movie critical condition and was a 
guest star on various tv series his work as a comic landed him 
appearances on the tonight show the merv griffin show

in 1987 he became a regular on cbs morning program with 
mariette hartley and rolland smith 
i joined the directors guild with cbs paying and i did two 
comedy videos a week for morning program he says then i 
found out how difficult it is to make two videos a week the show 
wasnt on very long but i actually think it could have worked i 
guess at that time people werent ready for comedy that early in the 
morning i think a time will come when youll have comedy on tv like 
you have on the morning drive radio shows 
saget was on the morning program when he was offered the role 
in full house 
the people at the morning program wanted to get rid of me and 
i wanted to leave he says i was out of work three weeks the 
pilot was filmed with another actor as danny and i replaced him

working with the girls on the show theyre my pseudochildren 
he says ill do things with the girls that i know ill be doing 
with my own daughter when she gets older 
while he likes working in a television comedy hes also eager to 
do more films 
the sitcom format is very easy he says but you cant be 
natural you have an audience while you film and your volume has to 
be up your energy level has to be high when i did critical 
condition i really felt at home 
saget was born in philadelphia but grew up in norfolk va and 
southern california 
the family returned to philadelphia just in time for him to 
graduate from high school where he met his wife sherri he got his

jeff gordon calls himself an actorbat 
eight times a week he dives jumps spins leaps falls and 
tumbles into the orchestra pit at broadways st james theater 
and audiences gasp his stunts provide some of the funniest and 
most unexpected moments in largely new york a comedy without 
dialogue written by directed by and starring clown bill irwin 
in the 65minute entertainment irwin battles video technology 
recalcitrant remote controls temperamental television sets 
malevolent minicams and loses hilariously but the show also 
features gordon two break dancers named leon chesney and steve 
clemente a ballerina named margaret eginton and a gaggle of dancers 
dressed like academics in cap and gown 
bill irwin is a pioneer in proving to the show business 
establishment that clowns are very talented people gordon says 
they are not just buffoons they reflect human nature there is a 
pervasive american attitude that clowns are the underbelly of show 
business secondclass performers bill is proving that you can have 
roots in the circus and physical comedy and still be a 
thinkingmans clown 
in the show gordon plays a character called the dean an 
officious authority figure who leads this rubberlegged band of 
graduates around the stage his speciality is a swoon from the 
stage he plunges some 8 feet into the pit 
so far i havent been hurt says the performer knocking on 
the makeup table for luck in his st james dressing room but dont 
worry his dive is cushioned by a thick mat that covers the floor of 
the pit he also wears kneepads and elbow pads 
gordon jumps with the expertise of a high diver which is what he 
was in school back at allegheny college in meadville pa he was a 
fourtime allamerican springboard diver and an ncaa division iii 
national champion 
but what do you do after you get a degree in sociology and find 
that jobs are scarce 
i became a clown says the 35yearold gordon who grew up in 
pittsburgh 
he was tending bar on the delta queen the famous riverboat that 
still makes the journey up and down the mississippi river on the 
boat he met several clowns who had worked with the ringling bros 
and barnum amp bailey circus 
they inspired him to apply for the circuss clown college in 
sarasota fla 
i had an advantage over other applicants gordon says i 
was a little older and already had gymnastics but the training in 
sarasota was incredibly rigorous 
at the school gordon learned clown makeup how to sew his own 
costume and to create his own clown character as well studying the 
history of circuses and the fine art of clowning 
after graduating gordon got a job jumping over elephants in the 
red unit one of two troupes ringling sends out to tour the country 
it was hard work there were 11 shows a week nearly half of them 
packed into a weekend gordon did that for a year before leaving and 
joining the big apple circus in new york in 1981 
the ringling bros circus was a threering circus gordon 
says the big apple circus is one ring and much more focused it 
uses changes in lighting and music to create a mood rather than 
spectacle 
in the big apple circus each performer gets a featured spot 
according to gordon and because of this individual focus the 
audience is drawn into the show rather than overwhelmed by three 
rings of action 
for the big apple circus gordon created a special very physical 
rednosed clown who talks in monosyllables his name is gordoon a 
variation on his creators last name 
talking is not one of his featured talents but hes been known 
to lipsync to the supremes gordon adds gordoon is like my 
best pal since ive been in largely new york i havent played 
him in about five months and i miss him 
but the performer says he is still working on new routines for 
his clown character 
i have a little idea book i keep by my bed gordon says i 
always jot down these seemingly silly ideas they tend to pile up 
and influence one another and something comes out of that 
there are basically three kinds of clowns he explains a 
whitefaced clown who is more of an effete a kind of a straight 
man an auguste clown who is a bumbler and does a lot of 
slapstick like gordoon and a character clown like a hobo or a 
little old lady 
it was at the big apple circus that irwin first saw gordon 
perform he later cast him in various productions of largely new 
york as it made its way from a new york workshop to seattle to 
washington and on to broadway 
because of his success in largely new york gordon has 
received some interest from film and television people 
but there will always be a place in my heart for clowning 
gordon says but i want to work if that means working on 
broadway doing physical comedy film or commercial work ill do 
it it feels good to be versatile and a lot of that i learned in the 
circus

colombia has lived in bloodshed almost constantly 
since its founding in 1819 and these days the violence is laced with 
cocaine and common crime as well as ideology but while most of its 
south american neighbors struggle for economic survival colombia is 
striding forward even though it is again at war with itself this is 
one of a series of periodic reports by the associated press on the 
economic social and political turbulence that has turned south 
america into a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a simultaneous struggle with 
guerrillas rightwing vigilantes drug smugglers and assassins 
colombia resolutely survives 
to an extent it even thrives 
the withering crossfire of violence invites predictions of 
national perdition but a country accustomed to decades of 
bloodletting goes about its politics and business 
in general terms the state not only functions it functions 
better every day said pierre gilodes director of the foreign 
ministrys institute for higher developmental studies 
we dont know if this is a paradox or if there is some 
relationship between what is happening in the country and the 
efficient functioning of the state 
in an interview with the associated press gilodes said he 
suspects a kind of perversely positive relationship exists 
the state is pushed to function well or it will collapse 
said gilodes a french expert contracted by the government to head 
the institute 
the actions of shadowy rightwing groups may help keep some 
dissent stifled he added 
the state can decide that salaries will go up less than the 
cost of living and no one protests 
unions that would or should raise their voices are under 
pressure from private groups that kill labor activists 
in addition he said leftist guerrilla and rightwing violence 
in the countryside is steadily driving both poor and welltodo to 
the cities to help fuel the more productive urbanbased industries 
with seed money and cheap labor 
colombias gross national product of about 42 billion grew 37 
percent last year lower than the recent annual average but enviable 
to most struggling latin american countries annual inflation is 28 
percent a fraction of that of neighboring nations 
new factories go up daily and with healthy tax revenues the 
government regularly builds new roads and launches other public 
works projects 
illegal cocaine earnings bring home an estimated 500 milllion to 
12 billion a year and is believed responsible for perhaps 
onefifth of the countrys eonomic growth last year 
but gilodes insists drugs can hardly be called the economic 
engine for a country whose 6 billion in legal yearly exports 
include coffee oil coal and an evermore diverse array of 
nontraditional products such as flowers he attributes the success 
to many years of prudent management of a sound freemarket 
economy 
on the political side preliminary campaigning for congressional 
and municipal elections next march and presidential balloting in may 
is already under way nobody expects any big hitches 
democracy is even broadening its base absenteeism at the polls 
is shrinking each year and the country recently celebrated the 
first anniversary of the election of the countrys 1009 mayors who 
used to be appointed all political and social camps declared the 
experiment a great success 
colombia also thrives culturally with nightly performances of 
plays symphonies and popular music for a people who love to dance 
and can easily distinguish the beat of an inland rumba from a 
coastal cumbia 
fueled by the works of latin americas most popular living 
novelist gabriel garcia marquez colombias book industry is 
booming a national poetry contest in the industrial city of 
medellin the dark heart of cocaine country drew an enthusiastic 
crowd of 7000 people a love poem won 
to a visitor the countrys troubles the machinegun fire and car 
bombs can seem nonexistent or distant or quickly absorbed in the 
bustle of an exuberant people like a grenade lobbed in thick jungle 
on may 27 on a major bogota thoroughfare 220 pounds of 
explosive went off as the chief of the countrys security police 
gen miguel maza marquez was passing in his car he was just 
bruised but seven passersby were mortally wounded 
within a few hours the rubble had been swept up and life was 
back to normal 
but then in colombia death is measured by the dozen 
killings this year totaled 9411 as of early june an average 60 
a day according to national police department statistics 
that is down from a daily average of 66 last year when killings 
totaled 24280 eight times the total of 2924 in california which 
has 28 million inhabitants to colombias 31 million most adult 
colombian males are said to die by the knife gun or garrotte 
most of the deaths are what police call common homicides 
unrelated to politics but among this years victims were 67 
politicians and 86 policemen in the last eight months the 
government insurance company has paid off death benefits to the 
families of 771 armed forces members and 15 court officials 
the police even keep a statistic for mass killings involving 
five or more victims there have been 34 so far this year with a 
total of 175 victims 
occasionally there is a sign that even expansive colombia is 
having trouble absorbing death in such big numbers 
in the community called palestina on the cauca river not far 
from the city of manizales authorities complained that the town 
graveyard cant handle all the unclaimed bulletriddled corpses 
being pulled from the river according to a dispatch in the bogota 
newpspaper la prensa it said 120 bodies had been found since late 
last year 
the countrys sources of violence are manifold

a variety of leftist guerrilla organizations have been active in 
colombia since the late 1950s and are blamed for 660 deaths so far 
in 1989 their domain includes expanses of littlepatrolled and 
sparsely populated territory where they impose taxes and draft 
recruits 
they also are prone to kidnapping for ransom as are many common 
criminals nationwide an average of two kidnappings are reported to 
police each day 
the cocaine business which surged in the early 1980s when the 
american streets and parlors became its biggest customer makes a 
substantial contribution to the death toll in deals gone sour and 
struggles for power 
more recently a new and fearsome element of violence has reared 
up the rightwing death squad fed by cocaine money and linked to 
government security organs and a dark society of sicarios the 
spanish term for killers for hire 
its victims include not only leftist politicians and government 
investigators but ragged tramps homosexuals prostitutes and street 
urchins in a process euphemistically called social cleansing 
allegations abound that the highest spheres of government have 
been infiltrated bought off or terrified into at least reluctant 
compliance with the drug bosses wishes but the government 
dismisses such allegations 
to reinforce its argument it points to continued attempts to 
assassinate and intimidate top justice and police officials 
president virgilio barco repeatedly has called the narcotics 
traffickers and rightwing death squads dangerous enemies of the 
state and he contends that recent police actions have hurt them 
badly 
violence is a mortally wounded beast he declared after the 
carbomb attack on maza marquez which he characterized as the 
lashingout of an angry animal 
in a recent conversation with reporters barco said there are 
judases everywhere but that doesnt mean this is a corrupt country 
the government the armed forces the police are more prepared 
each day to control crime in this country he said 
about 30 percent of colombians endure poverty according to 
official estimates the poverty stands in sharp contrast to economic 
advancement a beggar outside an exclusive mens store in bogota or 
on the road to the caribbean resort city of cartagena where local 
and foreign tourists pack fivestar hotels and beaches a ragged 
peasant strips whats left on the bones of a cow killed by a motor 
vehicle 
such misery is said to feed the ranks of leftist guerrilla 
groups but the government also claims some progress on that front 
one major guerrilla organization the april 19 movement is 
engaged in direct talks with the government on how its members might 
lay down their arms and join the political process some other 
groups including the biggest the revolutionary armed forces of 
colombia have expressed an interest in joining what is called the 
peace process 
this represents a big change in guerrilla attitudes compared 
with the 1970s when they believed they could take power by force 
said carlos jaramillo a government political scientist 
jaramillo is an assistant to the presidential counsel on the 
peace process rafael pardo many colombians view the talks with 
skepticism but jaramillo insisted the time is ripe for an accord 
guerrillas have been frustrated in decades of effort to extend their 
control to important urban centers he said 
the guerrilla has been unable to change his marginal status 
he added 
jaramillo said that overall the violence in colombia gives the 
impression of intensifying 
youre always saying it cant get any worse and then 
something worse happens 
but he contended it must be viewed within the context of 
virtually constant bloodshed since the countrys founding in 1819 
the country has lived through periods of much worse violence 
he said 
from 1830 to the turn of the century colombia endured 50 bloody 
local or national conflicts and in a period called la 
violencia roughly from 1948 to 1959 victims of a largely rural 
conflict between the traditional liberal and conservative parties 
were counted by the truckload estimates of the total number of dead 
in that decade of violence range from 70000 to 300000 
jaramillo said he detects a new willingness in many sectors of 
the country to attack and defeat all sources of violence be they 
from the right or the left 
its as if weve said well now weve touched bottom he said

colombias powerful cocaine chieftans 
such as fabio ochoa gonzalo rodriguez gacha and pablo escobar 
gaviria are known by name all across the country yet they remain 
at large seemingly immune from arrest and prosecution 
despite heavy us pressure for their capture and extradition on 
smuggling charges the biggest often seem to slip away from any 
attempt to capture and hold them 
they are said to pay informants in security forces and the 
courts those they cannot bribe they try to intimidate with death 
threats that are not idle their victims include justice minister 
rodrigo lara bonilla killed in 1984 and attorney general carlos 
hoyos assassinated last year 
in an interview colombias national police chief maj gen 
miguel gomez badilla said he receives threats daily by mail and 
telephone but insists the forces of order and justice are not cowed 
he said the drug bosses are being aggressively persecuted if not 
prosecuted 
escobar gacha ochoa these people are fugitives they are 
being hunted gomez said 
while they are in their own territory its hard to catch them 
why because there are many people who make their living off them 
and who protect them 
but remember there was a time when pablo escobar was 
considered a robin hood in certain sections of medellin where he 
financed housing churches recreation areas gomez said he cant 
do that anymore he has to hide 
gomez formerly chief of the forces antinarcotics division is 
considered a top name on the hitlist of the cocaine smugglers and 
rightwing death squads he is constantly accompanied by heavily 
armed bodyguards and his wifes and five childrens movements are 
restricted 
he also faces an internal enemy the ranks of his 80000member 
force have been aggressively purged with 1353 policemen expelled 
in the last 18 months for alleged links to narcotics or the 
private justice groups as the death squads call themselves 
i cant deny that there are police linked to narcotics 
trafficking but we are uncovering them gomez said 
he added that said secuirity forces had delivered several 
decisive blows in recent months to the cocaine cartels and death 
squads in one case dismantling a lab that held 11000 pounds of the 
powder and striking at several training camps for hired gunmen 
at the camps authorities find hefty arsenals of the latest in 
weaponry including rocket and grenade launchers shiny new assault 
rifles automatic pistols silencers to police and the military it 
is a fearsome byproduct of the drug industry 
the cocaine goes out of the country and the profits return in 
the form of weapons which can be sold at five or ten times their 
purchase price gomez said 
he said the government of president virgilio barco however has 
increased spending on sophisticated equipment for the armed forces 
and police 
the united states has helped with 10 million in antinarcotics

when this city of 350000 goes to bed 
it is time for sister stephany and father henry to load bread and 
plastic jugs full of hot milk onto their pickup truck and set out 
into the night 
they go in search of the hundreds of children whose only home is 
the streets 
a third of the children they will find some as young as 5 are 
cocainepaste addicts or sniffers of glue or gasoline others have 
been abandoned by their parents or come from homes of unemployed 
workers where there is not enough food many survive by selling 
cigarettes laced with cocainepaste or by petty thievery 
at least 2000 children and youths roam the streets of this 
prosperous city booming from the cocaine produced in the chapare 
subtropical region 110 miles to the northeast where 80 percent of 
the coca leaf grown in bolivia is processed into cocaine 
when sister stephany murray 68 who was born in emmittsburg 
md and the rev patrick henry 47 of omaha neb find the 
children they pass out the bread and the hot milk in plastic cups 
distributing milk gives us a chance to make contact with them 
and make them feel we are indeed interested in them and they are not 
outcasts of society sister stephany said it is a friendly 
contact if they are on drugs we try to tell them they can do better 
and we are ready to receive them when they are ready to come 
she and father henry as everyone calls him operate two roman 
catholic amanecer dawn shelters for homeless youths 
sister stephany a member of the st vincent de paul order has 
been working in cochabamba for 25 years 
father henry is on leave from the roman catholic archdiocese of 
omaha to work as a maryknoll missionary in cochabamba he has been 
here five years 
they said they distribute bread and milk to 150 to 200 children 
two nights a week 
some of the kids leave home because there is nothing to eat 
sister stephany said in an interview they start shining shoes 
they lose contact with their families and they find it easier to 
steal or sell cigarettes laced with cocaine paste 
organizations that work with homeless youths say the number of 
street kids and cases of youth drug addiction in cochabamba and 
other cities have increased in the last five years chiefly because 
of bolivias economic difficulties and the availability of drugs 
unemployment is more than 20 percent 35000 government workers 
have been laid off in the last five years as part of the 
governments austerity program and according to the united nations 
childrens fund 45 percent of rural children suffer from 
malnutrition 
the amanecer centers provide provide temporary lodging for street 
kids along with rehabilitation and training programs 
just about everybody on the streets has used drugs and 
practically all of them have had involvement in drug trafficking 
father henry said 
several of the youths interviewed at an amanecer shelter said 
they had worked in the cocaineproducing chapare region they told 
of being arrested by police and taken to a labor camp for drug 
offenders in chapare at least five youths have died in the last two 
years at the camp under suspicious circumstances father henry said 
children in the chapare transport chemicals while their parents 
as well as youths macerate coca leaves into cocaine with the first 
priority being to provide food to live on said laura baldivieso 
a psychologist and head of the usfinanced drug information 
center but the chapare instead of resolving the economic 
problems of the unemployed is contributing to a deterioration of 
the family and the social structure 
many of the kids who come to our center have tread on coca 
leaves in the chapare father henry said they are paid 20 a 
night to stomp on coca leaves and often part of the payment is in 
the form of paste 
many youths arrive from the chapare with festering wounds or ill 
with parasiteborne diseases yellow fever or tuberculosis father 
henry said 
they become exhausted from working all night and for lack of 
food he added 
five years ago people would say that drugs were a north 
american problem they cant say it anymore because drug use has 
become so much more widespread and there is cocaine everywhere 
after midnight on el prado a treelined avenue bordered by 
restaurants and snack shops quechua and aymaraspeaking indian 
children roam the streets often selling pastelaced cigarettes for 
traffickers to people from all social classes 
police cars sometimes stop to question them but sister stephany 
said they often threaten to take the children to jail unless they 
hand over money usually the equivalent of 5 
street kids tell me if i dont have the money i will be 
mistreated so i better have enough and this encourages stealing 
she said 
although it is illegal to put a child in jail the organization 
defense for childreninternational says dozens of children are 
rounded up every night and kept overnight or several days without 
food or blankets in dark and filthy jail cells along hardened 
criminals 
at its base the cocaine and street kid problem in cochabamba 
is an economic one father henry said unfortunately there is no 
industry that can take up the slack if cocaine stopped it would be 
an overwhelming switch to have all these people come back from the 
chapare when there are no jobs there are people who are desperate 
and are living a very thin line they wont get rich but at least 
they will feed their families

health activists fear aids is 
spreading rapidly among brazils estimated 7 million street kids 
they complain authorities are doing little to stop it 
these children have frequent sexual contact as prostitutes and 
with each other said flavio braune wiik of the brazilian 
interdisciplinary aids association in rio de janeiro most dont 
know what condoms are or how to use them and they have almost no 
access to health care 
of course its spreading 
brazil with 6421 confirmed aids cases overall through april of 
this year is the worlds no 3 aids country after the united states 
and france 
official figures which activists fear may be low indicate that 
140000 youngsters living in the streets are infected with the virus 
the situation is especially troubling in rio de janeiro with 
more than 1 million street kids the highest number in the country 
and 705 confirmed cases of aids 
the government spends very little on aids prevention programs 
of any kind said wiik and it has almost no special projects 
for street kids who have little access to official campaigns 
the first aids case was reported in brazil in 1983 but until 
early 1987 the government did not place a priority on combating the 
virus arguing that malaria tuberculosis chagas disease and 
numerous other maladies affected more people and thus deserved 
higher priority 
finally though the government launched an antiaids campaign 
with public posters and television messages telling of the perils of 
aids and discussing preventive measures 
but wiik said the campaign is almost completely ineffective in 
reaching street kids 
even children who live at home dont learn much about aids from 
the ads because they appear only late at night he said in an 
interview how are street kids supposed to see them if they dont 
have television 
wiik added that the language in the ads was sterilized due to 
protests from conservatives and roman catholic church leaders 
these kids dont know what sperm or anal sex are he 
said they only know street talk 
making matters worse an unprecedented economic crisis with 
inflation running at around 1000 percent annually has led to budget 
cutbacks in many social programs 
the program for the control of aids an agency of the health 
ministry had its 1989 budget cut by 30 percent to only 104 
million that has left the problem of combatting aids largely on the 
shoulders of state and local governments and volunteer 
organizations and they have even less money in their budges than 
federal authorities 
wiik said the aids association which produces educational 
materials on aids for groups that work with street kids runs the 
only program of its type in this country of 144 million people 
the problem of controlling the spread of aids among street kids 
is difficult because to the life they lead 
drug use especially cocaine is widespread but most street 
youths in brazil do not inject drugs activists say so the spread 
of the aids virus via contaminated needles is not common 
the bigger problem is sex 
most boys on the streets earn their money by stealing begging or 
prostitution juvenile court files indicate but according to 
activists the only real option for girls on the streets is 
prostitution 
girls as young as 9 and 10 often work as prostitutes sometimes 
for a plate of food said vera lucia fernandes de souza a 
street kids educator with a program organized by the mayors 
office in rio de janeiro 
many street children also have sex with their companions as well 
further increasing the risk of infection 
many know little about aids or sex ms souza said ive 
had girls who were pregnant and thought they caught it like a 
cold and educational work is extremely difficult its hard enough 
for street kids to remember what time it is let alone to use a 
condom which they dont have money to buy in any case 
adding to the problem she said is the terrible toll street life 
takes on the youths 
without a real home food or family many of these kids think 
life has no meaning anyway they have no hopes for the future so 
they dont think about tomorrow 
street kids who live at largo do machado a public plaza on rios 
south side showed little concern when interviewed about contracting 
the aids virus 
luis who said he was 14 but looks about 12 said he has 
burglarized homes and admitted he had worked as a prostitute to 
support himself he had heard about aids he said but didnt use 
condoms nor did he know anyone who did 
im not afraid of dying or anything else he said i wasnt 
born to live forever and i have to eat 
luis said he visits his mother in a slum neighborhood several 
hours from downtown rio every sunday 
i tell her i sell stuff on the street and beg so she doesnt 
worry 
jose an 18yearold who has lived on the street for five 
years said aids will kill you but im going to die one day 
anyway 
and if he knew he had aids would he stop any type of sexual 
activity 
no id probably play around more to die sooner

back when television was in diapers milton berle 
was in a dress it was a kinder world then despite his wardrobe he 
became known as mr television 
fortyone years after the debut of texaco star theater berle 
wears suits for his rare tv appearances he smokes big cigars 
cuban jobs the size of cucumbers and he has a million memories and 
monologues gleaned from a career stretching from vaudeville to video 
berle didnt anticipate such success when he moved from the 
movies remember sun valley serenade to the small screen on 
june 8 1948 
the power nobody knew the power of television i didnt i 
swear i didnt said the man known to millions as uncle miltie 
when he was televisions undisputed king holding millions of 
americans hostage in their living rooms each tuesday night 
the texaco show of 40 years ago there were no laugh machines 
if the joke bombed you died recalled berle in town to pitch 
milton berle the second time around a threetape video 
collection of texaco clips 
thats why i used to say leave a 9 oclock wakeup call for 
the audience or heres another one you may not care for but 
thats all gone unfortunate 
while berle was televisions first major star time called him 
a strange new phenomenon modesty and the chance for a cheap 
joke prevents him from claiming he was the one behind its creation 
i didnt start it all berle said in an interview 
pause remove cigar punchline 
it had to be invented first 
dadumdum 
uncle miltie at 80 may wear thick pancake makeup and pitch 
underwear on television but he still has a keen mind and an 
incredible recall of names dates and places 
an hourlong chat with berle includes tales of his days and 
nights in the havana madrid 51st between seventh and broadway 
daves blue room right on 52nd street and the 500 club in 
atlantic city owned by a guy named damato 
and he can drop some names elvis presley frank sinatra jerry 
lewis danny thomas walter huston talullah bankhead basil 
rathbone berles worked with them all he also remembers working 
with a guy named dino crosetti from stubenville ohio 
i said dinos a good name but theres got to be an easier 
name something like dean kramer or dean morton or dean martin 
said berle thats how he got the name 
martin and lewis were later guests on texaco star theater 
which dominated all competition in the late 1940s and early 50s an 
estimated 90 percent of americas sets were tuned to uncle miltie 
when he was on 
berle began his career at age 5 starting out in a silent movie 
dubbed tillies punctured romance even then he worked with the 
big names the film starred charlie chaplin 
by age 12 berle was on broadway he appeared in more than 50 
silent films he did vaudeville he played the catskills and then 
after 35 years in the business berle went video 
he later went on to other variety shows appearing on the kraft 
music hall in the late 50s and serving as host for the milton 
berle show in the 60s he never gave up live performing after 
years of playing in las vegas he now plays twice a year in atlantic 
city and lake tahoe 
last year he starred with fellow veterans danny thomas and sid 
caesar in a madefortelevision flick called side by side his 
current tv spots are as a pitchman for underwear in which he 
confesses at my age ive done just about everything in my bvds 
hes also written a couple of books a selftitled 1974 
autobiography and bs i love you a collection of jokes and 
gags picked up during his long association with the friars club 
i get interviews where people say milton thats a helluva 
risk you took i said it was but it wasnt not with the acts i 
had i used to book the best acts available berle recalled 
and i told em dont worry about the cameras theyll catch 
you 
today berle doesnt watch much tv debates sports 2020 
and 60 minutes and oneil whats that mcneillehrer so i 
dont watch 
but with television marking its 50th anniversary berles role in 
the medium has again been spolighted along with his dresswearing 
antics the berle legacy includes a reputation as a jokesnatcher 
the thief of bad gags the great columnist walter winchell once 
called him berle maintains he started this himself as a publicity 
scam 
and the dresses 
too long a story on that said berle glancing quickly at two 
female publicists in the room ill tell you alone 
berle is winding down when hes asked about the first night of 
texaco who was on the show he pauses removes his wellchewed 
stogie and looks straight ahead going back 41 years in 15 seconds 
june 8 1948 said uncle miltie pausing again sophie 
tucker and a dance team they were wonderful dont know if you 
ever saw them the zoneys a brothersister team didnt speak to 
each other fought like cats and dogs a great harmonica artist 
stan fisher and bandleader is everybody happy ted lewis 
berle remembers all the guests he also remembers the immediate 
overwhelming reaction his show produced 
the next day i walked out of my house on 88th street took a 
cab to the friars for lunch i decided to walk the last few blocks 
i walked a couple of blocks and the people were all following me 
the great entertainer said 
i never knew so many people saw the show that night it was the 
next day thats how quickly the instantaneous value of that 
was very remarkable 
one show

she was once an enfant terrible of modern dance 
and later became one of the most famous choreographers to emerge 
from avantgarde dance today twyla tharp is a little more 
traditonal she works for a ballet company im an oldwest 
pioneer type person you just have to examine where your fences are 
built i have no fences i have open spaces i dont like 
categorizing people or dancing except into good or bad the 
48yearold choreographer says 
tharp who choreographed for her own modern dance company and the 
movies hair ragtime amadeus and white nights 
joined american ballet theater last summer and never one to move 
in mincing steps she presented three new dances on the same night 
during ballet theaters current season at the metropolitan opera 
i like setting new challenges for myself she said in an 
interview the work has all been done since august with the paris 
opera ballet thrown in 
the choreographer dissolved twyla tharp dance last july and she 
and eight or nine dancers about half her troupe joined abt i 
wouldnt have disbanded and not worked she says you never go 
from somewhere to nowhere 
the reason for giving up her own company she says was economic 
the company was very well run we didnt have a deficit we had 
done over six months of touring a year for two years in a row not 
many dancers were enthusiastic about that my fundraising became 
more and more a concern i had less and less time in a studio new 
work wasnt happening 
she hasnt had a day off since august when youre working as 
hard as i am a day off doesnt help im willing to kill myself and 
everybody else to get it right but the work since august has been 
creating new ballets 
first she choreographed bums rush balletic vaudeville then 
worked on everlast presented like a 1920s musical comedy with 
the lively plot told in dance and three singers and a pianist 
onstage performing appropriate jerome kern songs she started 
quartet in neoclassical ballet style before she finished 
everlast 
when ballet theater took time off and before she finished 
quartet she created rules of the game for the paris opera 
ballet she flew back to the united states finished quartet 
flew back to paris and found her leading ballerina sylvie guillem 
had left the company for the british royal ballet so she rewrote 
world premieres kept her hopping quartet in chicago feb 4 
bums rush in chicago feb 8 rules of the game in paris 
feb 17 and everlast in san francisco march 2 
about differences between modern dance and ballet tharp is 
emphatic 
as far as im concerned theyre nonexistent since george 
balanchine made agon to me the determining factor is not whether 
the dancers are in bare feet it is the welding of dance tradition 
with innovational movement and concept and perception about what 
society is and how it functions she said i think there was not 
enough real choice being exerted by modern choreographers given 
that choice this whole issue disappeared 
she first choreographed for a ballet company in 1973 when she 
used beach boys recordings for the joffrey ballet a jazzy push 
comes to shove in 1976 was her first dance for mikhail 
baryshnikov now artistic director of ballet theater 
about everlast she says its a fully developed narrative 
it has a boxer who begins in love with the wrong girl and ends up 
with the right girl through the advice of several characters in the 
plot 
the jerome kern songs were around they were written for 
shows need a song where the ingenue falls for the guy here are 50 
of those it had to be the right one of the 50 in terms of how it 
registered in the overall flow of this piece 
both quartet to terry riley music and in the upper 
room which tharp choreographed for her own company in 1986 and 
which ballet theater danced here for the first time this season are 
plotless but for tharp nothing is really plotless 
balanchine thought there is a narrative in everything center 
stage is a different place than upstage left who appears in those 
places and at what time tells a story 
she said in the upper room isnt meant to be biblical its 
an abstract plot its about completion the way things reinforce 
one another growth and development 
whether audiences could verbalize what it means or not i dont 
think is important i think one of the reasons the piece is so 
popular is that people feel it makes a constructive and positive 
statement if you make an investment it will be returned in kind 
with interest 
in the upper room is set to philip glass music which tharp 
has been using for 20 years she wanted to call it glass and 
sometimes does in conversation but because jerome robbins 
choreogaphed glass pieces for the new york city ballet the 
composer chose a different name 
in rules of the game the dance she choreographed for the 
paris opera ballet the rules of the theatrical game was what i 
was attempting to express she said this season after some 
experiences id had i began to feel i understood some rules of some 
games i set about to build on them rather than avantgarde 
fashion start from nowhere 
she fought leaving the avantgarde she says but at a certain 
point you have to acknowledge ive learned some things and here 
they are 
the reason im interested in these rules of the game is theyve 
been lost to some degree since jerry robbins stopped working in 
theater young people dont know how to structure they dont have 
access to the rules the game hasnt been played in a very long time 
the avantgarde is everybody trying to be smarter than what 
works perfectly well a lot of the time i went through it as long 
as possible 
a piece looking avantgarde never has been my concern my 
concern has always been to do something of quality that would have 
some impact if it stayed around or influenced something ive 
never been one just for shock value

nearly 13 years ago the sinister cackle of young 
johnny rotten kicked off anarchy in the uk and the brief 
remarkable history of the sex pistols 
all were trying to do is destroy everything the singer 
boasted at the time and the punk band made music that lived up to 
his words 
such songs as holidays in the sun pretty vacant and 
god save the queen were an enraged response to the complacent 
mainstream rock of the mid1970s and opened the way for the clash 
gang of four and elvis costello 
the sex pistols made just one album before breaking up rotten 
quickly distanced himself from his old band reverting to his 
original name john lydon and forming public image ltd which had 
a danceable sound that drew upon a wide variety of music 
public image ltd has been more durable if less exciting than 
the sex pistols and has just released 9 its ninth album the 
current lineup consists of lydon guitarist john mcgeoch drummer 
bruce smith and bassist allan dias 
with a 10th record already in mind lydon was in a jovial mood 
during a recent interview offering his opinions on music and 
movies success and failure politics and donahue 
rock n roll 
ive always liked music and ive always thought hmm maybe i 
should be doing something like this because these really arent the 
records i wanted to hear so when the chance came along i jumped to 
it both feet straight into the deep end 
country singer kd lang 
i think what she does for country music and sound is wonderful 
absolutely new ive always perceived country music as being dead 
from the head down but i like her songs very much 
pop star debbie gibson 
lifes too short to be telling lies while the debbie gibsons 
of the world are being pumped out its very difficult its all 
factory programmed if you toe the line and compromise life will be 
very easy for you but ultimately very unsatisfying too many famous 
people lead terrible lifestyles because of that 
the influence of african music 
i saw the connection it fit in perfectly with my own irish 
folk culture irish folk music does relate very much to bulgarian 
which relates to turkey which relates to the arab all the way 
around going into morocco back up through spain again marvelous 
the sex pistols 
it got very very stale and i had to call it quits it was the 
pistols then its public image now i always offer an alternative 
the film sid and nancy which depicted the life of sex 
pistols bassist sid vicious 
to be misrepresented so badly was a great disappointment 
director alex cox never communicated with any of the pistols not 
even the manager at that time none of us so how on earth can you 
present that film as a semidocumentary 
it was like fantasy island gone wrong how can you use 
someone like joe strummer and iggy pop as research what do they 
know about the workings of the pistols nothing you might as well 
have asked liberace and probably would have achieved better 
results 
performing drunk 
i put that down to inexperience not having respect for myself 
going on stage drunk is a tragedy i did do that a few times because 
i was so bloody nervous the end result was a shambles 
apologies folks for those bad old days but there werent too 
many of them 
nonviolence 
if you want to destroy a government its very easy just lay 
down your tools all at once the country will collapse overnight 
the minute you have to kill people for a cause you have no 
cause you immediately show you have no respect for human life 
theres no real need for it we can change this planet gandhi 
proved that 
failure 
before every gig im absolutely terrified completely i want 
every show to be the ultimate once im on then im fine you know 
home run but that build up bloody dreadful 
music video 
ive had some wonderful fantasies in my life i envisioned 
myself as operating this video company i realized after three weeks 
i loathed video i cannot stand it i dont like watching it these 
are poloroids theyre trivial i dont like fiddling about with 
cameras 
lyrics 
people dont actually listen to the songs theyre dancing to 
i had to listen to every single word used i just liked 
language its our major achievement as a species 
songwriting 
on a lot of my songs i just sit down and write it line after 
line after line i keep running the ideas through my head and 
finally the best way of doing it just occurs to me quite naturally 
his public image bandmates 
if you cant get on with people theres no point i dont care 
about looks i care about personality some sense of musical 
innovation im not interested in some sort of manufactured pop or 
set organized musical things that bores me 
phil donahues hair 
you cant tell me thats not a wig you can see it on the back 
of his head most wig manufacturers are pretty sophisticated but 
phil isnt 
imitators 
dont imitate me dont ever imitate me that would not be a 
form of flattery at all that would be worse than being in a heavy 
metal band

picture a 6foot3 railthin author whose heroes 
include bruce springsteen washington irving and james beard 
imagine a rock n roll gourmet and prizewinning novelist who 
dreams of making literature as entertaining as music television as 
profound as a mans search for his lost father 
summing up the work of t coraghessan boyle is as easy as apple 
pie or perhaps hazelnut dacquoise start with a generous sample of 
absurdist humor for instance modern love the story of a man 
a woman and some very safe sex or hard sell in which the 
ayatollah finds salvation in threepiece suits and baseball 
add a legend or two 
recreate the events that led to the death of blues pioneer robert 
johnson and name the story after two of his greatest songs 
stones in my passway hellhound on my trail or take the 
grandson of robert jordan hero in for whom the bell tolls 
nickname him cup of soup and send him to fight the contras in 
nicaragua 
throw in a dash of americana combine the lives of indians and 
dutch settlers in the 17th century the tragic 1949 anticommunist 
riots in peekskill ny and a contemporary love quadrangle among 
hippies and yuppies and you have boyles acclaimed novel worlds 
end winner of the penfaulkner award in 1988 
top it off with the deepest heartbreak imagine an alcoholic 
unable to save his marraige who dreams he is too helpless to keep 
his son from drowning whose favorite lyric provides the title for 
boyles latest collection of short stories if the river was 
whiskey viking 1795 
what ive learned from experience is that anything can be a 
story boyle said i dont see things in terms of limitations i 
dont care if someone says thats not realistic or thats too 
preposterous or that was in the newspaper 
anything can mean president eisenhower and the wife of soviet 
leader nikita khrushchev in a whirlwind romance or a woman leaving 
her husband for the love of a chimpanzee or the seduction of a 
cynical restaurant critic by taglierini alla pizzaiola with homemade 
fennel sausage and chopped tomatoes 
its kind of a way of looking at the world and making an absurd 
joke he said i guess from the beginning i didnt want to write 
strict realistic stories ninety percent of what i do has been 
comic even if its grimly comic like worlds end 
boyle born in 1948 had no interest in writing at all while 
growing up in peekskill ny uninspired by fingerpainting and music 
classes his hobbies included watching television and reading comics 
unfortunately creative writing wasnt emphasized in the 
schools when i was as kid boyle recalled i didnt know 
anything about it until i was a junior in college state university 
of new yorkpotsdam i thought it might be fun it wasnt fun but 
i found i was addicted to it and very good at it 
in 1972 boyle enrolled in the writers workshop at the 
university of iowa taking classes with john cheever and john irving 
among others he submitted descent of man a collection of short 
stories as his phd dissertation and the book was eventually 
published in 1979 
he began as a cult writer a wellkept secret whose audiences 
greeted his stories like fans at a heavy metal concert after 
another set of short stories greasy lake and a pair of novels 
water music and budding prospects boyle tapped into a wide 
readership with worlds end 
i wanted to address the fact that i pretty much ignored the 
history of the area i grew up in in elementary school we talked 
about the history of the revolutionary war but you didnt get the

history is a version boyle said the actual facts are a 
version who was there what ax do they have to grind whose party

fiction is maybe a more imaginative version you can get into

highway 101 the hottest vocal band in 
country music took its name after roads in california and minnesota 
and its style from the pop group fleetwood mac 
the fourpiece band voted group of the year in 1988 and 1989 by 
the academy of country music formed in california in the mid1980s 
with the idea of becoming the fleetwood mac of country music 
highway 101 hasnt sold 15 million albums like fleetwood macs 
rumours but the energy of its music and the vocals of paulette 
carlson have drawn comparisons to fleetwood macs stevie nicks and 
christine mcvie 
in a rapid rise to the top in country music highway 101 has 
turned out three no 1 records do you love me just say yes last 
september cry cry cry in 1988 and somewhere tonight in 
1987 
four other singles made the top 10 of the country charts the 
bands two albums highway 101 and highway 101 2 also did 
well they performed 140 concerts last year doing shows with 
country stars such as hank williams jr the judds and reba mcentire 
i think it was the right time for a band situation like this 
said highway 101 guitarist jack daniels we have kind of a style 
an approach thats carefree and dynamic as opposed to playing it 
safe and smooth and slick 
said lead guitarist curtis stone it was definitely a musical 
adventure we all participated in 
scott cactus moser the bands drummer rounds out the four 
the men are all from the los angeles area and carlson is from 
minnesota calling both tiny winsted and equally small moose lake 
her home 
borrowing from roads in their home states the four decided to 
call themselves highway 101 
it was the link between the guys on the west coast and paulette 
in minnesota said daniels but in our travels weve seen 
several others in the country its sort of a network 
all four members had solid professional experience before forming 
highway 101 moser had played drums for johnny rivers jennifer 
warnes and others daniels hit the road at age 17 with country 
performer freddie hart carlson had recording experience as a solo 
singer stone the son of a song publisher had written songs for 
crystal gayle juice newton and others 
we had put in time in various other bands stone said i 
think we paid our dues individually 
just as the band was getting together moser and stone even 
appeared briefly in the movie back to school with rodney 
dangerfield and did the soundtrack to the film 
i sang the first verse to twist and shout and cactus played 
the drums stone said rodney took the mike away from me and 
that was about it 
their configuration is unique among country music recording 
artists a woman lead singer who also plays guitar with three 
accompanying musicians who share vocal responsibilities 
its helped stone said of the arrangement were the first 
band that did it were the first that had a female singer 
said daniels we are all musicians and all singers its 
nebulous why it all works if anyone knew the answer everyone would 
be lining up doing it 
we did a few things experimentally to find our groove our 
niche it wasnt necessarily what would sell to the public it was 
what do we do best together it took us a little bit to discover 
that once we did we felt good with it and fortunately people 
liked that 
when we first came out other musicians said we were playing 
raw energy i think that sometimes music gets homogenized in the 
recording process to be clean and safe it loses its humanism our 
records were more live sounding 
stone agrees 
theres a lot of spontaneous things that happen in our music 
that you dont hear a lot on record elsewhere 
theres a goodnatured tiff among the group about numbering their 
albums the guys think its clever but carlson doesnt 
we went with highway 101 2 and got a lot of flak from 
paulette stone said but we thought it was pretty cute because 
it could be highway 101 2 highway 101 squared highway 101 to the 
second power whatever you want to say but shes adamant about 
fighting it

time inc has begun its campaign to woo 
shareholders away from an unsolicited 107 billion takeover bid 
from paramount communications inc and win their support for times 
14 billion tender offer for warner communications inc 
basically times tack is to tell shareholders the instant 
gratification that paramounts 175ashare allcash bid offers is 
an illusion and that theyll profit more in the long run by holding 
on to their stock and allowing the timewarner merger to go through 
time took its campaign to the shareholders in a letter released 
to the press saturday the media giant spelled out the reasons why 
its board rejected the paramount bid and amended the terms of its 
earlier stockswap merger agreement with warner to include a 
70ashare offer for warner 
the letter which essentially reiterated points time officials 
made in statements and interviews friday told shareholders that 
paramounts offer was highly conditional and subject to many 
uncertainties including obtaining the necessary 14 billion of 
financing and all required regulatory approvals 
the company repeated its estimate that it would take as long as a 
year for paramount to win the approvals required from about 800 
cable television systems for which time now holds franchises that 
would delay the completion of paramounts bid and consequently 
payments to time shareholders for their stock 
time is making the franchises a key part of its strategy time 
president nicholas j nicholas jr led off an interview friday by 
zeroing in on the cable operations and warning further that 
paramount wont get financing if it doesnt win title to times 
assets including the cable operations 
times cable tv arm american television and communications corp 
of stamford conn said sunday that it had filed a lawsuit seeking 
to block paramounts tender offer unless paramount first gains 
approval for the transfer of all of atcs cable system franchises 
the connecticut superior court suit claims that paramounts bid 
to acquire time stock through a trust could violate the terms of a 
large majority of atcs 767 local cable tv franchises agreements 
thereby invalidating them 
the agreements would be invalidated because their terms state 
that ownership of the franchises cannot change hands without the 
approval of the municipalities or other agencies that granted them 
the suit says 
in a response sunday paramount said this is another 
diversionary suit without substance we are going to move promptly 
to dismiss it 
in its shareholder letter and an accompanying securities and 
exchange commission filing time charged that the terms of 
paramounts financing have not been determined or negotiated 
paramount said it remained confident the conditions will be 
satisfied with reasonable promptness and said it would continue to 
pursue time nicholas who under the timewarner proposal will 
eventually be chairman of the combined companies said time 
officials expected the unwanted suitor to raise its bid 
but even if paramount does put more money on the table time will 
keep reminding stockholders of the conditions that will still be 
attached to the bid and it will keep talking about the future of 
time and warner 
times letter said shareholders ultimately would benefit from the 
creation of timewarner inc because the price of their time stock 
would rise after the merger reflecting the assets and cash flow of 
both companies 
time stockholders would have an opportunity to share in the 
higher values expected from the pursuit of times longterm 
strategic objective to become a worldwide media and entertainment 
company the letter said 
shareholders of both time and warner had been scheduled to vote 
friday on the original merger proposal but time said the meeting 
would be adjourned until june 30 and that shareholders would vote 
only on the election of directors and other matters not related to 
the merger 
time said the early returns of proxies mailed in connection with 
the original agreement strongly supported the timewarner 
combination however many of these proxies likely were received 
before paramount announced its 175pershare cash bid on june 6 
time outlined on friday a twostage offer under which it would 
pay 70 a share in cash for 100 million warner shares in a tender 
offer and then exchange 70 a share in cash and securities for the 
remaining 100 million shares of warner stock 
a merger of time and warner would drive up the cost of acquiring 
the company the acquisition of warner also would increase times 
debt load and make it less attractive to wouldbe bidders 
under the agreement announced in march time stockholders would 
have received a share in the new company timewarner inc for each 
time share while warner shareholders would get 0465 of a share of 
the new company for each of their warner shares 
time conceded in its letter that the original timewarner merger 
plan had accounting and financial advantages because it involved an 
exchange of stock that would be lost under the new proposal 
but time officials said the company would issue fewer or no new 
shares after the merger giving each existing time share a greater 
proportion of timewarners assets and cash flow

a small wisconsin beermaker is 
brewing a new image with slick television ads that may be a bit hard 
to swallow for some longtime point beer drinkers 
the beer once touted on tshirts as not just for breakfast 
anymore is featured in 30second commercials with fastpaced 
music the glossy look of national ads and quick shots of 
longlegged women in short skirts 
one shows a couple falling on a bed each ends with an attractive 
blonde and the slogan score a few points tonight 
the commercials have aired frequently since memorial day weekend 
but only on the television stations in the wausaustevens point area 
in that small market point beer is going headtohead with 
national brands in its television campaign said kenneth shibilski 
stevens point brewery president 
today more sizzle is sold than steak shibilski said last 
week people are drinking more of the image than the product 
he said about 75 percent of the private brewerys sales are 
within a 50mile area of is home in stevens point a city of about 
23000 in northcentral wisconsin 
the brewery hopes the ads can change its image as the hometown 
beer that dad used to drink to a quality fun brew young adults will 
choose for a loyal brand said shibilski 
the brewery established in 1857 also hopes the commercials can 
stem a 15 percent drop in sales from three years ago he said 
point like a vanishing number of other small breweries has to 
do something to compete with bigger beer names that can price their 
products lower and are better known said shibilski president of 
the brewers association of america 
the hometown reaction to the commercials has been mostly positive 
but people are a bit stunned by them local bartenders said 
a lot of people dont feel that what they the ads are 
protraying is stevens point said tina kerske who has poured 
point from the tap for 2 years at the thirsty whale in stevens 
point 
women at her bar are more likely to wear jeans and tshirts 
rather than short skirts she said 
they keep saying they want to meet a woman who dresses like 
that and drinks point she said 
in wausau todd rasmussen 33 the manager of scott street steak 
amp pub said people like the idea of a nationallooking 
commercial the only thing negative i heard is that they the 
commercials are too liberal for this conservative of an area 
shibilski defended the ads as spicy but not sexist 
the couple shown falling onto a bed as a voiceover says 
remember when the partys over there are better things to do 
than drive drunk is fully clothed he noted 
the point commercials are aimed at 21 to 25yearold men because 
they are the heaviest beer drinkers said rick stone a partner at 
lindsay amp stone advertising inc in madision which created the 
campaign 
our overall strategy for point is to try to develop some fun 
around the product stone said 
shibilski said it is still too early to tell what effect the 
commercials will have on sales but that the brewery plans to run the 
ads all summer and looks for results farther in the future 
we want to be one of the breweries thats going to be around in 
the 21st century he said

when kraft realized its ready to roll contest 
was flawed and had produced more winners than losers the food 
company should have decided on a response more quickly public 
relations experts say 
the contest in which hundreds or possibly thousands of people 
won the same 17000 dodge minivan was a public relations 
disaster that left kraft officials scurrying for a response when the 
error was discovered june 11 
our advice to kraft immediately would have been to go public 
with this thing said walter mulhall codirector of 
mulhallkemplin communications the way to handle things is to 
offer a lot of explanation and candor and theyre certainly not 
being candid 
kraft based in the chicago suburb of glenview and known formally 
as the kraft general foods group of philip morris cos offered to 
make up for the mixup by quadrupling the number of prizes giving 
away cash and adding special drawings 
to win a customer had to match two halves of a picture of a van 
one from packages of cheese and the other printed in newspaper 
advertisements a printing error apparently gave nearly everybody 
matching pieces 
kraft announced thursday it would pay 250 to everybody who was 
holding a winning ticket for the van and other cash payouts to 
winners of other prizes bicycles skateboards and cheese winners 
will be eligible for a drawing for four vans 
the one thing that the public understands is that people screw 
up said pat jackson editor of pr reporter an industry magazine 
kraft should have gone public if they carried it off with 
humility they could have gotten the public on their side instead 
this kind of lastminute payoff doesnt take care of all the 
disgruntled people 
at least two lawsuits have been filed because of the botched 
contest 
jackson said the slow response led people to believe the company 
had something to hide 
when kraft ducks under the covers it immediately sends the 
message they are lying he said facts have nothing to do 
with getting people on your side its all a matter of perception 
the company also erred in not calling on top executives to 
address the mixup many in the public relations industry said 
a ceo himself has to have the guts to come out and exert some 
authority not hide behind the statements of his pr director 
added ted pincus chairman of the financial relations board 
kraft spokeswoman kathy knuth would not comment friday on the 
companys handling of the contest beyond saying this is my job 
it certainly has been difficult and it has been interesting

corn and soybean futures prices were sharply 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade buoyed 
by a mostly dry weekend in the corn belt and forecasts for at least 
a week of hot weather 
the change from cool rainy weather to warmer drier conditions 
is reigniting drought fears in the midwest which has not fully 
recovered from last years devastating drought 
people are hypersensitive after last year so thats whats got 
them going this morning said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
the corn market is getting additional support from the 
agriculture departments decision to extend the due date on loans 
covering 700 million bushels of corn keeping at least some of that 
grain off the market for another six months 
gains in the wheat market were limited by selling linked to the 
advancing winter wheat harvest

contract for delivery in july at 397 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 9 cents higher with july at 271 a bushel oats were 5 cents to

the economic story of the coming decade will be 
written in three words brains over brawn 
in the 1990s and beyond knowhow and inventiveness will emerge 
as the kn every field from selling hamburgers to 
fighting wars to forging steel 
the emergence of a knowledgebased world economy will create neweys 
to success i 
winners but it also will create new losers people companies and 
countries that cant find a place in a world moving beneath their 
feet 
associated press writers from around the country found that the 
dawning knowledge economy is remaking societies and shifting the 
balance of global power those who exploit the trend are riding it 
to success those who do not are getting run over 
what weve had is a change in rewards for different kinds of 
skills you could think of it as brain power vs muscle power or 
paperandpencil skills vs other skills says harvard economist 
richard b freeman 
knowledge is not only power it is money and the erosion of 
american living standards directly reflects how led democracy 
movement to the surge in lawsuits over copyrights to congressional 
opposition to the fsx fighter deal with japan 
all around the world the struggle for power is becoming a battle 
of wits in the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev is 
pressing for glasnost and perestroika out of an awareness that his 
economic push will fail unless he can unlock the imaginations of the 
russian people 
in armonk ny international business machines corp is 
spending 900 million a year slightly more than the annual budget 
of harvard university to educate and train employees in everything 
from robotics to public speaking 
in miamis troubled liberty city frederick morley is trying to 
prepare the predominantly black poor students of drew elementary 
school for a hightech world that threatens to trap them in poverty 
the way out is education literacy and skills i think theyre 
listening the principal says 
the quintessential product of the new era software is nothing 
but a language of encoded knowledge traveling freely between 
computers economic visionaries say the people who can parlay their 
thoughts into this language hold the key to the creativity that will 
shape our future 
the major capital of the next century is going to be minds 
that produce ideas alan greenspan chairman of the federal 
reserve said in a recent speech to american and japanese executives 
the brainsoverbrawn trend is hardly new of course francis 
bacon observed in 1597 that knowledge is power whats new is that 
technology has made knowledge more mobile and infinitely more potent 
in the past year fiberoptic cables that carry information at 
the speed of light have been laid across the atlantic and pacific 
oceans for the first time its now possible for soviet scientists 
to plug directly into us scientific data networks by computer 
literacy rates have leaped in many developing countries allowing 
them to absorb technology quickly from the big industrial economies 
knowledge has become the great equalizer making it possible for 
anyone anywhere to compete and succeed unlike oil timber or 
nuclear bombs knowledge can be created and spread on a blackboard 
with a stub of chalk in bangkok thailand as easily as in omaha 
neb 
in 1866 international communication was only for the elite it 
cost 100 to send a 20word cable from new york to london on the 
first undersea cable today it costs 1 to send about 4000 words 
over the same route using an ordinary personal computer and modem 
japans rise to power from a string of rocky islands is the best 
evidence that a nation does not need amber waves of grain to make it 
in the age of the knowledge economy 
conversely alaskans have discovered since the exxon valdez spill 
the frailty of an economy built on natural resources largely oil 
fish and wilderness beauty 
the knowledge economy poses challenges at all levels of society 
for governments businesses and individuals for the us 
government it is a question of focusing on the big picture 
longrange strategists say 
to some people that means industrial planning and initiatives 
such as sematech the governmentindustry program in austin texas 
to restore competitiveness in computer chip manufacturing 
people like kathryn harrigan a professor at columbia university 
say preserving american expertise should be a central objective of 
us trade policy 
let foreigners buy as many hightech us companies as they want 
so long as americans are guaranteed the intellectually demanding 
jobs she says in a war she says the us government always could 
nationalize the companies

for state and local governments education and aid to worker 
training are probably the biggest contributions they can make to 
their citizens ability to cope 
west germanys mederer corp for example makes trolli gummi 
candies in iowa under a state program that reimburses a company up 
to 50 percent of a new workers salary and benefits for onthejob 
training 
it was a major factor in locating the plant manager gary 
buck says 
in the private sector meanwhile a new kind of democracy is 
emerging a belief in lifelong selfimprovement and a commitment to 
the principle that anyone can have a good idea 
a potentially harmful countertrend also is bubbling up however 
in the name of efficiency and uniformity some companies are 
deskilling the jobs of fastfood laborers reservation clerks 
and even bankers and social workers removing their flexibility with 
rules concocted by centralized experts 
yankee ingenuity is still admired around the globe but the 
deskilling movement is expanding too fed by the management search 
to exert control and avoid the vulnerability of relying on 
illeducated workers 
extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to eliminate the 
need for human ingenuity author barbara garson writes in a 1988 
book the electronic sweatshop 
we call it cloning your best man says george keller 
executive vice president of afsm international an association of 
hightech field service workers 
keller says he likes the new systems which allow generalists to 
do specialized repairs by following rules stored in a laptop 
computer but he also worries people could become overly dependent 
on them 
people like to use crutches sometimes he said 
there is no reason the knowledge economy must lead to drudgery 
in fact the assemblyline mentality catching on in some offices is 
disappearing in the factories where it began 
respect for peoples ideas at ls electrogalvanizing co in 
cleveland for example has led to a dramatic surge in pride among 
the companys workers who make sheet steel for auto bodies 
wes humphrey vice president of united steelworkers local 9126 at 
the plant says the esprit de corps there is so strong that now we 
wrap coils like its christmastime 
many managers recognize this lesson if we dont work with our 
employees to make them happier and get more work out of them were 
all doomed says david hoag president of ltv steel co one of 
lss corporate parents which got religion during its chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings 
for companies that reject the deskilling approach to survival 
the alternative is shouldering more of the burden of education that 
will pinch smaller businesses that cant spare 18000 people at a 
time the number of ibmers who receive education or training on a 
typical day 
by the year 2000 65 percent of all jobs will require some 
training or education beyond high school compared with 54 percent 
now according to a study by the american society for training and 
development 
many companies complain that their training will go to waste 
because newly trained workers will jump to jobs elsewhere that is 
indeed a problem since good training is so spotty still training 
pays 
in a study for the national academy of engineering charles w 
hoover of new yorks polytechnic university concluded that education 
outlays for engineers are among the best investments even in the 
short term 
for workers or those hoping to find jobs the keys are lifelong 
education and flexibility 
increasingly were in a more complex economy and that is 
making for more complex and more demanding jobs says samuel 
ehrenhalt regional commissioner for the us bureau of labor 
statistics 
unfortunately for those who want to adapt its getting tougher 
american society is splintering into a small segment of overworked 
technology wizards a great mass of people who know just enough to 
get by and another small but growing segment mired in permanent 
poverty the underclass 
fourteen percent of american adults cannot locate the united 
states on a map about one in five believes the sun revolves around 
the earth most young adults cannot decipher a bus schedule a 
department of education survey found 
while american educators struggle to cultivate the seeds of 
modern knowledge in this country foreign literacy is flourishing 
japanese automakers that opened us plants found they had to 
hire college graduates to fill assembly jobs that would have been 
filled by high school graduates in japan 
americans still win a disproportionate share of nobel prizes in 
science but by most other measures the top of the knowledge pyramid 
is eroding as badly as the base 
last year eight of the top 10 winners of us patents were 
foreign companies half the assistant professors of engineering at 
us graduate schools are foreign 
as the us economy becomes more closely tied to the global one 
the winners will be those people whose services for whatever 
reason are in world demand that includes movie stars athletes 
lawyers and specialists like michael milken the junk bond king 
losers are those whose jobs can be done abroad dataentry jobs 
are moving to farflung locales from northern ireland to china some 
credit card and insurance companies have their billing statements 
done in the caribbean boeing co has had programming done in the 
philippines 
norman bodek executive director of the data entry management 
association of stamford conn was prophetic when he proclaimed 
three years ago that eventually an office in india will be no 
different than next door 
perhaps the biggest direct threat to ordinary americans is that 
the knowledge economy could permanently split the population and 
undermine any reason for the winners to help the losers the 
alienation and political consequences of that gulf are profound 
as our economic fates diverge harvard professor robert reich 
wrote recently the top fifth may be losing the sense of 
connectedness with the bottom fifth or even the bottom half that 
would elicit such generosity

crack addicts who used to spill their life 
stories to jesus frias in a basement office of a brooklyn hospital 
are now telling them to a computer instead 
the traditional intake interview through which the drug 
counselor gained insight into a new patient has been replaced by a 
multiplechoice questionnaire that the patient fills out alone 
a computer program converts the patients answers to the 132 
questions into a narrative a formulaic twopage biography 
frias 34 said he understands why computers have taken over the 
initial interviews for one thing they give counselors more time 
for other meetings with patients but he said something is lost 
without that first facetoface contact 
when you ask the question is your father or mother alive and 
they say yes even that yes tells you a lot you can say you dont 
sound too happy your fathers alive 
the automation of some phases of addiction counseling is part of 
a streamlining and simplification of jobs everywhere made possible 
by technology and sophisticated management techniques critics call 
it dumbing down 
wisecracking shortorder cooks are disappearing from the american 
scene replaced by drones who answer to french fry computers 
electronic monitoring is squeezing out the folksy airline 
reservation clerks who tell callers that vancouver is nice this time 
of year 
even stockbrokers those cowboys of finance are getting lassoed 
some big firms now decide centrally how and where clients should 
invest their money reducing brokers to happytalking functionaries 
office automation is rising almost floor by floor to engulf 
higher and higher strata of whitecollar workers barbara garson 
wrote in a 1988 book the electronic sweatshop 
turning human work over to computers is not an inescapable part 
of the emerging knowledge economy many companies are moving in the 
other direction trying to gain a competitive edge by encouraging 
employees to think independently 
but there are powerful social forces behind human automation 
including a shortage of skilled workers and managements innate 
desire for greater control 
counselors and administrators at the poly drug clinic of kings 
county addictive hospital say the computerization of intake 
interviews has brought greater efficiency and uniformity 
the questionnaire developed by auto assess inc asks for 
example how much patients spend daily for drugs and what they do in 
their spare time 
another companys psychological screening inventory requires 
patients to answer true or false to statements such as i enjoy 
classical music strange voices have spoken to me and 
shooting is a good sport 
computers translate the answers into neat statements containing 
sentences such as client feels she is a normal drinker 
counselors are supposed to plug holes with a personal interview 
when interviews were done in person the writeups tended to be 
messy and incomplete especially when done by the lesseducated 
counselors hired at a time when it was in vogue to use former 
addicts in rehabilitation they also took two hours or more to do 
right 
its a finite instrument like all but the purpose is to save 
us time for the counselor said the clinic director jerry 
halloran 
the downside of it would be a counselor getting this back and 
filing it away and never looking at it he said 
crack the highly addictive smokable form of cocaine is 
ravaging poor neighborhoods of brooklyn the success rate for 
treatment is low especially in an outpatient clinic like the poly 
drug clinic knowing a patient well can help a counselor head off 
predictable trouble frias said 
the computerized reports are sometimes adequate sometimes not 
frias said he fears they could be a temptation to laziness and by 
saving counselors time they give budgeters a rationale for not 
adding more counselors to cope with an increased load of crack 
addicts 
youre removing the need for skilled people now you just need 
people to file frias said 
overall frias concludes the computerization is probably good in 
any case he said once its introduced and people notice its 
convenient nobody wants to do more work youre not going to go 
back to the old way

a 19thcentury factory that once produced 
linseed oil is pumping out ideas today as the home of a new kind of 
company a product consulting firm 
style counts at companies such as innovation amp development inc 
which help other companies turn technology into dollars by making 
products easier to use and nicer to look at

the testing section is strewn with a bag of golf clubs a

the atmosphere of innovations amp development reflects the change 
in the balance of power from gritty industry to the knowledge

when baxter healthcare corp invented a better way to administer 
fluids to hospital patients it turned to innovations amp development 
to help make it a product 
the firms designers visited hospitals did market research

robert noyce watched the technology he 
helped create slip across the pacific and is fighting to rekindle 
americas brainpower in the war for economic survival 
noyce 61 has come to texas capital from silicon valley where 
he coinvented the integrated circuit and helped found intel corp 
a giant of the us chip industry 
last year noyce became the first chief executive of sematech a 
joint industrygovernment effort to reclaim us dominance in the 
45 billion semiconductor industry by 1993 
noyces rallying cry is national security both militarily and 
economically 
in the last 10 years japan has almost taken over the 
semiconductor business us market share fell from about 55 percent 
to 40 percent from 1984 to 1987 the commerce department estimates 
chips are the base of the food chain of electronics the core 
elements in everything from supercomputers to coffee makers 
the idea behind sematech is to bring together the best brains in 
the united states whether they work for national semiconductor 
corp or intel for international business machines corp or 
american telephone amp telegraph co to figure out the best 
fastest cheapest way to make computer chips 
i fundamentally believe that even if sematech is a failure it 
will still be a success if we continue to push that sort of 
program says g dan hutcheson president of vlsi research inc a 
market research company in san jose calif 
already you see signs in terms of some of the product 
development hutcheson said problems are being solved theres 
enormous improvement in yields 
since sematech was started engineers have started calling each 
other and talking he said 
it is this freeflowing exchange of information so crucial to 
learning and science that sematech and other consortia are trying 
to encourage 
the obstacle however is historical american reluctance to share 
knowledge with a competitor for fear that hell beat you at your own 
game 
there are detractors xerox corp chairman david kearns said his 
company had declined to participate because it did not believe the 
level of investment justified the possible return 
i applaud the idea of getting together kearns said but he 
suggested that smaller twocompany combinations would be more 
useful because the results could be more easily tailored to the 
participants needs 
in addition a commerce department study said the us computer 
chip industry will remain faced with trade tax and antitrust issues 
regardless of sematechs performance 
although the report recommends congress spend 100 million on 
sematech next year it cautions that such cooperative efforts should 
be treated with care 
electronics is the nations largest manufacturing employer with 
more than 25 million people largely in california massachusetts 
minnesota new york and texas the american electronics association 
says 
although companies in europe have teamed up to form consortiums 
like sematech it is japan that has taken the lead and where experts 
look for guidance 
japan is a beautiful example of a knowledgebased economy 
says noyce 
sematech an acronym for semiconductor manufacturing technology 
is a consortium of 14 semiconductor makers and users and the us 
government that was created in 1987 to find ways to make 
semiconductors faster and better than anyone else 
already sematech has built a wafer fabrication unit and 
manufactured its first silicon wafer the wafer fab built in 32 
weeks and producing three days ahead of schedule is itself a major 
accomplishment noyce said 
us companies produced about 85 percent of all silicon wafers in 
1984 but just over 20 percent in 1987 commerce department figures 
show sematechs aim is to reverse that trend 
across town from sematech is another consortium microelectronics 
and computer corp where similar work is done on a broader range of 
computer research eight companies including motorola inc digital 
equipment corp ncr corp hewlettpackard co and national 
semiconductor are members of both consortia 
experts claim the united states has lost its edge because of too 
much attention to immediate profits at the expense of research and 
investment 
up until the last 15 years america was riding high clearly 
the highest standard of living in the world noyce said 
noyce notes that the japanese success was based on cooperation 
among competitors an anathema in american business that sematech 
hopes to change 
we have to overcome our own idea that were the superior 
race said hutcheson there are other people out there that are 
working harder than we are theyre intelligent theyre innovative 
theyre doing everything that we did but somehow forgot

by midmorning it was business as usual in miamis 
liberty city district 
a kid on a fancy bicycle ferried crack cocaine past a housing 
project where the bulletriddled body of a 34yearold mother was 
discovered before dawn a squad car screamed by blue lights 
pulsing the owner of a furniture store looted in last januarys 
riots waited at the door for customers he was armed 
inside a small cementblock building set apart from the drew 
elementary school students in blue and white uniforms were told 
their future is not necessarily foreshadowed by events on the other 
side of the chainlink fence 
we let them know there are alternatives to drugs to poverty 
to crime said drew principal frederick morley the way out is 
education literacy and skills i think theyre listening 
the success of educators like morley is vital not only to the 
people of liberty city but to the nation as a whole 
as labor shortages arise companies are hiring people from 
disadvantaged backgrounds out of necessity not philanthropy at the 
same time the knowledgebased economy demands more sophisticated 
skills than ever 
morley and others concede programs such as drews careertraining 
laboratory are pitted against a goliath years of disillusionment 
and frustration rule the citys predominantly black innercity 
neighborhoods 
nearly 300000 latin american refugees have entered miami this 
decade and americanborn blacks complain that the immigrants are 
receiving preferential treatment the resentment was a catalyst in a 
threeday riot earlier this year in liberty city the third major 
urban upheaval in miami this decade 
we feel like the indians out west we were here first and the 
newcomers are squeezing us out said tyrone greene 31 
morley is focusing on the positive in his school ideals of 
success and perseverance are drilled into the 600 first to 
sixthgrade students about a third of whom attend voluntary 
saturday classes begun this year 
an 18yearold careerplanning lab at the school is a model for 
similar programs nationwide 
each day participating students punch simulated time cards and 
head to an appointed task at one end of the room children tap out 
letters on electric typewriters while others as young as 7 work on 
personal computers on the other side boys and girls learn to set 
hair and apply cosmetics 
a real estate agent instructs children on property marketing as 
others nearby study the rudiments of electronics or repairing an 
airplane wing 
they call each other mr and mrs 
we get them young enough so they arent already locked into a 
selfdefeating life of drugs or crime said morley whose school 
has received national awards and hosted vice president dan quayle in 
february 
when they leave this school they are surrounded by all sorts 
of negative influences we dont want their role models to be pimps 
and dealers 
while morley shepherds children miamis black adults are 
learning business skills from philip mann whose round white face 
and shaggy mustache seems more suited to an irish pub than a ghetto 
streetcorner 
im just trying to provide the tools the education to move 
in the right direction said mann a university of miami professor 
who founded the entrepreneurial institute in response to liberty 
city riots in 1982 
the 15 fiveweek courses include accounting international 
business and business computer software about twothirds of the 
2500 students who have taken them since 1983 are black 
theres an amazing resilience in the human species the body 
and mind only lets you go so far into destitution then the sense of 
survival takes over mann said thats what were hoping to tap 
into that sense that the black community will claw back against 
the odds 
education alone will not get blacks into the economic mainstream 
in miami among other things they face discrimination from white 
and hispanic businesses and a deterioration of the social fabric in 
black communities 
listen ill hire any one but it seems the ones who can and 
want to work are the haitians and the latins said charles 
genthner president of fire hose corp which makes fire hoses in a 
1yearold liberty city plant 
there has to be the idea that getting into the work force is 
the best option said john cordrey an economist at the beacon 
council a taxsupported miami area business group 
in my opinion the blacks have made the hispanics a scapegoat 
they see them working hard and they say they are taking our jobs 
said thomas boswell a university of miami professor studying local 
immigration what is really plaguing the black community here is a 
breakdown in the family 
identifying the problem is easy turning it around is 
difficult

a computer chip factory soon will rise 
from a corn field in this community of covered bridges the 
birthplace of john wayne 
for winterset 45 minutes southwest of des moines its a chance 
to exploit iowas reputation for a high literacy rate and a 
dedicated dependable work force 
for areas of iowa farther from des moines and its amenities a 
hightech solution to rural poverty and depopulation is more 
elusive the corn belt is not making a smooth transition to the 
knowledge economy 
small towns in iowa and across the midwest have found that good 
schools and a literate work force often touted as keys to success 
are not enough 
wouldbe employers demand access to good transportation modern 
hospitals sophisticated cultural and recreation attractions 
shopping malls and ample outside professional help from lawyers to 
cpas 
even when small towns succeed in industrial recruitment they 
dont get all the expected economic benefits 
new professionals who move in often opt to do their major 
shopping during weekend excursions to the big city says david 
forkenbrock director of the university of iowa public policy center 
the best way to strengthen the rural economy may be to put a 
barrier in the road to prevent people from going to the big city for 
cheaper goods forkenbrock is fond of saying 
even if iowa does everything right it should anticipate just 
modest growth in its personal income employment and population over 
the next 25 years research consultants say 
iowas agricultural history and its existing industry mix make 
it unlikely that the state will become known as a hightech state 
says a draft report prepared by the sri international center for 
economic competitiveness at menlo park calif 
still the report says a tradition of quality can be the basis 
for iowas more competitive more diverse and balanced economy 
in winterset a community of 4000 which stands to gain up to 600 
jobs the courtship of eac technologies inc a maker of control 
panels for appliances was a community affair 
as the high school band played happy days are here again a 
crowd representing everyone from the farmer in his bib overalls to 
the banker in his business suit celebrated the groundbreaking 
eac bought the business from motorola inc it is closing plants 
in taiwan and texas to build in iowa where it also will locate its 
headquarters and research and development center 
iowas reputation for good schools and an educated work force 
that can cope with technological change were strong selling points 
iowa has the highest college entrance exam scores among the 28 
states where the american college testing program is dominant it 
ranks fifth in the nation in high school graduation rates 
we need quality out of a dedicated work force that stays with 
us said tom phillips the president of eac 
small town schools produce such students because they are forced 
by economics to concentrate on the basics while students often 
suffer in the smorgasbord programs of bigger school systems 
said dick manatt director of the school improvement model projects 
at iowa state 
in small towns where everyone knows everyone else there is 
strong peer pressure to succed 
but a trainable reliable work force would not have been enough 
if winterset werent close to des moines and its shopping centers 
theaters museums and airport phillips said 
promises of cooperation from the microprocessor research center 
at iowa state university and of tailormade employee training from 
the des moines area community college also were selling points 
because of such attractions the area around des moines has been 
promoting itself as the golden circle its one of the few 
sectors of the state that grew in population from 1980 to 1987 when 
a sour farm economy caused a flight from rural america 
its pretty tough for a town thats not on the beaten path at 
all to make progress says thomas pogue an economist at the 
university of iowa 
shenandoah in southwest iowa points out that residents can get on 
the golf course in five minutes or to the doctors office in three 
but that approach often is not enough admitted day hacke the 
executive vice president of the shenandoah development corp 
if they want something beyond that they go somewhere else 
from a competitive standpoint youre going to come up short hacke 
said 
eacs phillips says he had to overcome some reservations before 
taking iowa seriously he was looking forward to building in the 
gentler climate of the south and had visions of north carolina golf 
courses when the search began he said he thought of iowa as 
farming flat and not hightech 
the key was that eac needed a work force that could be relied on 
to grasp new techniques and to show up each day and get the job done 
iowa fit that bill

katsura hattori pushed a button and the 
front page of his newspaper asahi shimbun appeared on a 40000 
prototype television 
even the tiny japanese script was clearly legible on the 
finegrained screen 10 times more detailed than a normal tv 
someday hattori said this may be how a lot of people read 
their newspaper in the morning 
if so most of the groundwork will have been done at the 
massachusetts institute of technology but the first commercial 
users probably will be japanese companies over the past four years 
they have handed mit millions of dollars and sent top employees like 
hattori to help with the research 
mit harvard texas aampm and a handful of other top us schools 
are getting enriched by foreign grants and bolstered by foreign 
researchers but critics say the help carries a high price donors 
are taking ideas and knowhow home draining a national resource 
i dont know why we permit it said irwin freest an engineer 
in massapequa park ny who has been campaigning for congress to 
send foreign engineering students packing 
it hurts us because what they do with their grants they take 
the knowledge back and sell us goods which increases our balance of 
trade deficit he said 
foreign companies and governments sponsor about 5 million of 
research a year at mit which has the highest percentage of foreign 
students of any us university onefifth of its total student body 
and onethird of its graduate students are nonus citizens 
two miles up the charles river at harvard foreign sources 
provide about 11 million a year for research in economics 
agriculture medicine and other fields about 6 percent of harvards 
undergraduates and 17 percent of its graduate students are 
foreigners 
alarmed by such statistics freest and others are calling for a 
kind of academic protectionism the erection of barriers to the 
free flow of students and knowledge across borders 
they are not alone similar pressures are building in other 
countries says dorothy zinberg a faculty member at harvards 
kennedy school of government who is preparing a report on the 
subject for the national science foundation 
japan and the netherlands are today the only two countries that 
are actively seeking to increase their numbers of foreign 
students she said in the us in france a bit less so in 
west germany people are very concerned about losing ideas 
zinberg said some us companies are now attaching strings to 
their university grants insisting that no foreigners be allowed to 
work on the research they support in france she said educators 
are subtly excluding foreigners from certain schools 
the university of rochesters graduate business school rescinded 
acceptance of an employee of fuji photo film co ltd after concerns 
were raised by hometown eastman kodak co it later reoffered 
admission but too late 
defenders of the open university see a dire threat in this they 
note that most leading universities in the united states have 
policies requiring all campus research to be freely publishable and 
therefore of at least as much benefit to american companies as to 
foreign ones 
they also say many foreign researchers and graduate students stay 
in the united states strengthening the nations brainpower 
most of all defenders argue that keeping universities open to 
all based only on academic qualifications is part of the universal 
ethic of science insulating ourselves they say will make us less 
competitive not more 
its generally seen today that american universities are among 
the best in the world said john shattuck harvards vice 
president for public affairs our whole higher education system is 
very attractive and its availability to foreign students is an 
asset to american society because they learn american values and 
become familiar with americans and americans are enriched by being 
exposed to them 
nationally less than 1 percent of all university research is 
paid for by foreign money but five big research institutions 
harvard mit texas aampm oregon state university and the university 
of wisconsin together receive more than half of all that money a 
kitty estimated at about 75 million a year 
experts say there are about 1 million students circulating from 
country to country worldwide and the largest number about 350000 
are in the united states more than half are in science and 
technology creating extraordinary imbalances such as the fact that 
foreigners now earn about 60 percent of the doctoral degrees granted 
in engineering by american universities 
like any protectionist move however attempts to restrict 
foreign students or research projects could be met in kind 
if were not careful zinberg said we may one day find our 
students shut out of foreign universities because we have shut them 
out of ours 
the research that foreigners are supporting on american campuses 
runs the gamut from studying aircraft turbines at mit to ocean 
drilling at texas aampm and weather monitoring at the university of 
wisconsin 
but much of the pressure to cut back the foreign presence comes 
from people in a few highly competitive industries such as 
electronics and biotechnology 
of course wed like people to take back skills and knowledge 
and apply them in their own countries especially the third world 
and countries that arent as fortunate as we are said frank lord 
an engineer with gte in san carlos calif and chairman of a 
manpower committee for the institute of electrical and electronic 
engineers 
but taking valuable technology is another matter and its a 
hard line to draw

now that rjr nabisco inc has to pay 3 billion a 
year in interest on takeover debt skeptics are wondering whether 
the research cookies will crumble at the company that makes oreos 
people are scrutinizing the record 25 billion leveraged buyout 
of rjr nabisco to see whether the heavy debts involved in this 
trendy form of takeover will hurt companies spending on new 
technology 
oreos look simple enough but getting them to screw apart the 
same way every time takes advanced engineering and ovens in the 
knowledge economy technology is built invisibly into the most 
unlikely products from ritz bits to salem slims lights which come 
in an eyecatching beveled box 
shortly before the rjr nabisco battle the company told 
stockholders it had upped research and development spending by 19 
percent it called technology the cornerstone of future growth 
since the buyout led by the new york investment firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co rjrs new management says it remains committed 
to research and development but wont say what changes if any will 
be made 
rampd is less important in rjr nabiscos businesses than in say 
computers or pharmaceuticals food and tobacco are two of the 
lowestranking industries in terms of rampd as a percentage of sales 
according to business weeks rampd scoreboard last year 
still analysts say a stunted rampd program could stop the company 
from creating a successful smokeless cigarette a fatfree frozen 
dinner or crumbleproof packaging for cookies 
so far theres little hard evidence to document the effect of 
big buyouts on research contributing to the dearth of information 
is that companies involved in large lbos tend to go private and 
financial figures become scarce 
but there is a growing perception that companies cut back on 
research immediately after a leveraged buyout if thats so 
debtfinanced megadeals could have a big impact on the knowledge 
economy 
whats happening in lbos is that they take on pretty extensive 
debt in the short term they have to make cuts said fred allvine 
a professor in the college of management at georgia institute of 
technology 
very often they try to cut the fat out of personnel then they 
look at research and development the benefits are hard to measure 
its one of the intangibles they cut back because lbos have to be 
concerned with payback in the short run 
rjr nabisco spokeswoman polly howes said research is continuing 
to function there are new products to develop and improvements to 
make but to speculate on what will happen is premature 
the company has major research centers at its nabisco brands 
inc del monte corp and rj reynolds tobacco co divisions 
in its 1987 annual report to shareholders rjr nabisco called 
research and development essential to the future of the company and 
said it had spent 204 million on it in 1987 no figures are 
available for 1988 
much of rjr nabiscos recent research and development has been in 
plant modernization it also sank about 200 million into the 
development of premier the socalled smokeless cigarette that 
bombed in test marketing last year the company has said it will 
keep working on a smokeless cigarette 
the brookings institution the national science foundation the 
university of california at berkeley and the university of chicago 
are among the institutions that have conducted studies looking at 
leveraged buyouts 
legitimate economists are all over the map on this said 
margaret blair senior research analyst at brookings in washington 
a nsf study said growth in corporate research and development 
spending has all but disappeared in the last five years the 
increase in leveraged buyouts has been a major reason the study 
said 
it found a 128 percent decline in research and development 
spending in companies involved in leveraged buyouts but melissa 
pollock of the nsf cautioned against sweeping assumptions based on 
the study noting it looked only at eight small deals for one year 
not enough for definitive conclusions 
a study of leveraged buyouts released earlier this year by 
kohlberg kravis disputed the notion that research suffers but the 
study also said buyouts should not involve companies that require a 
heavy research investment

gideon gartner was one of the first to 
realize that decisionmakers in business wanted more than reams of 
undigested facts and figures they wanted advice from professional 
thinkers 
gartner quit his stock pickers job at oppenheimer amp co a decade 
ago and began offering wall streetstyle insights and 
recommendations to buyers and sellers of computer equipment 
today gartner group is on the leading edge of the knowledge 
economy its considered one of the top computerindustry think 
tanks in the country with a list of 900 clients that includes 49 of 
the top 50 in the fortune 500 
annual revenue has been increasing 50 percent a year and is 
expected to reach 62 million this year 
were in the wisdom business says gartner an alumnus of 
massachusetts institute of technology and international business 
machines corp 
gartner 54 and silverhaired is a native israeli who combines 
courtly european manners with a preference for casual clothes 
he spurns suits and pads around his modern headquarters 
overlooking long island sound in shirt sleeves stylish slacks and 
walking shoes which he is constantly pitching to colleagues as more 
comfortable than their stiffleather dress shoes 
computer companies such as ibm turn to the gartner groups stable 
of 80 wellpaid analysts for insight on what their competitors are 
doing 
major computer users like american express co and pepsico inc 
rely on the gartner group for advice on which computers or software 
to choose whether to lease or buy and whether they are about to pay 
too much for systems that will soon be obsolete or are about to fall 
in price 
we havent bought any turkeys that i am aware of since we 
started using their services said william p dean director of 
technological management services at pepsico 
before gartner came along computerindustry watchers like 
international data corp pretty much restricted themselves to 
publishing encyclopedic reports that didnt provide the distilled 
bottomline advice that top executives needed to make decisions 
said portia isaacson wright of coloradobased future think inc who 
follows the business information publishing industry 
the gartner group now controls an estimated 60 percent of that 
highpriced market gideon gartner says 
gartner had the perfect background to turn the 500 
millionayear business of information publishing upside down 
wright said 
he spent seven years at ibm where he designed systems to measure 
how big blue was faring against competitors before landing on wall 
street where institutional investor magazine rated him the top 
individual securities analyst in the technology field between 1972 
and 1978 
an opera buff gartner abandoned a career as a french horn player 
because it was too much of what he called a lostsoul career to 
suit his engineerfather 
gartner discovered at mit that he didnt really want to be an 
engineer so he stayed on to get his masters degree in business 
from mits sloan school of management 
he really is an extraordinary analyst in just about every 
sense wright said hes highly intuitive in addition to being 
real numbersoriented 
one former colleague tells of the time he and three other gartner 
analysts using company data bases spent most of the night 
calculating the full impact of a recent ibm price cut they 
discovered the next day that gartner had arrived at nearly the same 
figures by himself doodling on a yellow legal pad on a flight back 
from europe 
gideon has more good ideas in 15 minutes than most people have 
in 15 years said thomas j crotty gartners first employee now 
retired hes always got a new ingenious thought gideons 
biggest problem is that he is not an implementer 
clients pay up to several hundred thousand dollars a year for the 
right to attend the gartner groups annual conferences pick its 
analysts brains and peruse any of the 13 analytical bulletins the 
company puts out 
the analysts most of them industry veterans cull information 
from computer users and sellers and boil it into incisive 
assessments during the freewheeling sometimes heated weekly 
meetings 
gartner group was acquired by saatchi amp saatchi of great britain 
the worlds largest advertising agency for 90 million last year 
gartner agreed to stay on as chairman through 1991 and as a 
parttime consultant another four years beyond that his plans are 
uncertain 
i could become an analyst again i do that pretty well he 
said

muscular workers welding the hulls of 
mammoth ships used to symbolize american business might no more 
only a handful of us shipbuilders are left and they are kept 
afloat by navy contracts the rest have fallen victim to lowwage 
competitors in south korea taiwan and brazil and hightech 
subsidized shipyards in japan and west germany 
in a knowledgebased economy the united states may get a second 
chance to compete for commercial shipbuilding contracts at least at 
the hightech end of the industry where american companies can tap 
experience gained from building stateoftheart warships 
its pretty difficult to compete with taiwan if all youre 
doing is welding steel said tom balfour marketing vice president 
for newport news shipbuilding and dry dock co the united states 
largest shipyard wed be strongest on those ships that require a 
greater degree of engineering 
there is little unskilled work left in building ships for the 
navy and shipyard workers are constantly retrained to keep up with 
changing techniques and new equipment 
the us is building the most sophisticated warships in the 
world says mitch steller a maritime consultant in san diego 
that fact he said could be an advantage for sophisticated 
commercial ships as well 
there are limits to the power of knowledge though shipbuilders 
say they also need dollars in the form of government subsidies to 
match those received by shipbuilders in japan and west germany 
the japanese and west germans supply their shipbuilders with 
millions of dollars in lowcost loans research and development 
funding and tax benefits says the shipbuilders council of america 
in washington 
ten years ago the us shipbuilding industry was the fifth 
largest with about 10 percent of the international market but when 
the reagan administration cut subsidies in 1981 shipbuilding 
declined rapidly 
today no commercial ships are built in the united states in the 
years since 1981 41 shipyards have closed and others are foundering 
survivors are the brawn of the business large navy contractors 
able to afford major investments in equipment and technology but 
even those companies are concerned about the impact of expected cuts 
in navy contracts 
a recent study by the commission on merchant marine and defense 
in washington concluded there is clear and growing danger to the 
national security in the deterioration of americas maritime 
industries 
theres not a maritime country in the world that doesnt 
subsidize its shipbuilding balfour said in a world with no 
subsidies we could compete 
the commission calls for government to jumpstart the 
shipbuilding industry by financing the design and construction of 
commercial ships that are also militarily useful and providing 
matching funds for capital improvements of shipyards 
the plan would cost about 13 billion in the next 11 years but 
would add 244 merchant ships to the nations fleets create nearly 
100000 jobs contribute more than 43 billion to the gross national 
product and raise 6 billion in federal taxes the commission 
contends 
the net cost would be less than 6 billion the commission said 
in a report to president bush adding that the possible costs of 
failing to provide adequate sealift would be much greater 
proponents say that without a commercial shipbuilding industry 
the united states does not have enough ships to carry supplies and 
troops in wartime 
they say if the number of shipyards continues to decline there 
will not be a large enough base of facilities suppliers and trained 
workers to meet the countrys military shipbuilding needs 
edward hudgins director of the conservative heritage 
foundations center for international growth in washington disputes 
the need to support a domestic shipbuilding industry 
i just dont see why we would need it if we can buy it 
somewhere else more cheaply hudgins said what were going to 
do is destroy our economy and make ourselves less capable of 
defending ourselves 
this whole idea that defense means being selfsufficient in 
everything is an absolutely ruinous policy he said these 
companies are not looking out for our security theyre looking out 
for themselves

when bill daugherty worked as a motor inspector 
for republic steel corp he didnt go out of his way to stay near 
the bosses 
you really tried to avoid them he said somebody told you 
to do this you did it in five minutes then you went and sat down 
until somebody told you to do something else 
even though he worked on equipment daugherty was forbidden to 
install electrical tubing that was reserved for another craft 
what was standard operating procedure for a united steelworkers 
member in the early 1980s is now history for those like daugherty 
out on the cutting edge of labormanagement relations 
in the emerging knowledge economy people like daugherty are 
valued as much for their grasp of the big picture as for their grip 
on a phillips screwdriver 
the 37yearold ls electrogalvanizing co employee roams the 
plant now repairing anything electrical he is encouraged to learn 
other crafts the company pays his tuition for technical courses 
and as his skills improve so does his pay 
daugherty can make a dollar per hour above the average industry 
wage to around 13 per hour or around 27000 per year production 
bonuses and overtime can push the annual figure to around 40000 
nobody hides from the bosses anymore workers step forward with 
ideas to improve operations at the sheet steel coating plant a 
6040 joint venture of ltv corp and sumitomo metal industries of 
japan in fact employees are paid to meet regularly with their 
managers 
if we dont work with our employees to make them happier and 
get more work out of them were all doomed said ltv steel co 
president david hoag how can you talk about international 
competitiveness when people hate their jobs 
companies such as ls electrogalvanizing are actually ahead of 
the vaunted japanese in labor relations hoag argues 
japanese steel companies havent advanced beyond the quality 
circle an early form of participative management that employees 
here dismiss as a glorified suggestion box 
sumitomo officials had to be coaxed to accept the partnership 
program hoag said 
the japanese are more autocratic than the americans ever were 
they have a lot of ways of eliciting suggestions but in the end 
the talk doesnt mean a thing he said 
the 65 employees of ls electrogalvanizing who produce topgrade 
galvanized sheet for auto body panels are pioneers in a 4yearold 
venture in industrial democracy dawn is breaking on a realm long 
shaded by arrogance mistrust and retribution 
everybody knows whats going on everybody pulls together 
said john gresh 30 who joined the company two years ago 
where the united states once monopolized the worlds steelmaking 
knowhow just about anybody can make steel these days and just 
about everybody is 
whats harder to come by is smart steel the kind ls 
electrogalvanizing produces its made on computercontrolled mills 
in less time by fewer people its freer of defects more precise in 
composition and monotonously true in its dimensions 
smart steel is shaping up as the american steel industrys ticket 
into the 21st century us producers are getting smart with better 
technology new furnaces continuous casters and rolling mills that 
represent the best thinking in metallurgy 
with innovations as simple as changing the way workers and bosses 
talk to one another companies are tapping a longsealed repository 
of profitable information the rankandfile employee 
at ls electrogalvanizing a lone process coordinator is often 
the only manager on hand and that person helps the 12 others on 
duty to operate the highly automated line 
parking spaces are firstcome firstserved locker rooms are 
segregated only by sex there is one dining room no time clock and 
everyone has a key to the tool room 
its like being among your friends at school not one of us 
minds doing cleanup because we pride ourselves on our mill gresh 
said 
management handed the workers a study estimating the price of a 
chemical engineering project at 90000 and the workers did it for 
5000 said operations manager mike mueller our people just 
recognize a problem and take it on 
joint unionmanagement committees can change anything except the 
financial terms of the ontract including training requirements for 
new workers and production goals which bear on bonuses 
although decisions are made by consensus there has never been an 
impasse 
work rules are few and simple be there be there on time and 
do what you have to do to complete your assignment said mueller 
now we wrap coils like its christmastime said wes humphrey 
the vice president of steelworkers local 9126 
overall the workers so respect management that union officials 
proposed that the unions superior production bonus plan be extended 
to cover process coordinators the equivalent of frontline foremen 
they work just like us they eat dirt with us they should get 
the gravy with us humphrey said 
participative management emerged in the 1980 contract talks and 
its popularity grew as the industry lost 12 billion from 1982 to 
1986 amid plant closings and the elimintion of more than 100000 
jobs 
ltv corp remains under court protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
ive seen so much heartache and suffering it was too 
disheartening to just look at and not try to do something about

the two biggest steelmakers in bankruptcy court 
are the two that have done the most to involve employees in managing 
plants says a united steelworkers official overseeing programs to 
improve life in the mills 
usw international secretary edgar ball gives the top marks to ltv 
steel co and wheelingpittsburgh steel corp both reorganizing 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws 
he recognized ltv for supporting labor management participation 
teams which give employees new authority to solve production and 
personnel problems 
ltv just worked all out to make that system work and expand 
it ball said in an interview 
ltvs joint venture in cleveland with sumitomo of japan ls 
electrogalvanizing co has an even more progressive arrangement in 
which workers are largely unsupervised 
their freedom responsibility and authority is unmatched among 
major steelmakers and is among the most progressive anywhere ball 
said 
he praised wheelingpittsburgh for its modified system of 
labormanagement teams 
a miniboard of directors staffed equally from management and 
the union oversees operations at the plant and department levels 
on the shop floor task forces do anything from correct malfunctions 
to reorganize production 
other steel companies have not come as far ball said 
armco incs program was rejected by plant and division managers 
he said 
national steel corp has a partnership program on paper but it 
encountered resistance at the plant level he said 
bethlehem steel corp and usx corp have plantlevel programs 
some highly successful but none at the corporate level and the two 
linger near the back of the pack he said 
ussposco industries inc the usx joint venture with pohang of 
south korea has labormanagement participation teams at its 
pittsburg calif plant but nothing approaching the ltvsumitomo 
joint venture said robert guadiana a usw district director for 
california 
inland and nippon of japan are duplicating the ltvsumitomo 
partnership at a joint venture under construction at new carlisle 
ind 50 miles east of gary 
jampl specialty products corp a stainless and alloy steelmaker 
spun off from ltv is out front in the specialty steel industry 
ball said 
a usw local at the companys detroit plant despite internal 
union criticism for cooperating with management has boosted 
productivity through ad hoc teams the company is rewarding workers 
with profitsharing payments that boost annual pay to around 
50000 ball said 
outside steel rockwell international corp began a cooperative 
program with the usw at its new castle pa axle plant after 
announcing plans to close the facility in 1982 and moving one of its 
departments to south carolina 
it worked so well they not only did not shut the plant but 
brought back the department from south carolina ball said 
aluminum co of america negotiated a participative management 
program for a texas plant in 1977 the first such arrangement 
involving the usw ball said 
other programs have been started by xerox corp and the 
amalgamated clothing and textile workers at a rochester ny 
plant and by goodyear tire co at a nonunion plant in lawton okla 
wheelingpitt is enjoying harmony in place of bitter relations 
under its traditional system 
theres been a vast improvement said john kohelis who left 
the companys steubenville ohio rail car repair shop to become a 
fulltime facilitator helping teams carry out projects 
theres greater cooperation better understanding he said 
were doing so well weve broken every major production record in 
wheelingpittsburghs history 
at its best participative management can make diehard union men 
gush with enthusiasm 
i dont care what anybody says if you give the american worker 
the education the equipment and the opportunity well blow anyone 
apart weve got the greatest work ethic of any country in the 
world said tom zidec the 35yearold president of steelworkers 
local 9126 at the ltvsumitomo joint venture ls electrogalvanizing 
do i sound optimistic he said people tell me im too 
happy i dont love this place but its a good job better than

patents the guard dogs of innovation are 
gaining strength and attention as americas first line of defense 
against purloined corporate ingenuity 
an unprecedented number of applications are flooding the us 
patent and trademark office which expects more than 156000 this 
year up 5 percent from last year 
courts are siding more often with holders of patents trademarks 
and copyrights and the phrase intellectual property has entered 
the lexicon of the emerging knowledgebased economy 
why all the interest because american industry from steel to 
clothing to microwave ovens is running scared 
if youre the undisputed leader in some technology patents are 
not that important because you pretty much call the shots thats 
what it was like 30 years ago said michael blommer executive 
director of the american intellectual property law association 
but today the united states has lost its lead in almost every 
technology and patents are becoming much more important thats 
really all you have to protect yourself 
some critics say the pendulum has swung too far toward protecting 
patent and copyright holders stifling progress by preventing 
inventors from building on what has come before 
others say tough patent protection isnt helping the united 
states against technology leaders such as japan and west germany 
eight of the top 10 winners of us patents last year were foreign 
companies 
isnt strengthening the patent system also strengthening the 
nonresidents asked ogden webster director of eastman kodak 
cos patent law department 
one winner in the patent battlefield is corning inc formerly 
known as corning glass works where engineers revolutionized 
communications in 1970 with their invention of optical fibers 
these are hairthin glass fibers that transport voices pictures 
and data on pulses of laser light opticalfiber cables crisscross 
the country and the atlantic and pacific oceans 
corning anticipated billions of dollars in revenue from its 
invention however other companies were eyeing the potential 
market too 
six years after the invention even before much of the world was 
convinced of the usefulness of cornings creation the company found 
itself trying to enforce its patents 
corning sued american dutch and japanese competitors it even 
sued the us government for buying fiber from a competitor from 
july 1976 until earlier this year the company was immersed in 
patent enforcement lawsuits 
the company won numerous settlements but sumitomo electric 
industries ltd of japan remained a holdout the japanese company 
even built a factory in research triangle park nc to make fibers 
corning won a court order in october 1987 forcing sumitomo to 
stop making optical fiber at its north carolina plant sumitomo was 
allowed to make cable but had to get the fiber for it from a 
competitor 
the damage portion of the patent infringement trial is pending 
today corning is the dominant producer 
corning is a believer in the patent system its very much a 
part of its research activity to see it working is good said al 
michaelsen cornings chief patent lawyer 
the corning experience is one that politicians and government 
officials like to hear 
as we look to the future our ability to compete successfully 
is going to depend on our brainpower not our brawn said michael 
kirk assistant commissioner for external affairs at the us patent 
and trademark office 
a report by the us international trade commission last year 
estimated us companies lose between 43 billion and 61 billion a 
year because of inadequate foreign protection of intellectual 
property 
singapore taiwan and thailand reportedly have begun to cleanse 
their reputations as piracy havens but south korea is still a major 
offender the commission says 
companies must apply for patents in each country where they want 
protection rules differ for instance italy refuses to grant 
patents to new drugs 
japans patent office takes five years on average to issue a 
patent vs about 1 years in the united states says donald j 
quigg us commissioner of patents and trademarks 
an american inventor awaiting a patent in japan has little legal 
protection and therefore is almost forced to share the technology 
with competitors through crosslicensing agreements quigg complains 
it is much easier for japanese companies to get patents in the 
united states for example hitachi ltd won more us patents last 
year than any american company 
kirk is helping negotiate minimum patent standards in trade talks 
involving 100 nations and said he is hopeful an agreement can be 
reached by the end of 1990 
in this country perhaps the biggest development came in 1982 
with the creation of a federal appeals court in washington devoted 
solely to intellectual property disputes 
this court has really turned toward lowering the standard of 
patentability and upholding patents said kodaks webster he 
should know the court rejected kodaks appeal of a guilty verdict 
in a suit by polaroid corp that forced it out of instant 
photography 
by aggressively enforcing its patent rights texas instruments 
inc earned almost as much in royalties in 1987 191 million as 
it did from operations last year royalties accounted for a quarter 
of its profits 
lotus development corp and apple computer inc are facing 
criticism for heavyhanded protection of patents on the look and 
feel of their products such as the lotus 123 spreadsheet 
to critics patents protecting look and feel are the 
equivalent of a patent by general motors corp protecting the 
arrangement of the steering wheel brake and gas pedals on a car 
reflecting the turmoil twothirds of big companies in the united 
states canada and europe are enmeshed in litigation over 
intellectual property rights a conference board survey estimates

if theres one thing american automakers 
should be able to do better than japanese rivals its knowing the 
styles american drivers like 
but japans automakers set out to eliminate that advantage by 
establishing design shops in that carcrazed corner of america 
southern california theyve turned out the snazzy prototypes for 
bestsellers like mazdas mx5 miata nissans pathfinder 4x4 
hondas crx and toyotas celica 
the americandesigned japanese cars were so successful that 
detroit was forced to follow suit with its own california design 
studios 
as is increasingly the case in the knowledge economy the big 
three us carmakers found that to stay in the race even in their 
own backyard they have to get smarter about giving consumers what 
they want 
they were too insulated from the popular culture they were 
still living mentally and psychologically in the bloomfield hills 
country club said tony assenza senior editor of car and driver 
magazine speaking of a wealthy detroit suburb 
in the united states everybody looks here for trends said 
hiroshi moriyoshi who heads mazdas southern california design and 
research outpost the whole environment is conducive to 
creativity 
cars are so similar in price and technology that style has become 
more important than ever hence the 14 auto design studios within 
120 freeway miles of los angeles 
detroit for years kept an eye on how californians customize cars 
and hired californiatrained designers part of a watch on trends 
nationwide 
but the japanese were the first to actually set up shop here 
beginning with toyota motor corps calty design research inc in 
newport beach in 1973 honda motor co ltd followed in 1974 with a 
shop in torrance mazda motor corp in 1976 in irvine and nissan 
motor co ltd in 1979 in la jolla 
the studios were small lowprofile seemingly unthreatening 
then the 1978 celica hit the carshow circuit catching the eye 
of auto enthusiasts who tended to look at most japanese products as 
dull compacts meant for the budgetminded 
the japanese companies managed to make compacts stylish turning 
out sporty younglooking cars that young people could afford 
detroit was left wallowing behind 
it was a mindset predicated on the fact that the main car of 
interest to anybody they talked to was a sixpassenger fourdoor 
luxury automobile roughly in the shape of a brick assenza said 
detroit established satellite design studios or beefed up 
informal sampling of the tastes out west 
chrysler corps pacific advanced product design center in 
carlsbad and general motors corps advanced concepts center in 
newbury park sprang up in 1983 followed a year later by ford 
concept center california in valencia 
other japanese makers plus volvo and three independents bring 
the number of design studios in the area to 14 most employ fewer 
than 50 
the japanese had intensely practical reasons for setting up 
design shops in southern california the west coast was already 
their business beachhead in america and the weather was far more 
agreeable than detroits 
but it turns out they landed in the most wideopen auto market in 
the world where designers can sample trends just driving to work 
its the best automotive design melting pot that i can think 
of said fritz mayhew chief design executive at ford motor co in 
detroit who oversees the contributions of the companys california 
designers 
then theres californias role as a crucible of popular culture 
fads trends do start here said ron hill head of the 
industrial design program at the art center college of design in 
pasadena where many car designers get their start people are 
less inhibited to look at the new to express themselves in ways 
theyre not so capable of doing in other parts of the country or the 
world 
among the auto trends traced to california hot rods pickup 
trucks as basic commuter transportation convertible pickups trim 
and grillwork thats painted not chromed the new emphasis on 
comfortable interiors 
nissans pulsar nx a compact with interchangeable tops that 
makes it a convertible a pickup or a station wagon emerged in 
production almost unchanged from the design said gerald hirshberg 
a former gm designer who heads the companys studio in la jolla 
the same was true for the companys brawny americanlooking 
pathfinder 4x4 and hardbody pickups 
mazdas studio employs designers from japan the united states 
and taiwan several have worked in europe 
nissans hirshberg has found the japanese admire their american 
coworkers willingness to take risks in design while the americans 
are taken aback by the japanese ability to translate a design into a 
practical car 
theres a kind of subtle collaboration that can only happen 
when parts of both cultures are put in the frying pan hirshberg 
said you get a tremendous energy burst when you tap into what 
each culture does better

an inventive college dropout with a knack 
for pleasing customers has shown 3m co it doesnt take a lab full 
of moleculeminded phds to blaze trails in technology 
frank marentic earned his science degree on the workbench 
tinkering his way into the automotive design industry and giving 3m 
a foothold there with 18 years of creative work in detroit 
he also invented a dragreduction film known as riblets that 
helped speed stars amp stripes to victory in the 1986 americas cup 
yacht race a public relations dream for the 105 billion 
diversified manufacturer 
hes the last of a breed said clem nelson vice president of 
3ms automotive systems division i dont think 3m will happen to 
see another one like him everyone we hire today is from the 
classroom 
marentic 57 is cherished by 3m for his ability to create the 
hot swatch a rough handmade sample of an emerging product 
hes got great hands said william klein technical director 
of the industrial tape division at 3m a lot of people have ideas 
but we need someone to reduce them to practice 
once an idea is reduced to a swatch customers can seek 
refinements or quickly drop the idea cutting development costs by 
shortening the gestation process or sparing the company the expense 
of making duds 
speed and low cost are important even in research the lifeblood 
of the knowledge economy 
3m the minnesota mining amp manufacturing co spends about 65 
percent of its revenue on research and development more than the 
industry average last year it totaled 689 million 
research and development is an investment but they only want 
to invest a minimum amount of money for a maximum return said 
terry morris a senior development engineer at 3m who has worked 
under marentic since he moved back to the companys maplewood 
headquarters in 1983 
marentic said he has a practical streak that makes 3ms financial 
restraints easier to accept but even in the leanest years he said 
he has been able to cut loose on risky ventures 
riblets for example was born from an initial 600 to 1000 
expense that allowed marentic to meet with navy researchers who had 
theorized that a microscopically fine sawtooth surface could reduce 
drag and save fuel marentic gave the theory life when he suggested 
using a plastic adhesive to create the effect instead of the metal 
envisioned by the navy 
he unsuccessfully tried to apply it to cars during the energy 
crisis and was selling the idea to airplane manufacturers when stars 
amp stripes called 
the 2 months he spent in australia to babysit the yachts hull 
were one of the crowning achievements of his career and two years 
later he received 3ms highest honor the carlton award for career 
contributions in research 
riblets hasnt made money for 3m but marentic still champions it 
as a potential revenue giant because airplane makers are toying with 
it 
if i wouldnt have done this i would have gone into music 
said marentic a former trumpet player whose brother james is a 
professional jazz artist i like the creativity one has in jazz 
what i do is an extension of that 
nelson said marentic is a rarity because he rose to division 
scientist after joining 3m in 1955 as an entrylevel technician he 
had found the university of minnesota boring and quit during his 
freshman year only to be inspired to pursue a scientific career by 
his first 3m boss dick drew the inventor of scotch tape 
we spent up to 15 percent of our time pursuing things that 
were not related to our job function marentic said we were 
allowed to create 
in detroit from 1968 to 1983 marentic headed a research lab that 
gained the respect of automakers for adding decorative touches to 
car bodies one of his first successes was the horseshoeshaped 
stripe on the side of fords 1967 mustang he struck gold for 3m and 
pontiac by developing a strong costefficient technology to 
emblazon the firebird emblem on the cars hood 
i think gm made about 11 million off that car and we made a 
little bit ourselves marentic said 
jeff janssen a senior chemist at 3m said marentic has a hidden 
talent for sales because he gleans information from customers to 
find out what they really want 
but janssen agreed with others that marentics greatest asset is 
his practical creativity 
the molecule guys get too hung up on what they cant do 
janssen said that doesnt stop frank

when prosperity depends on ideas 
higherlearning institutions such as the university of michigan 
become as important as gritty factory towns were during the 
industrial revolution 
corporate research facilities crowding northeast ann arbor are 
proof that knowledge today equals power and profits and college 
towns arent placid bystanders in the brainsoverbrawn brawl 
in recessionary chills of years past manufacturingheavy 
michigan caught economic pneumonia when people delayed big 
purchases like cars michigan shut down it happened in the last 
downturn pushing the states jobless rate as high as 173 percent 
in december 1982 
michigan is hoping to use high technology to diversify the 
economy and avoid that jobless jolt the next time a recession comes 
at the same time theres a statewide effort to make michigans big 
factories more competitive 
success will mean other regions look to michigan for lessons 
state commerce director doug ross said 
with the university of michigan in the lead ann arbor is a major 
source of the technology to restore michigans manufacturing might 
research facilities now dot the university area and form a 
40mile automation alley along interstate 94 from ann arbor to 
detroit their success is reflected in state job figures 
employment that hovered around 35 million jobs in 1982 topped 4 
million in 1986 and has ranged around 43 million in 1989 the 
highest ever recorded in michigan 
the number of jobless which reached 749000 in december 1982 
has dipped below 300000 in two months this year for the first time 
since 1978 seasonally adjusted employment rates from the us 
bureau of labor statistics have dropped as low as 61 percent 
the muchmaligned rust belt starts with innate advantages built 
up over time and sometimes not appreciated until a company moves 
said j downs herold who manages the universitys industrial 
development research program 
what you have here are a lot of little tool and die shops and 
model makers herold said the amount of expertise that exists 
among these places in heattreating sandblasting the ability to 
bend and mold metals of all types thats an infrastructure you 
dont just start out and build 
it may seem worthwhile at first to move elsewhere for lower 
labor costs for example herold said but when you need something 
special you dont just run down the street and say i wonder if 
charlie can do that its probably the same thing if youre out in 
california and want to develop a new electronic chip 
to add the advanced technology edge the universitys college of 
engineering emphasizes research contracts with auto chemical 
electronics computer and aerospace companies including general 
motors corp ford motor co chrysler corp and dow chemical co 
said robert w schneider director of corporate relations at the 
college 
students pursue realworld investigations in their area of 
interest and the research provides material for phd theses 
sometimes research leads to postgraduate employment 
one gm project with the college led to a computer software system 
that reschedules plant operations in case of an equipment breakdown 
to keep turning out the mostneeded products 
gm has similar programs with other schools such as rensselaer 
polytechnic institute in troy ny massachusetts institute of 
technology in cambridge mass and stanford university in palo 
alto calif 
gm assigns experienced engineers usually with advanced degrees 
to work with the students said jim caie director of advanced 
manufacturing engineering at gm 
we certainly arent dummies we are really in most cases on the 
cutting edge of technology he said we need to leverage 
ourselves as much as possible get good people from the 
universities helping us we cant do it all ourselves 
the university of michigans intellectual properties office has 
expanded from one parttime staffer 10 years ago to 10 people today 
its royalty income from faculty inventions rose 66 percent in 1987 
and another 10 percent last year to 850000 
what youre finding is that intellectual property issues are 
becoming increasingly important in american business said bob 
gavin director of the office that is a function of the united 
states recognizing that it has to protect its knowledge because that 
is the basis of its future economy 
patented items include a fluid that gets thicker or thinner 
depending on an electrical charge applied to it 
auto companies are vitally interested in how it could be used in 
hydraulics said frederick h reinhart jr marketing director of 
the intellectual properties office 
besides ideas ann arbor has also become the home of an awful 
lot of new industries where people get an idea and spin something 
off said herold the university industrial development official 
in a coup with a ripple effect the university also helped lure 
the us environmental protection agencys auto emissions laboratory 
that led to establishment of a string of laboratories by auto 
companies especially importers that wanted to tinker with cars 
failing to meet us emissions requirements without taking them home

chris peters stretched for words as he 
tried to describe how he makes his living 
its hard to even explain sometimes what youre thinking when 
youre writing a program said peters a software developer for 
microsoft corp youre not thinking in english its hard even to 
describe the thought process 
you actually are the computer at the point youre writing the 
program 
whether or not he can articulate it peters can do it hes one 
of just 12 computer programmers who work on the microsoft excel 
spreadsheet program 
the bookkeeping program is one of microsofts key products its 
weapon for capturing market share from lotus development corps 
123 the bestselling spreadsheet program 
as much as any modern product software epitomizes what is meant 
by the knowledge economy 
microsoft and other software companies physical products are but 
a few dollars worth of magnetic tape or disks a manual and a 
catchy package 
what people pay for is the computer code the abstraction of a 
physical process such as recordkeeping that allows a computer and 
its operator to do complex functions in split seconds 
the raw materials are the ideas of the companies programmers and 
engineers marketers and managers its what their people know and 
how well they can express it that brings in the money 
founded just 15 years ago by william gates and paul allen 
microsoft is now the largest company specializing in personal 
computer software 
gates and allen also provided an informationage legend a couple 
of college kids who wrote a language program for a computer they 
read about in an electronics magazine and turned that asset into a 
corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
gates stock made him the youngest selfmade billionaire ever 
programmers all over the country working at the kitchen table or 
small offices still try to emulate gates but in the big leagues 
where programs can reach 450000 lines of computer code making 
software has long since expanded from a onebrain concoction 
at microsofts headquarters in a firshaded suburban seattle 
office park the workfloor for excel is a long hallway lined with 
compact offices the wing has the atmosphere of graduate student 
cubicles in a large university if theres a college where students 
can afford bmws 
down the hall is a room with pinball and video games standard 
office decor is mounds of paper and three to six personal computers 
one programmer eddy fries has turned an old computer monitor into 
a tropical fishbowl 
the flip side of the frisbees and amateur jugglers who come out 
on nice days is an intensity where arguments and egos can flare and 
work can go on around the clock to make deadlines 
thats what comes in a company where the norm is neargenius 
level and not just in smarts but in creativity and everything 
else peters said 
if you love what youre doing and people say oh but youre 
at work all the time well yeah right this is fun right 
peters 31 joined the company in 1981 as the 100th employee and 
is now about 40th in seniority in a company that employs about 3800 
what keeps him he said is that microsoft and gates himself a 
programmer treat software writers like prima donnas 
stewart alsop publisher of the industry newsletter pc letter 
agrees while microsoft executives may give speeches about the need 
for industry standards alsop says that doesnt stop their own 
developers from violating the rules if the program demands it 
they focus on the very essentials of software does it do what 
people want it to do 
microsoft assigns far fewer programmers to a team than do other 
software giants where lotus has 12 to more than 30 programmers 
working on versions of 123 microsofts 12member team creates all 
three forms of excel for apple macintosh msdos and os2 
operating systems plus foreign translations 
although lotus teams are larger frank ingari vice president 
for lotus personal spreadsheet computer division agrees you cant 
get quality by designing by committee 
no matter how many are on the team you find a small number who 
are the actual architects he said 
peters said 95 percent of writing the intricate code that makes a 
program work is simply an individual programmer staring at a screen 
puzzling it out until the solution comes hell sit there and 
hell think real hard and he might walk around the halls he might 
find some guy and corner him and just talk at him 
hallways are a big deal at microsoft peters said you work 
privately but together its kind of weird 
though programmers build new features on blocks of code written 
before and may use programs to edit and search code for bugs 
peters doesnt put much faith in programs that claim to actually 
write software 
no we do it the oldfashioned way i mean what kind of junk 
would be generated by a machine 
in a way peters said writing software is like designing a 
building bad code is an awful bit of carpentry that wont hold 
the roof up its also like mastering a foreign language it 
takes a few years to even know how to read the stuff and know that 
its good 
or maybe he said its like composing music 
the stuff can be very beautiful and the funny thing the user 
never sees it peters said you can look at someones code and 
it will flow there will just be this elegance to it

financially troubled trustcorp has agreed to 
be bought by society corp in a stockswap deal valued at about 495 
million both companies said today 
the announcement follows months of speculation that toledobased 
trustcorp might be a takeover target due to its financial woes 
which included writeoffs of 76 million in bad real estate loans 
over the past five months 
trustcorp also recently added 24 million to its loanloss 
reserves 
under the buyout clevelandbased society agreed to swap 
threequarters of of its common shares for each of trustcorps 
shares society also was given the option of buying unissued 
trustcorp common shares equal to 249 percent of the total 
outstanding shares 
the combined bank holding company will have about 16 billion in 
assets 
chester devenow trustcorps interim president and chief 
executive officer called the deal a tremdous step forward 
we are not giving up ownership of this bank he said we 
believe our partnership with a quality company like society corp 
will be in the best interest of our shareholders our customers our 
employees and the communities we serve 
society chairman robert w gillespie chairman and chief 
executive officer of society corp said substantial additional 
contributions to trustcorps loanloss reserve would be necessary 
he told a news conference he understood the problems trustcorp 
has had with bad loans 
theyre recognized we want to put it behind us by the end of 
the year its a chapter that needs to be closed gillespie said 
six of trustcorps top executives including george haigh former 
president chairman and chief executive officer resigned or were 
fired in the wake of the losses 
the 76 million in writeoffs resulted in a drop in trustcorps 
overall earnings in 1988 to 13 million or 8 cents a share 
compared with 478 million or 291 a share in 1987 
in addition the insitutions earnings dropped nearly 5 million 
in the first quarter of 1989 
william prebe an independent financial consultant and university 
of toledo economics professor said society likely would transfer 
some of trustcorps toledo operations to cleveland 
if they are bottom line oriented and look to trim expenses and 
costs obviously the first place they will trim will be toledo he 
said they are not going to trim society in cleveland

nwa inc the parent of northwest airlines 
and a group led by investor alfred checchi announced an agreement 
today under which checchis group would buy the nations 
fourthlargest airline for 405 billion 
the 121ashare bid by checchis group wings holding inc 
defeated at least three other nwa suitors rival airline pan am 
corp the international association of machinists which represents 
many northwest workers and oil billionaire marvin davis 
none of the three immediately responded to the announcement 
on wall street investors reacted positively to the deal bidding 
nwa stock up 7 a share to 11462 today on the new york stock 
exchange 
checchis group which already owns 49 percent of nwas stock 
was to begin a tender offer within five days paying 37 billion 
for 305 million outstanding shares 
the financial package includes additional equity that would boost 
the total price to 405 billion the investor group said it is 
obtaining financing from commercial banks led by bankers trust co 
northwest also announced that its board approved a 
recapitalization plan that would be implemented if the transaction 
with the checchi group is not completed 
checchi told the associated press today that he would not change 
nwas management led by chairman steven rothmeier 
i talked to steve last night and we mutually congratulated each 
other checchi said i certainly hope he plans on staying i 
have no reason to believe he is not 
in addition checchi said there are no plans to move northwest 
headquarters from eagan a southern minneapolis suburb 
the announcement ended weeks of speculation about northwests 
future 
the magnitude of the equity to be invested in our transaction 
demonstrates our commitment to a responsible capital structure that 
will ensure that nwa will continue as a financially sound growing 
entity checchi a former marriott corp executive considered by 
the airline as a friendly bidder said in a prepared statement 
our financing plan has been designed to accommodate a program 
of substantial growth including all of the new aircraft purchases 
contemplated by nwas management he said 
equity investors in checchis group wings holding inc include 
checchi and his associates klm royal dutch airlines bankers trust 
co richard c blum and associates a san francisco merchant 
banking and investment firm and elders finance group the 
announcement said 
klm could never exert control over northwest because federal 
regulations limit foreign ownership to a maximum of 25 percent 
barbara beyer of avmark inc an aviation consulting firm in 
arlington va has said northwest and klm could work together by 
sharing gates and coordinating schedules for connecting flights the 
arrangement would not result in any merger of employees or corporate 
staff she said 
federal regulators are expected to scrutinize the proposal 
applying a financial fitness test to the group the fear is that too 
much takeover debt could limit a new owners ability to properly 
maintain equipment 
takeover debt also is a concern among northwest pilots who fear 
that a highly leveraged acquisition of the airline would prompt the 
sale of routes or other major assets 
ht dodge and kirk faupel leaders of the 5000member air line 
pilots association unit at northwest have threatened to strike if 
the deal approved by nwas board involves too much debt 
pilots wield some power in the takeover battle because they have 
an open contract unless northwest settles with the union the new 
owner would have the task of combining the expired contracts of 
former republic airlines pilots with those of former northwest

share prices closed higher on monday as a steady 
performance by the british currency helped the market shrug off the 
slump in support for the governing conservative party revealed in 
the european election results 
but trading remained quiet through the day with a handful of the 
leading stocks accounting for much of the days trading volume 
the conservative partys share of the vote slumped in the 
european parliament elections but market analysts said the election 
reverse was widely forecast and didnt necessarily indicate voting 
trends for the next general election due to be held at some point 
before mid1992 
the pounds resilience eased fears that a poor election result 
would contribute to another slide in the currency and pressure the 
government to raise interest rates again said jeffrey thompson an

points or 05 percent higher at 21547 volume came to 3603

some us businesses are slowly resuming their 
operations in china although most are holding off as they monitor 
the countrys shifting political climate following the governments 
bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
there are some americans back martin weil a spokesman for 
the washingtonbased united stateschina business council said 
monday 
companies that already have investments there or urgent 
business reasons to get their people there quickly logically 
youll expect to see them back in beijing before others 
but i think right now most companies are still in a 
waitandsee mode 
hundreds of joint ventures worth billions of dollars were put on 
hold or severely curtailed after chinese troops quashed a 
prodemocracy uprising killing hundreds of its citizens earlier 
this month many companies evacuated their employees en masse 
particularly in beijing 
chinas tourist trade which earned more than 2 billion in 
foreign currency annually for the chinese also was severely 
damaged and the outlook remains uncertain 
a number of usbased companies said most of their employees 
were back to work in china and many of their operations have resumed 
amid increasing signs of stability 
we have told them employees in beijing they can go back 
said an official for los angelesbased occidental petroleum corp 
who asked that he not be identified 
he said work also was continuing in its normal course in an 
openpit mine about 230 miles southwest of the chinese capital 
meanwhile most of the 40 expatriates who had nearly finished 
erecting shanghais tallest building a 175 million 50story 
business complex planned to head back to work by midweek said 
aj robinson executive vice president of portman overseas of 
atlanta which is overseeing the project 
those of us who are committed to china business over the long 
term think whatever has happened is a temporary aberration 
robinson said were in this for the long haul the next 25 
years 
virginia kamsky a new york consultant who assists companies 
doing business in china said the chinese have been bending over 
backwards to be more flexible than ever since the latest wave of 
repression began 
payment under bank of china letters of credit has been coming 
in faster than ever she said usually it takes us exporters 
11 to 14 days to get paid but now the chinese have cut out a step 
and payment is coming through in only five to six days 
not everyone however was ready to continue operations in china 
were watching the situation in china on a daybyday basis 
said donald n hanson a spokesman for long beach califbased 
mcdonnell douglas corp which recently evacuated its 50 chinese 
employees 
most of our people are in hong kong and trying to do work from 
there in terms of getting all of the planning done and the 
preparations made so that when they do get back they can pick up 
where they left off

the bush administration said monday that 
americans should continue avoiding china even if the turmoil there 
appears to have temporarily subsided 
at the same time administration officials rejected a suggestion 
by house speaker thomas s foley dwash that president bush 
intensify his condemnation of the beijing government in view of the 
recent death sentences for student dissidents 
i think weve said everything we have to say on china the 
presidents quite clear on that deputy press secretary roman 
popadiuk told a white house briefing 
overall the bush administration maintained its reserve about 
developments in china 
the president is quite anxious we not do anything that would 
hurt the chinese people secretary of state james a baker iii 
said 
the united states has been speaking out weve been speaking 
out quite vigorously baker said in response to reporters 
questions 
popadiuk disputed a report that bush was appalled by faulty us 
intelligence reports on china including an erroneous dispatch that 
chinese leader deng xiaoping had lapsed into a coma 
the report in the current issue of us news amp world report 
said that bush who headed the cia in the ford administration 
intended to replace cia director william webster by years end 
the cia is doing a superb job popadiuk said there is no 
truth to the article and the president supports director webster 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that 
despite what she called a pause in antius propaganda over the 
weekend the situation in china remains far from normal 
the departments travel advisory warning americans against 
travel to china remains in effect she said we are not going to 
lift our travel advisory 
asked if she had any advice for us businesses wanting to 
return ms tutwiler said we cannot be encouraging americans to 
go back to china when we have a state department policy warning 
advising them not to travel in china 
both white house and state department officials said that no new 
sanctions were planned against the beijing government beyond the 
halt in military sales announced two weeks ago by bush despite a 
call over the weekend by foley for a more aggressive us stance 
the president has spoken very succinctly on this how he 
views this relationship how important this relationship is between 
these two countries he has said he did not want to do anything 
to hurt the chinese people that that is where we are ms 
tutwiler said 
foley interviewed sunday on nbcs meet the press said bush 
should be speaking out more forcefully in opposition to the harsh 
chinese crackdown on prodemocracy dissidents 
the speaker also said the united states should break relations 
immediately with china if the chinese use violence against the us 
embassy in beijing to seize dissident fang lizhi who sought refuge 
there two weeks ago 
the us decision to harbor fang and his wife li shuxian has 
angered the chinese leadership which has accused the united states 
of interfering in chinas internal affairs 
fang remains in the us embassy officials said 
ms tutwiler would not comment on whether the state department 
had urged fangs son against a trip to washington im not going 
to take responsiblity for somehow maybe getting someones personal 
safety in jeopardy she said 
ms tutwiler also said that tough new restrictions by china on 
obtaining exit visas for chinese who wish to leave the country due 
to take effect on tuesday had produced extremely long lines at the 
visa office in shanghai

a federal bankruptcy judge issued a 
restraining order monday to temporarily block developer donald 
trumps 63 million bid to buy the debtridden elsinore atlantis 
casino hotel in atlantic city nj 
us district court judge rosemary gambardella issued the 10day 
order after a brief hearing ruling that irreparable harm and 
injury will result if the deal is allowed to proceed without 
additional hearings 
creditors hold a 65 million mortgage on three atlantis parking 
lots they requested the order preventing new jerseys casino 
control commission a stateappointed conservator and elsinore shore 
associates owners of the boardwalk property from transferring the 
property to trump 
the judge scheduled a hearing for june 29 she will then consider 
extending the restraining order and whether or not additional bids 
should be solicited for the failing property 
edward j didonato a philadelphia attorney who represents the 
three creditors said after the hearing he was pleased with the 
ruling 
it gives us what we originally hoped for that is notice to 
creditors and hopefully a higher and better offer didonato said 
trump plans to close the casino and convert the gaming complex 
into a luxury hotel 
arthur sklar an attorney representing donald j trump 
acquisitions which is handling the purchase of the atlantis 
declined to comment on whether the restraining order would affect 
the deal he said the sale is set for closing on july 7 
on friday new jersey gaming regulators ended a monthlong 
struggle over the atlantis approving trumps bid by a 50 vote the 
casino control commission said it did not believe trump was gaining 
too much power in atlantic city when it approved the purchase by the 
billionaire developer 
trump owns two atlantic city casinos and has a third under 
construction if he buys the atlantis it would give him control of 
34 percent of casino hotel rooms 31 percent of casino floor space 
and revenue and 48 percent of casino meeting and exhibition space 
according to commission statistics 
sklar said elsinore which emerged from bankruptcy reorganization 
last fall planned to formally ask ms gambardella to approve the 
sale of the atlantis which has debts estimated at 150 million 
didonato however said his clients did not receive adequate 
notice of details of the agreement with trump which was announced a 
day after the casinos gaming license expired 
in april the atlantis became the first new jersey gaming house 
to fail to get its regular license renewed since legal casino 
gambling began in atlantic city in 1978 
the state ordered the casino to shut down last month ruling that 
the gaming halls financial situation was too marginal to allow it 
to continue operations

trustcorp inc which has been rocked by bad 
loans has agreed to be bought by society corp of cleveland in a 
stockswap deal worth about 495 million company officials 
announced monday 
the agreement was approved sunday night by the boards of 
directors of both companies said robert w gillespie chairman of 
society corp 
the deal which still needs to be approved by trustcorp 
shareholders and the federal reserve board should be closed by the 
end of the year gillespie said 
from societys perspective its the first time weve ventured 
outside of the borders of ohio we think its a teriffic way for us 
to enter into the interstate regional banking activities 
gillespie said at a news conference 
society said the deal would expand the bank holding company into 
two new markets indiana and michigan 
toledobased trustcorp reeling from bad loans on development 
projects said the merger was in the best interest of its 
shareholders 
this is not a disaster said chester devenow trustcorps 
interim president and chief executive officer i am very pleased 
with whats happened here i feel very comfortable that its in the 
best interest of our shareholders and employees but also for the 
city of toledo were not giving up ownership of this bank 
under the agreement holders of trustcorp common shares will 
receive three fourths of a society common share for each share of 
trustcorp common stock society will pay about 30 a share for 
nearly 16 million shares of trustcorp stock 
the combined operation will have about 16 billion in assets 
trustcorp shareholders will hold about 35 percent of societys 
stock after the merger and will be represented on societys board 
trustcorp bank of ohio a trustcorp inc subsidiary would be 
absorbed into the society system while trustcorp inc would be 
dissolved frederick teal chairman of societys bank in columbus

gillespie said 
its not our intention for trustcorp to become a branch office 
of a cleveland company we intend to run trustcorp of ohio as a 
standalone independent bank he said 
the decision to sell trustcorp follows months of speculation that 
the holding company would be the target of a takeover because of 
financial troubles 
trustcorp in the last five months had to write off 76 million 
because of the bad loans the company took 52 million in writeoffs 
and added 24 million to its loanloss reserves 
a writeoff is a loan that no longer is expected to be repaid and 
written off as a bad debt 
the losses were blamed on loans on real estate development 
projects particularly in downtown toledo trustcorp had loaned 
about 100 million to various downtown toledo projects during the 
last decade 
six of trustcorps top executives including george haigh former 
president chairman and chief executive officer resigned or were 
fired in the wake of the losses 
gillespie said trustcorp had several nonbanking operations that 
would enhance societys business including an insurance agency a 
travel agency and an investment advisory unit 
society said the merger would make it the thirdlargest bank 
holding company in ohio and the 40th in the nation society now 
ranks fourth in ohio and 54th in the nation

ohio indiana michgan and florida

sematech said monday it has held preliminary talks 
with european manufacturers on cooperation in research on 
semiconductor manufacturing technology 
representatives of european integrated circuit companies 
visited sematech to discuss opportunities for cooperation between 
sematech and jessi joint european submicron silicon the us 
consortium said monday in a prepared statement 
it was agreed that any potential cooperation must be based on 
reciprocity it was also agreed that such cooperation is highly 
desirable 
a study group was set up to further define the areas where 
common activities can substantially help in reaching mutual goals 
the statement said 
the meeting at sematechs austin headquarters occurred last 
friday and involved representatives of nv philips a dutch company 
siemens ag west germany and sgsthomson microelectronics bv 
according to sematech spokesman miller bonner 
however bonner noted that the three while they account for the 
bulk of the european industry do not represent jessi which is 
still in the formative stages 
bonner said the meeting grew out of contacts with potential jessi 
members who were seeking help in setting up a sematechlike effort 
to battle the japanese for the 45 billion semiconductor industry 
sematech an acronym for semiconductor manufacturing technology 
was created last year with a goal of us global leadership in the 
semiconductor manufacturing technology by 1993 
although the europeans in some ways are competing with the united 
states for that leadership bonner said sematechs focus on 
manufacturing technology and not on the enduse of computer chips 
means cooperation would not be inconsistent with sematechs goal 
if our goal is to retain world leadership in the semiconductor 
manufacturing clearly we have to take a very broad view of the best 
way to accomplish this bonner said 
but bonner disputed a report in this weeks issue of business 
week magazine that the talks would lead to joint membership in both 
consortia for the 14 us companies and their european counterparts 
thats a giant leap from what we talked about here on friday 
bonner said were a long way from talking about joint membership 
theres one thing to discuss standards its quite another to talk 
about joint membership 
sematechs members include international business machines corp 
american telephone amp telegraph co ncr corp texas instruments 
inc digital equipment inc motorola inc hewlettpackard co 
and intel corp the members fund half of sematechs 200 million 
annual budget with the pentagon contributing the remainder

the government is hoping early renewal of an 
inflationfighting pact will ease anxiety over prolonged foreign 
debt negotiations and bolster its position in the talks 
the latest extension of the pact announced late sunday makes no 
major changes in the one that expires july 31 
prices will be held at current levels and the onepesoaday 
devaluation of the countrys currency against the us dollar will 
be maintained the pact says it mentions no new minimum wage 
increase 
an agreement between the government and foreign commercial banks 
on their share of the countrys 1074 billion foreign debt had been 
expected before the renewal was announced analysts say investors 
had become nervous over what both might contain prompting the 
government to keep domestic interest rates high to keep capital in 
the country 
the renewed pact strengthens mexicos negotiating position on 
foreign debt salinas said in a televised speech after the signing 
negotiations between representatives of the government and the 
more than 500 foreign commercial creditor banks are under way in new 
york private banks hold about 70 percent of the foreign debt 
unity among labor private enterprise the farm sector and the 
government in bringing down inflation through the series of pacts 
has won recognition from foreign governments and multilateral 
lending agencies salinas said and now opens a new space for us 
to not accept under pressure just any arrangement but on the 
contrary to reach an adequate agreement 
inflation was running at a record annual rate of 159 percent when 
the first pact was signed in december 1987 the rate was 8 percent 
for the first five months of this year and 185 percent for the 12 
months ending in may reducing inflation further and gradually 
renewing economic growth stagnant from 1982 to 1988 remain the 
pacts priorities salinas said 
the international monetary fund and world bank have granted 
mexico new loans totaling about 58 billion 
manuel sanchez director of the center for economic research and 
analysis a private think tank said in an interview that shortterm 
anxiety will ease if investors see that the government is 
negotiating a solid longterm agreement on the debt continuing 
structural changes such as reducing its role in the economy and 
holding down its own spending also will boost investor confidence 
he said 
salinas who took office last dec 1 wants an agreement that 
will cover the rest of his sixyear term 
government officials have indicated they are holding out for a 55 
percent reduction in principal on the loans held by private banks 
the banks are reported to have offered a 22 percent reduction on at 
least part of the debt

united steelworkers members rejected a 50month 
contract offer from national steel corp that was patterned after an 
agreement ratified at bethlehem steel corp union officials said 
monday 
union negotiator buddy davis said the nearly 7000 members at 
nationals plants in ecorse mich portage ind and granite city 
ill apparently believed they could get better terms from the 
nations sixthlargest steelmaker 
one of the problems with these early negotiations is that 
people get to thinking well we dont have anything to lose so 
lets send them back to get us some more well there isnt any 
more at least thats what ive been telling them davis said 
before the ballot had been finished at a pittsburgh hotel davis 
said if it goes down id say theyre in trouble 
the vote was 3239 to 2054 to reject the restoration of previous 
concessions and raise wages by 150 an hour over the life of the 
contract like three other major producers national faced a july 31 
contract expiration 
if the union members at our divisions voted against the 
agreement because they believe national can afford to give more 
theyre wrong said dick coffee chief negotiator for 
pittsburghbased national 
national is already one of the less profitable producers among 
the major companies 
the two sides opened negotiations early and presumably will 
return to bargaining after a cooling off period 
secondranked bethlehem won ratification of terms similar to 
nationals offer 
meanwhile the union continues negotiations with inland steel 
industries inc although the chicago company has been taking a 
tough line and union officials have been telling workers that 
strike preparations have begun 
inland claims it is offering terms at least as good as 
bethlehems the union claims its workers deserve better from a 
financially healthy company 
the two sides bargained over the weekend and through the night 
until 5 am monday in chicago the negotiators then recessed to 
rest 
talks with armco inc were scheduled to resume tuesday but have 
been postponed until after july 4 because of a shortage of hotel

the agreement is between pipeline builders kern river gas 
transmission co and mojave pipeline co and includes southern 
california gas co the big utility 
it calls for each pipeline company to build its own line to the

burned to produce steam that is used to extract thick tarlike oil 
from the ground under the southern san joaquin valley

williams cos of tulsa okla would bring natural gas from opal 
wyo mojave owned by houstonbased enron corp and el paso natural 
gas co a subsidiary of burlington resources would bring gas from 
topock ariz 
any such pipeline into the state must be approved by the federal 
energy regulatory commission which has approved one similar 
application and is considering another by the states other big gas 
utility pacific gas amp electric co 
another competitor the wyomingcalifornia pipeline co has won 
ferc approval for a line from wyoming that company a subsidiary of

owners of 30 us plants acknowledge releasing 
annually at least 1 million pounds each of chemicals suspected of 
causing cancer according to federal figures disclosed monday by a 
private group 
the releases contribute to more than 27 billion pounds of toxic 
chemicals that the environmental protection agency says are put into 
the air from industrial sources each year including some 360 
million pounds of suspected carcinogens 
the finding based on statistics provided by the industry on 
releases in 1987 are the most detailed and most current breakdown 
to date epa officials said 
charles elkins director of the epas toxics programs said the 
raw figures do not measure individuals health risks because they do 
not take into account exposure levels 
neither the epa statistics nor the analysis by the private 
environmental group the natural resources defense council 
attempted to deal with the exposure question 
but david doniger an attorney for the private group which 
released a plantbyplant list said these pollutants have to be 
considered dangerous at any level of exposure 
doniger criticized the epa for not having moved more swiftly to 
regulate such chemical releases 
a spokesman for one company cited boeing military airplanes of 
wichita kan said the company uses trichloroethylene in solvents 
for cleaning aircraft parts and to help prevent corrosion 
boeing is trying to develop substitutes said richard hill 
adding that the emissions figure seems like a lot but to put it 
into perspective that total amount is spread out throughout the 
course of a year by the time the air leaves the plant grounds it is 
diluted to the point the chemical is undetectable 
the findings mirror many of the conclusions reached earlier this 
month by rep henry waxman dcalif who said that data he had 
obtained from the epa indicated more than 200 industrial plants 
across the country may be releasing chemicals that pose a severe 
cancer risk 
but waxmans data from the epa were for the early 1980s and were 
largely based on rough working estimates and not widespread 
reporting of actual releases said epa spokesman john kasper 
meanwhile on monday the epa announced the start of an 
information system that shortly will allow citizens to more easily 
learn what industrial chemicals they may be exposed to in their 
areas 
a computerized inventory showing releases of 328 chemicals by 
20000 plants and facilities nationwide will soon be available at 
1000 federal libraries and through many local library systems said 
epa officials 
the system will allow someone to find out in minutes what toxic 
chemicals and volume of releases were reported to the epa by plants 
in the area 
the nrdc analysis monday was based on that toxic release 
inventory epa officials said 
but the environmental group focused on only 13 chemicals that the 
epa as far back as 1985 has classified as either being proven 
carcinogens or strongly suspected of causing cancer 
only one of the chemicals is currently regulated as to releases 
into the air and even in that case benzene releases are not 
prohibited entirely 
officials said all the reported releases were legal 
among the findings of the nrdc in its analysis of the epas 
statistics were 
there are at least 1600 industrial plants and facilities in 46 
states that release significant amounts of suspected cancercausing 
chemicals into the air 
releases of 400000 pounds or more were reported by 125 plants 
including 30 that reported 1 million pounds or more 
the most widely polluted chemical among the 13 examined was 
methylene chloride a volatile cleaning solvent used as a metal 
degreaser paint remover and in aerosols the epa has classified it 
as a probable human carcinogen 
according to the nrdc analysis the largest polluter with a 
single chemical on the list was the eastman kodak co in rochester 
ny which reported releasing nearly 9 million pounds of methylene 
chloride in 1987 
other companies which reported emissions of more than 25 million 
pounds were ge plastics of mount vernon ind the upjohn co 
portage mich eli lilly amp co clinton and shadeland ind and 
hadco corp derry nh 
all of those involved methylene chloride 
the top polluter for each of the other 12 chemicals was 
borgwarner chemical inc washington wva acrylonitrile 114 
million pounds texaco chemical co port neches texas 13 
butadiene 960000 pounds monsanto co soda spring idaho

ford motor co will increase the overseas content 
of two large cars while putting more domestic parts in two small 
vehicles to meet a more stringent federal fuel economy standard an 
official said monday 
as a result the larger cars will be reclassified as imports in 
federal fuel economy calculations while the smaller cars now listed 
as imports will be counted as domestic 
the reclassifications will be made despite the fact that the 
large cars are assembled in ontario not considered foreign for 
carclassification purposes and that one of the small cars is made 
in mexico said joel pitcoff of the automakers research staff 
ford will reduce the share of north americanmade components in 
the ford crown victoria and mercury grand marquis from about 90 
percent to just under 75 percent pitcoff said 
the change which will occur early in 1991 will be offset by an 
increase in the north american content of the smaller ford probe and 
mercury tracer so that both qualify as domestic vehicles even 
though the tracer is assembled in mexico pitcoff said 
the net domestic content of the four vehicles will be higher 
than it is today pitcoff said he said less than half of the 
content of the two smaller models now comes from north american 
sources 
ford is selling crown victorias and grand marquis at a rate of 
225000250000 a year about the same as the total for the probe 
and tracer he said 
under a 1975 federal law automakers will be required to have a 
corporate average fuel economy of 275 miles per gallon for the 1990 
model year the transportation department now holds producers to a 
265 mpg standard 
the socalled cafe standard has different requirements for 
domestically made cars those with at least 75 percent north 
american content and cars imported under the companys name plates 
with fewer than 75 percent north american parts 
ford now barely meets the fuel economy standard for domestically 
made cars with a 266 mpg average but safely exceeds it for imports 
at about 32 mpg pitcoff said 
a united auto workers spokesman at the unions convention in 
anaheim calif criticized fords moves 
the uaw continues to be concerned about jobs for us 
workers said the spokesman who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity domestic manufacturers have trouble meeting cafe 
standards because they import far too many small cars now they 
propose to import big cars as well 
we are concerned that this will further erode the jobs of our 
members 
the next generation of the crown victoria and grand marquis is 
scheduled to go into production in early 1991 in st thomas 
ontario the probe is built for ford by mazda motor corp at its 
flat rock plant south of detroit while the tracer is assembled in 
hermosillo mexico 
sales leader general motors corp like no 2 ford is struggling 
to comply with current fuel economy standards and says it will have 
trouble meeting the higher 1990 standard no 3 chrysler corp sells 
fewer large fuelhungry cars and hasnt faced any difficulty 
meeting the cafe limits

newly elected house majority leader 
richard gephardt on monday ticked off a campaignstyle list of 
things wrong with the united states and asked the united auto 
workers union to help him set things straight 
gephardt making his first major speech since taking the house 
democratic leadership position two weeks ago told delegates to a 
uaw convention that the bush administration has made some good 
sounds on trade 
it remains to be seen if they are tough he added if not 
were going to have the gephardt amendment or something like it 
the congressman from missouri based a large part of his 
unsuccessful presidential campaign last year on trade issues the 
legislation he proposed in congress would have forced the president 
to take action against countries that traded unfairly with the 
united states 
you cannot compete against unfair competition he said to 
applause from a crowd of about 2000 uaw members 
in an address sounding much like a political stump speech 
gephardt criticized the bush administration saying the nation 
needed a comprehensive energy policy and to divert spending from 
military hardware to education and the fight against drugs 
this is our time to make america great and good and strong 
again he said 
earlier monday a uaw dissident movement was dealt its second 
blow in two days when convention delegates rejected efforts which 
would have required direct election of national union officers 
the oneman onevote issue came up in 30 resolutions 
submitted to the convention they were lumped together and turned 
down in a showofhands vote 
the conventions constitution committee recommended rejection of 
the move to referendum voting for national officers 
a referendum is only the outer shell of democracy jim mcneil 
of local 600 in dearborn mich said in reading the committees 
report 
the convention system delivers the substance he said 
the uaw membership elects its officers through delegates to the 
convention every three years this years elections are scheduled 
for wednesday and president owen bieber is facing no oppositon 
the new directions dissident movement led by jerry tucker of st 
louis has complained among other things that the union has lost its 
democratic roots 
dan mallett a delegate from local 31 in fairfax kan said a 
referendum method would make the unions leadership more accountable 
to the membership 
they pay their union dues they deserve the right to vote he 
said 
but his arguments and those of others failed to persuade enough 
delegates to pass the resolution 
it was the second defeat for tucker and his forces in as many 
days on sunday the conventions opening day new directions 
backers lost a battle over seating some delegations at that time 
tucker said there would be other challenges from his camp during the 
weeklong convention 
before the debate on the referendum issue former rep barbara 
jordan of texas praised the union and its leadership her remarks 
were framed in references to recent events in china in which a 
prodemocracy student demonstration was put down forcefully 
you in the united auto workers have a responsibility to explain 
democracy of the rest of the world she said because you are a 
microcosm of democracy

savings and loan of pine bluff were indicted monday on federal 
charges of fraudulent management and conspiracy 
howard j wiechern jr former chairman of the board and chief 
executive officer and roderick d reed iii former president and 
chief operating officer are accused of concealing information from 
the federal home loan bank board falsifying entries in firstsouth 
records and misapplying funds 
us attorney chuck banks said the investigation was continuing 
and that additional indictments were possible 
the federal home loan bank board took control of firstsouth on 
dec 5 1986 in what at the time was the largest sampl failure in 
us history

stockholders as george s watson of dallas a starke taylor iii of 
dallas and jerry l grigsby of malvern 
two of the indictments five counts charge that wiechern and reed 
conspired to conceal from federal regulators and firstsouth 
shareholders and directors a secret agreement not to pursue the 
guarantees securing loans made to watson and taylor for the watson 
and taylor realty co in dallas 
the indictment alleges the loans were then listed as income on 
firstsouth records to avoid showing a major decline in earnings for 
the fiscal year ending june 30 1985 
the third count alleges reed made three loans in excess of 20 
million to grigsby in violation of federal regulatory requirements 
without board approval and for purposes other than what was stated

wildcat strikes hit coal fields in four 
more states monday keeping a third of the nations union miners out 
of work despite a backtowork request by united mine workers 
leadership 
but monday night a judge deprived the wildcat strikers of a 
major reason for their walkout by releasing three union leaders 
whod been jailed for encouraging miners to violate a court order 
against blocking mine entrances in virginia 
us district judge glen williams order could end the wildcat 
strikes that have spread to nine states said chuck donnelly an 
attorney for the united mine workers 
marty hudson the primary strike coordinator from washington 
jackie stump president of the umws southwest virginia district 
and ca phillips a umw international representative left the 
roanoke va jail 
it sounds like a cause for celebration donnelly said 
umw vice president cecil roberts said earlier monday that 
telegrams were sent to the sympathy strikers asking them to return 
to work in accordance with a national contract forbidding such a 
walkout 
telegrams have gone out said roberts breaking the unions 
long silence on the impromptu strikes that have shut down more than 
300 mines im sure that that has taken place throughout the 
union 
despite the request mines in alabama illinois missouri and 
ohio were hit monday for the first time bringing out 5000 more 
united mine workers members in a sympathy walkout for striking 
pittston coal group employees 
that brought to more than 27000 the number of miners on strike 
against coal operators in nine states not including the 1800 
picketing pittston in a contract dispute the umw has about 80000 
active members nationwide 
roberts said the telegrams were sent because the miners are 
violating a national contract signed by umw members he said the 
union must enforce that pact 
its a serious situation said jeffrey w weber a spokesman 
for amax coal cos mine in keensburg ill where 655 miners joined 
the walkout monday if you look at the big picture its very 
counterproductive to the future of these miners 
as has been the case with previous walkouts the umw gave 
companies no official reason for the wildcat strikes but most 
presumed they were related to the pittston 
roberts said monday in an interview from tazewell va that the 
union presumed the same 
its just speculation on our part as to why theyre out but 
people from the field are very upset on fines that have been 
assessed against the union for civil disobedience in the pittston 
strike roberts said 
our position has been that we have no difference with the 
umw said james strickland the director of public affairs for 
drummond coal co in jasper ala where all 1900 union miners 
walked out monday 
we have no word from the union as to what theyre up to he 
said 
virginia was taken off the wildcat list monday when 794 island 
creek coal co employees returned to work at mines in buchanan 
county they had been out since thursday 
were back in full swing said island creek spokesman noel 
jones 
despite the wildcat strikes end in virginia other industry 
officials pointed to the new walkouts and said there was no way to 
expect an end to the strike 
i think thats pretty unpredictable said steve anderson a 
spokesman for westmoreland coal co which had 850 workers out last 
week but only 100 all in west virginia on picket lines monday 
when you consider the expansion over the weekend i find it 
hard to believe that its ending 
the unauthorized walkouts began last week after a umw rally in 
charleston to protest pittstons failure to sign a nationwide 
contract and to protest fines and jail terms assessed against union 
members in virginia 
pittston wants its own contract that would include mandatory 
overtime sunday work and a cut in pension benefits the umw insists 
that the company sign the national contract which would require 
pittston to pay into the national pension fund and keep mines closed 
on sundays 
about 1600 umw employees walked off their pittston jobs in 
virginia and west virginia on april 5 after working more than 14 
months without a contract the strike spread to pittstons kentucky 
operations monday idling an additional 200 umw members 
pittston last week declared negotiations at an impasse which 
allowed it to implement its latest contract offer umw leaders are 
required by law to present that offer to their membership 
eight people were arrested monday in alexandria va after 
sympathizers of the striking miners snarled commuter traffic headed 
into the nations capital where the umw is based the protesters 
allegedly traveled two or three cars abreast at speeds of 5 mph on 
highways heading into washington from northern virginia according 
to virginia state police spokeswoman lucy caldwell 
police spotted about 100 sympathizers most of whom had signs in 
their car windows or displayed umw flags on their radio antennas 
caldwell said 
the more than 27000 miners off work monday included 16000 in 
west virginia 3900 in alabama 2500 in pennsylvania 1750 in 
indiana 1270 in kentucky 1100 in ohio 650 in illinois 338 in 
missouri and 200 in tennessee

northwest airlines parent nwa inc accepted 
a 4 billion buyout offer monday from a group led by los angeles 
investor alfred checchi capping a weekslong bidding war and taking 
further steps to keep other bidders from returning 
the checchi group which agreed to pay 121 a share for the 
parent of the nations fourthlargest airline said it planned to 
retain current management and believed it could win needed federal 
approval of the sale 
nwa announced that if its deal fell through with the checchi 
group which included klm royal dutch airlines and the australian 
conglomerate elders ixl it would undertake a recapitalization that 
would pay nwa shareholders a special 70 a share cash dividend 
analysts said such a recapitalization which would load nwa up 
with new debt and possibly place a big stock holding into friendly 
hands would make the company much less attractive to hostile 
suitors 
nwa stock soared 650 a share to 11412 on the new york stock 
exchange 
the checchi group wings holdings inc beat at least three other 
bidders rival airline pan am corp the international association 
of machinists which represents about 20000 of northwests 37000 
workers and oil billionaire marvin davis who sparked the bidding 
with a 90 a share offer on march 28 
davis who owns 29 percent of nwas common shares said in a 
statement that he supports the proposed transaction but will 
reserve final judgement until he meets with his advisers 
while disappointed by the outcome i am pleased that the nwa 
special committee has elected to sell the company as we urged all 
along davis said 
pan am issued a statement saying it was disappointed its bid was 
not chosen but that it wanted its offer to be considered if the 
checchi bid fell through and before nwa undertook its 
recapitalization plan 
the machinists union did not return repeated phone calls seeking 
comment 
checchi 41 a former marriott corp treasurer said he signed an 
agreement with the nwa board about 1 am monday in a new york city 
law office 
northwest said the checchi bid was the highest offer it received 
had the fewest contingencies and was the most likely to close 
checchi said none of his associates would join northwests 
management team and he expected nwa chairman steven rothmeier to 
keep running the company 
i talked to steve last night and we mutually congratulated each 
other checchi said monday i certainly hope he plans on 
staying i have no reason to believe he is not 
checchis proposal includes 700 million equity and 335 billion 
to be borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by bankers trust co 
checchis equity partners include klm bankers trust richard c 
blum and associates a san francisco merchant banking and investment 
firm and elders finance group a subsidiary of elders ixl 
with about 305 million common shares outstanding the tender 
offer would cost about 37 billion but checchis group already 
owns 49 percent of nwa stock the buyers also are contributing 
equity that boosts the total package to over 4 billion 
the buyout was conditioned on a majority of nwas shares being 
purchased and the deal being completed by sept 18 
checchi said he was not concerned about meeting financial fitness 
requirements of the us transportation department which must 
approve the acquisition 
the justice department is not likely to review the deal because 
it does not involve a merger of two airlines a department spokesman 
said 
federal regulations prohibit foreign carriers such as klm from 
owning more than 25 percent of a us carrier 
however klm and northwest could share gates and coordinate 
schedules for connecting flights said barbara beyer of avmark inc 
an aviation consulting firm in arlington va such an arrangement 
would not require any merger of employees or corporate staff she 
said 
checchi said his plan calls for substantial growth at 
northwest including the purchase of 138 new planes already on order 
or option by nwa 
william genoese president of the airline division of the 
international brotherhood of teamsters said he would meet with 
checchis group later this week 
they want the company to grow said genoese whose union 
represents about 7000 flight attendants and clerks at northwest 
im for anyone that comes in that will make things grow and 
improve labor relations 
nwa said its recapitalization plan would pay shareholders 70 
cash per share which would cost about 21 billion the plan might 
be financed partly with an equity contribution from a third party 
nwa said which would determine how much the company would have to 
borrow to pay for the recapitalization 
kurt rivard an analyst for dain bosworth inc of minneapolis 
said new debt the recapitalization would load on nwa could 
discourage a hostile bidder from trying to circumvent the checchi 
deal 
mondays decision capped a bidding war opened march 28 by davis 
who offered 27 billion or 90 a share 
the board rejected davis bid and his subsequent tender offer for 
the same amount it then opened a twophase bidding process that 
attracted other suitors such as pan am 
however nwas board rejected the first round of bids as 
inadequate and invited suitors to try again
