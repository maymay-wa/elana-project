a radical environmental groups founder and three 
other people were arrested wednesday on charges they conspired to 
sabotage two nuclear power plants and an energy department bomb 
factory in the west the fbi said 
two men were arrested early wednesday while trying to use a 
propane torch to cut down a utilityline pole leading from an 
electrical substation in wenden ariz fbi officials in washington 
and phoenix said 
a woman was arrested in prescott nearly 80 miles northeast of 
wenden in the alleged plot the fbi said 
a third man was arrested in tucson on charges of conspiring with 
th others to sabotage commercial nuclear power plants at 
wintersburg ariz and near san luis obispo calif as well as 
the federal governments rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near 
golden colo 
the fbi said the defendants were members of a radical 
environmentalist group calling itself the evan mecham ecoterrorist 
international conspiracy 
the organization which took its name from the former arizona 
governor who was impeached last year has sent communiques to news 
organizations in the southwest claiming responsibility for criminal 
acts the fbi said 
the fbi said the arrests resulted from a threeyear undercover 
investigation that began after vandals cut power lines at the palo 
verde nuclear generating station in wintersburg 50 miles west of 
phoenix in may 1986 
david foreman 42 who founded earth first the exclamation 
point is part of the name in 1979 was arrested in tucson on a 
charge of conspiracy he appeared before a federal magistrate there 
and was ordered held without bond 
the other three appeared in phoenix and also were ordered held 
for an appearance friday in us district court

charged with conspiracy to sabotage a nuclear facility as well as 
destruction of an energy facility destruction of property used in 
interstate commerce and destruction of government property

utility pole supporting a power line that links an electrical 
substation with two irrigation pumping stations of the central 
arizona project a multibilliondollar canal system bringing 
colorado river water to phoenix and tucson 
margaret peggy katherine millett 35 of prescott was 
arrested and charged with the same crimes the fbi said 
the fbi also investigated acts of vandalism against skilift 
equipment at a flagstaff ski resort and the cutting of powerline 
poles at three uranium mines last year in northern arizona the 
bureau said 
foreman is a cofounder of earth first said rod mondt a 
spokesman in the tucson office of the groups journal 
the loosely organized group which has no officers or formal 
membership didnt plan the attack mondt said but added 
some of us support the right to do those kinds of things 
earth first was inspired in part by the monkey wrench gang 
a novel by the late edward abbey about a trio of 
environmentalalists who try to blow up the glen canyon dam 
mondt said he was unaware of an organization called the evan 
meacham ecoterrorist international conspiracy but noted that the 
organizations acronym would be emetic a word defined as a 
medicine or other substance that causes vomiting

the government enforcing its policies to 
discourage vietnamese refugees from coming to this british colony 
on tuesday towed a boat with 109 vietnamese to a remote island 
officials reported 
they said boats carrying 745 refugees entered hong kong waters 
tuesday and a vessel with 109 people was towed to tai a chau an 
island 20 miles southwest of hong kong because other facilities 
were filled 
tai a chau has virtually no shelter 
we have had more than 2300 arrivals over the past three days 
our accomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed said 
hong kong refugee coordinator mike hanson 
he said the people taken to tai a chau would have to stay aboard 
the boat or on the dock there is one school building which some 
people may be able to use but i think most will not be able to 
have covered accomodations he added 
the refugees will remain on the island until the government can 
find a place for them and then process them hanson said he said 
he did not know how long that might take 
malaysia the philippines and hong kong received hundreds of 
thousands of indochinese boat people after communist forces 
defeated the usbacked governments in south vietnam and cambodia 
in april 1975 
but thousands of vietnamese are still fleeing their homeland 
a year ago hong kong adopted a screening policy that treats all 
indochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation 
unless they can prove they fled political persecution 
but that has not curbed the influx 
for the first five months of this year 13182 boat people have 
arrived in hong kong 
vietnam has agreed to attend an international conference on 
indochinese refugees that is to be held in geneva june 1314

a 10yearold elementary school student 
apparently feeling he needed more friends decided to buy them with 
thousands of dollars of his fathers money 
no one is exactly sure how much money the youngster spread 
around the school in his pursuit of friendship although officials 
have recovered 3000 from classmates and their parents 
he was handing out 5 10 20 and 100 bills said richard 
scruggs the school systems security officer the boy apparently 
got into his fathers stash 
the moneyforfriendship enterprise was uncovered by ritta 
school principal jw jones last week when a student asked him to 
break a 10 bill 
jones asked where the student had gotten the money and was told 
the fourthgrader was giving it away 
jones said no disciplinary action was taken against the 
spendthrift youngster officials checked to make sure no coercion 
was involved in the payments but the gifts apparently were made 
freely scruggs said 
and with some success the boy was making friends real well 
said tom shumpert assistant superintendent of the knox county

an asteroid will pass by earth just a 
little more than 8 million miles away this saturday the closest 
approach since a near miss in march but presents no danger to 
the planet astronomers say 
the asteroid estimated to be one to two miles across may be 
visible as a faint star and will grow brighter as it approaches at 
20 miles per second astronomer billy cooke said in a release 
tuesday from the university of florida 
on march 23 an asteroid came within 450000 miles of earth 
which was considered a near miss in astronomical terms 
brian marsden associate director of the harvard smithsonian 
center for astrophysics said tuesday that the asteroid due 
saturday is the sixth relatively close approach this year he 
called the number a statistical fluke 
marsden said no one should worry about this or any other known 
asteroid the one that hits probably wont be spotted until its 
too late to do anything 
its not a question of if an asteroid will hit us but when 
cooke said and it will make earthquakes volcanic eruptions and 
other natural disasters pale in comparison to its destructive 
force 
some astronomers believe an asteroid larger than a quarter mile 
across hits the earth once about every 50000 years the last 
crater formed by an asteroid occurred in arizona about 50000 years 
ago cooke said 
an asteroid that struck the earth 65 million years ago may have 
wiped out the last of the dinosaurs some scientists believe 
such a strike today would have effects similar to nuclear war 
without the radiation it would level buildings for several hundred 
miles and would create giant tidal waves cooke said 
scientists in the 1960s and 1970s thought asteroids that pass by 
earth were rare today they believe there may be hundreds and 
possibly thousands of them it is unclear if there are more 
asteroids or if astronomers have simply become better at finding 
them cooke said

a new public service announcement against 
capital punishment features an unusual cast of characters the 
homeless 
the amnesty international television commercial to be offered 
soon for international broadcasts uses 50 homeless people 
i didnt want people that were wellfed happy human beings 
to try to pull off the roles of people all over the world who have 
been imprisoned for long periods of time said commercial 
director tony bill who coproduced the sting and directed my 
bodyguard 
the homeless are disenfranchised people and they are people 
who are in effect oppressed said bill who like others donated 
work for the project 
the blackandwhite ads cast the homeless as prisoners facing 
execution their heads covered in bags before an imaginary killing 
the 30 and 60second commercials conclude with the shot of a 
falling guillotine blade 
bill said the faces of the homeless unlike those of 
professional actors naturally are filled with hopelessness and 
defeat 
i think by seeing them on the screen your attention is drawn 
to them bill said were talking about a larger issue the 
homeless people sort of represent people in prison 
bill who runs the venice restaurant selected his cast from the 
crowds of people who gather for a free meal the restaurant provides 
every tuesday those cast were paid 40 for the oneday commercial 
shooting and given lunch 
the saddest thing was to see them leave at the end of the 
shoot said producer clare baren of riverrun films it was 
horrible to think where they were going back to they were just 
really terrific people 
the commercials makers hope television stations across the 
country and around the globe will broadcast the spot it also will 
be shown at the commercial competition at cannes starting june 19

el paso texas subject el paso intelligence center 
mission collect and share with law enforcement agencies 
information on drug weapon and aliensmugglers 
number of arrests none 
our first task is tactical intelligence that which the field 
agents can use to cause an arrest or seizure says william 
norsworthy director of the center at fort bliss that publishes its 
phone number but reveals little else 
epic might tell the coast guard where to find a specific 
marijuanaladen ship off the florida coast or it might tell the 
texas department of public safety who a certain smuggler hangs 
around with 
but it looks farther downrange too 
whats going to happen two years from now in what part of the 
world we try to figure that out said norsworthy 
at epic representatives of 10 federal agencies gather evidence 
and piece together a criminological jigsaw puzzle that displays 
drug smugglers and other criminal organizations the law 
enforcement consortium doesnt make seizures or arrests and doesnt 
take credit for the arrests it produces 
they are our primary source of intelligence said jim bowen 
senior tactical coordinator for operation alliance an el 
pasobased union of federal agencies that chases and arrests drug 
smugglers along the usmexican border he declined to recount 
specific cases in which epic information resulted in largescale 
busts 
epic started out in 1974 as the southwest border intelligence 
service with 35 employees from the drug enforcement administration 
and the immigration and naturalization service working in cramped 
quarters 
four years later it had a congressional mandate a new name 106 
employees from six federal agencies and 16000 square feet of space 
in central el paso 
now the 15yearold intelligence network occupies a brandnew 
57000squarefoot building on fort bliss where 200 employees of 
the dea ins customs service coast guard marshals service fbi 
internal revenue service federal aviation administration secret 
service and bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms labor 24 hours 
a day 
some of those agencies have been known for fierce turf battles 
but norsworthy said thats rare at epic its pretty unique in 
that we all get along good after 90 to 120 days agents lose their 
agency identity and become part of epic 
epic gives operation alliance threat assessments dossiers 
on illegal organizations along with when and where they are 
expected to operate next it prepares similar assessments for the 
miamibased lightning operations center which tries to keep drug 
shipments out of southern florida 
other information goes to the agencies making up epic the lead 
law enforcement agencies in 50 states the district of columbia 
puerto rico guam the virgin islands and samoa it gets upwards of 
300000 inquiries a year 
usually when police ask for information epic asks why 
something made someone make that call either he saw or heard 
something norsworthy said we ask for that information and we 
build on that we look for patterns and trends all the time 
bits of information can be assembled like a puzzle an id number 
on the tail of a plane a series of large cash bank deposits and 
the sighting of a suspect could start an investigation ending in an 
arrest and seizure 
sometimes it turns out that different police agencies are 
investigating the same organization but arent aware of each other 
in those cases epic brings the agencies together and helps plot 
investigation strategies 
some of the information comes from those cases other times 
member federal agencies contribute some data come from fbi and dea 
offices abroad 
each agent working at epic is limited to the investigative 
methods his or her agency is permitted under us law a wiretap 
for example would require a court order 
if theres any criticism of epic among law enforcement agencies 
its that the centers computer system needs to be upgraded 
just bring them up to the state of the art bowen said 
us rep ron coleman dtexas represents the district where 
epic resides a few years ago he helped fight off a proposal to 
move it to washington now he would like to improve its computers 
my goal is to make it the absolute stateoftheart 
intelligencegathering center in the country he said 
just how advanced the computer and communications systems are is 
a secret norsworthy isnt telling but he said a police agency 
calling epic probably will find the information it wants on a 
suspect 
if hes ever been the subject of an investigation or an 
associate of someone whos been the subject of an investigation 
he said chances are pretty good

the bombardment of beirut and the blockade of 
its ports has produced an anonymous armada of small craft bringing 
in food ammunition and even whisky to the 1 million trapped 
christians here is a report on how it stays afloat 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most nights a dozen small cargo ships 
zigzag through shellfire for ports along lebanons mediterranean 
coast to deliver food and ammunition to christians besieged by 
syria and its moslem allies 
others dart in during daylight often as shells and rockets 
explode around them and knots of people stand on shore and cheer 
the ships cargoes have become the lifeline for the estimated 1 
million christians trapped in their enclave north of beirut 
this is why there are no serious shortages said a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified under standing regulations 
the ships bring in vegetables canned fruit and cattle as well as 
ammunition 
not all the provisions are essentials an east beirut 
businessman said one company recently received 11 containers of 
whisky 
the police spokesman said at least 12 ships a day make it 
through the syrian blockade they dock mainly at jounieh 12 miles 
north of beirut and the ancient port of byblos 10 miles farther 
north and at smaller harbors in between 
christian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said two 
or three ships out of every 15 carry weapons and ammunition from 
iraq syrias main arab rival and the christians only ally in the 
middle east 
the latest round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
began on march 8 when army commander gen michel aoun ordered his 
troops most of whom are christians to blockade ports run by 
moslem militias fierce artillery battles followed and the syrians 
blockaded christian ports 
despite a ceasefire called by the arab league on may 11 the 
syrians shell the christians coastal strip daily to try to prevent 
supplies from reaching aouns forces 
in recent days the syrians have deployed navy gunboats to 
tighten the blockade and some cargo ships have been turned back 
yet some christians believe the syrians are not tightening the 
noose as much as they might 
with the firepower the syrians have they could be doing a lot 
more one source said we dont know why there is this 
restraint except possibly because theyre not yet prepared to go 
all the way 
the danger zone is about six miles off the coast 
boutros sassine 23 was a crewman aboard the 1000ton lebanese 
freighter paula which took several hits on may 18 as it approached 
oqaibeh five miles north of jounieh with a cargo of food 
he and three other crewmen were wounded when a syrian 130mm 
shell hit the mast 
lying in st georges hospital in east beirut his head heavily 
bandaged boutros said the freighter was about five miles off 
oqaibeh when the shells started falling all around us 
some of them were hitting only a few feet away sending 
cascades of water over us then we were hit i saw my brother 
boulos and the others fall he said 
a fishing boat which was in the vicinity came through the 
shelling and took us ashore boutros said 
a christian source said that most of the ship captains come from 
the oqaibeh area 
their agency pays them about 5000 a trip he said the 
seamen who used to earn 200 a month now get 200 a trip which 
usually lasts between 24 and 48 hours 
the ships sail mainly between the christian enclave and cyprus 
100 miles to the northeast but christian sources reported that 
some also pick up cargoes of fruit and vegetables from the southern 
ports of sidon and tyre both run by moslem militias 
a police spokesman in sidon said merchants charter boats to take 
produce to the christian enclave 
they dont want to waste their produce he said theyre 
ready to sell to the devil 
the shiite moslem amal militia which controls tyre tried to 
stop merchants there from sending goods to east beirut 
but sources said the businessmen who pay hefty fees to amal 
told the militia they would stop only if the militia bought all 
their produce 
the traffic is not all oneway about 15000 christians have 
fled the enclave aboard ferries from cyprus the vessels anchor 
offshore and passengers must take a nervejangling ride in small 
boats in darkness and often under shellfre to reach the ferries 
hundreds more have evacuated aboard a norwegian hovercraft the 
santa maria which slips into jounieh and other ports at night

a 29year study of cancer in sweden 
shows the rate of cases increased faster among women than men 
especially skin cancer caused by too much sun 
malignant melanoma caused by overexposure to ultraviolet rays 
was increasing by 66 percent a year and ine 1987 represented 35 
percent of all cancer cases said jerzy einhorn of the karolinska 
hospital 
a law requiring doctors to report all cancer cases to a national 
registrar since 1958 has yielded a unique foundation for health 
care and planning since it covers 100 percent of the population in 
specific areas einhorn said 
the study released tuesday by the hospital covered stockholm 
and gotland a large rural island in the baltic 
sven tornqvist who was in charge of the register said the rate 
of all forms of cancer increased by 29 percent for women and 15 
percent for men in the swedish capital from 1958 to 1987 the 
figures were higher in gotland 
malignant melanoma could become the major form of cancer in 
the next century because many people who have damaged their skin 
have not yet developed the disease einhorn said 
he attributed the increase among swedes to their more frequent 
holiday trips to warmer countries and their penchant for sunbathing 
one reason for the general rising incidence of cancers is that 
people are living longer einhorn said 
lung cancer was the most common cancer but it decreased among 
men along with a decline in smoking

tourists got an afterhours look at the roman forum 
and free tours of the ancient ruins the palatine hill and the 
coliseum because of an unusal work protest by the caretakers 
the forum is normally closed on tuesday afternoon but the 
caretakers chose instead to work overtime and give away free 
tickets as a way of protesting work conditions and cultural 
ministry bureaucracy 
the workers said they want more money and they want the ministry 
to train them and offer guided tours of the forum they also want 
the ministry to hire more people and to keep the site open for more 
hours 
tourists in italy often miss the chance to see archeological 
sites and musems because of limited visiting hours and recurrent 
strikes 
the unusual protest was designed to gain public support said a 
woman employee who asked not to be identified 
if we stopped work we would just get a bad press this way we 
can show people that we are also interested in them she said

by accusing india of unfair trade 
practices the united states may have dealt a major setback to 
prime minister rajiv gandhis cautious efforts to open the vast 
indian market to foreign goods 
in a nation that has long aspired to selfsufficiency and thrown 
up a bewildering and costly barricade of red tape to foreign 
investment the few us brand names to reach consumers have 
achieved overnight popularity 
wrangler jeans cbs music cassettes and chesterfield cigarettes 
are among american goods that entered india after gandhis 
government started easing the protectionist policies of his mother 
and predecessor indira gandhi 
pepsi is poised to follow 
all are manufactured in india under license and in association 
with local partners with the foreign share limited to 40 percent 
the opening of indian markets started in 1985 a few months 
after gandhi took office but observers say last weeks citing of 
india under the us omnibus trade act could hurt the process 
the us perception seems to be that it can open up indian 
markets with a crowbar said industrialist hari shankar 
singhania from the logical point of view it is better to use 
goodwill 
maybe they got impatient i doubt whether the intended results 
will follow and maybe contrary reactions will set in he added 
in an editorial entitled a super folly the progovernment 
hindustan times said by branding india as an unfair trade 
partner at a time when the country is attempting to move towards 
more open trade the us runs the risk of reversing the tide of 
opinion building up in favor of liberalization 
a us embassy official acknowledged india had eased its trade 
restrictions but said much remains to be done 
there has definitely been some liberalization but there is a 
considerable distance to go he said speaking on condition he 
not be identified further 
washington accused india of violating the 1988 trade act by 
impeding direct foreign investment and closing its insurance market 
to foreign companies the law allows the united states to impose 
tariffs of 100 percent on goods from india if negotiations fail to 
remove the barriers within 18 months 
despite its tentative reforms india still levies customs duties 
in excess of 200 percent on some foreign goods and industrial 
components 
the government has yet to respond to the american invitation for 
negotiations its only comments have been that the us action is 
unfair and irrational 
negotiations cannot be held under threat how can you expect 
any selfrespecting country to do it said singhania who led a 
delegation to the united states earlier this month to try to ward 
off the citing of india under the omnibus trade act 
a us delegation also came to new delhi earlier this month for 
discussions with indian government officials 
we justified our restrictions because of our balance of 
payments constraints said anwarul hoda a commerce ministry 
official who took part in the talks but even while offering 
justifications we are liberalizing our trade has never been so 
liberal 
hoda and singhania noted that indias trade surplus with the 
united states has been declining from 1 billion in 1987 to 700 
million in 1988 
they said washingtons tough measures were unjustified since 
india was responsible for less than 1 percent of the united states 
overall trade deficit japan which also was cited is responsible 
for 44 percent only one other nation was singled out brazil 
both hoda and singhania acknowledged the tremendous appeal of 
us goods and services for indias 880 million people 
us brands techniques and marketing systems are the best in 
the world said singhania president of the jk organization 
which makes synthetic fabrics paints and cosmetics 
among consumer items usfranchised stereo cassettes hold a 
virtual monopoly in indias western music market 
cbs cassettes sell very well said kishore a salesman at a 
new delhi music shop who declined to give his last name since 
they came in the market music india the major local company has 
dropped 
another indicator of the appeal of american goods is the us 
embassys semiannual sale of obsolete equipment 
a weekly news magazine india today said recently that buyers 
bid feverishly for 10yearold air conditioners sometimes offering 
more than the price of a new indian model because of the strong 
mystique of the foreign brand

people at george bushs campaign 
rallies in southwestern michigan last year heard first from his 
foremost cheerleader peter secchia 
the outspoken and sometimes abrasive state republican party 
leader positioned himself at the podium for more than an hour 
before bushs arrival and led thousands of supporters in songs 
taunting democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
as michigans national committeeman since 1980 secchia never 
has been at a loss for words 
until now 
after months of tireless work on bushs behalf secchia was 
rewarded with a nomination as ambassador to italy 
it initially appeared the 52yearold italianamerican lumber 
magnate would sail through senate confirmation but secchias 
propensity for coarse humor and offcolor remarks have haunted him 
for example 
a few days after bushs selection of dan quayle to run as vice 
president secchia defended quayle amid rumors linking him 
romantically to a former female lobbyist if thats the only 
thing you can say about a 41yearold man that he danced close 
with a goodlooking woman then i think hell make one hell of a 
vice president 
secchia doesnt deny he made an offensive hand gesture to a 
political foe in the basement of a bar but after it was reported 
called it goodnatured political sparring 
a january 1988 harpers magazine article about the michigan 
gop portrayed secchia as a sexist and quoted him as making vulgar 
remarks about the size of a womans breasts secchia says he was 
misquoted 
in august 1988 secchia said of his political adversaries i 
know what sodomy is because thats what democrats are always doing 
to me 
secchia complains his comments have been misinterpreted and 
that some of the people now judging him in washington dont 
understand his humor 
theres been grumbling in italian newspapers over bushs 
selection of an ambassador who is an expert fundraiser with a 
sharp tongue but little foreign policy experience 
in the senate secchias confirmation vote was stalled until at 
least wednesday because of concerns of sen malcolm wallop rwyo 
the delay caused secchia the grandson of italian immigrants to 
miss bushs visit to italy last week 
hes certainly not pleased with reports that the senate 
wants to make him twist in the wind as punishment for socalled 
past sins said jeff davis a secchia employee fielding media 
calls secchia has declined all requests for interviews since his 
confirmation was stalled two weeks ago 
the senate foreign relations committee approved secchias 
nomination but chairman claiborne pell dri warned that 
secchia might be an embarrassment 
at home in grand rapids those who know secchia well see him 
primarily as a generous hardworking goodhearted community 
leader who just happens to put his foot in his mouth occasionally 
hes a street fighter said businessman charles yob a close 
friend and political associate when he wants something he goes 
for it 
even his political foes acknowledge secchia has been a driving

high schools are requiring students to read 
almost exactly what they did 25 years ago heavy on shakespeare but 
light on works by female and minority authors according to a 
survey 
eightyfour percent of public high schools assign students 
romeo and juliet the tearful shakespearean play that tops the 
list of required works according to the nationwide survey by the 
center for the learning amp teaching of literature at state 
university of new york at albany 
but only one of the top 10 most frequently assigned works was by 
a female author to kill a mockingbird by harper lee no 
works were by minorities according to the survey of 322 public 
schools 80 catholic schools and 86 private schools conducted last 
spring 
i think the survey shows schools are still very much concerned 
with emphasizing good literature they continue to assign classics 
complemented with modern and accessible works said the surveys 
author arthur n applebee 
at the same time its disturbing that there are essentially 
no books by minority authors working their way into the canons and 
little representation of women 
following romeo and juliet 81 percent of public high 
schools required macbeth huckleberry finn the classic 
mark twain novel was the third most assigned work with 70 percent 
requiring it 
the rest of the top 10 were in order julius caesar by 
shakespeare to kill a mockingbird the scarlet letter by 
nathaniel hawthorne of mice and men by john steinbeck 
shakespeares hamlet the great gatsby by f scott 
fitzgerald and lord of the flies by william golding 
the most frequently assigned books by minority authors are 
lorrainne hansberrys a raisin in the sun required in 19 
percent of schools and richard wrights black boy required by 
7 percent the survey found 
applebee added however that commonly used high school 
literature anthologies frequently include works by minority and 
female authors 
the survey appeared to answer conservative critics who have 
lately accused schools of watering down curricula and retreating 
from the classics such charges gained currency in the recent 
bestsellers the closing of the american mind by allan bloom 
and cultural literacy by ed hirsch 
the study also showed surprisingly that public private and 
catholic high schools are assigning nearly identical books said 
applebee 
at the 80 catholic schools surveyed the top10 list included 
the same books as public schools but in different order 
huckleberry finn ranked first followed by the scarlet 
letter and macbeth 
macbeth topped the list at 86 private schools surveyed 
unlike public and catholic schools that top10 list included 
homers epic poem the odyssey but omitted of mice and men 
the report replicated a similar survey 25 years ago by the 
educational testing service shakespeare dominated the list as he 
does now romeo and juliet replaced macbeth in first place 
apparently boosted by the popularity of the film version 
silas marner by george eliot was the only book showing a 
dramatic change in popularity the 19th century novel about an old 
miser who turns to a more human life through his love of a little 
girl ranked third 25 years ago but dropped off the top10 list in 
the latest survey 
the survey had a margin of error of 3 points

research center funded by the us department of education and the 
national endowment for the arts

in a city where pork bellies have made commodity 
traders rich it took a european chef louis szathmary to master 
the art of turning goose livers into gold 
after 26 years chef louis next month is closing his north side 
restaurant called the bakery 
i grossed more than 1300000 a year for 26 years and thats 
only five dinners a week no lunch no bar and no early birds 
szathmary said 
some restaurants give a discount for diners who arrive before 
5 pm but i never did that because my meat supplier couldnt 
guarantee quality that early 
the income estimate is even more remarkable in that the bakery 
has never seated more than 170 people at one time and all of its 
fivecourse dinners had a fixed price from 5 in 1962 to 25 this 
year 
when szathmary opened the bakery it was one of chicagos first 
restaurants outside of the downtown area to feature classic french 
cuisine resembling an unpretentious european inn it also was one 
of the first where the food got top billing over the decor 
it was also a place to sit down and listen to szathmary 
philosophize about food every night he was in town he visited 
each table talking with patrons as he doled out his fresh country 
pate 
we have every day fresh flowers and sometimes the silver 
matches but the important thing is the food on the plate he 
said 
and the food on the plate often is beef wellington it may be a 
haute cuisine cliche now but szathmary made his first hit by 
smearing beef with goose liver pate and baking it in a pastry shell 
the food writers joke about beef wellington now but they all 
raved about it once and i know 50 percent of our sales after 26 
years is still beef wellington 
other popular items at the bakery have included pork loin 
stuffed with hungarian sausage and roast duck served with cherry 
sauce 
on his retirement at age 70 szathmary is giving his 
24000volume cookbook library to the university of iowa other 
items in the collection will go to johnson amp wales university in 
providence ri 
some of my cookbooks go back to the late 1400s and they may be 
important in teaching the history of food he said 
some of his more modern works though were written by szathmary 
himself who is the author of the chefs secret cookbook 
american gastronomy the chefs new secret cookbook the 
bakery restaurant cookbook and the 15volume cookery 
americana 
a native of transylvania szathmary came to this country in 
1951 and spent 11 years in food research before becoming a 
restaurateur 
i could not do it now he said the restaurant business 
has changed too much 
one thing i am proud of though he added i never served 
one kiwi fruit

house speaker jim wright declared tuesday i 
think i know what i should do but didnt say whether that meant 
hed resign over ethics charges colleagues assumed he would quit 
and were even beginning to push 
meanwhile sources confirmed tuesday night that the fbi is 
conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of payroll 
padding on the staff of rep william gray a pennsylvania democrat 
who is seeking a house leadership post 
gray who is seeking the majority whip position in anticipation 
of the expected resignation of house speaker jim wright confirmed 
earlier in the day that he had been approached by two 
philadelphiabased fbi agents on monday 
but gray denounced as an outrageous lie a televised report 
that he was under criminal investigation 
cbs and the washington post quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the justice department was launching a preliminary criminal 
investigation of wright justice department sources have previously 
said the department was monitoring ethics proceedings against 
wright and had not decided whether to look into his financial 
dealings 
the post also quoted a source as saying wright planned to 
announce his resignation either wednesday or thursday but delay 
its effective date so the house ethics committee could rule on 
whether he accepted gifts from a business partner with a direct 
interest in legislation 
wright after returning from a weekend getaway in virginias 
blue ridge mountains told reporters i dont have a statement 
right now i expect to have one before the weeks out 
i think i know what i believe to be in my best interests and 
the interests of the institution wright told reporters as he 
returned to the capitol i want to be fair to myself my family 
my reputation and i want to be fair to this institution that ive 
served for 34 years 
while the texas democrat held his cards close fellow democrats 
were openly angling for leadership posts in what they expected to 
be a major shakeup in the house hierarchy 
a handful of senior lawmakers were pushing for the no 2 and no 
3 jobs of majority leader and majority whip that assumes as most 
in th house do that wright will soon resign and the current 
majority leader rep thomas foley of washington will be elevated 
to the speakership 
the current whip rep tony coelho of california had been 
expected to fight for the no 2 job but he said friday he would 
resign in the face of separate ethics questions about a bond 
investment he made he said a congressional investigation of that 
issue could harm the party 
gray said he had been told by fbi agents that he was neither a 
target nor a subject of a criminal investigation but government 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed a cbs news 
report that the fbi was conducting a preliminary inquiry into 
allegations regarding personnel and expenditures in the 
congressmans office 
one source said there were allegations of a noshow employee 
being kept on grays payroll the source stressed however that 
the fbis inquiry was at this point preliminary and agents did not 
know whether it would lead to a fullscale criminal investigation 
though gray denied that he was a target or subject under the 
fbis definition of a preliminary inquiry no one is a subject or 
target of such a probe 
some democrats were making clear they were running out of 
patience and one lawmaker pointedly referred to coelhos 
announcement as an example for wright to follow in deciding what to 
do about the ethics committees allegations of financial 
impropriety 
he has to take a hard look at how coelho conducted himself 
said rep jim slattery dkan calling the californians gesture 
courageous and selfless 
it is in the best interests of the institution and the 
democratic party to get this mess behind us slattery said 
regrettably that involves the resignation of the speaker 
last week sources close to wright said he had all but reached a 
decision to resign his leadership post and was leaving for the 
weekend to draft a statement defending himself that could be 
delivered along with the announcement of his resignation as early 
as wednesday but they also cautioned that wright was torn between 
such a move and fighting the ethics charges to some legal 
conclusion 
rep charles wilson dtexas said tuesday i hear that hes 
going to resign wilson who is a close ally of the speaker but 
said he had not talked to him this week added my personal 
opinion is that hell do it wednesday or thursday 
one source close to wright said he did not expect an 
announcement until at least thursday another source said the death 
tuesday of rep claude pepper dfla could cause wright to delay 
as house members would be involved with attending services for 
congress oldest member 
wright alluded to his legal fight and to a motion to dismiss the 
most serious charges against him telling reporters im 
convinced our motions are legally well grounded 
the ethics committee is due to take up the motion to dismiss 
charges at a meeting on thursday and it was seen as likely to 
reject the defense effort 
rep john t myers of indiana the senior republican on the 
ethics committee said in answer to a question that the panel also 
might expand its action to other ethics allegations against wright 
a reference to wrights investment in a gas well drilling venture 
and a deal involving a nursing home company 
its possible we could vote for a preliminary inquiry on those 
two issues myers said 
wright has been formally charged with 69 instances of violating 
house rules including charges he circumvented limits on outside 
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and charges he 
improperly accepted 145000 in gifts from a fort worth texas 
businessman with a direct interest in legislation 
should foley be promoted into wrights job rep richard 
gephardt dmo remains the favorite to succeed him although rep 
ed jenkins dga also has expressed interest in the job 
the most ferocious contest is expected for coelhos whip post 
gray reps david bonior dmich and beryl anthony dark are 
running and rep henry waxman dcalif also has been mentioned 
as a candidate 
bonior already running fullspeed said tuesday hes telling 
colleagues his middleclass constituency makes him the best 
candidate 
the suburban detroit democrat claimed 60 solid commitments of 
support slightly less than half the 130 he said he needed to win 
bonior said the demographics of his district a bluecollar 
industrial area seasoned with middlelevel managers is 
contrasted of course to the constituencies on the west coast mr 
waxman and the innercity constituency of mr gray

a special official appointed to draft an 
integration plan for louisianas higher education system 
recommended tuesday that no universities be closed or merged and 
that they be governed by a powerful unified board 
the final recommendation by paul verkuil who was appointed by a 
threejudge federal panel contained few changes compared to his 
preliminary proposal april 18 said john kennedy an attorney with 
gov buddy roemers administration 
i dont think this is a cosmetic plan kennedy said at a 
news briefing tuesday night i think you will look on the 
landscape of higher education in five years and it will not be the 
same the changes will be fundamental quality and desegregation 
the court will have the final say on the plan kennedy said he 
did not know if the judges would hear further comment from the 
parties in the case including the predominantly black southern 
university system the us justice department and grambling state 
universitys alumni association before deciding whether to 
approve it 
kennedy said roemer who had pushed for a single board with 
authority to implement desegregation plans was pleased by 
verkuils recommendation 
the single board is the linchpin of this whole thing 
kennedy said 
state sen william jefferson of new orleans an attorney for the 
southern university system said he had not seen the recommendation 
and declined to comment immediately other parties were not 
available for immediate comment 
verkuil was appointed to draw up a new plan after the court 
ruled last year that a 1981 desegregation agreement between the 
state and the justice department had failed the plan called 
primarily for spending millions of dollars to upgrade faculty 
programs and facilities at southern and grambling 
the dispute began 15 years ago when the justice department filed 
a lawsuit against the state accusing it of operating a dual system 
of higher education for blacks and whites 
under the plan recommended tuesday by verkuil president of 
william and mary college in virginia 
the single governing board would consist of 17 members 
including at least seven blacks verkuil said the board should show 
a geographic balance represent all schools and include a student 
board members would be appointed by the governor and confirmed 
by the state senate members would not have to come from existing 
boards 
black leaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to 
the needs of historically black southern university and grambling 
all current university systems would be abolished in favor of 
one system under the unified board a new president for higher 
education would be selected and an interim president would be 
appointed during the search 
louisiana state university would be the states flagship 
institution with the greatest number of graduate programs and the 
toughest admission standards currently all louisiana colleges 
have an openadmissions policy 
a second tier of schools louisiana tech southern university 
at baton rouge the university of new orleans and the university of 
southwestern louisiana would also offer graduate programs but 
fewer than lsu those schools would have less stringent admissions 
standards 
kennedy said verkuils recommendation would allow the new board 
to add other schools to the second tier 
other fouryear colleges would have still less restrictive 
admissions and limited graduate degree programs 
twoyear community colleges would offer open admissions and be 
responsible for most remedial education 
the state must continue to spend money to enhance southern and 
grambling verkuil did not recommend a dollar amount 
previous agreements between grambling and louisiana tech to end 
program duplication should be carried out while the lsu and 
southern law schools in baton rouge should agree to let students at 
one school take courses at the other verkuil said 
kennedy said verkuil recognized the states financial 
difficulties including a projected deficit of more than 700 
million for the next fiscal year and possible cuts to higher 
education

higher ticket prices strong longrunning 
musicals several acclaimed new plays helped broadway end its 
season with a record boxoffice take 
theaters took in 262 million up 4 percent over the 198889 
seasons total of 253 million according to figures released 
tuesday 
the league of american theaters and producers also said 
attendance was 8 million off slightly from last seasons record 
81 million but still higher than the 7 million of two years ago 
it was a good season it had strong boxoffice dollars and 
solid attendance said george wachtel the leagues director of 
research there were fewer musicals but there were more plays 
over the last four years it was one of the best seasons 
attendancewise 
much of the boxoffice strength came from longrunning musicals 
particularly the phantom of the opera and les miserables 
each grossing more than 500000 a week and other veteran hits 
like cats and me and my girl 
the only new musical to demonstrate much boxoffice muscle is 
jerome robbins broadway which has been running at slightly 
under capacity since it opened in january the compilation of dance 
numbers from some of the choreographers biggest hits has been 
grossing about 520000 a week 
it also has a top ticket price of 55 
the average ticket price rose from 3110 to 3390 up 6 
percent from last year the league said much of the rise wachtel 
said was because theatergoers were paying full price for tickets 
to hot shows like phantom and les miserables which are not 
available at halfprice discount 
only seven musicals including a revival of aint misbehavin 
opened on broadway during the 198889 season compared with 15 
the previous year they included such flops as legs diamond 
chu chem and welcome to the club as well as such 
stillrunning shows as black and blue and starmites 
for a variety of reasons its becoming increasingly difficult 
to mount a large musical wachtel said but i do look to the 
fact that there were two seasons fairly recently when there was as 
many as 20 musicals you have to be optimistic to be in this 
business and we are 
twentyone plays including nine revivals opened on broadway 
during the 198889 season among the biggest successes were neil 
simons farce rumors and wendy wassersteins the heidi 
chronicles which is the favorite to win the best play tony on 
june 4 
boxoffice receipts also climbed for touring productions in the 
united states and canada jumping to a record 255 million it was 
a 14 percent increase from the previous seasons 223 million

in their glovesoff campaign to end the 
prodemocracy movement authorities are tapping the painful 
memories of the chaotic cultural revolution to turn public opinion 
against the students 
but students reject any comparison of their campaign with the 
ultraleftist 196676 movement during which the nation was plunged 
into turmoil by young red guards unleashed by mao tsetung in a 
power struggle 
conservative leaders including premier li peng and senior leader 
deng xiaoping in recent days have increased pressure on students to 
stop their 6weekold protests 
the communist party newspaper the peoples daily on tuesday 
published a letter from seven unidentified intellectuals who 
chillingly warned of a new cultural revolution if the protests did 
not cease 
our middleaged generation who walked away from the cultural 
revolution purgatory still can painfully and clearly remember the 
lawlessness and turmoil of those 10 years they wrote 
the national economy was on the verge of ruin there was no 
peace in the party the country or anywhere 
we ask all comrades who in those 10 years of catastrophic 
terror lost loved ones wasted their youth and suffered hardship to 
call on their sense of responsibility to history and society the 
letter said warn your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat 
of this tragedy of history 
chinese in their 30s and older have vivid memories of communist 
chinas darkest decade when mao mobilized millions of youth to 
save his revolution from entrenched bureaucrats 
his red guards ruled the streets for two years before the army 
was called in to restore order gangs of youths tore down temples 
and churches burned books seized government ministries ransacked 
homes and persecuted intellectuals 
estimates of deaths from political turmoil during the decade are 
as high as 1 million millions more were persecuted and their lives 
destroyed 
students who have joined this springs protests are quick to 
point that their approach is different 
this years demonstrations have been peaceful students have 
gone out of their way to ensure their marches and sitins are 
orderly beijings citizens have reacted not with fear but with 
heartfelt support donating money and food to the protesting 
students 
we have been calm and orderly said a 22yearold senior 
from nanjing polytechnic college if theres turmoil you can say 
its created by the government 
the government cracked down on the protests by declaring martial 
law on may 20 but leadership divisions over how to deal with the 
students created a bitter power struggle 
the conservatives appear to have toppled moderate communist 
party leader zhao ziyang who reportedly is under house arrest a 
diplomatic source says party documents accuse zhao of helping 
incite demonstrations and of using the student movement in a bid to 
seize power 
the student protesters reject comparison to the red guards who 
were called to the streets by mao as his followers 
i think that up to now our student movement has not been 
exploited by anyone said a senior from puyang teachers academy 
in anhui province he and other students argue their movement is of 
the masses not of a government faction 
although all chinese share horrific memories of the cultural 
revolution not all share the concern that history is poised to 
repeat itself 
this time the people want democracy said a 41yearold 
mathematics professor from beijing normal university who was in 
tiananmen square to support the students a second cultural 
revolution cant come i am not afraid

a judge tuesday rejected a request 
by city officials that he prohibit a pipeline company from resuming 
operation of a fuel line that blew up in a deadly fireball last 
week 
city attorney james penman said san bernardino county superior 
court judge ben kayashimas decision had been expected 
penman attorney has unsuccessfully sought to block the calnev 
pipe line co from resuming pipeline operations or to persuade 
calnev executives to relocate the 14inch diameter fuel line away 
from city residents 
the devastating explosion fueled by unleaded gasoline being 
pumped through the line killed two people and injured dozens more 
last thursday 
a federal investigation into the cause has focused on the 
possibility that the pipe was damaged by the wreck of a southern 
pacific freight train which derailed in the same area may 12 
calnev attorney charles diamond said the federal government not 
local government has sole authority to regulate interstate 
commerce including products shipped by pipeline calnev has moved 
aggressively to establish federal jurisdiction in the case 
james j manning jr another calnev attorney told kayashima 
that the fuel company had every intention of abiding by regulations 
set by the federal office of pipeline safety the company will not 
open the pipeline without ops approval manning said 
penman complained were having a very difficult time trying 
to get calnev to comply with federal laws and to get ops to comply 
with federal laws 
but in issuing his decision the judge said the 1979 hazardous 
pipeline safety act of 1979 gives the office of pipeline safety 
authority to determine pipeline safety 
in a related development in los angeles calnev sought a us 
district court order that would effectively force the city to allow 
the company to reopen the pipeline in accordance with federal 
regulations 
over the weekend calnev obtained a similar federal order 
prohibiting city officials from interfering with the repair and 
replacement of the damaged 14inch diameter pipeline 
penman vowed to continue the fight but conceded the city faces 
an uphill battle

granted it was a lessthanelegant 
paraphrase of the solemn pronouncement of the north atlantic 
council sixteen heads of state in summit conference assembled and 
president bush summarizes a line of their communique as blah 
blah 
but no offense intended he was just skipping over words 
hurrying to get to the heavy stuff and nobody cared more about the 
heavy stuff than george bush 
it gave bush by his account a double hit he did keep 
reminding himself out loud that this was good for the alliance 
not only the united states or george bush president thereof 
after weeks of taking flak while soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev took bows for his armscontrol offensive bush had his 
own dramatic proposal in place with the blessings of the nato 
summit 
his euphoria was showing 
at a brussels news conference the president was asked why his 
arms offer didnt seek to eliminate nuclear weapons bush said 
repeatedly that the west proposes to reduce nuclear weaponry not 
go to zero 
well he said the communique addresses itself to where 
nuclear forces are concerned and stopped reading the text 
blah blah he abbreviated land sea airbased systems 
including groundbased missiles in the present circumstances as 
far as can be foreseen theyll be needed in europe 
and when will the alliance get rolling with a specific 
negotiating offer on the bush plan the president lapsed into 
natospeak 
nato is tasked to be back on september 7th with our internals 
to be farther along 
we all remember september 7th dont we he asked and 
laughed 
thats the day the campaigning bush pronounced to be pearl 
harbor day three months ahead of the real one on december 7 
he also laughed when asked whether his attitude toward the 
critics is now i told you so 
not really he said not really no listen im not going 
to get into that game with congress or anyone else 
but it wasnt the only game in town brussels or bonn 
bush was so enthusiastic he even waived his rule against talking 
to reporters at phototaking sessions briefly on tuesday well 
make an exception just to say yes im very pleased it 
was a united alliance plenty of credit for everybody there 
that was at the headquarters of the european community where 
bushs exit was briefly delayed when he tried to make his way 
through the middle of a brown curtain that had no opening in it he 
flailed briefly then went around end 
at the american school in brussels he rated the summit 
marvelous at the chancellery in bonn he said it had been good 
for the united states good for nato good for west germany and 
could be good for the soviet union too 
was the president feeling up 
have you ever seen him down said mrs bush as they flew to 
bonn 
you are a friend among friends west german chancellor 
helmut kohl told the president in welcome hed been in brussels 
too and got back shortly before the ceremony 
never mind the weeks of friction between bonn and washington 
over german demands for quick negotiations seeking cutbacks in 
shortrange nuclear missiles i told him that i dont believe 
germanamerican relations have ever been better the president 
said 
the shortrange missile compromise may yet come back to haunt 
kohl politically although he said tuesday the bush visit would be 
a boost in the 1990 west german elections 
maybe bushs upbeat mood about the nato summit was catching 
there are only winners said kohl who if he was one 
certainly didnt win much

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
disclosed a level of military spending nearly four times as high as 
the kremlin has admitted in the past but us analysts say his 
estimate is still low though likely to rise as economic reforms 
continue in moscow 
the gorbachev figure seems quite short said abraham becker 
a rand corp analyst who has published numerous studies on soviet 
military spending 
another usbased expert on the soviet economy jan vanous of 
planecon says gorbachevs figure is kind of low and raises 
more questions than it answers 
gorbachev in what was hailed in moscow as a breakthrough for 
glasnost or openness said the soviet union spends 773 
billion rubles or 118 billion per year at the rate of exchange 
set by the kremlin compared with the figure of 32 billion 
announced by soviet officials last october 
the central intelligence agency estimates soviet defense 
spending at 115 billion rubles to 125 billion rubles and says that 
roughly equals the 300 billion that the pentagon spends annually 
according to richard kaufman an expert with the joint economic 
committee of congress 
that committee annually publishes the authoritative us 
analysis of the soviet economy by the cia and the pentagons 
defense intelligence agency 
converting the ruble figure directly to dollars is virtually 
meaningless the experts said because the kremlin uses several 
rates of exchange and the armed forces have access to materials and 
devices that are simply not available to civilian enterprises 
moreover they said the ruble estimate likely will increase 
considerably when the soviets carry through longpromised changes 
in wholesale prices 
becker vanous and other experts predicted that gorbachevs 
announcement would fuel soviet discussion on military spending 
producing yet higher estimates and a lively political fight between 
reformers and conservatives 
the most important thing about the figure offered by gorbachev 
is not the number itself but the debate that it is going to start 
in the soviet union said ed hewett of the brookings institution 
in washington 
hewett compared arguments raging over the soviet spending 
deficit which was disclosed for the first time last october after 
the kremlin for years had claimed to have a balanced budget since 
last fall the figure has been revised upward by several noted 
soviet economists none of whom appear to have definitive figures 
said hewett 
gorbachev did not break down soviet military spending by 
category and his number did not appear to include research and 
development costs estimated at more than 11 billion rubles by 
vanous 
the biggest discrepancy said us analysts is that soviet 
military prices are based on artificially low production costs 
rather than the true market value of goods 
the soviets have an acute shortage of microcomputers 
vanous said by way of example it is impossible to get them in 
the civilian sector if there was a meaningful market the price 
would be quite high 
the microcomputers that go into mig fighters dont cost 
very much but there are enterprises in the civilian economy that 
would be willing to bid five or six times as much as the military 
pays for them said vanous a czechoslovakian emigre whose firm 
specializes in soviet bloc economies 
the military also consumes expensive metal alloys that simply 
are unavailable to the rest of the economy he said 
moreover there are numerous hidden military costs such as 
armaments sold to client states on favorable terms or the extensive 
civil defense system including hardening of some subway lines 
against nuclear attack which are not included in the defense 
budget said vanous 
gorbachevs number makes it clear that the government lied in 
the past said vanous it lied a lot in the past and now it 
will lie a little bit gorbachevs announcement has legitimized 
debate on this issue 
soviet reformers have been pressing the soviet defense ministry 
for more than a year to provide a more accurate accounting 
gorbachev said defense spending would be cut by 13 percent and 
the savings channeled into social services a course advocated by 
the reformers 
according to the figure provided by gorbachev the soviets spend 
about 9 percent of their gross national product on defense the cia 
estimates that the soviets spend 15 percent to 17 percent of gnp 
compared with 6 percent for the united states because the us 
economy is twice as large as that of the soviet union the 
superpowers spending is not far apart said kaufman 
the cia makes its estimates by observing soviet military 
production and activities then calculating what they should cost 
said kaufman

from socialist france traditionally 
wary of american influence in europe to conservative britain 
eagleeyed for any sign of us isolationism the europeans are 
crediting president bush with seizing back the arms control 
initiative for the west 
for bush the nato summit marked an impressive debut with 
americas often restive west european allies 
gone are the grumblings about bushs getting off to a slow 
start leaving foreign policy vaccuums and letting soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev hog the stage 
and the plaudits were a good deal more than official courtesy 
demanded 
mr bush is a very sympathetic man he looks toward 
europe he has a feeling for europe he is an understanding ally 
french president francois mitterrand told a news conference at the 
end of the twoday summit tuesday 
bush scored his biggest hit by unveiling sweeping proposals for 
big cuts in american and soviet troops strengths and conventional 
arms in europe 
the initiative presented as a challenge to gorbachev could end 
the muchfeared soviet superiority in conventional weapons 
it also was a major factor in pushing the divided europeans into 
an agreement on the future of shortrange nuclear missiles by 
tying negotiations to the implementation of an accelerated 
conventional arms agreement 
even british prime minister margaret thatcher who has said in 
the past that any cut in us troop levels in europe would send the 
wrong signal to the soviets welcomed the prospect of troop 
reductions to 275000 soldiers each 
along with the other nato leaders she said the plan had been 
the key factor in averting a deadlock over the future of 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
immediately after bush unveiled the offer in a closeddoor 
meeting of the allies mrs thatcher said the president had 
transformed the summit 
his leadership set the tone for the whole meeting said nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
with a lastminute compromise the allies agreed to superpower 
negotiations to reduce the weapons but only on strict conditions 
linked to progress on both getting and carrying out conventional 
arms cuts 
i think he has given a very clear lead said mrs thatcher 
but i never had much doubt about the quality of his leadership 
i much prefer a leader to be measured rather than dashing into 
things in the long run you get policies right 
mrs thatcher who had an exceptionally close relationship with 
former president ronald reagan appeared at the summit to strike a 
good personal note with bush 
because of the alphabetical arrangement united kingdom and 
united states the two leaders sat next to each other throughout 
the summit and usually left meetings chatting together 
british officials said they had no sense that bushs proposals 
to withdraw some american troops reflected a desire for the united 
states to loosen the costly ties that now bind it to western 
europes defense 
we saw it seizing back the arms control initiative and 
thats not to be sneezed at said a senior british official 
said spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez european unity is 
reaffirmed 
for bush it seemed at least for now things could not have 
gone better 
i was elected to do what i think is right he said i have 
been told by others here that the allies really have never had a 
meeting that is more upbeat whatever political arrows may have 
been fired my way its all been worth it

a report by an antinuclear group that 
spotlights the worstrun commercial reactors may inadvertently give 
the industry some solace 
public citizens critical mass energy project which advocates a 
phased shutdown of the nuclear industry issued a nuclear 
lemons report tuesday identifying what it called the 20 least 
safe and economic nuclear power reactors 
the report based on government and industry documents mostly 
for 1987 and 1988 activity said six of the 10 worst reactors were 
in florida tennessee and pennsylvania it said these pose a public 
health risk and should be shut down permanently 
the nuclear regulatory commission which licenses and monitors 
safety at all commercial reactors declined comment on the report 
the commission is due thursday to issue its regular semiannual 
report on the worstrun nuclear plants 
the public citizen report while identifying the industrys weak 
performers also contained information that points to some overall 
improvement in safety 
for example it reported that detroit edison cos fermi2 
reactor situated near newport mich ranked fifthworst in the 
industry based in part on the number of its emergency shutdowns 
over the past two years the plant was forced to temporarily shut 
down seven times in 1987 and five times last year 
that is a substantial improvement however over its record as 
described in public citizens 1988 nuclear lemons report that 
also rated fermi2 fifthworst overall that report said fermi2 
had 30 emergency shutdowns in 1985 and eight the following year 
also this years report said the 198788 industry average for 
emergency shutdowns was 35 compared with a 74 percent average 
for the previous two years 
public citizens figures also showed that the total amount of 
radiation to which workers were exposed at the worstperforming 
plants in 1987 was down by about 20 percent from the average 
exposure level at the worst reactors in last years report 
the economics of nuclear power however did not show a similar 
improvement 
this years report said the average operating and maintenance 
costs at the least efficient reactors averaged 72 per kilowatt of 
power generated in 1987 the latest year for which such data was 
available last years report cited a 65perkilowatt average for 
1986 
public citizen said the no 3 reactor at the turkey point 
nuclear station near florida city fla was the worst in the 
industry based mainly on a low rating for plant management and a 
relatively high incidence of forced outages or unplanned 
shutdowns 
the no 4 reactor at the same station was rated 10th worst 
carl pounds a spokesman for florida power amp light co which 
owns the turkey point reactors said the report masked a vast 
improvement in the plants performance in 1988 he said for 
example that the number of turkey point regulatory violations fell 
to 29 last year from 37 the year before 
pounds said public citizen used a grab bag list of nrc 
reports to reach its conclusions 
i would characterize it as perhaps a distorted view of nuclear 
performance that is designed to create fear and apprehension among 
the public he said 
public citizen rated each nuclear reactor on 10 different 
indicators of economy and safety 
included on public citizens list is the problemplagued rancho 
seco plant near sacramento calif the object of more nrc 
inspections over the last three years than any of the nations 
other 109 operating reactors 
sacramento residents vote next week on whether to permanently 
shut rancho seco 
the report said six reactors ranked among the worst in six of 
the 10 categories in addition to turkey point no 3 and rancho 
seco these were oyster creek no 1 of forked river nj the no 
2 and 3 units at peach bottom in pennsylvania and the fermi2 
plant near newport mich 
public citizen said four reactors scored among the worst in five 
of its categories these were sequoyah units 1 and 2 near daisy 
tenn the pilgrim no 1 reactor near plymouth mass and the 
turkey point no 4 reactor

a technique for infecting white rabbits with 
the aids virus has been developed by federal scientists providing 
researchers with a laboratory animal to test drugs and vaccines for 
combating the fatal disease 
dr thomas j kindt of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases said tuesday that because of the new technique 
laboratories everywhere will be able to use the new zealand white 
rabbit as a model for studying infections of the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
research into aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome has 
been severely handicapped because there has been no animal model to 
test treatment agents for the disease 
kindt said the rabbit now can provide that model 
if you inject this animal with human cells infected with hiv 
the infection will take in the rabbit he said within four weeks 
after the injection the rabbits immune system starts showing 
signs of reacting to the virus a finding that is called 
seroconversion 
once this has occurred kindt said the rabbit could be used to 
test drug treatments for the disease 
kindt said the rabbit could also be used to test candidate aids 
vaccines 
we could inject the rabbit with the vaccine and then after a 
period of time challenge it with the hiv cells and see if it 
reacted to the virus he said 
until now the chimpanzee has been the only nonhuman animal 
that can contract true aids and thus could be used as a model for 
studying the disease but chimps are becoming increasing rare and 
now typically cost up to 60000 each said kindt new zealand 
white rabbits cost about 40 each and a good breeding pair can 
produce up to three litters a year generally with eight rabbits 
per litter 
a very immediate and urgent need exists for thousands of 
experimental animals to test promising agents already used 
effectively in test tubes and others proposed for use against 
aids said kindt 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association has announced that 
there are at least 100 antiaids drugs vaccines and other agents 
that are stalled in development because there is no appropriate 
animal model available for testing 
kindt said that the rabbit when exposed to hiv develops some 
of the classic human symptoms of aids including enlarged lymph 
spleen and thymus glands and a decline in the numbers of healthy 
tcells one of the immune system cells 
typically he said a rabbit infected with aids can live for 
about a year unless it develops a major secondary infection which 
is common because aids destroys the immune system uninfected 
rabbits said kindt will live up to five years 
the method of giving the rabbit aids involves injecting it with 
about five million infected human cells seroconversion follows in 
about four weeks the process can be speeded up said kindt by the 
injection of about 50 million infected human cells 
kindt said that new studies need to be conducted to see if a 
rabbit infected with the aids virus can spread the disease to other 
rabbits through sexual intercourse a common way of spreading the 
disease among humans 
he said tests have shown that aids can be spread between the 
laboratory animals by injecting blood from an infected rabbit into 
another rabbit aids is often spread among human drug users who 
share needles or syringes 
kindt led a team of nih scientists that developed the technique 
to infect the laboratory rabbits others on the team are dr 
henrietta kulaga dr thomas m folks and rosamond a rutledge 
a license to commercially produce the laboratory rabbit for aids 
research has been given to rri inc a newly organized company by 
the nih kindt said the company plans to produce about 3000 
rabbits annually at a biologically secure laboratory in frederick 
md other facilities are to be built later in canada italy and 
japan to make the animal available to researchers worldwide

democratic congressional leaders who had 
fretted at the slow pace of the new administrations foreign policy 
formulation now are singing president bushs praises for his 
initiatives on arms control at the nato summit 
what had been a chorus of criticism turned into a crescendo of 
applause tuesday as bush emerged from brussels belgium with the 
nato alliance solidly behind the new us proposal on conventional 
arms cuts and united again on shortrange nuclear missile strategy 
we may be at an important turning point in history one in 
which the security environment in europe can be transformed said 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
the specter of war which has haunted that continent throughout 
the 20th century may be receding said michell who previously 
had criticized bush as slow to respond to soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs disarmament initiatives 
the president hit all the right chords with his proposals on 
conventional arms reductions in europe said rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
aspin said the agreement seems to guard against 
denuclearization of europe which was his and british prime 
minister margaret thatchers greatest fear 
aspin long a watchdog of pentagon spending added there could 
be substantial savings for us taxpayers if bush convinces the 
soviets to buy his plan for deep troop cuts in europe 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga said 
bushs proposal underscores the dangerous soviet conventional 
weapons advantages and gives nato a sound negotiating 
position 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said i applaud and very much support the 
presidents decision to move along this path 
i trust that this proposal will be approved by our nato allies 
and by the soviets said pell 
sen carl levin dmich said gorbachev and bush now have 
created a onceinacentury opportunity to transform the 
eastwest security relationship 
with his latest proposals the president has shown that he is 
convinced that gorbachev is ready to change the military balance in 
europe and that he is willing to commit the us to be an active 
partner in this process levin said 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the foreign 
relations subcommittee on european affairs said bush put a very 
substantive conventional arms proposal on the table along with 
a politically necessary nuclear proposal 
he has demonstrated an understanding of the dynamic at work in 
nato in terms of responding to gorbachev biden said 
moreover the president has silenced at least for the moment 
those who criticized his allegedly dilatory start in coming to 
grips with the challenge poised by the gorbachev inititives biden 
said 
the time had nearly run out and i think he took it right up to 
the wire biden said but i think its sort of a vindication 
for him

the military seems to be proving every cloud 
has a silver lining even when the cloud is created by a destroyed 
missile 
the air force on tuesday offered a good news story although 
it looked like some stretching the military frequently criticizes 
the press for reporting only bad news stories ignoring all the 
good things that happen inside todays armed forces 
recall first that on may 11 the air force conducted the first 
test flight of the new midgetman longrange nuclear missile the 
missile had to be destroyed by a range safety officer when it went 
out of control apparently because of a secondstage rocket nozzle 
malfunction 
tuesday the air force issued a press release that began the 
air force announced today the first flight of the midgetman 
achieved almost 85 percent of its mission objectives instead of 
the previously announced 50 percent 
it seems that staying up in the air is only 15 percent of the 
objective

a sailor named as beneficiary of a 
lifeinsurance policy of a buddy who died in the explosion aboard 
the uss iowa says many of the crew working in the gun turret where 
the blast occurred lacked experience and had never worked together 
gunners mate 3rd class kendall l truitt told reporters tuesday 
the crew was hastily assembled before the april 19 exercise and gun 
turret no 2 was undermanned by as many as 30 positions 
the gun crew never worked together this was to be their first 
shoot truitt said 
truitt said a number of experienced crew members did not report 
for duty and were replaced with less experienced sailors 
some of the people that were missing had relatively key places 
and possibly inexperienced people had to be put in their jobs to 
fill them truitt told a news conference 
truitt said his friend clayton hartwig the crew head killed in 
the blast was assigned to participate in the exercise at the last 
minute 
fred p moosally the iowas captain has said his best gun crew 
manned the no 2 turret the navy has also said such crews are not 
always fully staffed during peacetime exercises 
truitt and his attorney ellis rubin of miami suggested the 
explosion that killed 47 sailors may have occurred when an 
inexperienced sailor pushed bags of gun powder too quickly into the 
magazine of the gun 
pushing the bags too quickly against the projectile could cause 
friction and heat that could spark an explosion rubin said truitt 
said the sailor assigned that job was barely qualified for the 
position 
i want the navy to tell us he was qualified and was tested 
and instructed in this delicate job rubin said he declined to 
release the name of the deceased sailor 
rubin said truitt told navy officials he believed the explosion 
was sparked by a too rapid a loading of the powder bags 
the attorney also suggested that the gunpowder in the bags was 
volatile because it had been improperly subjected to high 
temperatures during storage 
the navy has acknowledged the powder was not properly stored but 
said chemical tests indicated faulty storage had not made it more 
explosive 
rubin demanded an apology from the navy for news leaks he said 
falsely linked his client to a murdersuicide plot with hartwig 
we are asking from an identified spokesman in the navy that 
they clear this gunner mates name rubin said 
according to published reports the navy has investigated the 
relationship between truitt and hartwig who named his friend as 
sole beneficiary in a 50000 doubleindemnity lifeinsurance 
policy 
the navy however issued a statement saying that it has made no 
official finding regarding possible culpability nor made any 
allegations concerning any individual as it relates to the 
explosion which occurred aboard the uss iowa on april 19 and 
considers actions of that nature to be premature speculative and 
not in the best interests of the naval service or any of the people 
or families involved 
the navy said it would release findings of its investigation 
when it was completed

had been a upi reporter for nearly 18 years much of it as the 
services chief investigative reporter 
we asked to see the manuscript not to censor it said al

he refused to assure upi that the book he is writing about upi is 
beneficial to the company and that it was not a conflict of

gordon said the news services managment knew he and cohen were 
writing the book for which 200 people mostly present and former 
employees of upi were interviewed 
i told him the book was written by two people who had a 
combined 43 years with upi and we were very sympathetic to the 
institution gordon said he said they needed to see the 
manuscript i told jim arnold senior vice president of upi that i 
was shocked that a wire service that for years fought for the first 
amendment would follow such a course

a model of the multimilliondollar monument 
designed to symbolize los angeles was ridiculed when it was 
unveiled six months ago but it got a warmer reception up north 
the steel cloud model has been on display in san francisco 
i really hope it gets built said san francisco architect 
michael harris 
the model is a replica of the 33 million project backers hope 
will span over the hollywood freeway as los angeles answer to the 
statue of liberty 
the conglomeration of structures would house museums gigantic 
aquariums theaters and eateries it would be propped up on a grid 
of exposed steel beams 
some critics of the project say it looks like the ruins left by 
an earthquake but supporters say the design is gaining acclaim 
to me it symbolizes the openness of la said architect 
mark horton a director of the art amp architecture exhibition space 
where the model is on display 
weve been moving very fast said nick patsaouras chairman 
of the privately funded west coast gateway committee which is 
trying to get the project literally off the ground 
people have begun to take the work more seriously said

with springtimes tardy entrance to 
northern new england the dreaded black flies have started buzzing 
by and folks who stay outdoors are hunting for ways to avoid the 
blooddrawing bites 
they kind of tend to drive you foolish says james f dill 
a university of maine extension specialist in pest management 
they come in swarms and have a tendency to swarm around your 
head they seem to like to bite where clothing fits tightly like 
if youve got a sleeve they like to burrow in and bite there 
of course theyll bite everywhere dill said 
blackfly experts and victims in maine say their state may 
suffer more of the pests than any other in the region although new 
hampshire state entomologist ziegfried thewke said the flies can be 
a nuisance throughout all northern states and even in the midwest 
and parts of the west 
thewke said there is no way to tell how many black flies will 
infest an area in a given year other experts say years of low 
moisture may have fewer flies although they will always be present 
the flies are at their worst in wooded areas with lots of clean 
running water and they are faster than mosquitoes when it comes to 
biting 
a black fly will come whizzing along and land and attack 
quickly thewke said adding that a few types of black flies give 
the whole group a bad name 
there are 30 some species of black flies here in new 
hampshire but only four of them bite humans he said 
the first few tend to come out in early may and the swarm can 
be in full swing toward the end of the month sometimes hanging 
around as late as november 
sometimes we just have to wear bug nets head nets gloves 
longsleeve shirts and insect repellent naturally said john r 
moring an associate professor of zoology at the university of 
maine if youre new in maine or a baby sometimes you get a 
worse reaction 
the insect repellent called fly dope in maine can have its 
bad side effects however for example some types melt plastic 
if you have plastic lenses on your glasses you can find your 
fingerprints on them and you can find your hands sticking to the 
steering wheel moring said 
people fight the flies in many other ways with varying degrees 
of success 
i dont condone this but a lot of people will smoke big 
cigars moring said the smoke keeps them away 
others use b vitamins or yeast tablets believed by some to make 
the body odor unattractive to the flies 
at the sugarloaf usa resort in western maine officials have 
taken a more aggressive approach 
they brought in hungry bats and built small bat houses near the 
golf course 
we call them bat condominiums said sugarbush spokesman 
chip carey we put the bats in last year they ate a lot

the body of rep claude pepper will lie in 
state in the capitol rotunda as a tribute to a halfcentury 
political career in which he championed the elderly and the poor 
his former colleagues promise 
peppers political odyssey one of the longest in american 
history ended tuesday with his death at age 88 a florida democrat 
who served as a state representative before his election to the 
us senate in 1936 pepper later served in the house after 12 
years out of office and became its oldest member 
he was always a voice for the voiceless and a helping hand for 
the helpless said house speaker jim wright dtexas wright said 
the house will adopt a resolution today so that pepper can lie in 
state thursday 
the senate was also expected to approve the resolution today 
wright said lying in state in the rotunda is the highest final 
honor an american can receive it has been accorded presidents and 
more recently to the unknown soldier from the vietnam war 
pepper had been hospitalized since april 6 suffering from an 
undisclosed stomach ailment which a spokesman in his office said 
tuesday was cancer he died at walter reed army medical center 
where he returned a month ago after an interim stay at johns 
hopkins hospital in baltimore 
peppers colleagues said he used his opportunities to the hilt 
and to the service of his least powerful constituents 
in the bosom of that small gentle man beat the heart of a 
giant a heart that felt the pain of a world where children go to 
sleep hungry and where the old die alone rep joe moakley 
dmass said 
he was not just a witness to the century he helped shape the 
century said rep david e bonior dmich the chief deputy 
whip of the house 
pepper born sept 8 1900 on a farm near dudleyville ala 
rose from poverty to attend the university of alabama and harvard 
law school in congress he was an architect of some of the 
nations most enduring safety net programs including social 
security the minimum wage and medical assistance for the elderly 
and for handicapped children 
he was the first national legislator to push publicly for 
federal funding for the war against cancer a disease that took his 
wife mildred in 1979 some 43 years after they were married they 
had no children 
in his final years he dug in his heels against cutting social 
security benefits to elderly retired workers half a century after 
campaigning for establishment of the retirement program 
president bush who presented pepper with the medal of freedom 
the nations highest civilian award during a hospital visit last 
thursday offered this summing up from bonn west germany 
claude pepper gave definition and meaning to the concept of 
public service he fought for the poor and the elderly in his own 
determined way 
those who agreed with him were proud to follow his banner 
those who disagreed with him always respected him claude pepper 
was a gentleman a noble human being 
others noted peppers extraordinary length of public service 
beginning with his election to the florida house of representatives 
in 1928 at age 28 
he went to the senate four years into the administration of 
president franklin d roosevelt defeated for reelection in 1950 
he taught and practiced law until his election in 1962 to the house 
from a miami district 
pepper who early on perceived the threat posed by adolf hitler 
earned winston churchills undying affection for casting the only 
vote in the senate for the lendlease act the first time around 
but his senate career ended in 1950 after a campaign which saw 
him branded as red pepper playing on claims during the 
communist scare of the era that he was soft on the soviet union 
bonior a member of the rules committee that pepper had chaired 
since 1983 said the ailing congressman obviously was wracked 
with pain but was able to bring himself together during bushs 
presentation of the medal of freedom 
he said pepper spoke for 10 minutes on how public service had 
been the passion of his life 
moakley who also was with pepper when bush presented the medal 
said the congressman had summoned his staff to his hospital bed to 
brief him on pending legislation and casework immediately after the 
ceremony 
claude was a fighter and he died fighting moakley said 
rep edward r roybal dcalif chairman of the house select 
committee on aging which pepper once headed said pepper will be 
remembered as one of the countrys most beloved and renowned 
defenders and champions of millions of elderly americans

gear just shattered into a million pieces and dropped down into the 
gorge it all happened in seconds

feet to the ground before the helicopter landed safely on the 10th

five months

would still be seeking the majority whip position being vacated by 
rep tony coelho dcalif i have done nothing wrong gray said

about nature of the fbi investigation and that they had concocted 
a number of theories including one that gray might have been 
contacted in connection with an already existing probe on capitol 
hill not a new one

plebani said we dont know what to expect to happen next 
after the news conference gray and his aides met in his office

america hates a loser and no politician seems 
more scorned these days than michael dukakis 
the failed democratic presidential candidate is the butt of 
jokes in his home state question what does dukakis mean in 
greek answer mondale 
the massachusetts governor also is facing a huge state budget 
deficit a cranky legislature a wife recovering from alcoholism 
and the lowest popularity ratings of his career 
when his car was stopped for an expired registration sticker 
recently his driver was given a warning instead of the usual 50 
fine a radio station sold cardboard cutouts of dukakis saying 
ordinary people could avoid tickets too if only they had a 
governor in the back seat 
now a california company has started an advertisement showing a 
photo of dukakis giving a speech there are some people even we 
couldnt make more persuasive reads the huge caption 
fortune magazine declined to run the ad by precision 
technologies inc but the twopage spread appears in the latest 
california editions of newsweek and inc magazines 
the creators insist the ad isnt meant to demean dukakis 
in fact the two people who came up with the idea supported him 
in his bid for the white house and one even campaigned for him 
said ken mandelbaum of the mandelbaum mooney ashley advertising 
agency in san francisco 
but lest the ad be overlooked the yearold agency that has also 
made controversial ads showing nudists and underwear sent a copy of 
its dukakis piece to news organizations 
a spokesman for the governor said the unauthorized use of 
dukakis photograph to sell a product shows a lack of common 
sense and decency 
the ad pushes a product that can make a photographic slide from 
the image on the screen of a personal computer 
its something that will allow anyone to make more persuasive 
presentations the text reads 
we were sitting around talking about who was a poor presenter 
who couldnt get his points across and dukakis was the guy who 
leapt into mind mandelbaum said 
the only other candidate considered was neville chamberlain the 
british prime minister remembered for his appeasement of adolf 
hitler but they decided few people would recognize chamberlain 
mandelbaum said 
dukakis was in toronto on tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment but donald k stern the governors chief legal counsel 
said massachusetts law prohibits use of a persons photograph for 
advertising or commercial purposes without their consent 
that law reflects common sense and decency stern said 
one would hope that any company would show restraint in using 
someones likeness for commercial purposes and that any magazine 
would take steps to determine whether consent has been given before 
they ran it 
mandelbaum said there had been some debate about the legality of 
using the photograph 
i think the company looked at the risks and accepted them 
he said 
fortune spokesman gary belis said the magazine would not discuss 
its reasons for rejecting the ad 
hank thunhorst national advertising manager for inc said he 
didnt think the ad was derogatory just trying to make a point 
in the past advertisers have used pictures of presidents that 
were derogatory thunhorst said they flayed nixon pretty 
good 
cambridge pollster gerry chervinsky called the ad demeaning 
that after all was the knock on dukakis that he was a poor 
campaigner who couldnt get the message across he said 
chervinskys polls of massachusetts voters last month show that 
53 percent have an unfavorable view of dukakis and 41 percent have 
a favorable view a national survey in early april showed 39 
percent rated dukakis unfavorable and 44 percent favorable he said 
in massachusetts theres a tremendous amount of dukebashing 
going on he said nationally there was some lessening of 
derision because its basically out of sight out of mind 
chervinsky said the public is used to having political figures 
lampooned 
its sort of a sad commentary chervinsky said if its ok 
to bash dan quayle the incumbent vice president nightly as he is 
bashed then i guess its ok to bash the loser 
but to me its like leave the poor guy alone already

the opposition says the regime of 
gen manuel antonio noreiga is holding at least 89 political 
prisoners 
the prisoners are nothing more than hostages opposition 
presidential candidate guillermo endara said in an interview 
tuesday 
the panamanian defense forces commanded by noriega take people 
prisoner for a while and then if things are quiet they just let 
them go he said they take people off the street people who 
were just watching a parade 
the opposition charges were the latest following the may 7 
presidential election which the government nullified three days 
later international observers said the opposition led by endara 
won the election by a 31 margin 
the organization of american states has criticized noriega the 
vote nullification and the beating of endara and two other 
opposition candidates 
opposition first vice presidential candidate ricardo arias 
calderon said six people arrested may 24 while marching with 
opposition candidates to an oas delegation meeting have not even 
been allowed to see their families 
at a news conference arias calderon distributed a list of 89 
people he said were political prisoners it included opposition 
spokesman luis martins legislative candidate felipe escobar 
antonio galvez arias calderons bodyguard and jose guillermo 
lutrel a panamanian human rights committee election observer 
many prisoners were accused of threatening state security and 
sentenced to a year in jail the night of their arrest arias 
calderon said 
he said such sentences often are converted into fines payable at 
the rate of 1 a day but inmates relatives were told nobody is 
available to collect fines 
messages left for a defense forces spokesman for comment on 
arias calderons charges were not returned the defense forces have 
not commented on the issue despite repeated requests

transplant doctors predict pigs will become a 
main source of donor organs for people once the many technical 
problems of crossspecies transplantation are resolved 
while primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better 
match pigs are cheaper more plentiful and easier to breed says 
dr hugh auchincloss jr assistant professor of surgery at harvard 
university 
what could change i suppose is that we could become better 
at making artificial organs than we are now then we wouldnt need 
the animal organs but i dont see that as coming first 
auchincloss said tuesday at the annual meeting of the american 
society of transplant physicians 
only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for 
all types of research according to auchincloss 
it doesnt make any sense to use chimpanzees because youre 
going to make such a small impact in the wellbeing of humans and 
youll make people so mad because it is where they focus from the 
point of view of animal rights understandably so he said 
if you can eat the pig im not sure you cant transplant the 
liver said arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical 
ethics at the university of minnesota 
but some animalrights activists say theyre opposed to using 
animals whether its chimpanzees pigs or even rodents 
animals arent here to be our spare parts said dr neal 
barnard a psychiatrist who serves as president of the physicians 
committee for responsible medicine in washington 
theyre putting all their energy into this hightech 
incredibly expensive use of the limited resources we have to put 
into health care and it has maybe a onein10 million chance of 
ever working out said susan stewart head of the research 
investigative committee for the last chance for animals in los 
angeles 
about 30 animaltohuman organ transplants have been performed 
worldwide most of them in the early 1960s according to 
auchincloss 
the longest survivor was a 27yearold woman who lived nine 
months with a chimpanzees kidney she received in 1964 the latest 
patient a 12dayold girl known as baby fae died 20 days after 
receiving a baboons heart in 1984 at californias loma linda 
university medical center 
if you define success as oneyear survival we still havent 
gotten one auchincloss said but weve come awfully close 
about 50 cases also are known in which doctors attached pigs 
livers to coma patients on a temporary basis mostly in the 1960s 
auchincloss said the patients blood was passed through the pigs 
livers but it was not clear whether the animal organs actually 
performed the same function as the patients own intact livers 
such drastic measures are necessary because of the critical 
shortage of donated organs according to dr keith reemtsma 
chairman of surgery at columbia university he performed the 
recordsetting transplant in 1964 that involved the chimpanzee 
kidney 
as of tuesday there were 14993 people in the united states 
waiting for kidney transplants 1252 for hearts 767 for livers 
229 for heartlungs 257 for pancreases and 80 for lungs according 
to the united network for organ sharing 
even if we retrieved every human heart that is available 
there still would be a shortage of donor organs reemtsma said 
research on crossspecies transplants called xenografts is 
under way at about a dozen us institutions many of the animals 
have survived several months and a few could have gone on 
indefinitely auchincloss said 
researchers at east carolina university in greenville nc 
have found the potent antirejection drug cyclosporine commonly 
used by human transplant patients does not work well in 
crossspecies transplants involving rodents they report greater 
success with rabbit antibodies that target the cells attacking 
foreign tissue 
such experiments must move from rodents to primates before the 
procedure can be tested on people perhaps during the next decade 
auchincloss said experts know they face tough decisions when that 
happens 
who do you do them on until the techniques are refined 
children or adults caplan asked who goes first and how do you 
get informed consent what do you say

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange bounced 
back wednesday while the us dollar edged down against the 
japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 8394point 
loser the previous day regained 18986 points or 056 percent to 
end trading at 3426675 points 
the dollar finished at 14270 yen down 040 yen from tuesdays 
close of 14310 yen the currency moved between 14243 yen and 
14290 yen 
traders said the dollar eased as market players sold it to buy 
european currencies due to speculation that britain might raise its 
discount rate following a similar move by japan 
the bank of japan announced tuesday that it will raise its 
official discount rate by 075 percentage point to 325 percent 
effective wednesday reversing its easy money policy for the first 
time in nine years 
the discount rate hike in japan has little impact on foreign 
exchange dealings because it has been expected for over a month 
said a trader with a major commercial bank 
speculative investors demands for the us currency remained 
strong he said 
analysts say president bushs pledge for a 20 percent cut in 
us military forces stationed in europe boosted the dollar because 
people expected the move would help reduce the us budget deficit 
on the stock exchange dealers said the indexs recovery was 
spurred by the yens rebound on the currency exchange 
but trading was directionless said an analyst with nomura 
securities speaking on condition of anonymity 
the energy of the market has been low due to uncertainties 
over the political situation and in the currency market resulting 
in thin directionless trading recently he said 
the strong yen has long been a merit in stock trading but now 
its stability should be considered more than its level the 
analyst added 
some participants remained on the sidelines due to concerns over 
a west german federal bank meeting thursday where market players 
speculate the west german interest rate might be raised again he 
said

a yale graduate charged with four 
murders was a brilliant student and a star athlete but was 
frustrated entering the working world by a lingering poorly 
understood illness neighbors and friends said 
a judge on tuesday set a 4 million bail for rolando marcello 
who was formally charged with four counts of firstdegree murder 
for a memorial day rampage that left his mother brother a family 
friend and a neighbor dead 
what would make a young boy a promising kid just snap like 
this asked superior court judge mariam span we dont know 
that fatal moment he just lost all control this was not a 
malicious boy 
span did not order a psychiatric evaluation 
marcello who was being held in the union county jail was 
carried manacled and dressed in jail khakis into the court 
police said they found no indication of drug or alcohol use in a 
search of marcellos house they recovered what they said was the 
murder weapon a 10inch butcher knife 
as a straighta student at oratory preparatory school where he 
graduated in 1983 marcello was named union county scholarathlete 
of the year served as editor of the school newspaper was captain 
of the chess team and president of the national honor society 
he was everything you wanted to see in a young man said the 
rev floyd rotunno oratorys headmaster he was academically 
gifted but he was really wellrounded in everything i never even 
saw him angry 
steve galluzzo and ted sanders who live in the treelined 
uppermiddle class springbrook park neighborhood with marcello 
said that anita marcello told them six months ago that her 
23yearold son was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome which 
also has been called epsteinbarr syndrome 
the syndrome has the nickname yuppie flu because it tends to 
strike highachieving harddriving people in their 30s but dr 
thomas lane director of the university of connecticut fatigue 
clinic called the label purely a media misnomer 
he said the us centers for disease control has cited the 
syndrome as a new illness that can also occur in the poor and 
elderly 
i have difficulty connecting chronic fatigue syndrome as it 
is now defined to homicide said lane but he said the syndrome 
can cause depression 
suicide is certainly common he said 
the symptoms include longterm fatigue possibly caused by the 
epsteinbarr virus which causes a form of mononucleosis some 
medical researchers are looking into mental illness as a cause for 
the syndrome 
his mother talked about this syndrome thing because people 
were asking about rolly when was he going back to work and all 
that sanders said it didnt seem like anything was wrong with 
him he was just a normal kid and a brain he just went ape 
thats all 
the other victims were marcellos 20yearold brother raymond 
family friend nelson paiva 20 and neighbor mark dennis 36 
neighbor richard hartmann was in stable condition tuesday with stab 
wounds to the chest 
after graduating from yale in 1987 marcello worked a short time 
as an intern with chemical bank in new york before mononucleosis 
forced him to drop out in february 1988 neighbors said

the nations first lawsuit filed under a 
new federal law that bars housing discrimination against families 
with children has been settled outofcourt for 25000 
a federal court on tuesday approved the settlement between the 
justice department and lafonge associates an apartment management 
company 
the department charged that lafonge had refused to rent a 
onebedroom apartment to a single mother and her child 
the case against lafonge owner of somerset mews garden 
apartments in franklin township was the first under amendments to 
the federal fair housing act 
the amendments passed last year prohibit housing discrimination 
against people with handicaps and those with children retirement 
communities with special facilities for elderly people are exempt 
lafonge officials denied any wrongdoing 
the owners do not want prolonged litigation to obscure their 
longstanding commitment to providing decent housing for all 
persons the company said 
rather than devote substantial resources to litigation 
involving a single isolated incident it is far more appropriate to 
resolve this issue in a way which truly serves the goal of fair 
housing 
the 25000 award will go to the housing coalition of middlesex 
county which brought the complaint to the justice department on 
behalf of the woman

communist leaders have agreed that imre 
nagy leader of the 1956 antisoviet uprising was illegally 
executed two years later after being convicted of 
counterrevolution a party spokesman said 
after tuesdays announcement however communist party chief 
karoly grosz said that while he did not oppose nagys legal 
rehabilitation he was opposed to blaming the party for the 
premiers execution 
nagy had called for open multiparty elections before the 
shortlived revolt was crushed by soviet tanks 
reformers within the ruling communist party have backed calls 
for nagys rehabilitation as the country moves toward a multiparty 
political system 
also during its meeting monday the partys policysetting 
central committee decided to move up to the fall a party congress 
that had been scheduled for 1990 
the committee agreed that there is every indication that 
nagy was executed in the wake of a show trial and that his 
sentence was a violation of the law party spokesman laszlo major 
told reporters 
in a later television interview grosz claimed no part of the 
ruling communist party had taken a position on nagys guilt or 
innocence 
those returning the verdict were obviously influenced by other 
forces he did not identify the sentence was not a party 
decision 
major said there had been considerable debate during 
mondays session on nagy and the central committee agreed it 
cannot come to a final decision because documents are still 
missing and a judicial review is still in progress 
major told reporters several central committee members 
pointed out that nagy died a committed communist 
the partys admission came as no surprise in the wake of a 
public debate over nagys 1958 execution and burial in an unmarked 
grave on june 16 the remains of nagy and some of his associates 
are to be reburied 
major said the party would like the day to be one of national 
reconciliation but said it plan to be represented at the reburial 
since it was not invited the event is to be televised to the 
nation 
laszlo domonkos a deputy department head of the central 
committee said tuesday that the date of hungarys first multiparty 
elections promised by communist authorities depends on talks 
with opposition groups 
the talks have been delayed by disagreements over the makeup of 
negotiating teams and the agenda 
also tuesday two central committee members stepped down the 
party said in a communique the two mihaly korom and sandor 
rajnai the current ambassador to moscow were both involved in the 
nagy case as interior ministry officials say relatives of nagy and 
other victims of the postrevolt crackdown

the state he represented in washington for half a century as a 
tireless advocate for the elderly and poor a powerful orator and a 
charming humble man 
he was a particularly talented and able man who didnt have 
any selfishness in him said rep charles bennett 78 a democrat 
and now dean of the states congressional delegation he was just 
interested in what he could do for mankind 
the body of the 88yearold congressman who died tuesday will 
lie in state in the us capitol rotunda on thursday a measure of 
respect typically reserved for national heroes he will be buried 
in tallahassee next to his wife mildred who died of cancer in 
1979 
tributes came from admirers and political foes from all over 
florida which pepper watched grow from mostly rural land into the 
nations fourth mostpopulous state and home to many of the senior 
citizens whose cause he championed 
the sense of loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory 
of a lifetime full of achievements on behalf of all people said 
gov bob martinez 
he always said it was the senior citizens who made this 
country great said leila johnson a 74yearold resident of 
mildred and claude pepper towers a federally subsidized 
seniorcitizen apartment complex in miami where the flag flew at 
half staff 
mrs johnson remembered pepper telling her that after working to 
raise and educate their children senior citizens are still 
contributing to society 
in my life he made me think that maybe i did make a 
contribution she said 
pepper served in the senate from 1936 to 1950 when he lost a 
reelection bid after being branded red pepper and charged with 
being soft on the soviet union he taught and practised law until 
winning election to the house in 1962 
sen bob graham praised his fellow florida democrat as a 
champion for justice for civil rights for a prepared america to 
defeat nazi tyranny and for dignity for older americans 
america will miss this champion but we will honor his memory 
by renewing our dedication to his ideals of justice and human 
dignity 
republican sen connie mack recalled that pepper once served 
with his maternal grandfather morris sheppard who represented 
texas in the senate for 42 years he said pepper would be missed 
by americans everywhere whose lives are now better because of his 
dedication and leadership 
senator pepper was as old as this century yet he was perhaps 
the first of our modern leaders for the new florida said florida 
house speaker tom gustafson 
when you consider he was a man who knew orville wright and 
welcomed the astronauts back from the moon you have an 
understanding of the span of history he represented said 
democratic state sen jack gordon of miami beach peppers friend 
for 30 years 
despite his age pepper never lost his oratorial skills that 
made him famous on the house floor 
he could spellbind an audience said hal wilkins vice 
president of development for florida state university in 
tallahassee which has the mildred and claude pepper library and 
custody of the congressmans papers he could walk into a room 
filled with people and the whole room would light up 
polly sermon a pepper towers resident said she had known 
pepper since 1932 and wouldnt be living in the housing complex if 
it werent for him 
he was strictly for the senior citizens the rock of 
gibraltar ms sermon said if he promised you anything you 
got it he was here for us 
pepper represented the 18th congressional district which covers 
most of miami and all of miami beach bal harbour and key biscayne 
its center is miamis heavily cuban eighth street or calle ocho 
and 50 percent of the district is hispanic

the bush administration wants congress to 
support a covert supply of weapons to noncommunist guerrillas 
fighting cambodias vietnambacked government the new york times 
reported today 
the aid would be used to strengthen prince norodom sihanouks 
position in negotiations with the phnom penh government and with 
the communist khmer rouge forces the newspaper attributed the 
report to unidentified bush administration officials 
earlier this month the prince indicated he might be able to 
reach an accommodation with the phnom penh government under certain 
conditions 
the times quoted a state department official as saying we 
believe that appropriate assistance will strengthen the political 
standing and security of the noncommunist resistance and enhance 
its position in negotiations for a political settlement of the 
war in cambodia 
the official said such aid would help the noncommunist force 
hold its own if the khmer rouge tried to seize control 
sen claiborne pell dri said he had not been notified of 
any new administration initiative on cambodia 
their policy always was that they wanted to give lethal aid to 
the sihanouk forces the senate foreign relations committee 
chairman said in a telephone interview tuesday night with the 
associated press 
pell said such aid was included in an administration bill but 
he was not sure of its status and added that the administration has 
not pushed for the aid 
pell was among three senators who wrote bush last weekend 
opposing lethal aid to sihanouks forces on grounds it may fall 
into the hands of the khmer rouge 
my view is that would be a major error unless there is 
specific language that it not go to the khmer rouge pell said 
when asked what his reaction would be to such a proposal from the 
administration 
the khmer rouge led by pol pot ruled the southeast asian 
country from 1975 through 1978 and presided over the period in 
which 1 million cambodians died 
a state department official who refused to be identified would 
not be specific when asked whether the administration would seek 
congressional backing for lethal aid to the noncommunist forces 
its our policy to do what we can do to strengthen the 
noncommunist resistance the official told the ap we believe 
that by doing so they will be better able to play the essential 
political role which will be required if there is to be a 
comprehensive political settlement in cambodia and such a 
settlement is the best way of controlling the khmer rouge

a federal appeals court has ruled that a 
5yearold black child should remain with his white foster parents 
ending a threeyear custody fight with the boys black former 
guardians 
the rev willie williams who had custody of raymond bullard 
between 1985 and 1988 said he and his wife elaine will not 
appeal tuesdays decision by the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
our family has suffered greatly williams said i dont 
want to keep dragging it on and on and on 
williams said he has declined to see the child during the appeal 
for fear of confusing him and would continue that to help the 
youngster adjust to the home of john and marilyn mclaughlin the 
boy turns 6 on june 25 
michael churchill the mclaughlins attorney said his clients 
are hopeful that a long nightmare is over 
im very happy said mrs mclaughlin hopefully its 
over 
when he was a few months old in october 1983 raymond was placed 
with the mclaughlins for what was supposed to be six months but 
his mother who had emotional problems was deemed not ready to 
resume caring for the child at the end of the period and raymond 
remained with the mclaughlin family 
at age 2 he was moved to the williams home under a city policy 
that tries to match children with culturally similar foster parents 
the mclaughlins challenged the policy in august a federal 
court ordered the child returned to their custody ruling the 
constitution prevented agencies from using race as the sole reason 
to remove a child from a foster home 
the williamses appealed the case 
a threejudge panel ruled tuesday that while the williamses have 
been superb foster parents a return to the mclaughlins offered 
raymond the best hope of realizing his full potential 
a report from dr eileen a bazelon a psychiatrist chosen by 
the city to examine raymond while he lived with each family said 
raymond had suffered depression and developmental problems after 
leaving the mclaughlins 
churchill said the decision set an important precedent 
this confirms that the city was wrong to remove the child on 
the basis of race that whats most important is the childs 
needs churchill said we believe that its the right decision 
and should have nationwide impact

tiananmen square a raucous rallying point for 
students demanding democratic rights by day at night becomes a 
carnival ground of concerts dancing and exotic food 
while thousands of students camped out on the square doze in 
rickety huts night owls sing folk songs and dance to tinny sounds 
from portable cassette players 
some sing chinese ballads or hearty renditions of lionel richie 
and john denver others croon peter paul and mary sometimes in 
english sometimes in chinese 
one night last week students held a talent show including 
serenaders and an amateur standup comic another night there was a 
huge rock concert with 10000 fans clustered around the base of 
the monument to the peoples heroes as popular chinese singers took 
turns at the mike 
ive been coming out here since the protests began said 
guitar strummer cai wei a 22yearold student at the central 
academy of fine arts the students on the square are exhausted 
so i try to provide some atmosphere for them 
cai clad only in a loose green shirt and smudged red shorts 
sings folk songs from the provinces such as the tragicomic tale of 
a man with a bad leg 
for the revolution for the party 
the cripple joined the army 
for the revolution for the party 
the cripple died for the army 
traditional and romantic numbers are in jabs at unpopular 
leaders are not 
unlike the strident chants of millions of protesters in the last 
two weeks taunting premier li peng and questioning the mental 
competence of aging senior leader deng xiaoping the balladeers 
dont poke fun at their enemies 
were not here to insult anybody were seeking political 
reforms said a student from beijing normal university who gave 
her name only as liu 
she was singing with about 20 other colleagues outside a 
clumsily built tent at 400 am 
a few couples stroll arminarm under a crescent moon in the 
vast expanse sweeping southward from the forbidden city where 
chinas emperors once lived though tiananmen has hardly become a 
lovers lane 
some slow dance at the minidances that spring up spontaneously 
swaying to drippy instrumental tunes from cassette players set on 
the ground 
with sundown the avenues bordering the square fill with vendors 
of barbecued mutton onion pancakes dumpling soup and noodles 
stretched from dough as you watch 
but most of the food goes to curious residents of the capital 
who come to tiananmen at night for a moonlit glimpse at the 
revolution which began may 13 with a hunger strike by some 3000 
students and swelled to more than 200000 before tapering off 
the students many from outlying provinces and most of them 
broke rely on donations for their meals usually a couple of buns 
twice a day sometimes with rice porridge and a bottle of chalky 
soda pop 
look how cracked my lips are said a rower from beijing 
physical education university i collapsed once during the hunger 
strike whats hardest is keeping up our strength 
its easier to stay up all night because of the cold the rower 
said if i sleep at night i get the chills he said squatting 
on a thick cotton jacket on tiananmens concrete pavement 
overnight temperatures drop to 52 degrees 
the food situation has improved lately said chen shounan of 
anhui industry institute the last couple of days we each got an 
egg with our meals 
the lamps glowing in the square go out around 515 am and the 
nights wind down with the raising of the national flag by a 
peoples liberation army honor guard at sunrise 
you see we are a patriotic movement nothing more said a 
beijing agricultural institute coed who stayed up to join about 100 
others and applaud the flagraising i may lose sleep but its 
worth it

hundreds of people cheered at calls for 
swift sure and lengthy imprisonment for sex offenders at a meeting 
prompted by the rape and mutilation of a young boy 
the case that has drawn us here tonight is everybodys worst 
nightmare the sadistic abuse of a child karen sundquist of 
the child guidance clinic said tuesday night 
more than 400 people filled the tacoma city light auditorium for 
the meeting which was punctuated by cheers applause and calls 
from the crowd for the death penalty at least another 50 people 
watched on closedcircuit television from down the hall and dozens 
were unable to get inside 
the meeting was organized by sexual assault counselors and 
community leaders to deal with the uproar after a 7yearold boy 
was raped and his penis cut off on may 20 more than 100000 has 
been raised or pledged from around the country for the youngster 
who is recovering 
charges of attempted murder rape and assault have been filed 
against earl kenneth shriner 39 diagnosed as retarded and 
confined in prison and mental health institutions five times since 
1965 
a legislative hearing on the case is scheduled friday in olympia 
i am angry im appalled im frustrated said pierce county 
executive joe stortini we must eliminate the gap between the 
mental health system and the criminal justice system 
county prosecutor john ladenburg drew one of the biggest cheers 
when he called for building a mental health prison 
he dismissed the notion that treatment could cure habitual child 
sex abusers as a 60s mentality thats not the reality 
mike comte of comte associates which provides therapy for sex 
offenders said the 200 people being treated in his program 
probably represent 2000 to 3000 victims 
but comte warned that incarcerating every sex offender 
indefinitely would mean 10 or 15 new prisons 
there was an uncomfortable stirring when comte said he 
recognized men in the audience who had been through treatment 
successfully and are now lawabiding taxpaying citizens 
loud applause also followed calls for more widespread and 
explicit warnings about sex offenders including publicizing their 
names once they have completed prison terms also popular were 
calls for laws to ensure that more sex offenders are locked up and 
fewer are released 
most audience members were orderly during the twohour session 
but a few interrupted speakers with shouts like castrate him 
from one man and what about the death penalty for the 
untreatable from one woman 
others complained bitterly of being unable to get charges filed 
against exhusbands they claimed had abused their children and 
some said they now were afraid to let their children play outside 
do i tell my hyperactive child after they told me to let her 
run around outdoors as much as possible she has to stay in the 
house and drive all of us crazy one woman shouted 
no one who spoke from the audience gave his or her name 
state rep art wang dtacoma got a vocal response when he 
urged voter approval of a state constitutional amendment to bolster 
victims rights including a right to be heard at sentencing 
why wait till november one man shouted the legislature has 
already passed the amendment 
state attorney general ken eikenberry was among the crowd unable 
to get in the building he said he was ready to help draft 
legislation to keep dangerous sex offenders and those likely to 
commit sex offenses locked up 
petitions circulated inside and outside the building calling for 
a special session of the legislature for tougher laws against 
sexual crimes that cause severe bodily harm or death

prosecutors have dropped charges in a 
1987 child kidnapping case that had yielded a conviction of the 
wrong man and a mistrial for a second suspect 
box elder county attorney jon bunderson on tuesday filed a 
motion to dismiss charges of child kidnapping aggravated sexual 
abuse of a child and aggravated kidnapping against thomas c 
headley 32 
bunderson said he had consulted with the parents of the victim 
a 9yearold girl who was abducted from a schoolyard on march 24 
1987 sexually abused and abandoned the next day across the border 
in idaho 
i think this was a mutual decision we all reached bunderson 
said 
frank harvey 47 of elma wash was convicted in august 1987 
but released from prison four months later after authorities said 
they had evidence implicating headley 
a mistrial was declared in headleys trial may 19 after the 
eightmember jury became deadlocked and said it could not reach a 
decision because of a lack of facts 
bunderson said those difficulties were weighed in his decision 
to file the motion 
i dont see that another jury would do anything differently 
to tell the truth he said 
prosecutors also did not want to subject the girl to a third 
appearance on the witness stand 
the girl who was 6 at the time of her abduction had not 
identified harvey as her assailant but was able to pick headley of 
snowville out of a photo collage and a police lineup 
the case was further complicated when it was learned both 
suspects drove blue cars smoked cigarettes with brown tips and 
owned the same breed of dog

a threat from entertainer joey bishop and two 
anonymous telephone calls prompted cotton club producer roy 
radin to hire a bodyguard about six months before he was killed 
radins former assistant testified 
at a preliminary hearing for three defendants tuesday jonathan 
lawson said radin sought protection after bishop threatened to 
call out the philadelphia mafia on him 
bishop has not been named in the case a telephone call to a 
number listed as his residence yielded no answer tuesday evening 
attorneys for the defendants were trying to show that many other 
people had motives to kill radin an obese cocainesniffing 
producer whose first attempt at hollywood moviemaking was aborted 
by his slaying 
the prosecution contends that reputed drug dealer karen delayne 
greenberger arranged radins murder after they fought about her 
share of profits from the movie the cotton club 
mrs greenberger is charged along with alex lamota marti 
william molony mentzer and robert ulmer lowe former bodyguards for 
hustler magazine publisher larry flynt lowe is fighting 
extradition in maryland the current hearing will determine whether 
mrs greenberger mentzer and marti stand trial 
six months before his disappearance lawson recalled that radin 
hired a former wrestler named sal to guard him he was asked to 
explain 
we had a very bad experience in atlantic city nj said 
lawson 
asked to explain lawson replied joey bishop made threats to 
him and threatened to call out the philadelphia mafia on him 
this took place in atlantic city 
he indicated bishop was part of a show radin had staged at 
ballys casino in the gambling resort 
were you present when the threats were made asked attorney 
richard hirsch 
i was present in the office at ballys when joey bishop 
pointed a finger at roy and said ill see that youre 
straightened out because youre in my territory now radin said 
he did not explain what triggered the remarks and further 
questioning was cut off by municipal court judge patti jo mckay 
who ruled it was irrelevant 
lawson said that in the months leading up to radins may 1983 
disappearance at least two anonymous phone callers threatened 
radins life 
he quoted one of the callers as saying radin has been 
shooting off his mouth too much he should take the deal the way it 
is and shut his mouth 
the second caller he said warned that if radin didnt heed 
warnings hell find himself dead 
radins show business connections have added glitter to the 
case actor demond wilson of tvs sanford and son was scheduled 
to take the stand sometime today 
former paramount pictures chief robert evans who initially was 
implicated in the case invoked fifth amendment protection against 
self incrimination and refused to testify he and radin 
collaborated on raising money for the cotton club production 
after they were introduced by mrs greenberger 
radin disappeared after leaving for dinner with mrs greenberger 
on may 13 1983 his body was found a month later in a dry riverbed 
65 miles north of los angeles he had been shot repeatedly in the 
head 
the defense stepped up its attack on the dead mans character 
tuesday eliciting testimony that he physically abused his former 
wife used cocaine in excessive amounts and substituted the 
tranquilizer thorazine when he was withdrawing from cocaine

everything was set for the first date a nicely 
decorated room a convenient hammock various playthings and some 
water hoses and tranquilizer darts just so things wouldnt get out 
of hand 
after all willie b hadnt been with a female for 28 years and 
it wasnt clear how the silverback lowland gorilla would react 
i hope the gorillas not as nervous as i am atlanta zoo 
director terry maple said before tuesdays meeting 
the 30yearold male gorilla was introduced to a pair of female 
gorillas in a specially designed room he had been isolated from 
others of his kind for 28 years allowed to observe other gorillas 
only from a distance and through heavy mesh 
but neither willie b nor the two females 6yearold kinyani 
and 26yearold katoomba showed any shyness both females are 
from the yerkes regional primate research center at emory 
university 
kinyani and katoomba were free to decide whether to join willie 
b by using an overhead door large enough for them but too small 
for willie b they waltzed right in maple said 
two other doors just big enough for kinyani and katoomba to 
escape were available both used the doors several times but always 
returned to the room maple said 
after willie made a few rushes katoomba responded with charges 
of her own and soon willie gave way letting the female chase him 
around the room 
this may be her social experience showing through said 
kenneth gould chief of reproductive biology at yerkes shes 
been through introductions before and has a history of being able 
to look after herself 
a staring match followed but after it broke up the gorillas sat 
in relative quiet 
it couldnt be going any better maple said so far 
willie has proved to be very normal in the behaviors he has shown 
during the socialization process 
erika archibald a spokeswoman for the zoo said the norm among 
gorillas is for each male to hang out with a group of females 
male gorillas tend to be antagonistic toward one another and could 
fight 
this is just a period of socialization for willie b she 
said 
dates will continue each day in the 37 by 20foot room maple 
said zoo officials hope the gorillas will mold themselves into a 
family with katoomba eventually bearing willies child 
next week officials plan to let the gorillas continue their 
courtship outdoors there are three other gorilla troops in the 
45 million ford african rain forest habitat the troops are 
separated by moats 
if all goes well with willie bs introduction we will be the 
only zoo to have four gorilla troops on exhibit every day maple 
said

dead animals are piling up in 
refrigerated trailers on the coast as officials collect evidence of 
the vast damage caused by the oil spilled from the tanker exxon 
valdez 
the carcasses of 22818 migratory birds 733 sea otters and 51 
birds of prey most of them bald eagles had been collected tagged 
and stored by tuesday at four coastal cities 
its a morbid milestone we have reached this week more than 
two months after the oil spill from the exxon valdez we are still 
counting its victims said walter stieglitz alaska regional 
director of the us fish and wildlife service 
the gooey fingers of the spill have drifted more than 500 miles 
from prince william sound across the gulf of alaska and beyond 
kodiak island about 11 million gallons of oil spilled from gashes 
in the exxon valdez when it ran aground march 24 
more than 70 species of birds have been affected the wildlife 
service said about 60 percent of the dead birds are murres an 
upright seabird with tuxedolike markings 
the carcasses in cold storage may represent only a small 
percentage of the total number of animals killed by the spill 
officials have said 
they are saying these numbers are about 5 percent of the 
actual number impacted from this said craig tidrick a fish and 
wildlife service employee in valdez the carcasses are being 
saved for evidence for the courts 
surveys are underway but the federal government has not yet 
made an official estimate of the wildlife deaths

here is the text of president bushs 
speech on eastwest relations as delivered wednesday 
thank you chancellor helmut kohl at the outset let me tell 
you that lest you think that he has forgotten his home state 
because he is the chancellor of the federal republic i will only 
tell you that in the last 24 hours chancellor kohl has been 
convincing me that when i came to this state and to mainz i would 
be coming to heaven and having gotten here i think he may just 
about be right ill tell you thank you all very much 
dr carl ludwig wagner governor of the rhinelandpalatinate 
state lord mayor distinguished hosts i want to also thank these 
two bands west german and american for that stirring music and 
chancellor kohl i especially want to thank you again for inviting 
me to this beautiful and ancient city on my first presidential trip 
to the republic of germany the federal republic 
and herr kohl and i have concluded now our deliberations at the 
nato summit in brussels an excellent start to our working 
partnership as chancellor and president 
and here in mainz by the banks of the rhine its often said 
that this heartland of mountain vineyards and villages embodies the 
very soul of germany so mainz provides a fitting forum for an 
american president to address the german people 
today i come to speak not just of our mutual defense but of our 
shared values i come to speak not just of our the matters of the 
mind but of the deeper aspirations of the heart 
just this morning barbara and i were charmed with the 
experiences we had i met with a group small group of german 
students bright young men and women who studied in the united 
states their knowledge of our country and the world was 
impressive to say the least 
but sadly too many in the west americans and europeans alike 
seem to have forgotten the lessons of our common heritage and how 
the world we know came to be and that should not be and that 
cannot be 
we must recall that the generation coming into its own in 
america and western europe is heir to gifts greater than those 
bestowed to any generation in history peace freedom and 
prosperity

a federal judge says the state is 
violating the constitutional rights of prison inmates serving life 
sentences by barring them from getting married 
us district judge neal p mccurn said the state law violates 
the inmates right to equal protection and creates an 
impermissible distinction between them and inmates married 
before sentencing 
it is inconceivable to this court how marital status is in 
any way relevant to punishment mccurn wrote in a decision issued 
friday 
the state department of correctional services was sued by inmate 
richard langone and dari schmall 
langone 32 has served about 13 years of a 15 yearstolife 
sentence for seconddegree murder for a shooting when he was 18 
since october he has been on a workrelease program in new york 
city 
schmall 23 is expecting the couples first child she said 
they have been engaged about five years 
the state attorney generals office has not decided whether to 
appeal spokeswoman nancy connell said tuesday 
the corrections department had no comment until it could review

this inheritance is possible because 40 years ago the nations of 
the west joined in that noble common cause called nato first there 
was the vision the concept of free peoples in north america and 
europe working to protect their values and second there was the 
practical sharing of risks and burdens in a realistic recognition 
of soviet expansionism 
and finally there was the determination to look beyond old 
animosities the nato alliance did nothing less than provide a way 
for western europe to heal centuriesold rivalries to begin an era 
of reconciliation and restoration it has been in fact a second 
renaissance of europe 
as you know best this is not just the 40th birthday of the 
alliance its also the 40th birthday of the federal republic a 
republic born in hope tempered by challenge at the height of the 
berlin crisis in 1948 ernst reuter called on germans to stand firm 
and confident and you did courageously magnificently 
the historic genius of the german people has flourished in this 
age of peace and your nation has become a leader in technology 
the fourthlargest economy on earth but more important youve 
inspired the world by forcefully promoting the principles of human 
rights democracy and freedom 
the united states and the federal republic have always been firm 
friends and allies but today we share an added role partnersd in 
leadership of course leadership has a constant companion 
responsibility and our responsibility is to look ahead and grasp 
the promise of the future 
i said recently that were at the end of one era and at the 
beginning of another and i noted that in regard to the soviet 
union our policy is to move beyond containment 
for 40 years the seeds of democracy in eastern europe lay 
dormant buried under the frozen tundra of the cold war and for 40 
years the world has waited for the cold war to end and decade 
after decade time after time the flowering human spirit withered 
from the chill of conflict and oppression and again the world 
waited 
but the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever the world 
has waited long enough the time is right let europe be whole and 
free 
to the founders of the alliance this aspiration was a distant 
dream and now its the new mission of nato if ancient rivals like 
britain and france or france and germany can reconcile then why 
not the nations of the east and west 
in the east brave men and women are showing us the way look at 
poland where solidarity and the catholic church have won legal 
status the forces of freedom are putting the soviet status quo on 
the defensive 
in the west we have succeeded because weve been faithful to 
our values and our vision and on the other side of the rusting 
iron curtain their vision failed the cold war began with the 
division of europe it can only end when europe is whole 
and today it is this very concept of a divided europe that is 
under siege and thats why our hopes run especially high because 
the division of europe is under siege not by armies but by the 
spread of ideas that began here right here it was a son of mainz 
johannes gutenberg who liberated the mind of man through the power 
of the printed word and that same liberating power is unleashed 
today in a hundred new forms

this looks like any former company town in 
west virginia with parallel rows of virtually identical houses a 
small soapsudfilled creek flowing past back yards and a 
playedout mine 
but residents are worried about something unseen that sets 
minden apart it may be contaminated with cancercausing chemicals 
for years shafer equipment co removed oil from old electrical 
transformers they were rebuilding burning some oil for heat 
giving some to residents to use in furnaces and dumping the rest in 
a pit at the mouth of the former minden mine residents say 
the oil is laced with polychlorinated biphenyls known to cause 
cancer in laboratory animals pcbs bond to soil and are not 
watersoluble so any contaminated oil dumped 15 years ago could 
still present a health risk 
frequent floods along arbuckle creek which flows through town 
have dumped tons of mud from the plant into yards and basements 
oak hill a city of 9200 a few miles to the west also gets much 
of its water from the area 
when you sit and think that weve been exposed to this 
contamination for 15 years said resident sue workman im of 
the opinion there is no way they could ever clean it up 
the federal environmental protection agency has spent 3 million 
cleaning up the plant hauling away 4735 tons of contaminated 
dirt 110 drums of contaminated liquids and solids 23 drums of 
electric capacitors and 21 transformers said agency spokeswoman 
theresa bickel in philadelphia last month the agency agreed to 
test the soil within three miles of the site 
but some residents who have formed a group called concerned 
citizens to save fayette county think no amount of work will make 
the town safe they want a state or federal buyout of their town 
and creation of a new minden somewhere else at an estimated cost 
at 20 million 
money should that be a consideration when peoples lives are 
at stake asked workman 30 the mother of two 
simply moving is out of the question for most of the towns 300 
families because no one wants to buy a house here she said you 
cant give a piece of property away she said 
the epa soil study will begin in september and take at least six 
months said loretta haddy an epidemiologist with the state health 
department if high levels of pcbs are found the centers for 
disease control will investigate whether they have caused any 
health problems 
a state health department study of the towns mortality figures 
from 1979 to 1985 found nothing unusual 
but a study by vanderbilt university students last year came up 
with vastly different results 
the students found traces of pcbs in soil taken from 17 of 19 
sites they also surveyed 173 residents and found 62 percent of the 
women surveyed had suffered miscarriages or stillbirths or had 
children with birth defects 
sixteen percent said they had cancer 18 percent suffered from 
liver disorders 34 percent had skin problems ranging from dryness 
to hair loss and 31 percent reported a persistent cough all 
apparent symptoms of pcb contact 
we dont know anything about the protocol for the study the 
methods they used anything about the study haddy said but 
added were interested in what they came up with 
but workman and other residents complain bitterly about the 
department 
theyve ignored our pleas and finally we had to go elsewhere 
to get help workman said 
lucian randall a laidoff miner says he has evidence of pcb 
contamination in the palm of his hand a recurring scaly patch he 
worked for about two years as a security guard during the first 
cleanup of the site he says tests have shown his blood contains 
pcbs 
sure im worried but im 62 said randall who lives 100 
yards from the plant im worried about the kids around here 
the fayette county board of education plans to shut minden 
elementary school at the end of this school year saying there 
arent enough students to keep it open but some are sure the board 
doesnt think its safe to keep children in minden 
i dont think anybody in our group would say every health 
problem in minden is caused by pcbs workman said but the 
health problems are incredible and the stress of not knowing what 
to expect its incredible

the centennial of the giant flood that 
swept 2209 people to their deaths under a 70foot wall of water is 
being marked today with a torchlight pageant and memorials 
the flood they say is an old story but it isnt its as 
new as three mile island its as new as chernobyl its as new as 
the alaskan oil spill said david mccullough who wrote a book 
about the flood 
the johnstown flood was the nations secondworst natural 
disaster a tidal wave killed about 5000 people at galveston 
texas in 1900 
floodwaters from lake conemaugh a private resort created by 
wealthy industrialists broke through a poorly constructed earthen 
dam on may 31 1889 after several days of rain 
the waters swept 14 miles down the little conemaugh river valley 
and slammed into the town of 10000 people virtually washing it 
away in about 10 minutes 
a huge pile of debris containing scores of survivors of the 
flood piled up against the pennsylvania railroads stone bridge 
which still stands across the conemaugh river just below downtown 
and caught fire causing more deaths 
as part of todays observance officials are opening a new 
national park service visitors center and the renovated johnstown 
flood museum 
a memorial is scheduled at point stadium near the stone bridge 
and will include the lighting of a torch the ringing of church 
bells sirens brief fireworks and a citywide moment of silence 
the two living survivors of the flood elsie frum 106 and 
frank shomo 100 will be the guests of honor at the annual 
survivors banquet at christ the saviour cathedral in downtown

the voice of america deutsche welle allow us to enlighten 
millions deep within eastern europe and throughout the world 
television satellites allow us to bear witness from the shipyards 
of gdansk to tiananmen square but the momentum for freedom does 
not just come from the printed word or the transistor or the 
television screen 
it comes from a single powerful idea democracy 
this one idea this one idea is sweeping across eurasia this 
one idea is why the communist world from budapest to beijing is 
in ferment and of course for the leaders of the east its not 
just freedom for freedoms sake but whatever their motivation 
they are unleashing a force they will find difficult to channel or 
control the hunger for liberty of oppressed peoples whove tasted 
freedom 
nowhere is this more apparent than in eastern europe the 
birthplace of the cold war 
in poland at the end of world war ii the soviet army prevented 
the free elections promised by stalin at yalta and today poles 
are taking the first steps toward real elections so long promised 
so long deferred and in hungary at last we see a chance for 
multiparty competition at the ballot box 
and as president i will continue to do all i can to help open 
the closed societies to the east we seek selfdetermination for 
all of germany and all of eastern europe and we will and we 
will not relax and we must not waver again the world has waited 
long enough 
but democracys journey east is not easy intellectuals like 
the great czech playwright vaclav havel still work under the 
shadow of coercion and repression still menaces too many peoples 
of eastern europe barriers and barbed wire still fence in nations 
so when i visit poland and hungary this summer i will deliver 
this message there cannot be a common european home until all 
within it are free to move from room to room and ill take another 
message the path of freedom leads to a larger home a home where 
west meets east a democratic home the commonwealth of free 
nations 
and i said that positive steps by the soviets would be met by 
steps of our own and this is why i announced on may 12th a 
readiness to consider granting to the soviets temporary waiver of 
the jacksonvanik trade restrictions if they liberalize emigration 
and this is also why i announced on monday that the united 
states is prepared to drop the no exceptions standard that has 
guided our approach to controlling the export of technology to the 
soviet union lifting a sanction enacted in response to their 
invasion of afghanistan and in this same spirit in this same 
spirit i set forth four proposals to heal europes tragic 
division to help europe become whole and free 
first i propose we strengthen and broaden the helsinki process 
to promote free elections and political pluralism in eastern 
europe as the forces of freedom and democracy rise in the east so 
should our expectations and weaving together the slender threads 
of freedom in the east will require much from the western 
democracies 
in particular the great political parties of the west must 
assume an historic responsibility to lend counsel and support to 
those brave men and women who are trying to form the first truly 
representative political parties in the east to advance freedom 
and democracy to part the iron curtain

foreign minister sousuke uno today agreed to become 
the next prime minister after leaders of the scandalridden 
governing party bucking stubborn resistance decided he was the 
best person for the job a party official said 
uno in paris on official business agreed in a telephone call 
to take the jobs of party head and government leader after 
expressing some reluctance ryutaro hashimoto deputy party 
secretarygeneral told a news conference 
i am not confident i can handle the job when the party is 
facing such a difficult time hashimoto quoted uno as telling 
him but now that the party is in an unprecedented crisis i will 
commit myself for the party 
hashimoto said leaders of the governing liberal democratic party 
decided that uno 66 is the most suited candidate as successor 
to prime minister noboru takeshita who is resigning to take 
responsibility for an influencepeddling scandal involving the 
recruit co 
recruit an information and publishing conglomerate is accused 
of seeking favors and influence through political donations and 
bargainpriced share transactions that benefited leading 
politicians 
those linked to the scandal include yasuhiro nakasone 
takeshitas predecessor takeshita and party secretarygeneral 
shintaro abe 
uno is not known to have received recruit money that and his 
expertise in foreign affairs were said to be his main selling 
points 
but some opposed uno because he is a senior member of the party 
faction of nakasone during whose 198287 tenure most of the 
recruit scandal took place 
i am outraged by this nonsense of giving the countrys highest 
office which only one person can assume to a sort of managing 
director of the nakasone company former prime minister takeo 
fukuda told reporters after hashimotos announcement 
fukudas name was one of many that surfaced during the long 
search for a successor to takeshita 
hashimoto said the decision to pick uno was worked out in 
daylong meetings involving himself takeshita masayoshi ito 
chairman of the party executive council michio watanabe chairman 
of the policy board and ichiro yamanouchi party leader in the 
upper house of the diet japans parliament 
he said party legislators would probably confirm uno as party 
leader friday the parliament where the governing party has a big 
majority then will vote on uno for prime minister 
before hashimotos announcement a group of 48 younger 
legislators said party leaders should halt their search for a new 
prime minister and take responsibility for the recruit scandal 
first in effect resign their party posts 
now that the party had adopted measures to take responsiblity 
for the scandal we demand the party to implement them first 
said shizuka kamei head of the liberal progressive alliance if 
party leaders are going to neglect responsibility measures and 
appoint a new prime minister we are prepared to support our own 
candidate 
party elders such as former prime ministers fukuda and zenko 
suzuki suggested a separation of the jobs of party head and prime 
minister 
the party elders had argued it would be too much a burden for a 
prime minister to also handle party reform 
the prime minister has to be one person but difficulties in 
the party will not allow one person to handle both the party and 
the government fukuda told reporters i suggested something 
like a collective leadership in the party

a bill to restrict the use of untraceable license 
plates originally intended for undercover police officers has 
been introduced after statusconscious politicians began using the 
eversosecret tags 
the issue came to light when state literacy chief gerard damico 
acknowledged and apologized in early may for running up 900 in 
parking tickets on his state car which was outfitted with 
confidential plates that even the registry of motor vehicles 
couldnt track 
damico chalked up the tickets to carelessness and 
stupidity paid the tickets turned in his state car and said he 
hoped the incident wouldnt hurt his bid for lieutenant governor in 
1990 
the confidential plates look just like those issued to any other 
massachusetts driver the bill to restrict their use to law 
enforcement officers was introduced tuesday by state rep peter 
torkildsen 
since administration and finance secretary edward lashman issued 
an internal memorandum april 5 asking all agencies to detail and 
justify their confidential plates three cabinet secretaries have 
turned in their secret tags 
lashmans agency has given 35 administrative officials 
permission to retain the plates 769 plates have been issued to law 
enforcement officials or other investigatory officers 
the administration believes torkildsens legislation should 
allow exceptions for officials who receive death threats and for 
investigatory units that are not strictly law enforcement such as 
alcohol beverage control commission investigators 
for example revenue commissioner stephen kidder has one of the 
confidential plates because of the frequent threats he gets as the 
states chief tax collector

soviet bloc allies at eastwest 
disarmament talks in vienna are praising president bushs proposals 
for big cuts in american and soviet forces in europe media reports 
said today 
we were pleasantly surprised by the details of president 
bushs initiative hungarys ambassador to austria david 
meiszter told a plenary session his comments were reported by 
hungarys official mti news agency 
if his proposals come up for discussion at the conference 
here these will be in our opinion the most important western 
initiatives on arms reduction since the signing of the inf 
agreement meiszter told delegates tuesday likening the 
initiative to the 1987 treaty eliminating mediumrange nuclear 
missiles 
the talks on conventional forces in europe which started here 
in march aim to reduce the element of a surprise attack by 
establishing a secure and stable balance of conventional forces 
from the atlantic to the ural mountains 
in compliance with president bushs proposals the way is open 
for a comprehensive agreement on the reduction of the most 
destabilizing military units mti quoted meiszter as saying 
bush seized the initiative in eastwest relations monday by 
proposing a 20 percent cut in us combat troops in europe and a 
ceiling of 275000 soldiers on each side requiring the soviets to 
demobilize 325000 troops on the continent 
the warsaw pact on tuesday proposed limits for conventional 
armaments in the central european zone where most deadly weaponry 
is massed on the continent 
east german ambassador klausdieter ernst presented reporters 
with proposals to cut back on six types of weapons by 199697 and 
limit each side to 570000 troops 420 tactical aircraft 800 
combat helicopters 8700 tanks 7600 artillery pieces and 14500 
armored troop carriers 
countries included in the proposal are czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary and poland from the east and from the western 
nato alliance belgium denmark luxembourg the netherlands and 
west germany 
speaking for the warsaw pact ernst chided the west for refusing 
to include strike aircraft combat helicopters and manpower in the 
first agreement on conventional forces 
nato saying it wants results soon proposes first reducing 
three kinds of weapons 
bush announced limits on tanks armored troop carrriers and

in fact its already begun to part the frontier of barbed wire 
and minefields between hungary and austria is being removed foot 
by foot mile by mile just as the barriers are coming down in 
hungary so must they fall throughout all of eastern europe let 
berlin be next let berlin be next 
nowhere is the division between east and west seen more clearly 
than in berlin there the brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor 
brother from brother and that wall stands as a monument to the 
failure of communism it must come down 
now glasnost may be a russian word but openness is a 
western concept west berlin has always enjoyed the openness of a 
free city and our proposal would make all berlin a center of 
commerce between east and west a place of cooperation not a point 
of confrontation and we rededicate ourselves to the 1987 allied 
initiative to strengthen freedom and security in that divided city 
this then is my second proposal bring glasnost to east berlin 
my generation remembers a europe ravaged by war and of course 
europe has long since rebuilt its proud cities and restored its 
majestic cathedrals but what a tragedy it would be if your 
continent was again spoiled this time by a more subtle and 
insidious danger that the chancellor referred to that of poisoned 
rivers acid rain americas faced an environmental tragedy in 
alaska countries from france to finland suffered after chernobyl 
west germany is struggling to save the black forest today and 
throughout we have all learned a terrible lesson environmental 
destruction respects no borders 
so my third proposal is to work together on these environmental 
problems with the united states and western europe extending a 
hand to the east since much remains to be done in both east and 
west we ask eastern europe to join us in this common struggle 
we can offer technical training and assistance in drafting laws 
and regulations and new technologies for tackling these awesome 
problems and i invite the environmentalists and engineers of the 
east to visit the west to share knowledge so we can succeed in 
this great cause 
my fourth proposal actually a set of proposals concerns a less 
militarized europe the most heavily armed continent in the world 
nowhere is this more important than in the two germanys 
and thats why our quest to safely reduce armaments has a 
special significance for the german people to those who are 
impatient with our measured pace in arms reduction i respectfully 
suggest that history teaches us a lesson that unity and strength 
are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms control weve always 
believed that a strong western defense is the best road to peace 
and 40 years of experience have proven us right 
but weve done more than just keep the peace by standing 
together we have convinced the soviets that their arms buildup has 
been costly and pointless let us not give them incentives to 
return to the policies of the past let us give them every reason 
to abandon the arms race for the sake of the human race 
in this era of both negotiation and armed camps america 
understands that west germany bears a special burden of course in 
this nuclear age every nation is on the front line but not all 
free nations are called to endure the tension of regular military 
activity or the constant presence of foreign military forces 
we are sensitive to these special conditions that this needed 
presence imposes to significantly ease the burden of armed camps 
in europe we must be aggressive in our pursuit of solid 
verifiable agreements between nato and the warsaw pact 
on monday with my nato colleagues in brussels i shared my 
great hope for the future of conventional negotiations in europe i 
shared with them a proposal for achieving significant reductions in 
the near future and as you know the warsaw pact has now accepted 
major elements of our western approach to the new conventional arms 
negotiations in vienna 
the eastern bloc acknowledges that a substantial imbalance 
exists between the conventional forces of the two alliances and 
theyve moved closer to natos position by accepting most elements 
of our initial conventional arms proposal these encouraging steps 
have produced the opportunity for creative and decisive action and 
we shall not let that opportunity pass

state law needs to catch up with lifesupport 
technology and help avoid another case like that of rudy linares a 
distraught father who disconnected his comatose sons respirator at 
gunpoint a prosecutor says 
the linares case is now closed but the issues raised by that 
affair are very much alive cook county states attorney cecil 
partee said tuesday as he announced formation of a 43member task 
force to recommend legal changes to the illinois legislature 
legal medical and religious experts are all represented on the 
panel which should help produce a law that more clearly defines 
roles of patients family members and doctors in lifeanddeath 
decisions partee said 
linares 23 disconnected the life support system for his 
15monthold son samuel at a chicago hospital on april 26 he 
held the baby in his arms until samuel was dead while holding 
hospital personnel at bay at gunpoint 
the boy had been in a coma considered irreversible by doctors 
since choking on a balloon nine months earlier the hospital had 
refused family requests to withdraw life support saying the child 
was not brain dead 
partees office charged linares with murder but a grand jury 
refused to indict him 
partee said the task force will seek legal answers to such 
questions as when death occurs under what circumstances 
lifesupport equipment can be removed who decides on such removal 
and what procedures to follow before life support is withdrawn 
two members of the panel who appeared at a news conference with 
partee former us district judge george leighton and chicago 
lawyer james serritella whose firm represents the roman catholic 
archdiocese of chicago said they do not believe a new law should 
require involving a judge in every case 
these things are fastmoving leighton said imagine the 
case of a parent of a child in a lifesupport system and some 
hysterical situation arises you mean you have to wait until monday 
when the court convenes to do something about it 
these are the practical and sometimes philosophical questions 
involved 
partee said while some laws concerning lifesupport do exist 
interpretations in illinois and throughout the country vary widely 
the linares case ended two weeks ago when the young father 
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge and was sentenced to 
conditional discharge and counseling if needed no jail time was 
ordered 
the cook county medical examiner who had said he could not 
determine the cause of death ruled samuels death accidental after 
the grand jury decision 
linares a house painter has since said he saw no alternative 
to his action because his sons continuing ordeal was just 
tearing apart the whole family

boris n yeltsin charged today that the soviet 
people are worse off now than they were before mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms and he said the president has accumulated so 
much power there is danger of a dictatorship 
the former moscow party boss proposed radical changes that would 
take control of soviet society away from the 20millionmember 
communist party and make the party subservient to the newly elected 
congress of peoples deputies on which yeltsin serves 
his proposals also would require the president to submit to an 
annual nationwide referendum on his performance 
in another challenge to traditional soviet power the president 
of the latvian republic anatoly v gorbunov proposed making the 
soviet unions 15 republics sovereign states that could decide what 
functions to give the kremlin 
gorbachev sitting erect on the dais at yeltsins back kept a 
stoic face throughout the speech scanning the congress hall for 
the deputies reaction 
gorbunov like yeltsin a gorbachev protege said the republics 
should be given power over their own resources and full state 
authority 
latvias sister baltic state estonia declared itself sovereign 
last fall with the right to overturn soviet laws on its territory 
the third baltic state lituania followed estonias lead two weeks 
ago 
the promised program and the promises of the past four years 
have not been met yeltsin said in his first nationally televised 
speech as a parliamentarian people live worse the leadership 
knows that 
he said he held gorbachev responsible 
yeltsin said the soviet leader had been given extraordinary 
powers in the political overhaul that created the congress and 
he suggested gorbachev might be tempted as past kremlin chiefs 
have to abuse his power 
gorbachev obviously sensitive to such charges promised 
congress before he was elected last week that he never would take 
advantage of the increased power of the presidency 
but yeltsin warned we can again be under a new 
totalitarian regime under a new dictatorship 
yeltsin fired from his job as moscow party chief in 1987 for 
criticizing the pace of gorbachevs reforms called on congress to 
abolish all unlawlful privileges for the nomenklatura yes and 
in general strike this word from our lexicon 
nomenklatura refers to the party and government elite who 
receive special privileges as a result of their positions or those 
of their families 
he also proposed making medicines and mass transit free for 
invalids and tens of millions of poor soviets 
his speech came on the sixth day of the new congress inaugural 
session the 17minute speech was occasionally interrupted by not 
particularly enthusiastic applause 
members of the partys ruling politburo were among those who did 
not clap 
on thursday the congress elected gorbachev who is also the 
communist party chief to a fiveyear term as president 
yeltsin proposed that gorbachev be subject to a nationwide vote 
of confidence each year 
he also called for changes in the partys policymaking central 
committee on which he serves saying some occupants have not done 
their job 
towering over the rostrum at the kremlin palace of congresses 
yeltsin proposed a law to regulate the functions of the communist 
party which has held a legal monopoly on power for more than 70 
years 
power by right should belong to the people in the form of the 
organ it elects that is the congress yeltsin said 
legal limits on the partys prerogatives would be a 
revolutionary development in soviet politics where for decades 
party officials have dominated the apparatus of government and 
turned legislative organs at all levels into docile rubberstamp 
bodies 
gorbachev has said his reforms are designed to separate the 
government and party bureaucracies get the party out of daytoday 
public affairs and let the popularly elected congress and its 
standing legislature set policy and law 
yeltsins proposal would go considerably further by giving 
popularly elected lawmakers such as himself the power to limit the 
partys role 
yeltsin won more votes than any other deputy elected to the 
congress with almost 90 percent of moscow voters casting ballots 
for him in march 
his fellow deputies initially denied him a seat in elections for 
the smaller fulltime legislature the supreme soviet but yeltsin 
was granted a seat monday after another legislator gave up his seat 
on condition yeltsin could fill it 
after yeltsins speech vice president anatoly lukyanov elected 
monday with gorbachevs backing said i think the partys 
position in our country is just fine 
but revas tabukashvili a deputy from soviet georgia said the 
powertransfer proposal might eventually succeed and he believed 
gorbachev would support it 
moscow deputy yuri vlasov also criticized gorbachev saying he 
found it hard to believe the presidents statement tuesday that he 
knew nothing about a deadly clash between soldiers and 
proindependence protesters in georgia until the day after it 
happened 
the clash in april resulted in 19 deaths 
what kind of head of state is he if he doesnt know when the 
troops start to act vlasov asked

about 4000 farmers workers and students burned 
chinas bestknown dissident in effigy today in the first 
governmentsponsored rally since the prodemocracy student movement 
began six weeks ago 
the rally in huangcun 20 miles south of beijing came as 
communist authorities pressed ahead with tactics aimed at 
intimidating and discrediting the 10000 students occupying central 
tiananmen square 
several people said officials forced them to participate in the 
40minute rally in support of premier li pengs hardline policies 
also today about 3000 prodemocracy students marched from 
tiananmen square to city police headquarters where they held a 
sitin to protest the arrests of three labor leaders 
they also demanded the resignations of senior leader deng 
xiaoping and li who imposed martial law in beijing on may 20 and 
ordered a crackdown on workers pressing for a freer china 
zhao pinglu head of the independent trade union to which the 
workers belonged said they were released late this afternoon after 
being questioned for a day about the new unions activities 
chinas communist government bans all but the official all china 
federation of trade unions 
down with kidnapping the students shouted it was the 
second straight day of protests in front of the police office 
at the governmentsponsored rally demonstrators marched to an 
outdoor stadium carying banners reading we support li peng and 
we oppose the small group causing turmoil 
the event lacked enthusiasm of the demonstrations in beijing 
where hundreds of thousands of people have marched to demand 
democratic reforms and an end to official corruption 
rally leaders burned an effigy of astrophysicist fang lizhi an 
outspoken proponent of democracy but they failed to stir the crowd 
few joined leaders in shouting slogans such as long live the 
communist party and down with fang lizhi students responded 
to the slogans with giggles 
they told me to come so ive come said one 27yearold 
peasant in the crowd 
to tell you the truth we were forced to come said an 
18yearold high school student some participants said they did 
not understand the purpose of the demonstration 
the beijing foreign affairs office informed foreign journalists 
of the march and of several others in suburban sections of the 
capital 
martial law regulations which have been widely ignored forbid 
foreign reporters from covering student demonstrations 
at tiananmen square chinas symbolic center of political power 
about 10000 diehard student protesters entered the 18th day of a 
sitin resisting government demands they disperse 
we are now basically waiting for the government to take the 
initiative student leader mo bin said things are pretty calm 
with us its the government whos nervous 
more than a dozen military motorcycle convoys followed by jeeps 
sped down the main arteries of the capital the latest warning that 
government tolerance was nearing an end 
a military source said 200000 troops surrounding beijing have 
been told to prepare for winter meaning hardliners are digging 
in for a long battle with communist party moderates who sympathize 
with some goals of the students 
wan li a reformer and head of the national peoples congress 
or parliament returned to beijing today a week after reportedly 
being stopped in shanghai on his way back from a trip to the united 
states 
chinese sources said wan who made statements in support of the 
students while in the united states was put under house arrest in 
shanghai but after several days there he was quoted as giving full 
backing to the government 
the government said wan stopped in shanghai for medical 
treatment he was shown on the television news being helped off the 
airplane by a flight attendant but otherwise he looked healthy 
a government propaganda campaign against the students continued 
to center on a replica of the statue of liberty called the 
goddess of democracy unveiled on tiananmen square on tuesday 
the statue faces the portrait of communist chinese founder mao 
tsetung 
the beijing daily a conservative party paper was filled with 
articles and letters incensed about the 33foot statue 
we believe our sincere patriotic enthusiasm has been greatly 
mocked and our good image tarnished said a letter from five 
unidentified beijing university students 
state radio beijing gave prominent play to divisions in the 
student movement in an interview with li lu a beijing student 
leader who accused nonbeijing students of power grabbing

a federal judge says the first amendments 
protection of free speech for us citizens extends to 
international libel cases a ruling that could have broad 
implications for american speakers and authors 
ruling in a 100 million lawsuit brought by former indian prime 
minister morarji desai us district judge charles norgle said 
tuesday that it must be proven that journalist and author seymour 
hersh intentionally distributed a libelous book in india 
desais lawsuit contends the former prime minister was defamed 
in hershs book the price of power kissinger in the nixon white 
house which said desai sold state secrets to the central 
intelligence agency 
attorneys for 94yearold desai sought to recover damages based 
on the lesser standard of negligence rather than the actual 
malice standard required under us law in libel cases that 
involve public figures 
but norgle said us legal standards will be applied to the case 
since desai has acknowledged being a public figure the judge 
added in a written opinion that to apply indian defamation law or 
any other foreign defamation law at odds with the first amendment 
could have a tremendous chilling effect 
legal experts say norgles ruling is the first of its kind and 
signals protections for us authors speechmakers and publishers 
whose domestically produced works are later published or 
distributed abroad 
trial is set for sept 13 the 6yearold lawsuit was filed in 
chicago under the principle of filing defamation actions in the

riot police swinging truncheons today 
arrested hundreds of students who tried to march to seouls 
catholic cathedral in support of antigovernment hunger strikers 
about 5000 riot troopers in helmets and combat fatigues stopped 
about 1000 students a few blocks from myongdong cathedral in the 
city center police charged into the students several times and 
dragged away struggling protesters in a confrontation that lasted 
about four hours 
some students tried to ram through police lines to reach the 
cathedral but most demonstrated peacefully 
police said at least 500 students were arrested riot troopers 
kicked and beat some protesters who were hauled away and police 
said there were injuries among both troopers and students but said 
they had no figures 
the students marched to the cathedral after 4000 others took 
part earlier in rallies at 13 seoul colleges they called for the 
resignation of president roh taewoo and protested the death of 
dissident student lee cholkyu whom they claim was killed and 
tortured by police 
down with roh taewoo and bring back lee cholkyu 
students shouted 
the campus protests were peaceful except at sogang university 
where about 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks 
at least six people were hurt police said 
hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police in 
the southern city of kwangju lees body was found in a reservoir 
near that city may 10 
a government report concluded lee slipped and fell into the 
reservoir after fleeing a police roadblock the report said there 
was no evidence lee was tortured or that police were involved in 
his death 
student leaders said hundreds of students today joined the 
hunger protest at the cathedral demanding the government admit 
police killed lee about 300 students began the hunger strike last 
thursday but their number dwindled to 60 by tuesday student 
leaders said about 500 students were now taking part in the hunger 
strike but there was no way to confirm the figure 
doctors aiding the students said eight hunger strikers were 
hospitalized after collapsing and that scores gave up fasting 
because of weakness 
riot police blocked the hunger strikers and about 300 protesters 
when they tried to march from the cathedral in a candlelight 
parade lines of police stopped the march but there was no 
violence 
some radical student groups have called for peaceful protests 
after six riot troopers were killed may 3 in a campus 
demonstration the deaths outraged public opinion in south korea 
the south korean radicals lack broad public support because of 
their violent tactics and extreme views 
students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics 
as those used by prodemocracy chinese students in beijing 
in a related development news reports today said south korea 
will import spray guns that shoot tear gas mixed with water to 
replace controversial rifles that shoot tear gas canisters about 
230 guns will be imported from israel to combat the violent 
protests according to the daily chosun ilbo 
police will also import water cannons from austria the 
newspaper said police refused comment on the reports 
there has been public outcry against police for using the rifles 
and armored vans carrying multiple tear gas launchers the straight 
tear gas has caused injuries and some deaths

rep robert davis says his hiring of his 
girlfriend for a 28000 a year job on the house merchant marine 
and fisheries committee is ethically sound 
davis 56 rmich acknowledged tuesday he has been living with 
the 28yearold staffer brook ball since earlier this year miss 
ball was hired jan 1 on davis recommendation and he moved into 
her virginia apartment in late january or early february shortly 
after separating from his wife marty davis 
we checked with the ethics committee before we hired her to 
make sure there was nothing wrong with doing it davis said 
the answer was very clearly there is nothing wrong with it 
disclosure of the relationship between davis and miss ball 
prompted a flurry of accusations between the congressman and his 
wife of 12 years the congressman has filed for divorce and he and 
mrs davis have been sparring in court over how much support he 
should be required to pay 
davis accused his estranged wife of leaking the information to 
reporters in an effort to get more alimony in the divorce 
proceedings 
she has threatened me on numerous occasions saying if i 
dont get what i want in the way of alimony im going to go public 
with it 
mrs davis however denied she was the source of the 
information and said she had never threatened the congressman or 
his staff 
all i did was just warn them to try to keep him in check

kaohsiung in the south stretched about 240 miles over highways and 
city streets and was broken only at intersections to allow traffic

history but they are not alone in shouldering their duties because 
we are firmly behind them ko chienwei a student leader at

michigans supreme court today refused a 
speededup ruling on the constitutionality of a voterapproved ban 
on statefunded abortions for the poor 
the high court declined to bypass the michigan court of appeals 
and take up the issue first saying it was unconvinced the question 
needed to be handled so quickly 
the michigan chapter of the american civil liberties union had 
appealed directly to the supreme court a decision by wayne county 
circuit judge john h hausner upholding the ban which was approved 
by the voters in november 
the aclu acted on behalf of a 15yearold girl from detroit who 
became pregnant as a result of a gang rape the girls family had 
challenged the cutoff of about 6 million a year for some 18000 
medicaid abortions 
the girl obtained an abortion privately after hausner upheld the

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the may 26 
the morning news tribune tacoma wash on high school dropouts 
west virginia not generally considered to be a state at the 
forefront of bold educational experiments has worked a minor 
miracle its come up with a way to cut its high school dropout 
rate by almost a third 
the state has cut its annual dropout figure from 5000 to 3400 
by threatening dropouts with loss of the most valuable commodity in 
their young lives their drivers license 
under a law enacted last year a student who drops out at 16 
loses his license and doesnt become eligible to get it again until 
18 students with special situations have the right to appeal the 
decision but the state has not granted many exemptions 
of course its approach to cutting the dropout rate would not 
work in every community or with every student many lowincome and 
urban students dont drive so threatening them with loss of their 
license wouldnt mean much 
but for many teenagers the thought of losing their drivers 
license just might be enough to convince them to hang in there 
another year or two and finish high school with an estimated one 
out of four students failing to graduate in the united states 
heres a new idea with a real impact

the westerly ri sun on overweight americans 
americans are changing the way they manage their own bodies but 
they are still getting fatter every year 
at a time when the public has more information than ever before 
about health and fitness about what foods are healthful the 
increase in the percentage of overweight americans is alarming and 
disappointing 
polster louis harris pointed out that twothirds of americans 
weigh more than their height and body type justify and twothirds 
said they dont exercise strenuously 
junk food continues its popularity and exercise while gaining 
in visibility has not worked its way into the daily routines of 
enough americans 
its time for a federal initiative similar to president 
kennedys presidents council on physical fitness something to 
inspire all of us to keep fit and stay healthy

heralddispatch huntington wva on the safety of older 
planes 
three cheers for the federal aviation administration which has 
taken an important step toward making flying safer 
until now faa policy has been to regularly inspect airliners 
looking for signs of cracks corrosion or metal fatigue when 
problems were found parts were ordered replaced 
last years aloha airlines accident tragically illustrated the 
inadequacy of that policy the aircraft involved an older boeing 
737 passed its inspection but later in flight over the pacific 
the top third of the aircraft peeled away a flight attendant died 
when she was sucked out of the plane and 61 of the 94 other people 
on board were injured before the pilots safely landed the aircraft 
on the island of maui 
since the aloha incident the faa has reexamined its safety 
policies for older aircraft and its now decided to order many 
parts replaced at a certain age regardless of their condition 
the faa says the new policy will cost the airlines more than 
140 million over the next few years but that will be a cheap 
price to pay if it makes the skylanes safer

democrats cant forget that gingrich relentlessly pursued house

the record hackensack nj on james bakers middle east 
speech 
secretary of state james a baker iii had a remarkably 
nononsense warning for israel give up the dream of annexing the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip and reach out to palestinians 
as neighbors who deserve political rights 
for palestinians and the arab world baker had a plea to let 
israel live in peace and security and to respond constructively to 
israeli proposals for elections in the occupied territories 
to some friends of israel this goodneighbor policy sounds 
naive and dangerous 
yet israel cannot afford a conflict with palestinians in the 
occupied territories that lasts forever 
the struggle is dividing israel diverting resource from other 
problems and souring world opinion 
criticism of israel and the kind of balance baker showed in his 
speech do not mean any lessening of americas commitment to israel 
what it does mean is a change from the style of the reagan 
years when a speech as bluntly critical as bakers would have been 
out of the question

the fresno calif bee on rep tony coelhos surprise 
resignation 
once the shock wore off the decision of rep tony coelho 
dcalif to resign from congress six months into his sixth term 
made sense 
there are still unanswered questions as to timing and motives 
but we have his statement that he would not put his party his 
colleagues and his family through a continuing barrage of questions 
about his ethics 
as the thirdranking democrat in the house he was certain to be 
republican target no 1 after the expected resignation of speaker 
jim wright 
but what coelho called the predictable turmoil was only part 
of it for all of his fierce attachment to the political life he 
is not a time server 
he is both ambitious and fatalistic when he saw a lid possibly 
coming down on his chances to move up in the house hierarchy and 
even a prospect that he might have to fight for his present 
position as democratic whip he had no yen to hang on 
we do not share coelhos apparent conviction that hes being 
besieged simply because of an overheated climate of ethical 
scrutiny his problem with an investment in highyield highrisk 
bonds in which he received financial help from a savings and loan 
executive cant just be ascribed to a mistake or a simple 
failure to accurately report details of the transaction 
a reporting glitch aside the deal itself was unsettling 
putting aside the circumstances of his leavetaking his 
effectiveness as a representative is beyond challenge

with his power as speaker of the house of representatives fast 
eroding jim wright is sensibly weighing resignation from his 
leadership role 
although the house ethics committee has not yet rendered a 
verdict on the 69 allegations of ethical misconduct against wright 
the speaker belatedly has recognized his futile position 
holding any of the top offices within the hierarchy of congress 
requires not just electoral longevity awarded by the voters back 
home but institutional fealty awarded by the membership on 
capitol hill 
now that wrights yearslong pattern of shady scheming has been 
revealed the reputation of the entire house has been sullied by 
implication wright has sacrificed the political prerequisite of 
leadership in congress its majoritys allegiance 
painful as it has been the wright episode will have served a 
useful purpose if it prompts congress out of fear if not out of 
selfdiscipline to uphold higher standards of conduct

the evening sun baltimore on health care for the aging 
a new report from the us house committee on aging offers a 
sobering view of the nations already embattled healthcare system 
according to the report two trends are currently at work in 
america today that will collide early in the 21st century the 
population is aging and the percentage of caregivers is dropping 
if doesnt take a demographer to realize that if these trends 
continue unabated there simply will not be enough nurses and home 
health care workers one piece of the equation is unchangeable 
the elderly will make up a larger and larger share of the 
population 
thanks in large part to the demographic glitch caused by the 
babyboom generation the number of senior citizens will swell from 
the current 291 million 118 percent of the population to 545 
million 177 percent of the population by 2020 
and the elderly typically suffer from more chronic illness need 
more athome care and spend more days in the hospital than the 
overall population 
meanwhile nursing shortages in hospitals nationwide have more 
than doubled in the last five years more than half of all home 
healthcare agencies report difficulties in finding and recruiting 
healthcare professionals and the shortfall is predicted to 
continue 
the statistics warn of a healthcare crisis fortunately 
though it can be averted through proper planning

the sun herald biloxi miss on pollution 
a survey shows that americans are aware of the rapid increase 
in the pollution of our environment and they want goverment to take 
urgent action to halt it 
the message hasnt yet been understood by the politicians and 
the bureaucrats who have been charged with protecting the 
environment public support for cleanups has been greatly 
underestimated 
the survey undertaken by media general and the associated 
press clearly demonstrated that the public is not blind to whats 
happening and not unconcerned 
it is no suprise that the people polled were aware of whats 
happening the media have been documenting the problems 
what is encouraging is that the survey shows just how willing 
people are to support efforts to halt the pollution even with 
measures that would be inconvenient and costly to them

world got a glimpse of the future and it looked encouraging 
young chinese welleducated and more worldly wise than their 
parents are demanding that their lives have meaning in a nation 
which has place almost no value on the individual this is radical 
behavior 
it appears that the entrenched party members in both china and

responsibility for safety at the nations 16 weapons plants 
he has also eliminated any safety oversight and monitoring at 
the plants by another office within his department 
production schedules and proper safety procedures are both 
important components in the weapons production program but the two

cure legislation proposed by the bush administration would change 
that offering the business sector reason to become an ally instead

the bush plan focuses on setting sulfur emissions limits and 
then allowing polluters to choose the most costeffective way to 
comply 
the strategy offers welcome innovation to resolving an enduring 
problem whose most accessible solutions have been undertaken 
already 
the nation has made remarkable progress in reducing air

small economysized vehicles that offered high gasoline mileage 
as gas prices decreased however americans traded their economy 
cars for new models that offered greater comfort and increased 
performance yet demanded more fuel 
already theres pressure aplenty to increase auto fuel 
efficiency 
these suggestions play into concerns of us foreign

the albuquerque nm tribune on ending unfair trade 
no one who understands the benefits of an open world trading 
system can be pleased by president bushs designation last week of 
japan india and brazil as unfair trading nations but he had no 
good alternative to that risky action 
bush acted under a stiff provision of the 1988 trade law which 
requires him to name nations that maintain barriers to us 
exports if negotiations do not remove the barriers the president 
is authorized to retaliate 
if bush had not moved against japan which richly deserves to be 
called an unfair trader congress would have exploded with fury and 
might well have passed protectionist legislation that would have 
done even more harm 
japan which ran a 55 billion trade surplus with the united 
states last year was the main target but bush did not want to 
cite it alone fearing an irrational reaction by tokyo so brazil 
and india less flagrant offenders were added as cover 
japan has to change it cannot expect to sell cars and consumer 
electronics to americans and refuse to buy what they make best 
one hopes americans will have the patience and japanese will 
develop the maturity to prevent a titfortat trade war that will 
harm everybody

the super bowl isnt coming to indianapolis in 1992 it will go 
instead to minneapolis maybe thats a shame but all the same its 
hard not to breathe a sigh of relief 
indianapolis after all had offered to fork over about 35 
million worth of incentives to the nfl more than 1 million of 
that would have come directly from the pockets of taxpayers 
yes the super bowl is a prestigious event and yes bringing it 
to indianapolis would probably have enhanced the reputation of the 
city 
but youve got to wonder where they come up with these 
economic impact statements word from city officials was that 
the super bowl would have an economic impact of 100 million on 
whatever city was chosen 
what does that mean where do such figures come from 
indianapolis would do well in the future to avoid such giant 
offers of tax money to lure events like the super bowl here 
this proud city may be eager for the action that major sports 
events bring but it also has other more important priorities for 
the peoples precious tax money

an official appointed to draft an 
integration plan for louisianas public colleges recommended 
eliminating most openadmissions policies and putting all 17 
schools under a single governing board 
no universities would be closed or merged under the proposal 
issued tuesday by paul verkuil 
verkuil appointed by a federal panel to come up with a 
desegregation plan for the 145000student system changed few 
details from a preliminary proposal issued april 18 said john 
kennedy legal aide to gov buddy roemer 
the court will have the final say on the plan 
the 17member board would be appointed by the governor and 
approved by the senate and would govern all public higher education 
in louisiana replacing four boards that run the 13 fouryear 
institutions and four twoyear schools 
verkuil said the board would be responsible for insuring that 
progress toward eliminating louisianas racially dual education 
system is achieved 
verkuil was appointed after the court ruled last year that a 
1981 desegregation agreement between the state and the us justice 
department had failed the plan had called for spending millions of 
dollars to improve predominantly black southern and grambling state 
universities 
the dispute began 15 years ago when the justice department 
accused the state of running a dual system of higher education for 
blacks and whites 
under the plan recommended by verkuil president of william and 
mary college in virginia louisiana state university would become 
the states flagship institution with the toughest admission 
standards 
a second and third tier of fouryear schools with less stringent 
standards would be set up while twoyear community colleges would 
continue to offer open admissions and would be responsible for most 
remedial courses 
the more stringent admissions policies are part of the plans 
larger goal of improving the quality of higher education in 
louisiana 
currently all louisiana colleges admit all graduates of 
louisiana high schools fiftyfour percent of entering freshmen 
must take remedial courses 
kennedy said he did not know if the judges would hear further 
comment from the parties in the case including southern 
university the us justice department and the grmbling alumni 
before deciding whether to approve the plan 
kennedy said roemer who had pushed for a single board was 
pleased by verkuils recommendation the single board is the 
linchpin of this whole thing he said 
state sen william jefferson an attorney for southern said he 
had not seen the recommendation and declined to comment 
other parties were not available for immediate comment black 
leaders had said a unified board would be insensitive to the needs 
of southern university and grambling 
some proposals for eliminating racial disparities in the state 
system included closing some predominantly black institutions

here are excerpts from boris n yeltsins speech 
wednesday to the congress of peoples deputies as translated by 
the associated press 
on devolution of power 
at the congress the most important question is being decided on 
which the future of our society depends the question of power 
which by rights must belong to the people in the form of the organ 
it elects that is the congress of peoples deputies the central 
committee plenum just before the congress opened did not support my 
suggestion to transfer power somehow at this very first congress 
from the party to the soviets local parliaments the plenum 
decided to recommend for leading posts the same people who have not 
managed to get the society out of crises in politics the economy 
finances the standard of living 
on limited powers of the congress 
the congress which had to take into its hands the power for 
perestroika and the transformation of society has ended up as 
hostage to laws and decisions taken by the previous supreme soviet 
formed back in the times of stagnation 
important questions of state power and administration which 
logically should have been reviewed by the congress were 
decided in advance and it is proposed that we vote in favor of 
these laws 
in these conditions there is a danger of the supreme soviet and 
its presidium turning into an apparatus or lets say half an 
apparatus under the president 
the state of the nation 
the situation in the country is extremely alarming 
antiperestroika forces have become active and are consolidating 
the shadow economy is growing corruption and crime are on the 
rise the moral standards of society are becoming diluted the 
problems of youth are getting sharper the principles of social 
justice and social equality are not being realized the number of 
poor people is growing the soviet peoples belief in the real 
results of perestroika is falling the contradictions in ethnic 
problems are getting sharper the decisions on the food problem 
are being delayed 
the disorganization of the internal market inflation queues 
ration coupons the threat of a financial collapse has become real 
the commandadministrative system has not been broken power still 
belongs to the party apparatus and the bureaucracy 
the vast system of power is profitable only for this apparatus 
the promised program and the promises of the last four years 
have not been fulfilled people live worse such political 
evaluations of the current moment and some of the selfcriticism in 
the speech of comrade gorbachev do not remove him in my opinion 
from responsibility for all of that 
on troops attacking protesters in tbilisi 
a year after the party conference supporting the course for 
democratization we have hit out at meetings and demonstrations 
with one decree at glasnost with a second with a third we 
approved the use of special forces against our own people 
exactly in this atmosphere of creating extraordinary bans by 
law and especially recently such crimes as in tbilisi became 
possible i was there and i am convinced that it was a crime a 
crime against our own people 
in order to calm people down a bit it is necessary to say at 
the congress who in the center took the decision since the 
leadership knows this 
on glasnost 
to guarantee broader democratization and glasnost lets not 
hamper their development as is already happening in fact a law 
on the press should be adopted and the mass media should not 
be organs of the party they should become more and more 
independent 
on priorities 
first of all it is necessary to consider at the congress of 
peoples deputies the tasks and goals of the society and taking 
them into account to form a commission to work on a draft of a new 
constitution i consider it one of the tasks to decisively 
decentralize power and economy to dismantle the 
commandadministrative system which is the source of the menace 
that we would return to the past 
on social justice and the privileged nomenklatura 
without delay laws on pensions on poverty on ecology and on 
forms of property should be adopted in the existing circumstances 
the congress should first of all adopt state programs on how to 
take the country out of crisis the program should be a program of 
urgent measures for more than 70 years we have not managed to 
solve the question of social justice theres every reason to speak 
of an elite existing in our society which is building socialism 
why are there tens of millions of people in this country who live 
below all possible levels of poverty while others bask in luxury 
the defense of the less welltodo and the defenseless layers of 
society should be made a principle of socialist justice 
to begin with taking into account the deficit maybe we should 
cancel all unlawful principles for the nomenklatura and in 
general remove from our lexicon this word nomenklatura this 
would raise the moral level of our society it is necessary to fix 
a minimum standard of living and already at this congress we 
should decide at least one concrete social issue otherwise people 
wont understand us for example we should create a free supply of 
medicines free public transport for the disabled and those below 
the poverty line to solve the pension question at least in part 
i hand over to the presidium of the congress a legislative 
initiative drafted and signed by a large group of deputies 
before we solve all issues of medical care it is necessary to 
transform the fourth medical department the special department 
that provides medical care for the elite into a department caring 
for mothers and their children this should be done for the sake of 
our future in order not to have a situation where infant mortality 
is twice that of any civilized country 
about president mikhail s gorbachev 
i cannot help voicing here one of my concerns the congress 
constitution and the party entrusted the head of state with 
extremely broad authority here we can perceive a troubling 
tendency against the background of a deteriorating economy and the 
sharpening of social issues we see an increase of personal 
influence and personal power in the hands of the head of state 
this can lead to the temptation to solve our complex problems with 
force and we can again find ourselves in the sway of a new 
authoritarian regime a new dictatorship without noticing it 
moreover for 70 years we have not accumulated experience 
either through the party parliament or people of controlling the 
activity of the head of state i think within the limits of 
building a state based on law the present congress should create 
certain collective mechanisms as one of the elements of such a 
mechanism i suggest adopting a law on an annual referendum on 
peoples confidence in the chairman of the supreme soviet of the 
ussr the president

congress today increased benefits 
for workers and retirees and allotted money for a food distribution 
plan in an effort to end looting and riots that have killed 11

aires suburbs and the city of rosario the nations thirdlargest 
rioting also occurred in the cities of mendoza la plata and 
tucuman 
shops and offices opened today in buenos aires 
the food riots have increased pressure on alfonsin to step down 
before his sixyear term ends dec 10 and the countrys largest 
labor coalition and most influential business group on tuesday 
asked menem to take office early 
the economic crisis has been caused by argentinas 59 billion 
foreign debt a national budget deficit worsened by inefficient 
state companies and months of inflation that could top 70 percent 
for may 
the inflation has led to layoffs food and supply shortages and 
declining real wages that have left retirees living on the 
equivalent of 25 a month 
the country is dying of hunger factories are closing people 
are unemployed adolfo perez esquivel head of the human rights 
group peace and justice service and the 1980 nobel peace prize

will rise to about 36 and the minimum for widows to about 33 the

with menem on terms of the transition 
asked tuesday whether he favored an early transition menem 
said that would not be opportune in these grave moments the 
country is going through 
alfonsins election in 1983 ended nearly eight years of military 
dictatorship 
the government has blamed ultraleftist groups for the riots 
but has offered little proof vice president victor martinez blamed 
groups that do not want to see the current government end its 
term and another constitutional government begin 
the latest deaths occurred tuesday in the buenos aires suburbs 
of san miguel and quilmes during a riot in which looters broke 
windows and emptied shelves in furniture stores bars sports and

jimmy connors battled in the sun for almost 4 
hours but ran out of stamina and was beaten 46 63 75 75 by 
fellow american jay berger in the second round of the mens singles 
at the french open today 
the tenacious connors the no9 seed and possibly making his 
last appearance at the french open at age 36 was cheered on by a 
packed excited center court crowd he tried everything he knew to 
fight off berger and stay in the one grand slam event he never has 
won 
but berger the worlds 28thranked player enjoying a season 
that has reaped victories over boris becker and mats wilander used 
his superior fitness to wear down the streetfighting connors after 
4 hours 26 minutes of energysapping baseline tennis 
i practiced with jimmy and got to know him really well i 
respected him more than other player in the game berger said 
this is just a great win for me after losing three times to him 
it was such a battle im so drained right now i can barely talk 
connors said he nothing to be ashamed of after putting on a 
typically neversaydie performance 
all i can do is go out and fight till death it was not 
exactly like a walk in the park i could have played a fifth set 
my mouthpiece wasnt knocked out he said 
connors began in typical fashion rallying from a 41 deficit to 
win five straight games and take the opening set 
but once berger had squared the match the veteran connors had a 
fight on his hands against an opponent 14 years younger berger 
broke him to take a 65 lead in the third set and connors task

foreign minister sousuke uno chosen wednesday by 
governing party leaders to be the next prime minister and lead the 
government from unprecedented crisis is seen as an experienced but 
weak politician 
uno was the second choice of the liberal democratic party to 
succeed prime minister noboru takeshita party leaders tried to 
persuade the partys executive council chairman masayoshi ito 75 
to take the job but he refused citing poor health and 
dissatisfaction with the partys handling of reforms 
few leaders within the scandalridden liberal democratic party 
sang the praises of the 66yearold uno and many put forward 
lastminute alternatives to his nomination such as collective 
rather than individual leadership 
many fear he cannot win back public confidence in the 
government shaken by an influencepeddling scandal that forced 
takeshita to step down and led to charges against 17 politicians 
bureaucrats and businessmen 
analysts speculated that party bosses who are too tainted by 
the financial scandal to take the post now settled on uno as an 
interim leader who will allow them to exert influence and not upset 
their future aspirations 
even the conservative yomiuri shimbun japans largest 
newspaper described uno who has been foreign minister since 1987 
as only a reasonable choice 
some party leaders would have preferred that the successor to 
prime minister takeshita come from the junior ranks in order to 
revitalize the party but uno was chosen to maintain party 
harmony yomiuri said in an editorial 
former prime ministers zenko suzuki and takeo fukuda suggested a 
group leadership and expressed fears uno may be too weak to steer 
the conservative party to victory in parliamentary elections this 
summer 
support for the liberal democrats has fallen to the lowest 
levels ever largely because of the scandal in which the recruit 
co a publishing conglomerate allegedly won government favors by 
handing out millions of dollars in political donations and 
underpriced stock 
though uno is untainted by the scandal he is closely allied 
with former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone under whose 198287 
tenure the influencepeddling allegedly occurred 
the proximity of the two has damaged unos reputation and it 
almost cost him the party nomination analysts say on sunday 
nakasone resigned from the party partly to relieve pressure on uno 
but supporters say unos highranking cabinet posts in a country 
striving for a stronger international role have made him a familiar 
figure to the japanese public and that in itself will bring votes 
to the party 
uno has headed the ministry of international trade and industry 
the defense agency and the science and technology agency he is a 
10term member of the lower house of parliament from shiga 
prefecture in western japan 
born aug 27 1922 into a wealthy family in shiga uno fought 
in world war ii and served on the asian mainland before being taken 
prisoner by soviet troops in northern korea he and his wife 
chiyo have two children a son and daughter

our proposal has several key initiatives i propose that we lock 
the eastern agreement to westernproposed ceilings on tanks and 
armored troop carriers we should also seek an agreement on common 
numerical ceilings for artillery the range between natos and that 
of the warsaw pact provided these definitional problems can be 
solved and the weapons we remove must be destroyed 
we should expand our current offer to include all landbased 
combat aircraft and helicopters by proposing that both sides reduce 
in these categories to a level 15 percent below the current nato 
totals 
given the warsaw pacts advantage in numbers the pact would 
have to make far deeper reductions than nato to establish parity at 
those lower levels again the weapons we remove must be destroyed 
i propose a 20percent cut in combat manpower in usstationed 
forces and a resulting ceiling on us and soviet ground and air 
forces stationed outside of national territory in the 
atlantictotheurals zone at approximately 275000 each this 
reduction to parity a fair and balanced level of strength would 
compel the soviets to reduce their 600000strong red army in 
eastern europe by 325000 and these withdrawn forces must be 
demobilized 
finally i call on soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to 
accelerate the timetable for reaching these agreements there is no 
reason why the fiveto sixyear timetable as suggested by moscow 
is necessary 
i propose a much more ambitious schedule and we should aim to 
reach an agreement within six months to a year and accomplish 
reductions by 1992 or 1993 at the latest 
in addition to my conventional arms proposals i believe that we 
ought to strive to improve the openness with which we and the 
soviets conduct our military activities and therefore i want to 
reiterate my support for greater transparency i renew my proposal 
that the soviet union and its allies open their skies to reciprocal 
unarmed aerial surveillance flights conducted on short notice to 
watch military activity 
satellites are a very important way to verify arms control 
agreements but they do not provide constant coverage of the soviet 
union an open skies policy would move both sides closer to a total 
continuity of coverage while symbolizing greater openness between 
east and west 
these are my proposals to achieve a less militarized europe 
a short time ago they would have been considered too 
revolutionary to consider and yet today we may well be on the 
verge of a more ambitious agreement than europe than anyone 
considered possible but were also by challenged developments 
outside of natos traditional areas of concern 
every western nation still faces the global proliferation of 
lethal technologies including ballistic missiles and chemical 
weapons we must collectively control the spread of these growing 
threats so we should begin as soon as possible with a worldwide 
ban on chemical weapons 
growing political freedom in the east a berlin without 
barriers a cleaner environment a less militarized europe each is 
a noble goal and taken together they are the foundation of our 
larger vision a europe that is free and at peace with itself 
so let the soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their 
legitimate security interests our goal is to convince them step 
by step that their definition of security is obsolete that their 
deepest fears are unfounded 
when western europe takes its giant step in 1992 it will 
institutionalize whats been true for years borders open to 
people commerce and ideas no shadow of suspicion no sinister 
fear is passed between you the very prospect of war within the 
west is unthinkable to our citizens 
but such a peaceful integration of nations into a world 
community does not mean that any nation must relinquish its 
culture much less its sovereignty 
this process of integration a subtle weaving of shared 
interests which is so nearly complete in western europe has now 
finally begun in the east we want to help the nations of eastern 
europe realize what we the nations of western europe learned long 
ago the foundation of lasting security comes not from tanks 
troops or barbed wire it is built on shared values and agreements 
that link free peoples 
the nations of eastern europe are rediscovering the glories of 
their national heritage so let the colors and hues of national 
culture return to these gray societies of the east let europe 
forego a peace of tension for a peace of trust one in which the 
peoples of the east and west can rejoice a continent that is 
diverse yet whole 
forty years of cold war have tested western resolve and the 
strength of our values natos first mission is now nearly 
complete but if we are to fulfill our vision our european vision 
the challenges of the next 40 years will ask no less of us 
together we shall answer the call the world has waited long 
enough 
thank you for inviting me to mainz may god bless you all 
long live the friendship between germany and the united states 
thank you and god bless you

israeli troops today shot and killed three 
guerrillas on the border with lebanon the army command said it 
was the third attempted infiltration in four days 
also today police in lebanon said israeli warplanes attacked 
targets on the outskirts of the southern city of sidon in the fifth 
such attack this year there were no details on casualties 
soldiers shot and killed a 20yearold palestinian in a clash in 
the gaza town of khan yunis and wounded eight other palestinians in 
clashes in the occupied west bank and gaza strip arab doctors said 
and israeli news reports said police had detained six jewish 
settlers suspected of killing a 13yearold arab girl during a 
rampage through a west bank village 
the army said two palestinians from gaza died of wounds suffered 
in earlier clashes it was checking the arab reports of todays 
casualties in the occupied territories 
the border incident occurred near the lebanese village of hula 
about a mile west of the israeli town of kiryat shemona said a 
military spokesman 
he said troops spotted the three guerrillas opened fire and 
killed them immediately the spokesman who cannot be identified 
according to army regulations said the israelis suffered no 
casualties 
security sources said the area has been the site of increased 
troop activity in recent days and reporters observed flares there 
on tuesday a guerrilla was shot to death in southern lebanon 
after being spotted by israeli troops and their south lebanese 
militia allies east of the lebanese town of marjayoun 
troops also killed two guerrillas sunday after several rockets 
were fired into the israeli border town of metulla two more 
guerillas were captured and two escaped the army said 
sundays raid was claimed by george habashs popular front for 
the liberation of palestine and the late talaat yacoubs 
damascusbased palestine liberation front 
arab doctors did not identify the palestinian reported shot and 
killed today the other two palestinians who died of wounds 
suffered earlier 14 were identified by arab news reports as ahmed 
ibrahim nawas 18 who was shot tuesday and mohammed ali al 
farajani 15 wounded may 14 both were shot in the head 
the deaths raised to 502 the number of palestinians killed in 
the nearly 18month uprising against israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip twentytwo israelis have also been killed 
 
the army meanwhile has started using a new bullet against 
palestinian demonstrators in the occupied lands to help reduce 
fatalities caused by plastic bullets the israeli daily maariv 
reported 
the newspaper said the socalled stun bullet is designed not 
to penetrate the body but it quoted unidentified army commanders 
as saying the bullet can kill if fired improperly it said two 
deaths have been attributed to the new bullet 
the newspaper did not provide further details an army spokesman 
declined immediate comment 
according to army figures 77 palestinians have been killed by 
plastic bullets since they were introduced 10 months ago in some 
cases because the bullets were fired contrary to regulations 
also today palestinians throughout the occupied lands observed 
a general strike ordered by moslem fundamentalists to protest what 
they called prime minister yitzhak shamirs curse against the 
prophet mohammed 
the strike referred to a newspaper interview in which shamir 
warned israel must not make territorial concessions to the 
palestinians because someone might try to cheat us to lie to 
us 
someone might say lets cheat the israelis just like 
mohammed did the palestinians always bring these examples of how 
mohammed used all sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents 
shamir told the jerusalem post in an interview published earlier 
this month 
police meanwhile detained six jewish settlers accused of 
killing a palestinian girl and wounding two others in a rampage 
monday in the west bank village of kifil harith 
the suspects were identified as seminarians at josephs tomb 
yeshiva in nablus 12 miles away 
the hadashot daily said the six would be brought before a judge 
and charged within a few days

the world health organization marked its second 
notobacco day on wednesday and its leader said he was alarmed at 
the rising number of women smokers worldwide 
some countries also marked the day during which smokers were 
urged to give up cigarettes and chewing tobacco for 24 hours the 
theme of this years event was the female smoker at added risk 
antismokers in bangladesh announced the results of a smoking 
survey and soviet scientists appealed to women to quit smoking 
delegates to the congress of peoples deputies in moscow agreed to 
an appeal by one deputy to refrain from smoking inside the palace 
of congresses for the day 
dr hiroshi nakajima who directorgeneral said smoking posed 
greater health risks to women than to men and urged women not to 
seek a false expression of liberty through cigarettes 
women who take birthcontrol pills face increased risks of heart 
disease and strokes and pregnant women endanger the lives of their 
children he said at a news conference in geneva 
the death rate of women from lung cancer has risen by at least 
200 percent since the 1950s and more than 500000 women die each 
year as a result of smoking according to who figures 
the number of women who smoke increased markedly and became a 
concern after world war ii 
it is deplorable that while tobacco consumption by men is 
clearly decreasing in certain countries women are becoming the 
principle target of tobacco advertising nakajima said 
women are smoking more in a false expression of liberty 
equality and intellectual prestige unfortunately advertising is 
stimulating this tendency he said 
the un agency singled out for particular criticism cigarette 
brands aimed exclusively at women and promoted by images and words 
that imply glamour such as ultraslim or slender 
but nakajima ruled out an international agreement to regulate 
tobacco marketing similar to the one already adopted by the agency 
for baby formula 
he said such an agreement would be almost impossible because 
of opposition by many of whos 166 members including third world 
countries dependent on tobacco exports and industrialized countries 
that receive high tax revenues from tobacco 
nakajima said he was concerned about the trend in the third 
world where smoking is on the increase especially among educated 
women 
in a who survey of 40 countries the 10 with the highest female 
smoking rates were in the third world 
at the top of the list was papua new guinea where 80 percent of 
adult women smoke followed by swaziland in southern africa with 72 
percent according to the survey 
in bangladesh an antismoking group announced the results of a 
survey conducted in april that showed that about 5 million women in 
the country chew or smoke tobacco about 25 million people in the 
nation of 110 million smoke according to the group adhunik which 
means modern in the bengali language 
denmark where 39 percent of the women smoke topped the list of 
industrialized countries in whos survey followed by the 
netherlands with 33 percent the united states where 24 percent of 
the women smoke ranked 16th out of 25 industrialized countries 
who has called on doctors to help patients break the habit 
especially by setting an example themselves 
the agency estimates that 10 percent of us male doctors smoke 
an estimated 42 percent smoke in the soviet union 65 percent in 
the netherlands and 70 percent in poland 
the agency did not include female doctors in its figures 
who estimates that about 25 million people die each year as a 
result of smoking

police officers made an exploratory dive into 
the great miami river today a day after the body of the first 
victim of a bridge collapse was found snagged downriver in debris 
the officers were preparing for a search of the river thursday 
the first to be made since last week when storms caused a temporary 
bridge to collapse dropping at least two vehicles into the water 
three other victims are missing authorities believe the body 
of a woman was found about five miles from the bridge 
the rivers flow is still swift and hazardous to divers 
whitewater township fire chief bill darby said however the water 
level has dropped to about 10 feet down from the 23foot level 
when the bridge collapsed at rush hour friday evening 
meanwhile the firm that designed the bridge raised questions 
about its stability before it was built because the contractor was 
allowed to alter the plans a newspaper reported today 
elmer obermeyer jr managing partner of the cincinnati design 
firm of graham obermeyer and partners told the cincinnati enquirer 
his firm questioned the altered design at a meeting and in a letter 
to hamilton county engineer donald schramms office last year 
our design was heavier and had longer spans but nobody 
really envisioned that the collapse would happen obermeyer 
said 
schramm said he was aware of obermeyers concerns about the 
alternative design which cut the cost and time needed to build the 
temporary span but said the plans met the state department of 
transportations standards 
recovery teams used sonar tuesday to detect what appeared to be 
two vehicles on the river bottom near the bridge the currents 
remained too strong to allow divers into the water and officials 
said they probably wont send divers in before thursday 
authorities didnt release the identity of the woman whose body 
was found but they said she met the description of a missing 
person 
before the body was found police had received reports from 
relatives of four people missing according to frank weikel a 
spokesman for the hamilton county sheriffs department 
the temporary bridge opened dec 15 to carry traffic while a 
94yearold bridge is rebuilt a few feet away officials said the 
strong currents in the river which crested seven feet above flood 
stage over the weekend and the pounding from debris probably 
caused the collapse

riot police wielding truncheons 
arrested more than 600 radical students who tried to march to the 
roman catholic cathedral on wednesday to support antigovernment 
hunger strikers 
about 5000 troopers stopped 1000 students a few blocks from 
myongdong cathedral in the city center police charged into the 
column of protesters several times dragging away struggling 
students in a confrontation that lasted four hours 
although most protesters were peaceful some tried to ram 
through police lines to reach the cathedral where at least 60 
students are staging a hunger strike 
some riot police kicked and beat screaming demonstrators as they 
were hauled away police said there were injuries among the 
troopers and students but said they had no figures 
earlier 4000 students took part in rallies at 13 seoul 
colleges calling for the resignation of president roh taewoo 
they also want the government to admit responsibility in the 
death of radical student lee cholkyu who they say was tortured 
and killed by police a government report said lee died when he 
slipped into a reservoir while fleeing troopers and there was no 
evidence of police torture 
the students shouted down with roh taewoo and bring back 
lee cholkyu 
the campus protests were peaceful except at sogang university 
where 300 students battled police with firebombs and rocks at 
least six officers and students were hurt police said 
hundreds of students hurling rocks also clashed with police in 
southern kwangju near where lees body was found in a reservoir on 
may 10 
about 300 students began the hunger strike may 25 to demand the 
government admit that police killed lee but their number had 
dwindled to about 60 on tuesday student leaders said wednesday 
more students joined the strike and 500 were participating but 
there was no way to check that figure 
doctors said eight fasters were hospitalized after collapsing 
and scores began eating because of weakness 
on wednesday night riot police blocked the hunger strikers and 
about 300 protesters when they tried to march out of the cathedral 
for a candlelight parade lines of police stopped the march but 
there was no violence 
some radical students have called for peaceful protests after 
six riot troopers were killed may 3 in a campus demonstration the 
deaths outraged public opinion in south korea the radicals lack 
public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views 
students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics 
as those used by chinese students in the prodemocracy protest in 
beijing

democratic movement wednesday announced plans to become a

stolen art works could pour into the united 
states if a us art dealer wins a lawsuit over four sixth century 
christian mosaics an attorney for the cypriot government said 
if all it takes to bring stolen art into this country is an 
empty head and a roundtrip ticket to switzerland the flood gates 
are open thomas r kline said tuesday the first day of a 
lawsuit in federal court pitting a suburban art dealer against 
cyprus and its greek orthodox church 
kline said art dealer peg goldberg had tried to claim that her 
inexperience in the international art trade legitimized her 
purchase of the stolen mosaics which once graced the walls of a 
church in the northern village of lythrankomi 
this is a case about a woman who fell in love with a work of 
art said joe c emerson goldbergs attorney he added that his 
client had sought to determine if the mosaics were stolen before 
purchasing them 
analysts have said the case could set a precedent governing 
international trade in national art treasures 
the mosaics are the work of an unknown artist and depict jesus 
as a boy the apostles matthew and james and an archangel 
goldberg paid 12 million for the mosaics in july 1988 to aydin 
dikmen a turk living in west germany 
emerson said the cypriot government knew in 1982 that dikmen had 
been linked to art thefts from northern cyprus which is under 
turkish control and could have pursued him earlier to recover the 
mosaics 
athanasis papageorghiou acting director of cypriot antiquities 
testified tuesday that he knew of dikmen through news reports but 
had no way of stopping him 
during testimony today papageorghiou reviewed a list of 28 
people his department had notified about the missing mosaics in 
1980 the 28 from around the world were specialists in 
byzantine art and in all probability they could be contacted if 
something was for sale he said 
asked about efforts the cypriot government had made to recover 
the mosaics papageorghiou said he was told government officials 
had not contacted interpol because they needed the name and 
location of the smuggler 
papageorghiou said the removal of the mosaics was part of a 
widespread pattern of looting in churches in northern cyprus which 
since 1975 has been controlled by the selfdesignated turkish 
republic of northern cyprus 
many churches are looted museums are looted private 
collections are looted we have suffered much papageorghiou said 
he testified that the government was informed the mosaics were 
missing in november 1979 and had notified the united nations 
museums and other organizations 
judge james e noland ruled that the turkish cypriots could not 
intervene in the case because their government was not recognized 
by the united states 
the case could rest on whether cyprus diligently sought the 
return of the mosaics and whether or not goldberg showed good 
faith in trying to determine if the works were stolen 
also important was whether the sale would be governed by swiss 
law or more stringent indiana laws regarding stolen property 
kline said evidence would show the sale was finalized in west 
germany he said indiana law should apply because four indiana 
residents stand to profit from the sale of the mosaics an indiana 
bank authorized the loan for the sale and the mosaics were in 
switzerland only a few days en route to their final destination 
goldberg has said she checked a stolen art registry in new york 
unesco officials in switzerland and customs officials in the united 
states turkey switzerland and turkish cyprus before buying the 
mosaics 
she does not recall the name of a single official to whom she 
spoke kline said she never called cyprus or the church of 
cyprus miss goldberg does appear to be in quite a hurry in this 
transaction

the state department today ordered the 
explusion of two nicaraguan diplomats in retaliation for the ouster 
of two us envoys from managua last week 
the nicaraguan embassy was informed that the presence of roberto 
vargas and william vigil both minister counselors was no longer 
acceptable to the government of the united states department 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
they were given 72 hours to leave the country 
last thursday the sandinista government expelled joel cassman 
economics officer at the us embassy in managua and kathleen 
barmon a regional labor attache from the embassy in honduras who 
was on a visit to managua they were accused of inciting nicaraguan 
school teachers to join a wildcat strike 
boucher said the state department waited six days before 
expelling the two nicaraguans in hopes that the sandinista 
government would reverse its unwarranted unjustified expulsion 
of the two americans 
he said the nicaraguan government chose not to reconsider its 
decision and the state department reciprocated by expelling vargas 
and vigil 
nicaraguan embassy spokeswoman cecilia lopez said the two envoys 
had arrived in washington just 10 days ago she had no further

the nato allies have patched up an 
unsettling quarrel over shortrange missiles and president bush has 
come to west germany and declared us friendship with the germans 
the two events have lifted chancellor helmut kohl out of the 
political doldrums and given west germans a feeling of pride and 
emerging prominence and in two weeks kohl will be welcoming 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union for a summit 
it is a dramatic change 
only a few days ago west germans were in a quandary about the 
corner theyd painted themselves into challenging nato policy and 
the united states by insisting on negotiations to remove 
shortrange nuclear missiles from europe 
but the nato summit in brussels produced an compromise agreement 
and allowed bush and kohl to conduct their twoday summit like best 
friends 
the relationship between the united states and the federal 
republic of germany has never been better bush said repeatedly 
during his visit 
the leaders referred often to the first years after world war 
ii stoking the emotional embers still burning in many older west 
germans who recall the american role in rebuilding their nation 
after the fall of hitlers third reich 
the nostalgic theme struck the chord it intended compounding 
west germans satisfaction over the brussels success with a 
reassurance that the americans are still on their side 
bushs visit was a time of celebration for west germans who are 
at once pleased to have made their point with nato partners and 
relieved that it didnt cost them any standing with the alliance 
while many west germans are opposed to nuclear weapons in their 
country they are fearful of isolation and vulnerability should 
they stray too far from their traditional allies 
no nukes no troops is the warning one senior us official 
says he has delivered to west german authorities it raised the 
possibility that if the battlefield nuclear weapons are removed the 
thousands of american and british soldiers in west germany would 
soon follow 
the nato compromise seemed to blow away the concern and it was 
all smiles at the highprofile presidential visit 
larger than expected crowds of wellwishers turned out to greet 
bush and his wife barbara at their public appearances carried 
live on nationwide television the presidents announcement that 
west germans would no longer need visas to visit the united states 
drew thunderous cheers 
a gift from bush for all germans the bild newspaper gushed 
in a banner headline referring to the visa announcement it 
forecast a rosy arms control future declaring now peace is 
really taking off 
west germans who often seem insecure about their standing in 
the world appeared to be relishing the international prestige 
bestowed on them by bushs visit and their role in resolving the 
nato dispute 
kohl expressed satisfaction with the accord on nato defense 
strategy that put off for at least two years a controversial 
project to upgrade the nuclear weapons bush took care to share the 
limelight declaring the compromise a victory for the nato 
alliance not for any single point of view 
the chancellor has pointed out repeatedly since the brussels 
accord that he will soon be talking over the new alliance position 
with gorbachev 
the kremlin leader arrives in bonn on june 12 for a fourday 
visit that west german officials look forward to as a chance to 
keep the disarmament momentum going 
the chancellor said in a speech in mainz during bushs visit 
that west germans see a historic chance to overcome the tensions 
between east and west 
but making clear which side of the european divide west germany 
stands on kohl assured bush we will never allow our commitment 
to the alliance to waver our future does not lie somewhere in no 
mans land between east and west our future lies in the community 
of free peoples 
kohls conservative christian democratic party has recently 
suffered in opinion polls and regional elections because of a 
general drift to the left among voters his popularity sunk to a 
dangerous low during the missile dispute when he appeared to take 
the stand against nato in response to public pressure 
some us officials said privately during the bonn summit that 
the compromise reached in brussels was engineered by the americans 
to rescue kohl from his political woes 
should kohl lose power during the federal elections in december 
1990 the us government would likely be confronted with a 
coalition of liberals more skeptical of american and nato policies 
kohl seemed to acknowledge the brussels outcome as a gift 
thanking bush for making it possible 
an unusually ebullient kohl described bush to the press as a 
proven friend who has always stood ready to help me in difficult 
times 
asked by reporters whether the brussels compromise would improve 
his reelection chances the chancellor who usually bristles at 
such questions beamed and declared confidently i am completely 
certain as to the results of the elections in 1990

president bush today challenged the 
soviet union to bury the cold war by ending the division of europe 
starting by tearing down the berlin wall let europe be whole and 
free he declared 
in a major speech clearly aimed at soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the president said popular demands for democratic 
reforms are sweeping through the communist world forcing a 
reexamination of cold war fears and security precautions 
the cold war he said began with the division of europe 
it can only end when europe is whole 
triumphant after his debut at the nato summit in brussels 
belgium the president spoke in the rhine river city of mainz 
before an audience in the rheingoldhalle theater four blocks away 
about 250 demonstrators protested bushs visit under a heavy police 
guard 
the protesters waved banners and placards reading bush go 
home bush is not welcome here and bush hands off 
nicaragua the main bridge spanning the rhine river was sealed 
off and helicopters circled the hall where bush spoke 
in the capital of bonn boats crammed with security agents in 
diving gear watched over the nearby rhine when bush made a farewell 
visit to us ambassador vernon walters youth are the world and 
i hope what happened within nato guarantees the future the 
president told several hundred flagwaving americans and west 
germans who massed on the ambassadors lawn 
it was his first and only major address during a weeklong trip 
to italy belgium germany and britain after todays speech and a 
cruise down the rhine river bush flew to london for talks with 
prime minster margaret thatcher who greeted him at heathrow 
airport as a band played marching tunes 
bushs nato proposals for cutbacks in conventional eastwest 
troop levels and armaments drew another positive response from 
soviet officials today gennady gerasimov spokesman for the soviet 
foreign ministry said on abctvs good morning america that 
we ask for a timeout to study it but the initial reaction is 
positive 
the central theme of the mainz speech was a call for freedom and 
democracy for all of europe 
the world has waited long enough said bush who plans to 
visit poland and hungary in july the time is right let europe 
be whole and free 
in the east brave men and women are showing us the way 
bush said 
look at poland where solidarity and the catholic church have 
won legal status the forces of freedom are putting the soviet 
status quo on the defensive 
in the west we have succeeded because we have been faithful 
to our values and our vision but on the other side of the rusting 
iron curtain their vision failed 
he said that nowhere is the division between east and west more 
obvious than in berlin where communist authorities erected a wall 
of concrete and barbed wire in 1961 in an effort to halt the flow 
of refugees to the west 
there a brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor and brother 
from brother bush said that wall stands as a monument to the 
failure of communism it must come down 
he issued that challenge as part of a series of proposals to 
heal europes tragic division to help europe become whole and 
free 
bush said berlin should become a center of commerce and 
cooperation instead of confrontation 
bring glasnost to east berlin he declared 
bush said the west and east should cooperate to foster free 
elections in eastern europe and he offered western technical 
training and other steps to help the east cope with environmental 
problems that threaten both sides 
recalling the measures he proposed at the nato summit for cuts 
in us and soviet combat troops in europe bush reiterated his 
call for the soviet union and its allies to open their skies to 
reciprocal unarmed aerial surveillance flights to monitor military 
activities 
he also called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons 
summing up bush said growing political freedom in the east 
a berlin without barriers a cleaner environment a less 
millitarized europe each is a noble goal 
taken together they are the foundation of our larger vision 
a europe that is free and at peace with itself he said 
let the soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their 
legitimate security interests the president said our goal is 
to convince them step by step that their definition of security 
is obsolete that their deepest fears are unfounded 
bush said the very concept of a divided europe was under siege 
not by armies but by the spread of ideas that began in mainz 
the birthplace of johannes gutenberg inventor of the printing 
press 
bush said the power of democracy was sweeping across eurasia 
this one idea is why the communist world from budapest to beijing 
is in ferment 
bush told leaders of the eastern bloc they were unleashing a 
force they will find difficult to channel or control the hunger 
for liberty of oppressed peoples who have tasted freedom 
bush arrived in bonn on tuesday after the twoday summit in 
brussels and conferred today with west german leaders before the 
rhine river cruise 
an upbeat bush called the summit meeting a double hit 
because it produced a united allied front on shortrange nuclear 
weapons and favorable reaction to his proposal for cuts in us and 
soviet combat troop strength in europe to 275000 on each side 
at a postsummit news conference bush noted that the soviet 
union has a more than 31 advantage in shortrange tactical nuclear 
missiles over nato forces 
why dont they just unilaterally reduce to equal numbers 
bush said now thered be a good challenge 
the communique winding up the 40th anniversary nato summit 
contained a compromise specifying that only a partial reduction 
in battlefield nuclear weapons would be pursued with the east 
that limited step was a setback for west germany which had 
sought early ussoviet negotiations with the possible aim of 
eliminating the missiles both in nato and the sovietled warsaw 
pact 
despite the tilt toward the us position the germans did not 
leave the summit emptyhanded on a related issue bush and mrs 
thatcher agreed to bonns demand for a delay in modernization of 
the usbuilt lance missile launchers which are deployed mostly 
in west germany 
in a televised interview bush said he was encouraged overall by 
initial soviet reaction to natos stand on shortrange missiles 
bush dismised a complaint from foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady gerasimov in moscow that natos communique links 
negotiations on nuclear weapons to reductions in conventional 
forces 
the west will not let mr gorbachev dictate the terms of any 
discussion bush said i would encourage the soviets in a 
spirit of good will to come forward and talk and not try to dictate 
some terms through a spokesman

foreign minister sousuke uno agreed wednesday to 
become japans next prime minister at the behest of a governing 
party crippled by scandal and divided by the choice 
the liberal democrats turned to uno 66 after elder statesman 
masayoshi ito refused the job 
uno was attending a meeting in paris and agreed by telephone 
apparently with some reluctance to become head of the party and to 
replace prime minister noboru takeshita 
ryutaro hashimoto deputy secretarygeneral of the party 
appeared at a news conference and quoted uno as saying i am not 
confident i can handle the job when the party is facing such a 
difficult time but now that the party is in an unprecedented 
crisis i will commit myself for the party 
hashimoto said party leaders decided uno was currently the 
most suited candidate as successor to takeshita the prime 
minister is resigning to take responsibility for the recruit 
influencebuying scandal which stained the top ranks of politics 
business and the bureaucracy 
opposition within the party indicated uno may have a difficult 
time even if gets the expected approval from parliament where the 
liberal democrats have a large majority 
some oppose the foreign minister because he is a senior member 
of the party faction of former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
during whose tenure in 198287 the scandal developed 
i am outraged by this nonsense of giving the countrys highest 
office which only one person can assume to a sort of managing 
director of the nakasone company former prime minister takeo 
fukuda told reporters i am totally amazed 
fukuda 84 had lobbied against uno his own name was one of 
many mentioned as possible candidates during the long search 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral of the japan socialist 
party the largest opposition group said the recruit scandal 
involved corruption during yasuhiro nakasones administration it 
is a violent act to appoint one of nakasones aides as the next 
prime minister 
business leaders welcomed the choice noting that uno has gained 
international experience as foreign minister since november 1987 
and has not been touched by the scandal 
the liberal democrats need someone with a clean image to boost 
their popularity before elections this summer for half of 
parliaments upper house it has taken more than a month to find 
such a person after takeshita announced april 25 that he would 
resign 
ito the 75yearold chairman of the party executive council 
was a popular first choice but turned the job down may 13 on 
grounds of poor health and dissatisfaction with how the party was 
handling political reform 
once ito had refused the search was complicated by the fact 
that so many party leaders had received political donations or 
profitable stock deals from recruit co an information and 
publishing conglomerate accused of buying favors and influence 
unos name emerged last weekend as the choice of takeshita then 
the collective leadership became involved 
hashimoto said the decision was reached in meetings wednesday 
involving himself takeshita ito michio watanabe chairman of the 
party policy committee and ichiro yamanouchi party leader in the 
upper house 
he said it was endorsed by the party secretarygeneral shintaro 
abe who is hospitalized after gall bladder surgery 
resistance to uno appeared to be spreading wednesday 
a group of 48 younger party members said the leaders rather 
than choosing a new prime minister should take responsibility for 
the scandal by resigning their party posts 
kyodo news service said the group planned to put up its own 
candidate for the party leadership 
former prime minister zenko suzuki and toshio komoto head of 
the partys fifthlargest faction said the public might not accept 
uno because of his ties to nakasone 
nakasone resigned from the party because of the recruit scandal 
but he has retained his seat in parliament and analysts expect his 
influence to continue 
fukuda and suzuki had argued for separation of the jobs of party 
chief and prime minister

a team of scientists is going on a 
mount mckinley expedition to determine among other things how high 
is high 
the team from the school of engineering at the university of 
alaskaanchorage will carry sophisticated measuring equipment up 
north americas tallest peak 
with the help of a satellite the equipment will try to 
remeasure the height of alaskas most popular attraction 
currently recorded at 20320 feet 
but all that is of secondary interest to the scientists 
ron cothren an assistant professor of engineering said the 
team actually wants to measure the mountains gravitational 
attraction 
what difference does it make if the mountain is a foot or two 
higher cothran said monday what this will really do is give 
us a feel for the effect of the mountains mass right now we have 
no idea what kind of attraction mckinley has 
the experiment is being conducted with the national geodetic 
survey and the us geological survey equipment will be installed 
and left at the mountains 18000 foot level cothren said 
the team is to go thursday to the climbers base camp and leave 
from there when weather permits 
the experiment probably wont make the mountain officially 
taller or shorter certainly no more than 100 feet each way 
cothren said 
mount rainier in washington state was remeasured with the 
satellite technique recently and was found to be 1 feet taller 
than its official measurement

walt disney studios screened six rare 
antinazi films made in 1942 and 1943 for the first time in more 
than 40 years during an international animated film festival 
wednesday 
the six clips starring mickey mouse donald duck and other 
disney characters have been carefully preserved and locked up at 
the disney studios since the war 
the 1943 clip victory through air power based on a book by 
maj alexander de seversky depicts the importance of strategic air 
bombing to allied victory 
another cartoon shows donald duck dreaming he is condemned to 
live in nazi germany and in donald gets drafted the famous 
duck and his friend pete join the us army 
the clips will be shown again at a retrospective exhibition in 
london in november before they are returned to the studios for 
safekeeping 
disney is aware of the extremely nationalistic content of the 
clips and their use of stereotypes 
it is absolutely acceptable to present these films from the 
war period to professionals to people able to appreciate this type 
of animation in its context but it wouldnt be right to reproduce 
them on cassettes or to edit them for the public disney studios 
senior vice president peter schneider told the associated press 
that would not reflect the spirit of disney today he added 
walt disney has always had a progressive image and one must 
situate these clips in their right context which is during a 
special wartime period he said 
only a thousand or people will be able to see the onetime 
screening of the six cartoons the festival officials received more 
than 3000 requests mostly from professionals to attend the event 
according to jean lux xibera director of the annecy festival 
the presence of disney films in such an event is an event in 
itself except for retrospectives disney has never accepted 
he said 
schneider said the studios presence at the invitation of the 
organizers is part of a new policy and it would participate in 
other similar festivals 
the animated film festival ends thursday this year 215 films 
were selected out of more than 900 for the competition

tens of thousands of soviets have taken 
advantage of relaxed travel restrictions to come hungary to buy 
goods that are unavailable at home the hungarian news agency 
reported wednesday 
four new border stations were opened on the hungariansoviet 
border march 1 and most restrictions on travel for people living 
in the border area were lifted 
hungary has introduced some of the most liberal travel laws in 
eastern europe allowing its citizens to travel as often as they 
can afford to other east bloc countries still restrict travel of 
their citizens to other soviet bloc countries 
according to the state news agency mti authorities expected no 
more than 350000 people to cross the soviethungarian border 
before the end of the year in the first three months however 15 
million people have crossed the border mti said customs officials 
processed 98000 passports on a single day recently 90 percent of 
which were soviet mti said 
shops in the border area have insufficient stocks of items in 
high demand among soviet tourists toothpaste soap deodorant 
margarine and brandy it said 
the news agency compared the onslaught of soviet shopping 
tourists to the invasion of austria in recent months by 
hungarian shoppers stocking up on electronic items and household 
appliances nearly 1 million hungarians traveled to austria in the 
week preceding the introduction of new customs regulations in april 
there are too few currency exchange offices and gas stations in 
the soviethungarian border area mti said makeshift markets have 
appeared in parking lots near the border where money can be 
exchanged on the black market and some goods are sold from car 
trunks the news agency said 
officials are to meet this week to discuss the opening of more 
bordercrossing stations mti said

people at high risk of catching aids may silently 
harbor the aids virus inside their bodies for years while appearing 
on standard blood tests to be free of infection research has found 
the study found that onequarter of a group of homosexual men 
who engaged in risky sex were infected but produced no telltale 
antibodies that ordinarily are the hallmark of aids virus exposure 
health officials check for these antibodies produced by the 
body in reaction to an infection to make sure that blood 
transfusions and organs for transplants are free of the lethal 
virus 
dr william a haseltine of danafarber cancer institute in 
boston an aids expert familiar with the research cautioned that 
the discovery raises the sobering possibility that people with 
silent infections may pass on the virus through blood and organ 
donations 
however dr steven m wolinsky of northwestern university a 
coauthor of the study said that even if they can transmit the 
virus he believes the blood supply is safe because people at high 
risk of aids have already voluntarily stopped donating blood 
antibody screening of large population groups also is used to 
gauge how many people are infected with hiv the aids virus and the 
us centers for disease control estimates that between 1 million 
and 15 million americans carry the virus 
but the latest research means that the infection could be 
considerably more widespread than we anticipated haseltine said 
in an interview 
the new work found that hiv can permanently insert itself into 
the genes of blood cells but stay hidden so the body never attacks 
it with antibodies people may make no aids antibodies for three 
years and perhaps much longer after they become infected 
the prevalence of this is not known but it certainly says 
theres a possibility of a silent reservoir of hiv infection 
said wolinsky 
the research was directed by dr david t imagawa of the 
university of california at los angeles and published in thursdays 
new england journal of medicine it was based on 1637 homosexual 
men in los angeles who were enrolled in the study in 1984 and 1985 
among them were 133 men who had no aids antibodies but continued 
to engage in risky anal sex in test tubes their white blood cells 
were stimulated to grow this released any aids virus hidden inside 
the cells so it could be detected 
they found that 31 of the 133 had silent aids infections while 
four of these men eventually began to produce aids antibodies the 
rest did not for followup periods ranging up to three years 
while the study raises concern about the effectiveness of 
current screening tests there is also a bright side to the finding 
the good news is that at least some fraction of people when 
exposed seem to control the infection said haseltine we 
would guess that as long as it stays in that controlled state 
people are going to stay healthy it gives us a new target to shoot 
for in terms of therapy 
how long this quiet state of infection may last is unclear 
although haseltine speculated that it might be life long for some 
people 
the report may also help answer one of the mysteries of the aids 
epidemic why about half of the longtime sex partners of infected 
homosexual men do not appear to catch the virus haseltine said the 
new work suggests that a substantial number of these people may 
harbor silent infections

transportation officials are considering 
opening up a road that would give new meaning to the term car pool 
the concretelined los angeles river dry 300 days a year would

representatives of the progressive baltic 
republics challenged the kremlins traditional notion of tight 
central control wednesday by pressing the new parliament to endorse 
their campaign for sovereignty 
the most radical demand to the congress of peoples deputies 
came from anatoly gorbunov the president of latvia who said the 
soviet constitution should be changed to ensure that the 15 
republics not the central government hold the major powers 
only a republic can delegate power to the union because the 
republics created the union said gorbunov a reformminded 
protege of president mikhail s gorbachev 
the latvian leader proposed recognizing the 15 republics to be 
sovereign states with the power to control their own resources 
make their own laws and conclude a new agreement of union 
the two other baltic republics estonia and lithuania already 
have defied moscow by declaring themselves sovereign with the right 
to overturn soviet laws 
gorbunov said a revision of the power structure is needed to 
eradicate the roots of ethnic tension 
the ussr is a union a multinational state formed on the 
basis of agreement by equal republics with selfdetermination of 
nations he said 
the three baltic nations were incorporated into the soviet union 
in 1940 under a secret protocol between nazi germany and the 
kremlin and some residents and local officials have called for the 
renunciation of the agreement 
in a speech lithuanian party chief algirdas brazauskas demanded 
the kremlin reveal the historical truth about the pact he also 
complained that moscow bureaucrats are preventing the baltic 
republics from carrying out plans for economic independence 
the highestlevel comment on gorbunovs radical proposals came 
from anatoly lukyanov elected monday as vice president he said 
the proposals may go too far in distancing the republics from the 
central government 
there should be a melting of centralism republican 
selfmanagement and local management lukyanov said in an 
interview 
estonias premier indrek toome stressed economic independence 
in his speech to the 2250 deputies not mentioning his republics 
demand for veto power over laws passed in central bodies he said 
some people were trying to distort the baltics demands 
what i mentioned does not mean the desire to somehow separate 
from the allunion problems although some people try to attach 
this to us such an accusation is not serious because the closed 
economiy is doomed on the contrary integration between the 
republics and regions must deepen toome said

mayor richard arrington asked on 
wednesday that a special state prosecutor be appointed to determine 
whether federal agents illegally tried to frame him and other black 
birmingham officials 
i have an obligation to try to remove any cloud of suspicion 
over this office arrington said at a news conference 
the mayor says a developer robert moussalem of suburban 
trussville told him fbi and internal revenue service agents were 
trying to entrap arrington in a phony land deal 
moussalem who has been charged with bribery says agents were 
after arrington and other black officials from alabamas largest 
city including city council president william bell councilman 
jeff germany and state rep john rogers arrington became 
birminghams first black mayor in 1980 and is in his third term 
the mayor released a letter in which he asked attorney general 
don siegelman to appoint h lewis gillis of montgomery a former 
prosecutor as a special assistant attorney general to look into 
the accusations 
this investigation will focus on whether certain persons 
engaged in criminal solicitation conspiracy attempted bribery 
andor obstruction of the citys governmental operations the 
letter said 
arrington said the city would pay gillis expenses but that his 
investigation would be independent 
requests for the appointment of a particular prosecutor are not 
that unusual said joy patterson a spokeswoman for siegelman 
adding that the attorney general was not immediately available to 
comment 
us attorney frank donaldson has said that moussalems 
allegations are too absurd to merit comment 
arringtons special counsel donald watkins said donaldson and 
the justice department have a conflict of interest in this it 
would be a conflict to prosecute moussalem and use him as a 
material witness in another matter 
a federal grand jury indicted moussalem on may 1 on charges that 
he tried to bribe undercover agents to call off tax audits and 
investigations 
arrington released a copy of a nov 23 letter from donaldson to 
moussalem that offered favorable consideration of his criminal 
charges in exchange for his cooperation and immunity for any acts 
he committed under federal direction 
unfortunately a number of black elected officials have been 
put under a cloud without criminal charges against them watkins 
said we just want to get to the bottom of it and find out what 
is going on 
he also said that there appears to be a concerted effort to 
discredit and taint through innuendo certain black officials 
watkins said that we want to find out the truth no matter who 
may be affected somebody is lying and we need to find out whos 
lying

time magazine published a fullpage apology 
wednesday for an advertisement in its british edition that featured 
faded red swastikas and the slogan poor use of color can ruin 
your presentation 
the magazine blamed it on a lapse while the advertiser and 
the ad agency admitted bad judgment and regretted any offense 
the fullpage ad in last weeks edition was placed by the 
presentation co a london firm that offers expertise in image 
enhancement through graphics 
it showed the kind of microphoned podium used by nazi leaders to 
address crowds with two large swastikas in the background 
using inappropriate colors can completely take the edge off an 
aggressive presentation the ad said in part offering to show 
how special effects can excite a flagging audience and how 
symbols can be used to explain ideas 
we cant promise to get your name in the history books but it 
should find its way into a clients notebook the ad said 
miles johnson a director of the presentation co said it was 
obviously a terrible error of judgment on behalf of us and our 
advertising agency we wrongly werent aware of the distress that 
it would cause a lot of people 
the ad gave the companys telephone number and johnson told the 
associated press he received complaining calls enough for us to 
feel that it was offending far too many people 
derek carstens of tilbey and leeves the agency that wrote the 
ad said we thought the humor would in fact ridicule the topic 
the intention was not to offend anybody and insofar we have 
offended a section of the community we are sorry it was an error 
of judgment he said the company received about 14 complaints 
the ad appeared only in time internationals british edition 
which sells 66000 copies the apology signed time the weekly 
newsmagazine said it understandably offended many readers 
time maintains strict procedures for acceptance of advertising 
materials but regrettably our system failed to prevent the 
appearance of the advertisement we apologize for the lapse 
anita blandford in charge of times british sales said the ad 
kind of slipped through the system it arrived late and went 
straight to the printer in holland she said 
like all time international material the ad was sent to new 
york headquarters for approval but the reproduction didnt 
clearly show up the nature of the ad she said 
in new york brian brown a spokesman for time magazine 
confirmed ms blandfords account of what happened the fax had 
failed us he said 
he said once the embarrassing mistake was discovered the 
company rushed to put an apology in print and had in fact delayed 
the press run so that it might run in the next issue

syrian shells exploded sporadically 
around christian ports wednesday and newspapers reported 
beleaguered christian gen michel aoun is willing to negotiate with 
arab league mediators 
annahar an independent daily also quoted a rightwing 
christian militia spokesman as threatening to seek nonarab help if 
the arab league fails to convince syria to withdraw its 40000 
troops from lebanon by november 
beirut residents wearied by the continued shelling and lacking 
clear directives from the league are wondering whether they should 
relax or brace for another devastating confrontation 
this is no war and no peace are they going to fight a 
fullscale war again no one has an answer said bahjat daowe a 
bank clerk in moslem west beirut 
like many others i dont know what to do shall i bring my 
family back to beirut or not i really dont know 
about 750000 christians and moslems evacuated the capital and 
surrounding mountains during two months of shelling duels that 
started march 8 and killed at least 360 people 
the uncertainty is reflected in a statement of the syndicate of 
nongovernment schools which said it is considering reopening 
schools soon it set no date to reopen the schools closed march 
14 
syrian gunners kept shelling jounieh and byblos ports north of 
beirut on wednesday violating a ceasefire called by heads of 
state from the 22nation arab league 
police said 20 howitzer shells exploded around the ports before 
dawn no casualties were reported 
the barrage is a daily routine by syrian gunners tying to 
prevent boats delivering ammunition to aoun 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
rules said aouns gunners did not return the syrian fire 
annahar newspaper said aoun is fully prepared to cooperate 
with a threemember committee named by the arab league last week 
after its summit failed to compromise on a lebanese peace formula 
the committee king hassan ii of morocco saudi arabias king 
fahd and algerian president chadli bendjedid has six months to 
produce a settlement to end lebanons 14year civil war 
aoun has welcomed the arab effort but annahar quoted an 
unidentified spokesman for the lebanese forces christian militia as 
saying the summits outcome was a big disappointment for us 
because it did not call openly for a syrian pullout 
arab leaders reportedly want a syrian withdrawal but syria 
refused to compromise 
the christian militia supports aouns war of liberation to 
drive the 40000 syrian troops out of lebanon 
annahar quoted the militia spokesman as threatening to seek 
nonarab help to force a withdrawal if the committee fails 
annahar and the leftist daily assafir reported that foreign 
ministers of algeria saudi arabia and morocco met in rabat 
morocco on tuesday assafir said they discussed establishing a 
security committee to supervise implementation of the ceasefire 
and monitor ports 
the present violence broke out after aoun ordered a blockade of 
illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias that deflect about 100 
million in customs duties from government coffers 
druse warlord walid jumblatts militia reacted by shelling the 
christian enclave with syrian help

a reexamination of the bodies of 19 young women 
found dead under similar circumstances since 1986 revealed subtle 
evidence suggesting some victims were strangled or suffocated the 
medical examiner said wednesday 
most of the victims were cocaine addicts with a history of 
prostitution all but one were black their remains were found in 
fields and alleys in a narrow area of miami and neighboring dade 
county usually in positions indicating recent sexual activity 
police have looked at theories ranging from a serial killer to a 
previously unknown toxic cocaine reaction to explain the deaths 
few of the victims showed signs of injury 
many of the remains were too badly decomposed to reexamine 
thoroughly but seven bodies showed scanty or subtle evidence not 
inconsistent with carefully applied neck pressure dade county 
medical examiner dr joseph davis said in a report 
it is my considered opinion that the repetitive pattern of 
body position location and scene circumstances constitute a 
reasonable conclusion as to manner of death homicide he 
concluded 
the medical examiner said dr richard souviron a specialist in 
forensic odontology who helped convict serial killer ted bundy by 
matching bite marks on his victims found minute changes to 
indicate mild or moderate pressure to the mouth 
debilitated by drug use the victims could quickly lose 
consciousness without putting up much of a struggle davis said 
john farrell chief of the metrodades police detective 
division said police have the treated the deaths all along as 
potential murders 
theres a lot of this we dont understand and we dont have 
the answers farrell said davis is saying its my feeling 
this is homicide and im the boss 
the detective cautioned that the medical examiner while 
suggesting the women were murdered is not saying that 
absolutely 
he said police were still looking at the theory that a toxic 
cocaine reaction perhaps in conjunction with sex caused the 
deaths investigators have also questioned a rapist now in jail 
with a history of choking his victims into unconsciousness 
farrell emphasized that the deaths were all associated with 
people in crackhouse environments and said that whatever the 
cause there seemed to be little or no risk to the public

the irancontra trial of richard secord might 
not take place until november or later lawyers and a federal judge 
said wednesday 
at a hearing prosecutor reid weingarten suggested nov 13 as 
a possible trial date with the courts permission 
chief us district court judge aubrey robinson cautioned that 
such a date is predicated on no major problems pertaining 
to the use at trial of material that is now classified by the 
government 
secords lawyer thomas green said there is some potential 
for complications because the government may be reluctant to 
declassify some of the material for use in the courtroom 
secord enlisted by oliver north to run arms to the contras is 
accused in two indictments of conspiring offering and paying 
illegal gratuities to north and of covering up secords alleged 
profits from the irancontra affair 
the government wants to consolidate the cases but secord says 
the nine coverup charges brought april 7 should be dismissed 
they represent prosecutorial vindictiveness secord said in 
court papers 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh wants to 
combine them saying proof of the two sets of charges will 
entirely overlap 
the gratuities counts were brought on march 16 1988 as part of 
a larger indictment accusing secord of conspiring with north to 
defraud the us government by diverting money to the contras from 
secret arms sales to iran also charged with conspiracy and theft 
were former national security adviser john poindexter and secord 
business partner albert hakim 
due to national security concerns the prosecution is expected 
to abandon the conspiracy and theft counts against secord 
presenting evidence of such charges would entail a significant 
amount of nowclassified material and for this reason identical 
conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed in january against 
north 
hoping to save what is left of the 1988 indictment the 
government seeks to combine the weak remaining counts with the 
new indictment in an unfair attempt to create an aura of 
wrongdoing about general secord he said in court papers

on a riverboat that charges 
tourists 17 a ride president bush and chancellor helmut kohl 
cruised down the rhine river on wednesday past hillside vineyards 
and ancient castles silhouetted atop rugged ridgelines 
of course bush did not get the standard tour and for him it 
was free 
the threedeck stolzenfels occasionally used for state dinners 
was redecorated with persian carpets on indoor decks 
it was staffed with whitegloved waiters carrying trays of 
champagne wine and beer and hovering over an elaborate buffet 
with brilliant blue skies warm weather and friendly crowds 
waving from the shores the trip was a pictureperfect windup to 
bushs 27hour visit to west germany 
the president called it an unforgettable day on the rhine 
to make sure the excursion received maximum television and photo 
coverage the white house chartered a second riverboat for 
cameramen and photographers who followed bushs boat the photo 
boat with a capacity of 1000 or more carried only a handful of 
people 
about 300 guests were invited on bushs boat from political 
circles the arts social and industrial fields 
bush began the trip by receiving a case of local wines from 
petra mayer a queen of the winegrowing region 
he rewarded her with a kiss on the cheek at the urging of 
photographers and as his wife barbara watched on bush kissed the 
young lady again 
and for good measure he kissed her a third time mrs bush 
raised her eyes in mock dismay 
bush has been ebullient in the wake of the nato summit in 
brussels where he won endorsement for his conventionalarms 
proposal to the soviet union and helped defuse an alliance dispute 
over shortrange nuclear missiles 
the twohour river trip began at oberwesel a town which still 
retains a medieval appearance and is dominated by the sight of the 
1000yearold schonburg castle it concluded at koblenz an 
ancient city where the moselle river flows into the rhine 
as the stolzenfels plied the river a male choir serenaded the 
bushes with the legend of the loreley the wondrous maiden 
whose siren song lured sailors to shipwreck and death 
the waterway path through the rhines deeplycut valley is one 
of germanys most popular tourist attractions followed by millions 
each year 
the path is lined with picturesque castles and carefully tended 
vineyards clinging to the hillsides 
tourists pay about 17 for a trip as long as bushs but they 
dont get the same vip attention 
a cannon salute marked the beginning and end of bushs ride 
two helicopters hovered high overhead throughout the trip and 
four police boats doggedly trailed the ship 
on both shores a caravan of police cars and troop vehicles 
drove slowly to keep pace with bushs boat 
at town after town crowds of people turned out to wave to the 
president 
concluding the trip at koblenz bush went to the deutsches eck 
a world famous memorial of german unity where he signed the 
town book he said he hoped this weeks nato summit would be viewed 
in the future as one of historic consequence 
from germany bush flew to london for talks with prime minister 
margaret thatcher and a luncheon thursday with queen elizabeth ii

chineseamerican professionals are joining with 
chinese students in the united states in an effort to raise money 
and channel it to protesters in beijing by way of the black market 
and other backdoor routes 
a fullpage ad bearing some 500 names most of them professors 
and other intellectuals appeared in tuesdays new york times 
appealing for donations for the ad hoc committee in support of the 
chinese democratic movement 
an organizer princeton university professor yingshih yu said 
the money will go toward such things as setting up a network of 
computers fax machines and copiers and helping the student 
protesters put out their own newspapers 
i think they need all kinds of money for good causes for 
pushing the movement further yu said tuesday in a telephone 
interview from princeton nj 
he said more than 1000 people mostly intellectuals and 
businessmen have joined the fund drive that took out the 45000 
ad this is mostly by american citizens ethnic chinese most of 
them he said 
the professor said the campaign organized at princeton expects 
to raise about 200000 and send it to china in cash and checks 
with chinese students and scholars returning to their homeland from 
the united states 
the money will go directly to the students to take advantage of 
the black market exchange rate which is nearly three times the 
official rate yu said otherwise the government will rob the 
money out of the students pockets 
the black market is not really so black everyone uses it 
its kind of an open secret he said 
students in boston new york san francisco and other cities 
also have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the students and 
others who have occupied beijings central tiananmen square for 
nearly three weeks to press their demands for democracy the united 
states is host to an estimated 40000 students from china 
yu said he knows of no one who has run afoul of the law in china 
for taking money in for protesters most people have relatives in 
the united states that send them money from time to time and they 
take it to the streets he said 
other methods will include electronic transfers between 
companies doing business in both the united states and china and 
transactions carried out in chinatown storefronts said yu a 
professor of history and east asian studies 
in the states i have guessed we have raised 150000 from 
overseas chinese students said activist pei minxin a thirdyear 
graduate student at harvard 
in the boston area several universities pooled their 
resources together and we collected something like 37000 of that 
amount about 11000 has already channeled back in the form of cash 
and equipment 
the rest will be sent when there is confirmation that the money 
has been spent properly he said wednesday 
lets just say the money is being brought in wired in 
transferred in all the ways business gets money into the country 
is being copied by us pei said wednesday the government would 
have to shut down all the international transactions in order to 
stop money from being sent in and thats impossible for them 
he said money is being taken in by tourists and other 
goodhearted people none of whom are given large sums so as 
not to arouse suspicion with bulging wallets pei also said he 
knows of no one who has run afoul of chinese authorities 
theyve got to catch people delivering money and even that is 
very hard because we can say hes paying off a debt its just a 
relatives money pei said 
storefront transactions are routinely used by chinese to send 
gifts home said justin yu a reporter for the world journal 
americas largest chinese language newspaper 
for example a person leaves 100 with a storefront operator 
who then has a contact in china deliver the equivalent in chinese 
money out of his own pocket to the intended recipient the reporter 
said in return the contact has 100 on deposit outside the 
country 
its illegal activity but its not secret in the chinese 
community said yu president of the chinese language press club 
in new york too many people are doing this kind of business you 
just cant stop it anymore 
justin yu said supporters of the students are also taking 
advantage of uschinese business links by putting down money for 
say a fax machine at an electronics company in america the 
merchandise is picked up at a connected store in china

a new plan to integrate higher education 
in louisiana without closing or merging any colleges puts much of 
the burden of success or failure on a single governing board 
officials said wednesday 
replacing four boards with a single powerful one was pushed by 
gov buddy roemer over the objections of some black leaders who 
felt it would be insensitive to needs of students at the states 
two mostly black universities 
on tuesday a special master appointed by three federal judges 
to find a way to settle a 15yearold lawsuit against louisiana by 
the justice department submitted his final desegregation proposal 
for court approval 
paul verkuil president of william and mary college in virginia 
called for giving the governor power to appoint a 17member 
governing board subject to state senate confirmation verkuil said 
the board should include at least seven blacks show a geographic 
balance represent all schools and include a student 
unlike the states current board of regents the board would not 
share power with boards that oversee the mostly black southern 
university system the mostly white louisiana state university 
system and the smaller regional schools 
larry crain president of the board overseeing regional 
colleges said it will be up to the unified governing board to 
implement verkuils plan successfully 
it all depends on how the new board approaches this if they 
follow whats been laid out here it can happen the state is going 
to have to take this very seriously to bring about integration 
crain said 
sen william jefferson a new orleans lawyer who represents 
southern university at baton rouge one of the two mostly black 
universities said he had not received a copy of the plan 
i do know the single board has nothing to do with 
desegregation and it seems to be the centerpiece of this plan 
jefferson said 
thomas todd of chicago attorney for the other predominantly 
black college grambling state said he could not comment on the 
plan until he received a copy 
the plan would provide additional money to the mostly black 
universities to develop programs more attractive to white students 
it also would establish admission standards to funnel 
betterprepared students into selective universities and others 
into a new community college system currently any graduate of a 
louisiana high school can attend any state college 
jack andonie chairman of the lsu board of supervisors said 
these changes could advance desegregation somewhat but until 
they have some significant merging of some schools theres not 
going to be much integration 
the schools that need integrating have to be good and the costs 
reasonable to attract students he said 
if theyre not happy theyre simply not going to go to the 
schools involved andonie said 
i dont think this is a cosmetic plan roemers attorney 
john kennedy said i think you will look on the landscape of 
higher education in five years and it will not be the same the 
changes will be fundamental quality and desegregation

local politicians apparently reacting 
to public uproar decided wednesday not to send a group of teenage 
offenders on a sixmonth rehabilitation cruise to the caribbean at 
taxpayer expense 
the social board in the suburb of kista dropped plans to 
participate in the cruise after it received a bomb threat 
social commissioner ragnar gotestam later announced on tv that 
the project had to be canceled because at least two community 
social boards had changed their mind about the 80000 cruise on a 
53foot sailing craft to saint lucia and other caribbean islands 
he said he hoped to pursue the project later 
eight teenagers convicted of crimes such as assault theft 
burglary and property damage were candidates for the training 
cruise at least three social workers would have accompanied them 
the program also called for instruction in citizenship and 
authorites had given assurances there would be no chance to escape 
swedens liberal penal system accents rehabilitation rather than 
punishment but it has come under increasing criticism recently as 
too lenient 
the daily newspaper svenska dagbladet added its voice to those 
critics of the cruise 
how could the district social board in unison make a decision 
so distant from reason and judgment and with such total lack of 
contact with the way ordinary people think it asked in an 
editorial 
authorities argued the offenders were influenced by their family 
background and rough neighborhoods and that getting away would be 
more helpful than harsh punishment 
none of the eight is serving prison sentences although they 
must report regularly to the authorities their behavior was deemed 
so bad that no halfway houses would accept them 
these children need love and security said stockholm social 
director ulf andersson defending the caribbean trip for the 
youths who under press regulations have not been identified 
this is not a vacation but a working trip said anders 
roxe who would have escorted them he told swedish radio that 400 
convicts had gone through the training program in swedish waters 
and 200 are employed as officers at sea 
people should be happy to get rid of them and maybe to see 
these people being reintegrated into a working life as new men 
after six months he said 
among the opponents of the cruise program are national police 
chief bjorn eriksson and youth minister margot wallstrom they 
ridiculed the idea of sending the youths to an area where drugs 
abound 
last year a similar public furor forced authorities to scrap 
plans to send a convicted criminal on a trip to the egyptian 
pyramids the authorities had said it would help the convict who 
was about to be released to readjust to society 
swedish prisons have a generous furlough program after 
completing onethird of their sentence prisoners are eligible for 
up to six 48hour passes a year the prison service reported 287 
violations out of 8951 furloughs granted in 1987 
prisons also have frequent conjugal visits for most inmates 
the system came under scathing attack when swedens most 
notorious spy stig bergling slipped away while on furlough in 
1987 and apparently escaped with his wife to the soviet union 
in another experiment longterm prisoners can spend twoweek 
vacations relaxing with their families in an unguarded holiday 
village in central sweden with skiing in winter hiking in the 
woods or swimming in summer

house speaker jim wright beset by 
investigations of alleged ethics violations has decided to resign 
his leadership post and planned to make an announcement to the 
house today sources said 
he told me himself said one house member who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
the lawmaker and other sources who said wright would resign as 
speaker did not say whether he also would give up his house seat 
spokesman mark johnson would say only that wright planned to 
deliver his speech in the house chamber and the speech would last 
more than half an hour 
wright worked alone in his office on the statement throughout 
the afternoon up until minutes before he was to deliver it 
wrights resignation has been expected since last week when his 
lawyers entered into several hours of negotiations with the ethics 
committee in an attempt to win dismissal of some of the alleged 
violations in exchange for the speakers stepping down 
wright himself has consistently denied knowingly violating 
ethics rules but his political support among democrats in the 
house eroded steadily as the ethics committee methodically 
investigated his finances 
one of the speakers staunch defenders said tuesday the pressure 
on wright to quit appeared overwhelming 
i believe its probably too late to change things in his 
favor said rep charles wilson dtexas although justice 
would be served by following the game to the end wilson said he 
expected his friend to step down 
the heat continued as cbs and the washington post quoting 
unidentified sources said the justice departments public 
integrity section was launching a preliminary criminal 
investigation of wright justice department sources have 
previously said the department was monitoring ethics proceedings 
against wright but had not decided on a probe of its own 
sources also told those two news organizations and the 
associated press the fbi is looking into allegations of payroll 
padding on the staff of rep william h gray iii of pennsylvania 
the fourthranking democrat in the house 
gray currently vying to move up in the house leadership said 
after cbs broke the story tuesday that it was an outrageous 
lie he said he was questioned by fbi agents monday but assured 
he was not the subject of an investigation 
the justice department declined comment on the report 
not waiting for wrights final decision some of his own 
lieutenants were scrambling to move up in the ranks the pressure 
on wright and the power game were made all the more intense by the 
announcement last weekend that rep tony coelho of california the 
house democratic whip would be resigning coelhos resignation 
followed reports he earned nearly 7000 from a junk bond 
investment for which he never had to put up any of his own money 
wright was charged last month by the house committee on 
standards of official conduct with violating house rules in 69 
instances 
the most serious of those involve allegedly accepting improper 
gifts including a nowork job for his wife from a developer 
friend and circumventing house rules on outside income through 
bulk sales of his book reflections of a public man 
the speaker has repeatedly insisted that he broke no house rules 
or any laws and he has vowed to fight for the honor of his wife 
who he contends earned her pay 
the ethics committee was scheduled to meet thursday to consider 
wrights motion to dismiss those charges im convinced our 
motions are legally well grounded he said tuesday 
another factor adding pressure on wright was a continuing ethics 
committee probe into areas not covered by its original set of 
charges 
rep john t myers of indiana the senior republican on the 
committee said in answer to a question tuesday that it might 
expand its investigation into wrights investment in a gas well 
drilling venture and a deal involving a nursing home company 
its possible we could vote for a preliminary inquiry on those 
two issues myers said 
house majority leader thomas s foley is in line to succeed 
wright foley has no known opposition for the speakership 
rep richard gephardt dmo appeared to be the front runner to 
replace foley dwash if he moved up rep ed jenkins dga was 
competing against gephardt 
the race to succeed coelho as majority whip was more wide open 
candidates included gray the chairman of the house democratic 
caucus rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee and rep david bonior dmich 
the chief deputy whip rep henry a waxman dcalif a powerful 
member of the energy and commerce committee also was weighing his 
support

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
rose in april for the second straight month in the biggest increase 
since december the commerce department reported wednesday 
the strong 27 percent april gain followed a 07 percent hike in 
march and 12 percent and 2 percent declines in january and 
february orders had soared 47 percent in december 
total orders registered 2394 billion on a seasonably adjusted 
basis in april 
robert brusca an economist with nikko securities co 
international inc in new york compared the factory orders report 
with the index of leading economic indicators which commerce also 
released on wednesday 
factory orders were absolutely surprising he said while 
the indicators showed a slower 08 percent increase after falling 
for two months 
it means he said the porridge is not too hot not too 
cold and it isnt just right were just vacillating between the 
two i think 
bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
said the orders report means that in april the economy picked up 
from a depressed level in march 
and yet orders were not higher in april than in 
december steinberg said so although the industrial sector of 
the economy is still advancing it doesnt have anywhere the kind 
of momentum it had in 1988 
commerce said both durable and nondurable orders rose in april 
with durables up 3 percent to 1292 billion it said all major 
industries expect fabricated metals participated in the increase 
electrical machinery orders were up 93 percent to 20 billion 
primary metals such as steel up 6 percent to 126 billion and 
transportation equipment up 14 percent to 376 billion the 
highly volatile transportation segment was up 11 percent in march 
and down 76 percent in february 
orders for nondurable goods jumped 24 percent to 1102 
billion the department reported nearly half the increase was in 
the petroleum refining industry 
the overall increase would have been higher except for a 158 
percent drop in defense orders which are subject to wide swings 
depending on when big contracts are signed 
excluding defense orders rose 36 percent after falling 03 
percent in march and 27 percent in february

oliver north says a judge should set aside his 
convictions in the irancontra affair because the prosecution made 
critical errors including failure to show any principal figure 
intended to violate the law 
in court papers filed late tuesday north said the government 
neglected to show that anyone intended to obstruct congress when 
north in november 1986 assisted in assembling a false chronology 
of an arms shipment to iran 
north was convicted of aiding and abetting the obstruction but 
a fundamental requirement of any conviction for aiding and 
abetting is that the jury first find a guilty principal the 
court papers said 
the government did not demonstrate that any principal intended 
to violate the law and to obstruct congress in november 1986 
norths lawyers said in their filing in us district court 
former national security adviser john poindexter is charged with 
obstruction and making false statements to congress in connection 
with the chronology poindexter is expected to go on trial later 
this year 
the false chronology said no one in the us government knew 
until january 1986 that a november 1985 shipment to iran contained 
arms evidence presented at norths trial showed he and more than a 
dozen us officials received intelligence in 1985 detailing the 
shipments contents 
north also was convicted of altering and destroying official 
documents he wrote to national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
detailing norths assistance to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
north is scheduled for sentencing june 23 
in the court papers north said he should be acquitted because 
testimony at the trial showed he wasnt the custodian of the 
documents 
north also was convicted of accepting a 13800 home security 
system from irancontra codefendant richard secord north who 
lives outside washington in northern virginia said the charge 
should have been brought in courts there rather than in washington 
if the court refuses to acquit north he should be granted a new 
trial on the three charges for which he was convicted he said 
the former national security council aide said us district 
court judge gerhard gesell had given improper instructions to the 
jury gesell according to norths lawyers placed too many 
restrictions on norths defense which was based on the assertion 
that all of the actions for which he was charged with crimes were 
authorized by his superiors 
gesells instructions unconstitutionally limited the jurys 
consideration of evidence in the case said north 
on wednesday secord opposed a prosecution motion to consolidate 
two sets of criminal charges against him in the irancontra affair 
secord was indicted on march 16 1988 among the charges were 
conspiring offering and paying illegal gratuities to north 
enlisted by north to run arms to the contras secord also was 
indicted april 7 for covering up from congress his alleged profits 
from the iran and contra initiatives 
the government wants to combine charges from the two 
indictments but secord said in court papers that the latest 
indictment reflects prosecutorial vindictiveness and fails to 
state a criminal offense secord is seeking to dismiss the new 
charges

sales of semiautomatic weapons boomed in 
california as the june 1 deadline for the states mandatory permit 
application drew near and gun dealers said the meanerlooking the 
gun the better the sales 
customers bought anything that looks ugly that looks like an 
assault weapon anything that may look military said tony 
cucchiara president of trader sports in san leandro the states 
largest retail gun dealer 
buyers of the weapons included collectors investors 
yuppies and others who hoped to escape the more restrictive 
buying process going into effect thursday 
most of cucchiaras customers were older men and many shoppers 
were buying the more expensive guns and buying more than one 
putting them away for investment purposes 
there are people buying these things as souvenirs too he 
said tuesday little old men and little old women are walking 
into the store saying they want to buy an ak47 
people who bought an assault weapon before thursday merely had 
to get it registered 
but beginning june 1 the sale of more than 50 kinds of 
semiautomatic assault rifles pistols and shotguns is virtually 
banned in california by a new law that includes a restrictive 
permit process 
the legislation and the heightened interest in semiautomatic 
weapons was prompted by a january incident in which a man with an 
ak47 a sovietdesigned assault weapon attacked a elementary 
school playground in stockton killing five students and himself 
between june 1 and jan 1 buyers must submit an application for 
a state permit similar to one required of movie studios for 
machine guns that is very restrictive said lynn montgomery 
an aide to state assemblyman mike roos 
possession of a permit is required as of jan 1 when the law 
banning sales of more than 50 specified semiautomatic rifles 
shotguns and handguns goes into effect 
people who buy those guns between june 1 and jan 1 but are 
denied permits must sell their guns to a dealer a permit holder or 
someone living outside the state montgomery said violators will 
be subject to a maximum fouryear prison term 
a man who gave his name only as barry at bampb sales in north 
hollywood said most weapons on the restricted list have already 
dried up 
many gun dealers said they expected the lastminute surge of 
interest in the weapons and compared the demand to bread and 
gasoline shortages 
the public reacts very uniformly said joe ellithorpe 
president of pony express in los angeles they run on anything 
they cant get their hands on thats not unusual thats a public 
nature item 
shop owners said prices also were skyrocketing 
carmichael said that when the boom was starting he got two 
ar15s the civilian version of the militarys m16 from a 
supplier for about 569 each 
i called them back about three weeks later and asked them if 
they had any more they said they still had several ar15s in stock 
and wanted 1975 wholesale he said 
sales have been brisk ever since gov george deukmejian said he 
would sign the legislation said don smith manager at arms amp ammo 
supply in san bruno people are feeling a little more rushed now 
were selling about 60 to 70 a week weve been selling 10 guns a 
day for the last week 
at fremont discount gun a manager named gary who declined to 
give his last name said cost distinguishes the gun collector from 
others anyone who goes out and pays 3000 for a sig assault 
rifle is not going to shoot it its like a fine work of art like 
buying a piece of sculpture 
just north in castro valley combat arms owner richard bash said 
his customers have been whitecollar professionals ranging from 
attorneys to police officers what im seeing is the professional 
people buying while the buyings still good he said 
one wholesaler brought in 700 ak47s in one day and sold all 
of them said george alger store gun buyer for big r country 
west guns in west sacramento 
bash declined to give numbers on sales but said hes selling 
three times the usual number of semiautomatic weapons cucchiara 
of trader sports said his shop used to sell two or three 
semiautomatics each day and is selling 30 to 40aday now 
at hamph enterprises in redwood city a telephone recording told 
memorial day weekend callers that the answering machine was on 
because business was so good that no one had time to come to the

wednesday for extradition of adnan khashoggi the jailed saudi 
financier and arms dealer accused of helping ferdinand and imelda 
marcos plunder the philippines 
the american request accompanied by 243 pages of evidence 
arrived six weeks after police arrested khashoggi 54 while he was 
having breakfast at a luxury hotel in bern the us embassy had 
asked that he be detained 
a justice ministry statement said the swiss federal police were 
studying the extradition request ministry spokesman joerg kistler 
said it was too early to tell when a decision would be made 
lawyers for khashoggi said a few days after his arrest april 18 
that they would do everything possible to prevent extradition but 
have not taken legal steps to challenge his detention 
ralph zloczower khashoggis swiss lawyer was not available 
wednesday night a secretary at his bern office said he would have 
no comment 
if switzerland decides the us charges have legal foundation 
khashoggi will be granted a hearing the justice ministry said an 
extradition order can be appealed to the federal tribunal 
switzerlands supreme court 
khashoggi the marcoses five other people and a california bank 
were indicted in october by a us district court in new york the 
indictment accuses the ousted president and his wife of stealing 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury to buy real 
estate and expensive art in new york 
the us government says khashoggi posed as owner of some of the 
assets as a cover according to prosecutors 
khashoggi is charged in the indictment with racketeering 
conspiracy obstruction of justice and mail fraud racketeering 
alone carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison 
swiss authorities said a us diplomatic note asking that 
khashoggi be arrested cited four buildings in manhattan and a 
collection of paintings that disappeared from a manila museum

said khashoggi allegedly bought them for his friend marcos as part 
of obfuscation maneuvers 
khashoggi is said to have been the main financier and middleman 
of the irancontra affair in which proceeds of secret us arms 
sales to iran where channeled to rebels fighting the leftist 
sandinista government in nicaragua

europe and the united states compared to 244 conducted by american 
inspectors at soviet sites 
both sides also succeeded during the first year in moving an 
inspection team from the other country into permanent housing 
facilities near missile plants the treaty specifies that up to 30 
inspectors may be located fulltime outside the gates of a missile 
production plant to guard against surreptious production of inf 
missiles

facilities in west jordan utah on april 17 near a hercules plant

greek and turkish cypriot leaders failed 
in nine months of talks to agree on reunifying the divided island 
before a thursday deadline and the united nations granted a 
threeweek extension 
officials said it was likely the un security council would be 
called in to mediate the deadlocked negotiations 
leaders of both communities are trying to establish a formula 
for a twostate federation under which the greek cypriot majority 
of 550000 people would share power with the 120000member turkish 
cypriot minority the greek side reportedly is pushing for a strong 
federal government while the turkish side wants a looser 
federation 
the two sides reportedly also disagree over the withdrawal of 
turkish troops and the right of 200000 greek cypriots to return 
to property they fled after the 1974 turkish invasion 
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash president of the 
breakaway state in north cyprus that is recognized only by turkey 
said he would intensify efforts for international recognition if 
the talks break off 
the talks prevented our recognition by friends once they are 
broken off there will be no obstacles to our recognition 
denktash said 
greek cypriot leader george vassiliou president of the 
internationally recognized government of cyprus blamed turkish 
intransigence for the lack of progress 
we have submitted comprehensive proposals for the solution of 
all aspects of the cyprus problem vassiliou said tuesday 
world opinion agrees that our proposals are honorable reasonable 
and can lead to an agreement 
vassiliou said he favors mediation by the security council 
while denktash does not 
in 1974 a coup by greeces military junta failed on the island 
turkey invaded the northern part of cyprus saying it was 
protecting the minority turkish cypriot community and partitioned 
the east mediterranean island 
in the wake of the invasion 40000 turkish cypriots also moved 
north taking over the homes and properties of the greek cypriot 
refugees other property was given to an estimated 50000 settlers 
brought to cyprus from the turkish mainland 
denktash in 1975 proclaimed the northern part of the island an 
independent turkish state 
the two sides are divided by a heavily fortified green line 
manned by 13000 greek cypriot troops facing an estimated 30000 
turkish army soldiers and 10000 turkish cypriot soldiers 
the buffer zone extending 112 miles across the island is 
patrolled by a 2100member united nations peacekeeping force 
the two cypriot leaders agreed on the thursday deadline when 
they embarked on their negotiations during a meeting with perez de

a woman who said masked gunmen abducted 
her two baby girls nearly three years apart was indicted wednesday 
on charges of concealing a homicide and obstructing justice in the 
1986 death of one daughter 
the grand jury indictment charged paula sims of alton with 
concealing a homicide and three counts of obstructing justice in 
the death of 13dayold loralei sims 
investigators have said the disappearance and death in late 
april of the sims second daughter 6weekold heather renewed 
interest in the earlier case 
no charges have been filed in heathers death which came after 
mrs sims and her husband robert moved to neighboring madison 
county where an investigation is under way 
jersey county states attorney richard ringhausen brought the 
charges against mrs sims in loraleis death earlier this month 
then presented evidence and witnesses to the grand jury 
donald groshong attorney for the simses would not comment on 
the indictment 
mrs sims remains free on a 10000 cash bond and no court date 
has been set 
by asking a grand jury rather than a judge in open court to 
bring the case to trial ringhausen was able to keep secret 
information from the pending madison county investigation he said 
in 1987 the couple claimed fifth amendment protection against 
selfincrimination and refused to testify before a jersey county 
grand jury that conducted an earlier investigation into loraleis 
death 
that grand jury returned no indictments and the case remained 
open 
robert sims 37 told police last month he suspected his 
29yearold wife may have killed both babies accidentally 
investigators have said 
in each case mrs sims said a masked gunman took her baby girl 
while her husband was at work 
loralei was reported abducted in june 1986 her body was 
discovered a week later in a wooded area about 150 yards from the 
simses home 
heather was reported abducted on april 29 her body was 
discovered four days later in a trash can in west alton mo 
across the mississippi river from alton 
a third sims child a 16monthold boy has been in the custody

most israelis favor affirmative action for 
women tax breaks for child care and a longer school day to allow 
more mothers to work full time according to preliminary results of 
a survey conducted wednesday 
the informal survey described by israel radio as the most 
extensive done in israel was organized by naamat the womens 
organization of the histadrut trade union federation 
the goal was to demonstrate to prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
government and the public that there is strong support for naamats 
campaign for greater economic rights for women 
while the level of education of israeli women is comparable to 
that in other developed countries the womens movement has not won 
the same support here as in the united states and europe

an 8monthold boy who was shot in the head by 
israeli soldiers lay unconscious in a hospital wednesday suffering 
from severe brain damage and breathing through a respirator 
the shooting highlighted the dispute between palestinians who 
say troops fire at demonstrators without regard for innocents and 
israeli officials who say women and children are put in the front 
lines to serve as shields and win publicity for the palestinian 
uprising 
the army confirmed that the infant mohammed hamdan kassem was 
shot by troops in the west bank refugee camp of tulkarem on 
tuesday it said the incident was under investigation 
arab reporters said clashes occurred at the camp on tuesday 
night following a march and that several people were wounded 
the jerusalem post newspaper quoted palestinian sources as 
saying mohammed was struck when his mother samira kassem 
participated in the march with the boy in her arms 
mrs kassem said she was carrying the child down an alley when 
he was hit by a stray bullet she said she did not see any clashes 
at the time 
i felt blood on his head the soldiers were about 100 yards 
away at the end of the street i shouted he was hit he was hit 
and then i ran away she said 
mrs kassem 23 was slumped on a bed outside her sons room at 
mukassed hospital in jerusalem inside mohammed lay unconscious 
the left side of his head covered by a bandage and the right side 
of his body paralyzed 
he kicked with his left foot as a nurse cleared his nasal 
passage 
he suffered severe brain damage we removed a large portion of 
contused brain tissue if he survives he will have all kinds of 
disabilities said dr wahib dajani chief anesthesiologist in 
the intensive care unit 
he displayed the tip of a plastic bullet that pierced the 
childs brain and was removed from his skull 
dajani said mohammed was the youngest victim of the palestinian 
uprising to be treated at the hospital he said the average age of 
shooting victims has decreased in recent months and that more and 
more children and teenagers were among the wounded 
the shooting of mohammed renewed the debate over the armys 
firing practices during the nearly 18monthold rebellion against 
the israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the uprising has claimed 502 palestinian lives twentytwo 
israelis also have been killed 
the palestinianrun human rights information center said 34 arab 
children under 5 have been killed by troops during the uprising 
including 29 who died from tear gas inhalation and three who were 
shot to death 
palestinians and human rights activists argue that troops fire 
wildly to break up protests often hitting bystanders that include 
young children 
the wounding of mohammed undoubtedly resulted from the armys 
indiscriminate shooting said fayez abu rahme a palestinian 
lawyer and plo supporter from gaza city 
a senior army official blamed plo activists for making cynical 
use of children in demonstrations 
by getting children killed you get more publicity and that 
keeps the uprising alive which is what the inciters want what 
better way is there than to get a child killed every day said 
col ranaan gissin deputy army spokesman 
he said young children were used as shields also to protect 
adult activists especially when plastic bullets are fired at the 
knees of demonstrators 
the responsibility for the children being there is that of the 
parents and the activists he said 
gissin said that in some cases women and children were wounded 
while walking near the scenes of clashes but that the number of 
such cases was minuscule when compared to the pattern of using 
children on purpose 
faisal husseini a leading palestinian intellectual and 
politican in jerusalem rejected the claim that children were used 
as shields 
there is no way someone is sending children to protect 
himself it is just propaganda coming from people who think they 
have more human feelings than we do he said 
under army regulations soldiers are barred from firing plastic 
bullets at children under age 16 
yossi sarid a liberal member of parliament said that while 
palestinians had used children as propaganda instruments the army 
in many instances had disregarded standing orders on opening fire 
this is the tragedy that the children have to pay for the 
blindness and stupidity of their elders he said

leftist rebels paralyzed public 
transportation wednesday and said they would make this central 
american nation ungovernable on the eve of the inauguration of a 
rightist president 
alfredo cristiani of the rightwing republican national 
alliance also known as arena takes office thursday in el

the nations 55 million citizens to boycott public transportation 
for an indefinite period starting wednesday there was no urban or 
intercity bus service on the bans first day dispatchers said 
troops in the capital seized a large cache of weapons blonging 
to the rebels who have waged a nineyear civil war against the 
government police said in a communique the seizure netted more 
than 350 sovietmade rifles 300 sticks of dynamite and more than 
15 million bullets police said 
cristiani 41 a businessman and coffee grower was elected on 
march 19 in an election with the lowest voter turnout in a decade 
the low turnout was partly attributed to a rebel transport boycott 
and many said the rebel action cost the centrist candidate the 
election 
the transport ban has been a favorite tactic of rebels who 
threaten to shoot at or set fire to cars or buses found on the 
roads five traffic bans were enforced last year 
wednesdays boycott paralyzed all collective and cargo 
transporation nationwide 
there is nothing no buses have left and the terminal is 
empty said a dispatcher in one of san salvadors bus terminals 
we are 100 percent paralyzed the companies are stopped because 
nobody wants their equipment destroyed the dispatcher said 
guerrillas have been bombing power lines and utility poles 
nightly 
the military has mounted a security operation for the election 
that includes air and land surveillance patrols nationwide 
according to the armed forces public information office seven 
guerrillas have died and eight government soldiers have been 
injured in incidents around the country since tuesday the rebel 
radio station venceremos said guerrillas killed eight soldiers

oscar arias of costa rica 
president jose napoleon duarte 63 who is dying of liver 
cancer will be the first elected salvadoran president to hand 
power to another elected civilian 
cristianis first task in his fiveyear term will be to convince 
the political opposition and international community that he is in 
charge arena opponents and even some party regulars say that 
cristiani is a front for business interests they also express 
concern about his partys connection to rightwing death squads 
arena was founded in 1981 by a cashiered army major and alleged 
deathsquad leader roberto daubisson who still is considered the 
partys leader the party has been linked to death squads which are 
blamed for up to half the 70000 deaths in the civil war 
daubisson and arena deny any connection to the death squads 
but the us has decided to continue supporting the salvadoran 
government unless death squad activity which has lessened in 
recent years resumes in full force the united states pumps more 
than 1 million daily into el salvador in economic and military

a private judge has been hired to consider a 
settlement offer in the palimony lawsuit filed by actress sondra 
locke against movie tough guy clint eastwood a newspaper reported 
wednesday 
neither side has disclosed the name of the judge or where the 
closed hearing will be held but the los angeles times said 
attorneys for the stars were to go before the judge wednesday

legally married to another man offered a settlement that included 
a belair home the couple shared a hollywood hills house eastwood 
was said to have bought for miss locke and her husband sculptor 
gordon anderson monthly payments of as much as 15000 for the 
next seven years and a 250000 onetime payment

a hearing the newspaper reported 
since the wait for trial in civil lawsuits filed in los angeles 
county is routinely three to five years many litigants are turning 
to private arbitration or to rentajudge firms the wait for a 
judge is about a month and many disputes are settled in a matter of 
hours also for those seeking to keep their trial proceedings

commercial banks must do more soon to help 
third world countries reduce their debts the head of the 
international monetary fund said wednesday in echoing comments of 
the bush administration 
imf managing director michel camdessus in some of his toughest 
comments on the subject told a gathering of bankers in paris that 
the time has come for the large internatinal banks to increase 
their contribution to the debt reduction program unveiled by 
treasury secretary nicholas brady on march 10 
it is urgent to set the strategy in motion without delay 
camdessus said in a speech to the french bankers association the 
text of his remarks was released in washington 
the brady plan encourages banks to forgive a substantial portion 
of their loans to heavily indebted countries such as mexico in 
return for guarantees that the rest will be repaid 
those guarantees are to be furnished by the imf and its sister 
international lending agency the world bank 
camdessus said that lengthy negotiations between commerical 
banks and the debtor countries over terms would jeopardize the 
whole strategy given the perilous economic conditions facing many 
of the debtor countries 
camdessus remarks echoed statments made last week by treasury 
undersecretary david c mulford who blamed the slow pace in 
getting the debt reduction effort under way on footdragging by the 
banks 
if the banks fail to cooperate mulford said they could face 
the grim prospect that the debtor nations might decide to stop 
paying on their loans an impasse between the banks and debtor 
nations could trigger a legislated or mandated solution to the 
problem that may be very much more unpleasant for the banks 
mulford warned 
commercial banks have complained that they cant accept major 
reductions in principal and interest payments because they are not 
being offered sufficient financial incentives to do so by the imf 
and the world bank 
but in his paris speech camdessus said that the banks needed to 
give up the illusion that delay in reaching agreement on debt 
reduction proposals being made by the heavily indebted countries 
will force an increase in the amount the imf and other public 
agencies are willing to contribute toward debt reduction 
the imf is not equipped to do more camdessus said adding 
that for the brady approach to succeed it would need equal efforts 
on the part of creditor and debtor countries the commercial banks 
and the international lending organizations such as the imf 
each of the four partners must reconsider its methods and its 
contribution to the common goal he said we shall not succeed 
if any one of these parties chooses to skimp on its contribution or 
hopes to obtain from any of the other three a reduction of its fair 
share of the burden 
major commercial banks are preparing for a meeting in madrid on 
june 7 where they hope to learn more details about what government 
incentives they can expect if they agree to write off a portion of 
the 12 trillion in third world debt 
the sessions will be attended by brady camdessus and e gerald 
corrigan president of the federal reserve bank of new york

what may be one of the best jobs on the east coast 
was uncovered recently when boston edison co sought a rate 
increase budget documents revealed the chairmans chauffeur is 
paid 60000 a year 
not even donald trumps driver makes that much and hes been 
with the real estate tycoon for 10 years an aide said wednesday 
the chauffeurs salary is among the 185000 that the utility 
spent last year to provide company officials with cars and 
chauffeurs 
news of the expenditures comes as the company seeks an 85 
million rate increase or about 50 more per year from its 
customers 
its baffling how a company can cry poor and then take part in 
such wasteful spending and fancy perks said joseph kriesberg 
director of the citizens for safe energy which is fighting the 
increase 
for them to ask families some of whom are struggling to make 
ends meet to fork over an extra 50 a year to keep people who are 
making 300000 salaries in expensive cars and drivers is just 
inappropriate 
the 60177 income earned by the chauffeur for boston edison 
chairman and chief executive officer stephen j sweeney is well 
above the salaries of most limousine drivers according to boston 
limousine companies 
for a regular driver that does seem a little high said 
mario dangelo of mystic valley limousines where drivers are paid 
between 6 and 7 an hour and make the rest of their money in tips 
thats absurd said trumps executive assistant norma 
foerderer if a driver made half that it would be considered 
good id be willing to be a driver even trumps chauffeur makes 
less than 30000 she said 
edison defended the expenditures as executive compensation and 
said they were in line with industry standards and the fact is 
this is the first rate increase for the company in five years 
said spokesman mike monahan 
sweeney who earns 307500 per year is furnished with a 
24646 cadillac as well as a driver according to budget documents 
edison spokesman mike spataro said the 60177 is both salary 
and overtime but he would not give a breakdown he would not 
identify the chauffeur

visiting tourists and businessmen from the united states it was 
not clear which of the other countries participating in the program

the newly appointed premier wednesday 
named three cabinet ministers and fired four in a minor government 
shakeup the ruling nationalist party said 
the new 25member cabinet will be sworn in thursday officials 
said 
lee huan on tuesday replaced 75yearold yu kuohwa as taiwans 
premier yu who was premier for five years was criticized for his 
cautious approach to the countrys economic and political troubles 
he had been considered a political liability in upcoming 
parliamentary elections 
lee made only minor changes in the cabinet because he helped 
groom many of the incumbent ministers as ruling party 
secretarygeneral officals said 
clement chang speaker of the taipei city council was named 
minister of communications he replaces kuo nanhung who was made a 
minister without portfolio 
the new premier also fired two ministers without portfolios kao 
yushu and shen chunshan and named law professor chang chienhan 
to fill one of the vacancies the second post was not filled 
lees cabinet changes were unanimously approved by both 
president lee tenghui and by the nationalist partys policymaking 
committee the party also appointed james soong 47 to succeed lee 
as secretarygeneral 
lee 72 was secretarygeneral of the nationalist party from 
1987 until his appointment as premier his reformist approach is 
popular with the public and party officials expect this to benefit 
the nationalists in december elections 
professor chang lingchen a political scientist at national 
taiwan university said lee can be expected to respond to public 
demands for a clearcut policy toward mainland china and tackle 
taiwans worsening labor pollution and economic problems 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war on mainland china claim they are the legitimate rulers 
of all china 
they have rejected any official contacts with the chinese 
communists but two years ago adopted a more lenient policy that 
has permitted taiwanese and chinese to exchange visits and trade 
through third countries

senate majority leader george mitchell called 
on president bush on wednesday to waive for a year a provision 
limiting ussoviet trade 
mitchell also said bush should consider permitting soviet entry 
into international economic organizations under specified 
conditions 
we should clearly indicate that if the soviet union will play 
by the rules we will welcome it into the game mitchell said 
the majority leader told the senate that the president by his 
proposal this week for mutual cuts in us and soviet forces in 
europe took a major step to address the apparently changed nature 
of soviet communism under president mikhail s gorbachev 
he called for a comprehensive american and nato strategy to 
seize upon change within the soviet union in order to enhance 
western security 
changing circumstances require clear direction and not just a 
reactive or improvised course of action mitchell said 
he said that a symbolic but important first step would be for 
bush to waive the jacksonvanik amendment which was imposed in 1974 
to prohibit us trade concessions until moscow permits free 
immigration of jews and other minority groups 
the legislation was sponsored by the late sen henry m jackson 
dwash and former rep charles vanik dohio 
addressing himself to the president mitchell said i urge him 
to use his authority to waive jacksonvanik for a year thereby 
helping to normalize economic relations and expand the 
possibilities for trade 
he noted that soviet emigration is rising and that the soviet 
government is moving toward legal changes to institutionalize free 
emigration 
now is an appropriate time for the united states to respond to 
change we have sought for more than a decade mitchell said we 
can affirm and encourage further openness within the soviet union 
mitchell said bush should build on that step by stating plainly 
that if the soviet union is able to decentralize its economy and 
institute market mechanisms then the united states would look 
positively upon soviet entry into western economic organizations 
including the world bank and the international monetary fund 
mitchell also said the administration should move quickly in 
negotiations aimed at achieving deep cuts in strategic nuclear arms 
it would be a great loss if we failed to capitalize on the 
opportunity to reduce the far larger strategic arsenals and to 
stabilize the nuclear balance mitchell said

the department of health and human services 
gave a tepid reception wednesday to bills aimed at helping to 
alleviate the nursing shortage by allowing nurses from other 
countries to remain in the united states after their visas expire 
it is unclear to us how much benefit will be gained by the 
various immigration proposals that are before this committee dr 
j jarrett clinton told members of the house judiciary committees 
subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law 
clinton is director of the departments bureau of health 
professions 
the subcommittee was hearing testimony on a bill introduced by 
rep charles schumer dny that would create a new visa category 
for foreign nurses whose visas are on the brink of expiring the 
subcommittee was also looking into portions of a broader bill 
introduced by rep gary ackerman dny 
schumer said he was worried about thousands of filipino nurses 
in new york city hospitals many hold visas which allowed them to 
stay in the country for five years last year the immigration and 
naturalization service extended those visas for one more year but 
schumers bill would create a new immigration category to enable 
the nurses to become us residents 
rep bruce morrison dconn subcommittee chairman pressured 
clinton to outline the administrations policy on these nurses 
noting that the department sent a representative to the hearing 
with great reluctance 
were not seeing the leadership we need morrison said we 
would like to know more about where hhs is going in the overall 
planning and what role foreign nurses play in the long run so 
that our immigration policy can be integrated with other policies 
but clinton downplayed the problem of foreign nurses noting 
that of some 16 million registered nurses working in the united 
states perhaps 16000 are working under visas like those of the 
new york city nurses 
it looks to me like less than 1 percent and we have to decide 
whether its worth the energy it takes he said 
james puleo assistant commissioner of adjudications and 
nationality in the immigration and naturalization service said his 
agency found the schumer bill too generous in its requirements 
for special immigrant status 
stephen h cooper vice president of the hospital association of 
new york state said schumers bill is important to american 
nurses 
without foreign nurses our already overextended nurses would 
be unable to cope he said in prepared remarks

president bush told cheering germans 
on wednesday that the time is right to make europe whole and 
free and he called on soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to open 
up the rusting iron curtain 
the president did not directly endorse the reunification of 
germany but he renewed a demand that the berlin wall be dismantled 
the world has waited long enough bush declared we seek 
selfdetermination for all of germany and all of eastern europe we 
will not relax we must not waver 
the president flew to london for a private evening meeting with 
prime minister margaret thatcher after a day in west germany 
arranged for maximum publicity 
the events included a colorful cruise on the rhine river and a 
visit to ambassador vernon walters home where hundreds of 
american children whose parents work in the country were assembled 
to wave paper flags and cheer the president 
but the centerpiece was clearly the speech in mainz showing the 
confidence that marked his performance earlier in the week at a 
nato summit meeting in brussels bush challenged the soviet union 
to dismantle the barbed wiretopped wall erected 28 years ago to 
divide the old german capital 
throwing gorbachevs use of the term glasnost or openness 
back at the soviet leader he said berlin should be a place of 
cooperation not a point of confrontation 
as he did during a visit to bonn as vice president in june 1987 
bush in mainz called for expanded air access to berlin and the 
staging of more international meetings and sports events there 
bush said as minefields and barbedwire fences are being removed 
between hungary and austria so must they fall through eastern 
europe 
he added let berlin be next 
the crowd assembled in a hall in this rhineland city vigorously 
applauded every reference to erasing the division of europe that 
followed the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii 
he praised germany as a cradle of democracy made no reference 
to the war or its atrocities and said 
the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever the world 
has waited long enough the time is right let europe be whole and 
free 
in contrast bush gave the crowd at the ambassadors residence a 
brief campaignstyle speech 
i hope what happened in nato guarantees the future he said 
of the decision taken by the 16 allied governments tuesday to 
challenge gorbachev with a new proposal for reductions in troops 
tanks artillery and combat aircraft 
bush has called for completion of a conventional forces 
agreement within a year but secretary of state james a baker iii 
acknowledged on wednesday that the timetable may be too optimistic 
a lot is going to depend quite frankly on the soviet 
response baker said the ball now is clearly in their court 
warsaw pact representatives at the vienna arms reduction talks 
were upbeat wednesday about bushs proposals the way is open for 
a comprehensive agreement on the most destabilizing military 
units said hungarian ambassador david meiszter 
on air force one en route to london bush said he thought his 
west german visit had gone well in part because of the 
justcompleted nato agreement smoothing over uswest german 
differences on shortrange nuclear weapons he said he had arrived 
on an encouraging note 
still signs of the disagreement remained 
in mainz mayor hermanhartmut weyel indirectly criticized bush 
for steering nato into a proposal for reductions but not 
elimination of the weapons most of which are on german soil the 
mayor handed walters a resolution adopted by the city council that 
said we in mainz know there is no escape for us if these weapons 
are ever used 
about 250 demonstrators protested bushs speech waving placards 
reading bush go home and bush is not welcome here police 
sealed off the main bridge spanning the rhine and helicopters 
circled the hall where bush spoke 
in his speech bush said europe is undergoing a second 
renaissance in which the forces of freedom are putting the soviet 
status quo on the defensive 
he said the west is succeeding while on the other side of the 
rusting iron curtain their vision failed 
although his stance toward the soviets was combative he also 
offered an assurance that our goal is not to undermine their 
legitimate security interests 
in midafternoon trailed by television cameras and 
photographers bush and his wife barbara took a riverboat ride to 
koblenz where he was greeted by fireboats shooting streams of water 
high into the air 
at oberwesel local wine queen ute port dressed as a medieval 
damsel presented bush with a huge goblet of rhine riesling 
confiding that the literal translation of her title of weinhexe is 
wine witch she said the presidents eyes opened wide when i 
told him that

gordon a miami beach democrat said at the unveiling gordon who 
has served in the senate since 1972 is considered a potential 
successor to his longtime friend 
sen ileana roslehtinen a miami republican said pepper had 
always been a friend to miamis cuban community and other refugee 
groups 
he did not worry about color he did not worry about party he 
did not worry about creed said sen carrie meek a miami 
democrat 
gov bob martinez urged the legislature to name the states new 
department of education building for pepper 
it would be fitting to name this important building in state

surgeon general c everett koop standing on a 
stage wednesday with ads featuring beerpromoting dog spuds 
mackenzie and miller lite beach parties called for restrictions on 
alcohol advertising to help curb drunken driving 
koop urged congress to support the effort and also proposed much 
tougher state bloodalcohol standards to determine when a driver is 
legally drunk increased taxes on all alcoholic beverages and a 
series of voluntary restraints from the industry and advertising 
media 
the recommendations which arose from a conference koop 
organized in december to combat drunken driving brought immediate 
protests from distillers and the national association of 
broadcasters a spokesman for anheuserbusch said the proposals 
would dramatically increase government intrusion into our lives 
without stopping alcohol abuse 
koop in what he said would be his last news conference before 
leaving office july 13 said he did not support bans on or 
prohibition of alcohol advertising but he did ask for some 
advertising restrictions and bans on some promotional efforts 
involving alcoholic products 
he proposed that alcohol advertising be matched with prohealth 
and safety messages financed by the industry or by federal and 
state government if necessary tax deductions for alcohol 
advertising promotions other than price and product advertising 
should be eliminated he said 
pointing to ads featuring budweisers wellknown spuds mackenzie 
and miller lite beer beach parties koop said these practices 
tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to athletic social 
and sexual success 
stephen lambright a spokesman for anheuserbusch which produces 
budweiser said the dog ads have been used extensively to promote 
responsible drinking he said the overall market for beer has been 
flat for several years and denied that budweiser aims its ads at 
young people or tries to encourage people to drink who dont 
already imbibe 
beer prices would double under koops proposals lambright said 
fa meister president of the distilled spirits council said 
the surgeon generals panel was trying to solve drunken driving by 
eliminating drinking rather than working to make drunken driving 
socially unacceptable 
with this type of misguided mindset its impossible to 
develop sound effective solutions said meister who represents 
liquor marketers and manufacturers 
national association of broadcasters president edward o fritts 
said despite all scientific evidence finding no link between 
advertising and abuse the surgeon generals report nonetheless 
would place restrictions on the right to advertise alcoholic 
beverages which are legal products the organization represents 
5100 radio stations 970 television stations and major networks 
fritts said broadcasters contribute 1 billion a year in air 
time and community services against drug and alcohol abuse 
koop also recommended extending a law signed by former president 
reagan last year that for the first time required health warning 
labels on alcoholic beverages but he added that mainly he was 
urging voluntary action on the part of advertisers 
please enlarge the warning labels required on bottles and cans 
beginning this november he said even a person my age should 
be able to read the warning without using a magnifying glass 
the surgeon general urged an end to happy hours and other 
pricecutting promotions at bars aimed at increasing consumption 
these actions may not make people as happy as happy hours do 
but they will help keep them alive koop said 
he also asked the industry to stop advertising on college 
campuses and at public events attended by young people to 
eliminate sponsorship of athletic events and to end the use of 
celebrities who appeal to youth in alcohol advertising 
nearly 25000 people died from alcoholrelated vehicle crashes 
last year koop said with another 534000 injured about half of 
all vehicle fatalities involve alcohol according to the national 
transportation safety board 
koop said states should reduce the level of bloodalcohol 
content that determines drunken driving from its usual level of 
010 percent to 004 percent by the year 2000 he said a level of 0 
percent should be set for drivers under 21 
koop advocated legislation in each state that would allow the 
confiscation of drivers licenses on the spot for those who fail to 
pass blood alcohol tests 
excise taxes on alcoholic beverages should be increased and 
taxes on beer wine and distilled spirits should be based on their 
alcohol content he said 
he recommended that states consider a minimum 5centadrink tax 
increase on alcoholic beverages 
after all who would quarrel with a nickel a drink user fee 
that will generate billions of dollars to help save lives he 
asked

police in helicopters fired guns and 
tossed tear gas canisters at demonstrators wednesday as the rioters 
erected barricades and set government vehicles on fire 
independent reports said 19 people including two who died 
were brought to ikeja general hospital with gunshot wounds there 
was no official comment on the riots 
the clashes were the most violent in the capital since students 
began rioting a week ago to protest a government austerity plan and 
school policies 
wednesdays demonstrations began when the government ordered two 
lagos universities and four technical schools closed to protect 
life and property in the port city 
students took to the streets and witnesses said market women 
and unemployed youth helped them erect barricades around government 
buildings to stop civil servants from going to work workers who 
managed to enter the buildings later were chased away by the 
rioters 
by noon the streets of the sprawling city were full of rioters 
including schoolchildren and traders who closed their stores 
police tried to disperse the demonstrators who chanted slogans 
against president ibrahim babangidas economic policies and pelted 
officers with stones but when they were chased from the streets 
officers used helicopters to fire on the rioters 
the staterun daily times newspaper said troops will guard all 
strategic installations in the country against demonstrators 
the protests began on may 24 at universities in the midwestern 
city of benin about 160 miles east of lagos and since have spread 
to campuses nationwide 
the government has closed 13 schools and police have arrested 
more than 200 students in benin and lagos alone according to 
newspaper reports at least six people including a police officer 
have been reported killed 
the protesters oppose a government austerity program demanded by 
western creditors the program has caused sharp rises in the price 
of some basic foods and services 
some students also have demanded changes in nigerias university 
system including the abolition of tuition fees 
the daily times quoted col fred chijuka an army spokesman as 
saying that students alone were not responsible for the riots 
the act cannot be the handiwork of students but hooligans in 
the guise of students he said 
in ibadan north of lagos oyo state police commissioner 
archibong nkana said police were investigating the death of a 
secondary school pupil who allegedly was shot to death during a 
demonstration monday at the university of ibadan the news agency 
of nigeria reported 
nkana said the shot could not have been fired by any of his men 
because they were not armed with guns nan said

the bush administration reaffirmed on 
wednesday that it wants to strengthen the noncommunist 
resistance in cambodia as it refused to deny a report that it will 
seek congressional support for a covert program supplying weapons 
to the guerrillas 
there has been opposition on capitol hill to such a move on the 
grounds such support could fall into the hands of the communist 
khmer rouge 
led by pol pot the khmer rouge ran cambodia from 1975 through 
1978 and presided over the period in which 1 million cambodians 
died 
state department richard boucher asked about the report 
published in the new york times said the united states has an 
assistance program for the noncommunist groups that seeks an 
acceptable comprehensive and stable political solution in 
cambodia 
we believe it is important to strengthen the cambodian 
noncommunist resistance boucher said adding the administration 
believes this is important in light of vietnams announcement that 
it intends to withdraw its forces from cambodia at the end of 
september 
the spokesman said appropriate assistance would strengthen 
the noncommunist resistance and enhance its position and that of 
prince sihanouk who is trying to oust the phnom penh government 
and its vietnamese backers the princes forces are part of a 
coalition of armed groups that includes the khmer rouge 
asked if that meant whether he could rule out military aid as a 
way of strengthening the noncommunist resistance boucher replied 
i have nothing here that would rule it out no 
boucher said the administration was unalterably opposed to a 
return to power by the khmer rouge 
the new york times reported on wednesday that the covert aid 
program would be used to strengthen sihanouks position in 
negotiations with the phnom penh government and the khmer rouge 
the newspaper attributed the report to unidentified bush 
administration officials but efforts to confirm the report were 
unsuccessful

the communist party leadership said 
wednesday that former premier imre nagy who led the failed 1956 
antisoviet uprising has become the symbol of reform and a 
significant figure in postwar history 
the reversal of official policy on nagy who was executed in 
1958 amounted to political rehabilitation 
it comes just two weeks before his remains are to be reburied at 
an officially sanctioned ceremony june 16 in the same spot where 
his body and those of his associates were dumped in unmarked graves 
31 years ago 
nagy is a significant figure of hungarian post1945 history 
said a party statement read on hungarian tv 
he fought to stop stalinism in hungary and against foreign 
intervention and against the counterrevolutionary actions taking 
place during the uprising it said 
until earlier this year nagy was said to not have taken steps 
to combat the counterrevolutionaries involved in the 1956 
uprising 
in february the party partially reassessed its view of the 
revolt admitting that it began as a popular uprising 
the statement drafted by a central committee panel headed by 
politburo reformer rezsoe nyers further reassessed the uprising 
during the 1956 events in the midst of the contradictory 
circumstances on both sides of the opposing forces many fought 
heroically and died for causes they believed to be just it said 
the tragedy was the fratricide itself and all of the dead are 
a loss to the nation it said 
mass demonstrations began oct 23 1956 for political reforms 
and withdrawal of soviet military forces soviet soldiers and tanks 
rolled into budapest on nov 4 to end the uprising 
official figures said 50006000 people were killed but 
western estimates put the number at 32000 
at a meeting this week the party central committee agreed that 
nagy was executed in the wake of a show trial and that his 
sentence was a violation of the law party spokesman laszlo major 
told reporters tuesday 
last week official media said june 16 would be a day of 
mourning in hungary for nagy and his fellow martyrs

the british broadcasting corp said wednesday that 
scottish police were convinced the bomb that blew up pan am flight 
103 over lockerbie scotland killing 270 people was put on board 
the plane at frankfurt airport 
it also indicated detectives thought one passenger a student 
checked in the suitcase containing the bomb for someone else 
perhaps innocently and intimated that west german authorities were 
hindering the investigation 
the scots now think they know whose baggage the bomb was in 
the case containing the bomb is now firmly believed to have been 
loaded at frankfurt airport the bbc said 
police refused to comment 
but john boyd chief constable of dumfries and galloway who has 
led the lockerbie investigation said the investigation was now at 
a stage police had not envisioned when they started 
that means that i am hopeful and optimistic for a reasonable 
conclusion said boyd who is moving to a new post as chief 
investigator of constabulary for scotland 
john prescott transport spokesman for the opposition labor 
party urged prime minister margaret thatcher to discuss the issue 
with president bush who arrived in london wednesday night at the 
end of his european tour 
if the german security authorities are hindering the inquiries 
by the british and the americans then something must be done to 
stop that prescott said 
the pan am flight originated in frankfurt west germany and 
blew up over lockerbie on dec 21 while bound from london to new 
york killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
no arrests in the bombing have been announced but on may 22 the 
west german magazine stern said an arab bomb expert linked to the 
sabotage was arrested in october with 15 other people in raids on 
palestinian homes that also netted explosives and weapons 
stern identified the man as jordanianborn marwan khreesat it 
said he was released 15 days later because he worked for the west 
german intelligence service and then returned to jordan 
a spokesman for the service denied the man was a west german 
agent 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for west germanys chief 
federal prosecutors office said may 22 that investigators could 
not find enough evidence to keep khreesat in custody despite 
suspicions about him 
stern said khreesat was believed to make bombs for the radical 
arab group popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral

years ago before he was speaker of the house 
james claude wright wrote an affirmation to himself on three 
pieces of scratch paper and vowed to carry it always by now the 
words are surely faded if not soiled 
no person can take from me my inner peace for i shall 
quietly calmly gently pleasantly hold onto it for it is mine 
a gift of god 
i shall be open to new things new thoughts new truths that i 
can learn from other people i have performed well in the past and 
i fully expect success in the future 
i deserve to have happiness career success and economic 
security the lord wants me to have them because i like and 
respect myself i am not adversely affected by the attitudes of 
others if they think they do not like me it is because they do 
not know me 
now jim wright of texas the second most powerful man in 
government most powerful in the democratic party is leaving his 
beloved congress not just adversely affected but laid bare by 
others foes and friends alike whose shared farewell is a sigh of 
relief 
he brought himself down perhaps by failing to abide by that 
pledge to learn new truths namely those arising from profound 
changes in political morality since he came to congress in an era 
of texas bosses and cronies or perhaps his colleagues and the 
nation failed to know him to truly hear him out until it was far 
too late to correct the damage to his credibility and reputation 
that can be argued for years 
eighteen months ago wright merely laughed when rep newt 
gingrich rga began raising cain over reports that the new 
speaker had promoted bulk sales of his book an unscintillating 
compendium of speeches to escape house limits on outside income 
nor did wright seem to perceive any basis for concern over the 
subsequent allegation that he accepted gifts worth 145000 
involving an essentially nowork job for his wife from a texas 
developer friend 
but his world had virtually crashed down upon him by the time he 
rose on the floor of the house late thursday in solemn defense of 
his honor and especially that of wife betty and despite what he 
portrayed as a thorough rebuttal of all the charges he asked in 
tears to give you back this job you gave to me as a 
propitiation for all of this season of bad will 
i dont want to be a party to tearing up this institution 
he said i love it im not a bitter man im a lucky man 
god bless this institution god bless the united states 
he quoted horace greeley fame is a vapor popularity is an 
accident riches take wings those who cheer today may curse 
tomorrow only one thing endures character 
wright as his affirmation suggested did yearn for a secure 
financial life something he didnt have for much of his adulthood 
even as a senior member of the house an abortive senate campaign 
in the 1960s the breakup of his first marriage and the needs of 
four children kept him seriously in debt 
he fell deeply in love with betty hay a longtime staff aide 
after he separated from his first wife mary ethelyn in 1970 but 
to bettys consternation he balked at remarrying because of that 
debt i thought i was doing the lady no favor he said 
she finally prevailed in 1972 i had to talk him into it 
she once recalled i said we can get out of debt we can make 
it and we did 
to this day wright 66 regularly writes romantic poetry to 
her anyone who has seen them together cooing like lovesick 
teenagers knows that his first loyalty is to her 
his salary and investments have put his assets well into six 
figures but wright does not live lavishly he still drives an 
aging chevrolet around washington and lives in the suburban mclean 
va house he bought in 1982 for 228000 a modest figure by 
washington standards 
what the scrappy bushybrowed wright truly burned for since 
arriving in the house 34 years ago was the speakership even if he 
had no illusions about its grandeur he once put it this way i 
had more raw power when i was mayor of weatherford than ive had in 
any job since 
there was the morning he was still in bed when an old woman 
called to complain to the mayor about the wicked little boys 
shooting bb guns at the songbirds in her yard barely had he hung 
up when another woman on the opposite side of town called to 
complain about all the sparrows roosting in her eaves wright drove 
to the first house picked up the boys and transported them to the 
second 
ever since i have yearned for some set of problems amenable 
to that kind of direct action he said you dont find those 
opportunities in the us congress 
perhaps but he never quit trying to find them months before 
his predecessor thomas p tip oneill jr of massachusetts 
stepped down as speaker in late 1986 wright told his colleagues he 
intended nothing less than to tip the balance between the 
legislative and executive branches back in favor of congress 
to some extent that has happened as ronald reagan abandoned 
one domestic initiative after another to congress in his last two 
years at the white house focusing instead on foreign policy and 
even this year embroiled as he was in his own difficulties wright 
and his colleagues have assumed a more equal role with president 
bush in formulating consensus policies over the budget and other 
key issues including latin america 
but republicans complained that within congress itself wright 
was even more partisan than his predecessor with tip there was 
warmth and affection said former rep richard cheney rwy now 
secretary of defense there are no such feelings for jim wright 
sen trent lott of mississippi former house republican whip 
said the house was being run by jim wright and his goons 
even though a 1981 poll by us news amp world report named wright 
as the most respected member of congress he has never lacked for 
detractors even among democrats they included reps dan 
rostenkowski of illinois and john dingell of michigan both of whom 
thought of challenging him for the speakership 
wright surely didnt rise to the leadership heights by the sheer 
force of personality unlike oneill he rarely unwound with his 
colleagues in the cloakrooms or the capitals night spots swapping 
stories and good whiskey 
instead he was a loner who while invariably cordial revealed 
little of himself and family oneill once said you dont have 
anecdotes about jim maybe thats an anecdote 
he is a far greater master of the language than oneill though 
his oratory usually begun with a calculated arch of his trademark 
eyebrows tends toward the tedious and never worked well on 
television 
wright tells the story about how a few years back he was 
growing more and more irritated with the progress of dingells 
energy committee on a complicated bill 
i was forever exhorting them id get impatient and say hey 
look times awastin this is an important problem and the united 
states has got to have a solution to this thing here you are 
sitting around here pecking out and dissecting and extruding to the 
mind the flaccid tissues of longdead issues offensive to god and 
mankind lets get on with it boys 
and finally john dingell said now glorious leader you 
have admonished us in approximately those same terms at least on 
five occasions i would suggest that if youre truly intent upon 
expediting the proceedings we should just designate that speech 
you just made as speech no 1 and whenever you feel impelled to 
exhort us to greater efforts just hold up one finger and well 
know its speech no 1 and it will save us a lot of time

despite wrights pledge to hold onto inner peace his temper is 
legion a former golden gloves boxer he once threatened to punch 
out rep dan lungren rcalif on the house floor when rep pete 
stark dcalif cursed at him wright promptly invited him outside 
to settle the issue 
wrights climb through the ranks was rooted more than anything 
else in sheer hard political work in the four years preceding 
his election as speaker he traveled to more than 250 congressional 
districts raising more than 1 million for candidates collecting 
chits 
his own political history runs the democratic gamut first 
parochial and populist then increasingly liberal he was one of a 
few southern congressmen who refused to sign a petition opposing 
the supreme courts 1954 desegregation decision but he voted 
against the 1964 civil rights act he evolved into a national 
democrat preaching fairness and help for the downtrodden but 
retaining a downhome interest in protecting banks and oil 
operators he favored a strong defense but led the fight against 
the mx missile and aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
craig raupe a former aide who died last october once said 
wright was as complicated as lyndon johnson just not as mean 
even gingrich was once something of a fan he makes everyone 
feel part of the institution the georgia republican said in 
1986 i remember asking him once for floor time he could have 
finessed me instead he took 30 minutes and gave me 30 minutes 
things like that if he does it draw 90 percent of the poison out 
of this place 
wright was born on dec 22 1922 in weatherford he father ran 
national trades day inc a profitable small business that 
specialized in arranging promotional gimmicks like sack races and 
pieeating contests for local merchants young jim was educated in 
the public schools for fort worth and dallas 
my goal he once said was to be a football coach but in 
my junior year in high school i injured my knee and the coach 
suggested that since i couldnt play football what they really 
needed was somebody to represent the school in debate and since he 
was also the world history teacher i was forever trying to impress 
him with how smart i was i got hooked 
at age 19 wright dropped out of the university of texas to 
become a b24 bomber pilot in the pacific where he won a 
distinguished flying cross and the legion of merit at age 23 he 
ran unopposed for the state legislature served as mayor of 
weatherford from 1951 to 1954 and at age 32 was a member of 
congress 
now 34 years later this is his darkest hour but he still has 
the light of his life betty to whom he wrote for their 14th 
christmas together 
youre the dearest truest part of every day i live 
the thought of you within my heart is all it takes to give 
me hope that i can work and learn and grow 
yet grateful be for i have more than any man i know 
for it is true in all i do 
it isnt i its we 
in all of this i do thank you 
for not giving up on me

neighborhood two days later she said she found her garbage can 
overturned and a fish skeleton on her doorstep later she said

words such as shimmery carnivore and 
hopperdozer flowed trippingly over the tongue wednesday but 
blas nasturtium and macadam proved too difficult as 
the 62nd national spelling bee winnowed out the best from the just 
very very good 
the record field of 222 local champions was cut by 71 in the 
first three rounds the 151 remaining will battle through more

bonner a 6th grader from fort necessity la high school spelled 
scordatura so softly that the judges had to replay a tape 
recording that officials use for such situations 
she waited nervously as the judges listened to the tape two or 
three times they finally decided she had misspelled the word by 
using a t instead of a d the word means tuning of an 
instrument to produce a special effect 
when 14yearold angela martin of st petersburg fla got the 
word boulevardier she asked several times to have the word 
repeated and then said oh god can i buy a vowel a steal 
from the game show wheel of fortune 
in this competition however there is no such help available 
tenyearold malinda shepherd of burnsville nc one of the 
youngest contestants was the first to be eliminated misspelling 
seriatim as seriatum the word means in a series 
malinda took advantage of contest rules that allow the speller 
to ask for a definition of the word then its use in a sentence 
and even what it is derived from she took her loss bravely and 
walked off the stage with a contest officials arm around her 
the twoday competition which carries 16350 in prize money 
has attracted 120 girls and 102 boys who survived elimination 
contests around the country and in american outposts abroad

the defense department citing an ongoing 
criminal case against former executives of borden inc has 
temporarily suspended the companys dairy division from doing any 
business with the federal government 
borden was informed of the action in a notice dated may 25 the 
pentagon announced wednesday adding the suspension will remain in 
place pending completion of legal proceedings 
the suspension is based upon adequate evidence to suspect that 
the employees engaged in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate 
competition by rigging bids for the award and performance of 
contracts to supply milk for school children in florida the 
pentagon said 
larry wilson a spokesman for the defense logistics agency said 
the criminal cases against the former borden executives originated 
in florida and did not involve contracts to provide milk to federal 
agencies 
however because of the nature of the allegations dividing 
up territory for bid rigging et cetera we just thought it was 
prudent to protect the governments interests until we do know if 
similar conduct occurred on our bids wilson said 
the dla spokesman said the defense department during the first 
six months of fiscal 1989 spent 45 million buying borden dairy 
products for military commissaries 
wilson also said the pentagon spent at least 700000 a year in 
the tampa and orlando areas of florida the florida cases involved 
former managers of borden plants in tampa and orlando 
borden executives in new york declined immediate comment 
wednesday on the pentagons announcement or the effect of the 
suspension on the business 
beyond the criminal cases the state of florida has recovered 
32 million from milk producers and distributors involved in what 
has been described as a 10year pricefixing scheme that resulted 
in overcharges for nearly half the states 67 school districts 
of that 32 million total a settlement of 104 million was 
paid by borden inc 
the pentagons suspension was based on the indictments of three 
former borden executives a lamar garrett jack parker tribble 
sr and lenard o jackson 
each of the men were charged in us district court in tampa 
with rigging bids and violating the sherman antitrust act 
under federal procurement regulations the department of defense 
has the authority to act as a socalled executive agent on behalf 
of the entire government when dealing with instances of contracting 
irregularities

parliament wednesday to take power and end 72 years of communist 
party rule he blamed the party and president mikhail s gorbachev 
for continuing economic decline 
yeltsin a member of the party leadership told fellow deputies 
of the congress of peoples deputies that the presidency is 
accumulating too much power and could become a dictatorship 
the congress must take power into its own hands if the 
political and economic restructuring begun by gorbachev is to 
succeed yeltsin said on the sixth day of the popularly elected 
parliaments inaugural session 
he called for an immediate transfer of authority from the party 
and suggested the president submit to an annual referendum on his 
performance 
the session broadcast live to the nation has seen 
unprecedented public criticism of the soviet leadership 
gorbachev kept a stoic face throughout yeltsins speech and 
scanned the hall for reaction most deputies politely applauded 
members of the partys ruling politburo who attended the session 
and sat in a special section of the hall did not clap 
gorbachevs performance of the past four years has been 
criticized since the congress convened and many deputies

take advantage of the increased powers of the presidency 
another deputy proposed constitutional amendments recognizing 
the 15 soviet republics as sovereign states with the power to 
control their own resources make their own laws and shape a new 
relationship with the kremlin 
estonia and lithuania which have defied the kremlin by 
declaring themselves sovereign with the right to overturn soviet 
laws had been expected to propose such amendments 
but the sponsor turned out to be a gorbachev protege latvian 
president anatoly gorbunov 
the ussr is a union a multinational state formed on the 
basis of agreement equal republics with selfdetermination of 
nations gorbunov said only the republics can delegate power 
to the union 
he said a redistribution of power was needed to eradicate the 
roots of ethnic tension 
gorbunov whispered with gorbachev during the following speech 
and conferred again during the next break but the president did 
not respond publicly to the proposal 
the highestlevel comment on gorbunovs radical proposals came 
from anatoly lukyanov elected monday as vice president he said 
the proposals may go too far and called for a combination of 
central republic and local control 
moscow deputy yuri vlasov ripped into gorbachev for denying 
knowledge of what happened when troops that were dispatched to 
break up a proindependence demonstration in tbilisi capital of 
soviet georgia killed 20 people 
in no circumstances is it possible to accept that the head of 
state doesnt know the circumstances of the case vlasov said 
otherwise what kind of head of state is he 
the congress on wednesday approved a commission to investigate 
the incident 
vlasov also criticized the longsacrosanct kgb secret police 
charging that the best people of the country were tortured in its 
basements and it remains almost uncontrollable continuing to 
dominate the lives of all citizens 
yeltsins speech was packed with proposals and his fellow 
deputies sat riveted to their seats when he demanded the congress 
seize power from party leaders who are the same people who have 
not managed to get society out of its crisis in politics the 
economy finances and the standard of living 
yeltsin who became a hero to many soviets by demanding a better 
life for the common people said the threat of financial collapse 
has become real since gorbachev was named kremlin leader in march 
1985 tens of millions of people live in poverty he said 
yeltsin proposed the congress grant free medicine and mass 
transit to invalids and the poor and suggested it convert special 
hospitals and clinics for the elite to health centers for mothers 
and children 
yeltsin a member of the partys central committee also called 
for removal of many of that policymaking bodys members saying 
they have proved incapable of solving the nations problems 
despite his harsh words for gorbachev yeltsins proposal on 
transferring power from the party to the government could have 
gorbachevs support deputy revaz tabakashvili said later 
gorbachev has said his reforms are designed to separate the 
government and party bureaucracies get the party out of daytoday 
public affairs and let the popularly elected congress and its 
fulltime legislature set policy and law with the guidance of a 
strong president 
one deputy noted that gorbachev chose wednesdays speakers 
including yeltsin from among the 440 deputies who asked to comment 
on gorbachevs address on tuesday 
since gorbachev heads the party and the government he would not 
be threatened by yeltsins proposal but thousands of party 
bureaucrats in every organization in the country from a tiny 
siberian factory to the ruling politburo could stand to lose power 
vice president lukyanov told reporters afterward i think the 
partys position in our country is just fine and precisely defined 
in article 6 of the constitution 
the article says the communist party is the leading and 
guiding force of soviet society and the nucleus of its political 
system

spotlight after a memorial day visit from fbi agents wrote an 
angry letter wednesday to the justice department demanding a probe 
of news leaks 
attorney general dick thornburgh assured the fourthranking 
house democrat that he had ordered a full investigation into 
leaks saying the fbi had begun a preliminary probe into allegations 
that gray may have had a ghost employee on his payroll 
jon plebani grays staff director said wednesday every 
employee who works for bill gray comes to work and does work hes 
a very demanding boss 
gray is seeking the post of majority whip being vacated by rep 
tony coelho dcalif in his letter to thornburgh gray questioned 
why the department waited until the eve of democratic leadership 
changes to inform me or ask my cooperation 
rep david e bonior dmich one of grays opponents in the 
whips race also complained the american people are fed up with 
the effort to use innuendoes and rumors to discredit our public 
officials we must stop this destructive politics of character 
assassination 
government sources told several news organizations tuesday that 
gray had been visited by fbi agents who were conducting a 
preliminary inquiry gray denied that he had done anything wrong 
and suggested in an evening news conference tuesday that the 
allegations were politically motivated 
i was told over and over again i was not the subject of an 
investigation gray said he said hed been told that the bureau 
was looking into allegations about an employee or employees 
gray wrote a sharply worded letter to thornburgh demanding an 
independent investigation of the source of any leak thornburgh 
responded prior to receiving your letter i had ordered a full 
investigation of the apparent unauthorized disclosure of 
information in this matter 
the purpose of the investigation thornburgh said is to 
uncover any possible wrongdoing within the department or elsewhere 
and to prevent such leaks in the future 
in philadelphia fbi spokesman john kundts said wednesday that 
the bureau would not confirm nor deny that there is an 
investigation under way 
justice department spokesman david runkel disputed suggestions 
that top department officials leaked information for political 
reasons 
if that is going on its going on at a lower level of the 
department runkel said 
the spokesman described thornburgh as disturbed by leaks that 
have come out of the department concerning matters which have led 
to news stories on members of congress 
if there is some attempted interference here in the actions of 
the house democratic caucus it is of concern to us runkel said 
last thursday the attorney general asked assistant attorney 
general edward sg dennis to look into the unauthorized 
disclosure of information leading to stories that coehlo and los 
angeles mayor tom bradley were being investigated by the fbi 
the los angeles times reported last week that the fbi was 
conducting a preliminary inquiry into investments that coelho and 
bradley made through the investment firm of drexel burnham and 
lambert

actor demond wilson testified wednesday that 
slain movie producer roy radin feared there might be some 
trouble on the night he disappeared because of radins ties with 
the film the cotton club 
on may 13 1983 radin assigned wilson former star of tvs 
sanford and son to follow him with a gun as the producer 
headed for a business dinner at a swanky beverly hills restaurant 
wilson said 
wilsons testimony came in a preliminary hearing in the cotton 
club case in municipal court to determine if four people should 
stand trial for the abductionslaying of radin 
he asked me to follow and just watch and see if anything 
happened wilson said he said that there might be some 
trouble he said that something might happen to him as a result of 
his association with the the cotton club 
wilson who acknowledged that he had drug habit at the time 
said he lost radins limousine in traffic on sunset boulevard and 
never saw him again 
the 33yearold new york businessmans body was found a month 
later in a dry riverbed about 65 miles north of los angeles he had 
been shot in the head repeatedly 
wilsons testimony conflicted with that of his former secretary 
who testified earlier that she was with wilson and saw radin pull 
off the boulevard followed by another car full of men but said she 
and wilson did not follow 
under questioning wilson said he used cocaine alcohol and 
pills in 1983 asked by an attorney whether he underwent a drug 
rehabilitation program he said no sir i found christ 
wilson is now an evangelical preacher in washington dc 
defense attorneys attacked wilsons account of radins last 
night saying the actor never before told anyone that radin 
expressed fear 
he was pretty fearful wilson insisted there was a lot of 
anxiety around him it was not a fear that somebodys hands 
were shaking its something that a friend knows 
deputy district attorney sally thomas had wilson describe his 
friendship with radin and the last night the producer was seen 
alive 
the prosecution contends that reputed drug dealer karen delayne 
laynie greenberger arranged radins murder after they fought 
about her share of profits from the cotton club she is charged 
with murder along with alex lamota marti william molony mentzer 
and robert ulmer lowe former bodyguards for hustler magazine 
publisher larry flynt lowe is fighting extradition in maryland 
on the night radin disappeared wilson said he visited radin in 
his hotel suite and that was when i saw the crux of his anxiety 
he said radin asked if he had a gun which wilson did and 
arranged for him to come along to la scala restaurant where radin 
was to dine with mrs greenberger wilson was assigned to follow in 
his own car the actor said he offered to call the police but 
radin declined 
wilson brought his secretary and also had a reservation for 
dinner but he said the plan went awry when he lost radins 
limousine in traffic 
he said he began to follow but got stopped at a red traffic 
light by the time he turned onto sunset boulevard he said he was 
about 10 cars behind radin 
he said he continued on to the restaurant but radin never 
showed up 
attorney david kenner representing marti attacked wilsons 
story pointing out discrepancies between his current account and 
what he told police in interviews following radins disappearance 
kenner then asked do you have a recollection of telling 
anybody before today that mr radin was expressing fear 
nervousness or anxiety on may 13 1983 
no said wilson

the senate approved legislation wednesday 
aimed at encouraging television networks local stations and cable 
systems to reduce graphic depictions of violence drug use and sex 
on tv 
the bill by sen paul simon dill was approved on a voice 
vote after an amendment by sen jesse helms rnc was adopted to 
include depictions of sexual acts in addition to drug use and 
violence in any guidelines the industry might develop 
technically the bill only exempts the industry from antitrust 
claims that might result from joint efforts to develop the 
guidelines but its passage was clearly aimed at sending a signal 
to the industry that some depictions of violence and sex have 
become too graphic 
network executives did not embrace the measure but they also did 
not try to stop it the american civil liberties union however 
opposed it as a step toward censorship and a threat to first 
amendment rights of free speech

the united states accused romania at an eastwest 
human rights conference wednesday of repressing and driving away 
thousands of people but romania told other nations to keep out of 
its internal affairs 
earlier in the day turkey appealed to the conference to help 
ethnic turks who have been subject to an assimilation campaign in 
bulgaria 
romania and bulgaria are expected to be singled out as nations 
that routinely violate human rights by the monthlong 35nation 
conference on the human dimension which began tuesday in paris it 
is being held in the framework of the eastwest helsinki accords on 
human rights 
us chief delegate morris b abram told delegates that more 
than 20000 people had fled romania in the past 18 months to escape 
political and economic repression he said romania now turns its 
back on the human rights commitments it made with other nations 
romania has come under heavy criticism from nations including 
hungary its communist bloc neighbor for a program to destroy 
thousands of villages populated by ethnic hungarians and resettle 
their populations in industrial centers 
however constantin ene chief of romanias delegation said the 
delegates should ignore their mandate to examine specific cases of 
human rights abuse 
he said such a process would interfere with a nations 
sovereignty i want to underline that the domestic and foreign 
policies of romania are decided in bucharest and not in just any 
capital he said 
challenging ene abram told reporters at a news conference 
sovereignty does not give a state a right to oppress its own 
citizens 
an emigre source said a leading romanian dissident doina 
cornea was beaten and kicked by romanian police for the second 
time this month when she tried to leave home may 18 
mihnea berindei a spokesman for the parisbased romanian league 
of human rights told the associated press in vienna austria that 
it was not known if cornea was allowed to receive medical treatment 
in a hospital 
emigre sources said the dissident was also beaten earlier this 
month and told she would not receive a visa to attend the human 
rights conference in paris 
turkish foreign minister mesut yilmaz said ethnic turks face 
irradication as a national minority in bulgaria he called 
bulgarias assimilation campaign one of the gravest human rights 
violations of our time 
bulgaria started the drive in 1984 forcing ethnic turks to 
change their moslem names to slavic ones and forbidding use of the 
turkish language and islamic worship 
bulgaria has said three people were killed over the weekend in 
rioting by ethnic turks turkish emigres sources say up to 30 
people died 
some ethnic turks at the paris conference say bulgaria is 
imprisoning torturing exiling or killing those who resist 
assimilation 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international says 
about 100 turks died fighting the campaign and thousands were 
jailed 
bulgarian president todor zhivkov has blamed the charges on a 
campaign of slander by turkey and western groups 
also wednesday bulgarian exile sources said a union leader who 
planned to attend the paris conference was arrested may 26 
the sources in austria and west germany said konstantin 
trenchev chairman of an independent trade union of intellectual 
workers faces charges that could jail him for up to 15 years

the senate voted wednesday to continue 
subsidizing local freight railroad lines that otherwise would be 
abandoned because of little traffic 
as a budgetreducing measure president bush had called for 
ending the 16yearold subsidy program once the 10 million 
appropriated for this year was spent 
but on a voice vote with no dissent the senate approved a bill 
by sen tom harkin diowa to continue the program with the intent 
of providing some 50 million in new aid through 1993 
however the new legislation increases from 30 percent to 40 
percent the local share required for federal matching funds to 
acquire and repair tracks and terminal facilities none of the 
federal aid can be used to subsidize the operating costs of the 
lines 
the program originated in the governments bailout of the penn 
central railroad in the early 1970s when shippers and local 
communities were faced with the prospect that thousands of miles of 
track would be abandoned it was expanded nationwide in 1976

two cracks discovered in the hull of a nearly 
completed nuclear submarine stem from a failure of the steel 
manufacturer and went undetected by navy officials and the ships 
builder for five years the submarine builder said wednesday 
the electric boat division of general dynamics corp which 
described the cracks in a memo to lawmakers last week as quite 
severe said repairs have been completed and apparently would not 
impact on the sept 30 commissioning date of the uss topeka a 
ssn688 los angeles class attack submarine 
electric boat spokesman neil ruenzel said metallurgical tests 
conducted by the groton conn sub maker showed that the steel 
plate in question developed a defect during the manufacturing 
process 
the steel maker armco inc of parsippany nj initiated 
repairs but did not completely eliminate the defect in this 
plate when they made the repair electric boat said in a 
statement 
the cracks were present prior to or during heat treatment 
following the repair while it is not uncommon for a vendor to 
correct defects in steel plate used in submarine construction it 
is rare that cracks remain after this repair electric boat said 
the cracks were on the area that had undergone repairs ruenzel 
said 
jim herzog a spokesman for armco said the steel maker would 
withhold comment until it receives electric boats report on the 
findings that report had not been received by the end of business 
wednesday he said 
the steel plate was manufacturered by armcos houston plant and 
delivered in 1984 herzog said the electric boat order was among 
the last for the houston plant before it was shut down he said 
ruenzel when asked how the cracks could have gone undetected by 
company and navy inspectors for five years said it could have 
gotten bigger over time i think thats the best explanation 
navy and company officials refused to describe the cracks 
saying the information was classified but the hartford courant 
reported that one was a 2inch long hairline crack and the other 
was smaller 
the cracks were discovered by a foreman during preparation for 
painting the hull at the groton shipyard 
ruenzel said it was not immediately known how much the repairs 
cost electric boat the question of liability would be addressed in 
the future he said

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
announced wednesday a required 5 percent acreage reduction and 
several other provisions of the 1990 wheat program 
we need more wheat said kelly shipp in explaining why the 
setaside was not higher 
under the law the agriculture secretary each year must decide 
what if any acreage should be set aside in order to keep 
surpluses down yeutter could have asked for a greater acreage 
reduction or none at all 
the 5 percent figure is dramatically lower than past setasides 
during times of great surplus in recent years farmers have been 
asked to cut back the amount of land devoted the crop by as much as 
25 percent 
currently us wheat supplies are low because of the past 
success of the setaside program and because of two years of 
drought 
yeutter said price support loans and purchase rates would be 
195 a bushel a 20 percent reduction from the basic loan and 
purchase rate of 244 
this is the minimum allowed by law and 5 percent below the 1989 
loan and purchase rate of 206 a bushel 
he also set the established target price at 4 a bushel the 
statutory minimum and down about 2 percent from the 1989 target 
price 
furthermore he said would not implement paid land diversions 
marketing loans or related programs no secretary since 1985 has 
implemented these programs for wheat or corn partly because prices 
have been high and there has been no need for them

president bush should make full use of us 
leverage to discourage chinese leaders from cracking down on 
students demonstrating for democracy a former chief us 
disarmament negotiator said wednesday 
in the coming days hardline elements in the government and 
the armed forces may crack down on the students and workers in 
chinas democracy movement involving serious abuses of human and 
political rights former negotiator max kampelman said in a letter 
to bush 
kampelman now is chairman of freedom house an independent 
usbased policy organization that promotes human rights and civil 
liberties throughout the world 
the united states and china cooperate on military economic 
cultural scientific and educational programs which the peoples 
republic of china finds very much in its interest kampelman said 
this is the time for the united states to make it clear 
that such relationships as these may come under greater public 
scrutiny in our country and may not be sustainable if the 
established chinese leadership attempts to preserve its rule by 
abusing the basic political rights and civil liberties of the 
chinese people kampelmans letter said 
kampelman returned last month to freedom house after more than 
three years as chief negotiator for former president reagans 
administrator in the strategic arms reduction talks with the soviet 
union 
we at freedom house believe it is wrong now not to hold china 
to the common standards the united states uses in judging a 
countrys performance with regard to human rights kampelman said 
in the past the united states has understandably refrained 
from criticizing human rights abuses by allies and other friendly 
countries he said but too often that reluctance has proved 
illfounded and shortsighted

state regulators not the federal government 
must take the lead against false and misleading advertising and 
promotions involving cosmetic surgery and other medical procedures 
a federal official said wednesday 
that assertion by daniel oliver chairman of the federal trade 
commission was challenged by other officials who told a 
congressional panel that states sometimes are hampered by federal 
policies 
oliver said false and misleading advertising for cosmetic 
surgery is and should be a matter of concern to all agencies and 
organizations public and private at both the federal and state 
level 
but he added such procedures are generally practiced and 
promoted at a local level and therefore consumer protection must 
at least initially be the prime responsibility of the state 
medical boards and the state consumer protection authorities 
oliver also rejected any commission responsibility for physician 
competency in an appearance before the house subcommittee on 
regulation business opportunities and energy 
but the subcommittees chairman rep ron wyden dore said 
olivers view was an absurd rewriting of the ftc role in 
protection of consumers 
he said oliver was trying to make the states take the lead 
in areas the states say they are powerless to deal with 
richard g gannon executive director of the kansas board of 
healing arts told the subcommittee the issue of false and deceptive 
medical advertising is too complex and costly for the states to 
handle 
various ftc and court rulings have made it extremely difficult 
to discipline a doctor solely on the basis of advertising with the 
exception of the most blatant violations gannon said although 
he was unable to provide an example 
oliver contended the commissions antitrust law enforcement 
program presented no obstacles to effective state regulation and 
said rules that might suppress broad categories of truthful 
advertising were not the answer to the problem 
instead oliver said the agencys 1979 order lifting the ban on 
medical advertising and all subsequent orders expressly instructs 
or permits medical professionals to deal effectively with all 
forms of deceptive advertising 
but gannon said the only recent communication his state has had 
with the ftc was when the commission questioned whether the states 
censure of two doctors for deceptive and misleading advertising 
might place illegitimate restrainst on truthful advertising 
contacts by federal agencies whenever such actions are taken 
does cause consternations and may have a chilling effect if the 
result is to become embroiled in actions brought by the federal 
trade commission gannon said 
rep tom campbell rcalif suggested state regulators could 
remove federal jurisdiction from issues like medical advertising 
through action by state legislatures 
dr hugh johnston chairman of oregons board of medical 
examiners testified hed been instructed by the state attorney 
general to stay out of advertising because the state couldnt 
be sure of what constituted false advertising

the district of columbia has abandoned plans 
to impose a curfew on teenagers as part of an effort to reduce 
illegal narcotics sales and drugrelated violence in the nations 
capital city officials said wednesday 
last week us district court judge charles r richey struck 
down a proposed city curfew law ruling that the measure violated 
constitutionally protected freedom of association and free speech 
rights 
the judge earlier had struck down a more restrictive curfew 
measure 
charles pearson a spokesman for district councilmember frank 
smith said smith who had helped draft the two previous bills had 
expressed no intention of writing a third 
john c white a spokesman for mayor marion barry said neither 
barry nor other top city officials intended to pursue the matter 
the curfew aimed at keeping teens from congregating in the 
districts notorious openair drug markets would have prohibited 
anyone under 18 from gathering outside after 11 pm sunday through 
thursday and after midnight on friday and saturday the curfew 
would have been lifted each day at 6 am 
the citys second curfew bill included exemptions for teens 
traveling in cars or with their parents or when returning from 
work in addition those returning from school and churchrelated 
functions also were exempt 
however richey ruled that the measure would have subjected 
thousands of lawabiding city teenagers to virtual house 
arrest 
the local chapter of the american civil liberties union brought 
both suits against the city

the prospect that rep tom foley will 
replace jim wright as speaker of the house was greeted 
enthusiastically wednesday in the majority leaders home state and 
congressional district 
its no secret that we feel he would be the best choice for 
the job said karen marchioro state democratic central committee 
chairwoman personally hes very urbane and civil hes a rock 
really and right now that may be what we need 
foley has been a steadfast supporter of wright and during 
appearances in washington state last week repeatedly urged the 
speaker not to step down but in the wake of a house ethics 
investigation into his financial dealings wright said he would ask 
for a democratic caucus in the house to elect a new speaker on 
tuesday 
foley a 13term congressman is not expected to face a 
challenge to succeed wright by moving up from his no 2 position in 
the house democratic leadership 
foley 60 was a protege of washington states two most powerful 
politicians the late sens warren magnuson and henry m scoop 
jackson 
a selfdescribed parliamentarian and pragmatist foley is best 
known for his attempts to build bipartisan coalitions rather than 
clinging to party ideologies 
although i wish to proclaim ive always been totally satisfied 
with the innocence of speaker wright i think that foleys 
speakership will be a tremendous boon to the state of washington 
to the eastern district of the state and to the nation said 
carl maxey a prominent spokane lawyer and democrat 
tom foleys my good friend said maxey i would personally 
advise him to beware of being too compromising with these 
republicans because im satisfied the actions against the 
democrats are a political ploy much like the mccarthyism of the 
50s 
hes going to have to learn to fight 
in his 13 campaigns foley has rarely had to fight earning a 
reputation for gentlemanliness and always saying nice things about 
outgunned opponents in his largely rural 5th congressional district 
he certainly represents a district that would be one of the 
more conservative districts in the state but he represents our 
party well said mrs marchioro hes got to be next to scoop 
and maggie magnuson one of the most popular elected officials in 
this state

the burden of ending what house speaker jim 
wright called this season of bad will now rests with thomas s 
foley the washington democrat who will inherit wrights job next 
week and virtually no one thinks theres a better man for the 
challenge 
foley who presided over the house on wednesday as wright 
defended his honor and abdicated his office will lay full claim to 
the gavel when he is formally elected to congress most powerful 
job he will bring to the speakership a less partisan style that 
fits perfectly with president bushs call for accommodation between 
the executive and legislative branches 
as house majority leader foley 60 has won admiration from 
both sides of the aisle for his command of issues and tireless 
negotiating skills he is a master at finding consensus and 
striking compromise 
wright acknowledged in his farewell address that perhaps he 
had been too partisan too insistent too abrasive too 
determined to have my way foley is none of those things as any 
republican will tell you to the dismay of some democrats 
like wright foleys political roots trace to the new deal of 
franklin roosevelt but he is no kneejerk liberal and wouldnt 
have lasted in the house if he were unlike most leaders whose 
seats are safe he is from a distinctly republican and 
conservative district that has put him through many close 
elections though he won last year with 77 percent of the vote 
though handpicked for the houses elite by wright and his 
predecessor former speaker thomas p tip oneill foley never 
shared their penchant for bashing the reaganbush administration or 
other republican opponents oneill admired foley most for 
qualities he admittedly didnt possess himself meticulous 
craftsmanship of legislation thorough command of the issues 
attention to organizational detail 
tom foley oneill once said in both exasperation and 
respect is a man who can see three sides of every issue 
the reality is that in a modern participatory congress 
the responsibility of leadership and the necessity of leadership is 
to constantly involve members in the process of decision and 
consensus foley says 
according to rep pat williams dmont the troika of wright 
foley and soontoresign democratic whip tony coelho of california 
has worked like this jim the captain tony the oar drummer 
and tom the navigator democrats in the house and most republicans 
have great respect for the navigator 
foleys office furnishings reflect his eclectic approach 
instead of the big imposing desk preferred by most members of 
congress he has a coffee table surrounded by enough sofas and 
chairs to accommodate at least 18 visitors he does his paperwork 
at a small writing table in the corner 
and foley and his coffee table have been at the center of some 
of the most important legislation invariably compromises to 
emerge from congress in this decade 
just this year foley was host of the extraordinary talks that 
in midapril produced a budget agreement for the next fiscal year 
and he was pivotal in the bipartisan deal with the bush 
administration over central america policy 
a year earlier he chaired the economic summit sessions that 
followed the october 1987 crash of the stock market prior to that 
he engineered the final agreements on the grammrudman budget law 
and arms control policies shared by congress and the white house 
tom foley is just a very able capable individual says bob 
michel of illinois the house republican leader hes wellliked 
on our side and hes also recognized as a very formidable 
opponent one who will state the case well and is eminently fair 
hes a man of total integrity said senate republican leader 
bob dole rkan he knows the players knows the issues and 
this from rep henry hyde rill i wish he were a republican 
if he were he could be a presidential candidate

dwash is in line to become speaker of the house next week with 
the resignation of jim wright but a scramble is underway for other 
democratic leadership posts 
foley who has been in the no 2 post for the past 2 years was 
the only candidate for the top house position although he did no 
campaigning for the post prior to wrights announcement 
now there is a vacancy foley spokesman jeff biggs said late 
wednesday adding that he expected foley would begin calling his 
colleagues 
a caucus of the ruling democrats was scheduled for tuesday to 
nominate foley for the speakership 
jockeying was intense for the other top party positions which 
will turn over both because of wrights resignation and the 
announcement last week by the thirdranking house democrat 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif that he would step down 
it was not immediately clear on wednesday whether those 
positions would all be elected at tuesdays caucus but party 
leaders were said to be eager to get the party organized and moving 
forward in the wake of its unprecedented congressional crisis 
rep richard gephardt of missouri who ran unsuccessfully for 
the democratic presidential nomination last year was considered 
the favorite to replace foley as the majority leader his 
competitor for the post was rep ed jenkins a more conservative 
georgia democrat 
the race for coelhos post of majority whip the speakers chief 
votecounter was a wideopen contest among several prominent party 
members including 
william h gray iii of pennsylvania currently the chairman of 
the house democratic caucus gray is fighting bad publicity from 
reports that the justice department is conducting a preliminary 
inquiry into allegations that a noshow employee was carried on his 
office payroll

sen richard lugar will represent the united 
states at the inauguration thursday of alfredo cristiani as 
president of el salvador lugars office said wednesday 
lugar rind a former chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee headed the us delegation that observed the 1988 
provincial and municipal elections in the wartorn central american 
state 
president bush will be in london on thursday at the conclusion 
of his european trip 
cristiani a member of the rightwing arena party succeeds 
ailing president jose napoleon duarte a christian democrat known 
for his moderate views 
cristiani a useducated businessman has impressed members of 
congress during visits here both before and after his landslide 
election victory on march 19 
but some us lawmakers worry about what they regard as 
extremist elements within his political party 
some arena party members are accused of having links with 
deathsquad activities and are scornful of us emphasis on 
protection of human rights contending it impairs the war effort of 
the salvadoran army against leftist guerrillas 
but the bush administration appears to have convinced congress 
that el salvador should continue to receive substantial us 
military aid arguing successfully that cristiani should not be 
penalized before he even takes office 
administration officials and congressional sources have said 
us military aid to el salvador in fiscal 1990 is expected to 
remain at 85 million about 12 million less than the state 
department had requested 
lugar planned private meetings with both cristiani and duarte 
and will play host on thursday to all foreign officials and 
dignitaries attending the inauguration 
these are exciting times in which change toward greater 
freedom is sweeping the world lugar said in a statement 
but we must all remember that with burgeoning freedom comes 
sobering responsibilities for leaders everywhere responsibilities 
to protect human rights such as free speech and peaceful life

procter amp gamble lost at least 300 
million because kimberlyclark copied the design of its 
superabsorbent diapers an attorney said wednesday in final 
arguments in a federal lawsuit over pampers and huggies 
procter amp gamble forecast it would make that much money annually 
from its superabsorbent pampers said attorney allen gerstein who 
was representing the soap toiletries and disposable diaper giant 
but sales were 150 million below projections in each of fiscal 
years 198687 and 198788 after kimberlyclark violated the pampers 
patent and introduced superabsorbent huggies gerstein told us 
district judge falcon hawkins 
cincinnatibased procter amp gamble wants hawkins to order 
kimberlyclark to stop manufacturing superabsorbent huggies and to 
remove them from store shelves the company also is seeking 
unspecified money damages 
about 33 billion worth of disposable diapers are sold each 
year according to industry officials procter amp gamble is the 
industry leader with about 47 percent of the market while 
kimberlyclark is no 2 with about 30 percent 
hawkins is expected to rule in the nonjury case sometime this 
summer if he decides kimberlyclark is liable damages will be 
determined in a separate proceeding 
twentythree witnesses testified and about 4100 exhibits were 
introduced during 17 days of testimony in the trial that began last 
month 
procter amp gamble contends that researchers paul weisman and 
steve goldman developed a way to combine wood pulp fluff and super 
absorbent materials in diapers to allow them to be made thinner 
the company has argued that kimberlyclark violated its patent 
on the process when it later introduced its superabsorbent huggies 
but kimberlyclark says procter amp gamble never had a valid 
patent because it provided misleading information to the us 
patent office 
patent attorney v bryan medlock jr representing 
kimberlyclark testified that if the patent offices examining 
officer had known about earlier work on a similar process by an 
italian inventor the patent would never have been issued to 
procter amp gamble 
in his closing arguments medlock said kimberlyclark 
totally independently developed its huggies supertrim diapers 
the super absorbent material in procter amp gambles testmarketed 
diapers did not work well medlock said and they leaked 
procter amp gamble addressed the problem in later versions of its 
diaper products that included concentrating areas of super 
absorbers and manufacturing doublelayered diapers 
the trial is being held here because kimberlyclark has a a 
diaper manufacturing plant at beech island near the georgia border

a justice department investigation into the 
personnel practices of walter fauntroy the district of columbias 
nonvoting delegate to congress has been extended to examine all 
of his hiring records for the last five years the associated press 
has learned 
as part of the wideranging inquiry a grand jury intends to 
begin hearing testimony from current and former employees of 
fauntroy a democrat and rep gus savage dill over fauntroys 
hiring of savages son according to sources familiar with the 
investigation 
thomas john savage the son of rep savage was paid 21398 
while on fauntroys payroll between september 1987 and june 1988 
but swore on illinois election documents that he was living in 
chicago during that time those records were filed as part of his 
unsuccessful bid to win an illinois house seat 
individuals from the fauntroy and savage offices will be 
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury within the next month and 
investigators have already subpoenaed payroll documents and office 
personnel data from the two congressmen said sources who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity 
those records have been requested to determine whether the 
younger savage his father or fauntroy falsified payroll documents 
or offered false statements to investigators 
fauntroy and rep savage declined to comment when asked whether 
documents from their offices had been requested by federal 
authorities 
when contacted by telephone in chicago thomas john savage 
declined to comment wednesday 
in addition investigators are examining the personal banking 
records of thomas savage to learn whether he returned any money to 
his father or fauntroy the sources said 
investigators are also closely examining accounts of the younger 
savages job duties submitted voluntarily to federal officials by 
johnny barnes fauntroys chief aide and several other fauntroy 
staffers sources said 
barnes refused to comment on the documents when contacted 
wednesday by a reporter 
while the statements from fauntroys staffers describe thomas 
savage as regularly showing up for work the ap has reported that 
investigators have been told that the younger savage showed up in 
rep savages chicago office on an almostdaily basis during the 
period he was supposedly in washington 
on several occasions the ap reported office workers there 
allegedly were told by staffers in rep savages washington office 
to keep the younger savage away from windows to prevent anyone 
passing the storefront office from seeing him 
the fbi opened the case with a 90day preliminary investigation 
in december shortly after the ap reported on fauntroys hiring of 
the younger savage 
officials at the justice departments criminal division then 
recommended that atorney general dick thornburgh appoint a special 
prosecutor to look into the case under the terms an order by his 
predecessor edwin meese iii that rule instituted by meese just 
days before he left office last august required an independent 
prosecutor to examine cases of alleged wrongdoing by members of 
congress 
however thornburgh scuttled the meese order and turned the 
probe back to the justice departments criminal division which 
traditionally handles such cases

house members reacting to jim wrights 
emotional resignation speech said wednesday they supported the 
speakers decision to step down because charges of ethics 
violations had ended his chance to be an effective leader 
the price paid was so disproportional but he did the only 
thing he could do said wright defender charles wilson dtexas 
citing an emotional burden that made it impossible to go on 
wright correctly recognized the utility of his speakership was 
over said rep david obey dwis who was chairman of a panel 
that wrote many of the ethics rules 
president bush praised wright a fellow texan saying in a 
statement in spite of the present situation i believe the 
wright tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication to the 
congress of the united states 
rep martin frost dtexas said he hoped members listened 
carefully to wrights urging that democrats refrain from thoughts 
of avenging the resignation and that republicans not try to 
retaliate for the defeat earlier this year of the nomination of 
john tower for secretary of defense 
he did an awful lot of good as speaker frost added 
immediately after wright made his announcement rep jack 
brooks dtexas stood at the same podium on the house floor and 
expressed his fears about the evil wind blowing in the halls of 
congress 
rep louis stokes dohio former chairman of the ethics 
committee warned that if the present mood remains the end result 
will be to destroy this institution as we know it today 
house minority leader bob michel rill said wrights 
resignation was a sad time for the house and for wright but added 
it is also an unprecedented opportunity for the house to begin a 
bipartisan comprehensive reformation of this institution and its 
rules 
and rep bill richardson dnm said the house is like a war 
zone right now where you dont know when the next bomb is going to 
drop he said a time for healing is needed but warned that if 
house republican whip newt gingrich rga who filed the original 
charges against wright wants to engage in open warfare there 
will be a democratic response 
gingrich who waged a vigorous public battle against wright 
avoided reporters as he left the house chamber after wrights 
speech 
but richard viguerie chairman of the united conservatives of 
america said liberal democrats can obviously dish it out to 
good and decent conservatives but they cant stand the heat in 
the kitchen the ethics war they started has turned against them 
conservatives dont want scalps they want fairness 
rep robert torricelli dnj who was involved in wrights 
defense said wrights parting gift was a warning to stop the 
vengeance 
torricelli said wright had no choice but to resign rather than 
fight the charges he knew what the toll of that battle might 
be the new jersey congressman said 
rep richard gephardt dmo expected to be elected majority 
leader after the elevation of majority leader thomas foley to 
speaker praised wrights record 
under jims leadership the house passed legislation on trade 
reform plant closing the drug problem welfare reform housing 
aid for the homeless clean water and other important measures 
gephardt said jim has a record of public service that he can be 
proud of 
rep guy vander jagt of michigan head of the republican 
congressional campaign committee said his party planned to use the 
resignation as a campaign issue unless democrats passed an election 
reform package acceptable to the gop 
i feel truly sorry for wright as a human being he added but 
called the wright case an example of corruption that occurs when 
one party is in control of an institution for too long 
i believe that in his heart he doesnt believe he did anything 
wrong vander jagt said 
rep don edwards dcalif called wrights speech a very 
poignant emotional moment in american history it was almost like 
hamlet a prince on his knees 
he missed his calling he should have been a trial lawyer 
rep mike oxley rohio if he had been giving a summation to a 
jury he would have walked

police swinging clubs and firing 
tear gas quickly dispersed a demonstration wednesday night by about 
1000 ethnic albanian students in the capital of restive kosovo 
province 
the police carrying machine guns and wearing riot gear charged 
protesters who had shouted freedom freedom and demonstrated 
for two hours against what they said was harassment of ethnic 
albanians by yugoslav authorities 
the demonstration was held in front of the downtown university 
dormitory and the rally and dispersal were witnessed by an 
associated press reporter 
officers moved in at about 1030 pm after a brief warning to 
the demonstrators to disperse police launched tear gas canisters 
and charged the protesters with truncheons 
demonstrators ran in panic inside dormitory buildings windows 
and glass doors were shattered in the shuffle 
several protesters were seen being taken away in police vans 
after the action 
however no one appeared to have been seriously injured and the 
police action took about five minutes 
this was the second day of protest against constitutional 
changes passed in march that gave greater control over this 
albaniandominated region to serbia of which kosovo has been an 
autonomous province 
on tuesday about 2000 demonstrators demanding to see a 
visiting european parliaments delegation probing alleged human 
rights violations in kosovo dispersed peacefully 
in belgrade yugoslav premier ante markovic on wednesday told 
the delegation it would be allowed to meet prominent ethnic 
albanian dissidents 
we were not able to fulfill our task in kosovo because we were 
not given the opportunity to meet with people from the other 
side danish member frode kristoffersen said after the delegation 
cut short its visit to kosovo 
the fivemember delegation arrived in pristina on tuesday during 
a new outbreak of unrest in which one ethnic albanian died in 
nearby podujevo 
martine charriotschneider secretary of the mission said the 
group had planned to stay in kosovo for three full days but we 
are leaving after 13 hours 
we are quite disappointed because the talks with ethnic 
albanian intellectuals and other members of the opposition were 
absolutely necessary lilo seibelemmeling a west german member 
said 
about 85 percent of kosovos 18 million people are ethnic 
albanians the serbian minority complains of discrimination in the 
southern province which borders on albania and is an ancient 
serbian heartland 
giorgio rosetti an italian member said the delegation had been 
kept from meeting six kosovo legislators who voted against the 
constitutional amendments and who he said were indicted and now are 
awaiting trial 
he complained that markovic would not arrange a visit to jails 
housing ethnic albanians accused of organizing demonstrations and 
riots in february and march 
the unrest killed at least 24 people and a state of emergency 
was declared in the province 
at least 60000 ethnic albanians took part in protests after 
serbia yugoslavias largest republic adopted the constitutional 
amendments providing greater control 
about 800 ethnic albanians were arrested and 237 including 
former provincial communist party chief azem vllasi and other 
prominent politicians businessmen and intellectuals were detained 
without charge under federal emergency laws 
at least 47 are still being held in isolation around kosovo 
members of the european parliaments delegation headed by 
julian grimaldos of spain said they also wanted to talk to vllasi 
who is awaiting trial 
even though we were officially invited by the yugoslav 
government we have a feeling they wanted to shorten our visit 
ms charriotschneider said the conditions of the visit made us 
fail in doing our job

colleagues gave him a standing ovation and wright removed his 
glasses and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief 
president bush issued a statement saying in spite of the 
present situation i believe the wright tenure was one of 
effectiveness and dedication he wished wright and his wife well 
wrights move cleared the way for the elevation to the 
speakership of majority leader thomas foley dwash and for a 
string of other changes that would complete a shift to a new 
postworld war ii generation of leaders in congress 
the resignation which will become effective after the new 
speaker is elected by the house on tuesday came after a yearlong 
15 million investigation by the house ethics committee that led 
to formal charges that wright violated house rules in 69 instances 
many of the specific charges involved two main allegations 
that he used bulk sales of his book reflections of a public 
man to hide contributions from groups to which he had spoken 
that he received 145000 in benefits including a nowork job 
for his wife from george mallick a fort worth businessman with an 
alleged direct interest in legislation before congress 
the charges which preoccupied capitol hill in recent weeks 
caused widespread concern among the democrats who elected wright 
speaker three years ago that his effectiveness as the partys 
highest elected leader had been permanently damaged some also 
indicated usually in private that they were worried the issue 
would hurt them in next years elections 
the ethics committee postponed a meeting that had been scheduled 
for thursday to take action on wrights motion to dismiss the most 
serious charges one democratic source sympathetic to wright said 
he believed the ethics panel now would drop the case entirely 
in his floor speech wright argued forcefully and in detail 
against the charges contending mrs wright had researched 
investments for the small company owned by the wrights and the 
mallicks and earned her salary and the use of a car and condominium 
mallick provided and he repeated his contention that mallick had 
no direct interest in legislation 
wright also contended his book was not a scheme to evade outside 
earnings limits as the ethics panel alleged but a legitimate 
publishing venture 
he challenged the ethics enforcement process which he said had 
been agonizing for him and suggested it should be reformed 
perhaps we might want to consider outright aboliton of all 
honoraria and speaking fees altogether in exchange for an 
increase in federal pay 
wright repeatedly wiped his brow during his speech at times his 
hands were shaking he worked alone in his office on the statement 
then walked to the house floor to deliver it 
his resignation had been expected since last week when his 
lawyers and members of the house ethics committee discussed the 
possibility of an arrangement under which some of panels major 
charges against him would be dismissed in return for his giving up 
the speakership 
wright himself has consistently denied knowingly violating 
ethics rules but his political support among democrats in the 
house eroded steadily as the ethics committee methodically 
investigated his finances 
rep david obey dwis said the resignation would not hurt the 
house 
what it really represents is the moving of a new generation of 
political power into this place obey said alluding to the 
earlier selection of sen george mitchell dmaine as the senate 
majority leader with the ascent of foley into the leadership you 
have a total changing of the guard 
foley in a statement called wright a symbol of constancy 
courage and commitment to principle who would go down in history 
as a great speaker 
some wright supporters were bitter 
there is an evil wind blowing in the halls of congress that is 
reminiscent of the spanish inquisition said rep jack brooks 
dtexas 
added sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who listened to wrights 
defense in the house chamber after 35 years of effective and 
able service to his state and to the nation jim deserves better 
than this 
the whole last year has been a living nightmare for him 
said rep robert torricelli dnj 
the house republican leader bob michel of illinois said while 
the resignation was a sad moment for the house and personal tragedy 
for wright it is also an unprecedented opportunity for the house 
to begin a bipartisan comprehensive reformation of the institution 
and its rules 
one democratic source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
wright had concluded last week that he would have to resign after 
he received word that the ethics committee was poised to reject his 
motion to dismiss the most serious charges 
few took the wright matter seriously in december 1987 when rep 
newt gingrich rga announced plans to file a complaint against 
the speaker with the ethics committee common cause the government 
watchdog group called for an investigation five months later 
the ethics panel opened deliberations june 2 
the 100th congress adjourned on oct 22 with one of the most 
productive records of recent years under wrights leadership and 
the ethics committee continued to take testimony into the fall and 
winter wright was reelected as speaker on jan 3 
on april 3 wright conceded that he might have 
unintentionally and technically violated some rules but 
defended his intentions as good 
as the house reeled from nearly daily allegations of new 
scandals ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said 
wednesday that innuendoes of wrongdoing were getting out of 
hand 
the latest to hit the capitol was word from government sources 
that the fbi was investigating allegations that rep bill gray 
dpa had a noshow employee on his payroll gray denied 
wrongdoing 
gray is a candidate for majority whip the no 3 democratic 
leadership post left vacant by the weekend resignation announcement 
of rep tony coelho dcalif the pennsylvanian questioned the 
timing of the word about the investigation 
coelho faced his own ethics problems over a junk bond 
investment and said he was choosing to get out rather than subject 
the party to another protracted ethics probe

in the city jim wright represented for 
34 years the house speakers resignation wednesday prompted fear 
sorrow anger at republicans and little surprise 
anybody who knows anything of the american political process 
knows the loss of the speakership is a major loss for this area 
said mayor bob bolen whose city has long counted wright as a major 
asset in attacting defense jobs 
officials said it may be impossible to rebuild the political 
power or match the economic gain the region enjoyed from wrights 
34year tenure and his leadership in the democratic party 
we just lost our right arm in fort worth state rep doyle 
willis who represents the city in the texas house said in austin 
i think he got a dirty republican deal i think they were after 
him and they finally got him 
wright resigned under a cloud of ethics charges 
i disagree with mr wrights implication that he was treated 
unfairly said texas republican party chairman fred meyer of 
dallas meyer said the house ethics committee which investigated 
and charged wright with violations of house rules acted in a fair 
and bipartisan manner 
gov bill clements the states only republican governor this 
century praised wrights efforts for texas 
this is not a good day for texas clements said jim 
wright has done a fine job representing the state in washington 
dc and his years of service and leadership in congress will be 
sorely missed 
as pressure against wright grew this week texas politicians 
began talking about potential replacements state sen hugh parmer 
a fort worth democrat was frequently mentioned to serve the 
remainder of wrights 18th term in the house 
clements can call a special election no sooner than 30 days and 
no later than 90 days after the date of resignation wright said he 
would step down as speaker as soon as his colleagues choose a 
replacement and that he would resign his house seat by the end of 
june 
the executive director of the texas democratic party ed martin 
predicted trouble for the gop if a republican tries to win wrights 
seat 
i dont think thered be a real reservoir of good feeling 
towards republicans martin said if i were a republican i 
think id wear a flak jacket in fort worth 
parmer who describes wright as his oldest and closest 
political friend said wrights decision was a loss for all of 
us 
nothing that has occurred can take away from the immense good 
this man has done for his district texas and for america hungry 
children eat because of jim wright homeless people have hope 
because of jim wright american boys are not dying in central 
america because of jim wright said parmer 
in wrights 12th congressional district people gathered around 
televisions in an electronics shop to watch his resignation speech 
to the house 
i think its horrible said lynn bratcher hes the only 
one i could call on for help when i needed help hes the only 
one that has ever really done anything for anyone for texas 
i think its a shame and disgrace that the news media has 
challenged his integrity 
at a federal office workers turned on the radio and cheered as 
wright defended himself in his hourlong speech one woman yelled 
touche as wright dismissed the ethics committees charges 
minutes later they fell silent as wright said i give you back 
this job 
the employees went back to work they declined to give their 
names 
in weatherford the ranching town about 30 miles west of forth 
worth where wright grew up and served as mayor in 195054 mayor 
sherry watson called his resignation plans truly awful 
jim has done us a wonderful job up there and i was truly 
hoping that he would continue on said ms watson 
being the third most powerful man in washington he was able 
to do a lot for all of us this is an attack on texas i am anxious 
for people in texas to pick up from this and go on she said

wrights offers for the record affidavits from five individuals 
who attest that mrs wright earned her 18000 salary 
the outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested 
that mrs wrights employment somehow amounted to a gift 
does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes so many 
pages of typed manuscript she wasnt a carpenter is a womans 
mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a 
work product 
for most of her adult life mrs wright has been a business 
person been an officer in a large hotel an officer in a 
successful real estate and construction firm a professional staff 
person on a congressional committee 
she was making more than 18000 when she worked at the 
congressional committee 
and heres the irony the supreme irony 
in 1976 when i was elected majority leader betty voluntarily 
left her job as a professional staff person on the committee so as 
to avoid any criticism 
now it just seems to me there isnt any justification at all for 
anybodys even raising questions about whether she earned her 
18000 a year betty also had the use of a company car that 
is true she did 
i want to do the right thing the honorable thing 
i bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds 
what more can i do does that make it right 
now concerning the apartment we didnt think there was 
anything wrong with paying a per diem rate we paid on a daily 
basis for our use of that apartment 
nevertheless last year i said to george mallick i said i want 
to buy the apartment i paid the amount suggested and appraised 
by two real estate persons in fort worth 58000 i just 
wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say if weve made a 
mistake weve done what we can to set things right i dont think 
weve violated any rules 
the second alleged violation continues on the assumption 
that george mallick our friend and business partner had a direct 
interest in influencing legislation which would make it illegal 
for us to accept gifts from him 
ive known this man for more than 25 years hes been my 
friend never once in all the years that ive known this man has 
he ever asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation 
 
not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any 
administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any 
institution in which he has an interest 
now the only other basic question its just one that remains 
in the statement of alleged violations concerns the sale of a 
book a little book now youll recall reflections of a public 
man which i wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities 
people who took it and gave it away to other people students 
newspapers public officials and members of their organizations 
and i wanted them to i wanted to get the widest possible 
distribution of the book 
now the contention is that this book project on which i 
got 325 for every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a 
subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed and 
violate the outside earnings limitation of a member of congress 
if monetary gain had been my primary interest dont you think i 
would have gone to one of the big madison avenue publications the 
houses there that give you a big advance 
it is true i think that people on my staff were eager to sell 
these books they knew i wanted them sold ive got to accept some 
responsibility for that if it was wrong but the rule doesnt say 
it was wrong the rules expressly exempt royalty income i 
didnt intend to try to violate the outside earning limitations and 
i dont believe legally that i did

sacramento calif was brought to mae sot hospital tuesday night 
medical staff said 
police said motley apparently crossed into burma three days 
earlier with ethnic karen rebels and went to their camp at kaw moo 
ra which has been besieged by burmese troops since may 18 
fighting has been intense in the jungles of this border region 
since burmese troops launched an offensive last october against the 
rebels who are fighting for autonomy from the central government 
us embassy spokesman neil klopfenstein confirmed the death 
wednesday of an american citizen after an incident on the 
thaiburma border but refused to give details

about 300 soldiers marched in formation near 
studentoccupied tiananmen square thursday as conservative leaders 
turned up the heat in their campaign against the prodemocracy 
movement 
the governments show of force was the first of its kind near 
tiananmen since a sitin for a freer society with less corruption 
began may 13 
the troopers from the peoples liberation army marched in front 
of the beijing hotel near tiananmen about 630 am and turned down 
a side street 
it was not clear how many of the thousands of students camped in 
the square saw the procession 
i think they were just sent to try and scare us said wang 
di a sophomore at beijing journalism institute who saw the troops 
pass by but i didnt think anyone was scared they didnt come 
that close and not many students knew they were there 
the government wednesday held its first rally in response to six 
weeks of prodemocracy protests but a torched effigy of chinas 
most famous dissident and slogans supporting premier li pengs 
hardline policies failed to rouse the 4000 people who attended 
the rally 20 miles outside beijing 
many participants said officials told them to attend 
thousands of noisy marchers meanwhile trooped from tiananmen 
to police and communist party headquarters wednesday night to 
demand the resignation of li and senior leader deng xiaoping who 
have led the crackdown on the popular uprising for democracy 
conservatives are trying to discredit the student movement and 
consolidate their position in a political power struggle with 
moderates 
the marchers primarily students beat drums pots and pans and 
chanted down with kidnapping to protest the arrest this week 
of three leaders of an independent labor union 
zhao pinglu head of the trade union that was formed in sympathy 
with the prodemocracy movement said the men were released 
wednesday after police questioned them for a day 
the government rally at a stadium in daxing county was staged by 
supporters of conservative leaders who reportedly have stripped 
moderate communist party chief zhao ziyang of his post 
we will oppose whoever opposes li peng read one banner 
others supported martial law for central beijing decreed by li on 
may 20 after more than 1 million people took to the streets to 
demand more democracy and an end to corruption among officials 
the government rally attended by peasants workers and high 
school students lacked the enthusiasm of the prodemocracy 
demonstrations that have been mounted in major cities 
the burning of effigies of astrophysicist fang lizhi an 
outspoken dissident who has campaigned for democracy and an 
unidentified schemer an apparent reference to zhao failed to 
stir the listless crowd 
few people joined rally leaders in shouting long live the 
communist party and other slogans some giggled and others waved 
tiny flags instead 
i think this is a sham said a 26yearold worker shortly 
after the rally ended as a citizen i feel very indignant 
thats right said onlookers 
to tell you the truth we were forced to come said an 
18yearold high school student 
zhou hong a county official who organized the rally said the 
demonstration was to oppose turmoil created by a small group 
of people for political goals 
beijing officials informed some foreign journalists tuesday of 
the daxing march and two others in suburban beijing nationwide tv 
broadcast a brief segment of one of the marches during the evening 
news 
large banners bearing slogans opposing bourgeois 
liberalization and capitalism over socialism appeared on beijing 
hotels on wednesday 
fang and a handful of other intellectuals were purged from the 
party in the antibourgeois liberalization campaign of 1987 which 
began after the last round of studentled protests for democracy 
but diplomatic and chinese sources say a meeting of the party 
central committee to ratify the purge of zhao has been postponed 
because the leadership remains divided 
sources say at least 200000 military troops called to beijing 
to enforce martial law also are pawns in the power struggle going 
on at the top levels 
tens of thousands of citizens mobilized to block troops from 
entering beijing after li declared martial law 
the march through central beijing wednesday night was much 
smaller than other prodemocracy demonstrations of the past few 
weeks highlighting the difficulties faced by the students to keep 
their movement alive despite continued government pressure 
the government maintained a media blitz condemning the 
occupation of tiananmen square in central beijing where about 
10000 students live in squatter camps to press their demands

lameduck military president augusto 
pinochet on wednesday said his government and the opposition have 
agreed on democratic reforms in chiles constitution including 
replacing a ban on marxism 
in a speech broadcast on national radio and television the 
73yearold president and army commander called the accord an 
expression of the national will to find the best ways to achieve 
the full democracy we all want 
hours before pinochets speech patricio aylwin spokesman for a 
17party opposition coalition said the parties gave a green 
light to the changes drafted by the government for the 8yearold 
constitution written by the military 
the agreement came after two months of unprecedented 
negotiations between the 15yearold rightwing military government 
and its foes the negotiations put aylwin facetoface with 
interior minister carlos caceres and leaders of two progovernment 
conservative parties also took part 
pinochet came to power in a military coup in 1973 that toppled 
the elected government of president salvador allende a marxist 
pinochet is scheduled to hand over power on march 11 1990 to 
the winner of an election set for dec 14 he had to call the 
election after his bid to extend his term until 1997 was 
overwhelmingly rejected by voters in a referendum in october 
aylwin is considered the most likely opposition candidate in the 
election 
full details of the proposed changes were not immediately 
disclosed but pinochet said they include replacing a controversial 
article banning marxism with another that ensures in a better way 
a responsible political pluralism 
the government also agreed to the oppositions demand to change 
the makeup of the future senate he said it had offered to 
increase the number of elected senators from 36 to 38 diluting the 
influence of nine appointed senators 
aylwin said the government did not accept all the reforms sought 
by the opposition but there was some clear progress 
the government submit the proposed changes to the fourman 
military junta junta approval is considered certain as is 
approval in a subsequent national referendum expected in august 
another article strongly opposed by the opposition establishes a 
militarydominated national security council empowered to 
represent its views on key matters to future civilian 
governments 
pinochet said that clause would also be amended but did not 
elaborate the government indicated earlier it is prepared to add 
another civilian member 
aylwin said the opposition will continue to push for changes 
that lead to an authentically democratic regime 
ricardo lagos a socialist opposition leader said this is a 
first step and a step that is positive for the country

transplant doctors predict pigs will become a 
main source of donor organs for people once the many technical 
problems of crossspecies transplantation are resolved 
while primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better 
match pigs are cheaper more plentiful and easier to breed says 
dr hugh auchincloss jr assistant professor of surgery at harvard 
university 
what could change i suppose is that we could become better 
at making artificial organs than we are now then we wouldnt need 
the animal organs but i dont see that as coming first 
auchincloss said tuesday at the annual meeting of the american 
society of transplant physicians 
only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for

high schools are requiring students to read 
almost exactly what they did 25 years ago heavy on shakespeare but 
light on works by female and minority authors according to a 
survey 
eightyfour percent of public high schools assign students 
romeo and juliet the tearful shakespearean play that tops the 
list of required works according to the nationwide survey by the 
center for the learning amp teaching of literature at state 
university of new york at albany 
but only one of the top 10 most frequently assigned works was by 
a female author to kill a mockingbird by harper lee no 
works were by minorities according to the survey of 322 public 
schools 80 catholic schools and 86 private schools conducted last 
spring 
i think the survey shows schools are still very much concerned 
with emphasizing good literature they continue to assign classics 
complemented with modern and accessible works said the surveys

dallas county to abandon an atlarge system of electing the county 
commission a system civil rights advocates say ensured the 
election of whites blacks comprise 55 percent of the countys 
50000 residents but less than 45 percent of registered voters 
the county fought the lawsuit proposing its own district 
election plan that would have called for four districts two 
predominately black two mostly white and a commission chairman 
elected by all county voters 
it was fair said probate judge johnny jones who by virtue 
of his office served as president of the commission under the 
atlarge system the plan the commission devised was extremely 
fair 
meanwhile black leaders including pope devised an opposing 
plan calling for three black districts and two white districts with 
the commissioners choosing their chairman the plan finally was 
approved in the federal courts last year leading to elections that 
sent pope erskine minor and perry varner to the county courthouse 
pope admits his sprawling district is quite challenging but 
defends the arrangement as fair to everyone i feel it is as just 
a plan as we could come up with blacks are in greater numbers as 
far as population is concerned and we had to address the districts 
accordingly 
the three were sworn in jan 16 the first blacks to serve on 
the panel since the republican party controlled the south after the 
civil war 
the new commissioners promised to end what they saw as 
longstanding favoritism toward whites but not everyone agrees 
that their early actions have been colorblind one of their first 
acts was to remove the longtime license commissioner who was 
white and replace her with a black woman 
in addition former commissioner bill kendrick accused pope of 
ordering the paving of driveways owned by blacks while ignoring 
those of whites a critical issue in a mostly rural county where 
rain turns many roads into quagmires 
i would like to see every road in dallas county updated and 
paved wherever possible pope said but do them all alike 
dont pick out certain roads whites got preference in the past 
the maps indicate that 
the dispute led pope to claim that kendrick had threatened his 
life and kendrick who denied it to claim that he in turn had 
received threats 
the new commissioners also found the same basic problems that 
plagued previous commissions and other counties in the depressed 
black belt an area named for its rich black soil but filled with 
poor modestly educated or illiterate people most of them black 
basically were just trying to fulfill our major obligations 
and barely meet our payroll said minor a county employee for 
more than 12 years until his election to the commission 
kendrick who was replaced by pope understands the new 
commissions dilemma we never had any extra money the only 
thing the county commission can do is spend money frugally 
twentyfour years ago selma became forever linked with the 
struggle for racial equality when voting rights marchers were 
beaten on the edmund pettus bridge by clubwielding police at the 
start of a march to montgomery 
two weeks later the marchers were back under federal 
protection and with the rev martin luther king jr to cross the 
bridge and complete their march into history a few months later 
congress approved the voting rights act 
since those turbulent times both blacks and whites agree that 
selma and dallas county have made racial gains at least 
politically but minor says true equality wont be a reality until 
blacks share in the countys limited wealth 
i have not seen much economic gain for the black community my 
son is graduating from high school this year and he plans to go to 
college next year when he graduates in four years there will be 
nothing for him to come back to in this area i dont see any 
opportunity for jobs 
dallas countys unemployment rate stands at 113 percent more 
than twice the nations average and significantly higher than the 
states 73 percent 
the birth of the movement began here minor said but 
other counties are enjoying the fruits of our labor 
adds pope i dont know of anyone in dallas county or this 
country who is looking for more than his percentage of the pie we 
cant continue to see whites get all the better jobs

chieftains of roman catholic education are 
pressing president bush to clear up publicly whether he wants 
parents allowed to put some of their taxes into schooling they 
choose for their children 
that essentially would be the effect of tuition tax credits 
for parents of pupils in church and other nonpublic schools 
its a longtime explosive political issue on which the 
education president as bush says he aspires to be has become 
subtly enmeshed and on which catholic educators want straight 
answers 
we assume a meeting with him is going to come through says 
sister catherine mcnamee president of the national catholic 
educational association were still waiting 
she and other catholic educational leaders plus ll archbishops 
who cosigned a letter from cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago 
have asked bush for a meeting june 9 to clarify his position 
he indicated support for tuition tax credits in his campaign 
but a comment last march 29 gave the impression hes no longer 
interested in it sister mcnamee said in a telephone interview 
were still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt 
she said but want him to set the record straight in a public way 
bernardin in his letter signed by other prelates suggested 
bush had a debt to catholics since because of his campaign 
commitments catholics played a significant role in your 
successful election bid 
the question of parental choice in education is a vital and 
crucial issue in our nation today he told bush and church 
educators want him to clarify misconceptions and to address 
questions or misgivings you might have 
in his march comments bush said he was intrigued with the 
concept of tuition tax credits but that it is the obligation of 
all taxpayers to support a public education system 
he said parents of nonpublic school students have a right to 
shell out in addition to the tax money tuition money but that 
they should not get a break for that 
bushs press secretary subsequently qualified the comments 
saying bush has not shifted his commitments but current budget 
contstraints prevent considering tuition tax credits 
despite the elaborations bushs comments have cast a shadow 
of confusion on our previous perceptions says sister anne 
leonard vice president of educational administrators of the nea 
in her letter to bush jointly signed by other catholic 
education officials and school superintendents in major cities she 
said the meeting is needed to dispel confusion 
we are not asking you or the federal government to subsidize 
our religion she said we do not want that 
we do believe firmly that parents have a constitutional right 
to choose the educational milieu for their children without 
penalty and to benefit directly from their educational tax 
dollars 
catholicisms vast educational enterprise serving 76 million 
students at all levels includes 9000 elementary and secondary 
schools 
most of them especially in urban areas enroll both catholics 
and children of varied religions many are too poor to pay but 
tuitions of those who can and supplementary contributions pay the 
multibillion dollar costs 
parents should be able to choose the kind of education and 
schools they want for their children sister mcnamee said in a 
telephone interview but many now cant because it means paying 
double school taxes and tuition 
many families now do not have a real choice in schools for 
their children because they cant afford that double burden 
the suggested june 9 meeting with bush proposed two weeks ago 
with no direct reply yet was suggested because administrators of 
the big l0 catholic schools systems are meeting in washington 
at that time 
sister leonard also director of educational services in chicago 
besides her post with catholic education administrators said in 
the joint letter to bush 
as catholic educators we have struggled to maintain a viable 
presence in the heart of our urban centers to give the poorest in 
our land a real option a genuine choice for their children of an 
education that is godcentered and which has a moral component to 
it 
parents want this choice but are often unable to exercise it 
for financial reasons 
noting that the 2700 schools in ll major urban dioceses enroll 
a million children at a cost of 14 billion annually she says 
this saves the country 2 billion annually since perpupil costs in 
public schools range from 4l00 to 6900 per year 
citing remarks by bush that the govenment cannot afford to help 
parents of children in nonpublic schools she said 
we strongly disagree we believe faced with the present 
national crisis in education that you cannot afford not to help

the recently merged evangelical lutheran church 
in america ended its first fiscal year with a deficit of 158 
million spending 1043 million but with income of only 885 
million 
bishop herbert w chilstrom head of the 5 millionmember 
denomination says the situation requires some painful 
adjustments in the coming months but the longrange picture 
for the church is good 
he says members apparently have increased giving at the local 
level but cut back in giving to the churchwide organization on the 
assumption it was doing all right 
among steps being taken to deal with the problem are a freeze on 
staff enlargements limiting salary boosts to a maximum of 25 
percent and reducing the number of persons traveling to regional 
events 
the deficit is being covered by reserves and proceeds from sale 
of property mainly former headquarters of the three merging

faith still brings martyrdom for many 
christians says a noted missions researcher 
the rev david barrett editor of the world christian 
encyclopedia estimates 325000 christians have been killed for the 
faith each year over the last quarter century 
theres nothing unusual about this he says its gone on 
for 20 centuries its simply a part of the life of the church 
he says his estimates are based not only on news accounts but 
on data that often emerge years after the incidents also he 
counts as martyrs believers who lose their lives because of human 
hostility often political 
barrett a british anglican now serving the southern baptist 
foreign missions board estimates 40 million christians have been 
martyred since the time of christ 
but the church knows the names of only 15000 martyrs he says 
as for the rest nobody wrote their story down their names are 
lost

hildegard haskell took the right precautions 
mrs haskell 77 who used a metal walker enlisted the aid of 
her friend hazel selden 80 in crossing busy beachwood drive on 
oct 27 at 755 pm it was dark and difficult for the drivers 
of cars speeding through the hollywood hills to see people on the 
street 
no doubt the women waited a while before stepping off the curb 
when they did they were hit police say by a car driven by a 
40yearold schoolteacher who sped off as the women were thrown to 
the pavement both died 
the deaths reignited a debate in los angeles about crosswalks 
now being eliminated by the hundreds in a citywide repaving project 
neighborhood residents set up a shrine at the intersection and 
demanded signals and crosswalk markings but traffic engineers 
decided white lines on the pavement wouldnt offer a solution 
instead they installed stop signs 
experts agree that in some cases having no crosswalk actually 
is safer than having the painted lines on the street studies show 
that markings often increase a pedestrians chance of being hit 
especially at intersections with no lights or signs because of a 
false sense of security 
the feeling that youre safe in that crosswalk is definitely a 
facade said sgt doug shur with the los angeles police 
department its just onesixteenth of an inch of raised white 
paint on the pavement 
a 1987 federal highway administration report found marked 
crosswalks usually were safer than unmarked ones but studies of 
markings at intersections uncontrolled by lights or signs found 
just the opposite 
in los angeles 42 of the 157 pedestrians killed in 1988 were 
struck in marked crosswalks compared to 23 in unmarked crossings 
the majority of the dead were jaywalking 
in long beach a study of 10 years of accidents found eight 
times as many pedestrianinvolved collisions at marked crosswalks 
as unmarked crossings 
a 1970 san diego study of 400 marked and unmarked intersections 
all without signals found twice as many pedestrians were struck in 
marked crosswalks as in unmarked said bruce herms author of the 
study 
the evidence seemed to indicate that pedestrians tended to be 
more trusting in the marked crosswalks trusted the motorist to 
see said herms but the motorist said the first i knew the 
pedestrian was there was when i heard the bump on the car 
his advice dont rely upon the painted lines to stop the 
automobile 
according to fred ranck head of the pedestrian safety program 
for the national safety council in chicago the trouble is that 
many cities have put in crosswalks where they shouldnt have been 
in the first place primarily for political reasons 
the painted lines have done nothing to halt injury and death at 
the intersection of eighth and concord streets in the boyle heights 
neighborhood of los angeles where residents have demanded a 
traffic light 
in the twilight of nov 28 9yearold juanita martinez was 
struck by a car and killed as the driver rushed to work on jan 6 
two 14yearold girls walking to school were hit by a car and 
injured 
cities such as san diego and los angeles have begun removing 
crosswalks at such uncontrolled intersections to increase safety 
san diego has removed 700 crosswalks since 1970 long beach has 
eliminated 700 since 1975 los angeles has wiped away more than 200 
and plans to delete up to 300 more 
herms said that in san diego pedestrian deaths in the six years 
before the deletions were 157 from 1971 to 1976 117 pedestrians 
were killed 
nationwide one in six people killed in a traffic accident is a 
pedestrian about 8500 died in 1987 the most recent year counted 
pedestrians really are the forgotten stepchild in traffic 
safety ranck said 
especially in new york and la said richard retting new 
york citys deputy assistant commissioner for safety everyones 
in a rush and theyre just not thinking for that moment 
authorities eventually caught the woman they say was driving the 
car that struck mrs haskell and her friend beatrice margaret 
buocz pleaded innocent to hitandrun driving and awaits trial 
police detective robert smith said it appears ms buocz was not 
speeding but simply didnt see the women 
experts agree that the pedestrian usually is at fault 
the majority of pedestrians killed in traffic violated a 
traffic law or committed an obviously unsafe act says the 
american automobile association 
no one may ever know who was at fault in the deaths of mrs 
haskell and mrs selden but police believe the elderly women took 
care 
the lesson is when you cross the street make sure that the 
cars are stopping said shur regardless of who is right or 
wrong the pedestrian always comes out last and they usually 
come out dead last

is the primetime soap opera one of 
televisions most popular formats an endangered species or is it 
just changing form 
abc canceled dynasty after nine years cbs renewed 
dallas knots landing and falcon crest but the luster 
is gone dallas and knots landing barely made it into the 
top 30 highestrated shows the past season 
no new primetime soap is on the horizon the last effort was 
nbcs a year in the life two seasons ago 
but the form has evolved into something else 
the foremost exponent of the new format is nbcs la law 
its not as outrageous as dallas its not as melodramatic as 
knots landing but the essential elements are there a strong 
dramatic narrative ongoing stories and evolving characters 
other shows in this new format are abcs thirtysomething and 
china beach and cbs wiseguy and tour of duty 
i dont know the difference anymore between the socalled soap 
operas and la law and wiseguy except the story arcs are 
shorter said david jacobs the creator of dallas and knots 
landing i think that the fading of the other shows other than 
knots landing is just that theyre old and old shows tend to 
fade 
esther shapiro who created dynasty declined to comment 
but has said in the past she thinks the primetime soap opera has 
undergone a metamorphosis into such shows as la law and 
thirtysomething 
jacobs said thirtysomething reminds him of the early years 
of knots landing when it was a little softer and more 
selfconscious he said knots landing evolved into a 
melodrama because it needed more excitement to hold the audience 
cbs dallas was the highestrated show for three seasons and 
second for two others the who shot jr episode in 1980 broke 
all viewing records up to that time 
in the 198485 season when the soaps reached their peak abcs 
dynasty ranked first and dallas was second cbs knots 
landing and falcon crest were 9th and 10th for the year 
the granddaddy of the primetime soap opera was abcs peyton 
place which ran twice and sometimes three times a week between 
1964 and 69 abc followed it with harold robbins the 
survivors an illconceived show that lasted only briefly in 
1969 other failed efforts cbs sons and daughters in 1974 
cbs beacon hill in 1975 cbs executive suite in 1976 and 
nbcs web in 1978 
the current cycle of shows began with abcs rich man poor man 
book ii which ran for one season after the rich man poor 
man miniseries 
i certainly had that in my head when i did dallas said 
jacobs the continuing saga seemed a reasonable thing to develop 
for television 
after dallas in 1979 jacobs launched knots landing the 
following year cbs falcon crest began in 1982 
numerous other soaps were attempted cbs secrets of midland 
heights nbcs flamingo road cbs emerald point nas 
nbcs for love and honor abcs call to glory nbcs 
berringers nbcs yellow rose nbcs gangster 
chronicles cbs hometown nbcs a year in the life and 
even nbcs crime story 
prior to the soaps and serials each episode of a series started 
from scratch the characters never learned anything from the 
previous weeks experience 
i think shows like la law and knots landing are the 
future of network television said jacobs we cant compete 
with whats on cable we cant do nudity if youre doing an 
actionadventure you cant compete with rambo the one thing 
network television can offer is a continuing drama and an 
involvement with characters who change you cant go back to shows 
where the characters never changed or learned anything 
jacobs said serials are difficult to launch because they demand 
such an investment from the audience you are there not only to 
watch this week but next week and the week after that he said 
thats why serials have never worked on saturday night people 
cant make the commitment the biggest mistake some producers have 
made is beginning a show as a serial you have to win the audience 
first dallas and knots landing didnt begin as serials 
although abc has pulled the plug on dynasty as a weekly 
series that may not be the end of blake carrington alexis and the 
others the network is considering a twohour movie for next season 
to wrap up the loose ends and solve the cliffhanger that ended its 
nine years on the air

as they get ready for summer getaways in the 
weeks ahead many american vacationers will be stocking up on 
swimming suits suntan lotion and travelers checks 
despite the advent of the credit card and bank teller machine 
networks reported sales of travelers checks keep rising steadily 
98 years after an employee of american express co named marcellus 
berry hit on the idea 
american express which remains the bestknown travelers check 
purveyor says its worldwide sales of the checks increased from 
138 billion in 1983 to 211 billion last year 
the credit union national association a trade group says its 
sales of checks to credit unions jumped more than 50 percent in 
1988 
cuna attributes this growth to a booming travel and vacation 
market at just about all age levels of the population from the 
youngest of the baby boomers to the rapidly growing ranks of older 
americans 
the appeal of travelers checks of course is that they serve as 
a kind of marked money nearly as handy as cash but protected 
unlike cash from the hazards of theft or loss 
in fact says the cuna less than 1 percent of the travelers 
checks that are issued become the subject of refund claims 
nevertheless if you are going to take the trouble of getting 
them for the protection they offer financial advisers say it 
makes sense to handle them properly and wisely 
first of all they suggest familiarize yourself beforehand with 
the procedure for obtaining a refund in the places you plan to 
visit 
then you need a plan for safe separate storage during the trip 
of the documents that show what checks you have bought and their 
serial numbers 
among the travel safety tips it offers american express 
recommends drawing up in duplicate a list of the travelers checks 
you will be carrying along with numbers of such other things as 
credit cards passports and insurance policies 
keep one copy with you and leave the other at home with a 
friend or business associate the company says it will speed 
replacement or recovery in case of theft or loss 
each time you cash a travelers check write down the amount 
and number of the check the place you cashed it and the time and 
date it adds that way you will know at any time the amounts 
and numbers of checks that still may be lost or stolen 
all this may sound like a lot of trouble to take more than a 
lot of people would actually bother with after all you are going 
on a vacation not to an accounting convention 
but the whole idea of travelers checks is security against loss 
of your money and against the disruption of your trip 
few institutions that sell travelers checks charge onerous fees 
for them if youre inclined to shop around however you may well 
find a place where they are available more cheaply 
at the end of a trip it makes sense to cash in any remaining 
checks quickly to put the money to use elsewhere 
a few years back one firm suggested in its advertising that you 
keep one or two unused checks in your wallet more or less 
permanently as a sort of emergency reserve 
whether that appeals to you or not you should bear in mind that 
the suggestion does not come from a disinterested source companies 
that make travelers checks profit from the float earning 
investment returns on your money between the time you buy a 
travelers check and the time you spend it 
so hanging on to an old travelers check is pretty much the same 
thing as putting it into a savings account that pays no interest at 
all

a key producer of an evangelical declaration 
stressing conversion of jews says it was aimed mainly at some 
fellow christians and not at jews whom it has keenly offended 
theyre incensed by it so are some christians they say its 
contrary to developing jewishchristian reciprocity 
as the conflict smouldered the chairman of the panel that 
produced the document the rev vernon grounds of denver colo 
seminary said it was directed at an inhouse issue among the 
churches 
a movement is gaining ground that repduiates the new testament 
mandate and says its not necessary to evangelize the jewish 
people he said in a telephone interview 
more and more this position is coming to the fore we feel it 
imperative to reaffirm the historic christian position that the 
gospel be preached to the jew first 
the declaration asserts that jews can be saved only by accepting 
christ this contrasts with a developing historic rapprochement 
between judaism and christianity as both bound to god 
that evolving concord expressed lately in official statements 
of a growing list of mainline denominations protestant and roman 
catholic has marked a watershed in religious annals 
it comes after centuries of christian demeaning of jews 
a major shift has occured among mainline protestant churches 
and roman catholics but its not without some challenges and 
pain said retired ohio episcopal bishop john h burt 
burt of marqwuette mich who chaired development of a new 
episcopal church stance toward judaism said the trend has 
triggered some backlash 
some of that backlash was indicated in the evangelical 
declaration drawn up by 15 scholars in april and since endorsed by 
the world evangelical fellowship which estimates its global 
adherents at 100 million 
some church leaders have retreated from embracing the task of 
evangelizing jews maintaining that gods covenant with 
israel is sufficient for all times the declaration says in its 
preamble 
however it says the biblical status of jews as gods people 
cannot save them without accepting christ and that gods covenant 
with jews was conditioned upon the foreordained sacrifice of 
christ 
while the declaration repudiates past persecutions of jews and 
condemns antisemitism the declaration describes evangelizing of 
jewish people as a priority and discounts dialogue without that 
purpose 
the biblical hope for jewish people centers on their being 
restored through faith in christ to their proper place as branches 
of gods olive tree from which they are at present broken off 
the declaration says 
jewish leaders voiced outrage rabbi alexander schindler 
president of the union of american hebrew congregations called the 
declaration retrograde and primitive 
it is a desperate attempt to stop the clock of progress in 
interrlegious relations jews have no interest in dialogue with 
those who feel that they alone are worthy of gods grace 
rabbi a james rudin interrelgious affairs director of the 
american jewish committee said the document is shot through with 
the ancient christian teaching of contempt for jews and judiasm 
he said if the declarations objective of converting jews were 
totally successful it would mean the end of jewish life 
throughout the world amounting to spiritual genocide 
the rev galin hiestand of wheaton ill north american 
director of the world evangelical fellowship said it had realized 
that making the declaration would not be a popular thing to do 
but we had no alternative other that to affirm jesus christ as 
the promised messiah and acceptance of him as the only basis for 
salvation 
many noted theologians and actions by several denomination the 
episcopal church presbyterian church usa and united church of 
christ have underscored the continuing validity of gods covenant 
with jews 
the rev a roy eckhard a united methodist specialist on 
christianjewish ties and longtime head of the religion department 
at lehigh university in bethlehem pa termed the change in church 
attitudes a revolution 
its the wave of the future a very solid thing so different 
from what has gone on for centuries he said the other point 
of view is simply wrong and centuries of church history doesnt 
make it right 
he said the deepended new testament understanding is that gods 
covenant with the jews was opened to the gentiles through 
christ its not a denial of roots but a rediscovery of roots 
he said the other side is not really being faithful to 
scripture but does have a little bit of partial truth that 
christians must not close the church doors to jews or anyone the 
doors must always be open 
grounds a conservative baptist who led production of the new 
evangelical declaration said we hope it will be wholesome rather 
than divisive in its outcome 
christianity is rooted in the old testament and we are 
grateful for the jewish scripture he said but the jewish 
covenant with god no longer applies he said judaism is no 
longer a redemptive religion

the recently merged evangelical lutheran church 
in america ended its first fiscal year with a deficit of 158 
million spending 1043 million but with income of only 885 
million 
bishop herbert w chilstrom head of the 5 millionmember 
denomination says the situation requires some painful 
adjustments in the coming months but the longrange picture 
for the church is good 
he says members apparently have increased giving at the local 
level but cut back in giving to the churchwide organization on the 
assumption it was doing all right 
among steps being taken to deal with the problem are a freeze on 
staff enlargements limiting salary boosts to a maximum of 25 
percent and reducing the number of persons traveling to regional 
events 
the deficit is being covered by reserves and proceeds from sale 
of property mainly former headquarters of the three merging 
denominations before locating here

after years of toil and following two heart 
operations james garner has a new way of working he smacks golf 
balls and reads until his doorbell rings 
if his partner in a production company peter duchow is waiting 
outside he knows its time to dust off his actors cap 
i say go ahead pete work and pretty soon it gets to the 
point where he has to get me in on it and suddenly im working 
again and dont realize it garner says 
but slowing down wasnt easy for the 61yearold garner who was 
once described as the last real man in america he might be 
6foot3 and robust but his body has been telling him to ease up 
for many years 
he was twice wounded during the korean war and was awarded the 
purple heart each time in his first year on the hit tv series 
the rockford files garner ripped up his knee always ready for 
an encore he did it again the next year hes also broken his tail 
bone and his ribs and injured tendons and ligaments add to that 
ulcers arthritis disintegrating disks in his back and occasional 
bouts of depression 
but the stakes escalated last year when he was hospitalized 
because of a weakness in the aorta the main artery carrying blood 
from the heart he underwent a bypass operation and surgery on the 
aorta 
it wasnt very good news garner recalled wryly 
the operations slowed him down a little bit and made me smell 
the roses a little more i guess he says 
now hes happiest when hes making a birdie on the golf course 
or when hes home quietly reading happiness for me is relief 
from stress the actor said 
garner gave up tobacco after 45 years and plays with beads to 
keep his hands busy and away from cigarettes but stopping smoking 
wasnt easy for an actor who first appeared on television in 
commercials promising that winston tastes good like a cigarette 
should 
thats the way i did it and a year later they did a whole ad 
campaign to cross like out and put as in its place he 
recalled with a chuckle although hes not sure whether it was 
wrong in the script or if he made it wrong 
however the star of tvs the rockford files and 
maverick and dozens of movies including the americanization 
of emily the great escape and victorvictoria still 
occasionally cheats and lights up 
i would love to have one every few minutes but thats out of 
the question he confessed 
garner and duchow have produced two television specials my 
name is bill w the story of the founders of alcoholics 
anonymous which was broadcast last month and promise the 
198687 emmy awardwinning story of a brother whose carefree 
lifestyle is threatened when he is forced to care for his mentally 
ill brother 
i like stories that have to do with the human condition but 
im not a crusader said garner who was nominated for an academy 
award in 1986 as best actor for his performance in the movie 
murphys romance 
garner was born in norman okla the youngest of mildred and 
weldon bumgarners three sons his father was a carpetlayer his 
mother died when he was young he quit school at age 16 to join the 
merchant marines in 1944 and dropped in and out of high schools as 
he roamed the country for several years shaking off the shyness 
that resulted from years of berating by an overbearing stepmother 
at age 17 he worked at a hollywood gas station and got to know 
paul gregory who became a successful producer eight years later 
after a year at the university of oklahoma and working for his 
fathers los angeles business garner drove by paul gregory and 
associates and decided to see if gregory had been serious years 
earlier when he told him he should become an actor 
he said he saw a parking space in front of gregorys building 
if that space hadnt been there i would never have driven 
around the block to look for one he once said 
gregory hired him for the stage production of the caine mutiny 
court martial and garner worked his way from a nonspeaking role 
as a juror to a leading role on tour 
he married actress lois clarke 32 years ago they raised two 
daughters one of whom became an elementary school teacher and the 
other a nashville country singer 
garner cherishes traits he traces to his maternal grandfather a 
cherokee indian stoicism stubborn you bet dogged 
trustworthy like a boy scout 
i think i have a lot of the old west values of your word is 
your bond honesty and that sort of thing that doesnt seem to 
hold much value anymore to people he said 
hes been cited as an example of a man with values because he 
has resisted the pitfalls of the me generation and its 
companion attitude of im going to get mine no matter who i step 
on 
i come from oklahoma where were still kind of simple folks 
he said 
i have to live with my own conscience when i go to bed at 
night and my conscience doesnt keep me awake ive lived by my 
rules whatever they may be

editors note fifty years ago on june 6 a group of 
neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a 
scaleddown field in williamsport pa they called it the little 
league today more than 25 million young boys and girls play on 
140000 little league baseball teams in the united states and 33 
foreign countries but despite its immense popularity the 
organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the little 
league turned out 
</TEXT>

when you drive south on route 15 in 
northcentral pennsylvania just as you top the crest of bald eagle 
mountain pull over and cast your gaze on the valley below 
if there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of little 
league baseball you are looking at it 
the susquehanna river winds down from the green allegheny hills 
through a town of 40000 souls who live in clapboard houses with 
porch swings and shade trees a timeless scene off a postcard 
labeled america 
an american flag large enough to cover a small infield draws 
your eye to the north bank of the river it flies proudly in front 
of a 45acre complex of buildings and ball fields the 
international headquarters of little league inc 
little league baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this 
year boys who played in the first little league game on june 6 
1939 have grandchildren playing in the league a little league 
ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities 
villages and suburbs across the land 
a threeteam league of 30 williamsport boys in 1939 was the 
seedbed for what little league inc today calls the largest sports 
organization in the world today 25 million youths play on 
140000 teams in 6000 leagues in the united states and 33 foreign 
countries 
of course i had no idea what little league would become 
says carl stotz who founded the league while working as a clerk in 
a lumber yard all i envisioned at the time was a neighborhood 
program some of what it has become i am not in favor of 
at 79 stotz still lives in williamsport he is a man with an 
incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save 
receipts 
he can show you for example that the total expenses for the 
first little league season came to 17463 that the collection 
taken up at the first game netted 142 that the first boysized 
catchers mask ordered from chicago and which he still has cost 
167 the first dozen balls 2 the first years deficit was 
3672 which stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did every 
year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black 
now little league inc has assets of more than 10 million and 
a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters it charges each 
of those 140000 teams a charter fee of 14 each year and earns 
millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the 
little league name which is copyrighted and the logo which stotz 
designed the business of little league is unquestionably big 
league 
stotzs memory of how it all began is vivid 
one august day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two 
nephews jimmy and harold gehron ages 6 and 8 in his back yard at 
1108 isabella st running backward he tripped over the jagged 
stumps of a cutdown lilac bush and bruised his ankle his left 
ankle 
i sat on the back steps there he recalls pointing 
rubbing my ankle 
i said to the boys how would you like to play on a regular 
team with uniforms a new ball for every game and bats you can 
really swing 
one of them said uncle tuck thats what they called me 
who would we play 
i decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams 
stotz gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and 
went to a flat field at memorial park where picknickers played 
softball

editors note the opening of the johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore 100 years ago this month and the hopkins medical school 
four years later greatly influenced the way america trains its 
doctors besides setting the standards of medical education 
hopkins researchers also have made remarkable contributions to the 
practice of medicine in the 20th century 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the chief swept into the hospital lobby 
handing his hat coat and books to the waiting crowd dispensing a 
cheery greeting and a wave of his hand 
he led them past the outstretched arms of the 10foot marble 
christ and down the long corridor to the first ward gathering at a 
bed spectators focused their attention on the patient and on the 
chief 
william osler a showman with high forehead and the bold 
mustache of a pirate was in his element he was teaching medical 
students at the bedside and he was making history 
for this was johns hopkins hospital around the turn of the 
century and osler was among a small group of physicians who were 
helping change the way america trained its doctors 
with the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the hopkins medical 
school in 1893 osler and his colleagues became the first american 
medical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students 
they also put a new emphasis on research and on learning by 
experience 
from the outset johns hopkins embodied a conception of 
medical education as a field of graduate study rooted in basic 
science and hospital medicine that was eventually to govern all 
institutions in the country wrote sociologist paul starr in his 
pulitzer prizewinning book the social transformation of 
american medicine 
this month marks 100 years of medicine at johns hopkins medical 
institutions 
the hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medical 
education in the past century researchers there developed the 
radical mastectomy for breast cancer built the first renal 
dialysis apparatus crystallized insulin and made many other key 
contributions 
the hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time when 
america had some good medical schools but also many poor ones 
medical historian lester s king said in a recent interview 
no national standards yet governed medical education 
schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics where 
students could get some training with patients most schools could 
not offer much bedside experience 
in general american medical schools also lacked laboratory 
facilities and conducted only limited original research germany 
by contrast was leading a scientific transformation of medicine 
that began in the mid19th century fueled by advances in 
microscopy chemistry and physiology 
the hopkins trustees had some major advantages rather than 
battling entrenched dogma and professors they could start from 
scratch and rather than having to persuade a hospital to let 
students into wards they could make the hospital a teaching tool 
from the beginning 
when it came to opening the medical school however they also 
had a big problem 
as trustees of the estate of baltimore financier johns hopkins 
they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment in 
american history the 7 million hopkins left upon his death in 
1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university 
but even as the hospital opened its doors in 1889 the financial 
prospects for opening the medical school were shaky income from 
the railroad stock that made up the university endowment had dried 
up 
four wealthy welleducated daughters of the trustees offered to 
raise the needed money provided the school would admit women on 
equal terms as men the trustees agreed 
but by december 1892 the women had raised less than half the 
500000 the school needed other medical schools knowing of the 
delay were trying to lure the hopkins medical faculty away 
finally mary garrett a member of the womens committee 
offered to donate the balance for a price the school would have 
to admit only students who had a bachelors degree and a reading 
knowledge of french and german 
the trustees swallowing hard at requirements they feared might 
drive away many prospective students accepted it is lucky that 
we got in as professors osler told a fellow faculty member we 
could never enter as students 
it was a relief when 18 students including three women showed 
up to form the first class

the medical curriculum hopkins provided was marked not so much 
by innovation as by a combination of features that had appeared in 
europe and scattered american schools 
it was an ambitious enterprise even apart from requiring a 
college degree for entry few other schools provided wellequipped 
laboratories in basic science for teachers and students hopkins 
aimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on of 
existing knowledge 
the idea was to give the world men who can not only sail by 
the old charts but who can make new and better ones for the use of 
others said john shaw billings a civil war battlefield surgeon 
who became a key architect of the medical school curriculum 
hopkins also made a policy of learning by doing both in the 
laboratory and in the hospital with osler as their mentor at the 
bedside students took medical histories of patients performed 
physical examinations conducted routine laboratory tests and 
followed their patients course 
as osler put it the student began with the patient continued 
with the patient ended his studies with the patient using books 
and lectures as tools means to an end 
the school made fulltime jobs out of teaching basic science 
rather than using local physicians to teach part time as most 
other schools did the fulltime idea later extended to 
instructors of medical practice allowed hopkins to go outside the 
local community to lure topnotch faculty members 
eventually the school also offered lengthy training in medical 
specialties to its students who had finished the four years of the 
regular curriculum 
the result of all this was such that in 1901 harvards eliot 
congratulated hopkins university president daniel gilman on a 
prodigious advancement of medical teaching 
the men who led the way were the big four 
one was osler who had come from philadelphia to become 
professor of medicine at the school and physicianinchief at the 
hospital the author of a classic medical text osler became one of 
the nations most highly regarded physicians 
joining him was william halsted a shy and excrutiatingly 
meticulous surgeon he became wellknown for such innovations as 
the radical mastectomy for breast cancer and his training of other 
surgeons 
then there was william welch a genial rotund pathology 
professor who became a power behind reforms in medical education 
and stimulated interest in medical philanthropy 
finally there was howard kelly the gynecological surgeon who 
developed and improved that art he took pleasure in quick 
flashy operating one student wrote later hed be in and out 
of the abdomen almost before you knew it all the time talking and 
illustrating what he was doing or about to do 
of the 17 original hospital buildings only three remain hemmed 
in by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medical 
school 
the scene today at hopkins would astonish the big four 
faint rock music nudges the quiet of a whitewalled laboratory 
as bert vogelstein 39 holds up a dark gray sheet of xray film 
it shows several series of smudged black lines 
during the days of the big four physicians were just beginning 
to understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells now the 
smudged lines on vogelsteins film are helping to explain those 
abnormalities 
victor mckusick 67 arose shortly after 5 am one recent day 
at his baltimore home he drank some coffee read the paper picked 
up a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small tape 
recorder it was time to catalog a new human gene 
when the hopkins medical school was founded the idea of genes 
was not yet generally accepted for the work of austrian monk 
gregor mendel in the 1860s was not yet widely known today 
mckusick maintains a list of human genes accessible by computer 
around the world the entry he dictated before breakfast that 
morning was number 4584 
but while medicine has advanced greatly since hopkins began 
some things stay the same notes hopkins medical historian a 
mcgehee harvey 
a committee that reviewed the hopkins medical curriculum 
recently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing and of not only 
teaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creating 
new knowledge harvey said 
its a process of rediscovery he said with a smile they 
rediscovered all the principles that were here when the place 
started

editors note its a free high school for catholic boys 
drawing students from all around new york city and while other 
parochial schools struggle with rising tuitions and dwindling 
enrollments regis high school in manhattan has managed to afford 
5 million in improvements in recent years thanks to the 
generosity of donors largely alumni the school also has managed 
to maintain a standard of academic excellence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the unusual story behind the founding of regis 
high school is captured in the latin words engraved in stone above 
the columns on its classical facade deo et patriae pietas 
christiana erexit 
or as even the most plodding of latin scholars who ever trod 
the corridors of this reknowned jesuit high school might translate 
built by christian piety for god and country 
seventyfive years after a rich widow anonymously gave her 
pastor 500000 to build a free school for catholic boys regis is 
still giving full scholarships to every student it admits 
it draws the cream of the academic crop mainly from parochial 
grammar schools in the five boroughs of new york the surrounding 
threestate suburbs and sometimes even farther afield 
everyone thinks im crazy to come into the city says mark 
mazzetti 14 a freshman who spends three hours a day traveling 
back and forth from princeton nj 
for luis taveras 17 a senior who chose regis over the bronx 
high school of science the trip to school is a 30minute subway 
ride from the bronx 
i love it here taveras says when you come from the 
bronx its really challenging to grow up in a different kind of 
world this school is a meeting ground for people from so many 
different backgrounds 
todays 501 regis students are getting their free education 
valued by school officials at over 24000 thanks not only to the 
generosity of the original benefactor and her family who over the 
years gave millions to keep the school running but its 7500 
alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in their 
own right 
about half the 33 million budget comes from interest on the 
schools investments the rest is raised each year from alumni 
foundations and other sources 
each year the costs go up at least 200000 says the rev 
james j fischer sj the president since 1980 thats not 
going to end 
but while other catholic schools struggle with rising tuitions 
and contracting enrollments regis has been able to pour 5 million 
in recent years into expanding science labs and other major 
renovations of its building on east 84th street two blocks from 
central park the top faculty salaries will hover near 40000 this 
fall 
last years seniors scored an average of 1273 on the scholastic 
aptitude test 369 points above the national average many 
graduates attend select colleges including 84 who went on to ivy 
league colleges in the past four years alone 
more than a third of the students come from families with 
incomes below 30000 a year and 40 percent are the children of 
immigrants from ireland puerto rico china the philippines 
italy cuba haiti and three dozen other countries 
the school largely white for decades now has a 28 percent 
minority enrollment including 60 hispanic students 12 percent 
51 asian 10 percent and 28 black 6 percent unlike many 
parochial schools especially in big cities it does not admit 
noncatholics 
each fall on the first saturday in november about 900 students 
take a standardized admissions test students also are judged on 
their elementary school grades activities and for the finalists 
an interview before the 130 scholarship winners are chosen shortly 
before christmas 
most of those admitted score in the top 5 percent on 
standardized tests a common cutoff for the gifted

editors note he likes to laugh and make others laugh but 
theres a serious side to ed zern hes concerned about whats 
happening to the planet and its creatures thats why more than 30 
years ago he established a program to give conservationists a pat 
on the back 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
outdoorsman and writer ed zern a 
conservationist with a sense of humor is still spouting the 
oneliners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers 
i prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work the 
78yearold zern likes to say 
and 
fishermen are born honest but they get over it 
some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of 
string with a worm on one end and a damn fool on the other this is 
a silly definition of course for many fishermen use flies instead 
of worms 
fish is brain food people who eat fish have large 
welldeveloped brains people with large welldeveloped brains 
dont fish its that simple 
beneath the mischievous grin however is a serious concern 
about what could lie ahead unless americans start paying more 
attention to the world around them 
thirtyfive years ago we didnt have waste products of 
nuclear plants zern says we didnt have a lot of the poisons 
that are poisoning the atmosphere we didnt know that spray cans 
could destroy our ozone layer 
zern never imagined things would become as bad as they have 
i thought something would be done about it measures would be 
taken he says unfortunately it didnt work out that way 
the bearded hoaryheaded author of the exit laughing column 
in field amp stream magazine occasionally mistaken in the past for 
another avid outdoorsman the late ernest hemingway is doing what 
he can to increase public awareness 
zern is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology 
entitled hunting and fishing from a to zern he also is creator 
of the moreorless imaginary madison avenue rod gun bloody mary 
and labrador retriever benevolent association whose motto is 
keep your powder your trout flies and your martinis dry 
its implicit in everything he does the respect for the 
outdoors the love for it says maggie nichols field amp streams 
managing editor 
that zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards 
program zern founded in 1954 with corporate backing his aim was 
and still is to give conservationconscious folks a slap on the 
back 
his chevron conservation awards program believed to be the 
oldest privately supported program of its kind in the country has 
recognized 663 individuals and 101 organizations over the years 
the 1989 finalists were honored may 17 in washington dc 
each year zern helps whittle down the list of up to 150 
nominees some of them he acknowledges fit the stereotypical 
image of the conservationist 
little old lady in tennis shoes they exist and theyre 
charming people usually he says chuckling 
his alltime favorite finalist is a 70yearold pennsylvania 
game warden who was honored in the late 50s the mans wife who 
nominated her husband for the award thanked zern profusely 
following the ceremony 
this little old lady came up to me and said mr zern i want 
to thank you for being involved in this and to tell you what a 
wonderful thing it was for me zern says i said well i 
should think it would be wonderful to have all these people here to 
honor your husband 
she looked sort of surprised she said oh no it isnt 
that weve been married 52 years and this is the first time weve 
ever stayed at a hotel

editors note one of the managers of a connecticut bar 
himself a recovering alcoholic decided adults needed a place to go 
to dance and party without being exposed to booze like the 
nonalcoholic clubs for teenagers so one night a week the night 
life vip lounge becomes club soda where the drinks are no stronger 
than the name implies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the dance music pulses through the art 
deco nightclub with its mirrored walls as bartenders hurriedly 
stir shake and blend exotic drinks 
the adult crowd at club soda is partying this friday night but 
they are all sober there is no alcohol in the drinks 
its a major nightclub it has everything but the booze 
says joseph w perugini one of the managers of club soda a friday 
night nonalcoholic alternative for adults who want to party 
without getting drunk 
there are people out there that just cant drink and they have 
nowhere to go 
there are many nightclubs offering dancing and a club ambiance 
without alcohol for teenagers but a boozeless bar for adults is 
unusual says peruginis partner thomas rowlay 
we could pack them in with kids but at the same time thats 
not what we were looking for rowlay says 
except for friday nights club soda is actually the night life 
vip lounge a fullservice bar and the decision to ban booze each 
friday night typically a busy night for bars was something 
personal for perugini a recovering alcoholic 
im recovering and ive met through my past two years out 
there a different breed of people that enjoy life without the 
sauce perugini says 
im just tired of reading just say no to drugs and say no to 
booze youve got to do something anybody can say that its time 
we show people how to live i feel real good about it 
perugini credits night life owners pat scarpa and dave destazio 
his employers for a number of years with giving him the chance to 
try the nobooze bar 
its an idea that night life beverage manager lester j szmajlo 
endorses 
youve got people that maybe shouldnt be drinking that dont 
want to drink and are off the sauce who want to come out and have 
that same atmosphere a party night and not get drunk szmajlo 
says 
the club soda drink menu runs the gamut from the everpopular 
shirley temple ginger ale with a dash of grenadine to more exotic 
items such as the lemon spritzer pineburst and a host of frozen 
coladas as well a mineral water cappuccino and expresso coffees 
the help has been very supportive of this and its tough to 
find bartenders that will work without getting the tips that 
theyre accustomed to in a real bar perugini says 
the club which opened feb 27 averages 130 to 150 people a 
night perugini says most nondrinkers are discovering the club by 
wordofmouth although the club purchased a few ads in the local 
newspaper 
michelle killiany 19 of bristol heard about the club in an 
alcoholism recovery program in which she participates 
i dont miss not having drinks not at all she says i 
like it here a lot the mirrors and the nonalcoholic drink hang 
around youll see its a gas its worth the drive 
there is a doorman at club soda not to check ids but to check 
for boozers and potential troublemakers the doorman does not admit 
anyone who has been drinking 
some people may come in for a goof but thats on them 
perugini says theyre the ones who paid the five bucks to come 
in and walk right out

editors note its something of a cross between ripleys 
believe it or not and 60 minutes which may have inspired its 
name soviet televisions rapidfire news show 600 seconds 
which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the 
establishment has become immensely popular since it went on the 
air before mikhail gorbachev came to power such a program would 
have been unthinkable in the soviet union 
</TEXT>

a lost bull roams a busy city street 
prostitutes woo foreign customers a holiday bombing rips off a 
mans legs 
these and other eyeopening images are flashing across soviet 
television screens as glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs 
drive for openness goes video 
traditionally the kremlin has used staterun television as it 
did other media to reach the masses with propaganda rather than 
programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just 
plain fun the airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on 
subjects such as the grain harvest the leadership still commands 
unlimited time 
but gorbachev is a more lively tv personality than his 
predecessors and frequently turns to television to make speeches 
and broadcast his streetside talks with people for the first time 
this winter parliamentary candidates debated each other on 
television 
western music videos are shown routinely space bridges 
bring the uncensored views of western studio audiences into soviet 
living rooms and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives 
soviets a glimpse of western lifestyles 
one trailblazing program which featured the offbeat stories 
about the bull the prostitutes and the bombing is 600 
seconds a fastpaced live show on leningrad television that has 
become a smash hit since its premiere in december 1987 
six days a week 15 million people in leningrad moscow and 
other regions can switch on their tv sets to catch up on the latest 
sensations from the soviet unions secondlargest city 
600 seconds is like a cross between ripleys believe it or 
not and 60 minutes leningraders have nicknamed the show 
our city scandalmonger 
at 10 pm a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes 
of news reports read live by a studio announcer and videotaped 
reports presented rapidfire in a downtoearth style a digital 
clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the 
remaining seconds 
nevzorovs irreverence surfaces in every broadcast he relishes 
stirring up the town with what he calls sensations the program 
consists largely of crime reports but also has a heavy dose of the 
bizarre such as a story about the citys dirtiest toilet 
nevzorov the shows cocreator and main anchor races around 
this city of 49 million people all day to gather material for his 
mondaythroughsaturday broadcast relying heavily on tips from the 
public and police 
he has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go 
along with such status in the west no secretary no private 
office no chauffeurdriven limousine and a salary of only 475 a 
month 
nevzorov is a former horse trainer and tv scriptwriter and 
bristles when the word journalist is mentioned most soviet 
journalists he said could not come up with the stories he does 
and he doesnt agree with the western notion that journalists 
should be objective and not sensationalize the news 
the public turns to 600 seconds to fight the soviet 
bureaucracy on one recent afternoon a caller asked the program to 
prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his 
apartment window 
600 seconds and other leningrad tv programs have helped lift 
the veil from subjects such as homelessness rape prostitution 
murder and robbery and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject 
privileges of the soviet elite 
but there are still forbidden themes nevzorovs boss alexander 
a yurkov said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are 
barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary 
edward a sagalayev head of soviet tvs information department 
who is fighting to reform soviet tv said reforms can be difficult 
i also have my bosses we have our minister he has his 
deputiesand it is not always possible to overcome 
psychologically these traditions

while much of soviet television is looking more 
western the man who reads the news to millions every night prefers 
to do things the oldfashioned way 
hello comrades igor kirillov says as he peers through 
thick bifocals to begin vremya the nightly news on 
statecontrolled television 
he has uttered those same words since vremya first went on the 
air on jan 1 1968 and became a main news source for the soviet 
unions 285 million people 
while other soviet tv programs and the press are tapping 
glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness to 
air sensations about crime history or life in the west vremya 
has remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago 
when the superpowers agreed last march that us president 
ronald reagan would travel to the country he had called an evil 
empire a major announcement worldwide soviets had to sit 
through two hours of a gorbachev speech about farming and a story 
about domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from vremya 
which is russian for time 
vremya still dwells on longwinded reports about the soviet 
economy often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and therefore 
dubbed tractor news 
and in static pictures that make western producers cringe 
cameras often fix on kirillov and other announcers reading lengthy 
government statements 
vremya has its high points however when an earthquake killed 
thousands on dec 7 in armenia vremya aired a dramatic report from 
the scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks 
kirillov 57 read the news during the period of stagnation 
the conservative rule of president leonid i brezhnev and has 
continued through the glasnost years 
interviewed in vremyas tiny studio kirillov compared the 
program then and now 
earlier it was good he said through gritted teeth 
indicating some discomfort with that evaluation switching to his 
full baritone voice he added now it is also good 
other tv programs borrow the style of american broadcasts 
kirillov concedes he watches the cable news network but says he is 
sticking to his oldfashioned formal style 
a new man in charge of vremya described the ideal anchorman 
he should be a little bit of a journalist a little bit of an 
actor a little bit of a politician says edward m sagalayev 
head of soviet tvs information department 
producers are spicing up vremya with graphics foreign video 
plucked off communications satellites and shorter more 
interesting and timely reports 
sagalayev says vremya lags behind other programs because it was 
born before glasnost when there was a big difference between 
politics and real life and because it has much official and 
government information

dinah manoffs earlier work for the producers 
of empty nest almost prevented her from getting a role in the 
new nbc comedy 
the show about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenly 
finds himself living alone was created by susan harris who also 
created soap and the golden girls 
manoff plays carol weston the selfabsorbed daughter of the 
pediatrician played by richard mulligan and sister of a 
policewoman played by kristy mcnichol 
they auditioned hundreds of actresses she says everybody 
i knew went in for that role they couldnt find what they were 
looking for 
it would seem that manoff would have had an edge because she had 
played elaine lefkowitz in soap for the producers 
wittthomasharris 
but she says they didnt think i was right for the part at 
first because of the work id done in soap the characters were 
different they didnt want the new york jewish fasttalking 
tough mafia princess i played in soap id played the same kind 
of character in the movie i ought to be in pictures 
so i asked to read when i read i made sure that none of that 
was showing and they saw it and cast me 
manoff says she has a real affinity for the writing of susan 
harris 
i understand her rhythm she says i understand her 
language 
she disagrees with descriptions of carol as neurotic shes 
just terribly selfinvolved she says everything has to 
revolve around her if theres a disaster somewhere her only 
thought is how does it affect her she regularly takes her 
emotional temperature 
manoff grew up in a show business family her mother is 
actressdirector lee grant and her stepfather is producer joe 
feury last summer she worked in boys life a movie made on 
location in south carolina directed by her mother and produced by 
her stepfather 
it was very interesting she says it was kind of like 
being 14 and told to clean up your room thats the downside the 
upside is that she and i are very close friends and very admiring 
of each other as actresses and artists 
shed worked for her mother once before on a tv movie called 
a matter of sex the movie which also starred jean stapleton 
was about sexual discrimination in the workplace 
she didnt begin acting until she was 19 because her mother 
didnt want her to be a child actor she was a college film student 
briefly then quit to pursue her acting career 
manoff studied at the actors studio and made her professional 
debut in a production for pbs called the great cherub knitwear 
strike next she did a small role on the tv series welcome 
back kotter 
manoff won a tony in 1980 for her broadway role in i ought to 
be in pictures she reprised her role in the movie version 
her only other series was soap on which she played the 
daughter of a gangster and the wife of danny dallas ted wass 
her film childs play is just out and bloodhounds of 
broadway is due in september another movie a thriller called 
backfire is coming up on showtime 
she is starting a new movie called welcome home roxie 
carmichael which also stars winona ryder and jeff daniels

on one side of the stage stand the jets on the 
other side the sharks the rival gangs from west side story 
huddle around microphones and watch conductor paul gemignani on a 
small podium in the middle of a vast woodpaneled room filled with 
musicians 
its a sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of jerome 
robbins broadway are in rca records studio a on west 44th 
street 
the singers look at gemignani the conducter wearing 
headphones glances at a man standing over a control panel in a 
soundproof booth near the stage take after take is recorded until 
jay david saks is satisfied 
saks an rca records producer is the man who must capture the 
sound of jerome robbins broadway a celebration of some of the 
biggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer 
besides a suite of dances from west side story the show 
includes numbers from fiddler on the roof the king and i 
gypsy peter pan and others 
the final result released in may on two records or two 
cassettes or two compact discs is one of the most lavish original 
cast recordings ever made it includes more than 120 minutes of 
music and a 62page booklet with extensive notes on each of the 
musicals included in the show 
cast albums are very demanding says saks who has been in 
the recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast album 
guru thomas z shepard at columbia records they require a great 
deal of advance preparation and a lot of study if youre going to 
record the beethoven seventh symphony you dont have to sit 
there in advance and decide whether youre going to take it up a 
key or whether youre going to leave out the third movement 
but in the case of a broadway show you have a theatrical work 
thats designed for the stage he says and how does it 
translate to a record when you have nothing to go by except what 
youre hearing frequently you have to change the reality of what 
is happening musically to recreate more accurately the memory in 
the listener 
before the taping sessions saks wasnt sure how jerome 
robbins broadway would work on record it presented special 
problems 
most of this music is familiar and most of it has been 
recorded before he recalls for example you dont want to 
have just another recording of west side story plus theres a 
lot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show so what do 
you do with it 
saks decided to record not just the music but the feel of the 
stage production he brought in the cast to tape a lot of what he 
calls crowd material not just the singing 
in the past most broadway musicals were recorded in one day 
usually the companys day off some still are but jerome 
robbins broadway took three days spread over two weeks to 
complete 
for one reason it was twice as long as a regular cast 
recording it has a large cast 62 performers and a large 
orchestra 42 musicians plus two players added for the fiddler 
on the roof segment 
for another technical advances have allowed for more material 
to be placed on a record tape or compact disc 
saks jumped to rca in 1974 when shepard did he also became a 
producer of classical recordings supervising albums by such 
orchestras as the chicago symphony conducted by james levine and 
the philadelphia orchestra conducted by eugene ormandy but he also 
assisted shepard on some of the best cast recordings ever made 
including sunday in the park with george and sweeney todd

the 1988 tony awards show was the lowestrated 
tony program ever and the prospects dont appear much brighter for 
the 1989 extravaganza 9 pm edt sunday cbstv saluting the best 
of what has been a woeful broadway theater season 
but even last years program which was ranked no 42 in the 
nielsen ratings for that week was seen in an estimated 95 million 
homes those viewers would fill a lot of broadway theaters a fact 
not lost on the tony nominating committee all seven productions 
nominated this year for best play or best musical are still running 
and tony awards sell tickets m butterfly last seasons 
bestplay winner started to sell out after it won the top award 
alsorans such as joe turners come and gone and a walk in 
the woods quickly folded 
don mischer and david goldberg who produce the tony television 
show are optimistic about this years edition which will be 
televised live from the luntfontanne theater 
you always hope for a strong season mischer says the 
biggest thing you work for in this show is to try and keep the 
television viewer familiar with what is happening on broadway so 
that when awards are given they have some idea who the people are 
and what the plays and musicals are about if you have a really 
popular season that helps you a bit 
for the third straight year angela lansbury will serve as host 
for the show which will feature scenes or dance numbers from the 
bestplay and musical nominees among the stars scheduled to appear 
are steve martin tommy tune gwen verdon colleen dewhurst and 
richard thomas 
but the suspense should be minimal the heidi chronicles 
which has won every honor from the pulitzer prize to the new york 
drama critics circle award is a clear favorite to be tapped as 
best play wendy wassersteins look at one womans journey from the 
1960s to the present faces largely new york bill irwins 
wordless entertainment lend me a tenor a farce by ken ludwig 
about an indisposed opera star and shirley valentine willy 
russells portrait of a bored but never boring english housewife 
theres even less uncertainty about the winner in the top 
musical category the season produced one hot ticket jerome 
robbins broadway and it should easily ace the best musical 
category the telecast will feature a dance number from west side 
story the high point of the robbins show 
only two other shows black and blue and starmites 
were nominated for best musical the television presentation will 
also feature two songs from black and blue a revue of blues 
songs and tap dancing and a campy bette midlerstyle number 
hard to be diva from starmites a scifi comic strip 
musical 
with the emmys grammys and oscars the nation is basically 
familiar with those tv shows records and films nominated 
goldberg says here it is more difficult thats one of the 
reasons we are presenting segments from the plays and musicals we 
are trying to make the show more relevant for them so if bill 
irwin wins for example they have seen him and what he won for 
broadway had a bumpy year although it grossed a record 262 
million attendance declined slightly from 81 million to 8 
million and the number of productions slipped to 30 down two from 
the previous season the biggest hits were still two longrunning 
shows the phantom of the opera and les miserables and 
others such as cats and me and my girl show no sign of 
closing soon 
even those big hits couldnt guarantee high ratings for previous 
tony shows mischer is philosophic about the gradual ratings slide 
for the program over the years 
the tonys still do better than the average variety show on 
television he says if you look back on the variety shows over 
the last two or three years the ratings have simply gone down and 
down and down were living in an age of hyperactive television 
watching we sit there with a clicker in our hand go through 38 
channels and dare something to hold our interest for five seconds 
that works against variety television it works against things 
that are different if there is one act you dont like one song 
you dont like or one speech you feel is too boring youre apt to 
move on and all of that affects the ratings

international business machines corp has 
elected a new president but the technologyminded executive is not 
in line to be chairman of the worlds largest computer company 
because he is older than the current officeholder 
jack d kuehler the new president is 56 john f akers the 
chairman and chief executive is 54 
the new job for kuehler is a recognition of his contributions in 
a 31year career at the company ibm spokesman peter judice said 
tuesday in announcing kuehlers promotion 
kuehlers duties at ibms armonk ny headquarters will be 
about the same as they were in his former job of vice chairman 
although he will have slightly more authority judice said the 
vice chairmanship will be left vacant for now 
ibm has no mandatory retirement age but top executives make a 
practice of relinquishing their jobs at age 60 that gives akers 
potentially six more years as chairman 
kuehlers predecessor as president was akers himself akers 
became president in february 1983 added the title of chief 
executive in february 1985 and added the chairmanship in june 1986 
at the unusually young age of 51 
as vice chairman kuehlers job under the bylaws was to assist 
the chairman as president the bylaws state that he is to run the 
business after the chairman and can act for the chairman 
its a somewhat more substantive position judice said 
kuehler is known within ibm as a technology expert in contrast 
to akers whose main strength is in marketing 
kuehler began with the company as an associate engineer at the 
san jose research laboratory in 1958 he was elected to the board 
of directors in 1986 and executive vice president in march 1987 
he was named ibm vice chairman of the board in january 1988 and 
given responsibility for overseeing ibm united states the 
organization headed by terry lautenbach that is responsible for all 
ibm activities in the united states as well as worldwide 
development he also has overseen corporate staffs in charge of 
manufacturing and systems and programming

experts are evaluating an extralight type of 
crude oil recently discovered in at least three fields in 
southeastern mexico to determine if it is profitable for marketing 
according to a source at the state petroleum monopoly pemex 
the new toltec crude is at least 40 degrees on the american 
petroleum institutes gravity scale the lightest found so far in 
mexico said the source who spoke tuesday on condition of 
anonymity 
it was discovered at the beginning of the year at great 
depth in the juju tecominuacan paredon and other onshore fields 
that lie between the gulf of mexico port of coatzacoalcos and 
villahermosa the capital of tabasco state 
we are still making studies of the characteristics of this 
crude we are taking a series of samples and analyzing them to see 
what characteristics they have their yield and what production 
problems are involved the source added refusing to say more 
the toltec is even lighter than the olmec variety measuring 38 
to 39 degrees discovered by pemex last year in the state of 
tabasco and chiapas states and now being exported in small 
quanitities 
one of mexicos two other traditional varieties the isthmus 
measures 33 api and the heavy maya 22 the olmec has been found to

nwa inc parent of northwest airlines has 
started to evaluate buyout offers including bids by billionaire 
marvin davis and pan am corp 
davis and pan am said they met nwas tuesday afternoon deadline 
for submitting acquisition proposals but declined to outline 
specifics of their bids northwest the nations fourthlargest 
airline would not disclose who the suitors were or how many 
proposals it received 
nwas stock closed up 125 at 10725 a share tuesday on the 
new york stock exchange 
james fingeroth a spokesman for davis said the los 
angelesbased oil and real estate mogul made an offer but retained 
a limited right to pursue his outstanding hostile tender offer of 
27 billion or 90 a share for nwa the tender offer was 
scheduled to expire this afternoon but likely would be extended 
fingeroth said 
fingeroth declined to provide details of the latest davis offer 
which was submitted to nwas financial adviser first boston corp 
a spokeswoman for first boston said none of the bidders or bids 
would be disclosed 
pan am indicated earlier tuesday that it had obtained 27 
billion in bank financing for a buyout plan that it submitted by 
the deadline but declined to disclose terms of the bid the 
proposal also includes at least 400 million in new equity 
financing from a group that includes prudentialbache securities 
inc and the partnership airlie group lp 
other potential bidders that have expressed interest in nwa 
included an investment group led by former marriott corp executive 
al checchi northwests 20000member machinists union which has 
indicated it might team with an outside investor to buy a major 
stake in the airline and the wall street buyout firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co 
checchi did not return phone calls tuesday and a kkr spokesman 
in new york said the firm would not comment guy cook president of 
the international association of machinists district lodge 143 
also did not return calls seeking to determine if the union had 
submitted a buyout plan 
nwa has directed four of its outside directors to review all 
offers but chairman steven rothmeier repeatedly has said the board 
could ultimately decide not to sell 
possible alternatives for nwa include acquisition of another 
company a partial or complete liquidation of the airline a 
repurchase of shares payment of a special dividend or the sale of 
a bid stake to a white squire group that would obtain a 
controlling interest but would support current management 
northwest based in suburban eagan has said it would like to 
make a decision in the takeover battle by the end of june 
the nwa board has pushed for a single round of bidding but 
analysts said the process could start over if a higher bid arrives 
after the deadline 
cooperation from northwests unions is considered crucial to the 
bid by pan am 
industry analysts have been cautious about pan ams prospects 
because of that companys 900 million in debt 535 million in 
outstanding pension liabilities and continuing operating losses 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett told investors last week that 
should his bid for nwa succeed he plans no sales of operating 
assets and no sale or leaseback of planes 
plaskett also has said he was not counting on any revenue from a 
sale of nwas real estate in japan but would save 240 million by 
streamlining the new carriers corporate headquarters marketing 
operation maintenance and other support services

in an effort to persuade consumers it is 
reliable punctual and run by experienced workers eastern airlines 
has started advertising on television for the first time since the 
start of a bruising strike 
eastern recently began running the commercial in miami new 
york washington and atlanta at a cost of more than 500000 the 
beleaguered airline already had been advertising in major 
newspapers 
were trying to build awareness and provide some 
information george brennan easterns vice president of 
marketing said tuesday in a telephone interview 
in recent weeks miamibased eastern has been promoting its new 
plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell about 18 billion of 
assets 
the plan still must be approved by federal bankruptcy court in 
new york where eastern filed for chapter 11 protection and 
reorganization shortly after the march 4 strike began 
but us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has given eastern 
permission to sell its northeast shuttle service to developer 
donald trump for 365 million and to lease 14 boeing 727200s to 
pan am corp for 579 million over three years 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp has 
been defending his plan in meetings with media organizations such 
as usa today the associated press and nbc news 
easterns unions on the other hand are pushing for a sale of 
the entire airline 
of the 31200 pilots machinists union members and flight 
attendants employed by eastern before the strike only a few have 
crossed picket lines the airline has hired about 500 new pilots 
and 60 skilled mechanics 
easterns operations have been sharply reduced by the strike and 
it has run only about 10 percent of its normal flight schedule 
the tv ad doesnt mention the strike or bankruptcy filing it 
features a pilot who has flown for eastern for 31 years and a 
21year maintenance manager speaking to the camera while seated at 
a desk the words experience commitment and ontime 
performance flash at intervals 
the maintenance manager charlie fisher emphasizes what he 
calls the cooperative attitude and esprit de corps of eastern 
workers the pilot hal harley says that more than 5000 eastern 
flights have arrived on time since april 1 
weve got a brand new eastern airlines with a bunch of old 
pros fisher says were taking off is flashed on the screen 
the average age of newly hired pilots is 39 years up sharply 
from the prestrike average of pilots in their late 20s according 
to the company 
fisher said the commercial was made in about six hours with no 
script and no rehearsing i think most employees would have given 
anything to be in my place he said in a phone interview from 
miami i think the message we wanted to say got across 
striking pilots disagreed 
its sad to see these lost sheep supporting frank lorenzo and 
texas air said dan ashby a union spokesman 
in new york meanwhile the ad agency scali mccabe sloves inc 
announced it had won the ad contract for the trump shuttle 
advertising for easterns shuttle had been handled by lintas which 
does ads for the rest of the airline

faced with spiraling medical costs insurers 
must begin weighing not only the health benefits of new medical 
technologies but their costs and whether improved care justifies 
the added expense says a study by new englands largest health 
maintenance organization 
cost is a legitimate consideration in making coverage 
decisions said a report issued tuesday by the harvard community 
health plan even when it is established that a new more 
expensive therapy is better than the existing alternatives one 
must question whether the added benefit is worth the added cost 
the report said that without a framework to evaluate the cost 
and effectiveness of technologies decisions on what should be 
covered by insurance will be put off until time of crisis and 
then are more likely to be influenced by emotions or political 
expedience than by medical efficacy 
not only might underserving technologies be approved but the 
most deserving technologies may be overlooked the report said 
the study said new technologies must first be investigated to 
see if they represent an improvement in health care 
the study pointed to rapid adoption of tissue plasminogen 
activator a genetically engineered drug for dissolving blood clots 
that cause heart attacks the report said it remained unclear 
whether the drug at 2000 per dose is any more effective than 
streptokinase a competing drug at 200 a dose 
the report based on the findings of a threeyear study by a 
special commission appointed by harvard community health also 
suggested that older procedures be periodically evaluated 
it was once thought that the minimal dangers of circumcision 
were far outweighed by health benefits to the child and so the 
practice was commonly covered by insurers recent findings have led 
many in the medical community to question whether the procedure 
provides any health benefit the commission said 
but beyond comparing the effectiveness of various technologies 
insurers also should weigh the relative worth of new technologies 
that are proven to be more effective insurers should avoid 
treatments that cost far more than any benefits they might bring 
about are worth the study said 
few if any health plans now acknowledge considering cost in 
their coverage decisions the result is that cost effectiveness is 
rarely analyzed in any rigorous way and there is little pressure 
on the proponents of new therapies to establish their relative 
effectiveness 
those technologies that offer the greatest incremental gain 
for the incremental cost ought to be adopted first the 
commission said in addition the panel said new technologies that 
benefit the largest number of members should be selected before 
those whose benefits would be limited to a few members 
the commission suggested a cap on the cost of new technologies 
based on how many years worth of earnings ought to be devoted to 
extending a members life for one year 
as more and more resources are devoted to extending a life for 
a short time it becomes clear that choices must be made between 
competing goods the panel said 
harvard community health created the commission in 1985 after 
the brookline mass health organization became the nations first 
hmo to provide coverage for heart and liver transplants 
the increasing sophistication and cost of new technology poses 
a dilemma for all hmos and health insurers the hmo or insurer must 
balance the welfare of the individual patient against the welfare 
of all the people who pay premiums into the fund wrote thomas o 
pyle the hmos president 
by presenting this summary we do not mean to imply that hchp 
endorses all of the commissions conclusions our goal is to 
stimulate discussion in the hope that the community will benefit 
said pyle

avon products inc has told mary kay corp that 
avon isnt for sale and sees no potential benefit from combining 
the two cosmetics sellers 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive officer 
stated in a letter tuesday to john rochon mary kay vice chairman 
we strongly believe our opportunities will be better achieved by 
avon continuing with our business plan 
in the letter released by avon preston indicated mary kay has 
had a longstanding interest in avon 
as i told you last january we see no advantage to combining 
our operations through some form of leveraged buyout or other 
arrangement preston said 
the reference was to a jan 11 new york dinner meeting between 
preston and rochon avon spokesman john cox said the two had no 
other facetoface contact and spoke by telephone only once to set 
up the meeting 
during the meeting attended only by the two executives rochon 
extolled the advantages of being a private company and asked 
preston to take avon private and unite with mary kay 
rochon has been given much of the credit for the financial 
success of the the 1985 leveraged buyout of the dallasbased 
doortodoor cosmetics company 
rochon also told preston an lbo could provide preston with a 
financial windfall allowing him to leave the company in a few 
years several million dollars richer cox said 
preston replied that he wasnt interested and even if he were 
contemplating a leveraged buyout he wouldnt need mary kay to do 
it according to the avon spokesman 
although the meeting occurred in january avon had been aware of 
mary kays possible intentions earlier 
the first hint came two years ago when joel stern of the 
investment firm stern stewart amp co approached avon about the 
possibility of buying mary kay he said he was working as a 
consultant for mary kay according to cox 
avons management evaluated the idea and decided the two direct 
sellers wouldnt make a good match he said plus avon sales 
representatives probably would have reacted negatively because in 
some areas of the country the mary kay sales force is the main 
competition 
several months later in 1987 word came to avon that someone was 
preparing a hostile bid cox said at about the same time a public 
relations firm avon had hired resigned the account on the grounds 
there might be a conflict with another clients business the other 
client was mary kay 
over the two years avon has been told mary kay has searched 
unsuccessfully for investment partners to help buy avon cox said 
avon also learned mary kay wasnt interested in avons 
international business due to concerns about the risk of currency 
fluctuations 
avon has learned that mary kay started buying avon shares last 
nov 10 but stopped short the threshold that would have triggered 
federal ownerhip disclosure requirements cox said 
no one at mary kay was available to comment on avons portrayal 
of the events a public relations representative said 
rochon publicly conveyed his companys feelings about avon in a 
letter to preston last week that was released by mary kay no terms 
of proposed merger have been mentioned by rochon 
earlier this month avons board rejected an offer by amway 
corp to buy avon for 39 a share or about 21 billion amway 
later withdrew the offer 
in composite new york stock exchange trading tuesday avon 
closed at 3562 a share down 112

china is moving to solve a major trade dispute 
with the united states by agreeing to provide legal protection from 
piracy of imported computer programs us industry and government 
officials say 
a chinese delegation last week signed a bilateral agreement with 
us trade representative carla a hills to cover computer software 
by law and indicated that by the end of this year the beijing 
government would submit a copyright law for legislative approval 
the us computer and business equipment manufacturers association 
announced tuesday 
the industry views this agreement with the chinese as a 
landmark in uschinese intellectual property rights negotiations 
but we are keenly aware that progress is still merely in the 
conceptual stage said oliver r smoot the associations 
executive vice president 
only last february a cbema statement asserted that piracy of 
computer programs is rampant in china 
industry officials said the agreement was concluded in 
washington last thursday hours later mrs hills mentioned recent 
significant agreements with china taiwan and colombia on 
copyright and patent protection issues but still named china and 
seven other countries to a priority watch list on copyright and 
patent protection it calls for intensified negotiations and review 
by nov 1 of their antipiracy safeguards 
mrs hills office did not immediately comment on the industry 
statements a state department official insisting on anonymity 
described the uschina accord as a memorandum of understanding 
which is less binding than a formal agreement 
computer association officials said they understood the thursday 
agreement staved off harsher treatment for the china in the us 
governments first application last week of the new 1988 omnibus 
trade act three countries japan brazil and india were 
designated for negotiations and potential punitive tariffs for 
alleged unfair trade barriers 
the chinese embassy quoted a foreign trade ministry official as 
saying in a recent speech in northeast china that administrative 
and legislative measures can be taken to protect the interest of 
the intellectual property rights holders 
draft regulations on computer softwear protection should be 
ready by the end of 1989 and chinas 1989 legislative program 
provides for submission to the peoples congress of a draft 
revision of the patent law the official liu xiangeong was quoted 
as saying 
liu also mentioned the traditional chinese position that 
intellectual property such as computer software could be protected 
with buyerseller contract terms providing for confidentiality the 
us side has complained this fails to prevent copying and piracy 
by outside parties 
differences over customs and patent protection have kept china 
and the united states from making the customary fiveyear renewal 
of their science and technology agreement instead they extended 
it for only nine months last january

in an unusual move the vice chairman of 
the equal employment opportunity commission has charged two us 
subsidiaries of japans recruit co with blatant employment 
discrimination based on race sex age and national origin 
commissioners rarely bring charges themselves but eeoc vice 
chairman e gaull silberman said she believed that 
interplacetransworld recruit and recruit usa are continuing to 
violate antidiscrimination laws 
in addition a judge for the us district court in northern 
california issued a temporary restraining order tuesday prohibiting 
the company from destroying altering or removing from the country 
any documents relating to an eeoc investigation 
recruit co was at the center of japans bribery scandal that 
led to the recent resignation of prime minister noboru takeshita 
with headquarters in los angeles interplace is an employment 
agency with nine offices in cities that include new york san 
francisco and san mateo recruit usa shares a headquarters office 
with interplace and publishes helpwanted magazines in the united 
states to advertise job openings in japan 
richard kelley a senior vice president with interplace said 
his company and recruit usa would have no comment until their 
lawyers had a chance to examine the charges 
court documents include an interplace memo that describes a code 
the company allegedly used on job orders to indicate when a client 
wanted an employee of a particular age sex or race 
as detailed in the memo talk to maria meant the client 
preferred hispanics mary meant caucasians mariko meant 
japanese adam meant men eve meant females and 
maryanne meant blacks suite 20 to 30 meant age 20 to 30 
last year after a former employee threatened to expose the 
practice interplace executive vice president hideyo harada told 
employees in los angeles that she had just been instructed from 
the top to erase codes from all job orders in the computer 
database said linda krieger a senior trial attorney with the 
eeoc in san francisco 
we can prove interplace was violating title vii of the civil 
rights act from the job orders we have she said 
most charges are filed by aggrieved parties rather than 
commissioners themselves but when employment agencies 
discriminate rejected applicants usually do not know they have 
been harmed

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge shot up 08 percent in april as it reversed course after 
posting declines in the previous two months the commerce 
department said today 
the upward turn in the index of leading economic indicators 
allowed the index to steer clear of the traditional signal of a 
forthcoming recession three declines in a row 
the index designed to foretell economic activity six to nine 
months into the future had dropped a revised 06 percent in march 
and 03 percent in february 
analysts said aprils upturn which had been widely anticipated 
was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing 
there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetime 
expansion through its seventh year 
it wasnt a good bet it isnt a good bet and its not going 
to be a good bet in the fall that a recession is about to occur 
economist james annable of first national bank of chicago said in 
anticipation of todays report 
last months increase in the index was the biggest rise since a 
similar 08 percent jump in january 
using the threemonth rule of thumb for predicting recessions 
the index has correctly forecast all eight economic downturns that 
have occured since 1948 but it also has flashed false recession 
signals on five other occasions 
most recently the index declined five times in a row in the 
months surrounding the october 1987 stock market crash from which 
the economy emerged unscathed 
in april eight of the 11 forwardlooking business statistics 
that make up the composite index pointed upward led by an increase 
in manufacturers orders for consumer goods 
other indicators making positive contributions were rising 
building permits a longer average work week higher stock prices 
a decrease in initial claims for jobless benefits slower vendor 
deliveries signaling stronger demand a gain in orders for new 
plants and equipment and an increase in manufacturers unfilled 
orders 
three indicators pointed downward a drop in an index measuring 
consumer confidence a contraction in the money supply and falling 
prices for sensitive materials indicating slower demand 
the various changes left the index at 1457 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index has advanced 13 percent over the past six 
months compared with a 17 percent increase over the previous 
sixmonth period 
annable said recent reports on the economys performance 
indicate that growth will slow to a more sustainable level and 
suggest this economy is in better shape for growth than even we 
optimists thought 
pessimists too are rethinking their views 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago has been forecasting a mild recession by years end but 
now concedes the odds are by no means convincing even to me 
the evidence is coming in the side of a soft landing 
continued but subdued growth dederick said 
that is just what the federal reserve has been trying to 
produce in march 1988 the central bank began pushing up interest 
rates in an effort to slow growth just enough to restrain inflation 
without toppling the country into a recession 
dederick said an upturn in the index doesnt mean that we 
should be looking for the economy to go roaring off but it does 
weaken the case that the slowdown is going to develop into 
recession proportions 
the government reported last week that the economy expanded at a 
moderate 43 percent annual rate during the first three months of 
the year but the growth in the gross national product was a 
lackluster 18 percent when a statistical bounceback from last 
years drought is removed 
that compares with gnp growth of 39 percent for all of 1988 
still commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the latest gnp 
report indicates that fed policy over the past year appears to be 
succeeding in steering the economy to a more moderate but 
sustainable growth path 
irwin kellner chief economist for manufacturers hanover trust 
co in new york said that even with an upturn in the leading index 
the economy is still pretty weak 
a rebound in the index doesnt take away from the notion that 
the economy is slowing down but it does not imply a recession any 
time soon kellner said in advance of todays report

chief executive of toymaking giant hasbro inc has been 
hospitalized in new york city with pneumonia and is in intensive 
care the company announced 
the company issued a brief statement tuesday announcing 
hassenfelds illness but did not provide details the providence 
journalbulletin said a spokeswoman at columbia presbyeterian 
hospital in new york confirmed that hassenfeld 47 was 
hospitalized there 
the spokeswoman declined to provide details at the request of 
hassenfelds family the newspaper said a hasbro spokesman said 
hassenfeld was in stable condition 
john t oneill hasbros chief financial officer said 
hassenfeld was hospitalized friday but the wall street journal 
said the executive was hospitalized wednesday following more than a 
year of speculation that he was seriously ill hassenfeld 
repeatedly has denied rumors that he is suffering from acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome or any related illness the newspaper 
said 
the speculation began after he missed 10 weeks of work beginning 
in july 1987 because of a bacterial infection of the heart lining 
hassenfeld who maintains homes in bristol ri and new york 
also was hospitalized at columbia presbyterian for that health 
problem 
hassenfeld the grandson of the companys founder is credited 
with building hasbro into one of the countrys major toy companies 
through a series of acquisitions including milton bradley co and 
introduction of consistently successful new products among 
hasbros wellknown toys are gi joe and transformers

for every 10 takeover stories i hear maybe one happens 
oneill said hassenfeld had been running a high fever and he 
finally got to the point that his doctors advised him to have a 
rest and get into the hospital the hope and the intent is that 
stephen will mend and will be back to running this company 
hassenfelds pneumonia did not appear to be linked to his 
previous heart infection oneill said 
alan hassenfeld stephen hassenfelds 40yearold brother who is 
hasbros president and chief operating officer will run the 
company in the interim oneill said 
the hassenfeld family owns 131 percent of the company stock and 
warner communicatons owns 136 percent which is held in a voting 
trust controlled by the hassenfeld brothers hasbro has the right 
of first refusal to purchase warners stock

threeweek trend that has taken soybeans for july delivery from 
about 745 a bushel to less than 715 and july corn from about 
275 a bushel to less than 265 since may 1 
the recent broad decline in prices is due to increased rainfall 
in the midwest which has reduced fears of a second consecutive 
drought year 
the weather pattern has obviously been different and that has 
been weighing on the markets and the whole thing has been going 
down said dale gustafson a grainmarket analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert inc in chicago 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 391 a bushel corn was 1

a federal judge refused to accept a guilty 
plea from pennwalt corp in the settlement of a pollution case 
because none of the top corporate officers of the chemical company 
showed up in the courtroom 
are we going to let lawyers plead guilty for them us 
district judge jack tanner said tuesday why what happens to the 
deterrence we talk about 
individuals who plead guilty to crimes are required to appear in 
court tanner said why should we treat corporations different 
than individuals he said 
prosecutor david marshall a special assistant us attorney 
replied that the law allows attorneys to plead guilty on behalf of 
corporations 
maybe thats one of the problems tanner said adding 
what message is sent to them 
marshall said the companys willingness to pay 11 million as 
part of the plea agreement would deter others 
they just throw money at it that they just pass on to the 
public tanner said 
the case involved a 1985 spill of a cancercausing agent into a 
tacoma waterway 
the companys attorney thomas kelly jr of the seattle law 
firm preston thorgrimson ellis amp holman said pennwalts board of 
directors had approved the plea agreement 
kelly said the board and pennwalts top officers took the case 
seriously 
tanner said it wasnt fair for an unknown board of directors to 
allow an attorney to plead guilty by submitting a written plea 
agreement 
marshall then asked tanner if he wanted pennwalts chief 
executive officer or another top executive to appear in court 
tanner didnt specify what officer would be appropriate but said 
he wouldnt accept some official who is going to retire in six 
months 
the charges stemmed from the spill of at least 75000 gallons of 
a chemical containing sodium dichromate into tacomas hylebos 
waterway in 1985 after the rupture of a 180000gallon storage tank 
that had been poorly maintained 
sodium dichromate is a toxic compound containing hexavalent 
chromium a cancercausing agent 
the agreement called for the company to plead guilty to five 
misdemeanor counts two counts of negligently failing to maintain 
adequate storage tanks at its tacoma plant two counts of 
discharging pollutants and one count of failing to promptly report 
the 1985 spill to the coast guard 
the company agreed to pay the 11 million 600000 of it to be 
placed in an environmental trust fund to be used by the coast guard 
to protect puget sound 
in exchange the government agreed to drop criminal charges 
against three company executives in pennsylvania 
after the hearing kelly said he expected a company officer to 
appear before tanner a new hearing is expected in the next few 
weeks

the ceremony held under a canopy in a gravelfilled mud field 
some risks have to be taken iacocca said before the shiny 
shovels turned dirt in a small box on a stage for us this is a 
big risk 
the plant which will involve a total investment of about 1 
billion will replace the aging jefferson avenue plant and will 
begin production of a new line of sportutility vehicles in january 
1992 
it will employ about 3000 people and continue a tradition of 
chrysler and its forerunners building vehicles at the site on the 
citys east side since 1907 
before the first spade of dirt was turned wednesday the 
jefferson north plant has been the focus of controversy 
there have been lingering questions of how much the city paid 
for land and equipment when it was getting the property together 
for the plant the state department of natural resources was called 
in after reports of toxic substances being found at the site 
last week a controversy arose over chryslers hiring of a 
japanese company to do some design and engineering work for the new 
plants paint shop 
were talking 20 people in the next year and a half iacocca 
said after the ceremony a couple of million dollars maybe two 
maybe three tops to do some work on a design board 
its minuscule its so small that its tough to talk about in 
the context of a billion bucks he said 
chrysler will make a sportutility vehicle codenamed zj for 
jeep and dodge dealers at the new plant 
the company is betting that the sportutility market which it 
relies upon for much of its profits will remain strong into the 
next decade chrysler and french automaker renault will begin 
producing a smaller sportutility vehicle the jj shortly 
after the zj begins rolling off the assembly line 
the zj to be offered in two models will be larger than the 
jeep cherokee now made at toledo ohio further details about the 
zj will be unavailable until closer to production the dodge 
and jeep vehicles will receive other names later 
chrysler officials have said the zj will not replace the 
cherokee which still will be made in toledo after 1992 when the 
companys fiveyear contract with the united auto workers union 
expires 
the jefferson avenue plant makes the dodge omni and plymouth 
horizon subcompacts company officials have said they were unsure 
whether those nameplates will continue after 1992 
the plant is the second assembly plant to be built within 
detroit in the last decade general motors corps hamtramck plant 
began production in 1985

american trade policies are incompatible with the 
multilateral system of trade negotiations and could seriously 
disturb the world economic outlook some of the united states main 
trading partners said wednesday 
japan named last week by the bush administration for alleged 
unfair trade practices led the assault on us trade policy 
japanese foreign minister sousuke uno who is likely to become his 
countrys prime minister this weekend said any unilateral american 
action could undermine confidence in world economic projections 
britain strongly supported the japanese position as did 
representatives of the european economic community executive west 
germany and canada also expressed concern 
the criticism of the united states was voiced as the foreign 
trade and economy ministers of the 24nation organization for 
economic cooperation and development began their annual meeting at 
the secretariats paris headquarters 
japan the only major industrialized nation cited by the united 
states was seeking agreement on language in the oecds final 
communique to be issued thursday criticizing discriminatory or 
unilateral actions contrary to international commitments 
the communique however would not name the united states 
japan brazil and india were named to the super 301 list of 
countries that the united states says have discriminatory trade 
barriers to us goods or investments 
super 301 is the name given to a section of the sweeping 1988 
us trade law passed by a congress frustrated with a trade 
deficit that totaled nearly 120 billion last year 
us commerce secretary robert mosbacher denied americans were 
backing away from the general agreement on tariffs and trade and 
said at a news conference the bush administration was strongly 
committed to a multilateral approach to trade negotiations 
he said the americans were telling their trading partners that 
the super 301 provision was complementary to the gatt process 
but judging by reaction from some european delegates the 
americans did not appear to be making much headway with their 
explanations 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said unilateral 
trading restrictions would not cure the us deficit and even the 
threat to use them endangers the multilateral trading system 
he said that despite efforts made by the us administration to 
to limit the list of countries named under super 301 anxieties 
about the legislation remained 
howe said it is vital that the united states respect the 
principles of the multilateral trading system 
two officials of the european economic community frans 
andriessen and henning christopherssen also were critical of us 
trade policy 
andriessen said the us legislation was not compatible with 
gatt and called on the ministers to adopt a firm stand regarding 
the united states no country has to the right to interpret the 
rules of trade on its own he said 
i believe the americans are sincere when they say super 301 is 
an instrument to open frontiers but it is not the right 
instrument he told reporters 
nicholas brady head of the us delegation did not not refer 
to the controversial legislation in his speech but called on japan 
and west germany to do more to reduce their trade surpluses or face 
increased protectionism 
he said the united states was moving to promote continued growth 
for the world economy in part by undertaking to reduce its budget 
deficit to 100 billion in 1990 
but many in the united states feel we are being urged to act 
in a vacuum he said us policy alone does not drive 
international economic developments and international policy 
prescriptions for current problems cannot end with us fiscal 
action 
the dispute over trade policies overshadowed other items on the 
ministers agenda such as the surge of the us dollar inflation 
rates in member countries and the environment 
brady expressed concern about the dollars recent rise against 
other major currencies saying that if it continued it could 
undermine efforts to adjust the international economy

house legislation designed to strengthen 
pesticide regulations is coming under attack from an industry 
spokesman who says the bill neglects to consider the health 
benefits of using chemicals on crops 
jay vroom executive director of the national agricultural 
chemicals association said recently his organization considers the 
food safety amendments of 1989 so inflexible as to be 
unworkable 
they apply standards for assessing how risky a pesticide is 
without considering the benefits he said 
we hope to point out that there are many benefits associated 
with an abundant supply of food that are health benefits vroom 
said he said some fungi and insects are more dangerous to human 
health than the pesticides that kill them 
he suggested for example that there might be insect parts in 
bread and worms in tomato sauce if it werent for pesticides 
but paul allen spokesman for the natural resources defense 
council said there are some pesticides that are so dangerous to 
people particularly children that nothing else need be considered 
in banning them 
he said his organization which led the public outcry against 
alar on apples helped draft the legislation introduced by rep 
henry waxman dcalif chairman of the energy and commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment 
testimony from both vrooms and allens organizations was 
presented to the subcommittee wednesday 
this is an extension of the alar debate said allen we 
think it is a pretty good bill 
from the point of view of the farmer this would clarify the 
situation and get rid of predicaments like we had with alar in 
which farmers may suspect a chemical is dangerous but because it 
is legal they go ahead and use it allen said then there is a 
public outcry and a market disaster 
the waxman bill would establish a new healthbased food safety 
standard taking into account risks to particular population 
groups like children 
it would not allow the environmental protection agency to weigh 
economic benefits of pesticide use against health hazards 
it would streamline epas procedures for revoking unsafe 
pesticides and it would give epa new authority to require that 
health and safety data be supplied by the industry with new 
penalties if the data are not supplied 
this was the second day of hearings on the bill representatives 
of the epa food and drug administration department of agriculture 
and general accounting office spoke to the subcommittee may 17

the stock market finished higher in moderate 
trading today after bobbing up and down throughout the session 
the market opened weak after tuesdays losses but quickly 
rebounded after the government reported that its chief economic 
forecasting gauge the index of leading economic indicators shot 
up 08 percent in april following declines during the previous two 
months 
analysts said aprils upturn which had been widely anticipated 
was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing the 
economy is still strong enough to power the record peacetime 
expansion through its seventh year without new fears about 
inflation 
the market lost steam by midmorning however as the dollar 
slipped from earlier levels and bonds declined following a second 
government report that showed orders to us factories rose 27 
percent in april the best showing in four months 
analysts said the report prompted speculation that the federal 
reserve might not lower interest rates as earlier suggested 
recent expectations were that the fed might lower interest rates 
to stem the rising dollar but analysts said after the factory 
orders report that such a move by the fed is unlikely given its 
concerns about inflation 
the impact was brief as the dollar continued its upward trend 
despite tuesdays discount rate hike by the japanese the dollar 
closed mixed in european and us trading bond prices firmed 
behind the dollar and stocks followed the bond market 
analysts said the stock markets ability to break tuesdays fall 
as well as todays rebound shows an underlying strength in the 
market 
the lift in the bond market and the fact that the stock market 
resisted yesterdays chance to go lower says we still have upside 
momentum said alfred e goldman vice president of ag edwards 
amp sons inc 
also helping prices late in the session was a report that the 
federal reserve has come up with a new indicator of inflationary 
pressures based on the money supply and economic growth analysts 
said the new indicator although experimental suggests that the

allegheny international inc said wednesday it 
has filed a plan of reorganization for its sunbeam corp subsidiary 
in an attempt to extract the profitable small appliance maker from 
bankruptcy court 
it is the fifth plan the company has filed since entering 
chapter 11 reorganization in february 1988 and an attorney for 
unsecured creditors who are owed 220 million gave the latest plan 
about the same chances of success and the previous four 
i dont give it much chance said robert sable of pittsburgh 
if approved by us bankruptcy judge joseph cosetti the plan 
would pay cash to settle all of the approximately 240 million in 
claims pending against the sunbeam subsidiary it would leave the 
pittsburghbased parent still in bankruptcy court to haggle with 
creditors over settling their claims 
allegheny international also said cosetti was so aggravated with 
the collapse of the fourth reorganization plan that he suspended 
the payment of most fees to attorneys and accountants involved in 
the case 
to emphasize his disappointment that no reorganization plan was 
submitted for the parent company cosetti also invited the us 
trustee to file a request that he appoint a trustee to run the 
company allegheny international said 
the judge is trying to do something to get some movement in 
the case sable said 
but because some of the attorneys are paid by banks and 
insurance companies not the debtor all it does is put pressure 
on some people not necessarily the people who can do anything 
about it sable said 
the unsecured creditors oppose the latest plan and are very 
close to finishing their own plan of reorganization he said they 
are also considering asking cosetti to appoint a trustee 
the fourth plan collapsed after investment firm donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette discovered that allegheny international was 
falling short of its earnings goals the new york investment bank 
lowered its takeover bid by 70 million to 687 million 
rreflecting its reliance on earnings estimates to raise takeover 
funds 
the sunbeam subsidiary encompasses virtually all of the parents 
consumer products businesses 
allegheny international said it is confident of raising the 
estimated 250 million needed to reorganize sunbeam it has already 
begun discussions to find a new chief executive for the subsidiary 
which would also get an independent board of directors under the 
latest plan

company was considering buying part of the stateowned mexicana 
airlines 
it is our intention to grow united airlines without equity 
participation in other airlines he told reporters we want to 
continue our close working relationship with mexicana airlines but 
only as a marketing partner not as a buyer 
mexicanas director manuel sosa de la vega was quoted in

regulations a foreign investor would be able to purchase up to 49 
percent of mexicana which he described as economically healthy 
wolf called the liberalization of foreign investment as a a 
very progressive step and said that in the case of united 
airlines it is a very positive background which will encourage us

usx corp chairman david m roderick retired 
wednesday after a 10year term in which he made usx more of an oil 
company than a steel company 
roderick 65 a native of pittsburghs roughandtumble north 
side and a marine corps veteran rose through the companys finance 
department 
in 1979 roderick succeeded edgar b speer a steel operator who 
as chairman it was said was not above questioning a blast furnace 
foreman on the telephone if his units production fell behind 
schedule 
roderick is succeeded by president charles a corry who 
presided over the companys diversified group which produced 6 
billion by selling assets in transportation real estate and other 
businesses 
speer roderick and now corry reflect the companys 
transformation from an oversized musclebound steelmaker then 
called us steel corp to a diversified energy and steel 
corporation known today as usx 
one of rodericks first moves as chairman was to scrap plans to 
build a planned mammoth steel plant on the shore of lake erie at 
conneaut ohio 
usx officials sighed with relief that the company did not have 
to carry the additional debt and production capacity into the 
industry debacle that followed in the 1980s 
usx under roderick wrote off 3 billion in assets mostly in 
steel and closed 140 steel facilities companywide employment 
plunged from nearly 172000 in 1979 to fewer than 59000 in 1988 a 
loss of around 113000 jobs most of them in steel 
he has often said his most difficult task as chairman was to 
preside over the steel shutdowns because of the pain they caused in 
mill towns including the nearby monongahela valley where he was 
raised 
in the meantime usx spent 10 billion to acquire marathon oil 
co and texas oil amp gas corp whose 99 billion in sales in 1988 
accounted for nearly twothirds of the companys 169 billion in 
sales steel contributed 58 billion or about a third

when jartran inc ran ads touting its rental 
trucks it put uhauls competing trucks in the background so they 
looked small but the ploy backfired a court ruled the ads were 
deliberately false and ordered them halted 
jartran is one of dozens of companies that have learned the hard 
way that mentioning a competitors product in an advertisement a 
hardnosed tactic that has become common since 1985 is 
increasingly risky 
every competitive advertiser should be ready to go to court 
marketing experts bruce buchanan and doron goldman warned in the 
mayjune issue of harvard business review once your competitor 
files suit you can do little to stop the process 
congress may have accelerated the lawsuits last year by 
strengthening the fair advertising laws in addition companies 
suffering real or imagined slights by competitors have grown testy 
and are now quick to shoot back both in counterads and lawsuits 
even if they lose in court they figure they may dissuade 
someone else from trying the same thing 
under the trademark law revision act of 1988 anyone who 
misrepresents his or her or another persons goods or services 
is liable for damages 
that wording closed a loophole in the 43yearold lanham act 
which prohibited false claims about ones own products but did not 
mention another persons 
buchanan and goldman who are researchers at new york 
universitys stern school of business say it is too early to tell 
whether the tougher law will lead to a rash of lawsuits 
but they maintain there was no shortage of such actions under 
the old law they counted more than 60 judicial decisions in 
comparative advertising cases including 30 since the trend picked 
up four years ago 
even that number is conservative they say because many more 
cases undoubtedly were settled out of court or did not result in a 
judicial opinion 
in some cases companies have found to their chagrin they do 
not even have to name a competiting product to get sued 
when a tropicana orange juice ad showed olympic decathlon winner 
bruce jenner squeezing oranges into a carton the message was that 
tropicana unlike other brands was not made from concentrate 
but a competitor complained and a court ruled that the ad was 
false because tropicana juice is not in fact squeezed directly 
from oranges into the carton it is pasteurized and sometimes 
frozen first 
even claims with more than a shred of truth behind them have 
been challenged successfully 
rj reynolds for example got in trouble when it said its now 
cigarettes had the lowest tar of all brands on the market with 
only 2 milligrams of tar apiece 
that was true at least for comparable kingsize brands but 
carlton 70 a shorter brand had only 1 milligram its maker 
american brands went to court and won 
in many cases a successful suit merely leads to an injunction 
banning the offending ads from the airwaves or print media but if 
the plaintiff can show harm the claims can be expensive uhaul 
international inc for example was able to prove that it lost 
sales and faced higher advertising costs and it was awarded 20 
million in compensatory damages and another 20 million in punitive 
damages from jartran 
still advertising agencies say the tactic is more popular than 
ever with manufacturers of pain relievers pickup trucks and soft 
drinks constantly going headtohead 
you have to be very very sure of your claims said mary 
mcelyea a spokeswoman for chevrolet trucks which has been 
pounding ford in comparative ads since late 1987 
but if youre careful it can be very effective the name of 
the game is cut through the clutter and make it clear to the 
customer why your product is better

the dollar slumped wednesday amid speculation 
about central bank maneuvering 
there were rumors that the federal reserve and possibly other 
central banks were selling dollars more discreetly than they have 
in the past 
during most of the dollars recent runup the central banks 
tried to gain extra psychological impact by allowing their market 
interventions to become public that strategy did not appear to 
work 
several times wednesday the dollar appeared to be under downward 
pressure even though dealers could not pinpoint anyone who was 
selling said jerry egan chief currency dealer for the bank of 
boston 
a sudden supply of dollars from an unknown source is very 
disconcerting to most participants egan said the central banks 
certainly havent had much success with their name in lights 
he said 
central banks have tried to rein in the dollar because a high 
dollar threatens to increase the us trade deficit by making 
americanmade goods more costly in world markets it could also 
increase inflation abroad 
speculation continued wednesday that the west german central 
bank would raise interest rates or that the us federal reserve 
would lower them however many market participants said they 
considered those steps unlikely 
adding to the choppiness were endofthemonth dealings to even 
up currency accounts and the absence of some senior dealers who

coffee futures prices sank wednesday on new yorks coffee sugar 
amp cocoa exchange amid growing pessimism about next weeks special 
meeting of the international coffee organization 
on other markets precious metals slid lower grains and 
soybeans were mostly lower energy futures were mixed cattle 
futures were mixed and pork futures advanced 
coffee settled 2 cents to 408 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 13068 a pound 
the selloff was prompted by a report that john rosenbaum the 
us chief delegate to the international coffee organization 
remained determined not to attend the talks in london unless coffee 
producers first offer a proposal acceptable to the united states 
the fiveday meeting of most of the worlds largest 
coffeeproducing and coffeeconsuming nations is aimed at producing 
a new international coffee agreement to replace the sixyear pact 
that expires on sept 30 
the united states the organizations largest consumer member 
is resisting a push to simply extend the existing agreement 
calling instead for tighter restrictions on sales of coffee at 
discount prices to countries that are not members of the 
international coffee organization 
wednesdays sharp decline in prices suggests an abrupt change of 
attitude among traders who had grown optimistic about a new 
agreement following a meeting last week in florida between 
rosenbaum and coffeeproducer representatives from brazil colombia 
and central america 
id say the odds for an agreement are 5050 and its unlikely 
that anything will be hammered out until it comes down to the wire 
in september said sandra kaul a market analyst in new york with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
analyst arthur stevenson of prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york said the selling was also a reflection of the mild weather 
in brazil the worlds largest coffee producer at the beginning of 
the south american winter season 
the market will be increasingly trading off the weather in 
brazil stevenson said 
silver fell to a 33month low and gold prices also slipped on 
new yorks commodity exchange despite some weakening of the 
dollars value against other major currencies 
the decline indicated a continuing lack of investor interest in 
precious metals as an inflation hedge 
gold settled 240 to 320 lower with june at 36330 a troy 
ounce silver was 7 cents to 77 cents lower with june at 516 a 
troy ounce the lowest spot silver price since aug 29 1986

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge jumped 08 percent in april the commerce department reported 
wednesday easing fears that the nation might be about to tumble 
into a recession 
the increase in the index of leading economic indicators 
followed declines of 03 percent in february and 06 percent in 
march three monthly declines in a row has been a traditional 
signal of a possible recession on the horizon 
we believe there will be a slowdown that is gradually 
occurring in the economy but its not going to ultimately end in a 
recession said ecnomist john hagens of the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa it was a bit too premature to call for a recession 
later this year based on the data in february and march 
still analysts were not suggesting the strong numbers for april 
meant a robust economy this summer 
bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
said the report suggests that while there was a bit of a rebound 
in april from march the general story about the economy is that it 
is slowing down and slowing dramatically 
while a threemonth drop in the index has preceded all eight 
recessions since 1948 there also have been five similar series of 
declines including the five consecutive months surrounding the 
stock market crash in october 1987 that were not followed by 
recessions 
in another report showing the economy was still expanding the 
commerce department said factory orders rose a strong 27 percent 
in april to 2394 billion that followed a 07 percent increase in 
march after declines of 12 percent and 20 percent in january and 
february 
the index of leading indicators is designed to foretell economic 
activity six to nine months in the future 
robert brusca an economist with nikko securities co 
international inc in new york said recent reports show the 
economy is confused somewhere between boom and bust 
but he noted that over the past six months theres been some 
pretty steady decelerating in the growth of the index 
commerce reported that the leading indicators rose 13 percent 
over the past six months compared with 17 percent in the previous 
halfyear 
the april report showed that eight of the eleven indicators in 
the index rose led by increased manufacturers orders for consumer 
goods increased building permits and a longer average workweek 
other pluses were higher stock prices lower initial claims for 
jobless benefits slower vendor deliveries meaning growing demand 
more orders for plants and equipment and an increase in 
manufacturers unfilled orders 
on the minus side were the third consecutive drop in an index 
measuring consumer confidence a drop in the money supply and lower 
prices for sensitive materials indicating slower demand 
hagens said he was watching closely the consumer confidence 
index 
that has been a fairly good leading indicator on its own of a 
recession he said it hasnt dropped nearly enough to indicate 
that a recession is coming but if it dropped dramatically over the 
next three or four months we would be concerned 
instead hagens concludes that the enconomy is in a slowing 
mode heading for a soft landing with growth over the next year 
of 15 percent growth in the gross national product for the first 
three months of 1989 with the statistical bounceback from last 
years drought removed was 18 percent 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago also sees a soft landing continued but subdued 
growth 
a soft landing rather than a recession is what the federal 
reserve hopes to achieve in its effort to contain inflation by 
tightening credit 
william k macreynolds us chamber of commerce forecasting 
director said he believes it would be a mistake to interpret 
aprils uptick as an indication that the economy is in good 
shape 
persistent declines in the money supply are a harbinger of 
a more dramatic slowdown than most analysts expect he said 
historically a falling money supply has led to a large decline 
in overall economic growth 
the drop in the money supply in april was the fourth in a row 
the april index of leading economic indicators stood at 1457 
percent of its 1982 base of 100

the equitable of iowa cos is looking 
for a buyer for its younkers department store chain saying 
wednesday it would use the proceeds to expand its insurance 
business 
equitable said it would begin soliciting bids in the next three 
weeks and has retained the new york investment firm of salomon 
brothers inc to advise the company on offers for the chain that 
has stores in iowa nebraska illinois minnesota and south dakota 
and had sales last year of 313 million 
a sale is not expected to occur until early fall 
i think its a wise move said analyst vita marino at 
firemark insurance research a consulting and investment banking 
firm at parsippany nj many companies in the industry who 
diversified in the last decade are now streamlining their 
operations 
investors appeared to cheer the news in overthecounter 
trading equitable of iowa stock rose 150 a share to 2975 in 
wednesdays session 
analyst jeff hopson at the st louis investment firm ag 
edwards amp sons inc estimated a minimum value of 20 a share for 
younkers or 140 million 
the company has refused to speculate on what a sale would bring 
or who would buy its retail business but has valued younkers at a 
minimum of 73 million 
hopson said a logical suitor might be dillard department stores 
inc of little rock ark but that he expected several other 
companies also would be interested a call seeking comment from 
dillards was not returned 
asked about the possibility of a management buyout tom gould 
the president of younkers said managers have decided to keep their 
options open 
its better to wait and see what the opportunities are he 
said 
gould said younkers has outperformed the industry in recent 
years but it would take tremendous amounts of capital to continue 
the performance 
younkers earned 83 million on 313 million in sales last year 
and has been improving steadily in recent years in 1984 for 
example it earned 680000 on sales of 1886 million 
equitable of iowa which purchased younkers in 1979 had 
earnings of 367 million on 5097 million in revenue last year 
just two years ago it acquired the elevenstore brandeis chain for 
younkers at a cost of 60 million 
in its announcement in des moines where it is based equitable 
said the decision to seek a buyer for younkers reflects an attempt 
to redirect its capital from its retail interests to its insurance 
business 
at present we see significant growth potential in both 
businesses but unfortunately this growth would require more 
capital than is currently available said fred hubbell the chief 
executive of equitable of iowa 
the company said it would difficult and risky to attempt to 
provide enough money to expand both businesses at the same time 
our core life insurance business and in particular our 
annuities business offers great future promise hubbell said 
we have greater management experience and expertise in insurance 
as a result we believe it is appropriate at this time to seek a 
buyer for younkers

department that showed orders to us factories rose 27 percent in 
april the best showing in four months 
that report indicated the economy is still going strong

hold on interest rates 
the impact was brief though as fear of fed tightening faded 
and the dollar recovered from earlier sluggishness lifting bond 
prices and inciting some lateafternoon buying on wall street 
the main factor was the bond market because of the dollar and 
growing confidence that the economy is slowing down and that 
interest rates are going to come down said alfred e goldman

philip morris cos is testmarketing a new 
virtually nicotinefree cigarette that the company believes has as 
much flavor as regular cigarettes 
published reports said philip morris was testing the cigarette 
but the company refused to confirm or deny the reports wednesday 
saying it does not comment on product testing 
however a source who asked not to be identified said the 
reports were correct 
the lower nicotine levels in the new cigarette which will be 
sold under the names merit free and next from merit are achieved 
through a process similar to the decaffeination of coffee 
the cigarettes competitors which include american brands 
incs carlton and rjr nabisco incs now use a different 
technology that affects the taste of the tobacco 
the new cigarette will contain 01 milligram of nicotine the 
same amount as in carlton and now 
lownicotine cigarettes appeal to smokers who are trying to cut 
down their intake of harmful substances contained in tobacco smoke 
the prospect of a new potentially successful product apparently 
appealed to investors wednesday philip morris stock rose 112 a

if tyson foods inc is so eager to buy the 
holly farms corp it should simply raise its 11 billion offer a 
lawyer for a competing bidder told a chancery court judge wednesday 
in delaware 
why doesnt tyson open its pocketbook said franklin 
balotti a lawyer representing conagra inc of omaha neb 
balottis comment came at a hearing before vice chancellor 
maurice hartnett in wilmington del on a request from tyson to 
block a proposed merger announced may 20 between conagra and holly 
farms 
after listening to arguments from lawyers representing holly 
farms tyson conagra and holly farms shareholders hartnett 
retired to consider tysons motion he did not say when he would 
rule but balotti said it could take up to two weeks 
tyson has offered 11 billion in cash for holly farms stock 
while tyson would acquire holly farms in a stock swap valued at 
about 13 billion 
tyson lawyer rodman ward said holly farms managers have 
improperly favored conagra throughout a buyout squabble that began 
last year 
this battle has been bruising and expensive ward said 
balotti said conagra and holly have a legitimate agreement 
calling for a shareholder vote on the merger and bruce mcnew a 
lawyer for holly shareholders asked hartnett to allow that voting 
tyson based in springdale ark can top conagras offer if it 
wants holly shareholders to reject the merger mcnew said 
tyson doesnt want to compete he said 
a shareholders vote on the proposed merger is expected in july 
the merger to be accomplished through a stock swap would be 
worth 7481 a share or 13 billion to holly shareholders based on 
the value of conagra shares at the time the agreement was announced 
lawyers told hartnett however that the deal likely would be 
worth about 68 a share based on the longterm expected value of 
conagra stock 
tyson has issued a cash tender offer for 6350 a share or 11 
billion for all of holly farms stock 
tyson the nations largest poultry processor has been trying 
to take over holly farms since last october and the battle has 
been tied up in hartnetts court since holly and conagra announced 
a previous merger proposal last november 
holly shareholders rejected that proposal in april but an 
asset option agreement included in the plan still is at issue 
in the continuing debate 
the asset agreement allows conagra to purchase about a third of 
holly farms if the company is bought by someone else 
tysons challenge of the asset agreement is expected to go to 
trial but no trial date has been set 
observers of the holly farms battle say the memphis company 
likely would function as an independent subsidiary with conagra 
while the same would not be true with tyson 
holly farms is a diversified company heavily dependent on fresh 
fryer sales conagra specializes in agricultural services and food 
although conagra is considered a friendly suitor for holly 
farms holly lawyer kenneth nachbar said tyson and conagra were 
dealing behind the scenes until shortly before the proposed merger 
was announced 
tyson offered to pay conagra 50 million to step aside but an 
agreement based on that offer fell apart at the last minute 
nachbar said

singer co chairman paul a bilzerian resumed 
testifying at his federal securities fraud trial wednesday but 
only after his lawyers revamped their case to compensate for an 
unfavorable ruling by the judge 
on tuesday us district robert j ward ruled that if bilzerian 
testified that he didnt believe he was breaking the law in two 
takeover attempts it would open up a line of questioning to 
prosecutors about what his lawyers told him at the time 
such lawyerclient conversations are usually confidential under 
the socalled attorneyclient privilege 
when ward ruled that privilege would be waived if bilzerian was 
asked and answered certain questions by his defense lawyers they 
asked for an adjornment to reconsider their strategy 
we have determined an your honor defense attorney arthur 
mathews told ward at the beginning of wednesdays session that we 
do not intend to pursue anything upon the direct examination of mr 
bilzerian that would waive the attorneyclient privilege 
mathews added later we have restructured our planned 
examination of mr bilzerian 
under mathews questioning bilzerian described his acquisition 
of stock in hh robertson co manufacturing and construction 
concern and apparelmaker cluett peabody amp co two transactions 
listed in the indictmet against him 
his testimony was to continue thursday 
bilzerian 38 of tampa fla is accused of conspiracy 
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in 
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986 
none of the charges involve bilzerians 106 billion takeover 
of singer last year 
in two of those four transactions the 1985 purchase of cluett 
peabody amp co shares and the 1986 purchase of hammermill paper co 
stock the government contends bilzerian falsely claimed to be 
using millions of dollars of his own money when most of the money 
actually was raised by others 
but the defense has contended bilzerian acted in good faith 
and did not believe he was breaking the law in filing misleading 
documents with the securities and exchange commission 
in statements he made to the sec in 1988 bilzerian said he was 
merely following his thenlawyers advice when he supplied 
misleading information on sec forms 
ward however said by taking the witness stand and invoking 
that good faith defense under questioning by his own lawyers 
bilzerian was waiving the attorneyclient privilege and prosecutors 
could ask on cross examination what was the basis for his belief 
that he was not breaking any laws more specifically what had 
his lawyers told him at the time 
bilzerian was not required to testify 
if convicted bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in 
jail and a 250000 fine on each count

the federal communications is recommending to 
congress that it abolish a 13yearold copyright system that allows 
cable television operators to pay a percentage of their income to 
retransmit overtheair tv programs officials said wednesday 
the commission in a ruling it made tuesday and released 
wednesday said cable tv companies should negotiate with 
broadcasters and producers on a casebycase basis for programs 
critics of that approach say it would be very costly for cable 
operators to negotiate for every program individually and could 
result in fewer programs being made available to cable subscribers 
or cause subscription costs to go up 
congress in 1976 compelled broadcasters and program owners to 
allow cable operators to retransmit their programs in return for 
this compulsory license cable companies were required to pay a 
specified percentage of their revenues to the us copyright 
office the offices copyright royalty tribunal decides how to 
allocate the fees among broadcasters program owners and entities 
such as sports franchises 
in establishing the rules congress reasoned that the costs of 
working out contracts for every program would stymy the infant 
cable tv industry 
the cable industry last year paid 188 million in compulsory 
license fees according to lynn mcreynolds a spokeswoman for the 
national cable television association 
fcc chairman dennis patrick said the current system impedes 
the efficient functioning of the market and weakens the 
incentives of producers to respond to consumers tastes and 
programming preferences 
he said it also subsidizes program acquisition by cable 
operators and disadvantages competitive alternatives to cable 
but james mooney president of the cable association said the 
fcc seems to be a little off the deep end 
mooney noted that congress last year extended the present 
copyright system to companies that package tv programs for delivery 
to backyard satellite dish owners rather than making those 
packagers negotiate for shows one at a time 
congress and the commission seem not to share the same view on 
these matters mooney said in a statement 
the commission last year made a preliminary decision to 
recommend repeal of the compulsory license rules for programs that 
come from stations located outside local viewing areas 
superstations such as wtbs in atlanta and wgn in chicago are 
examples of these socalled distant signals 
cable operators use satellites or microwave systems to relay 
these signals around the nation and then pipe them into homes 
locally 
in its new decision the fcc recommended that the rules be 
repealed for all signals both from distant broadcasters and from 
local broadcasters such as channels 4 7 9 and so on 
commissioner patricia dennis concurred with patrick in the 
ruling commissioner james quello concurred with repealing the 
distant signal provision but he argued for keeping the compulsory 
license for local signals 
it is conceivable that under full copyright liability cable 
operators may choose not to carry local broadcast signals due to 
the costs of obtaining rights to retransmit the programs quello 
said 
he said the fcc should instead recommend that congress 
reimpose rules requiring cable systems to carry all local broadcast 
stations he said these mustcarry rules shouldnt exist 
without compulsory license for local signals 
he also disputed the agency staffs contention that costs of 
negotiating contracts were lower today per subscriber than in 
1976 
mooney said it was surprising the commission was 
recommending repeal of the rules for local signals 
he said that would create a situation in which cable could not 
even retransmit local signals by joint agreement the original 
rights owners in hollywood would have to consent too presumably 
for a price

president carlos salinas de gortari on 
wednesday unveiled an ambitious plan to transform mexicos 
stagnant debtburdened economy into a robust modern engine 
generating a steady 6 percent growth a year 
the national development plan for 19891994 proposes the 
modernization of the nation in all its aspects during salinas 
sixyear term of office 
the salinas administrations 164page blueprint touches on 
everything from drinking water to foreign policy but the 
centerpiece is economics 
the economic strategy of the plan has two priority goals 
achieving a growth rate of around 6 percent a year and 
maintaining stability so price increases are comparable to those of 
our commercial partners salinas said in a ceremony at the 
national palace unveiling the plan 
salinas prescription for economic health includes cutting debt 
payments keeping inflation down and prices stable encouraging 
productivity savings and investment and modernizing finance 
technology and industry 
one of the most critical elements is renegotiating the 1074 
billion foreign debt the secondlargest in the developing world 
after brazils mexico paid 9 billion in interest and 5 billion 
in principal in 1988 and servicing costs were expected to reach 16 
billion this year 
but salinas warned against blaming the debt for all of mexicos 
problems it will take more than stemming the financial hemorrhage 
he said to transform the nation 
lets not fall into thinking that once this obstacle has been 
overcome we will have resolved all our problems he warned 
the internal effort to produce and produce better is 
irreplaceable 
the plan which the constitution requires every president to 
present during his first six months in office reiterates salinas 
election campaign and inaugural address promises of economic 
recovery in a more democratic mexico with a higher standard of 
living 
salinas was able to point to substantial progress since his dec 
1 inauguration mexico has liberalized its rules on foreign 
investment won concessions and credits from international 
creditors kept the lid on inflation eased its dependence on oil 
and sold off some stateowned industries 
on tuesday the treasury department announced an agreement with 
the club of paris a group of 16 creditor nations designed to cut 
the debt by 26 billion and refinance 80 percent of the interest 
over the next decade 
last week the international monetary fund said it had approved 
a 41 billion credit line to mexico 40 percent of which can be 
used to pay off the foreign debt 
the 41yearold president stressed the importance of creating 
jobs and fostering a work force that compete in world markets in 
both productivity and quality 
he said mexico must keep pace with a changing world where 
competition and technology are critical and commercial markets are 
interdependent 
the salinas reforms follow decades of protectionism that saw the 
mexican economy grow by an impressive 6 to 7 percent each year but 
also fostered inefficient industry dependent on government 
subsidies and import barriers 
they also are an antidote to the economic crisis that began in 
1982 when the oil boom crashed and mexico a heavy borrower 
suddenly went from riches to rags 
the buying power of the average worker is now half what it was 
in 1982 and the party that has ruled mexico since 1929 barely won 
the 1988 presidential election

people whove seen the teenoriented 
channel one news show are more likely to rate it favorably than 
those who merely get a verbal description of the 
advertisersupported experiment a gallup study concludes 
although majorities in the general public generally approve of 
the idea of channel one there is some level of apprehension 
said the survey by the gallup organization inc of princeton nj 
this apprehension appears to diminish once the program is 
viewed said the group which released its findings wednesday 
the survey referred to a 12minute daily news show which 
includes 2 minutes of commercials recently beamed to six high 
schools on an experimental basis in exchange for having students 
watch the show each day each school gets 50000 worth of video 
equipment free and the company profits through the advertising 
the company that created channel one whittle communications of 
knoxville is trying to decide whether to expand the project 
nationally 
some groups laud channel one as a good way to get news to teens 
and to get sorely needed equipment into the schools 
others say that its a bad idea to have the captive malleable 
audience of teenagers watching commercials each day in a public 
school room and that educators could use the 12 minutes for other 
things 
chairman chris whittle said his company two months ago arranged 
for the gallup attitude poll because it expected various school 
boards and superintendents would request such information although 
so far they have not contacted the company for it 
for its study gallup interviewed 1046 shoppers in malls in 
colorado indiana louisiana iowa connecticut south carolina and 
new york state after showing them a videotape of a channel one 
show including commercials 
those responses were compared with another group 1007 people 
18 and over who were telephoned randomly across the country and 
given only a general verbal description of the show 
the verbal description consisted of its basic offering news and 
features timetable equipment involved and the requirement of 
daily watching it also mentioned that there were commercials and 
that the equipment was free 
of the telephoned group 57 percent said they thought channel 
one is an excellent or good idea while 34 percent said its a fair 
or poor idea 
of the shopping mall group 85 percent of the 528 teenagers 
said theyd be interested in seeing channel one in their local high 
school eightyseven percent of the 254 parents polled said the 
same eightyeight percent of the 264 nonparent adults said theyd 
like to see channel one in their local schools 
in addition more than 80 percent of teenagers and nonparent 
adults who saw the videotape said showing commercials with the news 
program was acceptable seventyfour percent of the parents who saw 
the tape said the same 
whittle said he was optimistic about the possibility of 
expanding the project to all schools which want it but wont make 
a decision until hes finished mulling over other test results 
the other tests include a survey of about 500 teachers another 
on the views of 10000 students who participated in the pilot 
showings marketing tests and a test designed to show whether 
students who watched channel one retained the information it 
contained

eastern airlines said wednesday it will expand from 
79 daily flights in june to 221 in july the companys largest 
increase in service since a strike began march 4 
eastern said it will serve 27 cities in june and 52 in july as 
it moves toward a new full schedule of 600 flights by the end of 
the year

eastern as a competitive dependable fullservice airline said 
george brennan vice president for marketing 
striking unions scoffed at easterns announcement hank weber a 
spokesman for the pilots union said the company wont have enough 
pilots in july to make 221 flights daily 
its all flap and no throttle weber said unless they 
actually do it its just talk 
weber said eastern has been flying 92 to 112 flights daily since 
the beginning of the strike the company has fewer than 250 pilots 
he said 
wally haber a spokesman for the machinists union said an 
expanded schedule would be of little help to the carrier

dependable haber said eastern is going to be flying a lot of 
empty airplanes 
miamibased eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
from its creditors march 9 five days after the start of a strike 
by machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight 
attendants 
david i shapiro the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner for 
eastern is expected to report at a hearing thursday that no viable 
offers have been made for the airline the new york times reported 
in thursdays editions 
easterns unions have recently supported proposed buyout 
proposals from two investor groups one led by former piedmont 
airlines chairman william howard and the other by chicago 
commodities trader joseph ritchie shapiro has challenged the two 
groups to put at least 100 million of their own cash at risk 
management on the other hand is proceeding with a plan to 
rebuild eastern as a smaller carrier and sell 18 billion of its 
assets separately 
eastern said the expanded schedule will allow the company to 
recall by july more than 1700 nonunion workers placed on no 
work status when the airline curtailed service shortly after the 
strike started eastern said it has 5000 employees now and 
eventually will have about 17000 compared with a prestrike total 
of around 30000 
eastern was operating 1000 flights daily before the strike and 
has 110 now sixty daily flights currently are part of easterns 
northeast shuttle business that has been sold to developer donald 
trump the shuttle business is not included in figures for flights 
planned in june and july eastern said 
in atlanta easterns largest hub the airline will launch 82 
daily flights to 26 cities by july 2 new yorkbermuda service 
begins june 9 service from miami to caracas venezuela will 
resume june 1 eastern also plans to increase flights between miami 
and new york during the summer 
the carrier said it will continue its 200 weekly flights between 
miami and 14 cities in latin america and the caribbean eastern 
said it will add about 614000 seats in july 
easterns comeback this summer will feature bargain fares 
normally associated with the introduction of new service brennan 
said in a news release 
with 39 to 139 domestic fares our customers can take 
advantage of the lowest fares in the sky without restrictive 
penalties or lengthofstay requirements 
for a limited time eastern also will offer firstclass tickets 
at prices below normal economyclass fares to attract business 
travelers

ceremsak said well need to use price as an incentive to get 
customers to try us again

atlanta to washington new york miami orlando fla tampa fla
