baiecomeau canada ap a soviet freighter whose cargo of 
toxic waste was turned away from britain dumped the load on this 
lawrence river seaport before dawn thursday and returned to sea 
the freighter nadezhda obukhova had returned the 15 steel 
containers of waste to canada but environmentalists in baiecomeau 
had won a court order early thursday banning the unloading of the 
polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs it was not clear whether the 
freighters captain was aware of the court order 
lawyer shirley kennedy said several community groups she 
represents are seeking contempt charges against the captain the 
general manager of dynamis envirotech the montreal company hired to 
dispose of the cargo and a half dozen dockworkers who unloaded the 
waste 
we dont plan any action to get the ship to return to take it 
away its up to the government to get them out of here said ms 
kennedy 
joseph storozuk vice president of the ships canadian agent 
morlines said only the public utility hydroquebec and dynamis 
envirotech are named in corriveaus order 
judge paul corriveau who issued the 10day injunction against 
unloading now will consider whether to file contempt charges 
the cargo was guarded by police deployed after some residents 
rallied wednesday to protest the waste disposal plans 
dynamis envirotch lawyer laurent trudeau suggested at a court 
hearing that corriveau order the waste be stored at its intended 
destination a hydroquebec site 
polychlorinated biphenyls were used primarily as a coolant in 
electrical transformers but have been banned in north america 
because of links to cancer 
british officials say they can be safely disposed of at very high 
temperatures canada has only one such incinerator at alberta and 
it does not handle waste from other states 
when liverpool dock owners and workers refused to unload the 
cargo quebec environment minister lise bacon announced they would 
be stored at a site 20 miles from this port 
the freighter picked up the toxic waste in montreal last month 
it had been sent by truck from nearby stbasilelegrand where it 
was left over from a warehouse fire

some statistics known about neptune as 
voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight 
diameter about 30700 miles nearly four times earths diameter 
and the fourth largest planet after jupiter saturn and uranus 
which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31760 miles 
moons two majorones triton and nereid plus at least four 
others discovered so far by voyager 2 triton fourfifths the size 
of earths moon is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit 
a planet backwards that suggests it once was a sunorbiting comet 
that hit a neptunian moon and was captured into orbit around 
neptune 
rings so far voyager has found neptune is orbited by one 
complete ring of debris and one ring arc or partial ring which 
scientists believe also may prove to be a complete ring upon closer 
inspection 
day length surface wind suggests neptune takes nearly 18 hours 
to spin on its axis but voyagers measurements indicate a day on 
neptune is closer to 16 hours the time it takes for the bulk of the 
planets interior to rotate 
year length neptune takes 165 earth years to make a single orbit 
around the sun that means a winter on neptune lasts more than 40 
earth years 
distance from sun orbits the sun at an average distance of 2793 
billion miles 30 times as far as earth and invisible to the naked 
eye from earth neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun 
but because of plutos elongated orbit it is now the ninth and 
outermost 
weather a chilly 307 degrees below zero fahrenheit at an 
altitude where the atmospheric pressure is twice that at sea level 
on earth voyager has revealed cirruslike clouds 400mph wind and 
an earthsized cyclone and other storms in neptunes atmosphere the 
source of the internal heat creating neptunes weather is a mystery 
earths comes from decaying radioactive material in rocks 
atmosphere primarily hydrogen and helium but neptune appears 
pale bluegreen because enough methane the major component of 
natural gas is present to absorb red light 
structure scientists suspect that a third of the way toward 
neptunes center the atmosphere gives way to a slurry of water and 
rock with no distinct skysea boundary 
discovery in 1846 by johann gottfried galle and heinrich louis 
darrest at the berlin observatory neptune was discovered because 
its presence was predicted based on disturbances in uranus orbit

five homicides per day is the norm in the big 
apple but it doesnt take a crackcrazed gunman to kill you here 
death can be as close as the nearest street corner 
ellen sauer had just decided to take a nap saturday evening when 
a steam pipe exploded beneath the street outside her manhattan 
apartment building killing her and two consolidated edison workers 
who had responded to what had been a routine call 
by chance that woman had been in the front of her apartment 
the new york times editorialized tuesday about mrs sauers death 
and it was chance that put those particular workmen at that 
particular site 
random death is a reality from podunk to peoria but in new york 
city where murders hit an alltime high last year where the 
infrastructure is deteriorating where highrise construction can be 
fatal the odds are a little higher 
in the past two months numerous other new yorkers found 
themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time 
an apparent leak of natural gas set off an explosion burying 
reginald boynes beneath a ton of brick in his washington heights 
home on july 15 
a stoop on a lower east side building collapsed crushing a 
10yearold girl and her 11yearold friend while they were playing 
a week earlier 
a beer bottle thrown from a 15story building struck a passing 
4yearold girl on the head on june 17 sheena fuller died five days 
later 
a 500pound concrete slab fell from the fdr drive onto a car 
driven by benjamin bernstein 49 who was going to pick up his wife 
in manhattan on june 1 he was killed instantly investigators found 
40 more flawed sections of the highway after his death 
its not limited to natives in june 1988 a north carolina man 
was killed when a ceiling at the helmsley windsor hotel caved in 
while he was lying in bed a summons was issued to owners harry and 
leona helmsley 
to this you can add the gunfire which has become one of the 
sounds of new york city last year more than 1800 people were 
killed 
according to a study by lawrence w sherman university of 
maryland professor of criminology the number of innocent bystanders 
gunned down in new york has increased each year since 1985 when 
the number was four to last years dozen 
it is very frightening and i dont see any indication that 
its turning around said thomas reppetto head of the new 
yorkbased citizens crime commission 
this year it took just three days for a bystander to get killed 
14yearold jeffrey vilain of brooklyn was returning home from a 
prayer meeting when he was killed by a 9mm slug 
last month 17yearold sean singh was enjoying a latenight 
snack at a brooklyn fastfood restaurant when he was fatally shot in 
the chest by a gunman robbing a woman outside for singhs family 
it ended a dream which began eight years ago when they arrived here 
from guyana 
we wanted to give him a better life if we had stayed at 
home even if we were eating rice and peas it would still be 
peaceful said his grandmother stella singh we would not have 
lost our child like this 
construction accidents also claim an unknown number of lives each 
year some such as an aspiring actor killed in 1987 when a beam 
fell on him while he walked down a midmanhattan street attract 
attention while others pass unnoticed among the constant 
restructuring of the city skyline 
the most famous victim of a construction accident survived 
brigitte gerney whose legs were crushed by a 35ton crane that 
tipped over on her while she walked past a midmanhattan 
construction site on may 30 1985 
her recovery during which she received a call from president 
reagan gained frontpage headlines mrs gerney 53 received a 10 
million settlement last year and has since shunned the spotlight she 
never sought 
shes relieved its over and wishes it never happened her 
attorney robert conanson said after the july 1988 agreement she 
wants to be a private productive person

the independence that many in the baltic republics 
are striving for is a rarity in their long history at the crossroads 
of some of europes mightiest armies 
napoleon hitler stalin russian czars and swedish kings have 
marched their forces across the flat land at the eastern end of the 
baltic sea 
although lithuanians latvians and estonians are among the oldest 
peoples of europe they have enjoyed relatively rare moments of 
independence and more often have been fought over by their larger 
and more powerful neighbors 
we are slaves lithuanian philosopher vitautus kazlauskas 
told an independence rally in the republics capital of vilnius on 
wednesday we have been sold so many times 
at the beginning of the century the baltic republics formed part 
of the russian empires window on the west a rich ethnic melting 
pot that included germans poles jews russians and ukrainians 
in contrast to the slavs who dominated the empire they used the 
latin alphabet and were primarily roman catholics and lutherans 
instead of orthodox christians 
their land guarded the southern approach to the czars capital of 
st petersburg at the end of the gulf of finland finland across a 
narrow gulf guarded the northern approach 
but capping a rising tide of nationalism at the end of the 19th 
century the baltics in 1918 declared their independence after the 
czars empire crumbled under the weight of war and revolution 
much of estonia latvia and lithuania watched lenins bolsheviks 
seize power in st petersburg from behind german lines as a bloody 
civil war and famine enveloped revolutionary russia the baltics 
became a vital listening post for foreign diplomats and journalists 
to whom the russian borders were closed 
while some were eager to join the ranks of the red armys 
internationalist brigades and fight for the bolsheviks in the 
bloody civil war that followed the revolution other lithuanians 
latvians and estonians started building independent countries that 
lenin recognized in a treaty signed in 1920 
those small independent lands set up parliamentary governments 
and took their place in international affairs establishing 
embassies in the united states as well as many other countries 
bu as world war ii approached they found themselves caught 
between two of the main adversaries germany and russia just as 
they had during world war i 
and josef stalin eager to regain the territories lost during the 
revolution brought lithuania latvia and estonia into the soviet 
sphere of influence in a secret agreement with hitler signed aug 
23 1939 eight days before germany attacked poland 
less than a year later soviet tanks and soldiers entered the 
region which was forcibly annexed to the soviet union stalin had 
thousands of opponents shot or exiled to siberia and carried out a 
second wave of repression after the soviet union reclaimed the 
baltics from germany at the end of the war 
for decades the soviet union insisted that the republics joined 
voluntarily and denied that there had been any secret deal with 
hitler the united states and other western countries never 
recognized the absorption of the baltic republics and almost 50 
years later the embassies of the onceindependent countries still 
function in washington 
the soviet union has done everything to remove the republics of 
estonia latvia and lithuania from the memory and the map of 
europe from your libraries and textbooks your sense of justice 
your grief and your minds baltic activists said in a declaration 
tuesday on the eve of the hitlerstalin agreement

a woman who attempted to dramatize the plight 
of the homeless by walking 790 miles to washington dc has given 
up her trek after raising only 112 in 130 miles saying she is 
disillusioned with humanity 
maria rogers johnson 31 said donations were poor because 
publicity about her hike also revealed her criminal convictions on 
charges of felony arson retail theft and fleeing and eluding 
police 
ms johnson who attributed her record to a drug and alcohol 
abuse problem said the news in turn prompted her employer to fire 
her from her job as housemother at a home for unwed pregnant women 
i came back a changed person she said i always believed 
in the goodness of people i really dont believe that anymore 
ms johnson said her attitude was reinforced by people she met 
who refused to donate to her cause display her brochure or even 
give her a place to stay overnight or feed her 
there were a lot of good people out there but at the same 
time there was a lot of meanness the bad outnumbered the good 
she said 
she said her impressions changed only slightly wednesday when she 
received a letter from an aide to president bush commending her 
heroism in wanting to spotlight the plight of the homeless through 
your own sacrifice

graduates of high schools in the the area where the 
pilgrims landed will approach prospective employers with a diploma 
and a guarantee that they know basic skills 
we will warrantee for three years after graduation the skills 
of our graduates superintendent bernard sidman said wednesday 
if any time during that threeyear period an employer reports to 
us that for example a graduate cannot make change at a cash 
register we will with no charge to anybody allow the student to 
enroll in one of our evening classes for retooling 
sidman said the guarantee effective with the 1990 high school 
graduating class was approved unanimously tuesday night by the 
plymouthcarver regional school committee 
it is the school committees response to the cry for 
accountability and also to complaints we hear all the time around 
the country about student skills in reading and arithmetic he 
said 
sidman said the school district will take an employers word 
there is an educational deficiency and offer retraining he said the 
district has a strong adult education program so it can keep its 
promise 
the twomunicipality district he said has about 2500 students 
in three high schools about 30 miles south of boston 
sidman said the area which has a heavy concentration of 
touristrelated businesses offers many yearround jobs to high 
school graduates 
the school board has been very concerned with the performance 
of their students he said they want to let the community know 
they are responsive 
the idea was based on a guarantee program offered by the wayzata 
minn school district sidman said 
david landswerk superintendent of the minnesota district said 
in a telephone interview the program has succeeded in the two years 
it has been offered and that not a single graduate has been 
referred back to the school by an employer 
lucille balombiny landswerks executive assistant said the 
wayzata program was approved by the school board in february 1987 
and took effect with that years graduating class the minnesota 
district includes eight municipalities and has about 1700 students

a professional clown wont have to pay 
through the nose for leaving on a comic disguise at a recent 
sheriffs roadblock 
although the state attorneys office refused to dismiss it as a 
laughing matter a spokesman said tuesday that nancy cherrington 
should not be prosecuted under a law that prohibits wearing a mask 
or hood in public 
she was accused of wearing a plastic nose in public and 
disobeying a deputy and faced up to 18 months in jail and up to 
1500 in fines 
the 45yearold geneva homemaker and professional clown was 
arrested during a roadblock at an apartment complex where 
authorities suspected the drug trade was growing 
cherrington had been visiting friends when she was stopped and 
because she often wears a clown nose out in public she thought she 
would try it out on orange county deputies but deputies were not 
amused when she refused to remove her nose which was attached to 
yellow sunglasses 
i feel better she said after the charges were dropped i 
was a little worried 
the law would apply to cherrington only if she had been trying to 
conceal her identity the state attorneys statement said 
traditional holiday costumes also are exempt from the law 
cherrington had planned to wear one of her many clown noses in 
court 
i pop on my nose for everybody im not prejudiced she 
said i love the reaction when i put my nose on

apply for reinstatement after one year with no guarantees his 
petition will be granted sources said 
there were reports that the cincinnati manager would be out of 
baseball for as many as five years but one source said there was no 
definite length 
giamatti announced wednesday night that he would hold a news 
conference in new york at 9 am thursday however the commissioner 
did not say officially what the news conference would be about 
rose scheduled a 10 am edt news conference thursday at 
riverfront stadium rose did not address the gambling allegations 
but spoke of his new daughter cara born tuesday tyler wanted a 
baby sister so everything is going to be good rose said 
sources familiar with the case told the associated press that the 
news conference will involve roses suspension however the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity were not sure of the 
length of the suspension 
several baseball sources said giamatti pushed for a settlement 
because he was afraid the case would continue to linger in court 
preventing him from disciplining rose 
the sources said rose needed to settle because he believed 
giamatti ultimately would suspend him once rose exhausted legal 
appeals that need increased once baseball successfully moved the 
case into federal court 
rose under investigation since feb 20 obtained a temporary 
restraining order from an ohio state court on june 25 which 
prevented giamatti from holding a hearing on the gambling 
allegations 
rose was accused by bookmakers and other acquaintances of betting 
on baseball including reds games investigators for baseball 
compiled a 225page report that alleged rose bet on the reds from 
198587 and cited evidence that included betting slips allegedly in 
roses handwriting and telephone and bank records 
a hearing on roses request for a preliminary injunction is 
scheduled to begin on monday in federal court in columbus ohio 
reds owner marge schott contacted at home wednesday night said 
she had received no word from the commissioners office about the 
news conference 
i know nothing about whats cooking she said im going to 
wait for tomorrow and see what happens

leaders of the newly merged evangelical 
lutheran church in america said they were loaded with confidence for 
the future despite some pressing financial constraints 
representatives of the 53million member denomination heard 
reports that revenues were running short for budgeted churchwide 
programs 
the shortrange picture for this church is one of painful 
adjustment and in some cases severe retrenchment presiding 
bishop herbert w chilstrom said 
nevertheless the longrange story is a good one he said 
our future is secure and bright once we get beyond these 
difficult startup years chilstrom said wednesday night at the 
opening business session of the churchs first national assembly 
formed of three previous lutheran bodies the denomination is the 
nations fourth largest protestant church after southern baptists 
united methodists and the mainly black national baptist convention 
the sober discussion of budgetary problems contrasted with a 
stirring worship service that opened the eightday meeting earlier 
wednesday 
amid prayers scripture readings and antiphonally sung hymns 
bounced back and forth between men women and a black childrens 
choir about 2000 people partook of the consecrated wine and bread 
at ohare exposition center 
a huge white panel over the podium proclaimed the theme of the 
meeting many voices one song 
chilstrom expressed hope that the initial legislative work would 
produce a sense of cohesiveness and identity and set the pattern 
for the future 
we are like a ship setting out into the deep he said if 
we set the wrong course even by a few degrees it will mean that 
future assemblies will have to make major corrections 
launched at the start of 1988 the church had a shortfall of 
158 million its first 14 months when expenditures totaled 1043 
million continuing revenue shortages forced a cut in 1989 
expenditures from 993 million to 923 million 
chilstrom said congregational support for missionaries campus 
ministry parochial schools seminaries and various urban and rural 
programs is not what it should be 
members in 1988 contributed a total of 13 billion up 46 
percent from the year before and slightly outpacing a 44 percent 
inflation rate but the 118 million channeled on to synod and 
national programs was down 
the rev lowell g almen church secretary reported the number 
of asian black and hispanic members rose by 11 percent last year 
now amounting to 18 percent of the predominantly white church the 
church has set a goal of raising minority membership to at least 10 
percent by the end of its first decade 
overall membership however sagged slightly almen said the 
back door of our congregations seems larger than our front door

with us schools projected to soak up a record 
353 billion for the new school year education secretary lauro 
cavazos and other educators disagree on whether students are 
benefiting 
our nation continues to make a tremendous financial investment 
in education but the education deficit continues to grow cavazos 
said wednesday and too many americans remain illprepared for a 
changing world 
cavazos released the departments annual statistical forecast for 
the 198990 school year showing that all levels of public and 
private education will spend about 353 billion in state federal 
and local dollars 
the education spending will amount to 68 percent of the gross 
national product and will exceed the bush administrations proposed 
1990 national defense budget of 303 billion said cavazos 
the 353 billion is 68 percent more than last years overall 
spending of 330 billion 
but education department officials point to the dismal 
performance of american youth on academic achievement tests 
particularly in areas such as math and science that are considered 
critical in a fastchanging technical society 
in most instances americans scored near the bottom in both math 
and science when compared with dozens of other industrial nations 
mary futrell outgoing president of the national education 
association attributed the increasing costs of education to a rapid 
rise in the number of children living in poverty 
as you get more children who are poor into the school systems 
you get more deficiencies and students whose needs are different 
and greater said mrs futrell explaining that the report fails 
to accurately reflect the diversity of students children of 
recent immigrants who dont speak english and those from poor or 
singleparent families 
so it costs more to educate those children she added 
ann lynch president of the national parents and teachers 
association headquartered in chicago said the huge investment in 
education shows commitment even though all the students needs are 
not being met 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
bristled at cavazos use of the term education deficit 
we have many educational problems because were suffering from 
a leadership deficit said shanker it is the leadership deficit 
thats at the bottom of the educational deficit 
president bush has called an education summit sept 2728 in 
charlottesville va with the nations governors and cavazos said 
the meeting was a historic step to address this national 
crisis 
such leadership is critical cavazos said but parents 
teachers indeed all americans must become involved if we are to 
ensure that each student has an opportunity to be educated to his or 
her fullest potential 
among the major conclusions in the report 
spending on higher education will increase the most to 141 
billion up 72 percent from the 1314 billion spent last year 
once adjusted for inflation that represents a 36 percent increase 
since the 198081 school year 
expenditures for each fulltime higher education student will 
rise to 14923 nearly 750 more per student than a year ago 
costs for public and private elementary and secondary schools 
are expected to rise to 212 billion a 66 percent increase over 
last years 1991 billion after inflation that is a 29 percent 
gain since 198081 
expenditures for each elementary and secondary school student 
are expected to reach a record high of 5246 308 per student more 
than last year 
the average salary of public elementary and secondary school 
teachers is expected to rise to 31200 up 55 percent over last 
years average of 29567 after inflation that will amount to a 20 
percent increase since 198081 
while educational costs continue to increase total enrollment in 
the nations schools and colleges will rise only slightly up by 
400000 for a total of 587 million this fall about 456 million 
young people will attend elementary and secondary schools and 131 
million students will attend higher education institutions 
petersons a princeton nj education and career information 
company said a recent survey found that 224 of the nations most 
competitive colleges experienced an average enrollment decline of 
16 percent the company said public institutions freshmen declined 
by 34 percent while independent institutions increased their 
enrollment slightly by 06 percent 
the education department projected a decrease of 178000 high 
school graduates for the spring of 1990 bringing the total to 26 
million the trend has been generally downward since the peak year 
of 1977 when nearly 32 million students received diplomas

federal officials say theyll decide soon 
whether to give in to residents of a small west texas city who 
oppose a proposal to conduct a series of highpowered underground 
explosions nearby 
officials of the defense nuclear agency met wednesday with texas 
congressional aides who said they were told a decision will be made 
within 10 days on whether to drop consideration of the buck king 
ranch 25 miles north of del rio texas as a possible site for the 
explosions 
the proposed nonnuclear explosions are intended to simulate the 
impact of nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and evaluate 
the sturdiness of us and soviet deepunderground command and 
control facilities 
residents of the arid texas city say theyre concerned the blasts 
might endanger their only source of drinking water the san felipe 
springs 
defense spokeswoman cheri abdelnour said the pentagon agency is 
awaiting the results of tests on core samples drilled at the site to 
assess the geology 
were pushing hard for a decision and we expect to have 
something in two weeks she said 
del rio officials want the agency to immediately abandon 
consideration of the buck king ranch last week mayor alfred 
gutierrez and city manager jeffrey pomeranz presented top defense 
nuclear agency officials with petitions signed by 12000 of the 
citys 40000 residents opposed to the explosions 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas whose staff met wednesday with dna 
officials said the agency has told him that data from the area is 
still being evaluated and a final determination will be made within 
a week to 10 days 
larry neal a spokesman for sen phil gramm rtexas said the 
officials indicated they were concerned about the level of 
opposition that has developed in del rio and that it will be a 
factor in their decision 
the graduated series of explosions would start with a 1000pound 
charge in 1990 increasing to 470ton charge an equivalent of 300 
tons of tnt in november 1992 
the dna said the explosions were designed to have no significant 
environmental impact and they would not affect archeological sites 
near the buck king ranch

the movie casualties of war presents a 
distorted picture of the vietnam war and is a lie about what we 
were really like in vietnam says the former chairman of the 
vietnam veterans memorial fund 
the film depicts vets as morally insensitive barely competent 
soldiers with cynical and cowardly officers john wheeler 
president of the center for the vietnam generation said wednesday 
the film maligns vietnam veterans by exploiting false 
stereotypes about american fighting men in the southeast asian 
conflict he said at a news conference every dollar spent to see 
this film is a knife in the heart of some vet his kids or others 
who love him he said 
the movie starring michael j fox and sean penn and directed by 
brian de palma is based on a true story and tells of an army squad 
that kidnaps repeatedly rapes and then murders a vietnamese girl 
by focusing on a rape de palma declines to tell the greater 
truth that in vietnam the overwhelming number of us were decent 
built orphanages roads hospitals and schools said wheeler who 
served as an officer in vietnam it is a lie about what we were 
really like in vietnam 
wheeler was joined at the news conference by marc leepson 
speaking on behalf of vietnam veterans of america 
leepson said that in recent years weve gotten movies and tv 
shows depicting the war more realistically less sensationally and 
showing vets who are not just cartoon characters and cliched 
stereotypes now thanks to brian de palma the cinematic image of 
those who fought in vietnam has taken a giant step backward 
the unspoken message of casualties of war is that the norm in 
vietnam was rape and murder and that only a brave handful of gis 
acted humanely that message is 180 degrees from the truth he 
said 
peggy siegal a new yorkbased publicist for de palma said when 
asked about the criticism we have no comment 
the publicity office of columbia pictures which distributed the 
movie declined to provide any comment on the remarks by wheeler and 
leepson 
from 1979 until this year wheeler served as chairman of the fund 
that sponsored the design and construction of the vietnam veterans 
memorial on the mall in washington 
the center for the vietnam generation based in suburban mclean 
va describes itself as a nonprofit organization that fosters 
knowledge about the 60 million americans who came of age in the 
vietnam era

a public interest coalition says brewers should 
halt glitzy malt liquor ads that target blacks and hispanics but an 
industry group says theres nothing sinister about the ad 
campaign 
we make no apologies for marketing a malt liquor or for the 
fact that this particular product is especially popular in the black 
and hispanic markets said stephen j burrows a vice president of 
st louisbased anheuserbusch which makes king cobra malt 
liquor 
industry representatives say malt liquor is advertised more 
heavily in the black and hispanic communities because it is popular 
there they also point to various reports including one from the 
federal trade commission discounting any link between alcohol 
advertising and alcohol abuse 
however the coalition of 22 health and community groups formed 
around the washingtonbased center for science in the public 
interest wants government to limit the alcohol content of malt 
liquor to 5 percent and pressure brewers into stopping ads targeted 
at the two minority groups 
as physicians who encounter all too many alcoholrelated 
problems in our offices and emergency rooms we know that malt 
liquor is a faster way to get drunk or destroy your liver said 
dr walter l faggett a district of columbia physician speaking for 
the black national medical association 
not only are malt liquor products harmful themselves but like 
wine coolers and other alcohol beverages they are gateway drugs 
that pave the way to crack cocaine heroin and polysubstance 
addiction he said 
the beer institute an industry group defended the ads 
there is nothing at all unusual or sinister about marketers 
tailoring their marketing campaigns to particular market segments 
peter bell executive director of the minneapolisbased institute 
on black chemical abuse said at a wednesday news conference that 
blacks who make up 10 percent of the us population consume 
onethird of all malt liquor 
the central question we must focus on is the fragile nature of 
the black community today bell said can we afford to have 
aggressive marketing campaigns targeted toward it theres not one 
issue on the black agenda housing health care crime education 
that is not negatively impacted by alcohol and drug abuse 
carlos molina president of the latino caucus of the american 
public health association criticized the ads for exploiting and 
perpetuating another latino stereotype super macho 
the coalition is asking treasury secretary nicholas brady to 
restrict the alcohol content of malt liquor to 5 percent 
beer generally has a 46 percent alcohol content while malt 
liquor begins at 56 percent and one brand contains 109 percent 
although most are under 7 percent 
cspi a nonprofit advocacy group that normally concerns itself 
with general health issues has been criticizing the advertising 
practices of the nations breweries saying they target young men as 
well 
the issue has been in the forefront since thensurgeon general c 
everett koop said in a may report on drunk driving that 
youthoriented advertising and other promotional practices appealing 
to youth should be restricted 
the industry through the beer institute and individual 
corporations maintains its putting money back into the community 
through contributions to education and other activities 
burrows said anheuserbusch has contributed 65 million over the 
last 10 years to the united negro college fund and the hispanic 
scholarship foundation

us efforts to extradite suspected criminals 
hiding in other countries frequently fail in large part because the 
suspects cant be found or other nations are reluctant to arrest 
them officials say 
federal officials last year requested the return of 253 citizens 
and foreigners wanted in the united states for crimes ranging from 
drug trafficking to money laundering according to the state 
department 
only 73 were forced back 
it takes time to get these people a state department 
official said wednesday also when we ask for someone to be 
arrested that doesnt mean they can always be found 
the justice department issued a mostwanted list tuesday for a 
dozen colombian men charged with drugrelated crimes in the united 
states but bringing such suspects to american soil for trial is 
rare 
in most cases the fugitives cant be found that certainly is 
the case in colombia said the state department official who 
following department rules spoke on the condition of not being 
further identified 
the situation in colombia is further complicated by the 
reluctance of judges and magistrates there to anger the nations 
powerful drug cartels which have assassinated hundreds of jurists 
and politicians who dared to oppose them 
the latest such incident occurred last week with the murder of 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan who had promised a 
government crackdown on drug traffickers 
the only notable extradition from colombia came in 1987 when 
cocaine smuggling kingpin carlos lehder was arrested in colombia and 
brought to the united states within hours lehder charged with 
conspiring to import 33 tons of cocaine into the united states was 
sentenced to life imprisonment here 
another colombian juan ramon matta was nabbed in honduras by 
us officials in 1988 and whisked out of the country to the united 
states but that action prompted violent antiamerican 
demonstrations because honduras did not have an extradition treaty 
with the united states 
matta is jailed on drug charges in connection with the 1985 
torturemurder in mexico of us drug enforcement administration 
agent enrique camarena salazar 
despite those successes the state department official said 
extradition remains a complex and expensive procedure 
the process starts with formal charges against a person who is 
overseas the case then goes to the justice department which asks 
the state department to request that the host country arrest the 
suspect 
local authorities normally must decide whether to make the arrest 
and whether to permit the person to be deported 
the state department official said there is no master list 
breaking down the types of crimes those on the us extradition list 
face in the united states 
its not like a 10mostwanted list said justice department 
spokesman joe krovisky we go after them as the requests come in 
krovisky said the justice department normally will not identify 
the people it seeks abroad saying that information is not 
released until the person is returned to the united states or the 
case is made public in the other country 
a spokeswoman for the state departments bureau of international 
narcotics matters confirmed that the united states is seeking the 
extradition of four or five people from pakistan for drugs but 
she had no other information on the cases or other countries 
pakistan is one of the worlds main suppliers of highgrade 
heroin the state department says pakistani opium production last 
year was more than 200 tons 
neither the state nor justice departments would release 
information about traffickers operating in the remote golden 
triangle the heroinrich region where burma thailand and laos 
share a border 
in some cases most notably in panama the united states has 
virtually no chance of having someone extradited to america soil 
panama and the united states dont have an extradition treaty 
gen manuel antonio noriega the de facto leader of panama was 
indicted on drug trafficking charges in florida in 1988 and leaders 
of colombian drug cartels are reported to have gone to panama during 
an earlier extradition scare in their home country in the mid1980s

cost estimates for the first five years of 
coverage for catastrophic illnesses under medicare are being 
increased from 30 billion to 45 billion by the congressional 
budget office a congressional aide says 
the estimates prompted rep harris fawell rill to write a 
dear colleague letter to all members of the house repeating his 
arguments that the program should be repealed fawell aide tracy 
king said wednesday 
fawell is vacationing in michigan and could not be reached ms 
king said the spokesman for the congressional budget office didnt 
answer his telephone wednesday night 
much of the new insurance programs financing comes from an 
income tax surtax of up to 15 percent of income tax liability over 
150 with a ceiling of 800 a year the surtax applies only to the 
richest 40 percent of older eligible americans 
the charges have prompted bitter denunciations from lobbies for 
the elderly and congress is wrestling with proposed revisions 
the higher estimates result mostly from an upward revision in the 
cost of skilled nursing home care originally estimated at 1 
billion a year an aug 7 cbo memo raised the estimate to 24 
billion a year and a later update put it at 36 billion a year 
ms king said 
she said cbo plans to publish an updated memo on costs next month 
the health care financing administration part of the department 
of health and human services estimates the cost at 44 billion a 
year 
higher estimates for drug costs account for the rest of the 
higher cbo estimate ms king said 
fawell argues that a repeal is the only way you can do 
anything the program was flawed from the start 
the house ways and means committee had approved a measure that 
would among other things cut the surtax in half to 75 percent 
keeping a ceiling of 800 the rate and the ceiling would increase 
gradually through 1993 
the committee provision also would permit medicare participants 
to opt out of catastrophic coverage as long as they also dropped 
medicare part b which covers physicians fees 
the senate has not acted on the question preferring to let the 
house take the initiative

rejecting us appeals for a tougher stance 
the organization of american states approved a statement early today 
expressing deep concern over the failure of an oas mediating team to 
promote a democratic transfer of power in panama 
the statement approved by oas foreign ministers after 12 hours of 
marathon closeddoor negotiations resolutely exhorts panamanians 
to settle their differences before sept 1 that is the date on 
which the panamanian constitution calls for the installation of a 
new president 
the united states joined the 30 other oas members in approving 
the statement at 1228 am edt even though the document did not 
demand that gen manuel antonio noriega step down as commander of 
panamas military forces 
that has been a consistent us position for 18 months but many 
other oas members believe an endorsement of that stance could set a 
dangerous precedent they see the us position as a violation of 
oas provisions barring intervention in the internal affairs of 
member countries 
during the meeting which started shortly after noon and extended 
until after midnight a number of draft statements were circulated 
among delegates assembled at the ornate oas headquarters building a 
few blocks from the state department 
but all met with resistance from both the us and panamanian 
delegates in the end the delegates approved a simple 
fiveparagraph resolution that offended no one but said little 
the plenary session had been scheduled to get under way at 3 pm 
wednesday but it wasnt gaveled to order until 1221 am today 
approval of the statement came seven minutes later 
the delegates expressed deep concern that parties to panamas 
political conflict have been unable to reach a solution and said the 
mediating team would be available for additional consultations upon 
request 
afterward panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter credited the 
four oas mediators with getting a dialogue started among panamanian 
officials and opposition leaders 
but the chief us delegate deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger said that until democracy is restored in panama each 
member of the 31nation oas has an obligation to isolate this 
outlaw regime 
he said noriegas purported alliance with cocaine traffickers is 
aggression as surely as adolf hitlers invasion of poland 50 years 
ago was aggression two florida grand juries indicted noriega last 
year on drug trafficking charges 
the panamanian crisis erupted in may when authorities threw out 
the results of a national election which according to independent 
observers had been won handily by the antinoriega candidate 
guillermo endara the oas mediation effort was approved a week after 
the election results were voided 
wednesdays meeting was the fourth time in four months that the 
foreign ministers gathered here to discuss the crisis in the 
interim the mediators made numerous trips to panama attempting to 
hammer out a solution 
in the absence of an agreement it is unclear what will happen in 
panama on sept 1 the date when an elected president is due to 
take office 
ritter told reporters wednesday night the government has a strong 
incentive to reach an agreement with the opposition before that date 
in order to satisfy the countrys constitutional requirements 
the mediating team issued a report to the ministers wednesday 
expressing optimism that a restoration of democratic rule in panama 
may be within reach 
but state department officials said there was no basis for any 
such a conclusion and a panamanian opposition leader ricardo arias 
calderon called the mediation effort a failure because noriega 
refused to negotiate in good faith 
state department officials objected not only to the positive tone 
of the report but also to its criticism of us policy toward 
panama the report called attention to the negative effect on 
the negotiations of the maneuvers carried out by the armed forces 
of the united states in panama us military personnel in panama 
numbers about 10000 
a state department official speaking privately expressed 
irritation that the report singled out the united states for 
criticism without mentioning noriega by name at any point in the 
report

its time for someone to do it again griffin said shortly

i feel its very important to do this said griffin 35 a

star of kerouacs beat novel on the road 
it could inspire someone else to realize how big this poetry 
thing is he said 
the poetry thing griffin refers to is what he and his fellow 
travelers michael brunner doug knott bobbo staron and scott 
wannberg say is a booming beat scene that has emerged in los 
angeles 
thus the five have put together the karma bums tour and are 
spreading their words in clubs in albuquerque santa fe and taos 
nm denver and boulder colo and san francisco before returning 
home for an endoftour reading in september 
once upon a time performance art was common in cities like san 
francisco and new york said wannberg whose second book the 
electric yes indeed has just been published by shelf life press 
now he said the scene has shifted to southern california which 
was once looked upon by the other big cities as a cultural abyss 
it seems to have fizzled in san francisco added wannberg a 
big bearish man who talks in the same dramatic charles 
bukowskiinfluenced tones in which he writes there is definitely 
more happening here now than many people would admit to 
readings are around town just about every night noted wannberg 
36 who has read locally for more than a dozen years 
they take place in venues that include both trendy west side 
bistros where celebrities sometimes read their works and gritty 
biker bars where the performers must vie with noisy drunks for the 
audiences attention 
much of what gets read in both places wannberg acknowledged is 
patently awful some of it however is also quite good he was 
quick to add 
but if were having a poetry renaissance i dont think its a 
renaissance thats actually recognized by most of the rest of the 
country he saidr is one small freeform effort to change that 
said griffin 
as they do in los angeles the poets reciteheir work from appear 
in clubs in one city after another often they act out their work on 
stage as well 
they say they hope the audience joins in whenever it feels the 
massive in the united states griffin said but too many peple 
turn their backs on it because cliques existither somebody at a 
reading or somebody with a masters degree telling them about 
shakespeare 
or as knrnedpoet quipped just before the tour kicked off 
friday amid the thumping of bongo drums at os angeles club poets 
are those guys with skinny chests who cant play guitars very well 
the audience largely bearded buckskinjacketed and middleaged 
howled its approval

millions of americans plagued by an uncontrollable 
impulse to yank out their hair can get control of their bizarre 
habit and stop themselves from going bald by taking a new medicine 
researchers report today 
experts say it has become evident in recent years that this 
affliction is common even though most victims keep it secret by 
wearing wigs or fake eye brows 
in a report in the new england journal of medicine doctors show 
that an experimental drug called clomipramine can help people reduce 
their hair pulling and sometimes stop it entirely 
the drug allows them to say no said dr susan e swedo 
they still have the urge but their ability to resist it 
increased 
no one knows precisely how many people pull out their hair a 
disorder known as trichotillomania estimates range as high as 8 
million americans although swedo said that between 2 million and 4 
million is probably more accurate virtually all of them are women 
researchers said that hair pulling has been poorly recognized in 
part because victims are adept at hiding the consequences of their 
obsession while many wear wigs others lie that they are bald 
because they take chemotherapy some who have a fringe of hair comb 
the remaining strands over the top just as balding men do 
they are convinced that they are crazy said swedo they 
have to do this thing that is painful and disgusting yet they 
continue they struggle against it all their lives 
victims of the obsession which frequently starts just after 
puberty often dont realize they have a treatable disorder that 
affects millions of people in fact nine of the patients who took 
part in the latest study sought doctors help after learning about a 
related ailment known as obsessivecompulsive disorder on a 
television report last year 
swedo a researcher at the national institute of mental health 
tested clomipramine on 13 women three completely stopped pulling 
their hair while the rest had at least a 50 percent reduction in 
the severity of their symptoms 
the same drug has also been shown in other studies to be 
effective in helping people with obsessivecompulsive disorder the 
medicine has not yet been approved by the us food and drug 
administration for routine use however doctors can obtain it from 
its maker cibageigy for treating severe cases 
a newly approved drug called fluoxetine or prozac also appears 
to be effective against obsessivecompulsive disorder and hair 
pulling although it has not been as widely tested as clomipramine 
dr michael a jenike of massachusetts general hospital said that 
until the development of these medicines obsessivecompulsive 
disorder was considered to be untreatable now we can get many 
people completely better or at least well enough so they can 
function its not an exaggeration to call this a breakthrough 
the obsessive compulsive foundation estimates that as many as 5 
million americans have the anxiety disorder typically they have 
irrational compulsions to do something over and over such as wash 
their hands or make sure the door is locked they may wash for five 
hours a day or check the door 50 or 60 times even though they 
realize the repetition is senseless 
both clomipramine and fluoxetine can also be used to treat 
depression the drugs appear to relieve hair pulling and other 
obsessive behavior by increasing the brains supply of a chemical 
messenger known as serotonin 
in the latest study patients successively took clomipramine and 
another depression medicine called desipramine while they got 
markedly better on clomipramine the other drug had little effect 
swedo said that clomipramine may work best when combined with 
behavior modification training 
you can decrease symptoms by half or threequarters and still 
be bald she said you just dont pull so fast we dont mean to 
imply that clomipramine is the only treatment

babies born into families without medical insurance 
are more likely to start life in poor health probably because of 
limited access to care a study reported today concludes 
the research found that those whose parents have no insurance are 
about onethird more likely than those from insured families to die 
or be seriously ill at birth 
the study was not designed to definitely pinpoint the cause 
however the authors said they believe that the elevated and 
increasing risks of adverse outcomes in uninsured newborns are 
explained most plausibly by diminished access to care together with 
other factors related to lower socioeconomic status 
the study was based on a review of the records of more than 
146000 births in the san francisco bay area in 1982 1984 and 1986 
during that time the percentage of newborns without health 
insurance increased from 55 percent to 8 percent the increases 
were largest among people of hispanic and asian backgrounds 
by 1986 the chance of an adverse hospital outcome defined as a 
prolonged hospital stay transfer to another hospital or death was 
31 percent greater among the uninsured babies even when racial and 
ethnic differences were taken into account 
the study was directed by dr paula braveman of the university of 
california san francisco and published in todays new england 
journal of medicine 
in an accompanying editorial drs donald m berwick of the 
harvard community health plan and howard h hiatt of brigham and 
womens hospital said they doubted that insurance alone would close 
the gap 
the relations between poverty and poor health are too deep and 
intricate to be disrupted with a mere insurance form they wrote 
among the studys other findings 
in 1986 20 percent of hispanic newborns were uninsured 
compared with 3 percent of blacks 6 percent of whites and 12 
percent of asians 
uninsured blacks were more than twice as likely as insured 
blacks to have sickly newborns 
babies who required transfer to another hospital ran up bills 
averaging nearly 56000 
low birth weight and malnutrition were 28 percent more common in 
newborns without insurance

if us and south korean forces 
attack local officials say this will be the first city hit 
in their eyes the chances of that happening have not faded 
despite 36 years of peace for the 300000 residents of kaeson city 
five miles from the demilitarized zone that divides communist north 
korea from the capitalist usbacked south 
the south makes provocative actions on the air and sea said 
chun gihyon secretary of the city peoples committee all kaeson 
city residents live very vigilantly 
if this is vigilance it is lowkeyed residents stroll by ones 
and twos down willowshaded streets those working in vegetable 
fields near the center of town pause frequently from hoeing to rest 
small children splash in shallow streams while their mothers 
scrub clothes on the rocks dozens of soldiers walk about in 
uniform but they too have a leisurely look 
im not afraid said a woman selling clothing in a department 
store because all korean people are united against attack 
no peace treaty has been signed although an armistice in 1953 
ended three years of fighting that devastated the korean peninsula 
the two sides recently made tentative contacts and relations have 
improved between their superpower allies but chun dismissed these 
developments 
the situation is tense he said kaeson city has no militia 
but authorities have taken measures to save peoples lives and 
property in case of attack from the south chun said but refused to 
give details 
asked if the city held air raid or other defensive drills he 
again demurred saying i am a civilian not a military man but 
chun said the city joined the rest of the nation in twiceyearly 
blackout drills 
to a visitor however kaeson seems less focused on war than on 
tourism dozens of tourists most from socialist countries pass 
through daily to see panmunjom where the armistice was signed 
official tourist brochures advertise kaeson as a major producer 
of the ginseng root alleged to increase energy they praise its 
scenic mountains and waterfalls 
lt col yun ki un a member of the military armistice commission 
that administers the truce said he envisions panmunjom being turned 
into a museum after a peace treaty finally is signed 
but meanwhile he too insisted that the border situation grows 
more tense continually 
he cited the souths refusal to give permission for a south 
korean student who traveled illegally to the north to return home 
across the border she crossed aug 15 and was taken into custody 
but no shots were fired by either side during the crossing which 
the north turned into a political rally 
aside from a few peasants who are allowed to farm inside the 
miledeep portion of the demilitarized zone under northern control 
ordinary north koreans appear not to have access to the zone or 
truce village 
the way is blocked by an ironbar fence guarded by armed soldiers 
and two large floodlights electrified barbed wire lines part of the 
road inside the zone and yun acknowledged that the zone itself is 
mined 
the 46yearold yun said he had learned in 20 years of border 
duty that if the us government decides something in connection 
with the korean question you can feel it here immediately 
american soldiers stationed at the border as part of the un 
force that aided the south in the war always feel hostility and 
act like that yun said sometimes he said they hold their 
pistols in a threatening way or pat their holsters 
the south in turn accuses the north of provocative behavior 
and the two governments regularly exchange heated words 
for all that the last violent incident at panmunjom was in 1984 
when according to yun the un command on the southern side 
captured one of our tourists from the ussr 
the un command said the soviet defected by running across the 
demarcation line and that rifletoting north korean guards crossed 
in pursuit un guards opened fire killing four north koreans 
yun said he has become friends with officers from such neutral 
countries as switzerland and sweden who also are stationed at 
panmunjom why not he said adding that they sometimes share a 
drink 
with american officers such comraderie is rarer but sometimes 
he said when i meet with americans in uniform i can find them 
personally friendly 
perhaps someday he said we can meet each other with smiles

the legal fight over how to protect endangered 
sea turtles from drowning in the nets of gulf coast shrimpers has 
moved into the us court of appeals 
the national wildlife federation asked the appeals court here 
wednesday to reinstate a law requiring shrimpers to use devices that 
let sea turtles escape their nets 
the group is challenging commerce secretary robert mosbachers 
decision allowing shrimpers to limit trawling time to 105 minutes in 
lieu of turtle excluder devices known as teds 
the federation was rebuffed tuesday by a us district court 
judge who refused the groups request that shrimpers be required to 
immediately return to using teds 
conservationists argue that only teds are effective in preventing 
thousands of endangered sea turtles from becoming caught in 
shrimpers nets and drowning 
the temporary regulations on restricted tow times drafted under 
a court order by us district judge thomas hogan are in effect 
through sept 8 when mosbacher must issue final rules 
mosbacher suspended enforcement of the teds regulations july 24 
after a weekend of protests by shrimpers who say the devices reduce 
their catch and threaten their livelihood

the national transportation safety board is 
recommending the use of failsafe mechanisms on airliner cargo 
door latches to prevent doors from ope and ensure they are properly 
closed before takeoffs 
nine people aboard a united airlinesof a plane and killed in 
february because of an apparent cargo door failure the ntsb said 
wednesday that its investigation of that incident shows that the 
original design of the doors on boeing 747 models does not profor 
the failsafe features intended 
the ntsbs sevenpage safety recommendation to the fen 
administration said airliners should have redundant indicators to 
directly pinpoint the position of latch cam on the cargo doors 
the board also recommended torquelimiting devices be installed 
on both the manual and electrical drives for cargo door latches to 
prevent damage to the lock mechanisms during their operation 
while saying not determined the cause of the feb 24 accident 
over the pacific ocean the board said the evidence strongly 
suggests that the forward cargo door opened in flight and led to the 
subsequent damage 
yet to be determined the board said is whether the cargo door 
was not latched or only partially latched before takeoff or if it 
became unlatched

the federal trade commission says the new 
england motor rate bureau illegally fixed rates charged by carriers 
hauling goods in massachusetts and new hampshire 
the commission by a 31 vote wednesday ordered the bostonbased 
bureau to halt its collective ratemaking activities in most states 
and to cancel within six months all tariffs it has filed in those 
states 
the commission charged nemrb and its member carriers in 1983 
saying that they hindered competition in massachusetts rhode island 
and new hampshire 
the opinion noted that in massachusetts the state department of 
public utilities didnt exercise its supervisory authority over 
rates subjecting the nemrbs collective rate paying to federal 
antitrust scrutiny 
new hampshire neither reviews rates nor has the authority to 
suspend or reject rates the ftc noted in rhode island however 
the laws met the federal requirements for being exempt from federal 
antitrust regulation 
nemrb offices were closed and no representative could be 
identified to reach after hours for comment

the government said it is investigating reports 
that israelis trained assassination squads for drug traffickers in 
colombia 
one source told the associated press that two such mercenaries 
were smuggled out of colombia after the nations leading 
presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan was gunned down 
friday at a political rally drug traffickers were blamed for the 
slaying 
the source spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity he has close ties to israels defense department and was 
involved in an israeli tv report 
the foreign ministry said the government was investigating 
whether israelis were training hit squads for the notorious medellin 
drug cartel 
the israeli government said any citizens involved were acting on 
their own illegally but critics said the actions still could damage 
israels interests 
it blemishes israel said amnon rubinstein leader of the 
leftwing shinui party 
an nbc news report tuesday included film purportedly showing 
israelis during training sessions the film also was shown on 
israeli television 
israel tv said the man in the nbc film was identified by israeli 
weapons dealers in colombia 
it said colombias secret service ordered the weapons dealers to 
tell all israeli army experts involved in training forces for drug 
cartels to leave the country immediately after galans slaying 
shortly after the warning a number of israelis were 
hurriedly smuggled from the country the television said 
the itim news agency also reported israeli mercenaries were 
spirited out of colombia after the killing 
israeli tv identified three colonels in israels military reserve 
it said were involved in colombia yair klein avraham tzadaka and 
yaakov brine 
in the nbc film one man pictured in a group wearing fatigues 
could be heard saying in hebrew that it was a good exercise and 
everything went well 
israel television identified that man as klein 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity said klein 
commanded the israeli paratroopers antiterror unit in 1983 he 
said klein traveled to colombia in 1985 where he set up a security 
company called hod hahanit or glory of the spear 
the television said a spokesman for hod hahanit would not say if 
it was klein who appeared in the broadcast or if he was involved in 
training paramilitary forces in colombia 
it said hod hahanit employs several highranking israeli 
officers including three other reserve colonels 
the television identified them as tzadaka a former paratroop 
commander brine a helicopter expert formerly with the air force 
and a third reserve colonel not named who had commanded a tank 
brigade 
one israeli source insisting on anonymity said the united 
states had asked israel to look into the role of its citizens 
the foreign ministry said any involvement by israelis would 
involve individuals who are acting on their own in violation 
of israeli law and contrary to israeli policy which is strongly 
committed to the war on drugs 
cmdr yehoshua caspi investigations chief for the national 
police requested that colombia provide israel with any information 
on drugrelated activities of israeli citizens 
rubinstein said israel could block such mercenaries through a law 
that forbids exsoldiers from using their military training abroad 
without defense ministry approval 
benny tal head of a security company with clients overseas said 
israelis with military skills often are lured by the lucrative pay 
of mercenary work

a small golden statue of a horse that remained 
buried for five years despite the efforts of puzzlesolvers around 
the world has been unearthed after a deadline passed and the 
500000 prize reverted to charity 
the site where the treasure was buried remains a secret much to 
the dismay of those who spent time and money trying to solve clues 
in treasure in search of golden horse a yarn released in 1984 
as a book videotape and laser disc 
because nobody found the treasure by a may 26 deadline under 
rules of the contest the right to an annuity worth 25000 a year 
for 20 years passed to a charitable organization big brothers and 
big sisters of america 
an employee returned to the charitys philadelphia headquarters 
on wednesday with the horse which carried the key to a safedeposit 
box containing rights to the 500000 
its a handsome little statue about eight inches from nose to 
tail the retriever said the gold alone is worth nearly 12000 
the retriever said he insisted on anonymity because he didnt 
want to be badgered by people who want him to reveal the secret to 
get the money big brothers had to pledge to keep mum 
it was just the way the contest promised at an open public 
place accessible for anyone to dig 24 hours a day said the 
retriever 
the sponsors said only three people knew where the horse was 
buried the tales two authors and thomas conlon president of the 
dl blair sales promotion company which oversaw the contest 
conlon announced in june that the solution would never be revealed 
big brothers and sisters employees began hearing from angry 
solutionseekers right after the organization was designated to get 
the money but long before it learned where the treasure was 
the employee said he came up from philadelphia to meet conlon in 
new york on monday and together they flew by commercial airplane 
the next day they bought a pick and shovel rented a car and drove 
to the secret treasure site 
they were met there by author sheldon renan and in less than half 
an hour unearthed the golden horse from a box in 2 feet of soft 
rocky soil 
the hole also had a bottle of champagne left by renan when he 
buried the treasure in 1984 
we each had a sip and emptied the remainder on the spot when we 
filled in the hole said the retriever 
in addition to collecting the 500000 the charity also will 
sell the golden horse which contains a kilogram of pure gold and 
cost about 25000 to fabricate said david davison assistant 
executive director of the youth service organization

some seattle residents wish money magazine had 
focused more on the citys clouds or its losing baseball team when 
it ranked us cities and decided seattle is best 
did they do that to us moaned emmett watson a seattle times 
columnist and selfappointed leader of lesser seattle a humorous 
antibooster entity that delights in bashing newcomers particularly 
californians i wouldnt dispute that seattle is better than 
detroit and cleveland and other such places 
but it frightens me and appalls me that everybody thinks 
theyre coming to paradise 
after you come here you still have the problems of paying off 
your credit cards and moping about the schools and getting stuck in 
traffic jams 
in its september issue money ranked danbury conn which the 
magazine tabbed as the best place to live last year no 2 and san 
francisco no 3 in a ranking of 300 us cities 
and if being right on the money isnt enough seattle was chosen 
by savvy magazine in its september issue as the nations secondbest 
place to raise children behind minneapolisst paul 
for several years the northwests largest city has consistently 
placed high in surveys about quality of life where to locate new 
businesses and tourist destinations 
tom hobson seattle chamber of commerce spokesman said the new 
survey is just one more piece of evidence that seattle really is a 
nice place to live 
there are a lot of people who would say they surveys dont 
mean anything each one individually he said but i think in 
the conglomerate seattle always finds itself in the top 10 i am 
not surprised by it anymore i think this is a great place to live 
last year seattle placed 11th in moneys first survey two years 
ago the winner was nashua nh which this year was ranked fifth 
boosters say seattle is attractive in part because of its robust 
economy the boeing co the areas largest employer is busy 
filling record numbers of airplane orders tourism is strong and 
the docks of puget sound hum with international trade activity last 
year washington state bucked national deficits by posting a 74 
billion trade surplus 
moneys survey was conducted by asking a sample of its 
subscribers to rank 10 attributes in order of what was most 
important to them in a place to live the samples median age was 41 
and household income was 42500 
the most important attribute this year was availability of 
hospitals and doctors followed by the likelihood of house 
appreciation and affordability of housing money said 
a low crime rate the top concern the past two years fell to no 
4 in the latest survey followed by public transportation public 
schools and colleges weather leisure opportunities and the arts 
including libraries 
using those priorities the rankings then were made on the basis 
of an array of government and private data 
other cities in the money top 10 were no 4 denver 6 boston 7 
bostons north shore 8 central new jersey 9 minneapolisst

the us dollar rose thursday against the japanese 
yen in tokyo while share prices lost ground in quiet trading 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which lost 22107 points wednesday dropped another 
10673 points or 03 percent closing the day at 3478655 
the dollar finished trading at 14360 yen up 125 yen from 
wednesdays close of 14235 yen after opening higher at 14345 yen 
the us currency ranged between 14337 and 14383 yen 
traders said the dollar gained ground due to news reports that a 
key official in the cabinet of prime minister toshiki kaifu would 
resign over a sex scandal 
in a nationally televised news conference late thursday morning 
chief cabinet secretary tokuo yamashita apologized saying that 
such news would be reported was due completely to my own 
indiscretion 
yamashita 69 who is the governments main spokesman said he 
was seriously considering whether to resign or stay in office 
yamashitas remarks were prompted by an article in the respected 
weekly shukan shincho magazine alleging that starting in 1984 he 
had an affair with a 26yearold office worker he met at a tokyo bar 
where she worked part time it said the affair ended in 1987 
on the stock market securities dealers said traders were 
discouraged by a decline in the value of the yen against the dollar 
also contributing to the drop in the index were reports of the 
yamashita affair said masahiro umemori an equity researcher at 
nomura securities co

slain black panther party cofounder huey 
p newton whose cry of power to the people electrified the 
civil rights movement struggled with the legend that surrounded 
him according to family and friends 
as police continued searching for clues to his predawn slaying a 
day earlier loved ones and associates wednesday offered their 
insights into the man whose radical views including the use of 
violence heightened black militancy 
the black panthers were the ultimate symbol of that social 
movement but in the view of many in law enforcement the panthers 
were as described in the 1960s by the fbi hoodlumtype 
revolutionaries stockpiling weapons espousing marxistleninist 
doctrines and terrorizing black communities 
black leaders and other admirers of newtons chafed at portrayals 
of him as a gangster and said such statements could stir racial 
tensions and lead to a violent backlash 
a lot of black people are very angered by the fact that huey 
newton is getting put in the box of being a gangster said the 
rev cecil williams of the glide memorial united methodist church in 
san francisco that only incites people and could lead to acts of 
violence 
no suspects have been identified in newtons killing and no 
motive offered by police although authorities speculated the 
slaying could have been drug or gangrelated or an act of random 
violence or an aborted robbery 
were making some progress but nothing significant said 
oakland police lt mike sims 
about 50 mourners some of whom said newtons philosophy helped 
blacks battle racism gathered wednesday for a second night in the 
druginfested neighborhood of rundown victorianstyle houses where 
newton 47 was gunned down 
those who knew him well met with reporters at his brothers home 
he was certainly a lonely man in that we didnt have any more 
fights any more struggles said former panther leader david 
hilliard we talked a lot about loneliness and our desire to 
recreate the energy of the 60s 
he regretted that he was not more successful at eradicating 
sexism racism and classism 
newtons latest plans were to make a film about environmental 
problems which he believed were linked to the oppression of 
minorities said his brother melvin 
newtons wife of almost five years fredrika 37 said her 
husband had been feeling well and spending a lot of time at her home 
in berkeley while recuperating from two recent abdominal operations 
she denied reports that newton had a drug problem or a 
girlfriend saying he was a devoted husband and father to her son 
from a previous marriage 
newton was incarcerated for 90 days earlier this year for 
possession of drug paraphernalia 
but newtons older brother would not comment on reports of 
newtons drug problems instead portraying the slain leader as a man 
who devoted himself years ago to the struggle for social justice 
he had no particular concerns about his own life said melvin 
newton he felt that once he decided to be a revolutionary he was 
in a position of suicide anyway

students at a suburban high school can continue to 
use confederate symbols for their sports teams after a federal judge 
ruled that the symbols may be distressing but are nonetheless legal 
i have to apply the law even if i disagree with it us 
district judge jerry buchmeyer told officials of the naacp and the 
garland independent school district on wednesday 
south garland high school has a flag that resembles a confederate 
flag except for a drawing in the middle said ed cloutman attorney 
for the national association for the advancement of colored people 
the schools fight song is sung to the tune of dixie and a 
school mascot dresses like a confederate army officer 
the naacp asked buchmeyer to forbid the district from using them 
calling the symbols disruptive and racist 
theres no question in the courts mind of the effect these 
symbols have had on those who object to them but the symbols 
have not resulted in violence or disruption and have not been used 
to prohibit blacks from taking part in extracurricular activities 
buchmeyer said 
naacp southwest regional director rev richard dockery said he 
respected the judges ruling 
we have no problem with the judges ruling as it relates to his 
imposing and enforcing the law upholding the law as he stated the 
law dockery said even though he ruled against us i respect 
his decision 
dockery said there are no immediate plans to appeal or to ask the 
school district to voluntarily change the symbols school 
superintendent jill shugart indicated that the district would not 
likely eliminate them 
it was the school board and the administrations position that 
those symbols had been selected years ago by the students and we 
had had no evidence of student disruption or problems ms shugart 
said 
the administration asked the student leadership to review the 
question last year after a series of meetings the students 
recommended that the symbols remain ms shugart said she would be 
reluctant to intervene in that decision 
south garland high school has 2350 students about 80 percent of 
them white ms shugart said cloutman said he believed about 10 
percent of the students are black

todays teenagers may become tomorrows aids 
victims unless they learn the rules of safe sex say researchers who 
found that teens primarily use condoms for reasons other than 
preventing disease 
in a study of 506 youths researchers at the university of 
californias san francisco campus found that teenagers largely use 
condoms to allow easy and spontaneous sex 
among male adolescents as was found with female adolescents the 
intention to use condoms in the next year was not associated with 
believing that condoms prevent stds sexually transmitted diseases 
or that condoms are effective in preventing pregnancy the authors 
wrote 
the researchers said the results show that although sexually 
transmitted diseases other than aids are rampant among teens most 
youths think they are immune 
the findings come amidst a push by health professionals to curb 
the disease rate as well as teen pregnancies by encouraging condom 
use and indicate the approach should be geared more toward concerns 
expressed by youths in the study susan kegeles the leading 
researcher said wednesday 
she said health professionals are concerned that the same type of 
sexual behavior that leads to diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis 
frequent sex with multiple partners is putting teens at risk for 
developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
we know right now that 20 percent of people who have aids are 
in their twenties and since the disease usually isnt diagnosed 
until years after exposure most of those people in their twenties 
probably contracted it when they were teenagers said ms 
kegeles a research psychologist at the center for aids prevention 
studies at the san francisco campus 
health factors such as aids prevention are the most emphasized 
issue in trying to get teens to use condoms ms kegeles said 
but what we found was that although they knew that condoms 
prevent disease that wasnt connected with their intent to use 
them she said 
the study published in the august issue of the chicagobased 
american journal of diseases of children is based on surveys of 
youths who attended two health clinics in the san francisco area 
from february 1984 to september 1985 
the mean age was about 16 for girls and boys thirtytwo percent 
of the girls and 43 percent of the boys were virgins of those who 
were sexually active 59 percent of the girls and 63 percent of the 
boys had used condoms 
teens were asked if they were going to have sex in the next year 
and what factors would be involved in their decision to use condoms 
though other forms of birth control were not addressed in the 
condom survey the factors cited by teens would relate to a choice 
of condoms over three other forms of contraception the diaphragm 
birthcontrol pills or withdrawal 
ease of use enabling one to have sex on the spur of the 
moment and popularity with peers were among factors listed by both 
sexes 
the latest statistics from the national centers for disease 
control in atlanta show that among teens ages 15 to 19 195312 
cases of gonorrhea were reported in 1988 or 10753 cases per 
100000

a team of scientists from the united states and 
canada believe they have discovered the fatal gene defect that 
causes cystic fibrosis 
the team of molecular biologists scheduled news conferences today 
in toronto and washington to report on the discovery details of 
which are to be published in the scientific journal science next 
month 
this is one of the most significant discoveries in the history 
of human genetics dr ronald worton chief geneticist at 
torontos hospital for sick childrens said wednesday 
the discovery is a crucial step toward developing either a new 
treatment or a cure for the inherited disease the most common 
genetic defect in whites about half of those who suffer from the 
disease dont live to adulthood 
scientists say about 12 million americans about five percent 
carry the gene for the disease but a child must inherit it from 
both parents to be affected about 30000 people in the united 
states have cystic fibrosis todays new york times said 
cystic fibrosis a disorder of the breathing system pancreas and 
sweat glands is so debilitating that few who have it live past 
their 20s 
parents should be absolutely optimistic and excited about 
this dr robert beall executive vice president for medical 
affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation in bethesda md told the 
times 
we have been in a bottleneck and now we have magnificent 
opportunities before us said beall 
the disease affects secretory cells causing the lungs pancreas 
and skin to produce too much mucous and retain an excess of sodium 
ions 
treatment includes a variety of medications and more recently 
double lung transplants although eventually a new lung will become 
irreparably damaged also 
lapchee tsui at sick childrens heads the team with the 
collaboration of francis collins of the university of michigan at 
ann arbor he stresses that finding the defective gene isnt a cure 
first we need to have the actual gene tsui said then we 
have to find out what the gene does or does not do that causes the 
disease 
genes are units of dna the molecule of heredity before the 
chemical structure of a gene is identified it must be located on 
one of the 46 chromosomes found in every human cell 
its like hunting for a needle in a haystack tsui said 
scientists say they will now focus on how the gene functions and 
how the defect can be rectified

venezuela increased its forces on the 
border to keep out drug dealers who may try to escape a crackdown in 
neighboring colombia president carlos andres perez said 
in bolivia authorities said wednesday that border patrols also 
were reinforced and police helicopters were on alert for colombian 
traffickers 
perez also proposed that nations of the western hemisphere hold a 
summit to come up with strategies to combat drug trafficking 
narcotics trafficking has to be fought as the most abominable 
crime of the century the venezuelan leader said late tuesday in a 
speech at the anniversary celebration of a cooperative educational 
institute 
perez said it also would have to be considered a crime without 
frontiers to combat effectively 
venezuelan press accounts have warned of the possibility of drug 
smugglers entering venezuela to escape the recent crackdown in 
colombia 
perez said venezuela had tightened patrols along its 1000mile 
border with colombia traditionally an area plagued by smuggling and 
guerrilla activity 
venezuela does not have a history of drug trafficking although 
it is being increasingly used as a transfer point for cocaine and 
other drugs being smuggled to europe and the united states 
according to police 
in bolivia however there are dozens of cocaine processing labs 
in the northern beni jungle region and officials increased patrols 
along bolivias border with brazil 
the us drug enforcement administration has said that the raw 
material for at least onethird of the cocaine that reaches us and 
european markets is produced in bolivia 
the violence and corruption that exists in colombia could be 
transferred to bolivia especially because of the offensive by the 
colombian government said bolivia sen daniel cabezas head of 
the senate committee on drugs 
in june two colombian drug traffickers were captured when police 
raided the town of santa ana de yacuma home to some of bolivias 
top cocaine traffickers there have been several killings in santa 
cruz 450 miles east of la paz involving colombian drug runners 
police have said 
at least 350000 bolivians make their livings growing coca 
leaves the leaves are processed into cocaine paste which is 
refined into cocaine

with a toast to greenhouse glasnost 
robert redford opened a ussoviet conference on global warming 
that organizers hope will help bind the two countries in 
environmental action 
our nations have competed for so long and so destructively the 
waste of resources has been a very real and human tragedy the 
actorfilmmaker told 200 people who gathered wednesday night at his 
sundance resort in central utahs wasatch mountains i drink to 
peace and i drink to healing our planet 
eleven soviets and more than 80 us participants are attending 
the fourday symposium cosponsored by the soviet academy of 
sciences and the institute for resource management a nonprofit 
group redford founded in 1981 
what were attempting to do is to get not just scientists 
talking to scientists or governments talking to governments said 
terry minger the institutes president scientists will lay out 
the problem but we also have businessmen filmmakers authors 
artists and environmentalists 
sen bill bradley dnj praised the ussoviet cooperation 
all of us see the lands vulnerability to abuse he said and 
we recognize that its potential for giving us rebirth may be 
slipping away 
also expected to participate were astronomer carl sagan 
biologist paul ehrlich former interior secretary stewart udall 
idaho gov cecil andrus and sens tim wirth dcolo and john 
heinz rpa 
last summers drought and heat wave helped thrust global warming 
into the public eye 
scientists disagree on whether the hot spell was a natural 
variation or the start of the greenhouse effect an atmospheric 
warming caused by industrial and auto pollution that trap solar heat 
but most researchers agree that the greenhouse effect has the 
potential for melting the polar ice caps raising sea levels and 
changing weather patterns worldwide 
were taking the premise that in fact global climate change is 
taking place minger said as two leading nations what do we do 
about it 
the united states and soviet union produce about half the gases 
mostly carbon dioxide believed responsible for global warming he 
said 
this greenhouse glasnost is something weve been working on 
jointly for a year and a half minger said this is a very 
important issue to them 
minger hopes the conference will urge action on global warming by 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
other plans include setting up joint projects to monitor forest 
growth in the two countries joint educational programs and a joint 
filmmaking venture

japans new government suffered its first setback 
today when a top cabinet official said he was considering resigning 
following disclosures that he had an extramarital affair 
chief cabinet secretary tokuo yamashita 69 apologized for the 
indiscretion 
it was the second sex scandal this summer involving a member of 
the governing liberal democratic party and the first crisis for the 
government created two weeks ago by prime minister toshiki kaifu 
kaifu speaking to reporters as he headed to a special meeting 
with party leaders said the question of resigning should be 
decided by the politician himself he did not comment further 
one party faction led by former finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa said a cabinet member should take responsibility 
meaning resign if he has damaged the governments reputation said 
a faction official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
kaifu met for two hours with party secretary general ichiro ozawa 
and members of the party political reform committee they left 
without speaking to reporters 
the tense atmosphere followed the disclosure that yamashita the 
cabinets spokesman and coordinator had an affair with a woman 
almost 45 years younger than himself he and his wife of more than 
40 years kyoko have four grown daughters 
yamashita said at a nationally televised morning news conference 
that he was seriously considering whether to resign following 
disclosures that he had an affair 
that such news would be reported was due completely to my own 
indiscretion said yamashita kaifus top aide 
the task of the kaifu cabinet is to promote clean government 
and as i must follow that and support the prime minister i can 
offer only my deepest apologies to the people of japan he said 
yamashita told reporters after the party leaders met that he was 
still analyzing opinions and trying to make up my mind whether 
to resign 
one way or the other the decision has to come before long 
he said 
asked if the situation had any impact on kaifus trip to the 
united states canada and mexico next week yamashita merely said he 
was considering whether it had any impact 
the public is not going to tolerate such insensitivity of 
political leaders said yotaro konaka a prominent author and 
critic on social issues people must doubt if the new government 
which appointed such a person to its top post just when political 
ethics has become a national issue has any common sense at all 
if yamashita resigns konaka said other top politicians would be 
under similar pressure 
masaya ito a prominent political analyst said the scandal is 
unlikely to cause fatal damage to the kaifu administration because 
it does not directly involve the prime minister 
but it is particularly damaging for kaifu in a sense that the 
public is not going to believe what he says from now on after such a 
disgusting scandal he said 
japanese society has long been tolerant of rich and powerful men 
having affairs and mistresses and such matters seldom were reported 
in national media but the taboo was broken in june when a respected 
weekly magazine published an interview with an exgeisha who said 
thenprime minister sousuke uno had paid her to be his mistress 
uno had been in office less than a week and uproar over the 
allegation contributed to his downfall and to the low popularity of 
the liberal democrats who are reeling from a bribery scandal and 
from public dislike of a new 3 prcent sales tax 
uno resigned and was succeeded by kaifu after the liberal 
democrats suffered a massive defeat in the july 23 election and lost 
their majority in the upper house of parliament 
in yamashitas case the respected weekly shukan shincho reported 
in its issue released today that he started an affair with an office 
worker and parttime bar hostess in 1984 when she was 21 the 
magazine said the affair lasted for more than three years during 
which time he served as transport minister and head of the 
management and coordination agency 
it reported that he gave her 21000 on aug 3 when there was 
speculation he would get a high post in the new government the 
woman who was not identified has returned the money according to 
the magazine 
yamashita a seventerm lawmaker who had a reputation as a clean 
politician denied the money was intended to keep her from talking 
about the affair 
i did it from my own good intentions after hearing that shes 
still having problems in her life he was quoted as saying

prince georges county is posting 
stickers next to all 32000 county gutters reminding residents that 
what goes into the sewers eventually winds up in the chesapeake bay 
do not litter chesapeake bay drainage read the stickers 
which officials hope to complete distributing in the next two years 
storm drains are for rain only and not for oil and not for 
grass clippings and not for styrofoam said county executive 
parris n glendening 
some home mechanics and home gardeners dump their oil waste and 
yard waste in storm drains on saturday glendening said wednesday 
on sunday they go to the bay and bemoan the oil slicks and other 
pollutants some people think it goes to sewage treatment plants 
but not so 
prince georges county is the first in the state to place 
warnings on storm gutters although other counties encourage 
community groups to do so 
county environmental officials estimate that about half of the 
organic pollutants in the bay nitrogen and phosphorus come from 
storm water runoff collected by storm gutters the two elements 
when present in extreme quantities deoxygenate water and disrupt 
the bays ecological balance

east germany has openly acknowledged for the first 
time the existence of secret protocols in the 1939 nonaggression 
pact between nazi germany and the soviet union 
the communist east german leadership strongly defended the pact 
saying the treaty gave moscow time to prepare for war 
communist party historian heinz kuehnrich said in a newspaper 
interview wednesday that the pact which contained protocols that 
put the thenindependent baltic republics into the soviet orbit was 
essential to moscows defense strategy 
the soviet union gained territory for its defense against nazi 
aggression kuehnrich told the junge welt newspaper a party 
organ for young people 
on aug 23 1939 hitler and stalin divided eastern europe into 
spheres of influence within days nazi germany invaded poland the 
soviet union later occupied eastern poland 
less than a year later stalin took over the baltic states of 
estonia latvia and lithuania that action is now an explosive issue 
in the soviet baltic region with the 50year anniversary sparking 
increased demands for independence 
western accounts say the pact paved the way for the beginning of 
world war ii 
kuehnrich called the interpretation nonsense that stands the 
facts on their heads 
he denied the pact set the stage for war 
the timing of the pact and the beginning of war has been used 
to trick people into believing that the soviet union was partly 
responsible for the war the historian said 
hitler wanted war not the soviet union kuehnrich said

government employees who graduated from college in 
1985 or later have been ordered to work one to two years in 
grassroots units to improve their political understanding 
officials said today 
the move is part of new government efforts since the crushed 
spring prodemocracy protests to make youth both red or 
politically sound and expert in ominous echoes of the far leftist 
cultural revolution 
the communist party newspaper the peoples daily said that 
youths still in school who create disturbances rather than study 
will be expelled and could face criminal prosecution 
the newspaper directed a lengthy editorial at college students 
many of whom are resuming class this month students from today 
must conscientiously study marxistleninistmao tsetung thought 
and study the partys line it said 
the new order affecting graduates for the past four years 
reflects deep government suspicion over the political reliability of 
an entire generation of educated youth many young government 
workers marched in the studentled protests for a freer society that 
ended with a bloody army attack on june 34 
earlier this month education officials denied reports that all 
recent graduates were being sent out of the capital 
however this weeks culture news the culture ministrys 
newspaper said college graduates assigned to work in the ministry 
first must join in unspecified group study and then spend one to 
two years receiving training in an enterprise under the 
ministrys jurisdiction 
it said the graduates residence permits will be switched from 
beijing to their new location and that those who do not perform 
well will not be allowed to return to the ministry china tries to 
limit the population of its cities and beijing residence permits 
are especially difficult to obtain 
every office of the ministry must help these comrades to 
raise their political and professional quality the paper said 
the culture ministry contacted by telephone confirmed the 
report but said it did not know how many employees were affected 
when they would leave for their new jobs or exactly where they would 
go 
the ministry of broadcast film and television and academy of 
social sciences also confirmed such an order was issued but said 
they had not begun sending their recent graduates to new jobs the 
defense ministry and state education commission said they were not 
accepting any new graduates this year 
students who had planned to start graduate studies this september 
also must undergo what is called grassroots training the 
government announced recently this usually means working in a 
county town 
some observers have likened it to the 196676 far leftist 
cultural revolution when virtually all of chinas college and 
middle school students were sent to work on farm communes many were 
never able to regain their city residence permits 
now however the communes no longer exist and there is no 
indication the youth will be put to work planting rice or feeding 
pigs 
education officials said a 1983 regulation called for all college 
graduates to spend a year at the grassroots before joining central 
government offices but it never was enforced 
students said usually only the most politically active youths 
chose to work at the grassroots in hopes of gaining party membership 
most beijing college students return to class this month and face 
several weeks of concentrated political study the peoples daily 
editorial acknowledged continued campus unrest the minds of the 
students are far from calm it said it said the political study 
should help them begin the school year with their minds at rest 
it reiterated government pledges to punish only the ringleaders 
of the sevenweek democracy movement 
hundreds of students professors and other intellectuals have 
been arrested since june 34 along with thousands of workers the 
president of beijing university whose students led the protests 
was replaced wednesday 
the government has stopped announcing most arrests but the 
official radio in the southeastern province of guangdong reported 
today that five people were arrested there for plotting to smuggle a 
wanted student leader from the country 
it said the five had entered china from hong kong but did not 
make clear if they were hong kong residents it said three of the 
five were students and were released while two remained in custody 
the wanted student zheng xuguang was arrested in july police said 
weeks ago

immigration officials will change the color of 
immigrant work permits commonly known as green cards to prevent 
counterfeiters from duplicating the documents 
the new cards to be issued to aliens who have achieved 
permanentresident status are rosecolored on the front and will 
bear the photograph signature and fingerprint of the worker the 
reverse side will bear pinktoblue rainbow shading to cut down on 
forgeries the immigration and naturalization service said wednesday 
the more you change the color the more confusing it is to 
counterfeiters explained neil henry deputy los angeles district 
director for legalization for the ins 
officials say the temporary work permits probably will still be 
called green cards however the cards havent been green since the 
1960s henry said but the name has stuck through several color 
changes most recently blue and offwhite 
the immigration service does not plan to replace the 10 million 
cards already in circulation verne jervis an ins spokesperson in 
washington told the new york times the new cards will be phased 
in issued to new aliens workers who have lost their cards or 
permanent residents children when they reach age 14 
ins western regional director bill king said the cards will be 
issued in conjunction with ins plans to begin accepting applications 
for seasonal agricultural worker status 
the fouryear program will permit noncitizen participants to 
legally enter or remain in the united states as agricultural 
workers king said the filing period begins sept 1 and runs 
through nov 30

explorers in a research boat 
returned today for a second glimpse of the wreck of the edmund 
fitzgerald after an initial look showed the ship remarkably intact 
in the cold depths of lake superior 
this is amazing totally amazing archaeologist phil wright 
on board as an observer for the canadian marine heritage 
conservation program in ottawa said wednesday as he watched a 
monitor in the dark control room of the research vessel 
he watched the screen intently as a small submersible robot sent 
up images showing the large white ship upright in the black mud 
its name clearly visible on its side 
the edmund fitzgerald had taken on more than 26 tons of 
concentrated iron ore pellets at superior wis and was bound for 
cleveland when it sank in a gale nov 10 1975 the 729foot vessel 
disappeared in canadian water 17 miles off the coast of northern 
michigan all 29 aboard died their bodies never recovered 
singersongwriter gordon lightfoot recounted the tragedy in a ballad 
that became a popular hit in the 70s 
wednesday researchers lowered a submersible robot carrying 
specialized video cameras 556 feet down to the wreck the view was 
startlingly clear 
the first glimpse was a ghostly faint image of the ships white 
radio tower 
as the robot dropped lower and nearer the battered pilothouse 
loomed onto the screen showing crisp pictures of portholes burst by 
tremendous pressure electronic equipment tossed about within and 
the ships bell with its clapper tied by a cord 
the hull remained white barely dusted with lake sdiment and just 
beginning to rust where the force of the sinking had bent and ripped 
its steel sides 
it was just like tinfoil said chris nicholson who developed 
and piloted the small video robot attached by cable to the mother 
ship threedimensional images from the robot will enable 
researchers to map details of the fitzgerald down to the centimeter 
searchers had expected to encounter bodies of some of the 
fitzgeralds american crew but none was seen in wednesdays initial 
exploration 
we are not here to disturb we are only here to remember 
said clifford wilson captain of the research boat grayling on 
loan for the expedition from the us fish and wildlife service 
wilson held a short shipboard memorial service for the crew before 
the robot was lowered 
tom farnquist director of the lakes shipwreck historical 
society said the reason for the search was to produce sharp color 
footage of the wreck to satisfy public curiosity 
the expedition coordinated by the society is testing the new 
video system for underwater exploration after more looks at the 
fitzgerald today the team hopes to document the deep remains of as 
many as five other ships preserved by the depth and coldness of the

the official us coast guard report concludes the fitzgerald 
sank by taking on water through its hatches as the ship plowed 
through a tremendous storm with waves of up to 35 feet however 
others believe the boat punched a hole in its hull when the waves 
set it down upon a shallow shoal 
either way the boat went down so quickly it disappeared from 
radar within minutes of its captain telling another boat that he was 
holding his own in the storm 
because official conclusions on why the fitzgerald sank differ

activists in the baltics should abandon 
their secessionist mood and negotiate with soviet officials on 
achieving more independence the communist party daily pravda said 
today 
on wednesday hundreds of thousands of people formed a giant 
human chain across the baltics to dramatize their demand for 
independence 
pravda told the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia 
that there is an alternative to secession 
the article said the partys reforms already allow more 
independence to republics within the framework of the soviet union 
and it called for the scrupulous and friendly labor needed to 
implement them 
hundreds of thousands of people stood handinhand across the 
baltic republics wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a secret 
agreement between adolf hitler and josef stalin that put the 
thenindependent republics into the soviet orbit 
the protest organized by grassroots groups in the three 
republics reflected activists growing calls for full independence 
from moscow instead of merely increased sovereignty 
official estimates provided by the tass news agency in moscow 
said 500000 people turned out in lithuania a republic of 37 
million people and that 300000 of estonias 16 million people took 
part 
there was no official estimate from latvia but the peoples 
front grassroots organization in riga said about 400000 of latvias 
27 million people turned out 
ive never lived in an independent lithuania 30yearold 
graphic illustrator audrius ciocys said as he stood on in the line 
with his wife and 3yearold son i believe there will be one 
for my son there must be 
official newspapers in the baltics gave heavy coverage today to 
the human chain one paper in tallinn estonia filled most of its 
front page with reports and pictures of the event and summarized the 
mood with the headline our goal is freedom 
edgar savisaar leader of the estonian peoples front said he 
believed the republics parliament might decide as soon as october 
to issue a republicwide referendum on independence 
miik titma the ideology chief of estonias communist party said 
in that republics capital tallinn that people there were feeling 
more inner freedom and that would lead them to becoming a free 
nation 
estonian peoples front activist heinz valk declared that by 
forming the giant human chain we are proclaiming to each other 
and to the whole world that we in the baltic nations have never 
given up our freedom 
on aug 23 1939 hitler and stalin divided eastern europe into 
spheres of influence and less than a year later stalin annexed the 
baltic states 
in the first reaction by the official soviet media the evening 
tv news program vremya said the human chain should be understood 
not as a demand to leave the soviet union but as a call for 
historic justice 
but it said it would be naive to think that the borders could be 
redrawn 50 years later 
moscow radio today quoted a moscows historians dismissal as 
unlawful any attempts to claim the soviet hold on the baltic 
states is invalid because it stems from the 1939 pact 
estonias government leaders joined the chain at its beginning at 
a medieval tower near the gulf of finland about 370 miles to the 
south in vilnius capital of lithuania demonstrators held candles 
to remember the 1 million lithuanians they say were killed jailed 
or exiled in 50 years of soviet rule 
in tallinn the chain was fourdeep in places and then stretched 
south out of the windy port 
participants still were returning to tallinn at 4 am from a 
protest at the estonianlatvian border where a copy of the 
hitlerstalin agreement was burned in a large bonfire surrounded by 
the flags of the independent baltic states 
witnesses said the highway north of riga toward estonia was 
packed with people 
organizers said they needed 15 million participants to fill up 
the chain and some gaps were reported 
moscow activists tried to organize a sympathy protest in the 
capital but police and a special antidemonstration unit broke it 
up the official tass news agency said 75 people were detained 
in the southwestern soviet republic of moldavia also annexed by 
the soviet union under the secret agreement about 10000 people 
attended an outdoor rally in heavy rain 
they carried the blue red and yellow national flag of moldavia 
as well as the flags of the baltic republics said moldavian 
peoples front activist yuri rozhgo in a telephone interview from 
kishinv the republics capital 
georgian activists said about 1500 people gathered in the 
capital tbilisi on wednesday evening in a demonstration of support 
for the baltic republics

wednesday in the southern french city of st tropez said his son 
adrian he said he did not know the cause of death its a 
shock he said in an interview 
the fire department in st tropez where laing died said the 
cause of death was believed to be heart failure 
an unorthodox pioneer in the treatment of schizophrenics ronald 
david laing jarred traditional psychiatry with his first book the 
divided self an existential study in sanity and madness 
published in 1960 
he rejected notions that schizophrenia is a genetic or biological 
aberration believing instead in the familys role in creating the 
disease although he later became more open to physiological 
theories said his son 
laings views on the strains the nuclear family could put on an 
individuals sanity fell in with the rebellious spirit of the 1960s 
counterculture which made him one of its gurus 
contending that most psychiatry added to patient misery he 
refused to treat them with drugs or electric shocks unless they 
asked for them 
sanity madness and the family written with aa esterson 
and published in 1964 presented case histories based on his 
approach to families 
the politics of experiencethe bird of paradise published 
in 1967 explored the illnesses of society presenting the insane 
the criminal and the revolutionary as mystical explorers in a 
vicious and mechanized world the times of london said 
at kingsley hall the london residential treatment hostel he 
helped to run he experimented with the therapeutic use of mescaline 
and lsd he was a prominent campaigner for the legalization of 
marijuana 
in 1964 he founded the philadelphia association a network of 
households to house the mentally distressed without giving them 
conventional treatment 
although laings work antagonized many conventional 
psychiatrists he was moured as an innovative contributor to modern 
psychiatry 
he made individual contributions to new and constructive 
thinking about the care of psychiatric patients said a statement 
from the royal college of psychiatrists 
the fontana companion to modern thought recognized the continuing 
impact of laings ideas on orthodox british psychiatry as 
witnessed by the greater attention now paid to the dynamics of a 
family one of whose members is disturbed

received his doctorate at glasgow university and served with a 
psychiatric unit in the army before going on to study psychoanalysis

is writing a book on the influence of this on his fathers work his 
survivors also include two sons from a second marriage adam and 
max and a daughter natasha as well as a child benjamin by another 
commonlaw wife said adrian 
he was an antiestablishment character but wasnt an 
antipsychiatrist according to adrian who said he had studied 
his fathers works and accompanied his father to conferences 
he wanted to listen more to what people were saying to look at 
schizophrenic minds from their point of view he said his idea 
was just to let them go crazy just let them go on with it 
he said youve got to understand the politics of the family 
laings other writings included reason and violence the 
politics of experience and his 1985 account of the first 30 years 
of his life the making of a psychiatrist

a 30000 kidneyshaped swimming pool 
built partly on city property is about to go down the drain 
city water commissioners voted wednesday to order developer david 
brady to get rid of the pool which is partly in his back yard and 
partly on land owned by the manchester water works 
brady said he encroached on about 5000 square feet of city land 
by mistake but commissioners said they werent convinced 
the deciding factor apparently was the difference between bradys 
pool proposal on his application for a city building permit and the 
pool that eventually was built 
the permit showed a lap pool entirely on bradys land but the 
finished product was much larger and extended more than 50 feet over 
the property line 
brady says his building crew neglected to get a new permit when 
plans for the pool were changed the commissioners rejected his 
offer to buy or lease the city land for 1 times its market value

dan and chandelle summer dont get to 
argue in court anymore 
summer is an assistant district attorney and his wife is a 
defense attorney they squared off in a burglary trial this year 
but shortly after the case ended in a hung jury district 
attorney c andrew fuller told summer he could no longer handle 
cases involving his wifes clients 
mrs summer sued fuller claiming his policy hurt her business by 
causing delays in court cases when other attorneys had to be found 
to fill in for her husband 
us district judge william c okelley in an order signed last 
week agreed there is no georgia law preventing the two from 
opposing each other in a court case but he also said fuller has the 
right to decide which assistant handles any case 
mrs summer said she plans to appeal her husband declined to 
comment 
i wished the judge had found that harm had been done and gone 
on to decide the underlying issue which is basically marital 
discrimination she said 
there was never a suggestion that we compromised our 
positions she added when we get home were too tired to 
discuss law its boring we argue about other subjects like whos 
going to do the dishes tonight 
fuller said he instituted the policy because he wanted to avoid 
any appearance of impropriety and he had been forming the policy 
for months before the burglary trial 
we want to put forward the image that indicates everyone is 
being represented fairly he said tuesday

nasa and other officials who staged a 
safety drill to simulate a space shuttle explosion that released 
radioactive material said there were a few glitches that need to be 
ironed out 
more than 200 federal state and local officials participated 
wednesday in a sixhour test of the communications network that 
would link all the agencies in case of such an explosion a 
possibility that nasa said is extremely remote 
joel reynolds nasa safety chief said the test simulated a 
launch pad fire that the astronauts were able to escape before the 
shuttle atlantis exploded causing the release of a small amount of 
radiation but not enough to order an evacuation 
it was the type of thing where wed tell people to get inside 
their cars or a building to prevent inhalation of the material he 
said 
reynolds said there were problems with some communications links 
and with a computergenerated model of the radiation dispersal 
pattern 
but thats why we had the exercise to work out the rough spots 
and help us work together as a team he said well sit down 
tomorrow and assess what has to be changed 
atlantis is scheduled for launch oct 12 with the galileo 
spacecraft the crew of five astronauts is to release the payload on 
the start of a sixyear outward trip to orbit the planet jupiter 
galileo will be powered by a pair of 122pound radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators each containing about 24 pounds of highly 
toxic plutonium238 dioxide instruments called thermocouples 
convert the heat released by the plutoniums decay into electricity 
i cant see how those plutonium packages can break apart 
but we want to be prepared reynolds said 
the safety drill involved safety officials from nasa the 
departments of energey and defense the environmental protection 
agency federal emergency management agency and state and local 
radiation protection and law enforcement organizations 
federal law requires that nasa have a written contingency plan 
that would be enacted for any launch accident involving radioactive 
material 
some antinuclear and environmental groups have protested the use 
of plutonioum on a spacecraft citing the 1986 space shuttle 
challenger explosion as an example of how things can go wrong they 
have said the radioactive fallout could result in many incidents of 
cancer in the area 
nasa estimates the odds of another shuttle disaster at somewhere 
between 1in80 and 1in800 
the agency said an exhaustive postchallenger safety review 
indicates the chances of a launch accident in which substantial 
quantities of plutonium pulverized to breathable form could be 
released is about 1in2700 and even then nasa said any 
contamination would be minor 
the nuclear generators were tested to withstand blast pressure 
effects of up to 2000 pounds per square inch the worstcase 
overpressures created in the challenger explosion was between 200 
and 400 psi

shiite moslem militants today vowed to 
attack french warships reported cruising 40 miles off lebanon if 
they approach the coast or seek to aid the countrys beleaguered 
christians 
the threat was made by sheik abbas mousawi a leader of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god after 150 shiite 
officials met in the southern port of tyre to close ranks against 
this americanisraelifrench plot 
the blackturbanned mousawi speaking to reporters after the 
meeting repeatedly stabbed a clenched fist in the air as he 
declared our battle will horrify everybody 
france has said the warships were dispatched on a humanitarian 
mission to evacuate about 7000 french citizens mainly lebanese 
christians with dual nationality if the situation deteriorates 
but syrias allied moslem militias claim the french who once 
ruled lebanon and have traditionally been the christians protector 
are allying with the christian leader gen michel aoun 
his forces besieged in the christian heartland north of beirut 
have been battling the syrians and their allies for five months 
both sides fired sporadic artillery salvoes in and around beirut 
today violating a weekold ceasefire 
police said one person was killed and three wounded that raised 
the casualty toll since the fighting erupted march 8 to 791 killed 
and 2208 wounded 
soviet envoy gennady tarasov arrived in beirut from damascus the 
syrian capital to seek ways to end the bloodshed as the leaders of 
hezbollah and the syrianbacked shiite amal militia until recently 
at each others throats gathered in tyre 
an eightmember delegation from the european economic community 
left paris today for beirut to evaluate the emergency aid needs of 
the lebanese population the french foreign ministry announced 
the french government apparently seeking to defuse the 
threatened confrontation with syrias militia allies announced 
wednesday it was trimming the task force from eight to six warships 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said the cutback was 
because the fighting has eased in the last few days but the 
decision came amid mounting moslem threats to fire on the vessels 
and kill us hostages if the french intervene 
chevenement said on french radio today that the dispatch of 
french warships off the coast of lebanon was ordered last week 
when we could expect the worst namely an assault on beirut 
lebanese military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said some french vessels were cruising 40 miles offshore distant 
from commercial shipping lanes awaiting other units en route from 
france 
their number was not known but chevenement confirmed the 
aircraft carrier foch carrying 2000 troops was in the eastern 
mediterranean 
the frigate estienne dorves one of the two ships chevenement 
said were being pulled back was anchored at larnaca cyprus 100 
miles northwest of lebanon and was expected to remain there 
druse leader walid jumblatt whose progressive socialist party is 
fighting alongside the syrians asked algerian president chadli 
bendjedid to persuade france to withdraw its flotilla and prevent 
any act of piracy against the arab people of lebanon 
the party said jumblatt told bendjedid that moslem and leftist 
forces will confront the new crusaders war whatever the cost 
the syriansponsored nationalist front the umbrella group for 
the progressive socialist party and 10 other militias said 
wednesday the french mission was an aggression and threatened to 
shell any french ship that approached lebanons 130mile coastline 
police said two unidentified war planes flew an apparent 
reconnaissance mission at high altitude over beirut and the 
confrontation lines in the mountains southeast of the capital 
thursday 
they were definitely not israeli planes said a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified under standing regulations 
tarasov head of the soviet foreign ministrys middle east 
department met acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a 
syrianbacked moslem cabinet vying for power with aouns christian 
government 
the envoy was to meet parliament speaker hussein husseini a 
shiite moslem later before crossing beiruts dividing green line 
for talks with aoun and other christian leaders 
tarasov discussed the lebanese crisis in damascus wednesday with 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
aoun 54 has declared a war of liberation against the 40000 
syrian troops deployed in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
the ustrained general charges the syrians have abrogated that 
mandate by openly siding with the moslems

exxon corp has won limited state and 
federal permission to use a controversial chemical to remove crude 
oil from shorelines coated by the nations largest oil spill 
authorities gave permission wednesday for exxon to use corexit 
9580 on smith island heavily oiled when the tanker exxon valdez hit 
a reef in prince william sound on march 24 and spilled nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil about 35 miles of the islands shore 
remain heavily oiled 
were giving them the opportunity to show they can use corexit 
effectively said steve provant a us environmental protection 
agency official on loan to the state 
provant said alaska officials believe the solvent poses some 
toxicological risk but said the gamble may be balanced by the 
stepped up removal of oil from shorelines exxons use of the 
chemical will be monitored closely by state and federal agencies 
before expanded application will be allowed he said 
the solvent is designed to soften and dissolve weathered oil 
lifting it off rocks exxon said corexit 9580 one in a line of a 
products put out by exxon chemical for use in battling oil spills 
has low toxicity and is biodegradable very little of the substance 
will remain in the water the company said 
i feel that corexit is no more toxic than the oil were washing 
off said hans jahn an exxon arctic resarch scientist who headed 
the field testing of corexit i see no disadvantages only 
advantages we can wash beaches faster 
the kerosenebased solvent has been reformulated since 
disappointing tests earlier this year 
the company plans to spray the 10agallon liquid on oiled 
shores and let it stand for about 15 minutes the oil and chemical 
then are to be washed off shore and collected by skimmers and 
absorbent booms next the areas will be treated with fertilizer to 
stimulate growth of microbes that feed on remaining hydrocarbons 
exxon officials said the company has 1000 55gallon barrels of 
the solvent in valdez and expects to need only part of that 
more than 800 miles of shoreline along prince william sound and

researchers have discovered and isolated the gene 
that causes cystic fibrosis when it is defective a major step that 
could help in developing treatments for the fatal disease a 
scientist said today 
analysis suggests the gene plays a role in transporting 
substances across cell membranes a process scientists suspect lies 
at the heart of cystic fibrosis said lapchee tsui of the research 
institute at the hospital for sick children in toronto 
the discovery will open up the door to more focused 
experiments to find treatments that strike at the basic cause of 
the disease he said in a telephone inteview 
this is one of the most significant discoveries in the history 
of human genetics said dr ronald worton chief geneticist at 
hospital for sick children 
for cystic fibrosis the finding is the most exciting event 
since this disease was first described in the medical literature 50 
years ago robert beall executive vice president of the cystic 
fibrosis foundation in bethesda md declared today 
cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of 
young people in north america some 30000 americans have it and 
1000 to 1200 new cases are diagnosed each year 
half of cystic fibrosis patients die before reaching their 
mid20s mostly from respiratory complications treatment now is 
limited to fighting the effects of the disease rather than the cause 
of the illness itself 
apart from cystic fibrosis patients some 12 million americans 
carry a defective form of the gene but do not suffer the disease 
because they also have a normal version the disease appears only in 
people who have inherited a defective form of the gene from each 
parent 
the new work will help in detecting people who carry a single 
defective version of the gene and could pass it on to their 
offspring tsui said 
the disease makes the body produce abnormally thick stick mucus 
that clogs the lungs and digestive system interfering with 
breathing and digestion scientists believe the problem stems from a 
defect in transporting of tiny charged particles across cell walls 
in the new work researchers found that the protein produced by 
the gene bears a structural resemblance to proteins that are known 
to play a role in transport across cell walls 
the new research will be reported in the journal science by a 
team of more than two dozen scientists led by tsui jack riordan of 
the research institute and francis collins of the howard hughes 
medical institute and the university of michigan at ann arbor 
scientists say they will now focus on how the gene functions and 
how the defect can be rectified

the defense reluctantly rested its case in the 
marathon mcmartin preschool molestation trial now in its third 
year after questioning a man whose child prompted investigation of 
the school six years ago 
the attorneys for raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin 
buckey ended their presentation wednesday after 10 months of 
testimony from more than 40 witnesses 
on behalf of mr buckey we will rest our case in chief 
attorney danny davis announced after the witness left the stand 
on behalf of mrs buckey we rest said attorney dean gits 
the lawyers repeatedly proposed more witnesses during the course 
of the trial but superior judge william pounders refused their 
requests citing the need to bring the proceedings to a conclusion 
pounders has vowed to have jury deliberations begin by dec 1 
after the defense rested the prosecution began presenting rebuttal 
evidence 
buckey 30 and his mother 62 are charged with 64 counts of 
molestation and a combined count of conspiracy they are the only 
defendants left in a case that began five years ago with seven 
teachers charged the district attorneys office dismissed 
accusations against five teachers after an 18month preliminary 
hearing saying there was insufficient evidence to convict them 
both defendants testified during the defense case and adamantly 
denied that they molested any children 
the last witness to take the stand the father of the boy whose 
allegations prompted the case denied molesting his own child the 
boy who was 2 when he attended the preschool never testified 
the defense had asserted that the child was molested at home 
early in the case but retracted the statement this week davis says 
he now believes the child was not molested by anyone 
the prosecution spent 14 months presenting testimony from 61 
witnesses during the trial which has set records for length and for 
cost which has been estimated at 15 million 
jurors have dropped out because of illness or job problems and 
only one alternate now remains in addition to the 12 regular jurors 
the judge has voiced concern that loss of two more jurors would 
create a mistrial and he has urged all lawyers to speed

hotel magnate leona helmsley was so paranoid 
about being overcharged and so nasty to her employees that they 
schemed to bill her personal expenses to her businesses without her 
knowing her lawyer says 
this system was in no way designed to cheat the internal 
revenue service the attorney gerald feffer said in closing 
arguments wednesday to the jury in mrs helmsleys criminal tax 
evasion trial 
mrs helmsley 69 is accused of evading 12 million in federal 
taxes by charging personal expenses including renovations at her 
connecticut estate to her businesses her husband harry also was 
charged but was separated from the trial because of deteriorating 
mental capacity 
former aides frank turco and joseph licari are codefendants at 
the trial charged with assisting in the scheme their lawyers 
planned to present closing statements today 
feffer said mrs helmsley had nothing to do with the phony bills 
he said the helmsleys had legitimately charged their 5 billion 
real estate and hotel empire for half the cost of renovating and 
operating their 11 million connecticut estate because they used it 
for business 
the problems began when mrs helmsley refused to pay contractors 
hired to work on the mansion dunnellen hall he said 
it is clear from the evidence that mrs helmsley believes she 
was being ripped off that she was absolutely paranoid that she was 
being overcharged feffer said 
her employees designed a system to pay the bills and yet at the 
same time minimize the hassle and problems of dealing with mrs 
helmsley he said 
theres no question that mrs helmsley was a very tough person 
to deal with feffer said 
assistant us attorney cathy seibel painted a different picture 
of the helmsley finances during 198385 
seibel said mrs helmsley intentionally evaded more than 1 
million in taxes by charging personal expenses to her businesses 
because she was cheap and arrogant 
if theres one thing you learned at this trial its that just 
because youre rich doesnt mean youre not cheap seibel told the 
jury the helmsleys kept an eagle eye on every penny 
seibel brought up testimony from mrs helmsleys former 
housekeeper that mrs helmsley once told her we dont pay taxes 
only the little people pay taxes

lawmakers today elected solidarity activist 
tadeusz mazowiecki as the east blocs first noncommunist prime 
minister handing him a historic mandate to lead poland out of 
economic ruin 
mazowiecki a former political prisoner was approved by a 3784 
vote in the sejm the lower house of the national assembly there 
were 41 abstentions 
members of every party including the communists supported 
mazowiecki 
the vote was greeted by a standing ovation and mazowiecki 
immediately rose to say i am very touched at this moment i thank 
you high chamber for this great proof of trust 
i am counting on cooperation with the sejm and senate this 
moment shall become an essential moment in order for us to raise up 
poland together 
lech walesa the solidarity leader said i will do everything 
so that my premier my child our child passes the test before 
society 
speaking to reporters in gdansk walesa called the election an 
event without precedent and wished mazowiecki luck in 
transforming our country from a totalitarian system to democracy 
the sejm alone elects the premier thirtyseven members of the 
460member chamber were absent for the vote 
after mazowieckis election 15 communist lawmakers submitted a 
proposal to drop from the constitution a clause that mandates the 
communist party be the leading political force in society 
deputy jozef bogusz told the state pap news agency that the 
proposed amendment was in connection with the new political 
situation and historical moment there was no indication when 
the proposal would be put to a vote 
mazowiecki had been recommended for the office of prime minister 
by walesa and nominated on saturday by communist president wojciech 
jaruzelski who accepted walesas onceinconceivable proposition to 
form a noncommunist government in the soviet unions largest and 
most strategic east bloc ally 
jaruzelski did not attend the sejm session but mazowiecki went 
to belvedere palace for a 30minute meeting with jaruzelski after 
the vote the state pap news agency said 
no details of the meeting were disclosed but at a news 
conference later mazowiecki said his initial contacts with the 
president led him to expect full respect 
in moscow a soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
greeted the election with equanimity 
the soviet side takes the decision into account and we shall 
regard comrade mazowiecki as our partner in the relations that link 
our two countries he said 
president bush praised mazowieckis election we wish him well 
of course bush said in maine its a fascinating period in 
eastern europe 
jaruzelski agreed to nominate mazowiecki after solidarity earlier 
refused to participate in a government formed by the communists 
following parliamentary elections in june 
walesa argued that because solidarity won the elections 
overwhelmingly it had a mandate to form a government that would win 
public confidence 
in an initial act of support for a solidarityled government

in the silesia region and one at a trucking enterprise in katowice

low worker productivity and a 39 billion foreign debt 
mazowiecki said wednesday he planned to present a government 
within a week he said he could not say how many of the 19 
government ministries would be offered the communists or to 
solidarity and its allied parties 
mazowiecki is under pressure from the communists and the soviet 
union to keep substantial communist representation in the 
government the communist party has demanded a full partnership role 
solidarity already has promised the communists will continue to 
head the defense and interior ministries which control the military 
and the police and that polands place in the warsaw pact military 
alliance is secure 
mazowieckis representative in talks with the communists 
jaroslaw kaczynski said wednesday night that the real negotiations 
would begin after mazowieckis election 
after the vote today in the sejm mazowiecki shook hands with 
members of the outgoing government and embraced and kissed the 
leaders of the parliamentary coalition that supported him 
mazowiecki succeeds prime minister czeslaw kiszczak who asked 
last week to be relieved of the task of trying to form a 
communistled grand coalition government 
the sejm accepted gen kiszczaks resignation without objection 
today as it began its session and warmly applauded him for his 
failed attempt to assemble a cabinet 
before the vote mazowiecki said he hopes to create a government 
of all poles 
i want to form a government capable of acting for the good of 
society the nation and the state it will be a government of a 
coalition for a thorough reform of the state mazowiecki said in a 
speech to the sejm 
the principle of struggle must be replaced with the 
principle of partnership we will not pass from a totalitarian 
system to a democratic one in any other way 
one has to restore to poland the mechanism of normal political 
life said the 62yearold adviser to walesa trained as a lawyer 
who has close ties to the countrys powerful roman catholic church 
until last week he was editor of solidaritys union weekly 
tygodnik solidarnosc

to the will of the nation and interests of the countrysaid

cincinnati reds manager pete rose baseballs 
alltime hit leader and holder of 19 majorleague records was 
banned for life today for betting on his own team a charge he 
continued to deny 
under the rules of baseball rose can appeal for reinstatement 
after one year but baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti said 
there is absolutely no deal for reinstatement that is exactly 
what we did not agree to in terms of fixed number of years 
the suspension today ended six months of allegations involving 
one of the greatest players in the history of the game 
in the absence of a hearing and in absence of evidence to the 
contrary yes i have concluded that he bet on baseball 
giamatti said today at a news conference announcing the suspension 
which is effective immediately 
asked directly if he concluded that rose bet on his own team 
giamatti said yes 
at a news conference in cincinnati rose continued to deny the 
charges against him despite what the commissioner said today i 
didnt bet on baseball he said 
but he admitted that he bet on other sports i made some 
mistakes and im being punished for mistakes he said 
as you can imagine this is a very sad day rose said ive 
been in baseball three decades and to think im gonna be out of 
baseball for a very short period of time hurts 
he called the settlement fair and said he regretted only that i 
wont have the opportunity to tell my side of the story rose also 
agreed to drop his federal lawsuit against giamatti 
the agreement announced in a statement from the commissioners 
office said that rose neither denies nor admits that he bet on any 
major league baseball game but rose acknowledges that the 
commissioner has a factual basis to impose the penalty provided 
the banishment for life of pete rose from baseball is the sad 
end of a sorry episode giamatti said in the statement one of 
the games greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which 
have stained the game and he must now live with the consequences of 
those acts 
there had not been such grave allegations since the time of 
landis the statement said in a reference to kenesaw mountain 
landis the commissioner who suspended for life the chicago white 
sox players involved in the black sox scandal after the 1919 world 
series 
there was no mention in the agreement which was signed wednesday 
by giamatti and rose that the manager would undergo counseling for 
gambling there was also no mention of whether the suspension would 
keep rose from being inducted into the baseball hall of fame 
giamatti said of counseling or gambling rehabilitation we have 
not required it it seems to be entirely in mr roses hands 
rose said he didnt consider it necessary because i dont think 
i have a gambling problem at all 
rose became the 15th person banned for life in baseball history 
and the first since 1943 no one banned for life ever has been 
reinstated 
rose agreed to a stipulation dismissing his lawsuit against 
giamatti in federal court in ohio 
rose headed off suspension by suing giamatti in state court in 
cincinnati on june 19 claiming the firstyear commissioner had 
prejudged the case six days later a judge blocked giamatti from 
holding a hearing on the gambling allegations 
john dowd a special investigator gave giamatti a 225page 
report on may 9 outlining the evidence on roses gambling it 
included telephone and bank records betting sheets allegedly in his 
handwriting and the testimony of paul janszen and ronald peters 
former associates of rose who have been convicted of federal 
felonies 
several sources said roses legal team felt a need to settle the 
case after us district judge john d holschuh ruled july 31 in 
columbus ohio that the federal courts had jurisdiction rather than 
the state judge rose faced a federal court hearing monday on his 
challenge to giamatti 
rose 48 denied having bet on baseball when he was first 
summoned on gambling charges by thencommissioner peter ueberroth on 
feb 20 three days later baseball hired dowd and began the 
investigation which cost about 1 million 
over the months the charges multiplied janszen said rose had an 
associate tommy gioiosa claim the winnings from a 47646 
parimutuel ticket at a horseracing track in 1987 and that gioiosa 
gave the money back to rose 
gioiosa has been indicted for his alleged participation and jury 
selection in his trial was scheduled to begin today in cincinnati 
rose who denied involvement is under investigation by a federal 
grand jury in cincinnati for this and other income tax matters

civic leaders in south africas 
largest black township are trying to mobilize a grassroots 
anticrime campaign saying police have responded halfheartedly to a 
surge in murders and gangrapes 
soweto home to about 25 million blacks on the outskirts of 
johannesburg has had a high crime rate for years but a sense of 
crisis has developed in recent weeks because of a wave of brazen 
crimes by gangs of young men known as the jack rollers 
the gangs which take their name from the lyrics of a popular 
song cruise sowetos streets in their cars robbing other motorists 
and abducting women 
a boyfriend of one rape victim was murdered a few days ago and 
newspapers have reported incidents where teenage girls were 
abducted at gunpoint from their classrooms while teachers looked on 
helplessly 
last weekend the south african council of churches best known 
for its antiapartheid activism sponsored a conference at a soweto 
community center to discuss ways of combatting crime 
the conference took place during a 48hour span in which 24 
murders 13 rapes and 55 robberies were reported in soweto 
participants at the conference resolved to establish youth 
centers convey warnings to gang leaders and revive neighborhood 
street committees that proliferated in 198486 before police 
broke them up 
the government depicted the street committees as vigilante groups 
led by radicals but proponents said the committees helped reduce 
crime as part of an effort to mobilize antiapartheid activity on a 
local level 
the rev frank chikane secretarygeneral of the church council 
said the surge of gang activity is clearly a result of the 
breakdown of community structures by state repression and the 
inherent inability and apparent reluctance of the state to deal with 
the situation 
other activists say the problem stems partly from restrictions on 
black high school enrollment they say many youths who were refused 
readmission to school in january after failing examinations have 
turned to crime out of frustration 
a police spokesman maj noel hartwell said efforts to arrest 
the gangsters have been hampered by lack of public cooperation 
we cannot act on theories he said people must come 
forward and report these things 
but dr nthato motlana a prominent soweto civic leader said at 
the weekend conference that the community mistrusts police officers 
and question their priorities 
when called to attend to a rape incident for instance they 
say there are no vans motlana said but when people are said to 
be terrorists 10 vans will rush to the scene immediately 
police are not the only scapegoats the national institute for 
crime and prevention a private crime prevention organization says 
sowetos problems stem not only from inadequate police protection 
but also from unemployment poverty drug and alcohol abuse and a 
breakdown of family life 
the countrys largest daily newspaper the star of johannesburg 
this week endorsed the call for a revival of street committees 
saying this would be an immediate practical step to combat crime 
but the stars editorial said crime would persist as long as 
sowetans remained impoverished and disenfranchised 
ultimately a lasting solution must be sought in political 
change it said

us officials scrambled today to determine how 
to react to a rash of bombings in colombia by drug traffickers who 
declared war on their government in retaliation for a crackdown on 
the drug trade 
everyones rushing around trying to figure out how to 
respond said a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
president bush said he had no real comment on the situation 
in colombia 
there will be meetings with the proper colombian officials in 
the not so many hours bush said at the summer white house in 
kennebunkport maine as he prepared to meet the visiting prime 
minister of denmark 
the situation concerning the one man in colombian custody whom 
the united states wants to extradite accused moneylaunderer 
eduardo martinez romero was unclear 
a us government plane has been at the bogota airport since last 
weekend and could be used to transport martinez to the united states 
for trial on the charges filed in atlanta in march according to an 
administration source 
however the source said the extradition paperwork was still 
being done and that he didnt know if martinez could be whisked out 
of colombia 
bill dempsey a spokesman for the marshals service that 
customarily handles the transport of people being extradited said 
today were ready to move martinez were standing by for any 
order from the department of justice but we have no further 
instructions at this point 
a defense department source said the pentagon had received no 
immediate orders either to help evacuate us personnel in colombia 
or to send them help 
bush had said wednesday that us troops would not be dispatched 
because colombian president virgilio barco specifically had rejected 
that option 
state department spokesman richard boucher said wednesday that 
us diplomats in colombia and other latin american countries where 
the cartel has staged successful terrorist attacks have been 
operating on a heightened state of alert as a result of the 
crackdown 
i would say that our people in colombia and in other places 
where threat exists have always been on a high state of 
readiness or care in their security procedures that 
continues he said 
drug enforcement administration spokesman frank shults said today 
there were no immediate plans to evacuate the two dozen dea agents 
stationed in colombia nor their families in the past agents have 
been removed from areas of other countries including mexico and 
peru when tensions increased 
however there is a heightened sense of the need for security 
in colombia based on actions down there today shults said the 
department of state is the primary agency responsible for the 
security of american personnel overseas and we will be meeting with 
state department officials to assess this situation 
in colombia today drug traffickers bombed the headquarters of 
two political parties killing one person and set fire to two 
politicians homes in medellin the base for the worlds biggest 
cocaine cartel in addition officials said they defused powerful 
bombs found in suitcases left at the medellin offices of two 
national radio networks 
at one of the stations the bombers left behind a communique 
dated wednesday and signed by the extraditables a group known 
to carry out bloody acts for the medellin drug cartel 
we declare total and absolute war on the government on the 
industrial and political oligarchy on the journalists that have 
attacked and ravaged us on the judges that have sold out to the 
government on the extraditing magistrates on the presidents of the 
unions and all those who who persecuted and attacked us it said 
we wont respect the families of those who have not respected 
our families we will burn and destroy the industries the 
properties and the mansions of the oligarchies it said 
colombian justice minister monica de greiff had been scheduled to 
fly to washington to discuss procedures for extraditing those drug 
traffickers wanted in the united states however it was unclear 
when or even if she would make that trip in light of the violence 
in her country said an administration source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
thus far none of the top leadership of the medellin and cali 
cartels has been arrested martinez is considered one of the major 
finanial people for medellin but not the chief of its 
moneylaundering operation 
drug traffickers death squads have hit hard in colombia and 
neighboring venezuela but fbi spokesman mike kortan said we have 
not attributed any terrorist act to them in the united states 
meanwhile ms de greiff was quoted in the washington post today 
as saying that if us financial aid is to have any impact on her 
countrys drug war it should come as soon as possible and without 
any strings attached she said her country had not received any of 
5 million in us aid announced in april because of wrangling over 
how the money is to be spent 
the justice department announced that colombia will be offered a 
2 million program to help protect its judges and others threatened 
by terrorist attacks the agreement was signed wednesday 
at the state department boucher said there would be other 
meetings this week with senior colombian officials but he declined 
to say when where or who would be involved were trying to avoid 
too much focus on specific meetings and individuals because of the 
security situation he said 
the joint effort between the united states and colombia began 
when barco imposed a state of siege after fridays assassination of 
luis carlos galan a leading presidential candidate and outspoken 
foe of drug traffickers 
the emergency measures have resulted in the arrests of some 
11000 people and allowed the immediate resumption of extraditions 
to the united states the colombian supreme court under attack from 
drug traffickers threw out the extradition law in 1987 
the justice department this week issued its most wanted list 
of 12 alleged drug cartel leaders but none has been arrested 
us officials say the medellin cartel supplies an estimated 80 
percent of the cocaine sold illegally in the united states

americas elderly will live increasingly alone 
and with greater health limitations in the 21st century researchers 
say in a report highlighting the need for alternative services to 
help older people avoid nursing homes 
the private urban institute in a study projecting the 
characteristics of older americans into the next century said at 
least 30 million elderly people are expected to be living alone in 
2030 compared with 84 million in 1984 
the number of elderly without a significant caregiver is 
growing because of fewer marriages fewer children and more 
divorces the report said 
and if current rates of disability persist the number of elderly 
requiring institutional care will more than triple from 13 million 
in 1984 to 53 million in 2030 it said 
the expectation is that there will be a surge in the demand for 
supportive services that will allow the elderly to live in their 
communities for a longer period of time the report said 
aside from the sheer increase in the number of elderly persons 
a much larger proportion of the elderly is likely to be living alone 
and a larger proportion is likely to have some level of health 
dependency it said 
the research team led by sheila r zedlewski called for more 
research to prevent disability better services such as home care 
more housing modification programs and a revised financing system 
to make proper care more affordable 
while an increase in the need for nursing home care is 
inevitable the increase could be reduced if successful policies 
aimed at reducing disability rates among the elderly are adopted 
the report said 
further reductions in institutionalization rates could be made 
if formal inhome services or alternative care arrangements were 
more broadly available to the elderly it said 
the study the needs of the elderly in the 21st century said 
more healthcare dollars should be devoted to research that could 
prevent or postpone disabling diseases of aging of 145 billion 
spent on health care for the elderly in the united states in 1988 
less than half of 1 percent was invested in research it said 
the report also said the patchwork of federal state and private 
programs to help the elderly often makes it difficult for older 
people to qualify for the help they need resulting in inappropriate 
institutionalization 
it may sadly and ironically be the case that entry into a 
nursing home may be the solution to what is basically a housing 
rather than a health problem it said similarly entering a 
nursing home may emerge as a solution to the elderly persons 
inability to manage a household 
the researchers said that while social services such as 
homedelivered meals homemaker assistance visiting nurses and 
adult day care can delay or prevent institutionalization most are 
not covered either by the government or private insurance 
these services should be coordinated with housing programs that 
allow for modifications such as ramps grab bars and special kitchen 
hardware to help older people function in their homes the report 
said

in a borrowed office beside a watercolor 
no one bothered to hang nick daniloff is engaged in international 
diplomacy 
behind the scenes in government is an unusual spot for the former 
us news and world report correspondent who gained notoriety three 
years ago after being imprisoned on trumpedup espionage charges 
but now hes vermonts man on the soviet union spending his 
summer months arranging the visits of a delegation of people from 
karelia the soviet province that gov madeleine kunin hopes will 
officially become vermonts sister state 
i suppose some people might look on it as being ironic 
daniloff said but its for a good purpose and thats what 
counts 
daniloff insists he never was a spy and that his imprisonment 
followed the fbis arrest of gennadiy fedorovich zakharov the 
soviet employee of the united nations allegedly sought to obtain 
classified information of the us government from an fbi informant 
at a new york city subway station 
but neither he nor state officials are concerned that the soviets 
may be unnerved when they hear daniloff is on the telephone helping 
arrange for the exchange of officials from karelia 
i have a gripe with the kgb but i dont have a gripe with the 
soviet union he said in an interview this week 
my understanding is that the folks in karelia sort of shrugged 
their shoulders and went on about their business i understand there 
was one official in the soviet embassy in washington who raised his 
eyebrows and then no more was said about it 
following the 1985 summit between former president ronald reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev personal contacts between 
individuals in the superpowers were given official sanction states 
like vermont alaska and iowa have capitalized on the relaxation of 
relations 
several independent groups in vermont have organized exchanges of 
singing students dairy farmers and journalists but the karelians 
are coming at the invitation of kunin who visited the province last 
year 
kunin said she sought daniloffs advice before going to the 
soviet union to fulfill a promise she plucked a flower from a 
bouquet at the american ambassadors residence in moscow and placed 
the carnation at the grave daniloffs great great grandfather in a 
nearby cemetery 
when planning the karelians visit to vermont state officials 
again sought daniloff who settled in vermont after his soviet 
imprisonment to write a book linking his great great grandfathers 
experience of imprisonment with his own he has a home in andover 
some people are just good for information but with nick you 
really get understanding kunins former chief of staff elizabeth 
bankowski said 
daniloff has traveled around vermont this summer speaking with 
those who might be interested in talking to the soviets during the 
visit which begins labor day 
the karelians are expected to visit a guilford dairy farmer who 
has already sent a prized holstein to the soviet union as a goodwill 
measure 
daniloff also is hopeful future educational exchanges and 
business deals can be arranged 
all of these things are built brick by brick he said

minorities stand a good chance of gaining seats 
in the house after congressional district lines are redrawn based on 
results of the 1990 census a demographic expert said thursday 
william ohare director of policy studies at the population 
reference bureau also predicted that there is going to be a 
mountain of litigation following the census over issues such as 
adjustments for undercounted minorities whether or not to exclude 
illegal aliens and inclusion of military personnel overseas in the 
count used for reapportionment 
we think that the redistricting in the 1990s offers a lot of 
opportunities and a few potential pitfalls ohare told a news 
conference clearly theres room for more election of 
minorities 
in the 199192 reapportionment ohare said the states that 
are likely to gain the most congressional seats for example 
california texas florida all have large minority populations 
he said the countrys hispanic population was expected to show a 
particularly strong gain from about 145 million in 1980 up to a 
projected 22 million in the 1990 census with most of the increase 
concentrated in sunbelt states 
asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will be 
in the house ohare said certainly half a dozen to 10 is not 
unreasonable i would say thats optimistic but not 
outlandishly optimistic 
the 435seat house now has 36 minority members 22 blacks nine 
hispanics four asianamericans and one american indian 
he said that currently blacks make up about 12 percent of the 
us population but have only 15 percent of elected officials 
while hispanics comprise 8 percent of the population but are less 
than 2 percent of elected officials across the country 
ohare released cpies of a new population reference bureau 
report redistricting in the 1990s a guide for minority groups 
that was funded by the ford foundation and includes chapters written 
by eight experts in minority demographics and politics 
the washingtonbased population reference bureau describes itself 
as a private nonpartisan organization which aims to increase 
public awareness and understanding of population issues

the minister who now heads the church that 
jim bakker founded as the cornerstone of his ptl empire said there 
was no irony intended in the parable he chose as the topic for his 
midweek sermon 
the rev sam johnson chose the parable that says it is easier for 
a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to 
get into heaven 
bakker a bible school classmate and johnsons former boss goes 
on trial monday on charges of fraud and conspiracy prosecutors say 
he and other ptl executives diverted 4 million given to the 
ministry to support luxurious lifestyles 
what jesus tells us in this parable is that its not the amount 
of work thats done but the attitude in which the work is done 
thats important johnson told about 150 worshipers wednesday 
night at heritage church in a sermon before the telecast of his 
cable evangelical show 
when johnson was asked whether he had bakker in mind he replied 
i did not choose that parable tonight because of the timing but 
the timing sometimes is of god 
bakker built heritage church as part of heritage usa a 
ptlmanaged enterprise that grew over the course of a decade into a 
2300acre christian resort broadcasting complex and theme park 
but bakker was forced to leave ptl ministries in 1987 after a sexual 
scandal and ptl is now in bankruptcy court heritage usa and other 
ptl assets have been bought by a toronto businessman 
heritage church and its parent heritage ministries which runs 
the daily cable program shown on the inspirational network were 
severed from ptl in bankruptcy proceedings last year 
johnson and bakker attended bible school together in minneapolis 
30 years ago and johnson later worked at ptl as an executive 
responsible for world missions but johnson quit in a dispute with 
bakker over funding for the mission programs he returned to 
heritage church after bakker resigned from ptl 
in june johnson and his congregation left the grounds of 
heritage usa for a new church on interstate 77 in a charlotte 
neighborhood of small older homes the new facility comprises three 
cast concrete buildings 
on wednesday night the sanctuary smelled of the new carpet that 
had been installed on the platform a piano and small combo provided 
music and a wall with recessed blue arches provided a backdrop for 
tv cameras 
thirty minutes after the prayer service ended the soft lights 
that lit the heritage church sanctuary were engulfed by bright tv 
spotlights for the broadcast of the oldtime camp meeting hour 
a nightly onehour show sent to cable systems around the country 
the congregation including many who had been bused 10 miles from 
heritage usa gathered in the center section of the sanctuary a 
former gymnasium to be part of the show 
wednesday nights guest speaker was the rev charles crank the 
district superintendent of indiana for the assemblies of god the 
denomination that defrocked bakker in march 1987 viewers got only 
part of his 50minute sermon because an electrical storm knocked the 
ministry off the air for the first halfhour 
heritage ministries normally broadcasts an hour each night but 
it bought a second hour of satellite time wednesday night to ask for 
donations 
television viewers johnson said later have become skeptical of 
preachers crying for money over the airwaves in the wake of the many 
recent evangelical scandals 
but we have no alternative he said

brigitte bardot on thursday denounced frances 
national medical research institute for refusing to sell her 29 
animals stolen from its laboratories and later recovered 
human survival is very important but not at the price of 
sacrifices and martyrdom done legally with good conscience by 
researchers on animals which endure tortures worse than the ss made 
men endure during the war the former actress said on french radio 
the national institute for health and medical research in a 
statement said the offer to buy 28 monkeys and one cat was 
pointless because other animals would have to be purchased in their 
place for experiments 
miss bardot who in recent years has devoted her life to animal 
protection said she was disappointed but not surprised 
the animal rights group noahs ark claimed responsibility for 
taking the monkeys and cat from the laboratory last may the animals 
were found the following month in a home in southern france

drug use by military recruits apparently dropped 
by half in the first months of mandatory drugtesting of armed 
forces applicants military and health officials said thursday 
subsequent testing of some 6000 urine samples collected from 
random recruits in march and april 1988 showed that 73 percent had 
recently used marijuana 18 percent had used cocaine and 07 were 
positive for both according to a report from the office of the army 
surgeon general published in thursdays weekly report of the 
centers for disease control 
those numbers were roughly twice the results of the first seven 
months of the defense departments new applicant testing program of 
more than 320000 recruits tested from junedecember 1988 24 
percent were positive for marijuana 09 percent were positive for 
cocaine and 03 percent were positive for both 
the applicants who provided urine samples in the marchapril 
pilot study were not told they would be drugtested but the samples 
were not personally identified and the results could not be linked 
to individuals the cdc report said 
positive specimens from those pilot tests were not confirmed 
data from other military drug tests indicates that 85 percent to 90 
percent of the positive samples would have been confirmed on repeat 
testing the report said 
the defense department has screened all applicants for military 
service since june 1988 under an act of congress the testing 
program is the largest nonrandom drugtesting program in the 
united states the cdc said 
early findings from the program were released in january some 
defense officials said privately at the time that while the program 
had blocked more than 11000 apparent drugusing recruits in its 
first seven months it was not worth its multimilliondollar cost

voyager 2 discovered two more moons 
around neptune today and for the first time photographed high 
bright clouds so clearly that the clouds shadows could be seen on a 
lower layer of haze 
the two new moons bring neptunes total to eight including the 
two moons observed from earth triton and nereid and four 
previously found by voyager 
photographs returned from neptune showed dramatic and puzzling 
details in the clouds over the great dark spot an earthsized 
cyclone that is neptunes most prominent feature said bradford 
smith leader of the imaging team 
theres something about that dark spot smith said the 
clouds appear to be stationary even though the winds are moving very 
strongly through this area 
the cloud shadows voyager photographed came from similar high 
white cirruslike clouds at another spot on neptune this is the 
first time voyager has ever been able to see cloud shadows on any of 
the planets weve looked at smith said 
the positions of the shadows allowed scientists to calculate that 
the high clouds were about 30 miles above the lower layer of haze 
smith said 
as voyager 2 began its final approach to neptune it showed that 
the planets strange moon triton is a bright pink red and blue 
marble ringed by what could be a snowcovered glacier of frozen 
natural gas scientists say 
scientists also received confirmation that final instructions to 
control the spacecrafts cameras and sensors had been received said 
douglas griffith deputy mission director 
we know its in there now and were safe he said 
at 9 am pdt today voyager was 472056 miles from neptune 
caught in the grip of neptunes powerful gravity and falling toward 
the fourthlargest planet at a speed of 38599 mph 
at 856 pm pdt voyager will pass 3042 miles from neptunes 
cloud tops closer than it has come to any other celestial object on 
its 44 billionmile journey from earth 
researchers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory planned an 
allnight vigil as the most detailed images begin coming back from 
the spacecraft early friday morning it takes 4 hours and six 
minutes for radio signals from the spacecraft to reach earth 
two days of tracking the spacecraft showed that a difficult 
course correction monday had put voyager smack dab in the middle 
of the path navigators wanted it to follow said norman haynes 
voyager project manager 
the spacecraft launched in 1977 will reach a speed of 61148 
mph as it sweeps around neptune headed for a pass 23888 miles from 
triton at 214 am pdt friday 
tritons equator is encircled with what appears to be a slightly 
blue band of fresh snow or frost probably made of frozen natural 
gas or methane said robert brown of the voyager imaging team 
if you were standing there youd see crystals of frost growing 
much as you see frost growing on a window in the winter time 
brown said in an interview 
its going to look glacial like a glacier with a thin layer of 
snow on it he said 
the band may be white or may be slightly blue said bradford 
smith head of the imaging team if it is indeed blue its the 
only thing weve seen blue on any satellite since we launched 
voyager he said 
the band borders a darker reddish area in tritons northern 
hemisphere which itself is still as bright as dirty snow brown 
said it looks dark only because the rest of the planet is so 
bright he said 
the darker region could consist of frozen methane darkened by 
bombardment with energetic subatomic particles from space 
researchers said much of the moons southern hemisphere appears 
pink 
researchers reported the first possibility of a meteorite crater 
on triton i saw a circular feature said smith certainly an 
impact crater is a possibility he said confirmation will await 
more detailed images he said 
the pictures have convinced scientists that triton is 
unobstructed by clouds 
almost certainly were seeing the surface smith said that 
suggests some real excitement here friday morning and again on 
saturday when the most detailed photographs reach earth 
friday morning vice president dan quayle head of the 
policymaking national space council will visit the jet propulsion 
laboratory for a briefing on space activities he will also meet 
with reporters 
among voyagers findings was the aug 11 discovery of what first 
appeared to be a partial ring around neptune scientists say 
photographs indicate that it probably is a complete second ring 
around neptune 
probably its a ring said smith but its a ring like 
weve never seen before 
researchers also expect to find at least two new moons near 
neptune beyond the two previously known and the four already 
discovered by voyager smith said

federal grand jury investigating a drug moneylaundering scheme he 
is to be sentenced monday 
swindall was indicted in that case last october and tried to go 
to trial immediately in an effort to clear his name before the nov 
8 election when he faced a strong opponent 
a jury was selected but was never sworn in because us district 
judge robert vining ended the proceedings due to swindall campaign

a letter from a polygraph examiner who said swindall did not lie 
when asked about his knowledge of the alleged drug money operation 
the mailing was sent the day after vining told swindall a lawyer 
representing himself that he could not mention the polygraph test 
in the trial four of the 14 people selected as jurors and 
alternates lived in swindalls district where the brochure was 
mailed 
swindall ended up losing the nov 8 election to actor ben jones

speeches by deng xiaoping were splashed across the 
front pages of major chinese newspapers thursday as the official 
media intensified their new adulatory treatment of the aging senior 
leader 
three different speeches by deng all given decades ago filled 
the top half of the front pages of several national newspapers 
rarely have old speeches been reprinted and so prominently displayed 
but dengs prominence in the official media has grown 
substantially since he ordered the military to crack down on june 
34 on the mass prodemocracy movement in beijing troops killed 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people 
deng 85 has not been seen in public since june 9 when he 
addressed martial law troops in beijing he is reported to be ill 
with cancer 
the press has quoted him regularly and released several of his 
early essays a book of reminiscences about his early career has 
come out and a major movie has been made about his role in leading a 
communist uprising in 1929 the china art gallery displays a bronze 
bust of him 
the three speeches that were published thursday are among 39 
contained in a new volume of his selected works that was released 
this week 
the guangming daily published for intellectuals carried a 
speech given in 1950 less than a year after the communists came to 
power in china 
in it deng spoke to journalists about the importance of their 
work emphasizing their responsibility to educate the masses in 
political ideology and carry out party policy 
the economic daily and the workers daily published a speech deng 
made four years later to a group of party officials about the need 
for the party to turn its focus from revolution to construction 
a 1961 speech to members of the communist youth league the 
partys youth branch about the leagues responsibilities was

a judge has ruled that a lawsuit may go to 
trial to determine if any subliminal messages on a heavy metal judas 
priest album led to a suicide pact between two reno youths 
washoe district judge jerry whitehead ruled wednesday that 
subliminal messages dont enjoy first amendment rights of freedom of 
speech because they are aimed at the subconscious 
whitehead said he found it difficult to accept that any expert 
could say the suicides were triggered by alleged subliminal messages 
on the british bands stained class album but he said the issue 
should be decided by a jury 
the court concludes it must allow the public to decide these 
important and unique issues after a full hearing and must not 
interpose its own personal opinions whitehead said 
previously in similar lawsuits filed across the country judges 
have dismissed cases after ruling that artistic messages are 
protected by the first amendment but courts have not spoken to the 
issue of subliminal messages 
the lawsuit was filed by the families of the two youths one who 
died immediately after shooting himself with a shotgun in december 
1985 and the other who died three years later of from complications 
of his injuries 
raymond belknap then 17 and james vance then 19 shot 
themselves in a school playground after sharing a 12pack of beer 
smoking marijuana and listening to stained class in belknaps 
bedroom for several hours 
in a deposition taken before he died vance said the music 
convinced them the answer to life was death 
experts hired by attorneys for the youths families have 
submitted reports claiming the subliminal message do it do it 
can be heard buried in the album recorded by cbs records in the 
1970s 
the defendants cbs records and judas priest have strongly 
denied there were any subliminal messages in the album

a poem by salman rushdie written shortly after the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said the novelist should die for writing 
the satanic verses will appear next month in a british literary 
magazine 
it will be rushdies first published literary work since the late 
iranian spiritual leader put a price on his head feb 14 for the 
satanic verses which many moslems consider blasphemous 
rushdie who has since been in hiding under police guard writes 
in the threeverse 17line poem that he has chosen not to shut 
up to sing on in spite of attacks and says he has been called 
fullofhate selfaggrandizing satan selfloathing and shrill 
the poem is to appear under copyright in granta a literary 
journal edited by bill buford an american who came to cambridge 
university in 1977 as a literature student 
buford founded granta as a platform for new writing in 1979 and 
the issue containing rushdies poem celebrates the magazines 10th 
anniversary 
the poem is called 6 march 1989 which buford said was the 
date it was written 20 days after khomeinis ruling 
buford said rushdie was among writers who contributed to the 
first issue and were invited to publish new work in the anniversary 
edition 
that invitation went out before khomeinis death sentence and 
rushdie had been expected to contribute a prose piece buford said 
but instead a typewritten poem arrived with no accompanying 
explanation of any sort 
buford who provided a copy of the poem said he had verified 
that it was indeed rushdies work 
i think it is an important heartfelt statement of a man 
feeling alone and isolated and estranged from friends public and 
audience who is under circumstances that no writer in living memory 
has had to live under buford told the associated press 
i think its moving and in its way quite profound he said 
rushdie remains in hiding with his wife novelist marianne 
wiggins khomeini died in june but the death sentence was not 
lifted and the indianborn moslem writer has published nothing 
except a brief apology for any offense caused to moslems and a few 
book reviews in the weekly observer newspaper 
granta sells about 140000 copies per issue it is distributed by 
penguin the group that published the satanic verses and the 
anniversary issue goes on sale sept 1

all but two of the 370 people 
detained during a protest on the 21st anniversary of the 1968 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia have been released a 
government spokesman said thursday 
two hungarians under investigation on charges of breaching public 
order for their alleged role in stirring up the antigovernment 
protest are the only two people still in custody the spokesman 
miroslav pavel told a news conference 
they were identified as tamas deutsch and gyoergy kerenyi two 
activists with the hungarian opposition youth group fidesz kerenyi 
addressed a crowd chanting for freedom at the start of mondays 
protest before being grabbed by plainclothes police 
according to staterun media 50 foreigners were among the 370 
people detained hundreds of helmeted riot police swarmed through 
central prague to break up the protests 
pavel did not say whether any of the 320 czechoslovaks detained 
would face charges or simply be fined for their participation in the 
banned demonstration 
diplomats in prague said eight italians and seven dutch residents 
were released and ordered to leave the country thursday 
a dutch embassy spokesman said the dutch were fined before being 
released 
seven hungarians including five cameramen and photographers 
were released wednesday and left for home the official news agency 
ctk reported 
two austrian cameramen also were freed wednesday after what 
austrian radio termed massive intervention from viennas embassy 
in prague 
a west german tv crew and an american reporter also were briefly 
detained monday as well as three poles who spent two days in 
detention the identities of the remaining foreigners were not known 
pavel said that czechoslovak authorities who blamed foreign 
provocateurs for mondays protest would continue to punish 
outsiders who violated national law 
czechoslovakia welcomes tourists but that does not free 
them from the obligation to respect czechoslovak laws he said 
czechoslovak authorities will not permit the center of town to 
become a place for all kinds of demonstrations on which cheap 
political capital would be banked at our expense 
czechoslovakias entrenched communist leadership which came to 
power after the 1968 invasion has resisted mounting pressure at 
home and from east bloc reformers to relax its monopoly on power

thomas t demery lobbied to be appointed 
secretary of housing and urban development while knowing he was 
under investigation for allegedly mishandling a federal housing 
program records released thursday show 
as assistant secretary for housing at hud for two years i have 
become greatly challenged and sensitized to the public policy 
questions surrounding the homeless the availability of lowincome 
housing and the difficulty the elderly and firsttime homebuyers 
face in finding affordable housing demery said in a form letter 
to congressmen dated dec 7 1988 
the position went to former rep jack kemp rny and demery 
has gone into private consulting but demerys conduct at hud is 
being examined as part of the probe of alleged fraud abuse and 
mismanagement at the agency during the reagan administration 
the letter was sent to sens gordon humphrey rnh donald 
riegle dmich arlen specter rpa rep carl pursell rmich 
and robert teeter then codirector of the office of presidentelect 
bush 
the letters were contained in files opened to the press thursday 
under the freedom of information act 
demery could not immediately be reached thursday a woman 
answering his telephone said demery was on vacation 
demery is a former michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker 
who worked in ronald reagans successful 1980 campaign as assistant 
housing secretary he administered several of huds biggest 
programs including 225 million in moderaterehabilitation funds 
awarded annually and the massive federal housing administrations 
mortgage insurance program 
the rehabilitation program has been revealed to be governed by 
influence peddling while the fha has been losing millions of dollars 
annually through loan defaults and mismanagement 
in particular huds inspector general was investigating in 1988 
whether demery had misused his position to induce contractors 
seeking hud business to contribute to his pet charity food for 
africa the inspector general concluded that demery may have traded 
on his position but last month the justice department said it saw 
no evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
the inspector generals investigation began in december of 1987 
and by the autumn of 1988 it was apparent that demery was among the 
targets of the probe 
in his initial interview with investigators in may demery was 
asked whether he steered hud business to a former employee of the 
department and in october he had been interviewed again this time 
in the office of his attorney where he handed over personal bank 
records 
much more extensive files of two other former hud officials 
secretary samuel r pierce jr and his top aide deborah gore dean 
have given insights into their activities at the agency in 
contrast the demery files opened thursday consisted largely of 
copies of his testimony before congress 
but a folder headed per personnel 198688 revealed a serious 
case of office infighting between demery and r hunter cushing then 
deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing programs 
cushing resigned aug 2 from the post of deputy assistant 
secretary for loan programs at the department of commerce a 
position he assumed under the bush administration a few weeks 
earlier he invoked his constitutional right against 
selfincrimination and refused to answer questions when called 
before a congressional subcommittee investigating hud 
there was no answer thursday at cushings home telephone number 
the issue remains that youve lost control of the people who 
work for you the public you serve and the industry you oversee 
demery said in a 1986 letter to cushing i believe a change must 
occur 
demery wrote in a memo after cushing missed a june 1988 staff 
meeting 
summertime attendance conflicts due to heavy social commitments 
and inconvenient flight schedules are inappropriate reasons for not 
attending staff meetings i also think your suggestions to change my 
meeting time to accommodate your social life was equally 
inappropriate

delays in the soviet mars program 
following the first public scrutiny of the space programs budget 
could affect us plans to launch a spacecraft to mars in 1992 a 
nasa scientist said thursday 
a leading soviet space official said that soviet plans to explore 
mars and ultimately send a manned mission there are being delayed by 
pressure to divert money to social programs 
the us program had been tentatively planned to mesh with the 
soviet program with us launches scheduled for 1992 and 1996 and 
soviet launches in 1994 and 1998 said john casani assistant 
director for flight projects at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
that plan is now uncertain because soviet space scientists have 
not yet received all the money they need for the socalled mars 94 
mission 
we have got funding for instruments but not for the 
spacecraft said albert galeev head of the institute of space 
research in moscow 
he was in pasadena for the second international conference on 
solar system exploration being held at the california institute of 
technology to coincide with voyager 2s close encounter with neptune 
thursday 
he said he expected the remainder of the money to be approved 
soon but the delay has already forced scientists to cut back plans 
for mars 94 galeev said 
the mission had been planned to include a rover that could move 
about the martian surface but because of delays in funding there is 
no longer time to develop and test such a rover by 1994 he said 
the mission had also been planned to include one or more helium 
balloons designed to take measurements as they drift through the 
martian atmosphere and possibly even land to study the martian 
surface at different points 
the most immediate impact on the us mars program would be if 
they decide not to go ahead with the balloon experiment said 
casani 
the mars observer the american mars mission scheduled to be 
launched in 1992 was designed to be able to communicate with the 
balloons he said 
galeev said in an interview that at the meeting of the congress 
of peoples deputies in moscow in late may and early june some 
delegates had argued that money should be diverted from the space 
and military budgets toward raising workers salaries and pensions 
in the end money was taken only from the military budget not 
from the space budget he said nevertheless approval for funding 
of space missions has slowed 
we want to keep all the programs but whether we will do it on 
a longer scale or as we had planned its difficult to say now 
galeev said 
certainly space is a lower priority than it was he said 
but certainly it is not as bad as it looked at the time of the 
congress of the peoples deputies 
up until now their program has never been subject to public 
approval said casani nor were tradeoffs made with social 
programs with glasnost these programs are going to have to 
withstand public scrutiny 
the us program is also changing now casani said as nasa 
rushes to complete a 90day report requested by president bush on 
july 20 when he proposed that the united states send manned 
missions to the moon and mars 
the soviet mars program was set back last year when two phobos 
spacecraft failed one was given an incorrect command from earth 
the reason for the failure of the other spacecraft is not known

my greatest wish is that the present coalition government could 
open to poles the possibility of lifting up the country 
economically we need efficient economic means which will give 
enterprising people a feeling of security about their activity and 
let everyone find a moral and material sense of their work 
the problem of law and rule of law is of basic importance for 45 
years the law has been treated cavalierly in poland subordinated to 
the current political aims and citizens did not have a sense of 
freedom of conscience that the law protects them and that it is the 
same for all 
it is necessary to introduce the rule of law by giving every 
citizen the rights accordant with international pacts agreements 
and conventions citizens must have a feeling of freedom security 
and coparticipation 
they can have such a feeling only in a lawabiding state in 
which every action by authorities is based on the law and through 
legislation contents and interpretation of its provisions 
correspond with the social feeling of justice 
only law aiming at the common good may enjoy respect and social 
authority we will not form an entirely new army or police what 
matters is creating legal guarantees so that everyone including 
those inside those institutions feels they serve society 
professional administration functions effectively when 
appointments are based on competence and bound by loyalty to the 
state not as currently by loyalty to particular parties 
in relations between the government and citizens the mass media 
play an irreplacable role especially radio and television today 
they must be pluralistic i consider transition from a monopoly to 
pluralism in this field indispensable 
high chamber 
i am convinced that poland can fulfill an important role in the 
political economic and cultural life of europe the countrys 
extremely difficult economic situation of the country does not bode 
optimistically in the field of international relations a gap is 
growing in the level of civilization between poland and societies of 
highly developed countries this increases poles weariness as 
expressed among other ways through emigration especially by young 
people 
polands friends should understand that one cannot wait until we 
are sinking economic reconstruction will serve not only our country 
but also the whole european commuity 
europe is one including the east as well as the west 
transformations in the soviet union arouse our lively sympathy we 
understand their significance for the political opening in our 
country as well we desire to maintain goodneighborly friendly 
relations with the soviet union 
for the first time a chance is appearing for the relationship 
between our nations to be based on friendship and cooperation 
between the societies and not just among a single party 
this is a great opportunity which cannot be wasted we understand 
the significance of obligations resulting from the warsaw pact to 
all its members i state that the government that i will form will 
respect this treaty 
high chamber 
the change in polands political situation stems from the fact 
that the new government is formed on solidaritys initiative in 
agreement with united peasants party and democratic party 
this is perceived as an extraordinary event in our political life 
the possibility that every force in parliament could form the 
government must become something completely normal 
the government i am forming does not assume responsibility for 
the legacy it inherits however that influences the circumstances in 
which we must function 
we separate ourselves from the past with a thick line we will be 
responsible only for what we have done to lift poland from the 
present state of collapse 
i am aware that for my compatriots today the most important 
question is whether it could be better 
we will all reply to this the success of the activities of the 
future government depends on whether it will be accepted and 
understood by the society 
all social and political forces represented in the parliament and 
those existing outside must define their position in the face of the 
new situation 
it poses a challenge for everyone and especially for the young 
generation which must take notice of a great opportunity to solve 
the challenges we face 
the government will not cure anything we must do it together 
poland will be different if everybody wants it

american consumers can expect mostly stable 
energy prices in the 1990s but parts of the northeast are likely to 
face a squeeze on electricity supplies early in the decade an 
industry research group said thursday 
the gas research institute sponsored by natural gas pipeline and 
distribution companies said the big increase in oil prices that 
many forecasters have projected for the mid1990s is unlikely to hit 
before the turn of the century 
a key reason for expecting a longer period of stable prices the 
group said is that oil production in highcost fields such as the 
north sea has remained strong some highcost production has been 
lost particularly in the united states but the overall decline has 
been smaller than expected after the 1986 price crash 
the groups 20year forecast also said that demand for 
electricity was likely to grow slowly but that some areas 
nonetheless would experience severe supply problems 
capacity shortfalls are now virtually unavoidable in critical 
areas such as new england the forecast said because too little 
generating capacity is being added it said the electricity crunch 
could hit new england within a few years 
even if the nations electricity use grows relatively slowly to 
the year 2000 electric utilities will have to build the rough 
equivalent to 45 new largescale power plants beyond whats now 
planned the report said 
oil prices by 1995 are likely to be about 18 a barrel in 
current dollars rising to about 20 a barrel by the year 2000 the 
group said oil currently is selling for about 18 a barrel up from 
about 15 a barrel last year 
some forecasters expect a more rapid price escalation although 
many have scaled back their projections in recent years as major oil 
producers in the middle east have continued to be saddled with more 
production capacity than the market needs 
the energy department for example has reduced its oil price 
projections but still foresees an average price of 28 a barrel in 
current dollars by the year 2000 
daniel dreyfus vice president for strategic planning and 
analysis at the gas research institute said the price of oil will 
move erratically in the 1990s but probably will not return to the 
low levels of late 1988 when it sunk to about 12 a barrel 
weve been through the lowest of oil prices he told a news 
conference 
a faster price escalation is likely after the turn of the 
century dreyfus said as world oil demand moves more into balance 
with available supplies the forecast said the price in current 
dollars would be about 32 a barrel in 2010 
low oil prices during the 1990s imply generally stable prices for 
all types of energy including natural gas coal and products made 
from oil such as gasoline the forecast said this is because oil 
is the most versatile and the dominant energy source 
the report also said us oil imports would reach 134 million 
barrels a day by 2010 nearly double the current rate and meeting 
about twothirds of total us oil needs imports will rise it 
said as domestic production continues to fall

john f kennedy jr is due for his first 
appearance before a judge since becoming an assistant district 
attorney but as a defendant not a prosecutor 
kennedy 28 has a friday date before an administrative law judge 
at the state department of motor vehicles in the borough of queens 
to answer summonses for speeding and driving an uninsured 
unregistered and uninspected vehicle agency spokesman tom apple 
said thursday 
port authority police issued the summonses july 9 after stopping 
kennedy for doing 63 mph in a 50 mph zone apple said 
kennedy pleaded guilty by mail to speeding and driving an 
uninspected car but his check was not enough to cover his 127 
fines and he did not answer the other two charges apple said 
the son of the late president could delay the hearing with a 
phone call or send his lawyer if he simply intends to plead guilty 
apple said a guilty plea on the uninsured vehicle charge would cost 
kennedy his license for one year the spokesman said 
kennedy was sworn in as a prosecutor in the manhattan district 
attorneys office monday a spokesman for district attorney robert 
morgenthau gerald mckelvey said we expect mr kennedy to handle 
this in an appropriate manner

a federal judge predicted about onefourth 
of white students would leave for private schools when he 
consolidated this river citys two racially split high schools 
but registration records show nearly as many students are 
returning to public classrooms as are leaving as the opening of 
newly desegregated schools nears officials say 
im very very optimistic superintendent melvin buckley said 
wednesday it looks like the issue of white flight may be a moot 
point 
records show that 50 students previously in private or parochial 
schools have preregistered in the public schools for 198990 while 
60 students have transferred their public school records and 
transcripts to private or parochial schools in the natchez area an 
additional 30 transcripts were requested by students whose families 
have moved from natchez 
classes open sept 5 in the district which enrolled about 6400 
students in 198889 
when he ordered a sweeping desgregation in july us district 
judge william h barbour jr predicted that 560 to 700 white 
students 24 to 29 percent of white enrollment would leave 
private and parochial schools where classes started this week 
show increased enrollment but spokesmen say the numbers are less 
than expected a month ago 
adams county christian school reported fewer than 200 new 
students many of those are new to the natchez area and many are 
preschoolers and kindergarteners a staff member said earlier 
there were predictions the school might see as many as 600 new 
students 
enrollment at natchez cathedral school operated by the catholic 
diocese of jackson is up slightly this fall exact enrollment 
figures will be made public in september 
i really think its going to work i think finally the 
majority of people want to see what the end product will be what 
the school system is going to be like said george f west jr 
school board president really the response is interesting its 
totally different from what people had expected 
barbours ruling consolidates the predominantly white south 
natchez and allblack north natchez high student bodies into one 
they will attend the former south natchez campus in a school that 
will be known as natchez high 
the former north natchez campus will be a middle school for 
grades 7 through 9 the judges ruling also created two elementary 
school attendance zones and paired an allblack school with a 
majoritywhite school in each zone 
buckley said that if enrollment holds up the district will not 
have to lay off any of its 450 teachers administrators had feared 
that between 14 and 40 teachers could lose their jobs if enrollment 
fell drastically

yes it answered putting forward the partys reforms championed

framework of the soviet union and call for the scrupulous and 
friendly labor needed to implement them 
according to official media and local activists more than 1 
million people stood handinhand across the baltic republics on 
wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a secret agreement between 
adolf hitler and josef stalin that put the thenindependent nations 
into the soviet orbit 
the gigantic protest organized by grassroots groups in estonia 
lithuania and latvia reflected activists growing calls for full 
independence from moscow instead of merely increased sovereignty 
ive never lived in an independent lithuania said graphic 
illustrator audrius ciocys 30 as he stood in the line with his 
wife and 3yearold son i believe there will be one for my son 
there must be 
edgar savisaar leader of the estonian peoples front said he 
believed the republics parliament might decide as soon as october 
to schedule a republicwide referendum on independence 
faced by a protest of such astonishing scale the soviet 
governments position seemed to be that the demonstrations aims 
were so vague that the turnout could not be seen as a wholesale 
endorsement of baltic nationalists demands for independence 
theres a varied picture there foreign ministry spokesman 
yuri a gremitskikh told a regular news briefing in moscow some 
prominent political figures yesterday in the baltic republics said 
they thought that issues that are raised should be resolved by 
political means and i believe we could quite agree with that 
opinion 
in its coverage of the baltic protest the soviet government 
daily izvestia gave a sympathetic account of the formation of the 
human chain but condemned other demonstrations by harderline 
groups that for example in vilnius lithuania bore signs linking 
the nazi swastika with the soviet hammer and sickle 
on aug 23 1939 hitler and stalin divided eastern europe into 
spheres of influence and less than a year later stalin annexed the 
baltic states 
moscow radio on wednesday quoted a moscows historians 
dismissal as unlawful any attempts to claim that the soviet hold 
on the baltic states is invalid because it stems from the 1939 pact 
gremitskikh told reporters the soviet union is not the only 
country with a stake in baltic tranquility 
if you rock the multinational soviet boat at the same time you 
rock the common european boat and you know quite well by now that 
we live in a very closely knit and interdependent world the 
foreign ministry spokesman said the stability of any individual 
state is just part of the general stability 
official estimates provided by the tass news agency said 500000 
people turned out for the protest in lithuania a republic of 37 
million people and that 300000 of estonias 16 million people 
took part 
there was no official estimate from latvia but the peoples 
front grassroots organization in riga estimated that 400000 people 
turned out there 
moscow activists tried to organize a sympathy protest but police 
and a special antidemonstration unit broke it up tass said 75 
people were detained 
in the southwestern soviet republic of moldavia also annexed by 
the soviet union under the secret agreement about 10000 people 
attended an outdoor rally in heavy rain activists reported

leaders of the naacp say they expect several 
thousand people to gather on the capitals monument grounds saturday 
for a civil rights demonstration modeled after the historic silent 
march conducted 72 years ago in new york city 
the washington reprieve will be concerned with one issue alone 
the supreme court and its recent hostile decisions diluting 
affirmative action and minority setaside programs according to 
benjamin l hooks executive director of the naacp 
but the brief march led by six drummers with muffled drums is 
designed to duplicate in tone and style the 1917 demonstration in 
which 8000 people led by web dubois paraded in silence down 
new york citys fifth avenue to protest segregation and the 
lynchings of blacks in the south 
organizers have asked men to wear black and women to children to 
wear white the march will culminate with a rally at the capitol 
where hooks and other civil rights leaders will speak the rev 
jesse jackson and the rev jospeh lowery head of the southern 
christian leadership conference and mayors kurt schmoke of 
baltimore and marion barry of washington also are scheduled to 
appear 
hooks and other naacp officials would not predict a turnout more 
specific than several thousand hooks said we are not looking 
toward bringing vast numbers of peopole to washington in this 
instance the medium is the message and the medium is the silent 
march 
the supreme court has often been the target of major 
demonstrations in the capital in recent years last spring an 
estimated 325000 turned out to urge the court to stand by its 1973 
decision which legalized abortion but the court weeks later 
softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for antiabortion 
forces

a fugitive greek banker accused in a 
multimilliondollar embezzlement scheme that helped topple the 
government of premier andreas papandreou may be extradited to his 
homeland a magistrate ruled thursday 
in her order of extradition us magistrate joyce alexander 
found that the charges facing george koskotas merited extradition 
under a united states treaty with greece particularly his alleged 
use of a fraudulent travel visa 
koskotas 35 former chairman of the bank of crete is accused by 
greek authorities of embezzling 200 million from 1986 to 1988 by 
placing the banks funds in his own accounts and accounts held by 
his associates 
koskotas maintains he acted with the approval of papandreou and 
put the money into accounts controlled by the premiers party 
alexanders ruling clears the way for the state department to 
send koskotas back to greece according to assistant us attorney 
victor a wild 
susan kempe a greek desk officer at the state department in 
washington could not immediately say what action the department 
would take 
however alexander granted attorneys for koskotas a stay to 
prepare an appeal koskotas will remain in custody 
koskotas had earlier refused to testify at his extradition 
hearing 
i am afraid if i testify here today i would endanger the lives

gov richard celeste welcomed a nineweek 
extension of a chinese art exhibit thursday weeks after blocking 
china from taking part in the ohio state fair because of the deadly 
crackdown on students in beijing 
the closing day of the exhibition which has attracted 530000 
visitors since it opened march 1 was extended from sept 4 to nov 
5 
the governor said at a news conference that ending the exhibition 
early had been considered in response to the attack by chinese 
government troops on prodemocracy students in beijing in which 
hundreds were believed killed but said that was considered 
inappropriate 
celeste said there was no inconsistency in extending the exhibit 
within weeks of telling the chinese they could not participate in 
the fair 
this is an exhibit sent here to help encourage understanding of 
several thousand years of chinese art and history and would help us 
to put perhaps events in china in some kind of a historical 
context he said 
the participation in the ohio state fair was an altogether 
different matter it was something that was directly related to the 
relationship that we have had with our sister province hubei 
celeste said 
it was with great reluctance even there that i took the actions 
that i took but i think weve conveyed a message about how people 
in ohio feel about current events in china he said 
celeste said the exhibition was a unique venture which should be 
encouraged to continue it was organized by the overseas 
archaeological exhibition committee of the peoples republic of 
china and son of heaven inc of seattle 
son of heaven has drawn visitors from all 50 states and from 50 
nations

scientists searching the 
bottom of crater lake said thursday that they have found evidence of 
hot springs a finding that could influence commercial energy 
development outside the park 
oregon state university oceanographer jack dymond reported 
measuring a temperature of 64 degrees monday in a mat of bacteria 
near the bottom of the lake that is about 26 degrees higher than 
the surrounding water 
we found the temperatures weve been looking for for three 
years said crater lake national park biologist jim milestone he 
said the lake bottom exploration now will concentrate on measuring 
the flow of water from the point where the temperature was recorded 
crater lake the nations deepest 1932 feet and clearest 
lake was formed when the mount mazama volcano erupted about 6800 
years ago and collapsed to form a gigantic bowl called a caldera 
the underlying rock is still warm from volcanic activity and the 
lake rarely ices over in winter 
california energy co is drilling an exploratory hole less than 
one mile from the southeast corner of the park boundary in the 
winema national forest in hopes of developing a geothermal power 
plant using underground hot water or steam to generate electricity 
the national park service fears the drilling could affect 
geothermal activity under the lake or that drilling fluids could 
migrate through the rock to vents where hot water flows into the 
lake and affect its water quality officials also dont know if the 
drilling could affect the way water leaves the lake which is filled 
by rain and snowmelt and has no surface outlet 
the agency also doesnt want the noise and steam clouds that 
would be created by power generation so close to the park boundaries 
dymond made the temperature readings in a oneman submersible 
that he has used to explore the lake this month the reading was 
taken near the spot where dymonds colleague robert collier 
recorded a temperature of 61 degrees one day earlier during a dive 
in the submersible 
park superintendent robert benton said it was uncertain how this 
new evidence would affect the parks fight against the geothermal 
energy exploration 
thats a political decision benton said i would be 
technically a lot more confident when they put the whole package 
together 
congress last year declared the park as containing significant 
geothermal features however that status is up for review pending 
the results of the current threeyear exploration of the lake bottom 
if the parks significant geothermal status holds up the 
secretary of the interior department would have the power to curtail 
future geothermal development outside the park if it could threaten 
features in the lake 
in another development milestone said high levels of radon gas 
have been measured in mysterious blue pools discovered earlier this 
month on the lake bottom 
milestone said that radon in excess of 700 decays per minute per 
100 liters was measured in samples from the blue pools that 
compares to radon levels on the lake surface of 1 decay per minute 
per 100 liters

americans once resistant to the idea of paying 
for public school changes now are willing to pay higher taxes to 
implement a variety of school reforms including a national 
curriculum a gallup poll said thursday 
in fact 70 percent of those questioned for the 21st annual 
gallup poll of the publics attitudes toward public chools released 
by phi delta kappa a professional educational fraternity favored 
requiring public schools to conform to national achievement 
standards and goals only 19 percent were opposed and 11 percent 
were undecided 
ten years ago a gallup poll showed a twotoone opposition to 
federal curriculum standards 
as for taxes 64 percent of the respondents in the latest file 
said they would pay higher taxes to improve the quality of public 
schools in poorer communities in 1983 58 percent said they would 
pay higher taxes to raise the standards of public education 
the public is more receptive to higher taxes than they have 
been in the past this is a change that is quite a change a major 
change said alec n gallup coauthor of the report in the 
past they almost invariably said no to higher taxes 
john rowley president of phi delta kappa said the public is 
more willing now to have a national curriculum because of the 
results states have gotten from statewide tests 
the public is ready for traditionshattering changes in the 
policies that govern us public schools said the poll based on 
inhome interviews conducted in early may and early june 
americans rate the quality of public schools poorly with only 8 
percent giving an a 35 percent a b 33 percent a c 11 
percent a d and 4 percent an f nine percent did not know or 
did not reply according to the poll 
key findings of the survey were 
reducing class sizes in early grades was supported 75 percent to 
18 percent while 68 percent said they would be willing to pay higher 
taxes to make that possible 
60 percent favored allowing pupils and their parents to choose 
which public schools in their communities youngsters will attend 
thirtyone percent were opposed and 9 percent were undecided 
75 percent favored reducing class size in the early grades now 
often in the range of 20 to 35 pupils to as few as 15 pupils while 
18 percent were opposed 
with those who favored requiring public schools to conform to 
national achievement standards and goals 61 percent wanted the 
standards to be set by professional educators 20 percent wanted a 
panel of parents and other lay people to set the standards and fewer 
than 10 percent wanted the standards set by the president congress 
or governors 
69 percent favored requiring public schools to use a 
standardized national curriculum while 21 percent were opposed and 
10 percent were undecided 
71 percent favored afterschool and summer programs for students 
whose parents work twentyone percent were opposed 
the idea of parental choice already state law in minnesota 
arkansas and iowa is a centerpiece of the administrations 
education policy 
findings of the new poll were largely consistent with results of 
a media generalassociated press poll in june twothirds of that 
sample favored more spending on public schools and nine out of 10 
in that group would accept higher taxes to pay for it fiftyeight 
percent said parents should be able to choose which public schools 
their children attend 
more than 40 percent favored yearround classes however 54 
percent of the media generalap respondents said they did not 
believe standardized tests reflect how well pupils are doing in 
school 
according to gallups results parental choice gets stronger 
support among nonwhites and young adults 67 percent for both 
groups and in western states at 64 percent twentyone percent 
believed parental choice would improve all schools only 14 percent 
believed choice would hurt all schools 
opponents of parental choice have contended that it would lead to 
some schools particularly those in disadvantaged areas being 
drained of students and resources 
nearly threefourths of those polled think it is very 
important to improve the nations innercity schools substantial 
majorities are willing to spend more taxes to expand head start 
programs 69 percent to screen young children for health problems 
74 percent and to provide day care for the children of working 
parents 58 percent 
the survey used a sample of 1584 adults spread through all areas 
of the nation and in all types of communities the margin of error 
is plus or minus 4 percentage points

wife cynthia 29 in the neck paralyzing her from the chest down

eligibility for aid for families with dependent children 
my heart goes out to judge cannon flowers said thursday 
hes a very very fair and understanding judge 
cannon said thursday i want to see that theyre taken care of 
immediately because apparently theyve been getting the runaround 
until this point 
flowers said social services officials initially told him his 
wife was not eligible for child care or other funds that would let 
him return to work he has turned over his auto sales and towing 
business to a relative so he can care for his wife fulltime 
i was told that if i divorced her shed be eligible for afdc

the new evangelical lutheran church in 
america held its first decisionmaking assembly thursday and quickly 
confronted two problems nagging many other denominations abortion 
and money 
abortion like many other issues on which the newly merged 
denomination so far has not established policies broke unscheduled 
into the process at a womens caucus meeting 
the caucus proposed a resolution opposing attempts to 
recriminalize or restrict abortion contending that action on the 
issue had become necessary because of the recent us supreme court 
decision permitting state restrictions 
to objections that a resolutions committee wanted to refer that 
issue to a planned twoyear study of sexuality barbara nelson of 
lindsborg kan replied 
it is a stopgap until that study is done its about whats 
happening in some states now 
the three major lutheran denominations in the united states the 
lutheran church in america the lutheran churchmissouri synod and 
the american lutheran church merged into the new 53millionmember 
church on jan 1 1988 the three denominations had taken varying 
positions on abortion 
the eightday assembly representing the fourthlargest body in 
us protestantism began wednesday 
on the troubling financial situation bishop herbert w 
chilstrom the denominations president told the approximately 
1050 delegates at the ohare exposition center you ought to get 
it out of your heads that there is some quickfix for the problem 
chilstrom said congregational giving was up a strong 55 percent 
last year outpacing inflation and totaling 11 billion 
but local churches used 92 percent of it either on 
congregational expenses or for local projects for the needy or 
special causes such as hunger relaying a reduced 8 percent for work 
of regional synods or the national church 
as with most major denominations a higher percentage of funds 
is staying at the local level he said 
he said the denomination had a 158 million shortfall below its 
1043 million in expenditures in its first 14 months and a 
continuing deficit in its 1989 budget with expenditures cut from a 
planned 99 to 92 million 
to cope with the shortage childstrom detailed various measures 
taken to cut expenses including a hiring freeze curtailed travel 
reduced meetings no salary increase and some planned staff 
reductions 
it would seem out of the question for a reduction in services 
and programs that are offered churchwide he said 
a special program among congregations including an emphasis on 
tithing is planned to counter the financial squeeze 
chilstrom said that false assumptions about savings resulting 
from church mergers was behind the drop in congregational support to 
churchwide operations as well as mounting local costs and expanded 
local help projects 
the denominations executive council recommended a 1990 budget of 
1025 million with provisions that it be periodically revised to 
keep expenditures in line with revenues

when tadeusz mazowiecki faced the press 
thursday for the first time as prime minister of poland the modest 
journalist limited the limelight so he could talk with two men who 
guided him to his place in history 
i would like to say that having left this room in a moment i 
will call the holy father john paul ii and then the first prime 
minister from solidarity will get through to lech walesa 
mazowiecki said as he concluded the news conference 
then he thanked the scores of journalists who had peppered him 
for more than an hour with questions on everything from his economic 
plan to his travel schedule and urged them to change their focus 
i ask you for further interest not in myself but in poland in 
our common problems and for friendliness 
after president wojciech jaruzelski nominated the solidarity 
editor as prime minister saturday journalists besieged his cramped 
offices at the independent movements weekly newspaper hoping for a 
few words with the man about to lead the east blocs first 
noncommunist government 
before meeting the press thursday mazowiecki visited his new 
spacious offices at the council of ministers building below the 
cavernous hall where the news conference was held 
i wanted to see i noticed that it was a little bit dark in 
there the windows are small but the space is huge id like to 
preserve some human element he said 
a journalist since he founded the catholic monthly wiez or link 
in 1958 mazowiecki spoke thursday about the problems of the press 
in poland where the communist government has tightly controlled 
newspapers radio and television 
solidarity was granted access to the mass media in the april 
accords that led to restoration of its legal status after a 
sevenyear ban the vigorous underground press went public and 
lines form for mazowieckis weekly and the opposition daily as soon 
as they hit the newsstands 
solidarity also was given limited time on tv and radio and 
censorship rules have been much relaxed 
the new prime minister said he is determined that society be 
honestly informed about his governments activities 
i want this government to tell the truth he said 
but asked whether he would abolish censorship mazowiecki replied 
the president and parliament were responsible for changes in that 
policy 
in the coming months the news may be bitter as mazowiecki tries 
to put together an economic plan to fight inflation meet a 39 
billion foreign debt and fill stores with goods shoppers can afford 
or want to buy 
mazowiecki asked for time to name ministers representing polands 
many political factions and develop an economic approach 
my first task is to form the government and get acquainted with 
everything im not going to show any bright ideas right now because 
they wouldnt be true maybe ill be able to tell you more in a few 
days he said 
that government that will be different from any he has known for 
45 years and mazowiecki was asked about trips he probably never 
thought he would take in a role he hardly could have imagined 
of course i will be happy to go to moscow and i will be happy 
to go to washington if such is the need of poland he said 
the country to send the first telegram of congratulations was 
unexpectedly east germany a warsaw pact ally that has been highly 
skeptical of the radical departures from socialism undertaken by its 
neighbor to the east 
mazowiecki said polands democratic reforms do not represent a 
threat to countries within the military alliance that he has pledged 
to respect 
i dont think that people striving for reforms should be 
identified with enemies of the warsaw pact and those who want to 
undermine it he said 
the new prime minsiter also said he expected a cordial 
relationship with jaruzelski who only eight years ago declared 
martial law to suppress solidarity and imprison thousands of 
activists including mazowiecki 
it is my task and duty as prime minister to fully respect the 
competences of the president and i hope for full respect for myself 
on the part of the president my first contacts with the president 
show that it is going to be like that he said 
he appealed for patience from poles many of whom are more 
interested in a quick improvement in their living standards than 
dramatic steps toward democracy 
i think that at the moment we should hope id like to express 
such hope and ask people who are on strike or intend to to enable 
this government to form itself and begin its activities he said 
and he set his goal what i would like to achieve and i say 
this with all sincerity and openness is what poland needs very 
badly creation of a new climate

researchers announced thursday that they had discovered and 
isolated the gene that causes cystic fibrosis a landmark finding 
that could lead to new treatments for the devastating killer of 
young people 
the discovery should help reveal just what goes wrong in the body 
to cause the disease which in turn may suggest how to treat the 
root of the disease rather than just its effects scientists said 
the work will also help permit greatly expanded testing to 
identify the estimated 12 million americans who unknowingly carry 
the gene in a defective form that causes the disease and who could 
pass it along to offspring said researcher lapchee tsui 
these carriers remain healthy because they carry only a 
single copy of a defective form of the newfound gene the disease 
does not appear unless a person inherits two defective copies one 
from each parent 
currently carriers can be identified only if their family has 
had a case of cystic fibrosis and even then not all carriers can be 
detected knowing the gene should eventually make testing available 
to the general population scientists said 
tsui of the hospital for sick children research institute in 
toronto spoke in a telephone interview before participating in a 
news conference to announce the finding 
tsui jack riordan of the institute and francis collis of the 
howard hughes medical institute and the university of michigan at 
ann arbor led the research team which also included scientists from 
the frederick cancer research facility in frederick md and the 
university of pittsburgh 
cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of 
young people in north america it afflicts about 30000 americans 
and 1000 to 1200 new cases are diagnosed each year according to 
the cystic fibrosis foundation in bethesda md 
the disease makes the body produce abnormally thick sticky mucus 
that clogs the lungs and digestive system interfering with 
breathing and digestion 
half of patients die before reaching their mid20s mostly from 
repeated lung infections 
for cystic fibrosis the discovery of the gene is the most 
exciting event since this disease was first described in the medical 
literature 50 years ago said robert beall executive vice 
president for medical affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation 
which helped support the research 
it may allow researchers to mimic the disease in cells in the 
test tube allowing them to screen drugs for therapeutic effect he 
said 
its incredibly important said nancy lamontagne director of 
the cystic fibrosis program at the national institute of diabetes 
and digestive and kidney diseases in bethesda md 
it will cause an exponential burst of good research to 
identify the basic problem that causes cystic fibrosis and then 
seek treatments aimed at that problem she said 
if you know exactly what youre trying to fix then you can 
approach it with a more specific bullet she said 
because of the diseases importance finding the gene is the 
big prize said michael conneally professor of medical genetics 
and neurology at indiana university medical center 
but arthur beaudet of the howard hughes medical institute at the 
baylor college of medicine cautioned that the discovery will not 
necesarily lead to effective treatment the basic defect that causes 
sickle cell anemia has long been known but that has not led to an 
effective therapy he said 
genes are segments of a threadlike structures called chromosomes 
the newfound gene is on the chromosome scientists refer to as no 7 
one important job of genes is to oversee the bodys production of 
key proteins genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis can occur 
when a gene is defective so that it fails to produce a normal 
protein 
tsui said the normal role of the newly discovered gene is not 
known but the protein it helps produce appears to be similar 
structurally to a family of genes involved in transporting 
substances across cell membranes he said 
that fits in with the suspicion that cystic fibrosis results from 
a defect in a cells ability to transport electrically charged

researchers identified an abnormality in the gene that appears to 
be responsible for most cystic fibrosis cases tsui said other 
mutations in the same gene apparently cause the remainder of the

the identified abnormality did not appear in chromosomes known to 
be normal he said in addition the gene appears to be activated 
only in the kinds of cells involved in cystic fibrosis he said

senior solidarity activist tadeusz 
mazowiecki was elected prime minister thursday in a historic switch 
from communist rule that he said should give the green light to 
polish hope 
the once inconceivable change for eastern europe came about not 
through revolution but in an orderly parliamentary vote with 
communist party members joining solidarity deputies to elect the 
journalist and former political prisoner 3784 with 41 abstentions 
it was the first noncommunist government to be seated in warsaw 
since 1944 
among the first to celebrate was solidarity chief lech walesa 
who engineered the coalition that gave mazowiecki a solid majority 
in parliament and then got communist president wojciech jaruzelski 
to go along with the deal 
i will do everything so that my premier my child passes 
the test before society pledged a jubilant walesa in gdansk after 
watching mazowieckis election on television he wished mazowiecki 
success in transforming our country from a totalitarian system to 
democracy 
congratulations also arrived from president bush and from the 
prime minister of communist east germany one of the least 
reformminded countries in the east bloc 
the soviet union for whom poland is the largest and most 
strategic warsaw pact ally greeted the election with equanimity 
we shall regard comrade mazowiecki as our partner in the 
relations that link our two countries said foreign ministry 
spokesman yuri gremitskikh in moscow 
the soviet union invaded hungary in 1956 and led an invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 to maintain orthodox communist rule 
but soviet president mikhail s gorbachev now rejects interfering 
in the affairs of his allies and moscows political analysts 
apparently believe a government under solidarity is polands best 
hope for stability 
members of every party including the communists joined in to 
support mazowiecki and the election was greeted by a standing 
ovation first the solidarity deputies stood then members of minor 
parties and finally the entire communist delegation 
a solemnlooking mazowiecki rose and gave a long bow to the 
chamber 
i am very touched at this moment i thank you for this 
great proof of trust he said urging that they raise up poland 
together 
after his election mazowiecki met for a halfhour with gen 
jaruzelski at the presidents office and sipped champagne with the 
staff of his former newspaper the weekly tygodnik solidarnosc 
before facing journalists at a packed news conference 
i can see a green light for polish hope which our nation must 
light for itself by fighting above all for something for 
democratic and economic changes above all for something and not 
against someone he told reporters 
after the news conference mazowiecki said he planned two 
telephone calls first to polishborn pope john paul ii his friend 
and then to walesa 
he said he want to assemble a cabinet within the next week and 
would seek participation by all the parties in parliament including 
the communists but he refused to be specific about how many posts 
for each 
the solidarityled coalition committed itself in advance to 
giving the key ministries of defense and internal affairs with 
control of the army and police to the communist party mazowiecki 
indicated wednesday he would find other posts for communists as well 
but he told communist deputies before the vote that it would make 
no sense for solidarity to form a government with just the prime 
ministry and a few minor ministries 
after mazowieckis election 15 communist party parliament 
deputies on behalf of the partys caucus submitted a proposal to 
drop from the constitution a clause that mandates the communist 
party be the leading political force in society 
mazowiecki will have to wrestle with daunting economic troubles 
including a 39 billion foreign debt inflation climbing toward 200 
percent annually and empty store shelves 
he said he would seek economic support from the west but no 
special privileges while trying to unlock the dormant energies 
of poles 
mazowiecki said he will support polands east bloc treaty 
obligations telling a questioner pointedly that it was wrong to 
identify people striving for reforms as enemies of the warsaw 
pact 
i want to form a government capable of acting for the good of 
society the nation and the state mazowiecki told the sejm 
his speech stressed the need to restore normal political and 
economic life to poland including transition of power between 
political parties and a marketoriented economy 
the state cannot take care of everything and guarantee 
everything he said poland cannot afford ideological 
experiments any longer 
his election came barely 15 months after he and walesa led a 
disappointed group of strikers out of the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
without winning any of their demands the end to a nationwide wave 
of labor unrest in april and may 1988 
the strike followed by a bigger strike wave in august persuaded 
authorities to renew a dialogue with solidarity which was 
eventually legalized in april and won 260 of 261 seats it contested 
in june parliamentary elections 
mazowiecki recalled that strike defeat thursday 
i think that neither them nor i thought that exit would lead to 
my entrance here today he said

historic apartment building when a threestory scaffold collapsed 
but officials said thursday the damage wasnt nearly as bad as it 
looked 
everything is just cosmetic really said manuel weber 
director of maintenance for the louisiana state museum which owns 
the 138yearold lower pontalba 
some sections of balcony and iron railings were pulled down in 
the accident said weber but bricks that appeared to be missing 
after the collapse actually had already been removed as part of a 
renovation project 
no one was hurt when the scaffolding collapsed wednesday evening 
no dollar estimate of the damage was available 
no cause for the collapse has been determined weber said state 
officials met with the contractor thursday and determined that 
everyone involved was properly insured he added 
authorities roped off the area around the building and a crane 
lifted debris from the square thursday afternoon 
the threestory stateowned building was completed in 1851 and 
with a companion building on the opposite side of jackson square 
was undergoing a 10 million renovation 
the project is to replace the brick brick by brick on this 
end of the pontalba buildings said james sefcik director of the 
state museum with headquarters nearby 
wednesdays accident was the second involving a jackson square 
building in 16 months in may 1988 fire destroyed the top floor of

businessman larry jackson expected an 
overdue shipment of weightlifting gloves the package he opened 
however contained an estimated 2 million in uncut gems 
do i feel like a fool for turning it in he said with a laugh 
thursday yeah 
the 50pound locked and sealed steel container was delivered by 
american eagle airlines wednesday to jacksons business atlas 
fitness products inc 
the box had no return address but it came with airline paperwork 
showing it was the lost piece of a 25package shipment of 
weightlifting gloves jackson received in july from pakistan 
jackson took delivery even though it didnt resemble his usual 
glove shipments you dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure 
out that this was not what it was supposed to be i mean it came in 
what was like a little vault he said 
so jackson called the us customs office 
the inspector on duty said just to hold it and return it to the 
shipper said liz orgeron a customs spokeswoman in new orleans 
but jackson a reserve deputy with the knox county sheriffs 
department said he became concerned when no one retrieved the box 
by the end of the day 
i did not want to be responsible for it because i knew it was 
something that appeared to be of great value he said 
jackson called the sheriffs department and a detective was sent 
out but the detective didnt want to take possession of the package 
without knowing what was inside 
i understand his point jackson said the thing came from 
the islamic world god knows what was in it it could be cobra 
venom or a bomb or something 
with the help of a local auto mechanic and his blowtorch the box 
was opened 
inside were more than 50 quartzlike stones some purplish 
others milky white wrapped in afghan newspapers 
a local jeweler after consultation with a colleague determined 
the uncut gems were kunzite which are native to afghanistan and 
conservatively estimated their value at 2 million 
ms orgeron said american eagle was trying wednesday to track 
down the gems owner airline officials at company headquarters in 
dallas did not return phone calls 
ms orgeron said it was unclear where the package was supposed to 
go but the airline determined it was definitely not knoxville she 
said the routing problem likely occurred when the package passed 
through john f kennedy airport near new york city 
the gems were being kept in a vault at the sheriffs department 
awaiting pickup by customs officials said sheriff joe fowler 
jackson meanwhile is still wondering where his missing gloves 
are customs promised me they were going to make an effort to find 
them he said thats the least they can do since im not 
allowed to keep the stones

scottish psychiatrist rd laing who became a guru 
of the 1960s counterculture by arguing that madness probably was the 
only way to face the modern world is dead at age 61 
his son adrian said laing died wednesday while playing tennis in 
st tropez france 
laing pioneered new treatment for schizophrenics believing them 
to be victims of family stress he contended there was little 
distinction between the sane and the mad that most psychiatry 
increased patient misery and that marijuana should be legalized 
his unorthodox views caused uproar in his profession for nearly 
three decades but he lived to see fellow psychiatrists take the 
heresies seriously 
he made individual contributions to new and constructive 
thinking about the care of psychiatric patients said a statement 
from the royal college of psychiatrists 
laings first book the divided self an existentialist study 
in sanity and madness in 1960 made him famous and wealthy he 
wrote 14 other books including a volume of sonnets 
he recently had been living in austria with his commonlaw wife 
margarita and their infant son who survive him 
adrian laing 31 one of two sons by his first wife told the 
associated press his father collapsed on a tennis court at st 
tropez while on vacation but said he did not know the cause of 
death 
its a shock he said he was an antiestablishment 
character but wasnt an antipsychiatrist he was more an 
alternative psychiatrist in later life he matured and mellowed 
he wanted to listen more to what people were saying to look at 
schizophrenic minds from their point of view the son said his 
idea was just to let them go crazy just let them get on with it he 
said youve got to understand the politics of the family 
ronald david laing was born in a threeroom tenement apartment in 
glasgow where his father was a city engineer on oct 7 1927 he 
wrote in the facts of life published in 1976 that his father 
beat him for minor infractions of orders and his parents never tried 
to communicate with or understand him 
he said he was influenced by sigmund freud soren kierkegaard 
karl marx and friedrich nietzsche 
after receiving a doctorate at glasgow university laing served 
with a psychiatric unit in the army and studied psychoanalysis at 
the tavistock institute in london 
laing refused to treat patients with drugs or electric shock 
unless they requested them his bestknown practical experiment was 
to establish kingsley hall a london hostel for schizophrenics 
where he pioneered therapeutic use of mescaline and lsd 
his policy was to have people staying there to go through 
madness as a selfhealing process his son said 
in 1964 laing founded the philadelphia association a network of 
establishments to house the mentally distressed without conventional 
treatment 
david mercers play in two minds influenced by laing and 
filmed by ken loach in 1971 as family life indicted suburban 
living by showing a 19yearold girl driven to mental collapse by 
emotional and family problems 
in later life laing had a private practice in london he became 
inrterested in zen buddhism in the 1970s and published transcripts 
of conversations between himself and his children 
he also is survived by his first wife anne and their two sons 
and two daughters who include adrian and fiona the elder daughter 
who spent years in mental institutions and was treated for 
schizophrenia 
two sons and a daughter from a second marriage also survive as 
well as a son by another commonlaw wife adrian said 
among laings other books are sanity madness and the family 
reason and violence and his account of the first 30 years of his 
life the making of a psychiatrist published in 1985 
he was working on a book called sex and jealousy when he died

flush with success researchers 
returned thursday to the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald hoping for 
more startlingly clear views of the famed vessel 556 feet beneath 
the surface of lake superior 
the tension is off said carol swinehart of michigan sea 
grant one of the sponsors of an expensive expedition to explore 
shipwrecks with a small deepwater robot that takes 
threedimensional video pictures 
on wednesday the robot obtained the first footage of the 
fitzgerald the best known and most recent major great lakes 
shipwreck the 730foot american ore carrier sank in a gale in 
november 1975 in canadian waters 17 miles off the coast of northern 
michigan all 29 crew members died their bodies never were 
recovered 
the tragedy became legend within a year when canadian balladeer 
gordon lightfoot sang all that remains is the faces and the names 
of the wives and the sons and the daughters 
observers on the research ship grayling were stunned by the 
clarity of the images the robot relayed wednesday 
this is amazing totally amazing said archaeologist phil 
wright of the canadian marine heritage conservation program he 
watched a video monitor intently as the robot glided around the bow 
of the wreck peering close into broken windows then backing up to 
see the battered white ship sitting upright in the mud 
the fitzgerald showed little age there was minimal rust and even 
less sediment the handset of a radiotelephone dangled from a 
pilothouse window one of the few signs that there had ever been 
life aboard the silent vessel 
searchers had expected to encounter bodies but none was seen in 
the initial exploration wednesday 
we are not here to disturb we are only here to remember may 
their souls rest in peace grayling capt clifford wilson said in 
a short shipboard memorial service before the robot was lowered to 
the underwater grave site 
the wreck lies in two pieces the bow rising upright out of the 
mud and behind it the overturned stern 
the halfinch thick steel hull was crinkled and torn just like 
tinfoil said chris nicholson of deep sea systems international 
who piloted the robot from a dark control room aboard the grayling 
researchers saw crisp images of portholes burst by the force of 
the water and electronic equipment torn from its moorings yet a 
water cooler remained standing with its stainless steel spout still 
gleaming and the ships bell sat unmarred on top with its clapper 
held silent by a thin cord 
outstanding tom farnquist director of the great lakes 
shipwreck historical society and one of three expedition leaders 
said as the robot completed its work wednesday night i was 
surprised by the visibility i was surprised that the bell was 
sitting on top its just unreal

green cards which reflect an aliens 
permanent resident status in the united states and have been 
offwhite since 1977 are being changed to pink in an effort to 
curtail the black market in the documents an official said thursday 
you can buy a lousy reproduction of the old green cards for 
5000 to 10000 said immigration and naturalization service 
spokesman verne jervis 
but people have been known to pay 20000 he said it 
depends on how much money the person has how good the card is and 
how much the person is willing to pay 
some people will pay an almost unending amount of money for 
the cards he said 
those who hold the cards have all the rights and privileges of 
citizens except they cannot vote may not leave the country for more 
than a year without losing permanent resident status and do not hold 
us passports he said 
the new cards will be phased in over time said jervis 
production of the new cards began aug 1 at the immigration card 
facilitity in arlington texas the 4 million changeover of 
equipment will be completed within a few months but until then 
some of the cards being issued will remain the familiar offwhite 
color he said 
the ins changed the cards for several reason he said 
one its an improved card as far as duplicating it is 
concerned he said it has some additional security features 
such as the special ink that helps combat forgeries 
another reason is that the equipment that we have been 
producing the card on for the last 12 years is due for a replacement 
anyway jervis said new technology has evolved during that 
time as long as we have to get new equipment we may as well take 
advantage of the new technology 
one feature of the new card is a stamped expiration date he 
said the laminated cards will be valid for 10 years 
the cards also have the individuals picture fingerprint name 
date of birth and file number on the front and encoded information 
on the back he said 
the ins will not undertake the overwhelming task of replacing the 
10 million cards already held by permanent resident aliens said 
jervis 
the service replaces about 230000 cards a year that have been 
either lost or stolen or because of changes such as a changed name 
jervis said 
a good many of the 230000 were reported lost or stolen said 
jervis but he could not estimate how many of those may have ended 
up being sold on the black market 
the new cards because of the encoded information will enable 
those who want replacements to do so by mail rather than in person 
which had been required for the old cards he said 
the ins is processing applications of 18 million people who 
applied for temporary resident status under the amnesty program for 
those who have been in the united states since before 1982 the 
period to apply for that program ended in may 1988 after 18 months 
those people have one year to apply for permanent resident status 
he said 
in addition some 13 million special agricultural workers have 
applied for temporary resident status under a separate program and 
they will be given permanent resident status without need for 
additional application between december 1989 and december 1990 
jervis said

the bush administration is weighing the 
possibility of tightening existing sanctions against panama now that 
efforts by the organization of american states to achieve a 
democratic transfer of power are at an apparent dead end officials 
said thursday 
the reevaluation of administration policy toward panama followed 
what officials regarded as a disappointing outcome of a threemonth 
effort by oas mediators to promote a restoration of democratic rule 
in panama 
the officials declined to specify what economic measures against 
panama are under consideration last year the reagan administration 
froze panamas assets in the united states withheld fees owed to 
panama for panama canal operations and suspended certain trade 
benefits 
the measures have contributed to a substantial economic decline 
in panama 
after oas foreign ministers approved a blandly worded resolution 
early thursday following allnight discussions the us and 
panamanian delegations engaged in unusually heated verbal sparring 
with each side blaming the other for the impasse 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger compared gen 
manuel antonio noriega to adolf hitler and derided panama as an 
outlaw regime that deserves the censure of all oas member 
states eagleburgers remarks prompted a walkout by panamanian 
foreign minister jorge ritter 
in a vitriolic twohour rebuttal panamanian delegate romulo 
escobar betancourt blamed the united states for the lack of progress 
toward a political solution in panama citing both the us economic 
sanctions and what he described as the unsettling impact of us 
military maneuvers in panama 
he also challenged eagleburger to prove his allegations about 
noriegas involvement in drug trafficking 
if you have any evidence to show gen noriega is involved in 
drug trafficking bring it here to the oas escobar said noriega 
was indicted last year on drug smuggling charges by two federal 
grand juries in florida 
the oas resolution expressed deep concern over the inability 
of the mediators to lay the groundwork for a political settlement in 
panama it also resolutely exhorts panamanians to settle their 
differences by the time a new president is scheduled to be sworn in 
under panamas constitution an elected president is due to 
take office on sept 1 but ritter said it is unclear what will 
happen on that date because there is no officially recognized 
successor to president manuel solis palma 
panamanian authorities voided the outcome of last mays national 
elections after independent observers concluded that the opposition 
candidate had won by a comfortable margin 
ritter expressed hope that the government and opposition leaders 
can agree on a course of action by sept 1 that would enable the 
country to sidestep the possibility of a constitutional crisis 
at the state department thursday deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said the key to solving the problem is for noriega to be 
willing to discuss the terms for his departure 
state department officials were outraged wednesday when a report 
submitted by the oas mediators blamed the united states in part 
for the continuing impasse in panama without making any reference to 
noriega 
specifically the report said us military maneuvers in pamama 
had a negative effect on the negotiating process and were 
inopportune 
at the pentagon spokesman fred hoffman defended the us 
military exercises in the canal area saying they were conducted in 
accordance with the panama canal treaties and the us mission of 
defending the canal 
what were doing is not confrontational hoffman said we 
have notified the pdf panamanian defense forces in advance of 
these exercises they are are all covered fully under the terms of 
the treaties 
the official us view is that noriega precipitated the crisis by 
refusing to recognize the perceived victory by the opposition 
candidate in the elections last may and then aggravated the 
situation by insisting on retaining his post as commander of 
panamas military forces

the center for marine conservation accused the 
commerce department on thursday of squelching scientific findings 
and treating the issue of endangered sea turtle deaths as if it were 
a matter of soviet intrigue and espionage 
the agency caught between the opposing demands of shrimpers and 
environmentalists is under a court order to draft final regulations 
by sept 8 that would protect endangered sea turtles from drowning 
in shrimpers nets 
the public was given 15 days to comment and has deluged the 
department with thousands of letters but the center for marine 
conservation says it has been unable to obtain biological opinions 
from the agencys own scientists on the most effective way of 
preventing sea turtle deaths 
at issue is whether shrimpers must be required to equip their 
nets with devices that allow turtles to escape the choice of 
environmentalists or whether they should restrict their tow times 
and check their nets before the submerged turtles drown the choice 
of many gulf coast shrimpers 
under temporary regulations shrimpers are being required to pull 
their nets every 105 minutes or use the turtle excluder devices 
teds 
the center for marine conservation said commerce has 
squelched biological recommendations and ignored the findings of 
its own scientists that teds are far more effective in preventing 
turtle deaths than restricted tow times 
the centers marydele donnelly accused the agency of withholding 
so much information on its scientists own studies that her 
organization has been forced to file freedom of information act 
requests 
conservation of endangered species is not a matter of soviet 
intrigue and espionage she said the american public has a 
right to know how and why commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
came to such outlandish conclusions regarding 105minute tow times 
when the record is clear that these regulations are based on false 
premises 
commerce spokesman brian gorman said every possible credible 
source of information from within and outside the agency is being 
considered as the final rules are drafted 
meanwhile public comment on the issue continues to pour in the 
national marine fisheries service has counted 3100 letters to date 
and more are coming in said charles karnella chief of the 
protected species management division 
he said the letters are overwhelmingly in favor of teds but 
would not provide a tally

the number of medicalschool applicants has 
declined for the fourth straight year and scores on admissions tests 
are down slightly but there is no immediate threat to quality 
medical care a researcher said thursday 
and while more women and minorities are applying to medical 
schools there is room for improvement said barbara barzansky 
assistant director of the american medical associations division of 
undergraduate education and coauthor of a study in fridays journal 
of the ama 
the increasing diversity is encouraging ms barzansky said 
but theres a lot more especially in the area of minorities 
that needs to be done 
while the number of freshmen increased slightly for the first 
time since 1984 applications and total enrollment still are down 
there are a lot more opportunities for young people these days 
where you can go out and start your career a lot sooner instead of 
having to spend four years in medical school and three years in 
residency ms barzansky said 
the number of applicants has dropped from 35944 in 1984 to 
28123 in 1987 and 26721 in 1988 the study showed 
but the number of freshmen in 1988 increased to 16781 from 
16686 the year before 
that means medical schools accepted one freshman student for 
every 16 applicants up from one out of every 21 in 1984 the 
report said 
average admissionstest scores for the students dropped slightly 
from 564 out of a total possible 90 in 1987 to 552 in 1988 
but ms barzansky said there was little cause for concern 
its not as if suddenly the whole medical school class has 
declined drastically she said students still have to meet the 
same standards for graduation 
ms barzansky said while applications and enrollment are down 
there is no immediate threat to the countrys supply of doctors 
if you look at the average number of physicians theres no 
shortage she said if you look at certain specialties there 
may be a problem 
possible problem areas include primarycare physicians mostly 
general practitioners and family doctors and those willing to work 
in rural and innercity areas she said 
there are still concerns about providing medical care across 
the country making sure everybodys got access ms barzansky 
said 
another study in the journal said 83 percent of medical school 
graduates had educationrelated debts 
the average owed was 38489 up from the 14600 owed on average 
by the 74 percent of 1974 graduates with debts said study coauthor 
paul jolly an associate vice president at the association of 
american medical colleges 
jolly and ms barzansky said increased financial aid is key to 
easing debts and boosting minority enrollment 
ms barzanskys study showed that blacks make up 6 percent of all 
medical school students 5 percent of 1988 graduates and 63 percent 
of last years freshmen 
asian enrollment was up from 76 percent among graduates to 124 
percent among entering freshmen while hispanic enrollment held 
steady at about 54 percent the study said 
minority enrollment is rising very slowly jolly said 
there is a lot of financial aid available for minority students 
but it is not enough 
the number of women in medical schools also has increased with 
women making up 37 percent of those entering classes and 333 
percent of graduates 
the total number of women in medical school however has 
declined since 1985 the study said

including oleg antonov alexei tupolev and sergei ilyushin who 
dominated soviet aviation for decades 
one western expert in moscow who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it had been unclear in recent years whether yakovlev 
was still in charge of design of yakovlev planes 
as a 20yearold aircraft fitter at moscows central airport in 
1927 yakovlev designed the air1 a light airplane that set a world 
record by covering the 800mile route from the crimean city 
sevastopol to moscow in 15 hours and 30 minutes 
the bestknown yakovlev planes of the past decade are the yak38 
known by nato experts as the forger the countrys only plane 
capable of landing and taking off from naval vessels and the 
120passenger yak42 shorthaul passenger jet 
yuri gagarin a test pilot who was the first man in space made 
his first flights in a yak18 training plane 
during world war ii yakovlevs fighter planes the yak1 through 
yak9 were the dominant force in the soviet air force of 61000 
fighters built by the soviet union during the war years 37000 of 
them were yaks 
in a 1976 article the weekly moscow news cited a telegram the 
soviet defense committee received from air force pilots telling them 
how they had fought off 25 german planes with seven yak1s 
the pilots showed that these soviet planes were more than a 
match for the famous messerschmitts and junkers it said 
in the opinion of western experts the design of the yak3 
considered one of the best of yakovlevs world war ii fighters was 
impossibly crude and the welding looked as if it had been done by 
a village blacksmith the paper said 
but the outer finish was superb and the plane was reliable it 
said 
in the postwar years as the mig became the dominant soviet 
jetfighter yakovlev increasingly turned his attention to civilian 
aircraft 
one such plane the yak55 was displayed on sunday in moscows 
first air show in more than 20 years 
yakovlev in a 1976 interview with the labor newspaper trud on 
his 70th birthday said i want to work and work so that i can 
penetrate still further into the unknown so that i can reach new 
unscaled summits this is the purpose of life for a designer

usbacked guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi ordered his fighters back to the battlefield in angola on 
thursday ending a fractured truce that was the countrys latest 
hope in a 14yearold civil war 
the rebel leader accused angolan government troops of launching a 
big military offensive against his fighters in southern angola on 
aug 17 
the angolan people to their infinite sorrow accept that the 
war has restarted savimbi said in a statement issued from his 
southern angolan stronghold of jamba and released in lisbon 
his announcement comes the day after seven of the african leaders 
who helped broker angolas june 24 ceasefire ended a meeting in 
harare zimbabwe to try to put the fractured peace process back on 
track 
cubanbacked angolan president jose eduardo dos santos sealed the 
truce with savimbi at a summit of 18 african leaders at gbadolite 
zaire 
the rebel leader thursday also said his national union for the 
total independence of angola rejected in the most violent terms 
a communique released by the leaders who met in harare 
in it they supported dos santos claim that savimbi agreed at 
the gbadolite summit to accept temporary and voluntary 
retirement during ceasefire and peace negotiations and that his 
guerrillas would be integrated into the existing angolan political 
structure 
savimbi says he would never agree to leave angola and wants peace 
on condition dos santos holds elections leading to a powersharing 
arrangement 
the rebel leader never has had the opportunity to test his 
popularity at the polls his followers have been at war since 
portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975 
leaving rival groups to fight for power 
angolan government and rebel delegates have held sporadic talks 
in zaire to try to resolve their differences since the ceasefire 
the united states which gives savimbi between 15 million and 
18 million in aid a year said wednesday it had expected another 
round of talks in zaire shortly 
state department spokesman richard boucher said national 
reconciliation in angola only can be achieved by direct negotiations 
between the two sides and siad washington has urged both parties to 
progress on the central issue of how to achieve reconciliation 
a major us oil company is among several international concerns 
that have interests in the oil and mineralrich nation and stand to 
benefit from peace there 
the angolan peace process followed usbrokered international 
accords signed in new york by which south africa pledged to halt aid 
to savimbi and allow angolas southern neighbor namibia to gain 
independence in return cuba began a phased withdrawal of its 
estimated 50000 troops from angola

the state department urged south africa on 
thursday to exercise restraint in dealing with demonstrations by 
blacks opposed to its apartheid racial policies 
the department said that recent waves of arrests of opposition 
leaders could endanger an emerging trend toward negotiations between 
the white minority and black majority 
the statement was prompted by several weeks of clashes between 
authorities and antiapartheid groups that launched a defiance 
campaign aug 2 to end the segregation of hospitals schools 
beaches and other facilities 
on thursday police in cape town fired tear gas at hundreds of 
protesting university students and arrested 22 white women from a 
civil rights group anglican archbishop desmond tutu a nobel peace 
prize winner was teargassed wednesday when police broke up a 
protest 
we call on all parties in south africa to reject the continuing 
cycle of violence the statement said one of the tragic results 
of this violence has been that now soon after large numbers of 
detainees had been released the government has begun to rearrest 
key opposition leaders 
the announcement said that events in south africa serve to 
underline the need which we have long advocated for the government 
to allow all sides to freely voice their opposition 
we again urge the south african government to create a climate 
in which real negotiations with legitimate black leaders can take 
place 
all sides should avoid actions that may reduce the chances for 
an early start to negotiations we call on the south african 
government to exercise maximum restraint in the use of force against 
peaceful political protesters it said

group

and demonstrators in the cape town area

detained dozens of activists anglican archbishop desmond tutu a 
nobel peace prize winner was among those teargassed at a 
demonstration on wednesday

a blatant lie insisting he had emerged from a church before 
tear gas was fired without warning at protesters outside police 
said tutu was inside at the time and that a warning was issued 
tutu also recounted his efforts to defuse volatile confrontations 
between police and protesters and demanded that police retract an 
allegation that he encouraged illegal actions 
the defiance campaign is aimed at ending segregation of 
hospitals schools neighborhoods beaches and other facilities

who took refuge in the west german embassy to leave hungary on 
thursday and they arrived in west germany officials said 
diplomatic sources said at least 190 others crossed the border 
into austria illegally on thursday 
up to 5000 east germans have reportedly reached the west by way 
of hungary almost all of them illegally since the exodus began in 
midjuly 
foreign minister gyula horn said 150000 to 200000 east germans 
are in hungary now and the official mti news agency quoted him as 
telling reporters an increasing number of them do not want to return 
home 
hungary one of the most liberal soviet bloc nations began 
removing barbed wire and other obstacles from its frontier with 
austria in may 
the strict east german regime seldom lets its citizens travel to 
the west but they have been able to visit neighboring hungary with 
ease 
the bonnbased die welt newspaper said thursday that east germany 
plans to impose strict new travel regulations to hungary as of sept 
1 to stem the refugee flow 
the east german foreign ministry called it an outright lie 
the staterun news agency adn quoted a ministry official as 
saying these lies and fabrications are being spread in cold war 
style to create confusion and to slander east germany the truth is 
that travel to hungary as well as to bulgaria and romania continues 
as usual 
the 108 east germans were allowed to travel west with documents 
provided by the international red cross on the basis of 
humanitarian considerations mti said 
austrian radio quoted austrian red cross officials as saying the 
international committee of the red cross in geneva organized the 
transfer in response to a request from bonn 
the group flew to vienna the austrian capital on a chartered 
flight and then continued by bus to west germany the officials said 
horn said hungary was not interested in any increase in the 
number of east germans staying here or in transit he said 
hungary views this a problem that must be solved by the two germanys 
witnesses confirmed reports that hungarian border guards 
intercepted a group of about 150 east germans who traveled to the 
border in three buses and three taxis wednesday 
one escaper who gave his name only as lothar k told the 
associated press about 50 guards used truncheons to disperse the 
group as they tried to walk toward the border with arms linked to 
protect women and children 
i never imagined something like that could happen he said on 
thursday 
he and his wife and child hid in the bushes throughout the night 
and then furtively crossed the border at daybreak he said 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said many 
others later escaped across the border at another point 
few reports of border violence have surfaced since the exodus 
began the shooting death monday of an east german who struggled 
with a hungarian border guard was deemed an accident by hungarian 
and austrian officials thursday 
a group of four young east germans who fled to austria thursday 
said a guard who caught them indicated when he sent them back that 
he would look away if they tried again a few hours later they tried 
again and succeeded with no guard in sight

tehran newspapers said thursday that 
hashemi rafsanjani the new president of iran will win 
parliamentary approval of his new cabinet despite opposition from 
radicals to his dismissal of hardliners 
the tehran times which often speaks for rafsanjani said his 
government choices would be approved only after a really sizzling 
debate scheduled to begin sunday 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted the 
englishlanguage daily as saying the debate could last three days 
hojatoleslam hussein sobhaninia a senior member of the majlis 
the 270seat parliament said a large number of deputies had

national unity the paper said

from the majlis said sobhaninia a member of the foreign policy 
committee according to the tehran times report 
noting that iraq still occupies iranian territory despite the 
truce declared a year ago in the eightyear war sobhaninia said 
if all the proposed ministers receive votes of confidence it will 
be another slap in the face of our enemies 
former president ali khamenei who became spiritual leader after 
the death june 3 of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini urged the majlis on 
wednesday to set aside political differences and support rafsanjani 
khamenei told the deputies they should vote on competence 
alone rather than differences of taste or god forbid personal 
matters 
khamenei rafsanjani and others generally considered pragmatists 
have denied a power struggle followed khomeinis death but the 
khamenei appeal underlined opposition to rafsanjanis policies and 
the ministers he has chosen 
radicals have considerable influence in parliament where 
rafsanjani was replaced as speaker by mehdi karrubi who was his 
deputy and advocates the vilent spread of khomeinis islamic 
revolution 
rafsanjani favors openings to the west to end irans isolation 
and attract aid and foreign investment he also seeks to liberalize

the state department said thursday it has no 
immediate plans to evacuate us government personnel from colombia 
in the aftermath of bombings by drug traffickers but acknowledged 
a very concrete threat exists against the bogota government 
the drug traffickers declaration of war on the colombian 
government certainly heightens the concern about security both 
for the colombian government and for ourselves state department 
spokesman richard boucher said 
it dramatizes i would say what weve long known and thats 
that these drug traffickers represent a very concrete threat to the 
institutions of the government of colombia he said 
however there are no plans to withdraw any us personnel in 
colombia and without such a plan the government would not even 
necessarily pay for travel of those us dependents who want to 
leave he said 
the embassy has always been on a high state of readiness 
state department spokesman richard boucher said wednesday that 
continues 
there are some 100 us officials with the embassy in bogota and 
about two dozen drug enforcement administration agents in the 
country according to officials 
no americans were hurt in the attacks early thursday in medellin 
home to the worlds largest cocaine cartel and the embassy in 
bogota was not aware of any bombings until diplomats heard 
reports on colombian radio another state department official said 
the united states formerly maintained a consulate in medellin 
but closed it in the early 1980s due to the threat a state 
department official said 
colombia is a danger post meaning that us diplomats posted 
there receive extra money to compensate for the risk and minor 
dependents are not allowed 
meanwhile administration and military sources reported that the 
joint chiefs of staff decided thursday to draw up a laundry list 
of military hardware for president bush to consider sending to 
colombia in the event that nation requests such material 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
the list sent to the white house included uh1 huey troop 
transport helicopters ammunition and radio equipment the military 
sources said 
no personnel is involved one source said indicating that 
the choppers would be flown by colombian pilots if they should be 
sent 
no precise numbers were disclosed but the source said the 
numbers were not extravagant 
the administration source said the list was not a formal 
recommendation but instead provided the president with a laundry 
list of items that the pentagon could provide if called upon to do 
so 
the source noted that the president has strictly ruled out the 
use of us military troops which is in line with the joint chiefs 
thinking 
last weekend the colombian government imposed a state of siege 
following a string of killings that culminated in the assassination 
of luis carlos galan a leading presidential candidate and an 
outspoken foe of drug traffickers 
the state of siege allows for quick extraditions of alleged drug 
traffickers wanted on us charges extraditions that ended abruptly 
in 1987 when the colombian supreme court under pressure from 
traffickers overturned the extradition agreement the traffickers 
have indicated that extradition is one of their major concerns due 
to their fears that they would not be able to escape as they have in 
colombia 
president bush contacted at the summer white house in 
kennebunkport maine said he had no real comment on the 
situation in colombia 
there will be meetings with the proper colombian officials in 
the not so many hours bush said as he prepared to meet the 
visiting prime minister of denmark 
the justice department anounced wednesday an agreement to offer 
colombia 2 million for a judicial protection program part of the 
5 million authorized by congress for such a program last year 
dozens of judges have been killed and most of the slayings have 
been traced to the drug cartels 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said plans for the 
program had been under discussion since april and that one reason 
the entire 5 million wasnt allocated was to give officials a 
chance to determine where the money could best be spent 
boucher said an additional 500000 was being allocated to 
purchase security equipment although he did not specify what kind 
of equipment 
colombian justice minister monica de greiff was quoted in 
thursdays washington post as saying that the us embassy refused 
to allow the colombian government to use some of the money to buy 
armored cars 
however a state department official said the purchase of armored 
cars is one of the things being considered for the remaining 25 
million 
its in our interests for their judges not to be blown up 
getting from home to work and back the official said 
the colombian government has arrested some 11000 people since 
the state of siege began but the only us officials have said they 
want to extradite is eduardo martinez romero an alleged money 
launderer for the medellin cartel who was indicted in march in 
atlanta 
the embassy has relayed a request for martinezs arrest which 
enables the colombians to hold him for 30 days on behalf of the 
united states according to boucher and an administration source 
said the extradition paperwork was being completed 
a us government plane has been at the bogota airport since last 
weekend and could be used to transport martinez to the united states 
for trial on the charges filed in atlanta in march according to the 
source

two japanese tv networks on thursday began regular 
broadcasts using a new television system that provides clearer 
pictures to special sets but can still be viewed on regular sets 
the system called extendeddefinition television or edtv 
produces more detailed pictures with deeper colors and fewer 
ghosts on sets equipped with special circuitry 
edtv will compete against another new highquality tv system 
called highdefinition television hdtv provides sharper images but 
involves a more radical redesign of tv standards and in some cases 
is incompatible with present equipment 
nippon television network said it will broadcast 56 hours of 
edtv programs a day the tbs network said it will begin with about 
three hours a week other networks in japan are expected to begin 
edtv broadcasts this month or in september 
we decided to begin edtv broadcasting because of our interest 
in improving picture quality and because of its better compatibility 
with current equipment said a tbs official on condition of 
anonymity 
many broadcasters see edtv as a more practical alternative to 
hdtv which requires a greater investment by stations and consumers 
current hdtv monitors in japan sell for about 60000 edtv sets are 
available for about 2800 
the tv system in common use in north america and japan divides 
the picture into 525 horizontal lines though not all the lines 
appear on the screen at once first oddnumbered lines are scanned 
and then one60th of a second later the even lines appear producing 
30 combined images each second 
the speed is too fast for the human eye to detect but it creates 
a flicker and fuzziness that is particularly noticeable on large 
screens and in scenes with rapid motion 
edtv uses special cameras that scan all 525 lines at once it 
transmits a reference signal letting tv sets detect and reduce 
ghosts or double signals reflected from buildings or other objects

farouk kaddoumi the plos equivalent of a 
foreign minister was quoted in an interview published thursday as 
offering to negotiate peace with israel 
farouk kaddoumi also said the current plo dialogue with the 
united states would not lead to a middle east settlement according 
to the report in al qoda jerusalem an arabiclanguage weekly 
based in london 
it said the interview was conducted in tunis where the palestine 
liberation organization has its headquarters 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel has proposed elections in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip where a palestinian uprising 
began more than 20 months ago to choose representatives who would 
negotiate with israel 
the plo insists that elections be held only under international 
supervision after israeli withdrawal from the territories 
washington is trying to give shamir more time to liquidate the 
uprising or enforce shamirs election plan kaddoumi was quoted as 
saying 
it is not possible for washington to alter its political stance 
unless it feels that its interests are in danger and it must respond 
to the palestinian demands 
any dialogue with israeli forces must be held outside the 
occupied territories he said there are israeli occupation 
authorities imposing their will on the palestinian people and local 
leaders in the occupied territories are under various political and 
psychological pressures 
this is why talks with israeli forces must be held outside the 
occupied territories and we are ready for such a dialogue 
he said of lowlevel talks with the united states being held in 
tunis we must not have any illusion that the dialogue with the 
united states would achieve the aspired results 
in december after plo chief yasser arafat publicly renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist the united states 
ended a 13year ban on dealings with the plo and the talks began

some compulsive gamblers personality traits 
particularly their tendency to enjoy risks and seek sensation 
partly may reflect disturbances in their central nervous systems a 
new study says 
other experts who work with gamblers say many factors including 
childhood experience can play a part in explaining the urge to bet 
researchers who wrote the study published in the august issue of 
the american medical associations archives of general psychiatry 
examined body fluids from 17 compulsive gamblers and found high 
levels of certain chemical reactions in their nervous systems 
the researchers also found that on a written personality test 
the gamblers had high scores for extraversion the tendency to 
be outgoing physically and socially active and to take risks 
researchers looked at chemicals taken from blood urine and 
spinal fluid that indicated activity in the bodys noradrenergic 
system which governs such diverse processes as the funtioning of 
organs and communications between nerve cells in the brain 
subjects were 17 men with a mean age of 36 who had met the 
psychiatric definition of compulsive gambler and participated as 
inpatients at the national institutes of health in bethesda md 
the study led by dr alec roy who has since left nih did not 
indicate when the research was done and roy could not be reached by 
telephone thursday 
whats most important about the article is that people are 
beginning to realize that compulsive gambling is an illness which 
is something i dont think pete rose is ready to admit said dr 
paul fink medical director of the philadelphia psychiatric center 
which runs a treatment program for pathological gamblers 
rose manager of the cincinnati reds was banned for life from 
major league baseball thursday for allegations that he bet on his 
own team rose denies the charges 
fink however cautioned that scientists dont know whether 
gambling for years raises the levels of certain chemical activity in 
compulsive bettors or the elevated levels tend to make people seek 
thrills like gambling 
were dealing with a chickenandegg whichcamefirst 
phenomenon he said its hard to base a concept that affects 
thousands of people on 17 cases 
durand f jacobs a board member of the new yorkbased national 
council on compulsive gambling a research training and referral 
group agreed 
i think the research is very important but it needs 
further testing and verification jacobs said by telephone from 
loma linda calif where he is psychology director of a veterans 
administration hospital 
jacobs said his own theory based on 30 years of research into 
addictions is that besides whatever biological conditions exist 
all addicts have had a childhood where theyve been subject to 
experiences that make them feel inferior they feel inadequate 
and no matter what they do its never enough 
dr richard j rosenthal a pyschiatrist at the university of 
california at los angeles said he has found a close association 
between compulsive gambling and outstanding athletes 
being people who are drawn to action and activity as a way of 
dealing with problems a way of soothing and comforting themselves 
it is very natural for them to be attracted to sports he said 
jean falzon executive director of the compulsive gambling 
council said the study should not be used as an excuse by gamblers 
people are responsible for their behavior she said by 
telephone from her pennsylvania home

prime minister herbert blaizes 
government suspended parliament on thursday amid opposition threats 
to bring it down with a noconfidence vote 
blaize 71 has been under intense pressure over what critics 
call an increasingly authoritarian style and in january lost 
leadership of his party 
thursdays announcement means blaize can govern without any 
parliamentary opposition until as late as february a month before 
general elections are due 
opposition leader george brizan accused blaize of treating 
parliament with ridicule and contempt during the caribbean 
islands most serious political crisis since the leftist revolution 
and subsequent usled invasion of 1983 
brizan was notified by letter that the legislature which was to 
convene friday after a recess is being suspended for an indefinite 
period 
under grenadas constitution the governor general of this former 
british colony can suspend parliament at any time for up to six 
months 
because general elections must be held by march 28 it appears 
unlikely a noconfidence vote can be introduced 
in january blaize lost leadership of the governing new national 
party to his popular public works minister keith mitchell 43 
the prime minister subsequently fired mitchell from his cabinet 
and two other cabinet ministers resigned in protest blaize opposes 
mitchells wish for a broad coalition to include members of the 
ousted marxist government 
the new national party now holds nine of the 15 seats in 
parliament and brizans national democratic congress has the other 
six in a noconfidence vote mitchell and the two other former 
cabinet ministers were expected to side with the oppositon causing 
the government to fall 
this confirms my view that the prime minister is not behaving 
like the person i knew in 1984 when he won the elections mitchell 
said thursday he now seems to put the will of the people last and 
his personal position and pique first 
blaize became prime minister on dec 3 1984 14 months after 
us troops and a small caribbean force invaded the island to topple 
a marxist junta that seized power in a bloody coup

winstonsalem nc ap a woman and her two children have 
filed a lawsuit claiming that a greyhound bus driver forced them to 
sit at the back of his bus on a transcontinental trip because they 
are black 
vickie h hairston of winstonsalem sued greyhound lines inc 
last week in forsyth superior court on behalf of herself and her 
children jemithra and joy hairston 
the lawsuit alleges that greyhound officials knew about what it 
calls the racial feelings of the driver and allowed him to 
continue working 
the lawsuit asked for more than 30000 in compensatory and 
punitive damages stemming from the 1986 incident 
these kinds of cases are rare anymore said romallus o 
murphy an attorney from greensboro who is representing mrs 
hairston with the help of the naacp all of the case law is from 
the early 1970s and 1960s 
it has been 34 years since rosa parks helped ignite the 
civilrights movement by refusing to move to the back of a city bus 
in montgomery ala 
the lawsuit says that mrs hairston and her two children boarded 
a greyhound bus in winstonsalem on aug 15 1986 bound for 
portland ore at the time jemithra was 11 years old and joy was 4 
while they were traveling from cheyenne wyo to rawlins wyo 
the lawsuit says the bus driver identified as joe kant began 
harassing mrs hairston and her children it says that the only 
reason for the harassment was their race 
at rawlins the lawsuit says kant told them that they would have 
to sit at the back of the bus when they refused they were 
informed that if they did not move to the rear of the bus they must 
seek other transportation the lawsuit says 
the lawsuit said that despite the support for the hairstons 
of white passengers and a police officer from the rawlins police 
force the driver insisted and that in great fear for their 
health and safety they moved to the rear of the bus as demanded 
many passengers on the bus have written to mrs hairston and 
volunteered to testify for her if she took legal action murphy 
said she did not file a lawsuit until now because she has little 
money and was uncertain about how to proceed he said 
the lawsuit says that the incident caused mrs hairston great 
emotional strain and even caused an attack of skin lesions because 
she suffers from lupus a skin disease 
the lawsuit does not name kant as a defendant it demands at 
least 10000 from greyhound for breach of contract at least 
10000 for negligence and at least 10000 for intentionally 
inflicting emotional distress on the hairstons 
there is some confusion however over who is being sued because 
the greyhound buslines divisions was split off from the parent 
company and sold in march 1987 the lawsuit says that it is suing 
greyhound lines inc a corporation in phoenix ariz 
the company now in phoenix is called the greyhound corporation 
brad parker a spokesman for that company said officials there know 
nothing about the lawsuit 
greyhound lines inc of dallas texas now owns the bus 
operations elizabeth hale a spokesman for that company said the 
company would not be legally responsible for any incident that 
occurred before it bought the bus service 
murphy said that he filed the lawsuit against the company that 
sold the tickets to mrs hairston

israel offered the colombian government help in 
fighting drugs and asked it for information thursday about israeli 
mercenaries who were said to have trained assassins for cocaine 
barons 
a defense ministry statement said an investigation revealed that 
the ministry denied a permit more than a year ago to hod hahanit a 
private security company said to be involved in the training 
acting without a permit would be a serious breach of the law 
the statement said 
the ministry said a second israeli firm it did not identify had 
violated terms of a permit to do security work in colombia but that 
no link to illegal activities had been established 
yair tsaban a legislator from the leftwing party mapam 
demanded defense minister yitzhak rabin foreign minister moshe 
arens and attorney general yosef harish appear before the foreign 
affairs and defense committee to explain the involvement of israelis 
in colombia 
i want to bring up the idea of reserve officers selling weapons 
and offering training he said we must certainly put limits to 
this and check and check again how they are working 
committee chairman eliahu benelissar of prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc said a hearing would be proposed for 
next week 
a foreign ministry official said privately that israel offered 
colombia all possible assistance in the struggle against drug 
traffic and asked for all information available on the involvement 
of israelis 
he said the request was made to the colombian foreign ministry by 
michael ronen charge daffaires at the israeli embassy in bogota 
israeli media said thursday that four israeli mercenaries trained 
paramilitary troops and assassination teams for drug dealers in 
central america 
drug cartel assassins killed a judge a national police colonel 
and colombias leading presidential candidate last week 
israel television and all major dailies identified the head of 
the training group as lt col yair klein 44 retired commander of 
a paratroop antiterror squad 
a government inquiry began after film was broadcast on american 
television showing an israeli officer instructing paramilitary 
personnel who worked for drug traffickers 
israeli media identified klein as the officer and said he ran hod 
hahanit which operated in south america the company is listed in 
the 1988 israel defense sales directory published by the defense 
ministry 
its advertisement which identifies klein as president says the 
firm specializes in fighting terrorism by establishing and 
training antiterror units internal security and intelligence 
forces sophisticated rescue teams presidential guard units and 
vip security 
israel television said the company began operating in colombia 
more than two years ago it said all the companys men had left the 
country and klein was expected in israel on saturday 
it said rafael eytan an israeli counterterrorism expert denied 
suggestions that he was a consultant to israeli companies operating 
in colombia and said he had cut all business ties to that country 
according to the report eytan confirmed he flew to colombia a 
week ago for private reasons 
benny tal an israeli security expert said former commandos and 
paratroopers often are recruited by drug cartels 
tal who owns a private security firm that trains bodyguards 
abroad said in an interview that israelis often go to the united 
states with dreams of making fortunes but find themselves 
unemployed 
if someone from a drug cartel comes to him and offers say 
100000 for a job hell do it tal said 
tal said israelis who train illegal paramilitary forces usually 
are offered 10000 a month paid into swiss bank accounts plus 
expenses in local currency 
israel tv quoted foreign reports about a possible involvement in 
colombia by mike harari a former chief of israeli intelligence in 
south america and a security chief for panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
harari mossads former operations chief left the intelligence 
agency after a july 1973 fiasco in norway in which his agents 
mistook a moroccan waiter for a palestinian terrorist and killed him 
israel tv quoted zvi zamir head of mossad in 19681974 as 
saying harari was not involved in military training in colombia and 
one must be insane to tie harari to drug dealings 
panamas ambassador to the united states juan sosa said on 
israel radio that harari entered the united states two weeks ago on 
a false passport and may have returned to panama

lisa mccormack says crashing an exclusive 
blacktie party in washington is easier than you think all you need 
is a tuxedo or a formal gown and plenty of chutzpah 
she ought to know even though shes never crashed a party 
herself 
as former editor of the about town society pages of the 
washington times for 5 years ms mccormack says she attended 
literally thousands of glitzy social events and interviewed 
everyone from spuds mackenzie to mother teresa 
shes shared confidences with shimon peres and francois 
mitterrand and chatted up the likes of malcolm forbes don johnson 
lee iacocca elizabeth taylor and mikhail baryshnikov her rolodex 
is crammed with unlisted phone numbers for senators foreign 
ambassadors and hollywood celebrities 
what shocked me was how easy it is to crash parties in this 
town ms mccormack said in an interview after she lectured eager 
students at the learning annex a local university without walls on 
the rules of the partycrashing game ms mccormack is now an 
investigative reporter for the times 
here is her howto guide for slipping into swank parties without 
an invitation and enjoying a free evening of booze food and 
schmoozing with bigname guests 
the toughest job is finding out where the parties are and when 
they begin she says check newspaper society columns and magazines 
for upcoming events call the big hotels they publish a detailed 
mimeographed list of future parties and banquets complete with 
names and phone numbers 
call up and say im interested in attending your party can 
you tell me who the vips are have an agenda in mind you are going 
there for a specific purpose she said 
the rest is a cinch 
if a dinner party starts at 7 oclock arrive 20 minutes late 
youll see a table at the door usually run by five women thats 
where paying guests go to check in avoid those women at all costs 
go directly to the bar start chatting in the line and get a 
drink it will help you relax and give you a chance to mix and 
mingle like me you might run into former surgeon general everett 
koop who drinks straight gin out of a glass say it isnt so i 
told him 
dinner usually starts about 830 move through the hed into the 
ballroom they will drift slowly to the tables when they finally 
sit down thats the time to leave and return to the bar for about 
20 minutes when you come back there will always be empty seats so 
just take one 
if you dont have the guts to take that empty seat just skip 
the meal which takes 50 minutes max the food is usually bad 
anyway then its a cocktail party again with talking and dancing 
walk right in and join everybody 
above all maintain a nonchalant attitude says ms mccormack 
just wave at everybody and say to yourself im here im 
cool i belong and dont freeze up 
its amazing but nobodys going to stop you either they dont 
care or theyre afraid of embarrassing themselves if they do i got 
into the inaugural galas without showing credentials with nothing 
but my ball gown i just waved and smiled at the security guards and 
walked in 
says ms mccormack anybody can do it 
she cautions against trying to crash white house state dinners 
because security is too tight to take chances 
its impossible she said

drug gangs bombed two political party 
offices thursday burned the homes of two politicians in medellin 
and declared total war on the government for cracking down on 
them one person was killed 
president virigilio barco on thursday issued a series of new 
emergency decrees that heighten the nations battle against drug 
traffickers 
the antinarcotics sweep was spurred by the assassination last 
week of luis carlos galan a leading presidential candidate who 
promised to curb drug trafficking 
the outpouring of public rage has made many colombians hope the 
battle against the cocaine barons can be won this time 
clara obregon lopez a former bogota city council member said 
the indignation is so strong that its not leaving room for 
fear she said 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the declaration of war on the colombian government certainly 
heightens the concern about security both for the colombian 
government and for ourselves 
officials say about 100 us officials are connected with the 
embassy in bogota and about two dozen drug enforcement 
administration agents are in the country the state department said 
it had no immediate plans to evacuate us personnel 
police said one person was killed in the bombing of a wing of 
liberal party offices in medellin an industrial city that serves as 
a base for a cartel believed to supply as much as 80 percent of the 
cocaine distributed in the united states 
also bombed was the conservative party headquarters police said 
the attackers set fire to the vacation homes of two prominent 
politicians former finance minister edgard gutierrez of the liberal 
party and conservative sen ignacio velez escobar 
officials said they found powerful bombs hidden in suitcases left 
at the medellin offices of two national radio networks caracol and 
radio cadena nacional the explosives were found and defused 
at the caracol station the bombers left behind a statement dated 
signed by the extraditables a group known to carry out attacks 
for the medellin cartel 
we declare total and absolute war on the government on the 
industrial and political oligarchy on the journalists that have 
attacked and ravaged us on the judges that have sold out to the 
government on the extraditing magistrates on the presidents of the 
unions and all those who who persecuted and attacked us it said 
we wont respect the families of those who have not respected 
our families it added we will burn and destroy the industries 
the properties and the mansions of the oligarchies 
the bombed liberal party offices belonged to a faction of the 
party that sponsored galans presidential candidacy the explosion 
blew in the front and part of the roof of the onestory concrete and 
brick building 
the offices director gustavo garcia said the person killed was 
a passerby 
all the attacks occurred between midnight and 4 am 
it wasnt exactly a surprise when these people make a threat 
they carry it out a senior state department official said in 
washington speaking on condition of anonymity 
barco issued decrees thursday that would oblige traffickers to 
come out of hiding to reclaim an estimated 200 million in property 
and goods confiscated in the crackdown 
they require owners to personally make claims for restitution 
barring them from using the lawyers agents and middlemen routinely 
employed by the drug kingpins 
the decrees also gave traffickers just 10 days from the seizure 
to make such claims or the state becomes the owner of the seized 
property which would be distributed among needy colombians and 
government branches 
galan a critic of colombias massive dependence on the drug 
trade was gunned down just before he was to give a campaign speech 
on friday police said drug traffickers had placed a 500000 price 
on his head 
the known leaders of the medellin cartel are pablo escobar jorge 
ochoa and gonzalo rodriguez gacha none of three was among the 
hundreds of people arrested since galans killing 
in new york gacha was indicted by a federal grand jury thursday 
on heroin importation charges 
the most prominent alleged drug figure arrested so far is eduardo 
martinez romero police and us authorities said they were trying 
to arrange speedy extradition of martinez an alleged money manager 
for the medellin cartel 
barco has established emergency procedures for extraditing 
traffickers wanted in the united states 
the supreme court nullified the extradition treaty with 
washington in june 1987 after years of intimidation of the 
judiciary at least 220 judges and other officials have been killed

international observers say the opposition won 31 the current

panamanian indian symbols shook hands with wellwishers and waved 
to the crowds but made no comment when questioned by reporters 
defense forces spokesman maj edgardo lopez grimaldo said the oas 
refusal to condemn panama was a victory for panama and a 
humiliation for the united states 
the oas exhortation for an internal solution to the countrys 
conflicts followed several visits to panama by a special mission 
that met with opposition and government leaders in an attempt to 
seek a negotiated settlement 
noriega said tuesday the political opposition committed a 
historical error when it turned down a government offer earlier 
this month to govern jointly after sept 1 
washington indicated thursday it was considering new sanctions 
against panama but officials did not say what they might be 
since february 1988 the united states has imposed economic and 
other barriers on panama including payment on panama canal tolls 
the measures have contributed to substantial economic decline in 
panama

japanese piano makers said thursday they will stop 
using imported ivory in piano keys to help protect african elephants 
the musical instrument makers said synthetic materials can 
replace the ivory preferred by many pianists because it absorbs 
perspiration from the fingers 
the measure was taken in the interest of saving elephants 
said haruo gomi a spokesman for yamaha corp japans largest 
musical instrument maker 
shigeru sugiyama spokesman of the kawai musical instruments 
mfg said his company also decided to discontinue imports of ivory 
to make piano keys 
both yamaha and kawai are based in hamamatsu central japan 
gomi said yamaha has used synthetic products to make keys of some 
expensive models for 10 years 
yamaha produces 190000 pianos a year he said and uses about 
1540 pounds of ivory to make 300350 highgrade pianos including 
its topoftheline cf3 grand that costs 44600 
gomi said the company imported about 2 tons of ivory in 1987 
enough to last three years 
in june the japanese government drastically curtailed ivory 
imports to help save african elephants from extinction among 
measures the government banned shipments of worked ivory and ivory 
scraps less than 22 pounds and under 8 inches long 
in 1988 japan imported 106 tons of unprocessed ivory and 26 tons 
of finished ivory according to government figures of the total 53 
percent of the imported ivory was used for family seals that are 
commonly used as a substitute for signatures on documents 28 
percent for jewelry 12 percent for musical instruments and the 
remaining 7 percent for art products according to the private 
conservation group traffic japan 
the african elephant population has fallen from about 15 million 
in 1978 to as few as 400000 today mostly because of poachers who 
seek the valuable tusks 
 
several western nations including the united states have banned 
the import of ivory in recent months the 102nation convention on 
international trade in endangered species will consider a worldwide 
ban on the ivory trade in october

the head of the independent electoral 
council says a shortage of money means no elections can be held in 
haiti before next year 
council president louis antoine auguste said the government has 
not allocated a budget to the ninemember board which was appointed 
in april by institutions such as the roman catholic church labor 
unions and human rights groups 
for budgetary reasons elections before the end of december are 
not feasible auguste told 150 people meeting tuesday at the city 
hall in jacmel a town on the southern coast of this caribbean 
nation of 6 million 
the council has toured rural haiti since july and expects to fix 
an election schedule by next week 
council members are asking voters whether they think national and 
local elections should be staggered or held simultaneously and 
whether 1 million haitians living abroad should be allowed to 
participate 
we are trying to set an example of democratic behavior said 
the councils general secretary jeangerard pierre 
the citizens of certain remote areas were surprised that we 
felt obligated to take account of their point of view haitians are 
not used to being consulted by authorities he said 
jacmel residents preferred elections in two stages first 
national and then local begining early next year they strongly 
favored the participation of haitians living abroad 
former ruler lt gen henri namphy dissolved the first electoral 
council in november 1987 hours after gunmen protected by soldiers 
massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and aborted what 
would have been haitis first free general elections since 
independence in 1804 
namphy accused the council of being manipulated by foreign 
powers the united states france and canada contributed most of 
its budget 
he was ousted in a september 1988 coup that brought lt gen 
prosper avril to power namphy had led a provisional government 
after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in france in 1986

president virgilio barco fired back in 
the war on drug traffickers thursday with a salvo of decrees one 
obliging them to emerge from hiding to regain an estimated 200 
million in confiscated property 
using emergency powers under a 4yearold state of siege he 
passed a decree requiring owners to personally make claims for 
restitution barring them from using the lawyers agents and 
middlemen routinely employed by drug barons 
it also gave them just 10 days from the time of seizure to make 
such claims in the event they do not the state becomes the owner 
of the confiscated property which would be distributed as follows 
ranches livestock and other rural property and goods go to the 
national agrarian fund for distribution among landless peasants 
urban property and goods go to the family welfare institute to 
help needy children and mothers 
cash automobiles and trucks go to the judicial fund to be used 
in improving working conditions for judges 
aircraft and sea vessels go to the defense ministry and to the 
air forces commercial transport business 
arms go to the defense ministry and security police 
another decree calls for an inventory of all private airstrips 
nationwide and the destruction of those whose legitimate use cannot 
be proven 
yet another is designed to ensure anonymity for supreme court 
magistrates who review these and other decrees issued in an 
unprecedented antinarcotics offensive 
the crackdown was prompted by the assassinations of a popular 
presidential candidate a police colonel and a superior court 
magistrate last week 
the offensive has included raids and seizures at more than 700 
estates businesses and other properties owned by or linked to 
colombias powerful cocaine cartels authorities estimate that 200 
million in property including mansions airplanes cars and other 
goods have been impounded 
on thursday an infuriated medellin cocaine cartel declared 
total and absolute war on the government the political 
establishment and industries in what was viewed as an obvious bid to 
pressure the government into easing up 
drug gangs bombed two political party offices on thursday and 
burned the homes of two politicians in medellin

former black panther huey newton ended his 
rebellious life with an act of defiance telling the gunman who was 
to kill him man i aint getting in your car a witness said 
police investigators continued thursday to piece together 
newtons final hours amid speculation that his history of alcohol 
and drug abuse may have contributed to his death 
the san francisco examiner reported that newton was murdered 
after an encounter in drugtorn west oakland with three exconvicts 
who were later arrested and linked to the killing but oakland 
police lt mike sims denied the report 
although family members refused to discuss newtons drug use a 
close friend said the former black panther had a history of 
substance abuse and entered a hospital treatment program in 1984 
investigators still have not identified a suspect or motive in 
tuesdays predawn shooting but they have received several accounts 
from people who saw newton in the crimeridden neighborhood several 
hours before he was slain 
weve talked to people who were with him so we have a general 
idea of his activities before he was killed sims said 
police said newton shared drinks with a friend and left a short 
time before his body was discovered at 530 am according to 
reports in thursday editions of the oakland tribune newspaper 
michelle johnson who lives across the street from where newton 
was shot on seventh street said she was awakened by loud voices on 
the street moments before she heard the gunfire that killed newton 
the san francisco chronicle reported 
johnson said she heard a brief argument and a man order someone 
apparently newton into a car 
and the last thing huey said was man i aint getting in your 
car she said it was like he was telling them do what youre 
going to do right here 
at least three shots rang out and when johnson peered out her 
window she saw newton slumped on the sidewalk 
sims confirmed that police have interviewed johnson but would not 
reveal the contents of the discussion 
newton 47 died in the same predominantly black west oakland 
neighborhood where he grew up and began organizing the panthers in 
1966 the area is now known for open dealing of crack cocaine and 
frequent violent clashes between gang members 
the neighborhoods reputation has fueled speculation that newton 
may have been there because of a drug problem but police remained 
silent on a possible motive for the slaying family members have 
declined to comment on newtons alleged drug use 
fred hiestand a close friend for 18 years and one of newton 
attorneys said the militant leader suffered from alcohol and drug 
abuse but believed newton had been clean for six months 
that doesnt mean he couldnt have fallen off the wagon said 
hiestand who last spoke with newton on friday 
newton struggled to control his substance abuse problems said 
hiestand in 1984 newton entered a treatment program at alta bates 
hospital in berkeley and fought recently to overcome his problems 
on his own hiestand said 
earlier this year newton served time in san quentin prison for a 
parole violation for possessing cocaine and drug paraphernalia 
preliminary results of an autopsy have not been released and 
findings of drug and alcohol tests are not yet available sims said 
police are also investigating a published account of newtons 
last hours by a woman who called herself pat wright which is not 
her true name said sims who refused to reveal her identity 
the woman who lives two blocks from the shooting scene and 
described herself as newtons former girlfriend said newton visited 
her late monday night and stayed until 1 am on the morning he died 
he said he was fighting a battle and he kept saying that two 
or three times she said i told him i understood but i could 
tell something was wrong he knew something was about to happen 
since the shooting the sidewalk where newton lay mortally 
wounded has become something of a shrine with flowers candles and 
a steady stream of mourners embellishing the site

campbell soup co which began making soup 
here 120 years ago will close its original plant three us 
factories and five overseas for a loss of nearly 2800 jobs the 
company said thursday 
campbell said it would keep its headquarters in this poor 
southern new jersey city on the delaware river but would move 
production at the 940employee plant to canneries in napoleon ohio 
paris texas and maxton nc the headquarters employs about 1700 
people 
the company said that as part of a worldwide restructuring it 
also plans to close a 272employee plant in pocomoke city md a 
plant employing 246 people in crisfield md and an 84employee 
plant in smyrna tenn 
the five overseas plants which employ 1200 people were not 
identified campbell said it would close the camden plant by next 
july but did not have a timetable for any of the other closings 
many employees will be offered transfers while others will be 
offered severance pay or help finding other jobs the company said 
the restructuring was approved at a board of directors meeting 
earlier thursday said spokeswoman marsha cade 
we feel that this will make campbell more efficient said ms 
cade she said the us plants being closed were older and just 
arent as efficient as they should be 
it would cost over a billion dollars to bring the camden plant 
alone up to date she said 
plants in chicago memphis mich doylestown and pottstown pa 
already have closed and campbell has sold its freshproduce 
subsidiary and ingredient plants in center and nacogdoches texas 
clayton del and cairo ga 
the company has about 100 plants around the world 60 of them in 
the united states 
campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year garnering 
about 65 percent of the 22 billion retail soup market a drop of 
about 5 percent in the past five years 
although campbell is closing the plant where it got its start in 
1869 it plans to start building a new 35 million 
200000squarefoot headquarters on the waterfront across the 
delaware from philadelphia 
campbell is very committed to camden ms cade said 
melvin randy primas mayor of this city of 85000 people 
said the announcement was not a surprise we have been trying to 
prepare for this day primas said 
the closing will have no major effect on a 500 million 
waterfront redevelopment project said thomas p corcoran executive 
director of the cooper ferry development association 
obviously its not good news for the city of camden to lose a 
large number of manufacturing jobs said corcoran plants like 
that are dinosaurs 
ms cade the restructuring resulted from a threeyear study of 
campbells plants and operations 
marvin b roffman an analyst with the brokerage firm janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia said the announcement 
constituted a statement by campbell management that were going to 
be lean and mean 
any food company who wants to be independent in the 90s had 
better be a very lowcost producer with a global presence roffman 
said 
some analysts have said campbell had too many inefficient plants 
for years john t dorrance jr the son of the inventor of 
condensed soup hesitated to lay off workers or shut down plants 
before his death in april dorrance began to see the writing on 
the wall that the food industry was moving to consolidated 
stateoftheart operations roffman said

an ugly brown barge carrying 120 tons 
of obsolete rocketlaunching structures exploded wednesday in flames 
and smoke in the atlantic ocean then sank to become an artificial 
reef 
she lived by fire and she died by fire salvage specialist 
ryan moore said after three pieces of space material and the old oil 
barge welded into a single structure were sunk 18 miles east of the 
cape canaveral space complex 
army ordnance experts used 40 pounds of plastic explosives to 
blow out the barges bottom sending it to the ocean floor 120 feet 
below 
the reef which will provide an environment for grouper snapper 
and other sea life was the culmination of a nearly twoyear effort 
by federal agencies industry environmental groups the military 
and individuals 
it consists of 
a rustred 60ton umbilical tower off launch pad 36a which 
helped launch more than 75 space flights including the 
atlascentaur series that boosted the surveyor probe to the moon 
a 40ton missile access stand from launch pad 29 which 
supported test launches of polaris and poseidon missiles 
a 10ton shuttlecentaur support stand from launch pad 36a 
the 10ton 180footlong oil barge built in the 1940s 
its great to see some of the materials once used to launch 
america into space put to good use said dave murphree of the 
florida sport fishing association which helped coordinate the 
project 
much of the estimated 40000 cost was paid for by the 
fishamerica foundation a private fishery conservation group and 
humminbird depth sounders of eufaula ala which makes sonar and 
electronic fish finders 
the barge was towed out by a barge in calm seas four ordnance 
experts set the explosives around 130 pm they set a 10minute 
timer climbed aboard a waiting speedboat and sped away from the 
barge before the charge went off 
orange and yellow flames enveloped the barge and its cargo 
about 35 feet high before a small grayandwhite mushroom cloud 
spiraled up into bright nearly cloudless skies 
as a boatload of reporters and photographers watched from a half 
mile away the structure quickly sank it was gone within two 
minutes 
we intend to support many more of these artificial reefs with 
old space material said humminbird spokesman rodney huey maybe 
our next one will have stuff thats already been in space

the brotherinlaw of former mexican president 
luis echeverria appeared thursday before a federal grand jury 
investigating the 1985 murder of us drug agent enrique camarena 
ruben zunoarce 59 a prominent mexican businessman suspected of 
involvement in drug trafficking was brought to the panels hearing 
room after being granted immunity from prosecution for anything he 
may disclose while testifying secretly 
zunoarce was arrested aug 9 in san antonio by us immigration 
agents as he tried to cross into mexico an inspector recognized 
zunoarce as one of those on a list of suspected drug traffickers 
authorities said 
his three lawyers were not permitted to be present at the secret 
proceeding but were allowed to wait in a corridor the witness had 
the right to leave the hearing room and consult with them at any 
time 
because of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings it was not 
known whether zunoarce cooperated in testifying he was granted 
use immunity after he said he would invoke fifth amendment 
protection against selfincrimination and refuse to testify 
use immunity means that he cannot be prosecuted on the basis of 
anything he says in the closed hearing 
in an unusual procedure zunoarce has been held without bail 
since he was arrested in san antonio tex on aug 9 his attorneys 
argued that he should be freed because he is not charged with any 
crime but in a hearing last friday us district judge edward 
rafeedie ruled that zunoarce is a flight risk and that he may have 
significant information about the camarena case 
he urged prosecutors to quickly obtain a grant of immunity for 
zunoarce have him appear before a grand jury and then release him 
from custody 
it was unclear how soon after his appearance thursday the witness 
could be released the 1985 kidnapping and torture murder of 
camarena and his pilot alfredo zavalaavelar became an 
international incident the drug enforcement administration has 
vowed to bring in every person involved in the murders 
several members of the mexican federal police force were linked 
to the killings and one raul lopez alvarez was convicted last year 
along with two drug traffickers 
the government wants zunoarce to testify in the trial of a 
recently charged defendant juan jose bernaberamirez a former 
member of the jalisco state judicial police 
they have linked zunoarce to the sale of a home in guadalajara 
which was subsequently bought by mexican drug lord rafael 
caroquintero authorities believe camarena was murdered at that 
house 
caroquintero who is accused of orchestrating the murders is in 
custody awaiting trial in mexico city seven more men are charged 
with murder and conspiracy in the case

the government on friday indicted kim 
daejung leader of south koreas largest opposition party and two 
lawmakers on charges of failing to report a legislators secret trip 
to communist north korea 
prosecutors issued a statement saying the three were accused of 
failing to report the visit of national assemblyman suh kyungwon to 
the north in august 1988 the statement said they would not be 
detained 
if convicted kim head of the party for peace and democracy kim 
wonki the partys parliamentary floor leader and rep lee 
chulyong could be sentenced to a maximum five years each in prison 
kim daejung who ran for president in 1971 and 1987 has 
strongly denied allegations he had anything to do with suhs trip or 
espionage and accused the government of trying to undermine his 
party 
the prosecutors office said the indictments were being sent by 
registered mail and the first court hearing probably will be held 
within a month 
suh was arrested on june 28 and charged with espionage with 
violating a ban on unauthorized travel to north korea and with 
receiving 120000 from north korean agents before and during his 
secret trip to pyongyang 
prosecutors said kim daejung would be charged with violating the 
law governing foreign exchange for allegedly receiving 10000 from 
suh who they said got the money from north korean agents 
the prosecution said kim daejung apparently did not know the 
money came from north korea so the charge was limited to a minor 
violation which says anyone receiving foreign currency must report 
it within 10 days 
in an interview on thursday kim daejung accused investigators 
of using torture tactics on suh and two of the nine others jailed 
since the case became public at the end of june 
anticipating the indictment against him kim daejung said it 
would be a turning point in south korean politics its an 
indication the roh regime has given up promises for 
democratization 
roh has introduced widespread democratic reforms since he took 
office last year but critics complain he has not done enough to 
introduce full democracy 
the presidents foes also charge that roh is reneging on his 
campaign promise to clear up misdeeds and corruption committed under 
his disgraced predecessor chun doohwan 
prosecutors say they have evidence kim daejung knew about suhs 
trip two months before the case was made public in june he denied 
it saying he learned of the trip shortly before suh turned himself 
in to authorities in late june 
suh a 52yearold farmer elected to the national assembly in 
april 1988 was expelled from the party after his trip was made 
public 
the seoul government prohibits unauthorized travel to north 
korea an enemy country since the korean peninsula was divided in 
1945 the two koreas fought a bloody war in 195053 and never signed 
a peace treaty 
kim daejung 64 spent almost seven years in prison after a 1976 
conviction on antigovernment activity and a 1980 conviction on 
sedition charges opposition supporters say these convictions were 
based on trumpedup charges by repressive governments

the national action party on thursday demanded 
an investigation of the administrators of the giant cananea 
coppermining company whose declaration of insolvency four days ago 
threw 3200 miners out of work 
its urgent and necessary to examine who is responsible for the 
bankruptcy eugenio ortiz economic affairs coordinator for the 
conservative opposition party told a news conference 
the government owns 90 percent of the openpit mine the largest 
in mexico and 10th largest in the world it sent 3000 soldiers to 
close the mine site 25 miles south of the arizona border when 
bankruptcy was declared last sunday 
the action came one week before a strike scheduled by cananea 
miners to press their demands for a 330 percent wageandbenefit 
increase mine workers earn from 3000 to 4000 per year 
the government plans to sell its share of the company to private 
interests as part of a national strategy to trim federal investment 
in mexican business 
the national action party draws its strongest support from 
northern mexico and advocates privatization of governmentowned 
industries but ortiz said we dont agree with the way theyre 
doing it 
his party says the government should let the public know what 
private investors are being considered in sales of government stock 
in the case of prospective cananea buyers they havent let the 
public know ortiz said 
national action blamed both the government and the union for the 
bankruptcy 
the mexican government is the principal responsible for the bad 
administration that sunk cananea in the inefficiency that led to 
bankruptcy it said in a news release 
union bossism is also responsible for the blunders that entered 
into the unsustainable situation that has provoked the bankruptcy of 
the cananea mining company 
since last year two deals to sell off the governments share of 
the indebted company have fallen through 
miners fought privatization and called the bankruptcy declaration 
a unionbusting tactic they blocked highways leading out of cananea 
for more than an hour on wednesday in a protest march 
national action on thursday backed miners demands for higher 
severance pay 
other opposition parties joined national action in congressional 
sessions wednesday in demanding an investigation of cananeas 
administration but the institutional revolutionary party majority 
overruled the proposition 
in elections last month national actions candidate won the 
first opposition party governorship in history in northern baja 
california

a move by five grocery chains against a 
synthetic hormone designed to boost cows milk production may help 
delay government approval for its commercial use says an 
antigenetic engineering activist 
five food chains say they are not selling milk from cows treated 
experimentally with the synthetic hormone jeremy rifkin head of 
the foundation on economic trends said wednesday 
bovine growth hormone or bgh is designed to boost cows 
production by as much as onethird 
the decision by the food companies as well as rising concerns in 
dairy states will put a lot of pressure on the food and drug 
administration to put off final approval of the hormone for general 
use rifkin said

the number of elderly people living alone will 
surge in the next century creating more demand for support services 
such as home care to help them avoid nursing homes researchers say 
the number of frail elderly elderly with health limitations 
and elderly living alone will all exceed the general increase in the 
elderly population said a report by the urban institute a 
private agency 
the elderly of the next century will have fewer children and will 
divorce or remain single more often leaving many without a 
significant caregiver and heightening their need for public and 
private services the researchers reported 
in a study titled the needs of the elderly in the 21st 
century the researchers called for efforts to help prevent people 
from becoming disabled as they age target services toward those who 
most need help and rework financing so needed services are more 
affordable for the elderly

a bank for children thinks a credit card is 
just what its kiddie customers want but one opponent says teaching 
a new generation how to borrow is the last thing this debtplagued 
country needs 
we think it teaches absolutely the wrong message said loren 
dunton president of the national center for financial education a 
nonprofit group that seeks to promote financial responsibility 
our message is to save now so you can buy later and theyre 
promoting the philosophy of buy now and pay later 
the san diegobased center plans to use its branches in 50 states 
to ask parents and teachers to oppose a plan by the young americans 
bank to provide credit cards to children ages 12 and older 
but the denverbased bank whose customers are all young people 
said it is trying to teach the proper use of credit as part of 
personal finance 
our feeling is that credit cards are really a way of life and 
a lot of us learn about credit in an undesireable way without 
any supervision or control bank president linda sanders said 
here that is done with control

when alan spencer was taking a college tv 
writing class he encountered the same frustrations many students do 
my script flunked it got like a d it was like a one day 
at a time and they said this could never sell 
and i said its on next week 
spencer by then was a veteran script writer he was selling tv 
scripts when he was 17 the only kid in high school earning 
residuals 
now at the ripe old age of 29 he quickly adds that hell be 30 
in october spencer is launching his second primetime network 
comedy nutt house premiering next month on nbc it stars 
harvey korman and cloris leachman as the respectively officious 
and bizarre staff of a large unlikely new york hotel 
spencers first show an homage to his hero mel brooks and 
brooks 1960s satirical spy comedy get smart was abcs sledge 
hammer like get smart it was heavy on inside jokes and 
physical gags 
this time around spencer is not gazing from afar but is paired 
with his idol producerdirector brooks cowrote the pilot with 
spencer and is coexecutive producer of nutt house with spencer 
and bob brunner 
spencer proclaimed in his high school yearbook that his goal in 
life was to work with mel brooks 
i dont know i just liked mel brooks humor because its 
shocking its different its outrageous it usually makes 
statements about life but i think the key thing is his goal is 
really to make you laugh spencer told an often 
laughterinterrupted session with television critics to discuss the 
new show 
nutt house will join nbcs wednesday lineup well matched 
with its leadin the broadly comic night court the pilot that 
was screened for the critics was wildly slapstick and spencer said 
portions would be reshot and toned down to develop the characters 
and emotional story a little more 
but spencer hopes the show will mark a return to physical and 
visual comedy on television that brooks has produced to such effect 
in films such as young frankenstein and high anxiety 
spencer acknowledges it will be hard to do a highstandard kind of 
featurelevel comedy week after week 
he added i watch a lot of marx brothers movies and things to 
get the inspiration 
brooks will not be involved in the daytoday production of the 
show but will serve as shepherd spencer said the show will 
however reflect brooks comedy philosophy be savage against 
those in authority and be kind to those underneath it that suffer 
from it spencer said 
the shooting of the nutt house pilot gave spencer the 
opportunity to go to the studio with brooks instead of sneaking 
onto a studio lot to see him as he used to do explaining to studio 
guards that he was brooks son 
i went up to him on the set of young frankenstein he was 
directing and i said are you busy i said i wanted some advice 
on how to get into comedy writing thats the first time i met him 
i remember all these things you know go away you know 
spencer did manage to work for brooks eventually writing 
punchup jokes for brooks last tv comedy the shortlived robin 
hood satire when things were rotten 
spencer said brooks was a fan of sledge hammer which went 
off the air two seasons ago after a twoseason run so when disney 
offered a hotel set from the feature film big business for use 
as a television show set brooks called spencer 
now theyre pals 
you honestly wish you could have a film camera just film a day 
with him because theres so many things that get lost spencer 
said we were driving along once because wed always go to these 
lunches at this deli and there was this man hitchhiking and it 
looked like hed killed his whole family he had like chains on 
and a torn tshirt and drooling and everything and he had his thumb 
out and mel looked at him and went the height of optimism

only one alabama city still clings to a city 
commission form of government elected atlarge a system once 
commonplace but now mostly dismantled in what one scholar calls the 
souths second reconstruction 
but change may come to the holdout muscle shoals a federal 
judge is considering whether to order the creation of seven voting 
districts that could bring the first black into office in the city 
which is about 10 percent black 
similar rulings swept the state because of litigation prompted by 
the 1965 voting rights act the major victim of the lawsuits was the 
atlarge commission form of government viewed as a bastion of white 
political power because blacks seeking representation from their 
areas were outvoted by the white majority 
there still are some atlargeelected councils but only one such 
city commission county commissions and school boards did not escape 
restructuring either of the 67 county commissions only a handful 
are elected atlarge most in northern alabama where there are fewer 
blacks the pattern applies to the 67 county school boards and the 
three city systems huntsville jacksonville and scottsboro that 
elect their boards the other 62 boards are appointed 
it amounts to a second reconstruction said chandler 
davidson a political sociologist at rice university referring to 
the reconstruction era after the civil war davidson testified in 
many federal hearings on lawsuits challenging the atlarge method of 
electing city officials in many cities 
davidson and other political scientists will meet thursday in 
atlanta to discuss the full impact of the voting rights act on the 
south 
one of the most farreaching lawsuits stemming from the act was 
filed in the late 1970s against mobile which davidson ranked among 
the most segregated cities in the country in terms of jobs 
education housing and politics 
bolden vs city of mobile paved the way for a 1982 amendment to 
the voting rights act eliminating the need to prove intentional 
discrimination in efforts to change atlarge election systems that 
perpetuated white dominance no longer could allwhite governments 
defend atlarge election systems by saying simply that the intent of 
the system had nothing to do with racial discrimination 
mobile changed from a city commission elected citywide to a 
mayor and a council chosen from seven districts three blacks were 
elected 
the 1982 amendment ended cities resistance to racial change and 
it didnt go unnoticed that mobiles legal bill was over 1 million 
soon the financial burden and the increasing likelihood of 
courtroom defeat moved scores of local governments to change 
the commission form of government is history said tuscaloosa 
city attorney bob ennis you can no longer have a form of 
government that is not constantly aware of how cities operate on a 
daily basis tuscaloosa settled a voting rights lawsuit quickly 
six years ago switching to a mayor and council 
were constantly aware of the voting rights act every time 
theres an annexation redistricting or substantive change ennis 
said 
there are 440 cities in the state with an average of five 
council districts each some 410 council members are now blacks and 
there are 31 black mayors said the alabama democratic conference a 
black political caucus there were 12 black mayors and 94 black 
council members in 1979 
however changes in city hall dont necessarily reflect changed 
cities 
if you travel across the black belt now what you will find 
more often than not is a courthouse controlled by blacks surrounded 
by white merchants who control everything else and they are hardly 
speaking said selma lawyer jl chestnut a veteran of 
changeofgovernment lawsuits 
so we have to take into consideration questions beyond the mere 
political consequences of an election arrangement chestnut said 
us district judge myron thompson is considering a lawsuit that 
could lead to change for a handful of cities that still have 
atlarge elections including muscle shoals which has never had a 
black on its threemember city commission the lawsuit began with 
some 150 cities as defendants but more than half have made changes 
that satisfied the courts and black voters who filed it 
some black belt cities in western alabama were forced to 
change through state legislation each has unique circumstances and 
most officials report political acceptance of choosing council 
members from districts 
brundidge a mostly black city of 3300 last year gave up its 
commission in favor of a mayorcouncil system you have more input 
under this system a good racial and income mix said mayor james 
t ramage iii who is white 
gadsden mayor david nolen believes that residents of his city of 
47000 which is 25 percent black would return to a citywide system 
if given a choice the mayorcouncil system adopted in 1986 because 
of a lawsuit has been typified by bickering between the mayor 
and council members he said there are two blacks on the 
sevenmember council 
some smaller cities remain unaffected mainly because of their 
low percentage of blacks in arab an allwhite city of 6600 city 
attorney dave beuoy said the mayor and five council members are 
still elected atlarge 
such cities with few blacks like muscle shoals pose a delicate 
problem 
small municipalities are viewed by many whites as their last 
sanctuary and if were going to have viable working relationships 
across racial lines we have to be careful how we go about these 
things chestnut said 
birmingham voted out the city commission in 1962 though the 
current ninemember city council now majority black remains 
elected citywide however a federal judge is weighing a proposal to 
switch to election from districts six black and three white 
after a group of whites filed a reversediscrimination lawsuit 
claiming the white vote was diluted by citywide elections 
birmingham is waiting for a ruling from us district judge 
robert propst before proceeding with october elections said city 
attorney jim baker this is the only case filed by whites i know 
of

after 20 years of watching congress fail to 
balance the federal budget you might be forgiven for believing it 
cannot be done but budgets can be balanced and the evidence is 
hard to ignore 
that evidence in the very period in which the federal government 
has failed the states as a whole repeatedly have finished the 
fiscal year with a cumulative net surplus 
they have done it with relatively simple tools fortynine of the 
states have balancedbudget requirements 43 states give the 
governor lineitem veto power and 26 states have tax and 
expenditure limitations 
federal lawmakers have passed over this evidence says steven 
moore who earns his professional credits analyzing such matters if 
they paid attention he says they would learn two additional things 
1 the federal budget deficit crisis is unlikely to be resolved 
by further increases in taxes at the state level higher tax 
revenues have generally encouraged even greater spending 
2 raising taxes could sound the death knell to americas 
sevenyear economic expansion theres plenty of statelevel 
evidence that raising taxes undermines the economy 
moore who studies federal budgetary matters for the heritage 
foundation a conservative think tank claims states that restrain 
taxes generally achieve more rapid growth in income jobs and 
business investment than their highertaxed neighbors 
to illustrate the economies of arizona california and until 
recently massachusetts surged during the 1980s after they cut 
taxes sharply conversely three of the slowest growing states 
iowa west virginia and wyoming substantially raised taxes in the 
same period 
additional evidence 
the national economic expansion since 1983 has yielded revenue 
windfalls for the treasuries of most state governments the states 
benefiting most from the burgeoning national economy have been those 
in the northeast 
in this region personal income grew about four times faster than 
in the nation as a whole between 1978 and 1987 and unemployment at 
the end of 1988 was about 25 percent these states should be among 
the most fiscally sound 
sad but not true says moore the northeast states are facing a 
severe fiscal crisis and several might be in the red in the next 
year their good fortune sent them off on a spending spree 
such a process is insidious suggests moore higher revenues 
trigger new spending the new spending items become politically 
indispensable fixtures and cannot be cut as budget balances 
deteriorate pressures mount for higher taxes taxes are raised and 
the slowing economy becomes slower 
based on his and other studies moore contends incomes grow 
fastest in lowtax states employment grows fastest in lowtax 
states and rising state taxes deter business investment the latter 
he says managed to end the socalled massachusetts miracle as 
taxes rose per capita income plunged 
federal lawmakers have ignored the evidence passing no less than 
13 tax increases since 1982 that have brought federal state and 
local tax receipts to onethird of gross national product a crisis 
nears says moore 
washington he concludes should take a tip from the states not 
only about the damage that is selfinflicted by raising taxes but 
about the means to bringing expenditures into line with revenues 
theres no mystery he says

when some actors tire of filmmaking they take a 
break not michael caine he turns to television movies instead 
thisll save people saying oh he made another movie the 
56yearold actor said as he joked about his prolific celluloid 
output 
he was talking on a break in filming dr jekyll and mr hyde 
the latest film version of robert louis stevensons 1886 horror 
classic others have starred john barrymore 1921 frederic march 
1931 and spencer tracy 1941 
it is caines second victorianera tv melodrama in two years 
jack the ripper was aired last october 
the twohour 63 million dr jekyll and mr hyde 
costarring cheryl ladd and written and directed by david wickes is 
to be shown early next year on abc in the united states and around 
christmas in britain on the independent television network 
the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde as the novel was 
titled tells of kindly dr jekyll who experiments with chemical 
changes in his body believing he can distill the good in himself 
from the evil the evil persona whom he names mr hyde gradually 
takes over and commits murder the book ends with jekylls suicide 
caine sees the story as one man fighting a battle against 
himself 
hes always fighting the evil within him he said in an 
interview when hes jekyll hes never evil and when hes evil 
hes a monster he turns into this thing once ive got hydes 
mask on im not mr sympathy believe me 
the producers wont reveal what hyde looks like but promise hell 
be terrifying they use modern makeup techniques devices and 
effects unknown to barrymore when he played the role in a silent 
movie 68 years ago 
ladd plays sara crawford sister of jekylls dead wife who falls 
for jekyll and discovers too late the hyde that lurks beneath 
crawford is wickes invention one of several departures from the 
original story which the director said needed shaking up 
the book is told secondhand by this lawyer as a retelling of 
what happened some years back said wickes also theres no 
female interest at all i invented cheryls character as my ideal 
girl that is to say tough and feminine all at once 
ladd best known as one of tvs charlies angels said she 
was drawn to the project by the prospect of working with her academy 
awardwinning costar 
michael is just sensational she said keeping an eye on her 
14yearold daughter jordan who appears in the restaurant scene as 
an extra he makes me laugh all the time hes very funny 
caine said the movie gives him a part he could never get to do on 
the big screen i thought when else am i going to get a chance 
to play jekyll and hyde theyre not going to do it in movies 
again 
the story has been filmed often march won an oscar for his 
version a decade after barrymores it was remade 10 years later 
with tracy and ingrid bergman a movie now shown on television with 
washedout tints in a colorized version 
caine said he likes the priorities of tv filming the great 
thing is they concentrate on the actor its your performance 
theyre shooting and you dont have to wait for the cavalry to come 
over the hill for an hour before they shoot your closeup 
i like that because im lazy and i only work well under 
pressure 
however hes not forsaking the large screen he has just 
finished shock to the system which he describes as a comic 
nightmare swoozie kurtz and elizabeth mcgovern costar under jan 
eglesons direction next hes in bullseye opposite fellow 
briton roger moore of james bond fame 
born maurice micklewhite caine shot to fame in 1966 as the 
cockney philanderer in alfie a master of character acting he 
has won acclaim as the drunken professor in educating rita as 
the unfaithful husband in hannah and her sisters which won him 
an academy award and most recently as a con artist in dirty 
rotten scoundrels 
he recently signed to write his autobiography for random house 
and thinks director wickes may already have provided a title 
instead of saying cut print he always says been there 
done that said caine that might be a good title

in coming months congress must decide whether 
the b2 stealth bomber the most expensive plane ever designed 
and built is a weapon the united states cant afford to do without 
or simply cant afford yet for all the secrecy surrounding this 
hightech marvel the ideas behind it are by aviation standards 
almost ancient history 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it rests in pieces in a grimy corner of a 
museum warehouse in suburban silver hill md long forgotten by the 
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable 
bomber in the skies 
reassembled it would look like a huge vampire bat or a 
stubtailed manta ray underlying its design was the notion that the 
enemy wouldnt see it at all because this jetpowered flying wings 
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves 
rather than reflect them 
no the northrop b2 bomber the worlds most expensive airplane 
hasnt already become a dustgathering relic although some 
critics convinced the albatross is the only seacreature to which 
it should be compared wish that were so 
the astonishing lookalike in silver hill is indeed a stealth 
warplane but it was secretly built and testflown 45 years ago by 
nazi germany 
for all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word stealth 
since it was introduced to the us military vocabulary in 1980 the 
b2 and such radarevading relatives as the f117a fighter represent 
concepts which by aviation standards are almost ancient 
the b2 has been financed until this year out of the pentagons 
mysterious black budget for eight years the taxpayers spent 
224 billion without knowing it and without knowing what they were 
getting for it 
what they got when it was finally nosed heavenward in july was 
a strange plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably 
wont fly much higher much farther or any faster than the strategic 
air commands old reliable the b52 
the b2 is 17 feet tall 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172 
feet it is powered by four general electric f118 engines 
virtually the same engines as used on the f14 fighter but without 
afterburners its range is 6900 miles without refueling and 11500 
miles with one midair refueling it will have a maximum takeoff 
weight of 350000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50000 pounds of 
bombs or missiles nuclear or conventional 10000 pounds less than 
the b52 private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to 
55000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 08 to 085 or about 530560 
mph 
theres nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers 
what is dazzling presumably is the stuff the air force wont talk 
about the stealth technology computerized flight controls 
quiet onboard radar and other electronic systems possibly 
employing fiber optics designed to withstand the electromagnetic 
interference generated by nuclear blasts 
the air force wants to spend an additional 50 billion or so to 
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company northrop which for 
years hadnt made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter the 
f5 
former pentagon procurement chief robert b costello who left as 
undersecretary of defense in may wanted to scuttle the program in 
an interview with the washington post he said he told thendefense 
secretary frank carlucci last year that its being brought to you 
by the same company that brought you a series of troubled 
programs including guidance systems for the mx and airlaunched 
cruise missiles what makes you think theyll do better with the 
b2 
eight days after the b2s maiden flight july 17 pentagon and 
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by 
the justice departments fraud unit concerning northrops billing 
practices on the project the company said it was unaware of the 
probe 
northrop chairman thomas v jones says without reservation that 
the b2 is an extraordinary success defense secretary richard 
b cheney calls it absolutely vital to strategic deterrence 
president bush says doing without it would be devastating to 
armscontrol negotiations with the soviets 
the security and secrecy surrounding the project have been 
phenomenal perhaps rivaled only by elements of the star wars 
program and the manhattan project that developed the atomic bomb in 
world war ii northrop removed it from the rest of its own 
organization forming a new division called advanced products and 
housing it at a closed auto plant in pico rivera calif it 
surrounded the plant as well as the sister assembly complex at 
palmdale calif with fences topped by razor wire 
according to costello security has accounted for 5 percent of 
the costs to date with more than 224 billion spent so far that 
amounts to more than 1 billion 
the tight security imposed additional costs efficiency suffered 
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didnt know 
what their subordinates were doing i couldnt even ask one 
former northrop official told the los angeles times last year for 
all i knew they were going to the movies every day 
some could have when employees were hired they could not go 
directly to work until their security clearances were finished many 
were assigned for weeks to makework jobs in an area of the plant 
they nicknamed the drunk tank 
unbeknownst to the public the biggest snag occurred halfway 
through the sevenyear design period when the air force changed its 
mind about the b2s mission the pentagon originally ordered a 
highaltitude bomber now it wanted one that could penetrate at low 
levels as well probably because it was fearful the soviet union was 
developing the same new radar technology called othb for over the 
horizon backscatter the still supersecret radar system the 
pentagon has privately acknowledged offers new possibilities for 
detecting stealth airplanes though it is said to be ineffective 
within 500 miles 
northrops designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower 
altitudes where turbulence is greater that took a year and another 
1 billion an additional sixmonth delay was necessary for other 
design changes related especially to the engine inlets in 1987 
two years before congress began public debate over funding for the 
b2 the pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years 
in the face of grammrudman budget restrictions cheney has 
postponed production yet another year the pentagon now hopes to 
build all 132 planes by 1999 versus the original target of 1995

in 1986 thensecretary of defense caspar weinberger offered no 
hint of the design delays and escalating costs when he testified 
before congress that the program is on schedule the technology is 
wellunderstood and working and we expect the system to be 
operational in the early 1990s 
weinberger was also far off the mark when he offered congress the 
first public figures about the planes cost the b2 he said would 
cost 277 million for each plane and the entire program would tally 
about 366 billion just two years later the pentagon went back to 
congress weeks before the b2s first test flight with figures 
roughly doubling weinbergers 530 million per plane total program 
cost of more than 70 billion 
with those numbers now out in the open some in congress are 
questioning whether the united states can afford the plane that gen 
bernard p randolph head of the air force systems command calls 
nothing less than a quantum leap into the 21st century 
for all the secrecy surrounding the b2s hightech features 
there is no dark secret about either the stealth concept itself or 
the flyingwing design each is nearly as old as powered flight 
simply put the stealthiness of an airplane or any other weapons 
system is measured by its ability to thwart an enemys capacity to 
detect it by whatever means it is a matter of degree there is no 
such thing as total stealth pure invisibility remains the exclusive 
domain of science fiction 
hauptmann petrocz von petroczy probably qualified as the inventor 
of the stealth airplane when at a time when the unaided human eye 
was the principal aerial tracking device he removed the fabric 
covering of an etrich taube monoplane and replaced it with 
transparent celluloid the engine and skeleton still showed but 
residents of the austrian countryside had to strain to make out the 
wraithlike source of the noise generated by petroczys test flights 
that was in 1912 two years before an englishman john w dunne 
took to the skies in an airplane with no tail no fuselage the 
first flying wing aircraft designers from hugo junkers to john w 
northrop have been entranced by its possibilities despite repeated 
setbacks ever since

the first stealth test of northrops 
flyingwing jet bomber was a remarkable success trouble was four 
decades ago nobody much cared 
shortly before the air force canceled its order for the strange 
yb49 the late 1940s forerunner to the b2 northrop test pilot max 
skelton flew a grand tour of air defense stations in the west 
nobody found him until he was directly overhead says 
flyingwing historian tim wooldridge of the national air and space 
museum so even then the air force knew that that kind of 
airplane was difficult to detect the sad part is that they didnt 
continue the testing 
eventually the lesson began to take hold though the air force 
still wouldnt bring itself to embrace the flyingwing design for 
decades speed and manueverability remained paramount objectives 
through the 1950s and 60s though stealthiness gradually moved 
higher on the priority list 
despite representations of the b2 and its fighter counterpart 
the f117a as the only stealth aircraft in the world the 
antiradar technology has been honed and shared by many other planes 
in the us arsenal some of which remain even more secret than the 
b2 itself the aging u2 spy plane and its successor the sr71 
blackbird featured composite coatings the b1 and the f117a 
represent advances in wing and body blending as well as the 
radarabsorbent materials on their skins 
contrary to popular belief the marriage of stealth technology 
with the flying wing with its slender and hence naturally stealthy 
profile also goes back decades dating almost to the birth of radar 
sir robert watsonwatt the british radar pioneer said as early 
as 1935 that the aerial defense applications of his new technology 
could be stymied by future bombers designed to reduce their radar 
reflectivity he and other engineers recognized that stealth would 
have not so much to do with the size of the airplane but with its 
shape and the materials used to cover it 
in world war ii as the united states and great britain 
aggressively improved radar technology german scientists led the 
way in exploring methods to counter it including coatings designed 
to absorb rather than reflect radar energy these radarabsorbent 
materials or ram for short were first used to shield the snorkels 
of german submarines from detection by radarequipped aircraft too 
late really the engineers turned their attention to their own 
aircraft 
almost by happenstance britain had already delivered a painful 
lesson to the third reich about bombers and stealth technology 
early in the war the tiny de havilland company had answered the 
panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a 
cheap twoengine machine out of plywood spruce and balsa it was 
initially scoffed at but the mosquito which carried nary a 
defensive gun had the lowest loss rate of any world war ii bomber 
thanks to its speed flying altitude and the nearly invisible 
flicker it produced on radar screens 
that lesson in mind the brothers walter and reimar horten 
working with a supersecret luftwaffe group known as sonderkommando 
9 set out to build a supermosquito one even stranger in design 
they came up with a flying wing powered by two jet engines buried 
behind the cockpit but too late the hoix the only prototype to 
fly in early 1945 was destroyed when one of the engines failed a 
neverflown copy rests at the national air and space museums 
storage complex at silver hill md 
it is a remarkably cleanlooking airplane says wooldridge a 
museum official and the author of winged wonders the story of 
flying wings 
the test models were covered with plywood but production 
versions were to have a skin mixing plywood sawdust charcoal and 
glue a compound expressly intended to absorb radar waves the 
hortens had built a highloadbearing plane combining jet power the 
lowprofile shape of the flying wing and integral ram it was the 
b2 of its day 
more frightening to contemplate is how the war might have turned 
if germany had managed to deploy a larger model that the hortens had 
actually started to assemble in april 1945 the hoxviii it was an 
enormous sixjet flyingwing bomber designed to fly at least 7400 
miles with an 8000pound bombload were it not for hitlers 
imminent defeat that aircraft rivaling the size of the b2 might 
have flown to bomb new york city or washington 
unlike germanys rocket scientists the horten brothers were 
rebuffed in their bid to pursue their breakthroughs for the allies 
after the war most us warplane manufacturers focused on the 
obvious alternatives to stealth for making their craft less 
vulnerable more speed higher altitudes heavier armor and 
onboard defenses 
meanwhile jack northrop the founder and longtime design leader 
of the california company that bears his name waged a lonely 
campaign for something entirely different though the horten 
brothers headed for virtual exile in argentina would not have 
thought it so

aircraft designer jack northrops dream for more 
than three decades was a jet that would combine the flying wing 
design with stealth technology making it virtually impossible 
for enemy radar to detect the b2 stealth bomber flew its maiden 
voyage this summer and the pending decision on whether to begin 
fullscale production will help determine the face of american air 
power into the next century 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jack northrop the aircraft designer and 
founder of the california company bearing his name was obsessed 
with the flying wing but for more than three decades the air force 
shunned it as a flight of fancy 
then in the end it embraced northrops dream to build the b2 
stealth bomber the worlds most expensive airplane at current 
estimates of 530 million apiece 
now congress must decide whether the united states can afford to 
build a plane the military says it cant afford to do without 
northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of the 
flying wing chiefly its reduced liklihood of being detected by 
radar as a side benefit a nice selling point to the military for 
what he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane a 
flying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventional 
airplane of the same weight it therefore is more efficient meaning 
it requires less power and less fuel and can carry a greater 
payload 
any reasonable assumptions northrop said in 1947 will 
always result in advantage to the allwing configuration of such 
magnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations may 
be involved in its development 
in 1981 as the headlines focused on ronald reagans resurrection 
of the b1 program canceled by jimmy carter jack northrop then 
retired and near death was given a special security clearance so 
pentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34 
years earlier the air force had finally contracted with the company 
bearing his name to build a flying wing as the nations flagship 
strategic bomber 
long before the public got its first glimpse of the b2 air 
force chief of staff larry welch declared that the aerodynamic 
design is markedly more efficient than that of its 
predecessors the b2 he continued requires far fewer tankers 
and carries a very healthy bomb load it would be a superb 
bomber even if it werent stealthy 
aside from military considerations some aviation buffs are 
rooting for full development and production of the b2 because of 
its potential spinoffs for commercial flight according to tim 
wooldridge of the national air and space museum airlines and air 
transport companies have long flirted with the notion of an allwing 
design for spanloaders that could fly tremendous distances 
carrying huge weights oil for example but nobodys willing to 
bet the billions of dollars it would cost for feasibility 
research he notes what airline would bet that kind of money 
to some in congress the billions that will be needed to build a 
fleet of b2s look like a questionable bet as well 
by current estimates each one will cost about 530 million put 
another way a single b2 will cost 100 million more than torontos 
spectacular skydome the worlds newest and fanciest sports stadium 
replete with hotel restaurants and retractable roof the extra 100 
million would buy a major league baseball team 
the department of defense has produced a b2 program that wont 
fly financially said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee members of congress are balking at 
spending 41 billion this year for the strategic defense 
initiative it is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much 
per year on a plane 
this was the worst kind of public policy said rep john r 
kasich rohio to keep something secret all this time and drive 
the cost up to 22 billion to date will never be tolerated again 
the air force rejects such criticism suggesting that some 
members of congress are being coy with their constituents now that 
the cost estimates are public after eight years of topsecret 
development the charge that someone was hiding anything from the 
congress is ludicrous said larry welch the air force chief of 
staff there were dozens and dozens of people in the congress who 
were fully aware of all the details 
but rep myke synar dokla said i attended classified 
briefings by the air force and by northrop which frankly left a lot 
to be desired they were not straightforward they were not candid 
and in many ways they were very confusing 
synar charged that northrop had miserably failed to manage this 
program former pentagon procurement chief robert b costello 
agreed saying he had serious and grave concerns about 
northrops management and that the firms quality controls were 
terrible 
northrops chairman thomas v jones vigorously defended the 
company and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders saying the 
program had produced an extraordinary new aircraft system and 
unprecedented technical successes 
the nations first b2 bomber made its public debut this summer 
18 months later than scheduled it taxied slowly from its hanger at 
northrops plant in palmdale calif and turned onto runway 04 the 
morning of july 17 chief northrop test pilot bruce j hinds who 
hadnt been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for the 
honor ran up the planes four general electric engines and released 
the brakes at 936 am edt twentythree seconds later the b2 was 
airborne 
the aircraft was very stable rock stable hinds reported 
later its going to be a very easy airplane to fly 
but not to sell before the august congressional recess the 
house limited b2 production to two planes next year and two the 
year after that half what the bush administration wants it also 
ordered the pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper production 
program the senate was kinder it trimmed only 300 million from 
the 47 billion sought by the president for the b2 next year a 
compromise bill may be crafted next month 
meanwhile the air force has scrambled to redefine the b2s 
mission and capability originally conceived as a purely strategic 
bomber to seek out and destroy the soviet unions mobile missiles in 
a nuclear war it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfire 
weapon as well 
gen bernard p randolph head of the air force systems command 
argues that the b2 would have been ideal had it been available 
for the 1986 us raid on libya just three to four b2s could 
have done the job directly from stateside bases randolph said 
thats a remarkable switch in air force thinking when the raid 
was planned by a young marine lieutenant colonel named oliver north 
he inquired about having the already operational f117a stealth 
fighterbomber do the job according to sweetman 
the air force turned north down cold saying the plane was too 
valuable to risk on such a venture 
the question arises if that is true of the f117 thought to 
cost about 100 million per plane why wouldnt it be true of the 
b2 at more than half a billion dollars

colstrip mont spends 5148 per pupil the districts 
6yearold high school is flush with computers uptodate labs 
even a greenhouse and indoor pool 
this eastern montana district with a tax base enriched by the 
presence of four power plants offers high school pupils several 
foreign languages and such electives as zoology microbiology and 
geology 
superior in the western end of the state spends about 3000 
per pupil the newest school building is 28 years old there are no 
science electives beyond basic biology chemistry and physics in 
labs described as woefully inadequate by former superintendent 
william donahue 
indoor swimming pools or greenhouses like in colstrip 
those would be dreams said donahue 
such contrasts between rich and poor districts endemic to 
virtually every state put school finance at the top of the 
education reform agenda this past year 
as 43 million children prepare for a new school year an 
associated press survey found 11 states defending against lawsuits 
brought by parents or school districts challenging the 
constitutionality of school funding systems systems that critics 
have long held discriminate against those living in communities with 
lower property tax revenues 
while many people talk about the importance of educational 
reform children in lowwealth districts would be helped a lot just 
to be brought to where highspending districts now are said 
arthur wise a school finance expert at the rand corporation a 
washington thinktank 
states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school 
finance are alaska connecticut indiana kentucky minnesota 
montana new jersey north dakota oregon tennessee and texas 
a coalition of poor alabama districts says it will probably sue 
that state this fall 
in florida 22 districts sued the state in 1986 the state won a 
summary judgment in 1987 
montana under court order since february to reform its funding 
system held a special legislative session this summer which 
boosted state education spending by 61 million but which critics 
say failed to solve the equity problems 
oklahoma legislators likewise met in special session this summer 
to consider sweeping proposals by gov henry bellmon that would 
substitute income and other taxes for much of the school property 
tax they recessed last week without taking action 
the equity issue has reasserted itself in the school reform 
agenda this year for several reasons chiefly many state funding 
systems are simply outofdate formulated in the early 1970s during 
the last great wave of school finance reform 
in many states you have a finance system dating from the early 
1970s you still have that system in 1989 when the school 
expectations the demographics and the economics are all different 
you can take me to any state from michigan to iowa to montana and i 
could tell you that same story said kent mcguire who follows such 
money matters for the education commission of the states in denver 
and school reform with its mandates requiring rich and poor 
districts alike to fund smaller classes higher teacher pay and 
other costly measures has pushed many small taxpoor districts to 
their financial limits 
its clear that as the reform agenda moves on thats anted up 
the cost mcguire said 
in many states the school finance issue is pitting rural 
districts with poor tax bases against bigger wealthier ones with 
farm values declining and fewer children interested in pursuing 
agricultural careers the quality of schools in rural districts has 
become a more urgent concern 
in north dakota nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit 
in june claiming the states system of providing aid to schools is 
unconstitutional 
a school districts ability to finance eduction is unfairly and 
inequitably linked to its property wealth said calvin rolfson a 
bismarck attorney representing the plaintiffs 
in texas where a lawsuit brought by a group of smaller districts 
is pending before the state supreme court lead attorney al kauffman 
said they have no chemistry no physics no calculus foreign 
language prekindergarten or college prep no extracurricular no 
band choir football no debate they have 96 percent lowincome 
students those students are not being given a chance in this 
society 
weve managed to just squeak by year after year said antonio 
parra a spokesman for the san elizario school district but 
taxpayers in our school district will probably face another tax 
increase how long can you stretch a rubber band 
in connecticut oregon and new jersey by contrast the poor 
children suing the state live in metro areas 
the nonprofit education law center in a suit on behalf of 20 
schoolaged children in camden irvington east orange and jersey 
city nj won its first victory last summer when administrative 
law judge steven lefelt ruled that the 1975 state formula for 
funding public education has failed and is unconstitutional 
in a scathing ruling lefelt found that poorer urban districts 
are overcrowded have fewer teachers poor equipment decaying 
buildings and more limited course offerings than wealthy suburban 
districts 
state education commissioner saul cooperman has rejected those 
findings as has gov thomas h kean who dismissed lefelts ruling 
as an interesting liberal treatise the state supreme court is 
scheduled to hear arguments sept 25 
in connecticut where the state is being sued by a group of urban 
schoolchildren and parents assistant superintendent daniel shamas 
in bridgeport said his district fights a constant budget battle 
bridgeport spends 5431 per year on each of its 19270 students 
affluent westport just 10 miles away spends 8299 per pupil 
if you look at the state as a whole you see two 
connecticuts one rich and one poor shamas said if you look at 
what were spending per pupil and what other more wealthy towns 
are spending that tells the whole story 
westport schools comptroller frederick j nigri rejects the 
argument that rich and poor towns offer substantially different 
educational opportunities 
for the basic educational program a child can get a great deal 
out of a bigcity system if theyre motivated nigri said we 
may have some better enrichment programs perhaps a little better 
drama program but i like to think theres some education equality 
while not yet the subject of a lawsuit in michigan school 
finance has become one of that states thorniest issues after 
failing to solve the problem the legislature has placed two 
competing referendums for voters to decide in november one would 
raise some 400 million in school funds with a sales tax hike the 
other would hike sales taxes by 468 million but offer 13 billion 
in propertytax relief 
there has never been a time that ive been told by the 
districts and educators that weve provided enough money said ken 
nelson a legislator in minnesota where 48 school districts have 
filed suit claiming that states funding formula is unfair nobody 
knows what really is enough money thats a judgment call

under the manhattan skyline below times square 
directly south of the world trade center lies a world of which most 
new yorkers remain blissfully unaware until disaster strikes 
last weekends gramercy park steam pipe blast that killed three 
people focused attention on the world beneath manhattan where 
rivers run through ancient pipes kilowatts crackle across a vast 
net of lines and the homeless find refuge from the winter freeze 
its hard to determine what happened nobody really knows what 
goes on under there said tina casey spokeswoman for the city 
department of environmental protection as officials searched for a 
cause in the fatal explosion 
consider whats down there and you can see why shes right 
on any given day more people ride beneath manhattan than reside 
atop it 3 million people ride the subway 108000 travel under the

manhattan runs over under and alongside 2146 miles of subway 
tunnels thousands of ta workers spend their days and nights 
underground keeping the system running the lirr metronorth 
amtrak new jersey transit and the path systems all face similar 
tasks on a smaller scale 
it really is astounding if you ever took a tour theres 
tunnels walkways a small train used to deliver gloria 
vanderbilts luggage beneath the waldorfastoria said dan 
brucker spokesman for metronorth railroad which operates on 48 
acres under grand central station 
its unbelievable theres literally an entire world going 
around down there 
a world with an assortment of oddities including 
two multimillion dollar subway tunnels that have never seen a 
single train or commuter both beneath second avenue 
a halfdozen abandoned train stations one of them outside city

problems water main breaks 604 in the year ending june 30 subway 
derailments nine this year down from a high of 21 in 1981 
blackouts last biggie 1977 
the likelihood of such events is a constant worry in part due to 
the age of the unseen city half the water system made mostly of 
cast iron was installed near the turn of the century some 
telephone wires date to the roaring 20s the oldest gas and 
electric lines were put in during world war ii 
and each affects whatevers nearby this downunder domino effect 
crippled a 20block section of the garment district in the summer of 
1983 when a 12inch water main burst beneath herald square spewing 
water into a power substation and igniting an underground inferno 
the area including macys and gimbels was blacked out for 
three days the potential for disaster is worse the largest water 
mains in service measure 72 inches across 
last year a main laid in 1898 ruptured flooding columbus circle 
near central park and knocking out train service for 200000 
commuters this year several thousand commuters were trapped 
underground when an emergency cord was yanked on a subway and trains 
backed up for hours 
for some new yorkers the labyrinth of twisting tunnels provides 
a temporary home beneath grand central where some of the citys 
thousands of homeless people seek relief from the elements are 56 
miles of steam pipes and 34 miles of tunnel running three levels 
deep 
metronorth police patrol the stations underbelly but rarely 
find such people said brucker 
the only thing you find down there in great numbers he said 
is rats 
not exactly theres gold under the streets in five years the 
city has collected 132 million in tax assessments on underground 
vaults once used to store coal in manhattan and brooklyn the swiss 
bank corp keeps billions in bullion in its vaults in lower 
manhattan 
the city runs deepest where it stands tallest beneath the 
110story twin towers of the world trade center down there 
restaurants including the elegant windows on the world prepare 
food the port authority police take target practice all 1452 of 
them each year and trucks make deliveries via the old path train 
tunnels 
welcome to the catacombs said a smiling carl durr whos 
spent 11 years working beneath the buildings baking cakes and rolls 
for unknowing diners dozens of stories above 
durr says he doesnt mind spending each working day underground 
and hes not alone in his feelings 
they wanted me on the 106th floor i told them i wouldnt go 
said mike linz who oversees the inhilco inc food operation the 
only thing i do different down here is call my wife before i leave 
and find out what the weathers like 
as constant as the climatecontrolled wtc work space are the 
rumors of alligators scrambling through manhattans 6000plus miles 
of sewer pipes persistent tales of reptiles roaming the sewers even 
gave rise to a movie alligator released several years ago 
people are always talking about alligators in the sewer

trial in jerusalem where he is considered a dangerously violent 
member of the brutal abu nidal terror network 
israeli and american authorities believe ahmad was a prime 
participant in a 1986 attack on a bus outside tel aviv that killed 
the driver and injured three jewish settlers 
but ahmads lawyer former us attorney general ramsey clark 
insists his client is an innocent man illegally kidnapped from 
south america by the fbi clark says an israeli shin beth security 
squad tortured two of ahmads cousins until they implicated him in 
the bus attack 
of all the cruel and unusual punishment you could be subjected 
to perhaps the worst is to be convicted of a crime you didnt 
commit says clark 
if the only evidence they have is a confession that is 
inherently unreliable taken by torture of another person that 
cannot be objectively examined theres no justice search for trial 
or truth he argues 
the governments of israel and the united states which initially 
lost the right to extradite ahmad but regained it on appeal only to 
have it challenged again insist they have indisputable evidence 
linking the 36yearold man to the attack 
over 28 months a parade of legal experts and personalities has 
traveled to the federal courthouse in downtown brooklyn to give 
their opinions why ahmad should or shouldnt be forced back to 
israel 
alan dershowitz the harvard law professor and legal writer 
appeared for prosecutors and argued the fairness of israels courts 
but the noted israeli civilrights lawyer and antizionist leah 
tsemel says physical and emotional torture are commonly used in 
israel to force prisoners to say what the authorities want to hear 
us district judge jack b weinstein is considering a writ of 
habeas corpus filed by clark and a decision could come next month a 
habeas writ puts the burden of proof on the federal authorities to 
justify ahmads continued detention 
ms tsemel born in jerusalem several years before the nation of 
israel was founded represents hundreds of palestinians and other 
arabs whose rights are allegedly routinely trampled by israeli 
security forces trying to maintain control of the occupied 
territories seized in 1967 
there is a stage where its mistreatment and then it becomes 
torture she says of interrogation by the israeli security force 
shin beth i dont think all the security services men are 
sadists i think they have a target they want a confession 
should weinstein decide for the government he could well 
sentence ahmad to such treatment while condemning him to prisons 
that are considered among the worst in the world ms tsemel 
told the judge 
shin beth does have a nasty reputation dershowitz concedes but 
he asserts his studies of the israeli legal system have found the 
perception to be largely hype designed to intimidate recalcitrant 
palestinian suspects 
israeli interrogators rely very heavily on the fear that things 
are going to be a lot worse than they are at the interview he 
says both sides have reason for wanting it to be believed that 
interrogated subjects are tortured 
the state attorney for israel dorit beinish insists ahmad 
charged with murder attempted murder attempted arson and other 
crimes will be treated fairly tried in civil court by a 
threejudge panel and will not be held under the harsh conditions 
common in the jails of the occupied territories 
ahmad whom israeli authorities sometime refer to as mahmoud abed 
atta is charged with taking part in an april 12 1986 attack in 
which three men allegedly ahmad and his two cousins hurled 
molotov cocktails and then opened fire with machine guns on a bus 
carrying jewish settlers in the occupied west bank 
ahmad was born in the west bank town of ramala and became a us 
citizen seven years ago his last job was working at his brothers 
filling station in puerto rico according to travel documents he 
was visiting his family near ramala at the time of the attack but 
he denies involvement 
a month later when his visa expired ahmad left israel and 
traveled to europe and then new york in an unsuccessful effort to 
get a visa extension so he could return to ramala where his wife 
and children were living clark said in an interview 
ahmad then went to venezuela for the next several months as 
israeli authorities mounted an international search for him ahmad 
made frequent trips to spain cyprus colombia and mexico to address 
palestinian gatherings 
he was arrested entering caracas on april 27 1987 but because 
venezula has no extradition treaty with israel he was handed over 
illegally clark asserts to the fbi agents hustled him onto a 
flight to new york and us authorities arrested him once he was 
within american jurisdiction since then he has been held without 
bail at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan 
ahmad was likely involved in the attack a federal magistrate and 
a federal judge in brooklyn agree but they are at odds over what 
should be done with him 
in june 1988 magistrate john l caden ruled the attack on the 
bus a political objective and thus outside the jurisdiction of 
the usisrael extradition treaty he also said the way the fbi 
nabbed ahmad and put him in an american jail was unconstitutional 
us district judge edward r korman later reversed caden in a 
sharply worded ruling saying the magistrate applied erroneous 
legal standards and his findings of fact are plainly erroneous 
kormans ruling that ahmad could be returned to israel was 
immediately challenged and is under review by weinstein

a lonely howl pierces the prairie as 
three wolves prance into a sunbaked field ready to dance with an 
unlikely partner 
the wolves circle the bison inching closer seeking a sign of 
weakness or sickness there are none within minutes the silent 
standoff ends predator and prey go their separate ways 
welcome to another day at wolf park a remote patch of corn 
country claiming to be the only place of its kind where the 
interaction of wolves and bison in captivity is studied 
at the 75acre park humans raise wolves bottlefeeding 
cuddling and sleeping beside them in their infancy study their 
behavior witness their rare dominance fights and teach people that 
the animals are neither cuddly creatures nor the epitome of evil 
seen in horror movies 
people tend to have two kinds of prejudice against wolves a 
negative one where its a bad animal that kills for fun said pat 
goodmann a research associate then theres a positive prejudice 
where wolves can do no wrong the truth lies somewhere in the 
middle 
the man who dispels the myths is erich klinghammer a 
bespectacled silverbearded native of germany who founded the park 
in 1972 when allergies forced him to abandon his dove and pigeon 
research 
the wolf is a symbol of the vanishing wilderness said 
klinghammer an associate professor of psychological sciences at 
purdue university if kept in captivity it should be an 
ambassador for its species 
the wolves are just that on friday nights during summer and fall 
when people come to exchange howls with the animals the cries 
rippling across the moonlit fields on sundays folks can witness 
dramatic beastvsbeast faceoffs when a few wolves are taken to the 
bison pasture to test their vulnerability 
often its little more than a staring match the shaggy brown 
bison glare impassively from huge heads framed by manes of thick 
hair 
the wolf is an opportunist said klinghammer its like 
muggers or a pursesnatcher who go after people with a sign of 
weakness if an opportunity arises they think they can take an 
animal they will they attack when the odds are in their favor 
a healthy bison is hard to put down 
klinghammer a zoo consultant and expert on dog and wolf 
behavior defends this experiment it causes no stress he says and 
can help farmers protect cattle from wolves and provide clues to how 
bison deal with their young 
no animals have been seriously injured in nine years the 
wolves have never been hurt beyond what we couldnt kiss and make 
better goodmann said 
whats more at any sign of danger the wolves can be distracted 
or stopped if theres any indication of weakness the bison will be 
removed and tended 
wolves have a keen sense for weakness once a wolf tested a bison 
for about 20 minutes a week later the bison developed pneumonia 
i suspect the wolf could hear breathing problems before we could 
see any clinical signs the animal was sick klinghammer said 
though learning about wolves is part of his mission klinghammer 
also wants to teach people the animals arent good pets 
a tragic example is mickey a wolf brought to the park after it 
killed a boy in the michigan back yard where it was tied up treated 
as a pet when the boy approached mickey knocked the kid over 
because he wanted to greet him klinghammer said he was lonely 
the child struggled and cried thats the sound of wounded prey and 
he killed him 
unlike mickey the other 20 wolves were born at the park theyre 
taken from their mothers in the first weeks bottlefed and nurtured 
by men and women so they adjust to both staffers get an 
insidethepack view sleeping on mattresses next to their charges 
in the early weeks the cubs are reunited periodically with their 
elders they need to see adult wolves klinghammer said 
theyre very fearful they have to remember what big wolves look 
like so they feel safe 
the adults adapt lowering their heads and tails body language 
that wont frighten the cubs its an inhibition about hurting 
babies its instinctive theyre very solicitous of the babies the 
males too theyre good family animals 
each park wolf has a name theres mephisto faust and imbo 
among others and each has a place in the pack where the dominant 
male and female are dubbed the alpha members in this stratified 
world a wolf can go from leader to outcast those are the 
fortunes of war klinghammer said 
life can be cruel for the wolf at the bottom the omega who 
often is harassed or harmed its like the child in the school 
everyone picks on in the wild they would become loners in 
captivity we have them removed 
two are now isolated at the park which is operated by the north 
american wildlife park foundation 
another bitter and potentially fatal fact of the wolfs world is 
the rare dominance fight one sister once killed another at the park 
all social animals will fight for rank in many cases kill for 
it klinghammer said thats certainly true for humans 
despite the tragedies his affection for wolves has grown since 
the day decades ago when he was overcome with emotion at the sight 
of his first two while horseback riding in nebraska 
running a wolf park on a shoestring sometimes you wish you 
could chuck it all he said then you look at the wolves and 
thats what keeps you going its a spiritual thing almost

lou vanwert used to amaze her friends by 
throwing her shoulder out of joint with just the slightest movement 
that was before she knew her tricks were symptoms of a 
littleknown genetic disorder that probably plagued many circus 
contortionists 
my father called me a bag of bones said vanwert 65 of 
williamsville ny but nobody ever thought anything of it 
the hereditary disease is ehlersdanlos syndrome in slang 
terms the human pretzel disease its sufferers have defective 
collagen a protein found in connective tissue 
vanwert who was diagnosed in her late 30s has watched closely 
as five of her eight grandchildren developed mild symptoms she 
chides her granddaughter when she contorts her body because such 
stunts can make the disease worse 
vanwert joined about 80 other patients doctors and researchers 
this month at the second annual conference of the ehlersdanlos 
national foundation one of the organizers was susan stephenson a 
richmond nurse who started the group four years ago with nancy 
rogowski a southgate mich secretary 
the foundation stephenson said is trying to find ehlersdanlos 
sufferers and inform doctors how to look for symptoms of the 
disease people are diagnosed oftentimes at autopsy with our 
disease she said 
stephenson 35 found out she had ehlersdanlos 10 years ago the 
discovery followed years of pain in her feet and knees numerous 
operations and countless appointments with doctors baffled by her 
symptoms all they ever told my parents was that i had very loose 
joints and i bruised very easily 
her joints were so loose that she could turn over in bed and 
dislocate a kneecap a shoulder or a collarbone 
after undergoing surgery three times in five months to relieve 
her pain stephenson started going to medical libraries to try to 
find a disease that fit her symptoms her research led her to johns 
hopkins university in baltimore where an orthopedic surgeon 
correctly diagnosed her 
its a very underdiagnosed disorder said catherine a 
stolle an assistant professor of molecular biology at the robert 
wood johnson medical school in new brunswick nj if you can be 
diagnosed earlier you can make choices lifestyle choices that 
avoid certain twisting motions heavy burdens heavy loads that will 
do more damage to the joints 
stolle said her research is aimed at developing a test to 
diagnose the syndrome in young children a prenatal test is another 
goal 
there is no cure but some sufferers can be helped by surgery or 
large amounts of vitamin c stephenson said 
there are at least 11 variations of ehlersdanlos syndrome some 
mild and others that can be crippling or fatal an estimated 1 in 
5000 to 1 in 20000 people are born with the affliction the 
foundation has 565 members in this country and 32 in nine foreign 
countries stephenson said 
vanwert who wears a leg brace and stephenson who uses a 
wheelchair said it has helped them to meet people who share their 
chronic pain and sleepless nights 
you think youre the only one in the world vanwert said 
especially when the medical profession thinks youre nuts 
they dont understand your pain stephenson said if you 
make it through a few consecutive days without a joint dislocating 
that is a major feat

the search for an oil substitute has 
lost much of its urgency but researchers in florida texas and 
hawaii believe they are getting closer to the day when hydrogen is 
as common as gasoline 
they view hydrogen as the fuel of the future a replacement for 
all fossil fuels not only in cars but in the home in industry and 
elsewhere 
the arguments for development of hydrogen resources are 
irrefutable said david block director of the florida solar 
energy center one of the four facilities trying to come up with 
methods to produce hydrogen inexpensively on a large scale use it 
to generate power and store it 
hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements it can be 
separated from its chemical combinations like water in a number 
of ways it wont pollute the environment and in fact scientists 
working on the project say can help stave off the global warming 
blamed in part on the effect of burning fossil fuels 
perhaps the bestknown use is on space shuttles which burn 
385000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen mixed with liquid 
oxygen to reach orbit 
participating in the federally funded research project with the 
florida solar energy center are scientists at the clean energy 
research institute at the university of miami the center for 
electrochemical systems and hydrogen research at texas aampm 
university and the hawaii natural energy institute 
hydrogen can be produced now the problem is that the cost is 
prohibitive for everyday consumer use said john appleby who 
heads the texas aampm effort to use photovoltaic cell structures to 
make hydrogen to use in cars he too believes using hydrogen is 
important to curtail the greenhouse effect 
we feel that the way to go in the future would be nonpolluting 
vehicles powered by fuel cells using hydrogen to get rid of the 
pollution once and for all said appleby a professor of applied 
electrochemistry the cost would be reasonable to the consumer and 
the cost to society wouldnt exist 
however efforts to come up with an economically affordable 
hydrogen fuel cell or produce hydrogen by a variety of other 
methods will take forever were talking well after the year 
2000 appleby said 
one problem is the governments lukewarm support politically and 
financially for research efforts some scientists say while the 
government says is is spending 30 million a year for hydrogen 
research only 24 million a year goes to the four institutions 
seeking economical ways to produce a fuel 
the rest of the money is for fusion reactors and involves 
hydrogen isotopes said appleby fusion research has absolutely 
nothing to do with fuel in the hands of the ordinary person 
block believes there must be a gradual transition from gasoline 
to hydrogen in automobiles using combinations of various fuels 
before there can be a total conversion to hydrogen fsec plans to 
develop a vehicle fueled by a mixture of methane and hydrogen 
providing fuel economy power and lower emission levels 
fsec scientists are studying a combination thermochemical and 
electrochemical processes to produce the element economically and 
they are trying to identify the most promising of the 
hydrogenproduction technologies 
their work so far shows that separating water into its elements 
of hydrogen and oxygen can best be accomplished using solar energy 
block said 
the hawaiian facility is working on using biomass or vegetation 
and ocean water as possible hydrogen production sources among other 
projects 
researchers at the university of miami are devising ways to use 
hydrogen along with assessing the economics involved 
among the chief concerns of scientists involved in research and 
development of alternative fuels are the uncertainties of future 
supplies and costs of oil but hydrogen supporters are increasingly 
citing the greenhouse effect and acid rain as reasons for a strong 
national effort to develop hydrogen as a fuel 
the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is steadily 
releasing massive amounts of carbon and other heattrapping gases 
into the atmosphere some scientists say this may eventually lead to 
a climatic catastrophe 
if we want a planet worth saving in 50 years block said 
weve got to find a suitable replacement for fossil fuels

increased sightings of dolphin calves in 
the past three months is encouraging but recovery from two years of 
poisoning that killed hundreds of dolphins will be a slow process 
researchers say 
seeing more babies is a good sign but these calves have to 
grow up said marine scientist keith rittmaster calves accounted 
for almost 16 percent of the bottlenose dolphins seen along the 
north carolina coast compared with 73 percent before the 19871988 
dieoff whose cause is still debated 
i think its higher than has been recorded anywhere for the 
bottlenose dolphins i suspect the whole population is trying to 
bounce back he said 
because there is little data it is impossible to say if dolphin 
birth rates have increased elsewhere along the east coast said 
gerald p scott of the national marine fisheries service in miami 
in fact scott predicted that dolphin births would drop over the 
next few years because of the dieoff 
the dolphins found dead in 1987 and 1988 were of all age groups 
but a larger percentage of them were sexually immature 3 to 6 
years old and their deaths could cost much of the next generation 
he said 
about 750 dolphins washed ashore along the east coast during that 
time the national oceanic and atmospheric administration blamed the 
deaths on a toxin from red tide algae some scientists and 
conservationists blame pollution

the federal aviation administration decided to take a new look at 
the way commercial aircraft are inspected after a piece of an aloha

discovered said faa engineer tom defiore 
after comparing the speed and effectiveness of various methods 
the faa will recommend an inspection technique defiore said 
our final goal is that you bring the plane on the gate in the 
evening and we can tell in a couple of hours whether it is 
airworthy said vahaviolos who founded the company in 1978 one 
test can cost 10000 to 100000 
physical acoustics techniques are already in practice for 
corporate and private air carriers said james helms of tramsport 
aircraft technical services co an ojai califbased inspecton 
services company there is nothing wrong per se with current 
technology however its too errorprone when its subject to 
deadline pressure when they have to get it done overnight 
physical acoustics places sensors on the planes skin while it 
goes through a series of pressurization cycles cracks or corrosion 
emit sounds that can be analyzed by a computer wing joints are 
tested by simply loading fuel 
it has detected flaws from 10 inches to 05 inches said

a restructuring plan announced by eastman 
kodak co to bring in up to 1 billion in extra cash next year 
probably wont involve the sale of major divisions analysts say 
kodak officials said wednesday that disappointing secondquarter 
earnings prompted the reorganization under which it will eliminate 
4500 jobs worldwide this year or about 3 percent of its work 
force and sell or consolidate certain operations 
the company which employs 145000 people worldwide including 
47000 at its rochester headquarters previously announced plans to 
cut 1000 jobs this year that figure is included in the new 
cutbacks 
robert welk a rochesterbased economics consultant said paring 
the payroll is wise because kodak has too many employees compared 
with its competitors 
theyre addressing what has to be done he said it 
definitely is going to be a different company 
its not a massive restructuring said alex henderson an 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc its a major 
belttightening very much needed by kodak 
company spokesman paul allen could not provide specifics on where 
the jobs would be eliminated 
the reductions will be targeted at divisions with combined sales 
of 125 billion or about 7 percent of kodaks overall 17 billion 
in sales last year officials said kodak said it would sell close 
or reorganize those businesses to reduce operating costs 
the units most likely to be affected are smaller ones the company 
started or bought in the 1980s analysts said 
some have speculated its information systems operation which 
includes copiers and microfilm and graphics equipment would be 
targeted that segment lost 144 million in the second quarter 
david nelson an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc said 
kodak apparently is avoiding a fire sale of assets but he 
added you dont reassure your employees by leaving them to wonder 
whether theyre part of the 125 billion in businesses which are up 
for grabs 
kodak laid off about 13000 workers in 1986 and 10800 in 1983 
in both instances profits rose substantially the next year 
we have dealt with adversity in the past but never with such 
broadbased intensity said kodaks chairman and chief executive 
officer colby chandler these uncharacteristic actions are being 
carried out with great resolve by the entire management team 
chandler said the restructuring should improve operating results 
by up to 1 billion next year 
at company headquarters kodak said it would freeze workers pay 
in 1990 except in special cases and change the pay structure of 
managers so it will be linked more closely to financial results 
up to 40 percent of pay for top managers chandler president 
kay whitmore and vice chairman j phillip samper will be tied to 
the companys financial performance

total control of the operations of wang laboratories wang said 
he will have my full support and that of the board of directors in 
resolving the companys current situation and restoring it to

drexel burnham lambert inc is reminding its 
employees not to do business with its indicted former junk bond 
chief michael milken 
separately sources said wednesday that federal prosecutors are 
reconsidering their agreement with drexel that bars the investment 
house from paying milken his 1988 compensation of more than 100 
million 
drexel this week issued a threesentence memo to all workers 
saying they cannot advise corporate clients if they also are being 
advised by milken who has resigned from drexel and set up a 
financial consulting firm 
while employees of drexel burnham may have purely social 
contact with them business matters that do or could involve drexel 
burnham are not to be discussed read the memo signed by drexel 
chief executive frederick joseph 
under a separate settlement with the securities and exchange 
commission drexel and its employees are barred from doing business 
with milken and his brother lowell who also is charged by the 
government 
the milkens were not party to the firms sec settlement which is 
to take effect after drexel enters its criminal plea 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the memo was issued because 
the firm is determined to live within the spirit of the sec 
agreement in the absence of its finalization 
drexel was barred from paying milken as part of its formal 
settlement of criminal securities fraud charges 
the withholding of pay has been controversial because milken has 
not been charged with committing any wrongdoing during 1988 milken 
has challenged the provision in us district court in manhattan 
sources familiar with the case who asked not to be identified 
said prosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to let 
drexel pay milken his compensation which court documents place at 
well over 100 million 
but they indicated a reversal may be made because legal experts 
have criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional and 
the government may not want to start its case against milken before 
us district judge kimba wood on the wrong foot 
they said ending the lengthy delay of drexels plea in the case 
was not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision but the 
move could help to speed resolution of the drawnout case 
spokesmen for drexel and milken declined to comment 
assistant us attorney john carroll said when and if we make 
a decision with regard to any matters in these cases we will tell 
them to judge wood before we tell them to anyone else 
milken was charged in march in a 98count indictment with 
racketeering and fraud related to securities transactions he 
pleaded innocent and is scheduled to go to trial in march 
a us district court hearing is scheduled for sept 6 on 
milkens arguments that the pay provision deprived him of 
constitutional due process 
the government has indicated milkens compensation was ordered 
withheld on grounds it was improper for drexel to settle criminal 
charges while it was paying millions to the employee allegedly 
responsible for illegal activity 
drexel agreed in december to pay 650 million and plead guilty to 
six felonies for violating securities laws charges that stemmed 
from the ivan boesky insider trading case the plea has been held up 
by a series of legal issues related to milken the last of which was 
his challenge of the pay requirement

malcolm forbes says his children ultimately will 
pay for his lavish birthday party last weekend in morocco and that 
he wont try to write it off his income taxes as a business expense 
my children gave me the party im picking up the tab but in a 
few years theyll be picking up the business and so what i have 
spent on this birthday party in effect is coming out of their 
inheritance forbes told reporters wednesday 
the business magazine publisher had come under criticism over 
published reports quoting he and his son malcolm forbes jr as 
saying they considered some of the 2 million in party costs to be 
business expenses that led to speculation that forbes was planning 
to use part of the birthday tab as a tax deduction 
forbes called a news conference wednesday to try to deflect the 
criticism he said that while a case could be made for using the 
party costs as a business deduction not a penny would be 
written off 
it was never planned to be a taxdeductible trip forbes 
said where people got the notion i presume they got it 
because threequarters of the people there are major advertisers in 
forbes magazine 
business expenses generally are at least partly tax deductible 
forbes 70th birthday party in tangier on the north coast of 
africa featured 600 belly dancers 200 berber horsemen pigeon pie 
served under elaborate tents and a guest list that included 
elizabeth taylor henry kissinger barbara walters and such business 
luminaries as lee iacocca rupert murdoch and henry kravis 
guests were flown across the atlantic on three jets including a 
chartered supersonic concorde the partys expense had been 
estimated at 2 million to 3 million although forbes said 
wednesday the tab might not exceed 2 million because the government 
of morocco paid for part of the event including guards 
forbes said the party had real business value to forbes and its 
customers and that as a result forbes magazine would be launching 
an edition in germany and may branch out into italy spain and japan 
he likened it to the parties for advertisers that most magazines 
give and write off 
rep fortney stark dcalif on tuesday released a letter he 
sent to internal revenue service commissioner fred t goldberg 
saying he hoped the party was not deductible 
the publics support of the tax system is destroyed by reports 
of taxdeductible birthday bashes by bellydancing billionaires 
stark wrote 
forbes called starks comments a form of electionyear 
demagoguery 
the irs has declined to comment on the party 
forbes conceded that an attempted writeoff might not go over well 
with tax auditors 
as i discussed with my boys the idea of flying everybody in 
super aircraft to a far outpost to celebrate a birthday would be 
stretching things in my opinion he said

time warner inc and warner communications inc 
announced that warner shareholders would receive a package of 
securities for their stock when the two media giants complete their 
14 billion merger 
the companies said wednesday that each of warners 868 million 
shares still outstanding would be exchanged for securities valued at 
70 comprising two series of time warner preferred stock and common 
stock of bhc inc a subsidiary of chriscraft industries inc 
time inc acquired approximately 100 million other warner shares 
at 70 a share in a cash tender offer that expired july 24 at that 
point the company changed its name to time warner inc 
the package announced wednesday known as the back end of the 
merger means time warners debt will not be further ballooned by 
the cost of acquiring warner shareholders and analysts had been 
concerned about the amount of debt time warner would have following 
the merger 
edward adler a time warner spokesman said time warner would 
incur 12 billion in debt in the acquisition and with nearly 16 
billion in already outstanding debt would have a total of 136 
billion in liabilities 
fred anschel an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said the 
fact that no cash was involved in the back end was a plus for time 
warner 
time warner stock gained 212 to close at 14175 a share in 
new york stock exchange composite trading 
however there appeared to be some confusion among warner 
investors about the breakdown of the preferred stock and warner 
stock slipped 162 to 6537 a share 
the preferred stock can be converted to common stock in time 
warner in the future but the two series carry different terms for 
their conversion and different dividends 
stock in bhc was included in the back end as a result of a 
settlement between warner and chriscraft the settlement was part 
of warners attempt to sever its ties with chriscraft warners 
largest shareholder 
analysts were still studying the details of the back end late 
wednesday ken noble an analyst with painewebber inc said that at 
first glance the terms appeared good for current warner shareholders 
time warner said it expected paperwork and approvals for the back 
end to be completed in the fourth quarter at that time the merger 
will be completed and warner communications will cease to exist 
time warner will be the worlds largest communications concern 
time inc and warner communications announced plans to merge in a 
stockswap in march on june 6 2 weeks before shareholders were to 
vote on the deal paramount communications inc announced a hostile 
tender offer for time 
to preserve their merger time and warner amended their agreement 
to provide for times 14 billion tender offer for warner 
paramounts 12 billion bid collapsed after the delaware supreme 
court upheld a lower court ruling that paramount had no right to 
interfere with times longrange plans 
the ruling allowed the timewarner deal to go through and it also 
was seen as upholding the rights of companies to arrange friendly 
mergers without fear of having their plans upset by hostile suitors

sir james goldsmith says he would sell farmers 
group inc a us insurance company to a french firm for 45 
billion if he succeeds in his 21 billion bid for farmers parent 
company bat industries plc 
the french company axa midi assurances also agreed to invest 
942 million in hoylake investments ltd goldsmiths takeover 
vehicle the british investor said wednesday 
after goldsmith announced his groups hostile 134 billion pound 
offer last month he said he would sell all of bats nontobacco 
interests including farmers if he was successful 
the agreement with axa midi clearly reaffirms our stated 
intention that we do not wish to operate farmers goldsmith said 
in a statement 
bat a british conglomerate that has rejected the hoylake bid 
responded to wednesdays announcement by telling shareholders they 
would be deprived of farmers current value and future potential if 
hoylake were allowed to sell the insurance company on the cheap in 
a forced sale 
farmers is the thirdlargest home and auto insurer and the 
seventhbiggest property and casualty insurer in the united states 
it operates mostly in the western part of the country 
any acquisition of farmers whether by hoylake or axa midi must 
be approved by insurance regulators in the states where farmers does 
business bat acquired farmers for 52 billion last year after an 
eightmonth takeover fight that included battles before the 
insurance regulators of several states 
there was heavy opposition to the takeover by bat in part because 
the conglomerate had no other insurance holdings however axa midi 
which comprises mutual and shareholderowned insurance companies 
has us holdings including equity and law and has a full insurance 
license in 27 states including seven where farmers operates 
axa midi one of the largest insurance groups in france and 
europe had premium income of 42 billion french francs or 636 
billion in 1988 
on monday bat unveiled its defensive strategy against the 
goldsmith group which also includes british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer 
the conglomerate pointing to its past earnings record told 
shareholders they would profit more by holding on to their bat stock 
than by tendering it to hoylake 
bat emphasized the strengths of its businesses which besides 
farmers includes brown amp williamson tobacco retailers saks fifth 
avenue and marshall fields and paper maker appleton papers in 
wisconsin 
securities analysts said they expected bat to deploy more active 
defenses if and when goldsmith raises his bid 
a takeover of bat would be the worlds secondlargest after the 
2453 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co earlier this year 
goldsmith said axa midis prospective investment would increase 
the total cash committed to hoylake to 236 billion 
axa midi was to pay half of the 45 billion for farmers in cash 
at the close of the deal and the rest in notes with maturities of 
two to three years hoylake said

a move by five grocery chains against a 
synthetic hormone designed to boost cows milk production may help 
delay government approval for its commercial use says an 
antigenetic engineering activist 
five food chains say they are not selling milk from cows treated 
experimentally with the synthetic hormone jeremy rifkin head of 
the foundation on economic trends said wednesday 
bovine growth hormone or bgh is designed to boost cows 
production by as much as onethird 
the decision by the food companies as well as rising concerns in 
dairy states will put a lot of pressure on the food and drug 
administration to put off final approval of the hormone for general 
use rifkin said 
the fda has allowed private companies to run limited onfarm 
tests of bgh and this milk has been reaching consumers rifkin said 
i dont think its a large amount he said in a telephone 
interview but if it is being sold over and over again in a small 
test area to the same consumers it could have an impact 
however fda spokesman bill grigg said the milk from test cows 
was indistinguishable from ordinary milk and can be safely sold 
because it has the same amount of bgh in it as ordinary milk grigg 
said the agency expects to publish data in january supporting that 
conclusion 
grigg said he could not say if or when bgh will be cleared for 
general farm use because studies aimed at proving it is effective 
and safe for both humans and cows have not been completed 
rifkin said exact locations of the tests milk processors the 
number of cows and amounts of milk involved have not been disclosed 
a number of companies are working on their own versions of bgh 
those include monsanto upjohn american cyanamid and eli lilly 
rifkin said his foundation was joined by more than 40 other 
public officials and national farm consumer animal welfare and 
environmental groups in a petition asking the fda to immediately 
halt sales of milk and dairy products from cows treated with the 
hormone 
the groups also asked the agency to support longterm independent 
research on the hormones effects on humans and what kind of 
economic impact can be expected among dairy armers many of whom say 
they will be forced out of business by lower milk prices if bgh is 
approved 
rifkin said the food companies that agreed to ban bgh milk 
included the giant kroger chain which is headquartered in 
cincinnati ohio and safeway which has its corporate offices in 
oakland calif 
others include supermarkets general woodbridge nj stop and 
shop boston mass and vons el monte calif 
paul bernish spokesman for kroger which operates in 32 states 
said the company has refused for the past year to buy dairy products 
from test herds receiving bgh 
we feel it is entirely appropriate for the government to be 
testing this hormone he said but until the government finishes 
its testing and gives an ok to use this hormone we have told our 
suppliers that we would not accept dairy products from those test 
herds 
safeway spokesman brian dowling said the company about three 
years ago required milk suppliers to certify that their cows had not 
been given the hormone 
a spokeswoman for the vons chain says their supermarkets have 
never sold bgh milk because their supplier the california milk 
producers association doesnt offer the product 
meanwhile ice cream maker ben and jerrys homemade inc of 
waterbury vt said it will label 6 million of its pints with a 
message to stop bgh save family farms but monsanto spokesman 
lawrence oneill said the companys campaign is unfair its 
unfortunate its misinformed and discouraging 
the hormone is also known by its technical name bovine 
somatotropin or bst it is a protein produced naturally in the 
pituitary gland of cattle among its metabolic functions is the 
regulation of a cows milk output requiring the animal to eat more 
as milk production is stepped up 
the bgh controversy has raged in major dairy states like 
wisconsin california new york and vermont the vermont state 
legislature earlier this year called for a moratorium on commercial 
use of bgh until further studies are made 
at a wisconsin legislative hearing in may one witness described 
bgh as the ak47 of wisconsin agriculture because of its 
potential threat to the states dairy industry referring to the 
automatic weapon favored by many terrorists 
but james w lauderdale of the upjohn co one of the developers 
told the hearing that if the hormone is approved by fda it should be 
given the same chance to perform as every other tool used by dairy 
farmers

a bank for children thinks a credit card is 
just what its kiddie customers want but one opponent says teaching 
a new generation how to borrow is the last thing this debtplagued 
country needs 
we think it teaches absolutely the wrong message said loren 
dunton president of the national center for financial education a 
nonprofit group that seeks to promote financial responsibility 
our message is to save now so you can buy later and theyre 
promoting the philosophy of buy now and pay later 
the san diegobased center plans to use its branches in 50 states 
to ask parents and teachers to oppose a plan by the young americans 
bank to provide credit cards to children ages 12 and older 
it offers the temptation to spend that even much older people 
too often cant resist dunton said in an interview in san 
francisco wednesday 
but the denverbased bank whose customers are all young people 
said it is trying to teach the proper use of credit as part of 
personal finance 
our feeling is that credit cards are really a way of life and 
a lot of us learn about credit in an undesireable way without 
any supervision or control bank president linda sanders said 
here that is done with control 
the bank which already offers checking accounts to customers 12 
and older expects to issue the first cards by the end of this week 
it has received hundreds of applications from all over the country 
since announcing earlier this month it would offer mastercards to 
young people through the united bank of denver 
applicants must have a parent or other adult cosign to guarantee 
payment and they wont be able to exceed a credit limit of 100 
otherwise the cards will be like those issued to adults with 
monthly statements and interest accruing at an annual rate of 188 
percent 
dunton said the low credit limit cosigning requirement and even 
instruction on responsible use are not sufficient safeguards 
you cant expect a teenager to use it responsibly when 
yuppies who have been educated to the teeth cant do it he said 
the center argues that excessive borrowing and consumption have 
become deeprooted and are hurting the nations economy americans 
saved only 32 percent of their income in 1987 for example while 
japanese saved an average of 165 percent 
the center advocates greater savings a balanced budget amendment 
to the constitution and a requirement that rehabilitative education 
be made part of bankruptcy procedures dunton says there is no shame 
or embarrassment attached to bankruptcy filings these days and he 
considers that a bad sign 
rather than giving youngsters credit cards dunton advocates 
teaching all elementary school students about money and high school 
seniors about personal finance including credit 
what they need is a savings account before a credit card they 
should put off getting a credit card until they absolutely need it 
for identification he said 
sanders said she was sympathetic to duntons concerns teaching 
children about financial responsibility was one of the reasons the 
bank was founded two years ago she said 
young americans statechartered and federally insured has 59 
million in deposits from more than 9300 customers they range in 
age from newborns to 22 with the bulk 8 to 14 sanders said 
the bank has about 1100 checking accounts held by customers with 
an average age of 15 it also has about 1500 borrowers with a total 
of 950000 outstanding about a third of which is for student loans 
customers come from across the nation although the majority live 
in colorado 
the bank decided to offer credit cards at the request of 
customers polled by its advisory board of young people sanders said 
the bank has not had any problems with overdrawn accounts or loan 
defaults sanders said she expressed confidence that young 
customers will use the cards responsibly 
i have been in banking for 20 years and have never dealt with a 
customer base with more integrity she said

car sales by the eight major usbased automakers 
rose 54 percent in midaugust while light truck sales fell 21 
percent indicating that some buyers may be rushing to showrooms to 
beat 1990 price increases 
overall car and truck sales continued running behind last years 
pace by 33 percent the companies said in sales reports wednesday 
the two big leading economic indicators that being 
unemployment and interest rates dont seem to have softened said 
analyst paul kleinaitis of duff amp phelps of chicago 
so given that and given the fact that price increases are due 
for the big three maybe buyers were accelerated into purchasing now 
rather than in the new model year he said 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp have 
announced average car price increases of 34 percent 48 percent 
and 5 percent respectively 
i think the uptick we had in july sales was partly an 
increase in consumer awareness of a price increase said analyst 
mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc in new york city 
but the incentives got richer and the combinations make some 
deals too good to resist for some people she said right now 
were borrowing sales from the fourth quarter 
on wednesday the automakers reported combined car and truck 
sales averaging 34290 a day during the aug 1120 period this year 
up 26 percent from a rate of 33409 during the same time last year 
the numbers look good to me compared to what weve been 
conditioned to expect kleinaitis said 
through last sunday companies said 1989 vehicle sales averaged 
37908 a day down 33 percent from the 39222 vehicleaday rate 
during the same period last year 
gm said its midaugust car sales were off 07 percent compared 
with last year and for the year to date its car sales were down 83 
percent gms truck sales were up 43 percent in midaugust and up 
19 percent for the year to date 
ford said its car sales were up 28 percent during the second 
10day period of august but were down 14 percent for the year 
fords light truck sales were down 107 percent in midaugust and 
down 3 percent for the year to date 
chrysler said its car sales during the period were up 6 percent 
from last year and down 133 percent for the year the companys 
light truck sales fell 12 percent for the period and 02 percent 
for the year

a distinct identity for chevrolets geo line of 
small vehicles still hasnt been developed nearly a year after the 
first of the cars were introduced a company executive says 
chevrolet general manager jim perkins said wednesday the gm 
division is about halfway through its process of developing its geo 
franchise 
the company is walking a narrow path between selling and 
servicing the three geo cars and one truck at chevrolet dealers and 
fostering a separate image for the nameplate 
geo cars were introduced in january since then one model the 
spectrum has been dropped and two the metro and storm have been 
added 
separate geo signs are going up at dealerships and some chevrolet 
dealers are taking out space in commercial telephone books in the 
gs to encourage the brand distinction 
also chevrolets wellknown heartbeat of america advertising 
theme going into its fourth year will not be used in geo ads 
instead those ads feature the theme getting to know geo to 
the tune of getting to know you from the play the king and 
i 
the geo imagery is going to become more focused than it has 
been in the past perkins said 
perkins speaking during the introduction of the chevrolet lineup 
for 1990 also said gm is ready to give chevrolet dealers a hand in 
marketing the geo and will boost the potential dealer profit margin 
on geo cars and trucks 
gm has been criticized for failing to give consumers a clear 
picture of its new line of cars for the coming model year there 
will be three geo cars the storm prizm and metro and one 
sportutility vehicle the tracker 
the metro is made by suzuki motor co ltd in japan the tracker 
is made in canada by the gmsuzuki joint venture canadianamerican 
manufacturing inc the prizm is made in fremont calif at the 
gmtoyota joint venture new united motor manufacturing inc and the 
storm is made in fujisawa japan by isuzu motors ltd 
eightyfour percent of the 4800 chevrolet dealers have agreed to 
sell geos gm denied reports earlier this year that some dealers 
were pressured into taking on geo in return for getting a crack at 
selling the new corvette zr1 production of which begins later this 
month in bowling green ky 
perkins said the zr1 with a 370horsepower engine that can push 
the car from 0 to 60 mph in 42 seconds will sell for 58995 
about 3000 of the cars will be available in the united states 
during the 1990 model year mainly because of restraints by the 
engine maker mercury marine 
an undetermined number of zr1 corvettes will be sold in europe 
perkins said 
separately wednesday ford motor co rolled the first 1990 
lincoln town car off the assembly line in wixom mich with a 
ceremony complete with a cake the shape of a 1989 town car the new 
version which will be introduced formally oct 5 is a longer 
slightly rounded version of the 1989 model

subsidiary to operate the companys gaming operations and three 
newer hotel brands

development that will make them increasingly competitive with 
holiday inns

bass plcs proposed 223 billion acquisition of 
the holiday inn hotel system from holiday corp would make britains 
biggest brewer the operator of the worlds largest hotel chain 
the deal which would give bass control of some 1600 holiday 
inns marks an attempt by the londonbased company to diversify away 
from brewing and to expand geographically analysts said thursday 
bass has been criticized in recent years for having its profits 
too heavily concentrated in beer and pubs in britain analysts say 
the companys bass carling black label and tennents beers and the 
7000 pubs it owns in britain represent about 68 percent of its 
operating profits 
rupert symington an analyst with nomura securities in london 
noted that bass is almost completely a brewery and pub company it 
has recognized a need to diversify out of its core business of beer 
and pubs 
with the holiday inn purchase symington said hotels will 
represent 25 percent of basss operating profits compared with 10 
percent currently 
while the acquisition initially might depress bass stock price 
analysts called it a good strategic move for longterm development 
its very difficult when youre no 1 of the british market 
with 22 percent of the market to grow and get a bigger market 
share said one analyst who asked not to be identified 
under terms of the deal bass will acquire 55 owned or leased 
properties as well as franchise agreements joint venture 
agreements and management contracts that cover about 1400 holiday 
inn hotels in north america 
last year bass bought the rights to franchise holiday inn hotels 
outside north america covering about 200 of them 
bass said the acquisition gives it considerable opportunity for 
profit growth by allowing it to capitalize on its vast expertise 
in ownership and management of international hotels 
so far the companys diversification into hotels has been 
successful symington noted that basss 66 crest hotels in britain 
and its european holiday inns are performing well 
last march bass bought the commonwealth hospitality ltd hotel 
chain in canada from scotts hospitality inc of toronto for 222 
million giving it an additional 38 hotels 
bass chairman ian prosser said the acquisition represents a 
substantial move forward in the bass strategy of becoming 
international in each of its core businesses 
but one analyst noted that bass is a very ukbased company 
even after this acquisition threefourths of its profit comes from 
the uk 
over the years bass also has marketed soft drinks under britvic 
and other brand names and operated bingo and snooker halls betting 
shops and a travel agency with mixed results symington said 
on the london stock exchange bass rose 8 cents to close at 
1797 a share 
bass which employs 85000 people reported profits of 504 
million or 137 a share on revenue of 58 billion in the year 
ended september 1988

implementation of ah robins cos 
reorganization plan will be delayed until at least november while 
claimants who challenged the plan appeal its approval to the us 
supreme court claimants said thursday 
were going to the supreme court said rosemary 
menardsanford one of thousands of women who claimed they were 
injured by the dalkon shield birthcontrol device marketed by the 
company in the early 1970s 
more than 94 percent of the claimants voted in favor of the 
reorganization plan confirmed by us district judge robert r 
merhige jr but about 900 women had rejected the plan which was 
upheld in june by the 4th us circuit court of appeals along with a 
related classaction suit against aetna casualty and surety co 
had no further appeals been sought the trust would have been 
funded and the plan consummated sept 28 robins spokesman roscoe 
puckett said thursday 
robins recognizes that it is the appellants right to seek 
further review of the plan by the supreme court puckett said 
however the company believes that the overwhelming majority of 
dalkon shield claimants who voted to accept the plan will share its 
deep disappointment and frustration that there will be further 
indeterminant delays in implementation of the plan 
the appellants decision which will continue to cost claimants 
roughly half a million dollars daily in lost interest income is 
particularly disappointing in light of the fact that five judges 
already have considered the reorganization plan and judged it 
proper 
robins a large pharmaceutical company based in richmond sought 
protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in august 
1985 
included in the reorganization plan are a 23 billion fund to 
compensate claimants injured by the dalkon shield 350 million in 
insurance from aetna the products liability insurer for the device 
and the absorption of robins by american home products corp of new 
york in an exchange of stock worth 700 million to robins 
shareholders 
suits against robins officers and directors and the richmond law 
firm that supervised most of the dalkon shield litigation before the 
bankruptcy action are barred 
in the petition to be filed sept 14 three women represented by 
washington lawyer alan b morrison said they have decided not to 
pursue their contention that the approval of the plan was flawed 
instead the women said they will focus on provisions of the 
plan that bar suits against other defendants which would allow 
robins and american home products to complete their merger if they 
wish 
we believe that the amount of money set aside in the dalkon 
shield claimants trust established by the robins reorganization 
plan is inadequate as it will not provide full compensation for 
dalkon shield victims particularly those with clearly meritorious 
claims and serious injuries said denver lawyer douglas e bragg 
who represents about 100 claimants 
the amount needed to resolve the claims is closer to 42 billion 
to 7 billion bragg said 
he said that since the trust might not have enough money to 
resolve all claims claimants must be free to pursue aetna robins 
officers and directors and the companys attorneys who he said are 
liable because they conspired with robins to cover up the dangers of 
the dalkon shield 
the companies last month rejected a merger that would have 
allowed suits against other defendants the companies have said 
suits against the other potential defendants would result in claims 
for indemnity against the trust defending those claims would 
distract the trustees and reduce the amount of money available to 
pay claims the companies contend 
about 118000 claims still are pending and would be resolved 
through procedures to be developed by trustees of the claimants 
trust 
e claiborne robins patriarch of the pharmaceutical company and 
his son robins president e claiborne robins jr have agreed to 
pay 5 million each to the trust fund which also will get 75 
million from aetna

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
in quiet trading thursday on the chicago board of trade 
overnight rains in the midwest and the national weather services 
6 to 10day forecast which calls for additional precipitation in 
major crop states weighed on the market 
also putting a brake on corn prices were reports that a survey of 
the iowa corn crop placed the peracre yield at higher levels than 
predicted by the us department of agriculture said jerry gidel 
an analyst with lit america inc in chicago 
there had been reports that a lack of rain earlier this month 
caused a decline in the quality of crops in parts of the midwest 
including iowa 
soybean prices were pressured by the weather forecasts and lack 
of demand 
wheat prices were mixed at the start of trading with support 
coming from anticipated orders from egypt and other nations the 
failure of the orders to materialize during trading did not prevent 
wheat prices from finishing higher

the dow jones industrial average surged 5653 
points a new closing high thursday shattering the record set almost 
exactly two years earlier and symbolically marking a recovery from 
the black monday crash 
the index of 30 blue chip industrial stocks which to many 
people symbolizes the stock market finished at 273464 topping 
the previous record close of 272242 of aug 25 1987 
with thursdays session the dow became the last of the widely 
recognized market indicators to recover all the ground it lost in 
the crash of 1987 that culminated with a record 508 point loss on 
oct 19 
wall street has been rallying in recent months largely due to a 
decline in interest rates which investors see as an encouraging 
sign that the federal reserve is controlling inflation without 
causing an economic recession 
widespread speculation in takeover stocks also has helped boost 
prices 
the dow industrials actually had flirted with a new high in 
several sessions earlier this month before pulling back each time at 
the close 
it was sort of a bugaboo for a lot of people said robert 
seijas a market maker at the new york stock exchange just 
getting through it removes a lot of the fear 
on thursday interest rates declined slightly in erratic trading 
while several other takeover developments emerged including holiday 
corps agreement to sell its holiday inn hotel chain to bass plc 
for 223 billion 
bigname stocks also got a boost at midday from a wave of buying 
by professional traders engaged in computerized strategies involving

most international airlines meanwhile agreed to provide seats 
for domestic passengers for the australian segments of international 
flights 
at least eight international carriers including continental

passengers on the domestic segments of their routes the others are 
thai international singapore airlines olympic airways of greece 
garuda of indonesia malaysian airways cathay pacific of hong kong 
and british airways 
the australian government also was considering providing 
emergency services with the help of the air force an air force 
boeing 747 was expected to take to the air on friday 
pilots for qantas airways australias international flag 
carrier refused to act as strikebreakers and said they would not 
cooperate except to pick up domestic passengers for compassionate 
reasons 
the two domestic airlines australian airlines and ansett began 
issuing writs against individual pilots seeking unspecified damages 
to cover lost profits 
the pilots are seeking a wage hike that would boost an average 
annual salary to 100000 us dollars

holiday corp announced the end of its 
reign as americas innkeeper thursday with an agreement to sell 
the holiday inn chain to britains brewing giant bass plc for 223 
billion 
holiday corp said it would form a new subsidiary to run its 
profitable casino business and newer hotel brands embassy suites 
hampton inn and homewood suites 
the announcement was welcomed by investors in the company well 
known for the hundreds of holiday inns that dot the nations 
highways and cities there had been rampant speculation that holiday 
corp would be vulnerable to an unwanted takeover without some sort 
of major restructuring 
holiday corp stock surged 6 a share to 83 in heavy new york 
stock exchange trading on the news 
it clearly focuses holiday corp in the highgrowth segments 
of the hotel business and makes it a more clearly focused company 
said marvin roffman a market analyst with janney montogmery scott 
inc of philadelphia 
the announcement also marked the end of holiday corps leading 
position as owner of the dominant hotel chain in the country a 
status that led the company to describe itself as americas 
innkeeper 
michael d rose holiday corps chief executive officer said 
the companys newer hotel brands have grown to the point they 
compete with holiday inn in the marketplace and for attention within 
the corporation 
it became increasingly clear to us that a separation of holiday 
inns from holiday corps other brands was the most effective 
positioning of the brands in the 1990s and beyond rose said in a 
statement 
the sale which requires shareholder approval calls for holiday 
corps stockholders to draw onequarter share of bass stock for 
each holiday corp share with a value calculated at 125 million 
bass also will assume about 21 billion in outstanding holiday 
debt making the deal worth 23 billion 
in addition the spunoff company will pay a special 35ashare 
cash dividend to holiday corp shareholders worth nearly 935 
million holiday corp has 267 million shares outstanding 
the sale to bass will allow holiday corp to retire 21 billion 
in outstanding debt much of which stems from the companys 
financial recapitalization in 1987 holiday spokesman ralph berry 
said 
as a result of that the new company when its spun off will be 
virtually debt free it will then borrow or finance new borrowing to 
pay the dividend he said 
in addition to approval from shareholders of both companies the 
agreement must also be sanctioned by nevada and new jersey gaming 
officials 
with the sale bass will acquire 55 owned or leased properties as 
well as franchise agreements joint venture agreements and 
management contracts covering 1400 holiday inn hotels in north 
america 
last year bass bought the rights to franchise holiday inn hotels 
outside north america as the result of that and other purchases it 
already owns 14 holiday inn hotels in the southeast united states 
and is a major franchisee in canada 
bass has more than 7300 pubs and other food and drink outlets in 
the united kingdom the company also brews bass carling black label 
and other beers and has annual sales approaching 6 billion 
holiday has sold off numerous assets in recent years as the 
company directed its energies toward property management rather than 
ownership the company sold 127 hotels between 1985 and last year 
berry said 
that was merely selling property but retaining management of 
those properties where this is actually a transaction that will 
remove us from the holiday inns business he said 
bass is expected to keep holiday inns north american 
headquarters in memphis berry said and holiday corp employees now 
working for holiday inn will become bass employees 
roffman said holiday corp is wise to concentrate on its newer 
hotel brands and casinohotel company harrahs 
harrahs is one of the leaders in the gaming industry with 
highly profitable properties roffman said the company is 
poised for substantial growth in their new form and with a much 
better balance sheet

esther eskenasy an analyst for cargill investors services in new 
york described the selloff of coffee futures the first in five 
sessions as panic selling 
the market dropped like a stone from the opening and didnt 
get support until it reached 80 cents she said 
ms eskenasy attributed the decline to an announcement late 
wednesday by brazilian coffee institute president jorio dauster that 
the institute has no plans to begin storing three 60kilogram bags 
of coffee for every bag exported 
dauster said the policy was dropped when the international coffee 
organization abolished export quotas in july

to again address export quotas ms exkenasy said some countries are 
pressing for quotas because of hurting economies 
copper futures continued their upward spiral as production

the highland valley mines in british columbia canada mexicos 
cananea mine is expected to be closed as long as three months 
following a declaration of bankruptcy and the bougainville mine in 
papua new guinea remains closed because of terrorist activities by 
landowners 
demand in the united states and japan remains strong at a time 
of declining stocks at a time of year when they usually increase 
because of slack demand demler said 
copper prices were 260 cents to 290 cents higher with august at 
1305 a pound 
an expected rise in european sugar production sent sugar futures 
plummeting on the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange 
a report prepared by a west german statistician indicates that 
european sugar production will increase by more than 1 million 
metric tons from 309 million metric tons in 19881989

imports

history repeated itself and then some thursday on 
wall street where the dow jones industrial average had a record 
close just one day short of the second anniversary of its previous 
alltime high 
the record appeared to mark wall streets complete recovery from 
the nightmare of black monday oct 19 1987 when the average 
fell a record 508 points in a single session 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks set its record in 
suitably dramatic fashion rocketing 5653 points higher in the 
second biggest gain of the year 
wall streets bestknown average closed at 273464 topping the 
record of 272242 set on aug 25 1987 
as often happens the market made one of its biggest moves on a 
day when nothing in particular happened in the financial world 
outside the floor of the new york stock exchange 
the stock market just came out of nowhere its a real 
surprise said robert brusca chief economist of nikko securities 
co international inc the new york arm of a japanese brokerage 
firm 
separating the new record from the last one was the biggest 
oneday crash in wall street history 
measured from its bottom at the close of black monday to its new 
top stock prices have gone up more than 50 percent 
while nobodys paid much attention to it its two of the 
strongest years back to back that weve had said lawrence r 
helfand managing director for retail sales at rodman amp renshaw inc 
in chicago 
analysts generally believe the stock market is healthier now than 
it was two years ago when speculation inflated a bubble that burst 
in the autumn of 87 stock prices are lower in comparison to 
company profits than they were at their last peak

a federal judge has ruled that texaco 
inc polluted the delaware river over the course of four years by 
discharging about 10000 gallons a day of cooling water that 
contained excess amounts of iron 
the summary judgment issued monday by us district judge jane 
roth is a victory for the natural resources defense council which 
filed suit after both the us environmental protection agency and 
the delaware department of natural resources and environmental 
control found nrdcs complaint too minor to warrant fines or 
penalties a delaware environmental official said 
nrdc alleged that texaco polluted the river from 1984 to 1988 by 
dumping into the delaware cooling water from a refinery containing 
iron levels that exceeded regulatory limits 
between 400 million to 500 million gallons of water were 
discharged daily with about 10000 gallons of that containing 
excessive amounts of iron said gerard l esposito director of the 
state division of water resources 
since the suit was brought the delaware environmental agency 
issued a new permit for texaco that takes into account the higher 
iron discharges esposito said 
the court has not entered any judgment on liability and the 
company has not decided if it will appeal said john ambler 
texacos senior coordinator of public and government affairs 
ambler denied the company was at fault 
he said texaco contends that the discharges at question were 
due to sampling errors and some acts of god storms upset the waste 
water treatment process 
ambler said that the 390 samples found to be in violation were 
out of tens of thousands and were only slightly above 
permitted levels 
since 1985 the refinerys waste water treatment plant has 
been in over 99 percent compliance he said 
texacos refinery located in delaware city about 12 miles south 
of wilmington refines gasoline chemical feedstocks petroleum coke 
for utilities and gases for fuel ambler said texaco is based in 
white plains ny

texas air corp may consider selling part of its 
continental airlines subsidiary chairman frank lorenzo said 
thursday 
the surprise announcement comes a week after a boston investment 
firm disclosed that it owns 12 percent of houstonbased texas air 
the nations largest airline company texas air owns both 
continental and strikebound eastern airlines 
texas air said it has retained drexel burnham lambert inc as an 
investment adviser to discuss any transaction 
in a statement released late thursday texas air said in 
answer to a question at a company management conference today 
lorenzo said that the company may consider sale of a minority or 
controlling position of its continental airlines unit and that it 
has had discussions with parties who have expressed an interest in 
continental 
art kent a spokesman at continentals houston headquarters 
declined to comment further on the statement 
last week loomis sayles amp co a boston portfolio management 
company said its 12 percent stake in texas air was held for 
investment because it believed the company would show a profit in 
1990 
miamibased eastern is in the midst of chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization the carrier filed for protection on march 9 five 
days after its machinists pilots and flight attendants went on 
strike since then it has been rebuilding as a smaller airline 
using nonunion workers 
lorenzo followed a similar path with continental in 1983 
while there are some arguments in favor of seeing continental 
emerge with new ownership such as giving the company access to 
stronger financial or marketplace resources there are also a number 
of compelling reasons why a sale of the company may not be 
advisable lorenzo said in thursdays statement 
one of the principal reasons against selling is that the carrier 
is emerging from a period of consolidations with other airlines as a 
stronger company and shows potential for improved financial results 
he said

a federal judge on thursday barred the energy 
department from awarding a 1 billion contract to a bechtel corp 
unit to build and manage the proposed nuclear waste dump in nevada 
the decision is a setback for attempts by energy secretary james 
d watkins to end years of delay and political squabbling over the 
waste dump project preliminary studies of whether the yucca 
mountain site is suitable to hold the nuclear waste had been 
scheduled to start earlier this year 
us claims court judge reginald gibson permanently enjoined the 
department from awarding the contract to anyone other than trw inc 
which sued the department on grounds that the process of selecting 
bechtel was tainted 
the department said in a statement it was disappointed and will 
review the departments options 
the department said it did not believe the ruling would 
significantly affect its ability to carry out preliminary studies of 
the areas geology to determine whether it would qualify for a 
required nuclear regulatory commission license 
the nevada state government which strongly opposes the project 
applauded the ruling 
to the people of nevada this is a further indication of why 
the people of nevada do not trust the department of energy when it 
says the selection of yucca mountain is based on science and not 
politics said larry henry press secretary to gov bob miller 
this case severely weakens the does credibility 
the actual opinion issued by gibson was not immediately made 
public but the gist of the decison without explanation was 
contained in a brief memorandum to the parties in the suit 
gibson said the opinion would be kept secret at least until next 
wednesday to allow the companies involved to determine whether the 
document contains any proprietary information or trade secrets that 
should not be made public 
at issue in the case is a charge by trw which lost in a bid for 
the contract that energy department officials involved in selecting 
bechtel systems management inc were guilty of a conflict of 
interest 
trws contention centered on the fact that samuel rousso who had 
a hand in selecting bechtel had previously worked for science 
applications international corp a subcontractor to bechtel 
the energy department said immediately after gibsons memorandum 
was issued that it was preparing a public response it said rousso 
was not available to comment 
at bechtel headquarters in san francisco spokesman rick 
laubscher said the company was very disappointed at the ruling 
but had not yet seen the actual opinion nor conferred with the 
energy department 
we have to do those things before we can speak knowledgeably on 
the matter laubscher said 
spokesmen for trw in cleveland and washington were not available 
for comment their offices said
