the socialist party leadership on monday 
strongly suggested president kurt waldheim should step down but 
stopped short of calling for his resignation 
chancellor franz vranitzky party chief fred sinowatz and other 
party leaders also renewed an indirect offer to support a 
conservative candidate to be nominated for presidential elections 
if waldheim quits 
the resolution adopted by the socialist leadership meeting said 
the report of a historians commission on waldheims service in the 
german army during world war ii had badly shaken the presidents 
moral authority at home and abroad 
it also said that a televised speech by waldheim on feb 15 
has raised doubts about his ability to integrate austrias 
opposing political camps 
in that speech waldheim said he would not step down and 
dismissed as wrong unspecified parts of the report earlier this 
month by the international panel of historians that probed his 
wartime past 
waldheim 69 has consistently denied any wrongdoing as a first 
lieutenant serving in the german army in the balkans during the war 
the resolution said the socialists are ready together with the 
conservative peoples party junior partner in the coalition 
government to look for a way toward a new beginning in the 
office of federal president 
asked whether this meant that the socialists would agree to a 
joint conservative presidential candidate sinowatz told reporters 
this certainly includes also the question whether a personnel 
change is possible 
economics minister robert graf and other leading officials of 
the conservative peoples party last week expressed increasing 
uneasiness in the party about the damage being done to the country 
if waldheim clings to his post waldheim elected in 1986 ends his 
term in 1992 
the historians commission presented no evidence that would 
clearly back allegations waldheim committed atrocities but it left 
open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime 
it said he was in close proximity to some nazi atrocities in 
the balkans knew they were going on and made no attempt ot prevent 
them it also said waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to 
make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it

eight million americans can be wrong 
thats how many people bought bon jovis album slippery when 
wet which spent 38 weeks in the top 5 of the album charts and 
churned out three hit singles 
but the boys from new jersey received a goose egg from the 
national academy of recording arts and sciences which deemed 
slippery when wet worthy of zero grammy nominations and its 
not just the platinumhaired platinumsellers the academy ignores 
critical favorites can and often do suffer the same fate 
the beatles one of the most popular and prolific musical 
entities of the century were often ignored by the academy winning 
only four grammys as a group the rolling stones have never won a 
grammy 
rem the acclaimed band from athens ga broke nationally with 
their document album and its single the one i love their 
album also received no nominations however the lp cover was 
nominated for best album package 
an assortment of artists from john cougar mellencamp to the 
beastie boys missed out on musical nominations for the march 2 
show at radio city music hall passed over by a membership which 
once more opted for studio craft over originality and vision 
wrote los angeles times music critic robert hilburn 
you know what it is its just the way it is you cant fight 
city hall said rocker richard marx who was snubbed for a best 
new artist nomination on a technicality 
it does tend to be the same kind of people every year he 
said a lot of times its the people whove been on the cover of 
time or the real mainstream people the artistic people are passed 
over many times 
for marx it was an obscure track he recorded for a bmovie 
soundtrack that prevented his new artist nomination a similar 
controversy arose in 1986 when the academy refused to nominate 
whitney houston in the best new artist category because she had 
recorded duets with jermaine jackson and teddy pendergrass she 
went on to win the best female pop vocal grammy for saving all my 
love for you 
but crosby stills amp nash who won the award in 1969 had been 
vocalists and songwriters in the byrds buffalo springfield and the 
hollies cyndi lauper who won in 1985 recorded as lead vocalist 
with a group called blue angel before her shes so unusual lp 
and freddie jackson who was nominated in that category in 1986 
had been a part of a recording group called mystic merlin 
nevertheless singer jody watley who scored several hits while 
recording with the band shalimar was nominated as a new artist 
this year 
i was upset for about five minutes when i found out then i 
thought well no big deal ill get nominated for a grammy 
someday said marx who wound up nominated this year for best 
rock vocal with his track dont mean nothing 
his competition in that category includes joe cocker tina 
turner bob seger and superstar bruce springsteen but even the 
boss was a victim of the fickle grammy selection process 
springsteens tunnel of love his first studio album in 
three years was passed over for album for the year honors but 
paradise by the c an old tune recycled on springsteens 
fiverecord live set inexplicably received a best rock 
instrumental nomination 
in fact springsteen has received only one grammy award despite 
such multimillion selling and critically hailed albums as born to 
run the river and born in the usa 
as for mellencamp his fine the lonesome jubilee received no 
nominations mellencamp received a conomination for producer of 
the year with his studio partner don gehman 
springsteens office has declined to comment on the nomination 
process which is handled by the 5000member naras the selection 
of nominees and the winners annually produces complaints from those 
passed over although many artists remain philosophical about the 
whole process 
look at all the people who won in the best new artist category 
in the past the starland vocal band a taste of honey said 
marx that award can be the kiss of death

harold thomas works in a junkyard six days 
a week tearing apart old cars and rebuilding the engines the 
other day is spent working in the fields at a churchrun orphanage 
where his benefactors have volunteered his service 
roy gilman 75 and his wife ethel 68 gave him the job and a 
chance to leave the leanto he was living in last month with other 
homeless men in chicago 
they gave him the old 8footby30foot trailer home at the 
junkyard that he shares with a stray cat hes named cleo 
they have their son ralph drive him to church on sundays 
they pay for his groceries but they havent paid him any wages 
yet 
those gilmans believe in working thomas says adding that a 
paycheck will probably come when business picks up 
a month from now itll be planting season he says i 
think ill do good im fed im healthy im working 
room and board are thomass pay for now ralph gilman says 
thomas will be paid when he gets where he can do anything i 
think were going in the hole part of the time now 
thomas is a stranger in a strange land and the circumstances 
that brought him here on jan 16 were just as strange 
before he arrived in this ranching and farming community of 
about 11000 people on the flat high plains of eastern new mexico 
thomas lived in a rotting wood and canvas shack along the chicago 
river he didnt have a job and he got his meals when he could a 
2inch scar across his forehead is testimony to a fight he says 
started in a soup line in chicago 
the gilmans read of thomas plight in an associated press story 
published in the portales newstribune in january contacted the ap 
bureau in chicago and said if thomas was willing to work theyd 
provide him with a home and a job 
by the time thomas 35 was on a westbound greyhound people had 
donated new clothes new luggage and spending money 
thomas isnt completely at ease in his new surroundings 
he isnt quite sure how people will react to him 
he shunned a suggestion of one restaurant for dinner saying 
hed heard rough cowboys hung out there 
thomas likes to talk about his past he speaks with animation of 
his days as a wanderer traveling through the south looking for 
work 
he speaks also of a future when he will own his own ranch 
but for now he goes to work at the junkyard each day and says 
he enjoys the time he spends in the fields at the orphanage 
when the director of the orphanage drives up to the remains of 
an old corral that thomas is sawing into firewood thomas quickly 
extinguishes his cigarette in his calloused hand saying putting it 
out is the respectful thing to do 
new mexico is nice and warm he says i want to stay here 
and try to make something out of this opportunity 
i aint getting no younger i want to settle down 
since his arrival thomas has received dozens of letters from 
women whove read of his good fortune and want to share life with 
him from homeless people wishing him well in his new life from 28 
fifth graders in corrales nm 
the gilmans also get letters mostly commending them for 
offering thomas the opportunity to work again and to have a roof 
over his head 
thomas a burly 5foot10inch former carpenter answers his 
letters particularly those from the women i get lonely for a 
woman he says 
mrs gilman saves her letters in a notebook that she likes to 
show visitors 
people in the community have been receptive to thomas she says 
but adds so many people want his place if he doesnt work out 
if he doesnt get started drinking hell be all right 
thomas isnt drinking he cant go out to bars at night because 
the 16yearold car the gilmans gave him doesnt have an engine 
yet but hes learning the skills hell need to get it in working 
order 
ralph gilman says thomas is a good worker but still needs time 
to adjust to his new job 
some things could be better he says i think theres a 
communication gap but a bunch of that is probably my fault he 
cant read my mind 
a lot of it is the way hes lived gilman says his brain 
has worked on survival for the last couple of years hes got to 
develop it for this now 
thomas begins each day at 8 am by helping feed the half dozen 
cows that also live at the junkyard 
when warm weather comes hell help with ranching chores on the 
approximately 2000 acres the gilmans own in several tracts 
hes not completely satisfied i can tell ralph gilman 
says other days things are good theres ups and downs 
thomas says the downs come mostly when he begins missing his 
longtime girlfriend and her 16yearold daughter he helped raise 
they live in a government housing project in chicago 
i want to help my stepdaughter out shes pregnant he says 
id like to try and save my money and do something for my own 
id like to bring them down here 
i never knew id end up like i did he says i hope i 
dont end up in a slump like that again that aint no kind of life 
for a man

playing in public in 1978 because he needed a short rest 
cliburn broke his long silence with a white house performance 
during decembers summit meeting between president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
to be honest i never thought the intermission would go on 
for 10 years cliburn said in an interview published in sundays

invitation to accompany the new york philharmonic on its first tour 
of the soviet union in 15 years

in her saturday night live heyday gilda 
radner poked fun at people and just about everything else but when 
she learned 17 months ago that she had cancer she found life was 
not as funny 
cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world radner 
said in an interview in marchs life magazine but it doesnt 
have to mean you die 
although radner had lost much weight and hair during her 
chemotherapy she has a new attitude today 
radner needs little provocation to yank up her sweater and 
show off her newly fat stomach and after eight months of 
baldness her unruly brown hair with a bit of gray at the temples 
has grown back in a thick thatch according to the magazine 
she has also stopped smoking and eats more wholesome food 
twenty years ago the average life expectancy of a patient with 
ovarian cancer was between six and seven months it is still the 
most lethal of pelvic cancers with less than a 30 percent recovery 
rate 
although radner 41 will not be considered well unless her 
remission continues for at least 1 years she said i think ive 
never been as healthy and as well as i am now 
she credits her turnaround to her excruciating medical 
treatment which included surgery nine months of chemotherapy 
injections and 30 radiation sessions 
her 52yearold husband actor gene wilder said each time 
gilda had to go through one more treatment and shed be vomiting 
and writhing in pain id ask myself how much can a human being 
take 
had wilder not been around radner is certain she could not have 
taken so much the magazine said wilder has not worked since she 
was diagnosed 
radner also credits meetings shes attending with the wellness 
community a cancer selfhelp group 
and shes working three hours a day on a book about cancer 
thats what one of my favorite visualizations is about she 
said every day i imagine myself sitting in doubledays with 
people lined up to have me sign my book im well and im 
adorable

jimmy swaggart didnt spare the 
fireandbrimstone when fellow tv evangelists jim bakker and marvin 
gorman fell from power last year he criticized them for their 
style as well as their sexual dalliances 
god deliver us from these pompadour boys hair done nails 
done fresh from the beauty shop preaching the gospel he 
thundered in march at a california crusade 
swaggart who temporarily stepped down from his own ministry 
sunday amid allegations of sexual misconduct has a less polished 
more explosive fundamentalist style it sprang perhaps from his 
upbringing in ferriday a backwater town in northern louisianas 
bible belt 
it was there he has said when he first heard the call of god 
a voice that gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle 
he was 8 years old 
everything seemed different after that day in front of the 
arcade theater he said in a 1985 interview i felt better 
inside almost like taking a bath 
he grew up poor and learned to play the piano and sing along 
with two cousins who took different paths rock singer jerry lee 
lewis and country singer mickey gilley 
parttime preaching and parttime work in oil fields provided 
his living until he was 23 when he gave up the oil work he 
preached played piano and sang gospel songs with all the 
barrelhouse fervor of his cousin jerry lee at assemblies of god 
revivals and camp meetings for 16 years before starting a radio 
show that launched his broadcast evangelism career 
he was always outspoken 
in literature issued by his ministry he calls roman catholicism 
a false religion it is not the christian way whosoever follows 
its errant doctrines will be deceived and end up eternally lost 
of jews he wrote that because of their rejection of christ 
they have known sorrow and heartache like have no other people 
on the face of the earth 
if you dont like what i say talk to my boss he shouted 
once as he strode in front of his congregation at his family 
worship center where his sermons often move listeners to stand up 
as though possessed by the holy spirit and start speaking in 
tongues 
offensive to some swaggarts messages still moved many 
contributors built jimmy swaggart ministries into a growth industry 
that made an estimated 142 million in 1986 swaggart said in 1985 
that his complex in baton rouge including a worship center bible 
college and stateoftheart broadcasting and recording facilities 
was worth up to 75 million 
swaggart has said the ptl scandals of last year hurt 
fundraising because the public painted all evangelists with a 
broad brush 
as the scandal broke swaggart assured his followers that he 
wouldnt fall into the same trap as bakker and gorman a new 
orleans minister 
in his baton rouge worship center in march he told his flock 
that if he were ever unfaithful to his wife frances she would 
kill me before god could even get to me 
on sunday swaggart never specifially responded to reports that 
he too had been accused of sexual misconduct specifically 
consorting with a prostitute but as his tearful followers looked 
on he turned to his wife and said god never gave a man a better 
helpmate a companion to stand beside him i have sinned against 
you and i beg your forgiveness

this town of cobblestone streets and 
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in india but 
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their 
sins in its holy lake 
pushkar is a place revered by hindus and even by some foreigners 
who seek out its tranquility 
its beginnings lie with lord brahma the creator of the universe 
in hindu mythology hindu texts have it that when brahma was 
seeking a place for a holy ceremony he chose pushkar 
he dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the 
desert to form a lake according to the texts that date from the 
8th century bc 
in these modern times as the sun rises hindu pilgrims chant 
mantras and take a dip in pushkar lake believing all their sins 
will be washed away by the holy waters 
europeans and americans often are seen by the lake sharing the 
religious experience they feed grain to pigeons and sweets to 
longtailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the towns 
400 temples where ascetics hindu monks and other holy men gather 
pushkar a town of 9000 people is an oasis of tranquility far 
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of bombay new 
delhi and calcutta 
the blazing sun soaks into everything 
it was the sacred month of kartik signifying the onset of 
winter when lord brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom 
brahma foremost in the hindu trinity of supreme gods had been 
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony 
but his wife savitri could not attend the ritual angered she 
decreed that henceforth brahma would be worshiped at only one place 
pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of 
creation while millions of shrines were erected across india to 
lord shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like kali and 
durga who are often depicted as firespitting images carrying heads 
of evil men they had slain in battle 
but this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for 
the hindus almost equal in importance to benaras the eternal 
city hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in 
benaras 
pilgrims come by the thousands to pushkar 250 miles southwest 
of new delhi to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of 
brahmas majestic rite every year on kartik poornima the full moon 
night in the month of november 
shielded by nag pahar or serpent mountain pushkar has indias 
and perhaps the worlds only temple to brahma 
the town centers on the lake where there are several steps for 
bathing signs warn foreigners not to wear shorts and other 
revealing clothes not to smoke drink near the lake or take 
photographs not to kiss embrace or indulge in other irreverent 
acts 
the steps called ghats are controlled by vigilant and 
aggressive brahmin priests who preside over religious ceremonies 
armed with horoscopes they watch every pilgrim approaching the 
lake and pounce on potential clients 
each visit is recorded in their bulky clothcovered books a 
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited 
pushkar by referring to the dogeared notebooks 
displeasing a priest can be unpleasant he will pronounce curses 
on ones entire family naming all the grandfather father and 
sons 
from the lake the steps lead up to the main street a favorite 
shopping center with the tourists the shops are stacked with 
exotic handicrafts peasant skirts and other clothes native to this 
part of india velvet shirts and pajamas musts for lowbudget 
travelers hang in vibrant displays

george vassiliou elected as cyprus 
fourth president since independence from britain 28 years ago had 
never belonged to a political party or been involved in political 
activity until he decided to run for office 
the 56yearold millionaire businessmen ran as an independent 
backed by the moscoworiented communist party akel which controls 
about onethird of the votes among the 363000 voters on the greek 
cypriot side of the divided mediterranean island 
on sunday he defeated a veteran conservative politician to 
become the nations leader 
until his campaign vassiliou concentrated on his research and 
marketing company worth about 5 million it is the largest in the 
middle east 
the campaign was a first for the communists as well until this 
poll the party had always supported centrist candidates never 
fielding its own man 
but the millionaires endorsement by the communists was not as 
contradictory as it sounds his parents vassos an eye doctor and 
phofo a dentist were founding members of the party in 1941 
his father took the family to greece in 1945 to fight on the 
communist side in the civil war 
the proeuropean vassiliou has stressed his political 
independence from the communists particularly on foreign policy 
and is expected to adhere to cyprus nonaligned status 
the election of the urbane vassiliou an economist who speaks 
seven languages breaks the greek cypriot nationalists grip on 
power since independence 
the islands first president archbishop makarios hero of the 
independence struggle in the 1950s was elected for three fiveyear 
terms with huge majorities 
his successor spyros kyprianou was considered his political 
heir and served for two terms but only with akel support which 
was withdrawn in 1985 
vassilious election breaks the mold he has said his first 
priority is to break the deadlock between greek and turkish 
cypriots and seek to reunite the island 
it has been divided since the turkish army invaded in 1974 
after a shortlived coup by militant supporters of union with 
greece that installed nicos sampson as president for eight days 
all efforts to find a political settlement have foundered but 
vassiliou has said he will form a national unity government and is 
willing to reopen negotiations without preconditions 
vassilou who was born in famagusta now part of the breakaway 
turkish cypriot republic in the northern third of the island was 
educated in london and budapest hungary he is married with three 
children

pop artist andy warhol who gained fame by 
calling fame fleeting has proved otherwise by his death 
a year after his fatal heart attack in a new york hospital 
warhols legacy is a mirror of his life a melange of high art low 
kitsch dramatic tension and as much as ever the gaze of a 
fascinated public 
its going to take a while still for his legacy to be sorted 
out said david bourdon an art critic and warhol biographer 
but if anybody thought he was going to be a flash in the pan 
they are quite mistaken 
artistically scrutiny of warhols work has risen to a level it 
probably never attained in his life major film and painting 
retrospectives are in the works as are several biographies and the 
publication of his private journal 
socially the cultish lifestyle in which warhol enveloped 
himself will be unwrapped this spring at a huge auction of the 
artists possessions from old master paintings to a superman 
touchtone phone 
commercially the managers of warhols estate have signed a 
licensing agreement that principals say could create a 
billiondollar business in retail goods from calendars to towels 
bearing warhol images 
and legally in its least expected ramification warhols death 
continues to reverberate in the medical world the state has 
accused new york hospital of rendering him deficient care and his 
estate has sued over his death 
what would he think of all this as far as the brouhaha is 
concerned its consistent with the way he lived action tension 
all those kinds of things said edward hayes lawyer for the 
estate but in terms of his death hed probably just think his 
death was stupid 
warhol 58 died in his hospital bed early feb 22 1987 the 
day after a surgeon removed his gall bladder pathologically 
fearful of hospitals and distrustful of doctors he had put off the 
surgery for years 
his death remains an enigma the city coroner was unable to say 
what caused warhols heart to stop and the state health 
department while citing deficient care did not say the problems 
such as inadequate supervision of nurses and incomplete 
recordkeeping harmed him 
there are cases when cardiac arrest is unexplained this will 
probably be one of those cases said diana goldin spokeswoman 
for the hospital which maintains that warhol was well cared for 
in some ways the inconclusiveness of warhols death is fitting 
his life was equally enigmatic a mix of nightclubbing and 
reticence public persona and intense privacy counterculture 
innovation and determined marketing 
the everyday object was his icon the provocative phrase his 
byword in the future said warhols famous assertion in a 1968 
exhibition catalog everyone will be worldfamous for 15 
minutes 
he was an incredible character said bourdon there are 
just so many conflicting stories and irreconcilable anecdotes i 
dont think it can ever be sorted out i think hes just going to 
evaporate into legend he wanted it that way facts were always a 
little unglamorous to him 
but in the absence of warhols own brand of glamor his 
ethereal blackdraped whitewigged presence what remains is the 
reality of his art 
you take a look at the work and the personality becomes less 
of an issue said barbara haskell curator of the whitney museum 
of american art the social presence that he projected is no 
longer part of the evaluation and one can look at the work more 
clearly 
that appraisal is going on intensively as often happens after 
the death of an artist the whitney plans a spring retrospective of 
warhol films the museum of modern art is preparing for a major 
show of warhol art next year it will tour worldwide at least four 
books on his life are due out soon 
he tried to cultivate a twodimensional persona now when one 
begins to see the depth of who he was it becomes more 
intriguing said haskell he is far more significant than he 
allowed his public to believe 
there are some signs already of the increased value of warhols 
work at auction in october a warhol painting that was expected to 
sell for 70000 went for 220000 another with an estimate of 
50000 sold for 176000 
those sums pale in comparison to the potential value of an 
agreement between warhols estate and schlaifer nance amp co the 
marketing firm behind the cabbage patch kids dolls warhol who 
often blurred the line between fine and commercial art had started 
the discussions with schlaifer two years ago 
the company may put his name and images on bedding cosmetics 
paper goods jewelry a huge range of retail items whose sales it 
has said could reach the billiondollar level warhol may have 
approved being good in business he wrote in 1975 is the 
most fascinating kind of art 
but for all the marketing schemes and planned art shows 
warhols legacy may make its brashest statement in april and may 
when sothebys auction house sells the entire eclectic assortment 
of artworks and knickknacks that cluttered his manhattan townhouse 
proceeds will fund a foundation for the visual arts 
the sale is classic warhol the sixvolume catalog selling for 
95 is sothebys costliest ever and the first to be sold in 
advance in bookstores nationwide the pieces include 134 pottery 
cookie jars a rolls royce a few important modern art works 
sothebys forecasts a 10 million to 15 million sale other 
estimates are more than twice that the crowd of bidders is sure to 
glitter 
the artist his friends say would have loved the fuss but in 
his own unrevealing way 
theres been a much heightened interest naturally said 
fred hughes his longtime manager and now executor of his estate 
warhol was a hard guy to figure out his reaction but i think he 
would have taken it in his stride

rescue workers recovered eight 
victims and rescued 13 people late sunday beneath a massive 
mudslide in rio de janeiro which has been hit by three days of 
pounding rains 
at least 74 people died and 11000 were left homeless by the 
violent storms since friday which turned streets into raging 
torrents threw cars like toys and carried ramshackle homes roaring 
down hillsides civil defense officials said early monday 
authorities estimated 50000 people eventually may have to be 
relocated throughout the city army trucks and volunteers helped 
transport slum dwellers from precarious hillside homes to temporary 
shelters in schools churches and public buildings 
in some cases people refused to leave their partially destroyed 
homes preferring to ris being crushed beneath their homes than 
leave their worldly possession 
health officials promised mass vaccinations against tetanus and 
typhoid and warned residents against an outbreak of leprosy which 
followed a similar spate of rainstorms earlier this month 
from above one has the impression a giant stepped through the 
city smashing homes and hillsides said mayor saturnino braga 
who called the threeday onslaught the citys worst disaster 
civil defense officials estimated saturday that as many as 150 
people were killed in the rains that began late friday but the 
figure on sunday lowered to 48 and later raised back to 74 
twenty more people were believed missing beneath mud and debris 
including at least eight more people at the santa genoveva 
hospital rescuers recovered the eight bodies and 13 people alive 
from the nursing home in the upscale hillside neighborhood of santa 
teresa where a threestory wing of the hospital was crushed by a 
mudslide saturday 
its hard to have an accurate view of the number of dead 
said civil defense spokesman bruno avila we have no idea how 
many people have been burried by their shanty town homes nor do we 
know exactly how many were in the santa genoveva hospital at the 
time it was stuck though we imagine some 30 of the 350 patients 
died 
torrents raged down streets throughout the city prompting some 
people to tie their cars to posts to prevent them from being swept 
away civil defense workers used amphibious vehicle and surfboards 
to pluck people from partially submerged cars 
rivers and drainage canals overflowed pushing dozens of shanty 
homes from their precarious hillside perches 
much of the damage was inflicted on the slums that hold about 2 
million of the citys 7 million residents but wealthy areas also 
suffered heavy damage 
in the santa teresa district an eightfloor apartment building 
was evacuated and threatened to topple engineers said evacuations 
were ordered after flooding hit the wealthy gavea lagoa and jardim 
botanico districts 
vice mayor jo rezende said he has asked the federal government 
for 4 million to clean up city streets relocate slum dwellers and 
repair embankments and streets washed away by the waters 
i cant even imagine what will happen to this city if the 
rains continue rezende told the jornal do brasil radio the 
situation is desperate we estimate 50000 people will have to be 
given new housing in safer areas 
public schools were used as shelter for the estimated 10000 
homeless avila said supermarkets were asked to donate food and 
doctors were asked to report for duty 
globo the countrys biggest private television network carried 
news flashes every 15 minutes to solicit donations of time food 
and medication 
meteorologists said the downpour was caused by an antarctic cold 
front that likely was to continue through monday 
health secretary jose noronha told rio residents to boil their 
drinking water and said the government would carry out vaccinations 
against typhoid and tetanus he said 69 people had been 
hospitalized since the beginning of the month with leprosy a 
disease carried by rats and contaminated water 
five have died of the disease noronha said on jornal do brasil 
radio 
earlier this month 207 people died in flooding and mudslides 
around the state and 13000 were left homless the worsthit area 
was petropolis a mountain resort town 40 miles north of rio

investigators in motorboats raked the 
bottom of a shallow pond at raleighdurham airport on sunday 
pulling up debris that may be a clue to a commuter plane crash that 
killed 12 people 
no one survived friday nights crash of american eagle flight 
3378 which went down shortly after takeoff en route to richmond 
va 
because of debris found in the water investigators believe the 
twinengine turboprop hit the pond before plunging into a wooded 
area and exploding officials said sunday evening earlier they 
had said the plane had barely skimmed the pond a flood reservoir 
before crashing 
parts of the plane including a portion of the hydraulic system 
were found within 40 feet of the bank said national transportation 
safety board member james l kolstad 
he also said that investigators believe the 28yearold first 
officer kathy digan was flying the plane when it crashed friday 
because the captain walter cole was talking to the control tower 
when the plane took off 
the person that does the flying doesnt usually do the 
radio kolstad said 
ms digan who was hired by american eagle last may had 2150 
total flying hours and 450 in the metroiii the craft type 
involved in the crash 
she was qualified kolstad said there is no doubt about 
that 
weather at the time of the accident although poor was not so 
severe as to endanger the flight visibility on the runway was 
between 2400 and 3000 feet when the crash occurred the flight 
could have taken off down to 1600 feet kolstad said 
earlier ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said officials hoped 
that the search of the reservoir would show how the plane broke 
up it helps determine the sequence of events 
about 25 investigators including some from the ntsb sifted 
through the ropedoff wreckage site on the ponds bank peering at 
small bits of debris and examining larger plane parts for signs of 
malfunction 
beyond them men in lifejackets piloted two motorboats around 
the surface of the pond using poles and hooks to retrieve small 
pieces of crash debris the pond measured about 4 feet deep and 75 
yards wide officials said 
the debris will be used to determine the state and angle of the 
plane when it struck the bank since the aircraft carried no flight 
data or cockpit voice recorders lopatkiewicz said neither is 
currently required by the federal aviation administration on 
commuter aircraft although they will be as of march 1989 he said 
if it was flying upsidedown that tells you something he 
said 
some trees were broken and others were skinned as much as 200 
yards beyond the water when the aircraft hit the wooded bank the 
wreckage including the entire silver tail was strewn over an area 
measuring about 50 feet by 150 feet lopatkiewicz said 
rubble and bits of shiny metal still littered the tall grass 
the largest plane piece a red white and bluestriped shard from 
the fuselage measuring about 15 feet lay amid several broken pine 
tree trunks wheels from the landing gear had broken off their 
axle while about 30 yards away a piece of the aircrafts 
emergency door lay twisted in the mud 
the remains of the 10 passengers and two crew members were 
removed saturday night from the crash site and taken to the north 
carolina medical examiners laboratory in chapel hill said teresa 
damiano an airport spokeswoman 
officials were using fingerprints to help identify the victims 
she said

for more than 20 years the lights of this 
western maryland community have shimmered with national pride 
as the lights of lavale flicker at dusk a nearperfect outline 
of the united states begins to shine brightly from this residential 
community nestled in the foothills of the alleghenies 
its an unusual happenstance no one tried to make it said 
carson dowell who has lived for 25 years atop haystack mountain 
where the map is best viewed on a cold clear winter night im 
not sure who discovered it my wife mentioned it to me she 
couldnt believe it 
a shopping center forms the uscanadian border a welllighted 
thoroughfare around lavale is the west coast the east coast is 
about a mile of motels fast food restaurants and stores along us 
40 
its beginning to get a litle busy and distorted because of 
all the development in the lavale area said cindy snyder who 
also lives in the 124home sunset view development on the mountain 
as you come down the east coast florida is starting to get a 
little out of proportion 
back five 10 years ago it was probably a little better 
she said were not knocking the development but were losing 
our united states 
maine is formed where us 48 disappears behind a mountain 
ridge the southern edge of lake ontario is a bowling alley a 
disfigured florida appears where us 40 vanishes around haystack 
mountain and the gulf coast is a grouping of homes and other 
establishments 
its the united states of america from sunset view said 
david dorsey a planner with the allegany county planning and 
zoning commission i guess just about everyone has heard of it i 
dont know if everyone believes it 
the residential community of more than 7200 has experienced a 
rush of commercial and residential development especially since 
the 1960s dorsey said 
we were worried about the mall when it opened up in 1981 
but its actually a big hawaii said gary ruddell a businessman 
who lives in the area theres no alaska we have to do some more 
development 
ruddell past chairman of the sunset view civic association 
said the map is best seen in the winter when leaves have fallen 
from trees on haystack mountain about nine months ago members of 
the association thought about topping some trees to provide a 
better view but scrapped the idea in favor of more pressing needs 
he said 
some residents expressed concern that publicity would attract 
sightseers to sunset view and create traffic but others said most 
local residents either have already seen it or have no interest in 
getting a glimpse of america in lights 
sometimes at night people stop out in front and you wonder 
what theyre doing dowell said but then you know what theyre 
doing theyre looking at the map 
i remember one time its been years ago one of my 
neighbors called and said theres someone down in your garden 
with a tripod surveying dowell said they werent surveying 
they were down there taking pictures of the map

after 30 years of handling people in crisis 
the suicide prevention center has a crisis of its own half the 
telephone hotline workers have walked out in a dispute over layoffs 
and control of the center 
the workers went out on jan 1 and it has been a sometimes noisy 
dispute with striking counselors picketing the centers offices 
and chanting down with the board during a recent closeddoor 
meeting of directors 
despite the walkout the crisis line handled more calls in 
january than it did the same month a year earlier executive 
director sheila halfon said 
in fact the strike has prompted people to come forward to ask 
if the center needed their help 
we were deluged with calls from people who read about it and 
asked how could they volunteer halfon said 
in addition to the crisis line the center operates a substance 
abuse clinic a halfway house an aids research project an art 
therapy program and an annual curriculum for schools on substance 
abuse and suicide 
before the layoffs the center excluding crisis line workers 
had about 90 full and parttime employees the crisis line was 
staffed by about 80 volunteers and consultants the latter are 
workers who started out as volunteers but have begun to receive 
parttime 6anhour shifts 
the crisis line workers walked out when 27 of the noncrisis 
line staffers were laid off and the hours of 15 others were cut 
back late last year 
the layoff was strictly a budgetary concern halfon 
asserted though she admitted the timing was terrible you know 
december 
the centers budget in 198586 was about 3 million including 
revenue from contracts grants clinic fees and donations she said 
but in the last year some grants have ended and contracts that 
provided government funding have not been renewed she said 
estimating the current budget at about 15 million 
we are concerned with fulfilling that she said the 
cutbacks in just the layoffs will result in a savings of half a 
million dollars 
the strikers however are particularly upset that among those 
laid off was the centers first employee social worker sam heilig 
who served as a clinical consultant 
we cant function without a clinical person in control 
phyllis meisler a spokeswoman for the strikers said recently 
the dismissal of one of the most well known and most 
experienced persons in the area of suicide prevention doesnt make 
much sense said norman l farberow a psychologist who 
cofounded the center in 1958 
heilig did not return a telephone call for comment 
in 1984 farberow and the other founder dr robert e litman 
turned the center over to a board of directors composed of local 
business people so that they could focus on research 
but the founders who have remained as clinicians want to 
regain control of the center 
the board of directors met feb 7 to deal with the centers 
problems 
halfon said the directors favored putting a member of the crisis 
line staff on the board but she would not reveal what moves the 
board would take to resolve the overall problem of ultimate 
administrative control of the organization 
thats the part thats in question whats the best way to 
preserve the integrity and assets of the organization

five months after the fbi fired him former 
agent john c ryan is grappling with a religious renewal that 
caused him to question his past challenge his supervisors and lose 
his job 
wholesale changes are taking place in the life of a man who was 
10 months away from settling into a quiet retirement when he was 
dismissed sept 11 
after carrying a gun every day during 21 years of loyal fbi 
service ryan now is a pacifist who denounces the immoral 
activities of the fbi and the united states involvement in 
central america 
ryan 49 is selling his peoria home where he and his wife 
peggy raised four children and hes pondering a total change in 
lifestyle while searching for a way to support his family the next 
12 years until he can collect his federal pension 
it would be inconsistent for me to continue being a heavy 
consumer knowing how many victims the american lifestyle demands 
ryan said recently theres war in latin america so we can 
continue to eat big macs and i dont want to contribute to that 
were scaling down our lifestyle to a more simplified life 
his only income comes from speaking engagements and from 
teaching a sociology class at bradley university legal fees to 
fight his dismissal have eaten 13000 out of the family savings 
perhaps part of the reason for the change in lifestyle 
clad in sneakers and jeans ryan hardly resembled the man who 
spent two decades in foreign counterintelligence investigating 
organized crime in new york and hunting fugitives like antiwar 
activist daniel berrigan 
his work twice won him commendations but something was missing 
from his life a devout roman catholic who once studied for the 
priesthood ryan started taking religious study courses about 10 
years ago 
he earned his masters degree in 1985 and the transformation 
from a follower of j edgar hoover into a pacifist began to mature 
it was then that ryan knew his beliefs would conflict with his 
role as chief counterintelligence operative in the fbis fiveman 
office here but he never really thought it would lead to his 
dismissal 
refusing an order was something id never done before and i 
knew an act of insubordination would cost me some sort of 
disciplinary action ryan said i have religious beliefs they 
are bound to accommodate there are office jobs places i could 
work in the fbi i wouldnt have to carry a gun 
i think they overreacted in firing me it was stupid look at 
all the notoriety it has caused 
ryans life is in turmoil but he seems content with his 
decision to refuse an order to investigate an antinuclear group 
suspected of vandalizing 11 chicagoarea military recruiting 
offices 
i really feel i did the right thing ryan said i dont 
know if i could have lived with myself had i done anything 
differently 
his firing occurred 10 months before his 50th birthday in june 
when he would have been eligible for full retirement with 20 years 
service 
i could have simply ignored the order but i chose not to i 
felt what we were doing was clearly investigating peace groups with 
the obvious intention of intimidating and harassing them i thought 
the fbi was illadvised to do this and i told them 
despite his change of heart the fbi negotiated with ryan and 
offered to reinstate him with back pay in december on the 
condition he never speak of the case again he said he signed an 
agreement and mailed it to fbi headquarters but for some reason the 
deal collapsed the fbi has refused to say why 
this month an administrative judge in st louis ruled the fbi 
was justified in firing ryan 
at a hearing ryan said he could not take a human life even if 
his or another persons life was endangered he believes that was a 
key reason his dismissal was upheld 
ryan still hopes to reclaim his job and his pension and an 
appeal is planned

the mother of a man accused of bursting 
into a defense company and shooting seven people to death said 
shes saddened by the waste of life and wants to send sympathy 
cards to the victims families 
i wish those people would know how badly we feel mina belle 
farley said in an interview published sunday i dont know if it 
would help to send cards but we could tell them how sad we are 
about all of this 
mrs farley 70 also said she was shocked to learn that her 
son richard wade farley was charged with seven counts of murder 
in tuesdays shootings at esl inc offices in nearby sunnyvale 
wed never had any problems with rick she told the san jose 
mercury news in a telephone interview saturday from her home in 
henderson texas about 100 miles east of dallas 
mrs farley and her husband thomas who is retired from a 
career in the air force learned of the shootings and their oldest 
childs arrest the next day after they tried to contact him in san 
jose 
neither farleys parents nor any of his five brothers and 
sisters have heard from him since the attack she said 
we dont communicate much said mrs farley who hasnt seen 
her son since a trip to california 1 years ago 
she also said her son never mentioned 26yearold laura black 
an esl employee who authorities describe as the unwilling object of 
farleys romantic fantasies 
farleys fouryear obsession with the electrical engineer is 
believed by authorities to be the reason for the rampage he was 
fired in may 1986 for harassing black who went to court for a 
restraining order to stop him from following calling and writing 
her authorities said 
black was one of the three people who were shot during the 
rampage but she survived she remained in stable condition at 
stanford university medical center where she is expected to remain 
for several more days 
farley remained under 24hour surveillance at the santa clara 
county jail sheriffs lt mike fine said he was quiet and polite 
besides the seven murder counts farley is charged with three 
counts of attempted murder he could face execution if convicted

a fire roared through a crowded house early 
sunday killing two children and three mentally retarded adults and 
injuring four other people authorities said 
the fire apparently started near a wood stove and the rural 
twostory house was in flames by the time firefighters arrived 
charlotte county investigator wh gholson said 
phenix firefighters were aided by neighboring departments from 
redhouse and brookneal but the blaze destroyed the house 
there were 11 people in the house at the time the fire broke 
out officials said jackie hamlett one of the two who escaped 
unhurt identified the victims as helen schofield 49 dennis 
jones 21 ruth berger 64 amir hall 3 and rashanda carrington 
18 months 
we tried to get the people out of there for 20 or 30 
minutes said chief walter bailey of the phenix volunteer fire 
department then the fire and the heat got to be too much and i 
had to pull everybody back 
beatrice vaughan 84 was listed in critical condition sunday 
night at lynchburg general hospital with burn injuries three other 
occupants were treated and released gholson said 
the home was owned by helen barrett who was among those who 
escaped with minor injuries gholson said 
ms barrett said the three adults were mentally retarded wards 
of the state and she was paid by charlotte county social services 
to take care of them she said they had lived in her home for as 
much as 16 years and were relatively selfsufficient 
leddie fuller director of county social services could not be 
reached for comment early monday telephone calls to her home went 
unanswered 
bailey said the fire apparently started after ms barrett added 
wood to the stove and returned to bed 
we dont know if it was a defective flue or if there was 
combustible material near the stove right now we think it probably 
came from a spark that flew out 
ms vaughan discovered the fire when she went downstairs to warm 
up bailey said 
she got burned by the fire and thats when barrett and 
resident cathryn hamlett came in and tried to put it out with a 
fire extinguisher then they started with buckets of water but 
they couldnt do anything to it 
ms barrett and cathryn hamlett went to a neighbors house 
where they called the fire department they were both treated and 
released 
officials said cathryn hamlett was ms barretts daughter and 
some of the other people in the house were related but they 
werent sure of their exact relationship they said the only 
retarded adults who were wards of the state were apparently the 
three adults who died 
four bodies were recovered but the body of the younger child 
who had been sleeping on the second floor had not been found 
bailey said

panama has spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars since 1985 hiring american lobbyists to champion the 
countrys cause in congress and improve its image in the united 
states records show 
among those who have registered as agents of panama are stuart 
spencer a longtime political adviser to president reagan mb 
oglesby jr former white house assistant for legislative affairs 
francis gomez an executive with ties to lt col oliver norths 
network and jamie whitten jr the son of rep jamie whitten 
dmiss 
the documents are filed at the justice department in compliance 
with the foreign agents registration act the law requires foreign 
agents to report their activities every six months 
many foreign governments hire lobbyists to help learn about the 
complicated us bureaucracy in recent years the practice has 
attracted congressional scrutiny particularly when former 
government officials sell their inside knowledge to foreigners 
raul st malo a spokesman at panamas embassy said the 
government no longer employs any american lobbyists and the 
records indicate that many contracts have lapsed 
relations between the two countries have deteriorated sharply 
since gen manuel antonio noriega the countrys dominant figure 
was indicted on drug smuggling charges in miami this month 
one of the most recent filings covering the period through 
december 1987 was made by gomez a former state department 
official and onetime business partner of richard r miller an 
associate of norths 
gomezs company public affairs resources inc was paid nearly 
145000 between july and december 1987 by a panamanian business 
group set up in august 1986 to promote tourism exports 
investment and an improved image for panama 
the group impulso turistico y financiera de panama is headed 
by robert cordovez gomez said cordovez is a businessman with 
ties to people in the government 
panamanian opposition figures including roberto eisenmann the 
editor of the newspaper la prensa said cordovez is close to 
noriega eisenmann lives in exile in miami 
for his money gomez worked extensively with the panamanian 
embassy the documents show among his duties edited articles 
written by embassy officials and made copies of newspaper 
articles speeches and letters as requested by the embassy 
the 21000 a month contract with impulso was first signed in 
september 1986 by international business communications a 
nowdefunct firm run by miller and gomez

soliciting contributions for the rebels there is no indication 
that gomez worked with north 
north an exnational security council aide was fired in 
november 1986 for his role in using money secured through the sale

and he no longer works with miller 
some major firms such as bill hecht and associates which 
employed spencer and oglesby and daniel j edelman inc lost 
their contracts with panama in 1986 a year in which panama came 
under increasing attack from us officials 
secretary of state george p shultz registered concern in june 
1986 about allegations that noriega engaged in drugtrafficking and 
gunrunning and sen jesse helms rnc called noriega the 
head of the biggest drug trafficking operation in the western 
hemisphere us aid to panama ceased in late 1987

a 15year search for meteorites in 
antarctica has turned up thousands of meteorites including six 
from the moon and one possible rock from mars scientists say 
those seven meteorites solid bodies that travel through space 
and survive passage through the earths atmosphere have been the 
focus of years of scrutiny by scientists looking for insight on the 
composition of the two heavenly bodies 
it has always been assumed that a lot of material should be 
falling off the moon from meteoritic impact said ursula b 
marvin a geologist at the smithsonian institutions center for 
astrophysics here we suspected that some of our meteorites came 
from the moon before the apollo missions 
marvin was part of the us expedition that discovered the 
plumsized rock weighing about four grams in january 1982 
japanese scientists have located five lunar meteorites in 
antarctica scientists also are building a case for martian 
origin of the meteorite found in 1979 
comparing the 1982 find with lunar samples collected by american 
astronauts scientists found the meteorite closely matched highland 
materials returned by the apollo 15 16 and 17 crews 
analysis indicated that the fragment was blasted away from the 
moon by an asteroid impact about 100000 years ago and hurled to 
earth 
the 66yearold marvin who also teaches parttime at harvard 
university said the lunar meteorite probably was traveling in 
space for between 1900 and 2500 years before crashing through the 
atmosphere and landing on the antarctic ice 
the antarctic rock believed to be from mars spent about 10 
million years in space 
some of the 1000 moon rocks retrieved in the apollo missions 
have been dated at more than 4 billion years old a short time by 
geologic standards 
xrays and gammarays of the moons surface taken by apollo 
orbiters have led scientists to believe the lunar meteorite may 
come from a crater on the fareastern rim of the moon or on the 
unexplored dark side marvin said 
we went to six places on the moon and the russians sent 
unmanned landers to three places she said we have no exact 
location for this composition anywhere 
annual us meteorite expeditions to antarctica occur in the six 
weeks of the year when the continent is bathed in sunlight 24 hours 
a day 
the national science foundation the national aeronautics and 
space administration and the smithsonian provide equipment and 
financing for research for the meteoritic expeditions said marvin 
who has has made three trips to the 5millionsquaremile continent 
to search for meteorites 
she said that since manned moon exploration stopped after the 
apollo 17 mission in 1972 meteorite searches are crucial 
its one of the most vital and productive aspects of the space 
program marvin said as a matter of fact in planetary 
exploration its the only show in town this all gives us more 
information without actually going up there about the evolution 
of the moon as a body

a foulsmelling mist came rolling into 
atwater calif on the night air silently blanketing a row of 
homes on the outskirts within an hour townsfolk were staggering 
into the emergency room 
environmentalists point to the june 1 incident which they 
contend was caused by pesticides sprayed on nearby peach orchards 
to fuel their arguments that the nation must do more to control the 
poisons 
the senate agriculture committee is set to try once again to 
overhaul the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act 
fifra the primary law providing for regulation of the compounds 
pesticides are now a 5 billionayear industry tomatoes beef 
potatoes apples pork and many other foods arrive at the dinner 
table laden with chemicals in a number of states pesticides have 
been found in groundwater often used for drinking 
chemical makers contend that the benefits of pesticides outweigh 
the risks they say drinking a glass of well water where 
contamination has been measured poses less hazard than downing a 
shot of vodka 
however there are some 113000 cases of pesticiderelated 
illness and injury logged each year a may 1987 national academy of 
sciences report said cancer is caused in laboratory animals by 30 
percent of the insecticides most likely to show up in food 50 
percent of the herbicides and 90 percent of the fungicides 
congress has moved fitfully at best to tighten regulation of the 
1 billion pounds of pesticides sprayed on us fields annually in 
the war on bacteria fungi bugs worms mice and other forms of 
crop blight 
critics ridicule fifra as hopelessly toothless we call it a 
nolaw law because it doesnt do anything consumer advocate 
ralph nader says 
a 1972 rewrite of fifra gave the environmental protection agency 
until 1975 to complete a reregistration process including a 
fullscale safety review of some 700 pesticides in 1975 
lawmakers approved a oneyear extension in 1978 the deadline was 
junked altogether 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
now estimates that at the present crawl the job wont be completed 
until the year 2024 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
and sen richard g lugar rind have proposed a nineyear 
deadline for the reregistration process plus a possible twoyear 
extension 
i think most americans are willing to put up with a spot on 
their lettuce or a blemish on their apple rather than risk 
cancer says leahy 
the national agricultural chemicals association champion of the 
nations pesticide makers has no objection to a speedup in itself 
more complex issues however are lying in the legislative weeds 
and could rise up to scuttle the bill something similar happened 
in 1986 when a seeming compromise came unglued just before congress 
adjourned 
chemical companies are willing to contribute to the costs of 
reregistration by paying 150000 per ingredient but the 
leahylugar bill calls for 750000 which the naca calls a money 
grab pure and simple 
under current law companies are entitled to indemnities from 
epa to compensate for the banning of their products already the 
agency has paid 24 million to chemical makers for taking the 
pesticide edb off the market and 18 million for a chemical known 
as 245t or silex 
and the agency estimates it will pay out between 60 million and 
155 million in indemnities and disposal costs to get rid of a 
pesticide called dinoseb the annual budget of the entire epa 
pesticide program is 70 million 
the leahylugar bill would bar such indemnities unless congress 
passed an individual money bill for each one such a measure is 
guaranteed a rough time on capitol hill the industry is firmly 
opposed 
manufacturers have other objections as well especially to an 
amendment leahy cosponsored with sen david durenberger rminn 
naca president jack d early told the agriculture committee that 
the leahydurenberger amendment contains an unrealistic ground 
water definition unenforceable goals for water quality standards 
and an unworkable state ground and surface water protection 
program 
of the main legislation he said the plan to require separate 
money bills for indemnities would ultimately be bad for 
agriculture because there is no guarantee that agricultural 
users will recoup their losses 
however one incentive to action is a provision that would 
extend patent rights for chemical manufacturers 
the 1986 bill passed by the house also included provisions that 
would preempt states from setting more stringent safety standards 
than those of the federal government and exempt agricultural 
producers from cleanup liability under the environmental laws they 
were rejected by the senate when it fashioned its own version 
in the house the agriculture and the energy and commerce 
committees are fighting over jurisdiction of the bill 
some fifra critics such as rick hind of the us public 
interest research group declare in disgust that it will take a 
disaster to get the house moving on pesticide legislation but 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas scoffs at that notion 
we dont need a disaster he says we know what we have to 
do

eleven cars of a 133car union pacific 
railroad freight train derailed and spilled an acid solution into a 
creek threatening the water supply for thousands of people 
authorities said 
no one was injured in sundays derailment in which one car 
spilled about 13000 gallons of phosphatic fertilizer solution 
containing phosphoric acid into the creek leading to the lamine 
river said walter fussner a union pacific spokesman 
the lamine river which feeds into the missouri river is the 
water source for nearby boonville a town of nearly 7000 
residents officials shut off the water intake valve to the 
community as a precaution and residents were asked to conserve 
water said lt becky loesing of the cooper county emergency 
operations office 
the jefferson city water department was monitoring its water 
supply from the missouri river 
phosphoric acid can irritate the skin and respiratory system 
said larry alderson environmental emergency specialist with the 
missouri department of natural resources 
a 50man cleanup crew worked into the night with backhoes and 
bulldozers to clean up and neutralize the acid trace elements of 
the acid were found in the lamine river but no fish were killed 
fussner said 
fussner said the cause of the accident which occurred shortly 
before noon two miles from the missouri river was under 
investigation 
union pacific officials called a cleanup contractor who built a 
dam to try to prevent the fertilizer from further contaminating the 
lamine river lime was hauled in to neutralize the acid alderson 
said 
fussner said the railroad encountered problems because the spill 
was in a remote area no roads lead to the area and all supplies 
were being brought in by train 
the train was traveling from east st louis ill to north 
platte neb when the accident occurred near this central missouri 
town

premier jacques chirac long mired in third 
place in opinion polls has seen his presidential campaign take 
off giving him an edge over rival conservative raymond barre with 
two months left before the vote 
the first round of the election april 24 has become in effect 
a primary election between chirac and barre unless there is a 
stunning turnaround one of the two will oppose a socialist 
probably incumbent president francois mitterrand in the decisive 
may 8 runoff for a sevenyear term 
policy differences between chirac and barre are few and minor 
so the campaign has focused on the contrasting personalities of the 
two men and what their political advisers increasingly call le 
look 
there is certainly no need for the voters to discover the 
candidates mitterrand has been a major national figure for 40 
years barre and chirac for 15 years each 
its a question of sentiment who looks better and talks 
better said bertrand louapre a barre supporter interviewed on 
the edges of a cocktail reception during a chirac campaign swing 
wednesday through reims capital of the champagne country northeast 
of paris 
personally ive chosen raymond barre said louapre a 
construction engineer mr chirac has certainly taken off faster 
he has much stronger support from his party 
chirac a rangy almost hyperactive figure then displayed his 
formidable skills as a campaigner moving swiftly through the 
crowd but often stopping to grasp the hands of his supporters 
briefly in his own oversized hands 
i think the premier is closer to people and thats what will 
make him win political science professor alain redslob author 
of a book on chirac said in an interview i think theres a 
strong movement beginning to lift off 
the barre style is that of a fairly cold man who has wanted 
to give himself an image of rigor bernard pons chiracs 
minister of overseas territories recently said in a radio 
interview he is a man who is fairly secret and who 
frequently makes decisions alone 
barre a rotund economics professor who had never run for public 
office when he began his fiveyear term as premier in 1976 is 
widely respected but inspires little enthusiasm he prides himself 
on telling people what they need to know whether or not they want 
to hear it 
they tell me to offer the french people a dream barre told 
a campaign rally in the southwestern city of poitiers on wednesday 
but to dream one must first go to sleep i love my country too 
much i respect my fellow citizens too much to lend myself to 
that 
barre says chiracs government which took over from the 
socialists in march 1986 has made some good moves he says he 
would take stronger action to boost french industry 
mitterrand has long had a solid lead in all published opinion 
surveys while chirac trailed barre thoughout last year a poll 
published jan 16 the day chirac declared his candidacy gave 
mitterrand 41 percent to 25 percent for barre and 185 percent for 
chirac 
but surveys published in the past two weeks have shown chirac 
pushing ahead fridays edition of the magazine parismatch for 
exampale reported 23 percent of those questioned planning to vote 
for chirac to 19 percent for barre mitterrand who says he will 
wait until midmarch to disclose his plans remained far ahead with 
36 percent 
the questions were posed for parismatch and a radio network by 
the polling firm bva which between feb 14 interviewed 1316 
people who said they intended to vote no margin of error was 
disclosed 
barre who insists on his independence from all political 
parties is supported by the union for french democracy a loose 
grouping of five centerright parties that is part of chiracs 
governing coalition 
the main event of chiracs fivehour visit to reims was a 
campaign rally that drew 7000 supporters to a new exposition hall 
in the suburbs many arrived in buses chartered by chiracs party 
the rally for the republic frances most efficient political 
machine 
rather than give a speech chirac answered questions from three 
men and two women chosen to raise issues of concern in the region 
he defended frances agricultural policies and promised to 
improve schools and universities so that students learn skills they 
need to find jobs he also said he hoped to increase family 
allowances to mothers of three or more children to the minimum 
wage about 825 a month because they deserve it 
the first question asked of chirac who is juggling duties as 
mayor of paris premier of france and member of a regional council 
in southcentral france was how he can do all the work 
im an optimist by nature he replied which probably 
gives me more energy to face problems

the fund which helps pay for treatment of children suffering from 
cancer

feet fatigue and boredom 
its torture said marc baskin a junior management major 
from glen cove ny

you can do it said tammie rutherford a sophomore business 
management major from white plains ny

hobbled and weary dancers as they endured the final leg of the 
marathon 
tom west a sophomore sports medicine major from west long 
branch nj taped feet iced ankles and treated blisters from a 
trainers table off the dance floor 
some people come in and their feet are just flat said west 
explaining that fallen arches were the most frequent physical 
malady 
carol stelmach a junior marketing major from baltimore said 
she and other dancers had a tactic for keeping their minds off 
their feet 
you have to do something that makes you think of your hands

the final hours of the marathon clapping and cheering 
dugan said this years marathon was the most financially 
successful in the events history 
james h brucker director of development for the medical 
center said the marathon is the single biggest source of income 
for the four diamonds fund 
last year the dance marathon raised 297000 dugan said

democrat richard gephardt who has made 
its your fight too his populist rally cry has chosen this 
state as a staging ground for a bid to block michael dukakis from 
sweeping the handful of states holding presidential primaries or 
caucuses before super tuesday 
south dakota and to a lesser extent wyoming are the states 
chosen by the gephardt campaign for an intensive effort even as the 
threeweek campaign for the south and its rich pool of delegates 
has already begun 
according to the calendar and the democratic partys nomination 
rules south dakota might not appear a major battleground its 
primary was set for tuesday earlier than national democratic 
officials wanted it only after agreement was reached that means 
the states nominating delegates wont be selected until later and 
wont be bound by the primary outcome 
but gephardt has attached far more significance to south dakota 
boarding a jet to fly here just as the sun was starting to rise 
wednesday morning on his badly needed secondplace finish in new 
hampshire 
you have a powerful voice in the election in 1988 gephardt 
told a group of senior citizens in sioux falls on the opposite end 
of the state 
sen paul simon of illinois his campaign on the ropes after 
finishing behind the missouri congressman in iowa and new 
hampshire has chosen minnesota and south dakota to make what could 
be his last stand 
he said at one point that if he didnt win in south dakota or 
in minnesotas caucuses which also are held tuesday he will drop 
out of the race but then backed off on that assertion citing a 
surge of donations 
gephardt strategists however say it is not simon but dukakis 
that they regard as their bigger concern in those two states 
coming as he does off a big victory in new hampshires primary last 
tuesday 
that is in part because gephardt would like to have a primary 
victory before heading into the 20state contests on march 8 
perhaps more importantly however his campaign would like to block 
dukakis from gaining the state and going into the south with one or 
even more victories under his belt from outside his native new 
england 
they do not want dukakis to have the suggestion of inevitibility 
riding on his side should gephardt or one of the other candidates 
fail to stop him 
there are five states holding primaries or caucuses between now 
and the contests across the south on super tuesday they are 
sometimes referred to in the jargon of the campaign trail as the 
lesser antilles or the gateway states to super tuesday 
a boost from any of these five gateway states would give us a 
boost to super tuesday said ali webb gephardts press secretary 
the contests include maines caucuses feb 26 and vermonts 
beautycontest primary march 1 the gephardt campaign is conceding 
the new england states to dukakis governor of nearby massachusetts 
gephardt attended a debate in minnesota last week but isnt 
otherwise competing in the state arguing that its caucus system 
and internal party divisions make it too confusing to spend time 
competing 
gephardt brought close to 20 paid staffers from south dakota to 
iowa as soon as iowas caucuses were finished they have purchased 
40000 in television commercials in the statess two major cities 
rapid city and sioux falls an amount of money small by other 
states standards but regarded as large in the state of fewer than 
threequarters of a million people 
internal polling conducted by the gephardt campaign wednesday 
night showed dukakis was leading in the state by a ninepoint 
margin with no other candidates close but it also showed the race 
was largely uniformed in the state less than a week before the 
voting 
another candidate albert gore jr of tennessee has been 
quietly at work in south dakota and wyoming too even as he 
concentrates on the states of his native south he has ads on the 
air in south dakota and has visited wyoming several times 
another reason for concentrating here is that gephardt forces 
believe the states should respond nicely to his populist message 
an assertion the nation is in economic decline in part because of 
unfair trade practices by asian countries 
gephardts support for an oil import fee is considered a plus 
particularly in wyoming where a large oil industry remains 
hardhit by depressed prices 
he stressed that at a small rally in casper wyo last week 
and seemed to strike a chord among the audience 
barb reese a member of the county democratic executive 
committee said she saw gore speak in wyoming a week or so earlier 
but found gephardt more appealing she said she was wavering and 
might back gephart rather than go along with an effort by state 
party leaders to back an uncommitted slate 
i was really set on being uncommitted in the caucuses because 
i thought it was best for wyoming she said but she said im 
impressed

house negotiators are making plans to scuttle 
a trade retaliation plan authored by democratic presidential 
hopeful richard gephardt but the missouri congressman is vowing to 
fight for his amendment 
conferees plan to strip the provision from a housepassed trade 
measure in an effort to save the overall bill according to 
congressional leaders 
but lawmakers suggest that as a courtesy to gephardt the 
conferees will wait until after the march 8 super tuesday primary 
elections before formally abandoning the proposal 
the gephardt provision will be dropped were going to dump it 
because its bad policy said rep sam gibbons dfla chairman 
of the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means committee and 
a member of the housesenate conference committee hammering out a 
compromise trade bill 
the gephardt plan calls for trade retaliation against japan and 
other trading partners that maintain large trade surpluses with the 
united states the omnibus trade legislation it is attached to has 
languished in congress since last fall 
gephardts a nice fellow and hes got a lot of friends here 
gibbons said were kind of proud of him but were not going to 
make his amendment law 
gibbons and other house leaders said that once super tuesday is 
past the house conferees will move quickly to get rid of the 
gephardt provision regardless of how he does in those primary 
states 
gephardt said he has no intention of dropping his push for the 
amendment that bears his name 
im going to fight for my amendment he said as he 
campaigned in south dakota on sunday i think it will make it 
through the conference committee 
the missouri congressman who has made trade issues a key part 
of his presidential pitch was asked if rejection of the amendment 
would hurt his campaign lets see what the result is before we 
jump to conclusions he said 
conference leaders have held off on moving ahead on the measure 
to await the results of the early presidential contests in part 
because gephardts amendment is such a major part of the house bill 
president reagan opposes the imposition of retaliatory trade 
measures by congress and the white house has said he will veto the 
trade bill if it contains gephardts amendment 
twenty states hold democratic primary elections on march 8 with 
13 in the south where trade is a major issue because of 
importbattered textile and other local industries 
however with recent signs that the nations stubborn trade 
deficit is finally easing under the pressure of a weaker dollar 
which makes us goods more competitive overseas political 
sentiment has been shifting in congress away from tough retaliatory 
sanctions 
last octobers stock market plunge which underscored the 
fragility of world financial markets has also subdued some of the 
most vocal calls for protectionist measures on capitol hill 
the gephardt measure passed last spring by the house is aimed 
particularly at japan it would require mandatory retaliation after 
a sixmonth period if those negotiations prove fruitless then a 
10 percent a year reduction in the offending nations trade surplus 
through tariffs or quotas would be required 
trade analysts suggest that as long as the gephardt amendment is 
a central part of the house bill action on trade this year is 
likely to remain paralyzed and the better gephardt does in the 
primary campaigns the harder it will be to win agreement on any 
compromise trade bill 
actually democratic leaders have said privately for some time 
that at some point the gephardt amendment would have to be 
dropped 
however deciding just how to go about it with the presidential 
election year in full swing has all but frozen action on the trade 
measure until now 
addressing the aflcio executive council in bal harbour fla 
last week house speaker jim wright dtexas predicted that the 
conference panel would agree on something in between gephardts 
proposal and the milder senate version 
the senate bill calls for formal investigations that could lead 
to sanctions against nations running large trade surpluses but 
would not require blanket retaliation

burst into tom hedgecocks apartment early saturday according to 
jim solomons a spokesman for the orange county sheriffs office 
gregory m farmer and joseph roehrick were being held without 
bail after being charged with burglary and seconddegree murder 
under a state law that permits such prosecution for those involved 
in a felony resulting in death 
it was pretty traumatic said the 27yearold hedgecock who 
was shot in the leg 
solomons said hucek roehrick 22 and farmer 25 spotted 
hedgecocks roommate when they were out driving late friday 
the three thought that the roommate kurt chaillet had 
something to do with the theft of an expensive leather jacket that 
belonged to one of them solomons said 
chaillet 25 joined the three for driving and beer drinking and 
later took them back to the apartment where they confronted him 
with their suspicions and demanded to search the apartment 
solomons said 
the search which turned up no leather jacket quickly turned 
into a ransacking and the noise woke hedgecock solomons said 
he told them to get out solomons said when they refused 
hedgecock armed himself with a screwdriver and forced them out 
he locked and bolted the door but the three kicked in the door 
and pushed their way inside where hedgecock had armed himself with 
a crossbow 
he fired once striking hucek in the chest and killing him 
the violence continued as chaillet ran to call authorities the 
fight between farmer roehrick and hedgecock moved into the parking 
lot where roehrick pulled a gun from his truck and shot twice 
hitting hedgecock in the leg solomons said 
when deputies arrived they found farmer and roehrick in the 
parking lot and hedgecock sitting on his couch

the union representing 4500 pan am ground 
employees in 14 cities vowed guerrilla warfare against the 
airline after talks in which management is seeking 35 million in 
concessions broke down 
the pan american world airways reservation clerks and other 
ground staff represented by the teamsters continued working sunday 
after the unions 1201 am strike deadline passed 
we can strike any time we want said william genoese 
director of the teamsters airline division 
were going to pick our strategic time genoese said 
meantime he said teamsters would attempt to disrupt operations 
through guerrilla warfare starting immediately 
theres going to be trouble on the job he said theyre 
not going to correct anybodys errors theyre not going to help 
anybody theyre not going to do anything for anybody 
but a pan am spokesman jeff kriendler called genoese the 
jerk and said his words were completely ridiculous 
whereas the leadership may be at warfare with pan am the rank 
and file are completely loyal to the company it is not in their 
hearts to turn their backs on their customers kriendler said 
and kriendler added any workers taking part in that warfare 
would face discipline in the severest form 
a federal mediator said both sides told him they would act on 
his request to reevaluate their positions 
the board will stay in touch with the parties and there will 
be a resumption of negotiations at an early and appropriate time 
said walter c wallace of the federal mediation board 
negotiations began late saturday at wallaces request and 
continued for six hours past the strike deadline when talks broke 
off sunday morning teamsters leaders promised that union members 
reservation clerks customer service agents and other clerical 
staff would continue to work 
the talks resumed in the afternoon at pan am headquarters here 
but recessed after about a halfhour when the company rejected the 
mediators call for arbitration genoese said 
the dispute involves pan ams attempts to cut costs by 35 
million through concessions by the teamsters the airline has said 
it needs about 540 million in concessions from its unionized 
employees during the next three years to ensure its survival 
asked about the major points of contention kriendler said 
lets say that the company long ago established a 35 million 
objective of achieving cost reductions what is negotiable is how 
we reach the 35 million figure 
the company does not view the amount as negotiable kriendler 
said but the union maintains that it is 
the company said it would maintain operations with replacement 
workers in the event of a strike the transport workers union voted 
friday not to support a teamsters strike and pilots flight 
attendants and flight engineers were not expected to honor picket 
lines 
the teamsters represent workers at airports in boston detroit

israeli foreign minister shimon peres says he 
is concerned about the soviet role in setting up arabisraeli peace 
talks even as the soviets pledged to be more of a factor in 
negotiations 
peres who favors an international conference to quell the 
violence in the occupied west bank and gaza strip voiced doubts 
about soviet involvement in arranging such a conference 
the deaths of two arabs sunday brought the number of 
palestinians killed by israelis since the protests began dec 8 to 
61 according to un figures 
what role the russians will play depends on what role the 
international conference will play peres said sunday in an 
interview from jerusalem on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley 
i would never agree that any foreign country russia or other 
country will make decisions instead of us or will try to force us 
to make a decision peres said i dont accept the russian 
concept that an international conference should be an authoritative 
conference i think it should be an authorizing conference namely 
enabling the parties to negotiate among themselves freely 
peres said he understood that jordan egypt israel and the 
united states share this view 
the foreign minister said the conference should be like 
somebody that opens the door to a new era but not somebody who 
replaces the residents in the house itself 
peres also acknowledged sunday that he sent a handwritten note 
to attorney general edwin meese iii in 1985 about a proposed iraqi 
pipeline 
peres who was israels prime minister at the time previously 
has denied writing to meese that he supported the 1 billion 
540mile pipeline project which was never built 
meanwhile in moscow soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze prior to meeting with secretary of state george p 
shultz said that his government wants to play a more active role 
also in the negotiations 
shultz who travels to israel later this week met with soviet 
officials to discuss the next superpower summit meeting between 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the 
iraniraq war and the conflict in the middle east 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel has resisted soviet 
participation in the search for a middle east settlement in 
addition to not having relations with israel the soviets generally 
support arab positions 
the soviets broke relations with israel after it defeated egypt 
then a soviet ally in the 1967 mideast war however a small group 
of soviet diplomats was sent to israel last year to take care of 
some consular matters 
peres emphasized the urgent need for negotiations 
im convinced that the time has really come which shouldnt 
be postponed to start to negotiate and find a solution which will 
answer the expressions of the palestinians on one hand and the 
security call of israel on the other he said 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin interviewed on cbstvs 
face the nation welcomed us efforts to set up talks on 
resolving the mideast crisis and never was asked about a soviet 
role 
i believe its a very good idea to bring about a beginning of 
a talking rabin said after all the problem that we face can 
be solved only by political means by military means by force we 
can bring about tranquility but not a solution 
we have a very great respect and trust to secretary shultz we 
believe that he is honest decent human being and is trying his 
best to bring about a beginning of a talk 
former secretary of state henry kissinger who appeared on the 
abc program said negotiations should be conducted under us 
auspices and not soviet authority 
i have the gravest doubts about an international conference 
kissinger said i have grave doubts about a soviet role unless 
the soviets are willing to ask of their arab friends what we are 
going to propose to our israeli friends so i think that american 
mediation is the best course

president daniel ortega charged that 
us lawmakers who are seeking to secure additional aid for the 
contra rebels are egotistically toying with nicaraguan lives 
ortega said in a twohour speech to the national assembly on 
sunday that despite a feb 4 vote in the house of representatives 
against a reagan administration request for more contra aid this 
chapter has not closed 
president reagan he said will look for a way to get more money 
to the rebels by calling the assistance humanitarian aid 
if the us congress approves that type of financing it 
would be erasing the word peace that it wrote when it voted against 
the funds and would be putting in the word war ortega said 
in the speech broadcast over a government national radio network 
that is the little game of congress a congress where many 
interests particularly egotistical are involved and which is 
playing with life hunger security and the selfdetermination of 
the nicaraguan people he said 
the house voted against reagans plan to give the contras a 
362 million aid package that included about 36 million for 
weapons and ammunition to help them in their 6yearold fight 
against the leftist sandinista government 
democrats prevailed in the vote 219211 after the partys 
leadership promised members there would be a later chance to vote 
on a package of contra aid for food clothing medicine and shelter 
only 
a group of democrats together with one or two republicans who 
voted against the presidents plan have been trying to draw up 
such an alternative 
one proposal for the alternative aid request would give the 
contras humanitarian aid at a rate of about 18 million a month 
ortega said 26500 people have been killed since the war began 
and 23882 wounded other unofficial sources have put the death 
toll at more than 40000 the war he said has cost the country 
36 billion 
damage to the economy was estimated at 376 million last year 
exceeding the 270 million in export earnings he said 
even so he said the economy advanced at an inflationadjusted 
rate of 17 percent in 1987 it contracted 04 percent in 1986 
the inflation rate skyrocketed to 1347 percent last year well 
ahead of the 657 percent of the previous year 
the government last week unveiled a new program to try to 
control runaway inflationm it introduced a new cordoba currency 
boosted prices of basic goods increased salaries and cracked down 
on speculators

the reagan administration is likely to find 
out during a visit by portuguese prime minister anibal cavaco silva 
this week if a proposed 46 million increase in military aid 
satisfies portugals request for more compensation for us use of 
a major air base 
cavaco silvas first trip to washington since he took office 
last august is expected to be dominated by discussion of the base 
situation which has injected a dose of sourness into an otherwise 
sweet relationship between the two nato nations 
portugal is getting 117 million in us assistance this fiscal 
year in nato only turkey and greece got more but that was 30 
million less than the fiscal 1987 payment 
in the budget sent to congress last week portugal would get 
163 million 
portugal wants 207 million a year which us negotiators 
pledged in 1983 they would make their best efforts to provide 
in return for a baserights agreement that gives the united states 
access to lajes air base in the midatlantic azores islands 
besides being part of the nato chain of bases lajes is viewed 
by the pentagon as an indispensable refueling point for mammoth 
transports heading for the middle east and africa 
the grumbling in lisbon is similar to noises being heard in the 
philippines greece turkey and spain allies seeking more 
benefits from the united states in return for use of military 
installations 
security cooperation is an important part of the relationship 
between the united states and portugal and obviously will be 
discussed during the prime ministers visit the portuguese 
embassy said in its announcement of cavaco silvas meetings which 
include talks with reagan on wednesday 
there will be further discussions about promised economic 
assistance the embassy said 
under the terms of the base rights agreement portugal has the 
right to demand a review of the pact at its midterm which occurs 
this month the form of the review is not spelled out but us 
officials have said it could result in a demand by portugal for 
specific amounts of additional aid 
after defense secretary frank c carlucci visited lisbon feb 
34 the two countries announced an agreement under which portugal 
would hold off calls for a formal review of the pact and the united 
states would supply surplus military equipment to compensate for 
the aid cutback 
since then however the agreement has come under attack 
portuguese president mario soares said the surplus equipment 
agreement is unsatisfactory 
in a speech last thursday portuguese foreign minister joao de 
deus pinheiro said he favored an update of the defense accord 
officials of both countries notably pentagon and state 
department officers sympathetic to portugals requests and 
frustrated by budget strictures have said the dispute is purely 
financial 
unlike in spain and greece where the voters support a reduced 
us military presence there is widespread support for the 
american bases in portugal 
the upcoming portugueseamerican negotiations shouldnt be 
dramatized pinhero said our common interests and views far 
exceed any possible bilateral difficulties

the new pentagon budget has reopened the 
bitter fight between congress and the reagan administration over 
the mx nuclear missile and how to build americas future arsenal of 
landbased atomic weapons 
and in the latest round on a possible successor to the mx 
missile past administration critics have gained grudging support 
from an unusual quarter defense secretary frank carlucci 
although he personally doesnt think much of the midgetman 
missile the congressionally designated heir apparent to the mx 
carlucci has agreed to request enough funding to keep the project 
alive until a new administration can make the final decision 
the budget sent to the democraticcontrolled congress last week 
proposed 807 million to buy a dozen more of the 10warhead mx 
weapons along with 793 million for a new method of basing the 
giant missiles aboard trains 
the current plan is to put 50 of the weapons into silos on 
warren air force base in southeastern wyoming the air force also 
wants to build 50 more and deploy two each aboard 25 
speciallybuilt trains 
but carlucci told the senate armed services committee last week 
that if it were up to him he would put all 100 mx weapons on the 
trains 
we badly need a survivable missile system he explained 
that statement echoed criticisms by mx opponents who claimed 
during a series of long fights in reagans first term that putting 
the mx into landbased silos would make the missiles vulnerable to 
a first strike by accurate soviet missiles 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger strongly disagreed 
and pushed hard for approval for 100 of the weapons they were to 
replace some of the aging minuteman missiles which now make up the 
heart of americas landbased nuclear missile force 
after a series of long fights congress finally agreed to put 50 
of the weapons in landbased silos and then approved the 
singlewarhead midgetman weapon as a successor to the mx the air 
force agreed with that plan but later reagan decided to try to win 
approval for the second 50 mx weapons 
even as the budget was unveiled thursday mx critics were lining 
up to oppose the railroadbasing plan 
the debate concerning survivability has been raging for years 
and apparently will continue said rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass one of the chief opponents of the weapon in reagans first 
term 
based on the available data serious questions remain 
regarding the safety and survivability of that type of deployment 
system said mavroules because of these lingering questions 
congress must be concerned about the rashness of this proposal 
another critic rep les aucoin dore said rail garrison 
would be vulnerable to more than soviet missiles because 
commercial rail lines would be used the threat of terrorism and 
sabotage must be considered serious 
additionally in light of the recent problems surrounding the 
safety of our nations rail system it is not pleasant to 
contemplate the thought of nuclear warheads being trundled around 
through populated areas 
both mavroules and aucoin promised to try to eliminate all money 
for the railbasing plan 
carlucci also said he wanted to kill the midgetman program 
because budgetary restraints made it necessary to choose between 
midgetman and the mx but to meet a congressional request he 
included 200 million to keep the program alive until a new 
president takes office next year 
that met with the approval of sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee and a midgetman supporter 
i felt it would be a mistake to zero the program and i wanted 
it kept alive for the next administration this money seems to me 
to meet that request said nunn who helped defeat an attempt to 
kill the midgetman program two months ago 
of the 50 mx weapons to be deployed 33 are now in their silos 
but only 20 of those are operational because of problems in 
delivering the guidance systems but carlucci said that all 50 will 
be in the silos by the end of 1988

cars and trucks capable of switching from one 
fuel to another could discourage future oil price increases by 
foreign producers the energy department says 
the department says dualfuel motor vehicles in sufficient 
numbers on american highways would offer that benefit even if the 
foreign oil producers also supplied the second nonpetroleum fuel 
in the first of a series of reports planned for this year on 
alternate fuels the department says enough twinfuel vehicles 
would have to be in use to switch away from about 1 million barrels 
of oil a day 
the united states uses almost 17 million barrels of oil per day 
a bit more than a third of it imported and fiveeighths of it 
devoted to transportation 
it would take a decade of spending several billion dollars a 
year to build the plants and distribution system necessary for 
significant switching ability to methanol or natural gas the 
report said 
the department and many in the oil industry are worried that 
imports will account for 60 percent of supplies by the middle of 
the next decade that would give the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries leverage it has been unable to exercise in the 
surplussloshed soft markets of recent years because opec will 
then have the only spare production capacity available in the world 
the department promised more detailed reports on the experience 
of other countries supply prospects environmental effects and a 
costbenefit analysis later this year the most recent report was 
described as context and analytical framework 
whatever strategy the country goes with has got to withstand 
cyclical swings in oil prices said scott campbell director of 
the office of policy planning and analysis whose staff did the 
work 
though other approaches should be pursued only methanol 
appears at this stage of the assessment to be a fuel with clear 
potential for meeting a significant percentage of this countrys 
transportation fuel demand in the short run the study said 
the study director vito stagliano estimated that a dualfuel 
car would cost 50 to 350 more in volume production ford motor 
co already has produced several hundred 
to cut oil demand by 1 million barrels a day the report 
estimated these needs 
ten new methanol plants each year for a decade costing a total 
of 20 billion to 25 billion 
development of 10000 to 30000 alternativecapable retail 
outlets a year with an eventual total of 150000 stations costing 
more than 5 billion in all no cost estimate was given for 
changing pipelines barges and other distribution facilities to 
methanol 
methanolcompatible vehicles entering the motor vehicle fleet 
at a rate of 15 million to 8 million a year there are more than 
170 million cars trucks and buses on us highways now 
except in emergencies motorists would not use methanol unless 
it were perceptibly less expensive more than two gallons of 
methanol are needed to provide the mileage obtainable with a gallon 
of gasoline 
nevertheless it is conceivable that the very prospect of 
seeing large volumes of the demand for oil translate into demand 
for alternative fuels will in itself discourage future increases in 
oil prices the report said 
methanol is made most cheaply from natural gas the report 
observed that although the united states is the worlds biggest 
methanol producer it has been a net importer since 1982 and 
middle eastern countries can produce at half the us cost 
a future methanol market could be dominated by opec oil 
suppliers or it might be one in which those countries play a less 
significant role the report said 
middle eastern countries could supply us methanol needs 
economically but any increase in the total potential supply of 
liquid fuels in the world should tend to enhance us energy 
security because it would cause the world energy market to loosen 
up the report said 
a methanol cartel that raised prices would call forth increased 
supplies from elsewhere just as oil output expanded elsewhere in 
the 1970s after opec began steep price hikes the report said 
because feedstocks of natural gas are more widely distributed 
even greater price competition would result in this case it said

california continued to pace the nation last 
year in the receipt of pentagon contracts despite suffering a 
significant drop in awards compared to the previous year new 
reports show 
california also maintained its position as the state with the 
largest defense department payroll as well as the no 1 
destination for military retirees payroll and pension checks 
combined pumped 127 billion into the california economy in fiscal 
1987 the reports show 
nationally the pentagon awarded 14712 billion in contracts 
for work performed inside the united states during fiscal 1987 a 
drop of 21 billion compared to fiscal 1986 
it also paid out 845 billion in payroll and pensions during 
the year to individuals retired or working inside the united 
states up 27 billion compared to the previous year 
of that 845 billion grand total 263 billion went to pay 
civilian employees in the 50 states 34 billion went to pay 
activeduty personnel in the 50 states 55 billion went to pay 
reservists and national guard members and 187 billion went to 
retirees 
the new figures are contained in two annual statistical reports 
one known as the defense department atlas and the other 
entitled prime contract awards by state that attempt to show 
how pentagon spending is affecting the 50 states 
those figures will be augmented in the coming months with 
additional reports on such things as the nations top defense 
contractors total contract actions including work outside the 
united states and civilian and military employee comparisons 
the state statistics for fiscal 1987 show that the 12 months 
ending last sept 30 produced some unusually wide swings in 
pentagon spending patterns 
for example california easily paced the nation with military 
contractors in that state winning 245 billion in awards but that 
total represented an 116 percent drop or 32 billion less than 
the 277 billion in contracts awarded in fiscal 1986 
similarly texas tumbled from second place to fourth in the 
contract rankings because of 209 percent decline in awards while 
virginia climbed from eighth to fifth thanks to a whopping 445 
percent increase in awards 
texas finished the fiscal year with awards totaling 865 
billion while virginia finished with 78 billion second place 
went to new york with 96 billion while third place went to 
massachusetts with 869 billion 
the remainder of the top 10 included missouri at sixth place 
with 6 billion florida with 58 billion connecticut with 5 
billion maryland with 475 billion and ohio with 45 billion 
even setting aside contracting california benefited the most 
from the defense departments presence with 127 billion flowing 
into the state in pension checks and salaries for civilian 
activeduty and reserve employees 
virginia texas florida and georgia rounded out the top five 
retaining the same positions in fiscal 1987 they had the year 
before virginia saw 88 billion flow into its borders in total 
compensation compared to 66 billion for texas 56 billion in 
florida and 32 billion in georgia

a federal watchdog says it is time to use a 
few of the millions of dollars spent annually on antidrug 
education to answer a simple question what works and what doesnt 
that was the conclusion reached by inspector general richard 
kusserow after he was asked by the white house to evaluate a 
variety of programs 
in weeks of studying nancy reagans just say no campaign and 
two other antidrug efforts targeted at the very young 
investigators found more questions than answers 
the main recommendation in a preliminary version of kusserows 
report is that federal agencies should develop an evaluation 
strategy to include long and shortterm evaluations of the 
implementation and effectiveness of youth drug education programs 
specifically he said those strategies should be devised by the 
education department and the alcohol drug abuse and mental health 
administration 
kusserow charged with monitoring programs of the department of 
health and human services agreed to discuss the study after the 
associated press obtained a draft copy 
he acknowledged that the document lacks the precision typically 
associated with ig reports but said that should not be read as an 
indictment of any of the programs surveyed in fact he said it 
looks like theyre on the right track 
but the former fbi agent said his investigators attempts to 
determine whether the programs are just fluff and puffery or 
real were hampered by lack of measurable data 
there is no evidence that seems to be available to tell us how 
successful these programs are he said i think weve put the 
first layer in but if you want to have an ongoing effective 
program were going to get more sophisticated you cannot get 
sophisticated until you start developing some objective criteria 
and some instruments to measure progress 
our concern is that if these programs satisfy themselves that 
they can relax on their laurels and sort of coast on to ever 
increasing success i think theyre deluding themselves if we want 
to increase the effectiveness of the programs we are going to have 
some sort of measurement that would allow them to know what are 
successful techniques versus the less successful techniques 
kusserow added youre not talking about hoards of money to do 
that youre just saying that somewhere along the line theyre 
going to have to set aside some resource to look at how they can go 
about developing a model they can measure 
and developing such measurements he said are beyond the scope 
of the igs office 
in addition to just say no a loosely knit association of 
local efforts operating under a private foundation the ig study 
looked at the boys clubs of americas smart moves and the 
national federation of parents drug free youth 
these programs sort of spontaneously came into being 
kusserow said noting that each is financed almost totally at the 
community level 
he said each of the three should consider developing its own 
criteria for measuring success and that someone perhaps the 
federal alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration 
might want to ask which one is best

phds awarded the physical sciences again were second with 3551 
but educations share of doctorates peaked in 1977 at 7960 and 
has declined steadily since then as fewer men pursued the advanced 
degree men outnumbered women fourtoone among the education 
phds in 1966 women took the lead in 1983 and outnumbered the men

gov richard celeste says he believes the ohio 
primary election this may will determine the presidential nominees 
for both the democrats and the republicans 
celeste said sunday he thinks the state will play the pivotal 
role because the may 3 primary will fall at a key time in the 
nominating process and because of the nature of the state 
i think that the ohio primary will determine who the nominee 
is for each of the parties celeste said in answer to a question 
at a news conference they the winners may not have all the 
delegates but i think it will be clear that they are going to 
be the firstballot choice 
any nominee understands that to win the general election they 
must carry ohio said celeste our state is kind of a fulcrum 
in the political process it seems to me 
celeste said it is too early for him to try to influence the 
nominating process by endorsing a candidate but that he may do so

the california republican party has 
voted to prohibit any endorsement by either the statewide party or 
any official republican county central committee prior to the gop 
primary 
in a threeday convention noteworthy principally for the 
absence of all of the partys presidential candidates who are 
campaigning in states with super tuesday primaries on march 8 
the only other significant business was adoption of new rules for 
naming members to the partys governing board 
the ban on endorsements sunday was in response to a 1986 court 
ruling that a state law prohibiting such endorsements violated 
constitutional free speech guarantees however that ruling left 
the political parties free to adopt any rules they want restricting 
themselves 
contrary to the gop action sunday the california democratic 
party is expected to adopt rules permitting preprimary 
endorsements at its statewide convention next month

managers of a federal nuclear plant in south 
carolina said a recent powerlevel reduction was routine but a 
published report today says the action came after scientists 
discovered that safety equations had been wrong for decades 
the washington post reported that power levels at the savannah 
river weapons material plant reactor were reduced following a 
stormy meeting during which private scientists warned that the 
reactor was operating beyond the demonstrated capacity of its 
emergency cooling system 
managers of savannah river called the 10 percent reduction in 
power the third reduction in 14 months a routine action 
reflecting a change in the way reactor temperatures are measured 
the reduction dropped the operating level from 1100 megawatts 
thermal to 960 megawatts 
power had already been reduced from 2200 megawatts last march 
when a national academy of sciences panel warned that a severe 
accident could overpower the reactors cooling system 
the post quoting sources it did not identify said the latest 
reduction feb 12 was ordered only at the insistence of scientists 
working for ei du pont de nemours amp co does contractor at 
savannah river the scientists had discovered a fundamental error 
in the calculations that have been used for decades to justify 
reactor operating levels the newspaper said 
department of energy officials initially were reluctant to order 
the reduction because they didnt want to admit they had made a 
mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the south 
carolina facility the post reported 
doe confirmed that the power levels at the l reactor one of 
three government reactors at the savannah river facility and the 
last energy department facility that produces plutonium were 
reduced feb 12 the newspaper said 
savannah river manager robert l morgan decided to reduce the 
levels following a confrontation with the scientists at a feb 8 
meeting during which a top du pont scientist threw his security 
badge on the table in front of morgan and threatened to go 
public unless the power levels were lowered the posts sources 
said 
morgan blinked one source told the post 
an unidentified doe official told the newspaper that the 
department did not want to raise the specter of continuing

president reagan says nothing would make him

id like that better than anything else reagan told

everything we can and exploring every avenue to free marine lt

its just so difficult reagan said it is such a terrible 
situation and youre afraid youll do something that will harm them 
the hostages we dont know who they the captors are or where 
they are 
higgins headed a 76man observer group attached to a un 
peacekeeping force in south lebanon there are eight other 
americans as well as 14 other foreigners missing in lebanon

the sister of the longestheld american 
hostage in lebanon says us officials display a double standard by 
working hardest to free the most recent captives 
peggy say who has unflinchingly worked for freedom for her 
brother terry anderson said reagan administration officials 
indicated recently that no progress has been made to win his 
release 
i will not stand by and watch somebody else come out while my 
brother stays behind mrs say said in an interview broadcast 
sunday on cbstvs face the nation 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was abducted march 16 1985 he is among nine americans 
being held hostage in lebanon including recent abductee marine lt 
col william r higgins who was kidnapped wednesday 
mrs say charged that a double standard exists in which us 
officials actively tried to locate higgins but have not been as 
vigorous in trying to find her brother 
she added that the double standard is not new and she cited 
us efforts to free americans held hostage in the hijacking of a 
twa jetliner and the cruise ship achille lauro and the negotiations 
to win the release of journalist nicholas daniloff who was 
arrested by the soviets 
she said that during a state department meeting several months 
ago she was told that their policy was absolute nonnegotiations 
for terry and the others 
i reminded them that they had told me that before twa and i 
watched those negotiations she said and then they got back to 
me and said now were back to our old policy no negotiations i 
watched achille lauro and i watched nick daniloff 
and i said to them a couple of months ago i do not intend to 
stand by again and watch you break that public policy when it is 
politically expedient for you to do so 
president reagan said thursday he wants to rescue higgins 
who headed the 75man observer group attached to the united nations 
interim force in lebanon but officials played down the idea of a 
military mission to gain the officers release

president corazon aquino who has 
weathered coup attempts and other political storms begins her 
third year in office thursday more secure in power than at any time 
during her administration 
but many who saw the feb 2225 1986 uprising against 
president ferdinand marcos as the beginning of a new era in 
philippine politics are disappointed that dreams of social progress 
and reform remain unrealized 
the coalition that propelled mrs aquino to power reformist 
soldiers human rights activists the church and business groups 
has been shattered in the bickering that followed 
two years after marcos downfall land reform remains bogged 
down in congress human rights groups that once castigated marcos 
for the abuses of his administration now raise similar charges 
against the aquino government 
during a radio broadcast sunday mrs aquino described her first 
two years in office as very difficult 
i do not describe it as enjoyment she said but 
definitely it is fulfillment of the highest decree she said 
improving the economic condition of the filipino people would be 
her first priority in the coming year 
last week the major topic of manila newspapers was a debate 
over calls for a limited state of emergency raising dark 
memories of the worst excesses of the marcos era 
it appears that the anniversary will confirm the demise of a 
failed reformist revolution wrote commentator amando doronila in 
the manila chronicle it will show that the revolution two years 
after is like a crushed ant hill with its inhabitants scurrying 
about without direction and in disarray 
despite the disillusionment most western and philippine 
analysts doubt that disgruntled military officers marcos loyalists 
or communist rebels can topple the popular 55yearold widow before 
her term expires on june 30 1992 
military challenges to the aquino administration reached their 
highwater mark in august when mutineers seized media and military 
installations before being driven off about 15 hours later 
the leader of the august attempt lt col gregorio honasan was 
arrested in december ironically he played a major role in the 
feb 22 1986 military mutiny that triggered the popular uprising 
mrs aquino rode to power 
most analysts believe that communist rebels appear to lack both 
the military strength and political following to topple mrs aquino 
within the next four years 
the question used to be will cory make it to 1992 said 
one western analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity now it 
is what will she do in the rest of her term 
beyond surviving the principal achievement of the aquino 
administration has been the restoration of popular democracy 
marked by ratification of a liberal constitution and the elections 
of senators congressmen and regional officials 
last week however senate president jovito salonga noted that 
there were 700 allegations of fraud in the jan 18 regional 
election he said those who believe real democracy has been 
restored are more obsessed with theory than actual fact 
prospects for broad social economic and political reform have 
been clouded by a 28 billion debt a cumbersome legislature and 
political polarization widened by the 19yearold communist 
insurgency and the militarys rising clout 
for much of her term mrs aquino faced serious challenges from 
the military and she owes her political survival in part to a 
faction under defense secretary fidel ramos 
as chief of staff ramos held most of the armed forces behind 
the government and fended off the six coup plots but social 
activists fear her reliance on ramos has lessened the governments 
commitment to reform 
the government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for alleged 
involvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians nor 
has it fulfilled mrs aquinos 1986 campaign promise to abolish the 
civilian home defense force a militarybacked militia widely 
accused of human rights abuses 
and the government has endorsed formation of about 200 
anticommunist vigilante groups which human rights activists and 
church groups have accused of widespread abuses 
she had one thing which could have put aside these 
challenges said mariss diokno a prominent human rights 
activist and that was the people instead of turning to the 
people she turned to the military to bail her out that is the 
tragic element 
friction between the military and civilian branches burst into 
the open last week over proposals for the limited state of 
emergency to deal with communist rebels 
brig gen honesto isleta ramos former spokesman suggested 
such a step to deal with the communists rep eduardo gutang a 
retired general proposed a national security act similar to those 
in malaysia and singapore which allow for detention without charge 
for 60 days 
after criticism from liberal congressmen and the manila press 
ramos said there was no need for a state of emergency but he 
called for tougher laws including a national identity card 
system longer detention for suspected rebels and reimposition of 
the death penalty 
sen rene saguisag a former presidential spokesman and human 
rights lawyer accused the military of blackmail and sen 
teofisto guingona branded the identity card system as the trappings 
of a police state 
in a pageone commentary sunday the proaquino philippine daily 
star said the ouster of marcos had given the country a new lease 
on life a new chance to make dreams into realities 
it added today all those dreams remain for the most part 
still dreams

motorists paid an average halfcent a gallon 
less for gasoline during the past two weeks than during the 
previous two weeks but prices should rise soon an analyst says 
the average retail price of gasoline fell to 9612 cents per 
gallon since the feb 5 survey of prices at 15000 gas stations 
nationwide trilby lundberg said sunday 
as of feb 19 the average for all grades and types of service 
including taxes was 9612 cents compared with 9659 cents on feb 
5 ms lundberg said 
average wholesale prices showed virtually no change meaning a 
loss in the retail operating margin of more than a half cent the 
survey said 
that plus the heavier demand for gasoline in warmer weather 
will add to existing upward pressure on prices ms lundberg said

a rash of railroad accidents last month should 
show congress that serious problems remain in the industry since 
the worst wreck in amtrak history 14 months ago says federal 
railroad administrator john riley 
equally troubling riley said is that the federal government 
has less power to curtail railroad accidents now than it did when 
three conrail locomotives slid through a warning signal and 
collided with an amtrak passenger train near chase md on jan 4 
1987 sixteen people were killed 
its incredible to me that were sitting here 14 months after 
the chase accident and not one shred of legislation introduced in 
the wake of that accident has yet become law riley said during 
an interview he requested to talk about safety concerns as the 
months pass i see the opportunity slipping away from us he said 
riley has been lobbying for measures before housesenate 
conference committees that would permit direct government sanctions 
against railroad workers for safety violations and authorize 
random drug testing 
delays in enacting the sanctions measure is testimony to the 
sheer political power of the labor organizations who oppose it 
riley said the measure would permit the fra to suspend the 
operating privilege of railroad conductors or engineers

aids and lasers top the list of issues as 
thousands of dentists gathered for the 123rd midwinter meeting of 
the chicago dental society 
only a few dentists now use lasers as surgical tools to remove 
lesions and damaged soft tissue from around gums but experts 
predict dentists will soon use lasers to do everything from fitting 
crowns to drilling cavities said harvey wigdor chief of dental 
service at ravenswood hospital medical center 
the fourday conference which started sunday is expected to 
attract 27000 dentists and technicians from 26 countries 
aids poses challenges because of the small chance of dentists 
contracting it from patients and the difficulty of treating 
symptoms of the disease said dr sol silverman chairman of oral 
medicine at the university of california san francisco 
silverman said he will urge dentists to wear gloves to protect 
themselves from contracting aids from patients he said he would 
impress upon them they are legally and morally obligated to treat 
people with aids 
only one dentist is believed to have contracted aids by treating 
patients with the deadly virus without taking the proper 
percautions another dentist has tested positive for antibodies to 
the virus but has not yet shown symptoms of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome silverman said 
the risk of contracting the virus is very very low but why 
take the chance he said 
aids patients develop many symptoms that must be treated by a 
dentist such as mouth lesions ulcers fungus and other lumps and 
bumps he said 
silverman said he will instruct dentists how to treat these 
problems and give them information on how to refer the aids 
patients if the dentist can not handle treatment 
he said he would instruct dentists how to spot early symptoms of 
aids and how to refer them for additional medical assistance 
a french dentist francois duret of marseilles university was 
scheduled to present his new computerized laser systems which may 
revolutionize current procedures for crowns and bridges dental 
society spokesman allen rafalson said 
doctors discussed the future uses of lasers at preconference 
workshops at ravenswood hospital saturday 
lasers offer the advantages of being bloodless very clean and 
causing less posttreatment pain he said 
david harris of the wenske laser center said his laboratory is 
trying to develop a laser drill to get rid of the noise and 
vibration that patients find so adverse when they are having 
cavities drilled 
the high cost of laser equipment 20000 to 25000 prevents 
most individual dentists from purchasing it widgor said 
but widgor and harris who helped organize the workshops said 
prices are expected to drop dramatically in the next few years to 
an affordable level

passengers and crew members on a china 
airlines flight today prevented a taiwanese man from hijacking the 
plane to beijing by hitting him over the head and wrestling him to 
the floor the airline said 
the boeing 737 jetliner was carrying 114 people including one 
american on a flight from taipei to the southern port city of 
kaohsiung 240 miles away when the hijack attempt by the 
29yearold man occurred 
the man an employee at a knife grinding shop was carrying two 
fake grenades made of wood and a slip of paper from a fortuneteller 
predicting a year of bad luck the airline said at a news 
conference 
according to the airline the wouldbe hijacker was subdued 
after a crew member hit him on the head with a hard object 
no injuries were reported among the other 106 passengers and 
seven crew members aboard the jetliner the plane landed at 
kaohsiung and later returned to taipei where members of the cabin 
crew appeared at a press conference 
stewardess lee lin said she was passing out drinks to the 
passengers about 20 minutes after takeoff when the wouldbe 
hijacker chien chuyuan handed her a slip of paper demanding the 
plane be diverted to beijing 
he threatened on the slip of paper that he would kill all of 
us with his two grenades if we didnt fly to beijing she said 
the man later said he wanted to go to taipei but crew members said 
he was nervous and probably meant beijing the wouldbe hijacker 
claimed to have two partners but the airline has ruled out that 
possibility 
the stewardess asked four stewards for help as most passengers 
remained unaware of the unfolding drama the stewards and a few 
passengers then pounced on the hijacker when he tried to show the 
phony grenades to the passengers and subdued him after a 10minute 
scuffle 
we asked the captain to fly in circles and told the hijacker 
we would divert to beijing said steward chi hsian 
police said the wouldbe hijacker a native taiwanese who worked 
in his brothers knife grinding shop was in custody in kaohsuing 
attempted hijacking can carry the death sentence in taiwan 
officials were unsure how many foreigners were aboard the plane 
besides the one american among the passengers was yu chen 
yuehying the kaohsiung county magistrate who is an opposition 
member 
in 1985 an attempted hijacking occurred aboard a china 
airlines boeing 737 flying the same route with 107 passengers in 
that incident a homesick army sergeant who wanted to see his 
parents was overpowered by crew members after he seized a 
stewardess

soviet president andrei gromyko says he rebuffed 
mao tsetungs proposal that the soviet union help lure us troops 
into china where they would be attacked by nuclear weapons a 
newspaper reported today 
gromykos twovolume memoir covers nearly 50 years of soviet 
diplomacy including dealings with nine american presidents 
according to the new york times which said an advance copy was 
made available to its moscow bureau 
in memoir expected to be distributed to bookstores in the 
next few weeks by its soviet publisher gromyko says maos proposal 
came during a secret visit to beijing in august 1958 
gromyko soviet foreign minister from 1957 to 1985 said he was 
surprised by the audacity of the plan according to the times 
the scenario of war described by you cannot meet a positive 
response by us gromyko said he told mao i can say this with 
certainty 
gromyko 78 wrote that mao was anticipating an american attack 
on china because of tensions over the islands of quemoy and matsu 
off mainland china 
mao said chinese forces would retreat to the heartland of china 
luring american soldiers after them then mao proposed the 
soviet union should catch them with all its means gromyko wrote 
at the time china was expecting to receive nuclear weapons from 
the soviet union but moscow withdrew their offer in 1959 soviet 
officials later accused mao of recklessness china exploded its own 
nuclear bomb in 1964 
gromyko denies reports that he misled president kennedy about 
the presence of soviet missiles in cuba during the 1962 missile 
crisis 
in spite of several allegations circulating in the west not 
once in the whole course of the conversation did kennedy raise the 
question of the presence of soviet missiles in cuba he wrote 
consequently i did not have to answer whether or not there 
were such weapons in cuba 
gromyko who dealt with every us president from franklin d 
roosevelt to ronald reagan reserved special praise for roosevelt 
he describes roosevelt as someone who knew how to conduct 
conversation freely without any tension and a leader who knew 
how to make and carry out policy 
he also described meetings with american stars such as marilyn 
monroe whom he met during a hollywood reception for soviet 
officials in 1959 he said they exchanged a few words and he 
recalled her special and indescribable attractiveness

every year the chamber of commerce manages 
to find volunteers to taste more than 100 bottles of homemade wine 
for the newport wine and seafood festival 
its hard work some of the 27 volunteer judges tapped this year 
said over the weekend 
we taste a lot of different wines and try to decide try to be 
objective opal white said we dont want to say anything bad 
about them but some of them she trailed off perhaps not 
wishing to leave a bitter aftertaste 
since wine can be made from nearly anything organic some of the 
entries are well unusual garlic dried kiwi fruit rose petals 
zucchini and even sauerkraut have found their way into bottles 
during past competitions 
a little sauerkraut wine is good on a cold night judge 
joseph swafford said dryly 
stomach aches are unlikely since the rules say the judges are 
supposed to sniff swirl taste and spit still the volunteer 
judges must sign a waiver releasing the chamber from any blame 
should they be struck with a sudden illness and nobody else is 
allowed the taste the amateur wines that are displayed at the 
festival 
the festival which opened friday and runs through feb 28 
allows the public to taste commercial wines and compare their 
choices with results from a panel of professional judges

whales are coming to lake michigan 
the shedd aquarium says its oceanarium a 43 million expansion 
project that should be completed by 1990 will exhibit six whales 
four dolphins several sea otters and a rookery of penguins 
the oceanarium design calls for huge rocks cliffs and 35foot 
trees on 18 acres of what was lake michigan before 30 million 
gallons of water was siphoned so construction could begin below 
lake level in august 
to give the illusion the whales are in the ocean a 
600footlong 35foothigh picture window will overlook the lake 
from behind their tanks 
ive got a gut feeling that we might even have to turn people 
away aquarium director william p braker said recently as cranes 
pounded 75footlong steel pilings for the foundation we had 11 
million visitors in 1987 and with the oceanarium i think we may 
hit 2 million 
three milkwhite 15foot beluga whales will be airlifted from 
churchill manitoba on the hudson bay aquarium officials said as 
whales go manitobas are small but the largest animal now at shedd 
is a 7foot nurse shark 
three more pacific black whales about the size of manitobas 
will be brought from japan the aquarium staff said 
braker said shedd which opened in 1929 and is the worlds 
largest indoor aquarium at 230000 square feet needed a good 
shot in the arm to bring it out of many years of being static 
money for the oceanarium includes 5 million each from the state 
and the chicago park district the aquarium has spent 8 million 
and hopes to raise the remainder of the 25 million price tag 
through donations

family members denied published reports the 
exiled eldest son of the late president gamal abdel nasser will 
return home to face charges that he participated in attacks on 
israeli and american diplomats 
an opposition weekly sawtelarab on sunday quoted the 
fugitive khaled abdel nasser as saying he planned to return from 
exile in yugoslavia to stand trial if convicted he could face the 
death penalty 
the staterun newspaper alakhbar reported today that entry 
points in egypt were placed on alert for the possible return of 
khaled alakhbar also said ahmad elkhawaga a defense attorney 
and head of the egyptian bar association had flown to belgrade 
yugoslavia seeking to bring back khaled 
cairos newspapers said authorities in yugoslavia where khaled 
obtained political asylum were notified through interpol that he 
is a fugitive 
however a member of the nasser family who spoke today with the 
associated press on condition of anonymity said khaled has no 
intention of coming home to face trial another family member 
khaleds brotherinlaw ashraf marawan also reportedly said the 
defendant refuses to come home 
khaled 38 is one of 11 defendants charged in connection with 
four shooting attacks in cairo between 1984 and 1987 that killed 
two israelis and wounded six israelis and two americans 
nine other defendants including gamal shawky abdel nasser a 
nephew of the late president who also is at large are charged with 
lesser crimes in connection with the alleged conspiracy 
in announcing the charges last week government officials said 
all defendants except the nassers were in custody or free on bail 
sources close to the fugitives told the associated press the two 
were advised early in the investigation to leave egypt apparently 
to avoid the embarrassment to the government of having to arrest 
close relatives of a man still adored in much of the arab world 
khaled abdel nassers name has been placed on the list of 
people expected to return to egyptian airports and ports 
alakhbar reported 
it said elkhawaga the attorney hoped to persuade nasser in 
belgrade to turn himself in to egyptian authorities elkhawagas 
office confirmed the attorneys departure but gave no details 
although egypt and yugoslavia have no extradition treaty 
alakhbar speculated that egypt will use diplomatic channels to 
extradite khaled 
the nasserite weekly sawtelarab claimed sunday that khaled 
said in a telephone conversation from belgrade that i have faith 
in the egyptian judiciary system and would return when the trial 
begins 
a trial date has not yet been set

jurors have recommended that a man whose 
death sentence was overturned should be resentenced to die in 
spite of character witness testimony by other death row inmates who 
described him as generous and caring 
james ernest hitchcock 31 was convicted and sentenced to death 
in 1977 for the rapemurder of his 13yearold stepniece the us

circuit judge gary formet sr is not required to follow the 
jurys recommendation in his decision which will be announced

arrest in july 1976 he later recanted and blamed the killing on 
his older brother richard who james said had become enraged when 
he caught the defendant and victim having sex 
hitchcock testified saturday he confessed to the slaying because 
i thought i was doing the right thing for my brother i loved 
him i covered it up 
richard hitchcock 38 denied the accusation last week as he did 
11 years ago when cynthia driggers died he was not charged in his 
stepdaughters death

peacemaker teacher and generous person who should be spared from

fights and loaned them money for tennis shoes and cigarettes

the 61 arabs killed by israelis in antioccupation violence and 
israels attorney general ruled soldiers could not use force to 
punish or humiliate protesters

wounded in the thigh in the gaza strip 
the army reported an arab was arrested after trying to attack an 
israeli soldier with a knife in the west bank town of ramallah it 
was the third such attack on soldiers in four days 
leaflets distributed by underground palestinian groups in the 
occupied territories called for demonstrations this week 
beginning with memorial services on martyrs day today to 
protest the visit to israel by secretary of state george p shultz 
army officials said the fiveday visit scheduled to start 
thursday might prompt an escalation in violence in the west bank 
and gaza strip its not organized or systematic but outside 
events like the shultz visit do affect the situation an army 
spokeswoman said she spoke on condition of anonymity 
attorney general yosef harish sent a letter to defense minister 
yitzhak rabin saying soldiers may not use force as a means of 
punishment or humiliation israel radio reported 
orders that call for such use of force are illegal ruled 
harish who demanded rabin issue appropriate instructions to the 
troops harish said many palestinians have complained to him about 
abuse by soldiers 
in an army survey 65 percent of soldiers questioned said they 
had witnessed rough treatment of palestinians by troops said the 
armys chief psychologist col shlomo dover the radio did not say 
how many soldiers were questioned 
dover said 70 percent felt angry and frustrated by the situation 
in the occupied lands and said they thought using the army to break 
up civilian protests damages its effectiveness to fight a war 
dover told israel radio that 92 percent of the soldiers 
questioned expressed full trust in their commanders 
we dont have problems with the motivation of soliders not 
that they rejoice to do it but its an assignment that has been 
given to the army and thats how it is seen by the soldiers he 
said 
since the wave of protests began dec 8 in the territories 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war israelis have killed 61 
palestinians the latest fatalities were two men shot and killed by 
soldiers sunday

palestinian government yes to the plo 
the palestine liberation organization has ordered palestinians 
in the west bank and gaza strip not to meet with shultz saying he

to persuade plo chief yasser arafat to lift the ban us officials 
met with several palestinian representatives over the weekend to 
discuss the shultz visit 
during his visit shultz will present to israeli leaders a us 
peace initiative calling for an international forum for direct 
talks on palestinian selfrule and negotiations on a final 
settlement by december 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir told european jewish leaders 
sunday night he objected to the hurried pace any attempt to 
force the pace and shorten the period of selfrule would be a 
detriment to the very essence of the agreement 
he also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept the 
american plan when the time comes for decisions we shall decide 
on the basis of what is in our national interests

now that the new york post has been saved 
readers and employees wonder what the nations oldest continuously 
published newspaper will look like under the new owner and whether 
hell stop its moneylosing ways 
peter kalikow who is buying the tabloid from rupert murdoch for 
376 million spent sunday talking with advisers about what 
direction to take the post 
the papers 10 unions agreed saturday to 22 million in 
concessions that murdoch and kalikow said were necessary to keep 
the paper alive that includes eliminating 130 of the posts 1200 
jobs 
kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the papers 
emphasis on stories of sex crime and scandal 
it will remain a tabloid but there will be a change in 
format said his spokesman howard rubenstein therell be 
changes in headlines in the front page in the emphasis of the 
paper 
but rubenstein added kalikow still wants it to be feisty and 
provocative 
murdoch bought the paper in 1976 and fashioned it after the 
british tabloids soon readers were seeing such headlines as 
headless body in topless bar which ran above a story about a 
homicide in a tavern 
they saw a photo of prince rainier of monaco looking into and 
making an obscene hand gesture at a post photographers lens the 
caption read the prince gives us the finger 
and then there was the story about libyan leader moammar 
gadhafis reported psychological problems featuring a photograph 
doctored to show readers what he would look like dressed as a 
woman complete with lipstick and earrings 
kalikow a real estate developer and businessman worth an 
estimated 500 million has approved a 2 million promotional 
campaign for the newspaper said rubenstein 
according to his agreement with murdoch kalikow promised to 
keep the post in operation for at least one year after he takes 
over march 7 
the post lost about 17 million before taxes last year and 
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months its 
circulation has dropped from 700000 to 500000 partly because of 
a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan new york 
a 1 million marketing study commissioned by kalikow shows the 
paper already appeals to a fairly welltodo audience rubenstein 
said

a proiranian extremist group today 
released a videotaped message from a kidnapped us marine colonel 
calling on president reagan to meet his captors demands 
the 70second tape from the organization of the oppressed on 
earth was accompanied by a typewritten arabic statement reiterating 
the groups claim that the hostage lt col william r higgins is 
a cia agent 
the arabic statement also warned lebanons mainstream shiite 
moslem militia amal to stop searching for higgins 43 of 
danville ky who was abducted wednesday near the southern port 
city of tyre 
amal which continued its search today has taken into custody 
dozens of members of hezbollah lebanons most radical shiite 
group hezbollah which is believed to be the umbrella organization 
for proiranian groups holding most of the 24 foreign hostages in 
lebanon on sunday declared support for higgins captors 
hezbollah and amal militimen clashed in a brief firefight 
sunday no casualties were reported in the halfhour shootout in 
the southeastern village of ein eltineh 
in the videotape delivered today to a western news agency in 
beirut an unshaven higgins appears to be reading from a statement 
the statement by higgins says reagan has to take responsibility 
for the crimes he has committed against the oppressed people in the 
region 
in the statement higgins then lists the same demands his 
captors made when they first claimed his abduction friday in a 
statement that called the colonel a cia spy us and un 
officials denied the spying charge 
the demands as given by higgins are 
israels withdrawal from the selfproclaimed security zone it 
carved out in southern lebanon when the bulk of its army withdrew 
from lebanon in 1985 ending a threeyear invasion 
the release of all detained lebanese and palestinian 
mujahedeen or holy warriors from the khiam detention camp in 
the security zone and in israeli jails an estimated 300 detainees 
are believed held at khiam 
an end to what they call us intervention in lebanon and to 
us diplomatic missions to the middle east 
secretary of state george p shultz is to travel to the region 
this week to present a peace plan aimed at ending 10 weeks of 
rioting by palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the statement accompanying the videotape calls on justice 
minister nabih berris amal militia to call off its search for 
higgins in southern lebanon 
we call on our brethren in amal to understand the dangerous 
espionage role higgins was carrying out profiting from the un 
observer role the statement says in an earlier statement given 
to a beirut newspaper the group said it was lying in wait for 
any other suspicious american 
a decorated vietnam veteran and onetime assistant to former 
defense secretary caspar weinberger higgins heads a 76man 
observer group attached to a un peacekeeping force in south 
lebanon 
his abduction has stirred tension between amal and hezbollah 
which has been challenging amals dominance in southern lebanon 
amal has rejected the kidnappers charge that higgins is a spy 
saying in a statement that most abductions by extremist shiite 
factions in lebanon were motivated by a desire to extract ransoms 
in washington reagan on sunday night said were doing 
everything we can and exploring every avenue to free higgins 
higgins abduction prompted the uns interim forces in 
lebanon or unifil to withdraw 20 observers to its headquarters in 
naqoura near the israellebanon border said timor goksel 
spokesman for unifil 
the rest of the observer group which is required to be unarmed 
remained sunday in positions overlooking beiruts green line which 
divides the city into moslem and christian sectors he said 
the palestine liberation organization meanwhile declared it was 
working for higgins release 
in an interview today in tunisia plo leader yasser arafat said 
he had given instructions to his colleagues in lebanon to contact 
the kidnappers 
in general i can say it was one of the fanatic lebanese 
groups that was responsible for the abduction he said on 
cbstvs this morning 
higgins was the third un official abducted in south lebanon in 
three weeks jan stening 44 of sweden and willian jorgensen 58 
of norway both employees of the un relief and works agency that 
cares for palestinian refugees were kidnapped feb 5 about 25

at least a fifth of the nations parents 
would refuse to send their children to school if a classmate 
contracted aids according to a survey by louis harris and 
associates 
the poll conducted for children magazine also found more than 
half of the parents would want to know the identity of young aids 
victims in their community and all but 6 percent believe schools 
should educate youngsters about the deadly disease 
the pollsters surveyed 411 parents with children 3 to 18 years 
old between oct 23 and oct 25 the survey has a margin of error 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
according to the poll 21 percent of parents would keep their 
children home if a classmate contracted acquired immune defeciency 
syndrome 66 percent would allow their youngsters to continue 
attending classes and 12 percent were uncertain or would need to 
weigh the circumstances to decide 
experts with the federal centers for disease control insist aids 
is not transmitted through casual contact but through sex 
contaminated blood products and tainted hypodermic needles and 
infected pregnant women can give it to their fetus 
but a few cases including a child in pennsylvanias rural 
monroe county have no easily explained source for the virus which 
destroys the bodys ability to fight infection 
scientifically you could not make the statement that it would 
be impossible to contact aids from casual contact with a 
classmate said lester lave a professor of economics at 
carnegiemellon university in pittsburgh and past president of the 
society of risk analysis 
but it seems extremely unlikely we lose kids every year in 
school bus accidents we havent lost any kids from a casual 
contact with aids he said 
the survey also found that 56 percent would want to know the 
identity of aids victims enrolled in school while 39 percent 
believe the information should remain confidential as required by 
federal law 
parents believe the special nature of the disease requires 
extraordinary steps on the part of school districts 
according to the survey 94 percent of the parents say schools 
need to educate teachers and students about the disease even if no 
one in the district has contracted aids 
i think thats a virtual mandate for schools to get 
information out for teachers and students to understand said 
michael r kagay vice president of the harris organization 
currently 17 states require aids education in public schools 
the figures from various parts of the country differ 
in the west 74 percent of the parents would allow their 
children to attend school with an aids victim in the midwest the 
figure is 70 percent and in the east the percentage drops to 60 
percent 
kagay believes the concentration of the disease in large cities 
particularly on the east coast accounts for the difference 
what you are seeing here is the nearness of the threat 
kagay said so the stronger the threat or the closer to home the 
more reluctant parents may be to send their kids to school 
official estimates of the number of children with aids vary from 
300 to 500 according to the magazine but dr james oleske of 
childrens hospital in new jersey in newark believes up to 3000 
children now carry the virus and half suffer from the disease

official corruption linked to the drug trade 
is spreading around latin america giving an anxious edge to 
longstanding predictions the illegal traffic could damage the 
regions political stability 
because the people who produce and deal in cocaine marijuana 
and heroin are so wealthy the law enforcement agencies entrusted 
with the fight against them are often outmatched 
indeed bolivian president victor paz estenssoro estimates 
cocaine brings in 600 million each year to his nation compared to 
500 million for all legal exports combined 
in that impoverished south american country alone about 400000 
farmers merchants and others depend directly or indirectly on coca 
leaf farming and cocaine for their livelihood 
allegations that the drug trade is providing funds for 
candidates has become an issue in this years election in 
venezuela an outburst of drugrelated violence in colombia has led 
to calls for the government to be given special powers to combat it 
bolivia colombia and mexico have for some time been known as 
notorious centers of drug production and trafficking 
but in recent months cases and allegations of officials playing 
an integral role in the drug trade have emerged in once overlooked 
countries honduras haiti and panama 
and after a period of relative calm drug cases proceeding in 
the us judicial system are once again having a major impact on 
relations between washington and many latin american nations 
unfortunately much the united states does these days becomes 
buried in ideological rhetoric which has nothing whatever to do 
with the issue at hand said a recent editorial in the daily 
nation the largest newspaper in the caribbean island nation of 
barbados 
traditionally the response from governments and observers in 
the region is to call for the united states to look more closely at 
how to control american drug consumers whose dollars provide the 
basic incentive for the trade 
in a recent editorial the mexican government news agency 
notimex said the money floated in the drug trade approximates the 
total amount of debt service payments made by latin american 
countries each year something in the neighborhood of 47 billion 
that figure shows the economic magnitude that the networks of 
narcotics trafficking have and the use of planes ships weapons 
and a great deal of money to bribe officials and judicial 
authorities the editorial said however the principal problem 
is the enormous consumption of drugs that exists in the united 
states and that reaches 110 billion 
gen manuel antonio noriega chief of the defense forces of 
panama and the power behind his countrys nominally civilian 
government was named in two florida indictments feb 5 for 
racketeering and other drugrelated charges 
allegations of his involvement in a wide range of illicit 
activities including drug trafficking and money laundering have 
played a role in protests against his rule that began in june 
in retaliation for the steady attacks from washington noriegas 
supporters have called for the ouster of the southern command 
headquarters for all us military activities in latin america 
the pentagon meanwhile has described as isolated cases the 
recent discovery of two cocaine shipments aboard us military 
aircraft based in panama saying they did not appear linked to 
official corruption in that country 
in honduras a key us ally in central america the government 
and armed forces have responded with indignation to newspaper 
accounts alleging links between the military and drug traffickers 
i am free of any guilt gen humberto regalado hernandez 
chief of the honduran armed forces said in a telephone interview 
i will not deceive my own people 
haitian col jeanclaude paul who runs an army unit known as 
his countrys most brutal was named by a miami businessman as 
haitis main cocaine trafficker the businessman osvaldo quintana 
told reporters he also knew of involvement by higher haitian 
officials 
testimony at the trial of reputed colombian drug kingpin carlos 
lehder rivas in jacksonville fla has implicated prime minister 
lynden o pindling of the bahamas 
nine mexicans were indicted in january in los angeles in the 
1985 kidnapmurder of american drug agent enrique camarena salazar 
while a san diego case a week later named seven mexicans among 12 
foreign nationals said to be behind a major cocaine ring 
we insist that it will not be possible to defeat international 
drug trafficking unless production distribution and consumption 
are attacked with similar strength and effectiveness president 
miguel de la madrid said at his feb 13 meeting with president 
reagan this final link consumption in the united states 
continues to have a determining influence in the criminal chain 
it looks like us officials are taking the problem 
seriously but theyre not bayardo ramirez monagas president of 
venezuelas national commission on drug abuse said in an 
interview the problem is not production or consumption but the 
financing

he didnt win the 60 scores that signal 
an absolutely flawless program but to figure skater brian boitano 
his gold medalwinning performance at the olympics was the ultimate 
10 
this time it was perfect the 24yearold californian said 
one day after he defeated friend and rival brian orser of canada to 
become the only us olympic gold medalist the united states only 
other medals have been a bronze in the figure skating pairs and a 
silver in 1500 meter speed skating 
for the first time in my life it looked better than it felt 
boitano told a news conference sunday after watching a video of 
his triumphant performance im usually so critical of myself 
that i thought id see things id done wrong 
instead it was the first time i could say the jumps were 
the best ive done and i could say hey what a good program 
its something you build for for years and when it happens its 
the ultimate 
saturday nights dramatic battle of the brians capped 10 
years of skating rivalry that saw boitano lose the last two 
meetings at skate canada last fall and at the 1987 world 
championships each man selected his own military music and battle 
colors blue for boitano red for orser 
boitano from the solemn opening notes from carmine coppolas 
napoleon to the final seconds when he thrust his fist in the 
air and wiped away a tear of elation shone throughout 
the fourtime american titlist was first with five of the nine 
judges to orsers four although they tied in points the judges 
gave boitano the victory on better technical marks 
writing about his future for usa today newspaper boitano said 
its kind of scary because you know your life is going to change 
and you dont know if youre ready for it or if you want it to 
change 
money from commercial endorsements or other appearances was 
not the reason behind his drive to win the gold he wrote for 
todays edition im sure ill do some things with it but its 
not why i treasure it 
its going to be different when i go home its kind of scary 
thinking about what its going to be like when i get back to san 
francisco wondering if ill be able to slip in and out everywhere 
without being recognized i worry about privacy about always being 
on show brain boitano seen drinking a wine he said

apartment building in rio where three days of mudslides and flash 
floods have killed at least 80 people

made the city look like a giant stepped through the area 
officials said the flooding the worst in the citys history 
had rendered homeless at least 11000 of rios 56 million 
residents washing ramshackle homes down steep slopes and turning 
streets into raging torrents 
throughout the city army trucks and volunteers helped transport 
evacuated dwellers of precarious hillside shantytowns to temporary 
shelters in schools churches and public buildings

three commercial tv networks donated truckloads of medicine food 
clothing and building supplies to the victims

to boil drinking water and said the government would vaccinate for 
typhoid and tetanus 
the building that collapsed in abolicao was in a 
lowermiddleclass area but most victims of the storms were poor 
people who had lived in shacks built on the citys steep 
mountainsides 
water mud and boulders washed many such shacks down the steep 
slopes and turned streets below into raging torrents and even 
lagoons 
i cant even imagine what will happen to this city if the 
rains continue said vice mayor jo rezende the situation is 
desperate we estimate 50000 people will have to be given new 
housing in safer areas 
at the collapsed building in abolicao rescue workers trudged 
through kneedeep mud and rubble searching for victims at least 13 
people were rescued

a baby born with nearly no brain was 
on lifesupport equipment today as a potential organ donor after a 
similar infant was taken off life support machinery officials said 
both newborns born with the birth defect known as anencephaly 
or severely underdeveloped brains were part of a controversial 
program at loma linda university medical center preserving 
braindead anencephalic infants for use as organ donors 
the practice has drawn fire from righttolife groups charging 
cruelty and from medical ethicists who say it is questionable to 
keep the babies on life support when they have no chance at 
longterm survival 
evelyn keys born saturday in san antonio texas was flown to 
loma linda that night to be used in the donor program 
she arrived just hours after a child identified only as baby 
john was taken off life support when a worldwide search failed to 
turn up any needy organ recipients matching his tissue type said 
hospital spokeswoman anita rockwell 
but one of the infants heart valves was removed and stored for 
later use ms rockwell said 
anencephalic babies usually die shortly after birth and loma 
linda where infant heart transplants have become routine wants to 
establish a practice of sustaining such babies so their organs can 
be transplanted after brain death is certified by two independent 
physicians 
hospital officials said removal of baby johns heart valve was 
the first use of body parts from a us anencephalic infant loma 
linda previously transplanted the heart from an anencephalic baby 
declared braindead in canada 
baby evelyn was born to judy keys 22 and airman todd keys 21 
of the 6993rd electronic security squad at lackland air force base 
doctors report baby evelyn is resting comfortably and 
although there are some signs of brain stem deterioration she has 
not yet met all the criteria of brain death ms rockwell said 
today 
loma linda is the first hospital in the united states to develop 
a medical program allowing the practice of sustaining anencephalic 
infants for transplants 
if brain death does not occur within a week of birth an 
anencephalic baby will be removed from its respirator and allowed 
to die naturally 
several thousand anencephalic babies are born in the united 
states each year their brain stems can sustain basic functions 
such as breathing for a short time but death usually occurs within 
hours or days of birth 
loma linda has specialized in infant heart transplants with 13 
babies under the age of four months given new hearts at the 
hospital nine have survived 
the center 65 miles east of los angeles became well known in 
1984 when dr leonard bailey unsuccessfully transplanted the heart 
of a baboon into an infant known as baby fae

six european relief workers who were 
abducted by rebels in ethiopia have been released a medical aid 
official said today 
three irishwomen two belgians and a dutchman were set free 
after being kidnapped by the popular front for the liberation of 
the tigre last thursday said an official of the medical relief 
group medicins sans frontieresbelgium 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said no 
details were available and did not specify when the relief workers 
were freed 
earlier today seyoum musse head of foreign relations for the 
london office of the rebel group said the six were in good 
condition 
the whole aim of taking them with us was to show there are 
millions of people who are beyond the reach of isolated 
symbolic government food distribution centers like the one they 
were stationed at musse said in a telephone interview 
the aim is to dispel the governments misinformation that 
millions are being reached with aid he said denying that the 
groups action was an abduction 
the government will not allow these workers to go outside the 
place they work for this reason we have taken them a few hours 
away he said they are the guests of millions of starved 
people 
the rebels abducted two belgian doctors and a dutch nurse of the 
international aid group along with two irish nuns and an irish 
doctor from their base in idaga hamous in tigre about 340 miles

workers may have been abducted to treat rebel wounded fighting in

a us warship making its maiden voyage 
on the persian gulf fired warning shots today at a pair of fishing 
boats that crew members initially believed were attack vessels 
a us military official asking not to be identified said the 
landingdock ship trenton took the action after it observed two 
apparent boghammartype boats coming toward it about 30 miles 
off the coast of dubai 
he said the trenton issued two verbal warnings which were 
ignored and as the boats approached to within 3300 yards it 
fired a flare and bursts of 50caliber machinegun fire at which 
time the craft stopped then veered off toward the northeast 
a helicopter sent up from the frigate john a moore later 
confirmed through observation that both were fishing boats and 
neither was hit or damaged the official added 
he said the boats at first appeared to resemble the fast 
swedishbuilt boghammar marin boats frequently used by irans 
revolutionary guards to attack commercial ships in the gulf 
us warships in the past have fired warning shots to keep 
unidentified small boats and iraqi aircraft from approaching too 
close to convoys escorted by the navy 
the 17000ton trenton had just arrived in the gulf hours 
earlier carrying about 400 us marines and a contingent of marine 
attack helicopters 
it was accompanied by the missile frigate john a moore and the 
gus w darnell a 39000ton oiler chartered by the us military 
sealift command the darnell makes periodic trips into the gulf to 
pick up fuel oil for us warships 
us officials said that because the group included no kuwaiti 
tankers or other commercial vessels under the us flag it would 
not be counted as a gulf transit the navy has conducted 35 
escorted convoys since last july and the next one is expected to 
leave kuwait in the next few days 
meanwhile the us gulf operation will get a new commander this 
week a 50yearold career aviator who once headed the blue angels 
the navys elite acrobatic jet team 
rear adm anthony a less will become commanding officer of the 
navys middle east force in ceremonies saturday aboard a new 
flagship uss coronado the salem ohio native replaces rear adm 
harold j bernsen 
as commander of the force since july 1986 bernsen oversaw last 
years buildup that followed president reagans decision to 
reregister 11 kuwaiti oil tankers under the american flag to 
protect them from attacks by iran 
under bernsen the force nearly tripled in size from about six 
to 17 warships it was recently cut back to 16 
the united states has been escorting kuwaiti vessels since last 
summer the only mishap occurred during the first convoy when the 
supertanker bridgeton struck a mine believed laid by iran on july 
24 since then the navy has escorted 34 other convoys without a 
hitch 
iranian ships frequently stop and search vessels they suspect of 
carrying cargo for iraq iran also attacks neutral ships in 
retaliation for iraqi air raids on irans oil shipping in the gulf 
the two nations have been at war for 7 years 
the last such raid claimed by iraq was last tuesday and no ship 
attacks by iran have been reported since feb 11 
less takes over a command being drastically reshaped for the 
second time in the past several months 
on feb 3 he relieved rear adm dennis brooks as commander of 
the joint task force middle east a shipboard headquarters created 
last year to improve coordination between the gulfbased ships and 
two supporting battle groups in the arabian sea 
wellinformed navy officers speaking on condition of anonymity 
say the system failed because of operational conflicts between the 
gulf and task force commanders 
although the middle east force is a surface unit us law 
requires any ship with extensive air capability such as the 
16912ton coronado and the 15000ton la salle which it replaces 
to be commanded by an aviator 
less flew a7 corsair attack bombers from the carrier kitty hawk 
during the vietnam war and in 1973 became the first commanding 
officer of the blue angels when the flight demonstration team was 
formally made a squadron he served as its commander and flight 
leader for three years 
less later commanded the oil tanker wichita and the attack 
carrier ranger operating in the western pacific and the indian 
ocean with the us seventh fleet since last august he had 
commanded a carrier group and battle group 
bernsen a boston native and specialist in aerial electronic 
surveillance served five tours aboard the carrier forrestal in the 
mediterranean he was commanding officer of the la salle later 
his own flagship during the 1979 us hostage crisis in iran and 
the start of the iraqiran war in 1980

nursery school and a morgue early today in paris causing extensive 
damage but no injuries firefighters reported 
a previously unknown group called committee of international 
revolutionary solidarity claimed responsibility for the morgue

day that a trial of seven alleged french terrorists began 
police said the explosion at the morgue called medicallegal 
institute occurred at about 530 am a guardian and his family 
who live at the institute were awakened by the blast but not hurt 
about half an hour later and a mile to the northeast a second

bastille 
no one was at the school 
fires at both locations were rapidly brought under control by 
firefighters

the second explosion and no indication why the nursery school or 
the morgue might have been chosen as targets

are not sympathizers of direct action we are against the state as 
arms dealer and a society that profits from death

france was effectively dismantled by a series of arrests last year

afternoon with seven people charged in the 1983 robberies of a

this week to protest the visit to israel by us secretary of state 
george shultz 
army officials said the fiveday shultz visit scheduled to

its not organized or systematic but outside events like the 
shultz visit do affect the situation an army spokeswoman said on 
condition of anonymity 
jerusalem police spokesman rafi levy said 1500 additional 
officers brought in from other areas had been deployed in the holy 
city to curb arab violence 
israeli troops entered the arab neighborhood of silwan at the 
foot of the mount of olives and cleared away makeshit barricades

and looking for agitators 
attorney general yosef harish sent a letter to defense minister 
yitzhak rabin saying soldiers may not use force as a means of 
punishment or humiliation said justice ministry spokeswoman etty 
eshed 
orders that call for such use of force are illegal ruled 
harish who demanded rabin issue appropriate instructions to the 
troops 
ms eshed said harish decided to take action after many 
palestinians complained to him about abuse by soldiers 
in an army survey 65 percent of soldiers questioned said they 
had witnessed rough treatment of palestinians by troops said the 
armys chief psychologist col shlomo dover on israel radio 
we dont have problems with the motivation of soliders not 
that they rejoice to do it but its an assignment that has been 
given to the army and thats how it is seen by the soldiers he 
said 
since the wave of protests began dec 8 in the territories 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war israelis have killed 61 
palestinians the latest fatalities were two men shot and killed by 
soldiers sunday

the supreme court today agreed to study a key 
affirmative action issue the power of local governments to 
require minority participation in public works projects 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by richmond va 
officials seeking to revive a socalled setaside program for 
construction industry businesses owned by minorities 
the court previously expressed interest in examining the issue 
when on jan 19 it asked the justice department to comment on a 
construction companys challenge to a setaside program in the 
miami area 
but the justices stopped short of announcing whether they will 
hear arguments in the miami dispute 
in the richmond case the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled last september that the citys preferential treatment for 
minority businesses approved in 1983 is an unconstitutional form of 
reverse discrimination 
the richmond plan would require the prime contractor on any city 
building contract to subcontract at least 30 percent of the value 
of the project to firms that are at least onehalf minority owned 
the minorities covered by the plan were blacks hispanics 
orientals indians eskimos and aleuts 
the appeals court in its 21 decision relied heavily on a 1986 
supreme court ruling that struck down an affirmative action plan in 
michigan designed to protect from layoffs minority teachers with 
less seniority than whites 
the supreme court in that case said preferential treatment of 
minorities must be narrowly tailored to avoid hurting whites the 
court restricted the power of employers to adopt affirmative action 
programs when there has not been proof those employers practiced 
past discrimination 
supporters of local setaside programs on the other hand point 
to a 1980 supreme court ruling that congress may require 10 percent 
of federal public works contracts be earmarked for 
minoritycontrolled businesses 
an eventual supreme court ruling on local setaside programs 
would have farreaching impact 
most states and some 160 local governments have such programs 
according to a study by the minority business enterprise legal 
defense education fund 
the 4th circuit court in striking down the richmond plan said 
the citys program was adopted on scant evidence of past 
discrimination 
the appeals court noted that minorities comprise about half of 
richmonds population and that minorityowned businesses had 
received less than 1 percent of the value of the citys public 
building contracts 
but the appeals court said there are few minorityowned 
businesses in the city area and there was no evidence they had 
been victims of past discrimination 
general population statistics suggest if anything more of a 
political than a remedial basis for the racial preference quota 
in the setaside program the 4th circuit court said there has 
been no showing that qualified minority contractors who submitted 
low bids were passed over 
the appeals court also said the 30 percent quota was chosen 
arbitrarily the figure simply emerged from the mists 
the richmond ordinance reflects the most casual deployment of 
race in the dispensation of public benefits it prefers some and 
in so doing diminishes the rights of all the appeals court said 
a coalition of groups representing local and state governments 
urged the supreme court to reinstate the richmond plan 
the coalition said it would reopen old wounds and discourage 
affirmative action if governments must first show past 
discrimination before adopting remedial programs 
the coalition groups are the national league of cities the us 
conference of mayors the national association of counties and the 
international city management association 
richmonds plan was challenged by the ja croson co after its 
bid the only one submitted to install stainless steel urinals 
and water closets at the city jail was rejected 
city officials refused to award the contract after croson said 
there was only one unqualified minority contractor that could help 
on the project the company said the cost of the project would rise 
by 7663 if the minority contractor were used the city then 
called for new bids 
the case is richmond vs croson 87998

sara and amy kienast glare at each other 
over feet propped on the dining room table and argue the finer 
points of rock n roll music they both like it but amy wouldnt

alike yet so different 
sara amy abby ted and gordon turn 18 on wednesday and hope

of separate lives 
weve been five all our lives now is our chance to be one 
said sara as her brothers and sisters nod in agreement we want

bunch and proud of it 
they also are distinctly individual each plans to attend a 
different college and four have picked schools far from the 
spacious farmhouse in this new york city suburb where they grew up 
its about time abby said with a grin ive been with 
them for 18 years i could make do without seeing their faces every 
day 
none plans to tell new friends he or she is a quintuplet 
why should we have someone look at us and think of four 
different people said sara 
the quints say their separation in the fall will be painless 
because they all live separate lives now 
we basically have the same friends but we dont hang out with 
the same people said amy on the weekends we dont do things 
together 
the siblings say that all that sets them apart from other 
teenagers is that there are five of them 
we have the same fights you know that other brothers and 
sisters have the girls are always taking my sweaters and stuff 
ted said to the protests of his sisters 
the quints gained worldwide attention when they were born feb 
24 1970 after their mother peggy jo kienast took fertility 
drugs 
at first many offers of help and endorsement opportunities 
clothed and fed the children but financial pressures began a few 
years later and an anonymous source saved them from eviction by 
providing more than 115000 to pay off mortgages and property 
taxes the kienasts owed 
in 1984 the quints father william committed suicide after 
his plastics business began to falter 
at that most difficult time reporters and photographers camped 
outside the familys home making the family angry 
i really started to resent the media when dad died said 
sara theres a limit you can take 
i understand now said ted they have a job to do and 
someone sends them out to get a picture and they have paychecks and 
families too but at the time it was too much 
despite the unwanted attention the quintuplets say they 
appreciated the cards and letters they received from around the 
world when their father died 
they also say they have put his death behind them 
we couldnt dwell on it amy said mom wanted us to get on 
with our lives 
mrs kienast says shes looking forward to her children leaving 
home 
im all for parenting and children but i dont live through 
my children im looking forward to this next step she said 
youre worn out by their senior year 
the quints birthdays what ted calls press day have 
always been met by clicking cameras and a string of interviews but 
this year will be different the quints plan to go their separate 
ways and celebrate with friends on wednesday then hold a private 
family party on sunday

the supreme court today refused to let a texas 
hospital withhold the names of its blood donors from a woman who 
says her baby daughter contracted aids after receiving transfusions 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the donors 
privacy rights do not override belinda jacksons need to find out 
their identities in her wrongfuldeath lawsuit against the hospital 
ms jackson sued the tarrant county hospital district in 1986 
alleging that her daughter tristainne died of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome after receiving blood transfusions in 1983 at 
john peter smith hospital in fort worth 
in pretrial discovery proceedings ms jackson sought to find 
out the identities and addresses of all blood donors whose blood 
had been used in the treatment of her prematurely born daughter 
hospital district officials asked for permisssion to withhold 
the information contending that releasing it would violate the 
donors privacy rights and threaten the future availability of a 
volunteer blood supply program 
judge william l hughes jr who is presiding over the state 
court case ruled for ms jackson in late 1986 but later blocked 
any disclosure of the blood donors identities so the hospital 
district could appeal 
a state appeals court also ruled for ms jackson and the texas 
supreme court refused to hear the hospital districts appeal last 
oct 7 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the hospital district 
said it is unclear whether restrictions imposed by the state judge 
would block ms jackson from asking friends coworkers and others 
about intimate and discreet details about the donors personal 
lives 
the parameters of the constitutional right of privacy of blood 
donors should be considered and defined by this court the 
hospital district lawyers said a viable national supply of blood 
and blood products is at stake 
the case is tarrant county hospital district vs hughes 871082

an army colonel accused in the 1986 
slaying of a leftist leader surrendered to the military today 
military sources said 
lt col eduardo red kapunan was placed under house arrest 
at his residence in suburban quezon citys camp aquinaldo home of 
the philippine armed forces the sources said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
last week chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered the 
arrest of kapunan and three other members of a military group known 
as reform the armed forces movement in connection with the nov 13 
1986 slaying of leftist leader rolando olalia and his chauffeur 
two of the four remained at large and the other member navy 
capt rex robles also is under house arrest at camp aguinaldo 
a letter purportedly written by kapunan and given to filipino 
reporters denied he was involved in the slaying of olalia 
i am innocent of these charges being leveled against me and i 
believe this is all part of a grand scheme to discredit all of us 
who were involved in the february revolution which installed mrs 
corazon aquino as president it said 
kapunan said because he has been implicated in the olalia case 
he has become an enemy of the kilusang mayo uno or may first 
movement a leftist labor movement that blames the military for 
olalias death 
meanwhile robles left his house monday and started to walk with 
his wife to a post chapel for a mass for members of his movement 
but military police made him return home his wife said 
the mass marked the second anniversary of the day when then 
defense minister juan ponce enrile and thenlt gen fidel ramos 
broke with president ferdinand e marcos as part of the people 
power revolution in february 1986 that led to the downfall of 
marcos and the rise of aquino 
last week members of the military reform movement claimed 
ramos now defense secretary had failed to check corruption during 
his tenure as military chief of staff and had used his position to 
increase his personal wealth 
ramos has dismissed the allegations made in a letter by the 
reform the armed forces movement

the supreme court today agreed to decide when 
police need court warrants before searching from helicopters for 
marijuana growing in fencedin yards 
the justices said they will study a florida supreme court ruling 
that a helicopter search by sheriffs deputies in pasco county four 
years ago violated the right of privacy 
the nations highest court in 1986 ruled that a warrantless 
search by santa clara calif police in an airplane had not 
violated privacy rights 
in that case police spotted marijana plants growing in a 
fencedin yard while flying at a lawful altitude of 1000 feet 
voting 54 then the justices said the constitutions fourth 
amendment which bans unreasonable government searches simply 
does not require the police traveling in public airways at this 
altitude 1000 feet to obtain a warrant in order to observe what 
is visible to the naked eye 
in the florida case pasco county deputies received an anonymous 
tip that michael a riley was growing marijuana in his yard 
unable to tell what plants were growing in a greenhouse in the 
yard the deputies flew over the yard in a helicopter at an 
altitude of about 400 feet from there they could look into 
missing panels in the greenhouse roof 
based on what they saw the deputies obtained a search warrant 
and entered rileys yard seizing 44 marijuana plants 
riley challenged the helicopter search seeking to block 
prosecutors from using the marijuana plants as evidence against him 
the florida supreme court last july 9 ruled for riley stating 
that the helicopter search violated rileys reasonable expectation 
of privacy under the fourth amendment 
the state court said the 1986 decision did not authorize an 
unlimited right to any type of examination of residential property 
from the air 
the state court added surveillance by helicopter is 
particularly likely to unreasonably intrude upon private activities 
because of a helicopters virtually unlimited maneuverability 
and observational capabilities 
it noted that fixedwing airplanes are not authorized to fly 
lower than 500 feet in the area where the search occurred 
florida prosecutors filed the appeal acted on today 
the case is florida vs riley 87764

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may tax any income from oil and natural gas 
extracted from the outer continental shelf 
the court said it will hear an appeal by shell oil co 
challenging an iowa tax 
the state tax is designed to be imposed on that portion of a 
companys income derived from doing business in iowa 
shell oil said it was improper for state officials to include 
any revenue from offshore gas and oil in determining the companys 
taxable income 
shell said the state tax violates a 1953 federal law authorizing 
exploration and production of outer continental shelf oil and gas 
the shelf is underwater land more than three miles off the shore 
of any state the land is owned by the federal government and 
leased to private companies 
the iowa supreme court upheld the state tax last october it 
said the levy is in no way dependent upon the exercise of 
legislative jursidiction on outer continental shelf lands that 
the 1953 federal law was intended to prohibit 
including revenue from ocs oil and gas apparently aids in 
obtaining an accurate measure of the tax to be imposed as a result 
of shells iowa activities the state court said 
the reagan administration agreed with the ruling of the iowa 
court but urged the us supreme court to use shells appeal to 
settle the dispute 
justice department lawyers noted that the iowa case would be a 
good one for the high court to use in examining state tax authority 
because the iowa tax takes into account sales both on and off the 
outer continental shelf 
the case is shell oil vs iowa 87984

the supreme court today refused to reconsider 
its 44 decision last december striking down an illinois law that 
could have made abortions more difficult to obtain for some 
teenagers 
the justices without comment rejected a request by illinois 
attorney general neil f hartigan that they restudy the law after 
the appointment of a ninth justice 
justice anthony m kennedy joined the court last thursday 
filling an eightmonth vacancy he did not participate in todays 
order denying reconsideration 
despite his 12year tenure as a federal appeals court judge 
kennedys legal views on abortion are unknown 
the high courts decision in december was not accompanied by a 
written opinion but merely upheld a ruling that the challenged 
illinois law impermissibly interfered with abortion rights 
such even splits among the justices automatically uphold lower 
court decisions in the particular cases but set no national 
precedent 
in seeking reconsideration hartigan emphasized the importance 
of a decision by a full court in the case 
the illinois law required that girls under 18 and still 
financially dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours 
before having an abortion 
the law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if she 
could prove to a state judge that she was mature enough and 
wellinformed enough to make the decision on her own and that 
notifying her parents would not be in her best interest 
doctors who failed to comply with the laws requirement faced 
criminal prosecution 
a federal appeals court ruled that the 24hour waiting period is 
an impermissible infringement on the right to have an abortion 
established by a landmark 1973 supreme court decision 
the appeals court also said the illinois law provision for 
parental notification or judicial permission could not be enforced 
because it did not ensure confidentiality and anonymity for girls 
who appeal when a judge denies permission for an abortion

the supreme court today said it will consider 
reversing a victory basketball coach jerry tarkanian won in his 
legal battle with the ncaa 
the justices agreed to review a decision barring the ncaa from 
suspending tarkanian as coach at the university of nevadalas vegas 
for alleged recruiting and other violations 
lower courts also awarded tarkanian substantial reimbursement 
for legal expenses 
tarkanian who has coached at unlv since 1973 during a highly 
successful 30year career was accused by the national collegiate 
athletic association in 1976 of numerous rule violations 
ncaa officials said tarkanian arranged for a student to get a 
b grade without attending class provided free air fare to a 
studentathlete encouraged individuals to give the ncaa false 
information to impede its probe falsely certified unlvs program 
as being in compliance with ncaa rules and failed to comport with 
high ethical standards 
the ncaa placed the unlv basketball program on two years 
probation in 1977 for recruiting violations and ordered the 
university to suspend tarkanian from coaching for two years 
but tarkanian obtained a court order blocking the suspension and 
continued coaching 
the nevada supreme court ruled last august that the ncaa 
violated tarkanians constitutional rights by failing to afford him 
due process in its 2year investigation 
the state court said the probe was based largely on 
recollections by investigators of interviews with their sources 
notes of the interviews sometimes were dictated after the fact the 
state court said 
it also said tarkanian and unlv officials presented signed 
affidavits by those the ncaa interviewed in which the witnesses 
contradicted the ncaas evidence 
in the circumstances of this case this procedure does not 
comport with due process requirements the state court said 
the state court also ruled that the ncaa a private organization 
representing nearly 1000 colleges and universities acted in the 
capacity of the state in depriving tarkanian of his rights 
purely private organizations cannot violate anyones 
constitutional rights 
the nevada supreme court said the ncaa is vested with state 
power in this case because tarkanian works for a state school 
the right to discipline public employees is traditionally the 
exclusive prerogative of the state the nevada court said unlv 
cannot escape responsibility for disciplinary action against 
employees by delegating that duty to a private entity the ncaa 
a state court judge awarded tarkanian 200000 in legal fees 
the state supreme court said the the sum should be reduced and 
ordered further hearings to determine the amount 
in the appeal acted on today ncaa officials said tarkanian was 
treated fairly 
they also argued that tarkanian got a home court advantage 
by taking his case to a nevada state judge who overruled the 
findings of the ncaa investigators 
the judge ruled in favor of a popular local personality 
substituting his views for that of 21 independent teachers and 
administrators who heard all of the evidence the ncaas appeal 
said 
the case is ncaa vs tarkanian 871061

flash floods roared through 
central south africa today killing at least 12 people and leaving 
hundreds of others without homes 
up to 12 inches of rain soaked parts of orange free state 
province during the weekend washing out roads bursting dams and 
flooding huge stretches of farmland authorities said 
military helicopters plucked 200 people from houses trees cars 
and areas inaccessible by road the air force reported 
telephone lines were down in many areas and the city of 
bloemfontein the capital of the orange free state only could be 
reached by air officials said 
rivers in the region have overflowed their banks and many small 
towns have been evacuated officials added heavy rains were

the supreme court today agreed to judge the 
validity of a 5 percent tax illinois imposes on all telephone calls 
charged to instate numbers 
the court said it will study arguments that the tax interferes 
impermissibly with interstate commerce 
the tax is assessed at a flat rate on all calls intrastate and 
interstate charged to illinois service addresses 
two state residents jerome f goldberg and robert mctigue 
challenged the law in a classaction lawsuit three years ago in 
chicago gte sprint communications corp joined the case later 
seeking to recover taxes already paid 
from sept 15 1985 to july 1986 gte sprint paid 26 million 
in taxes under the challenged illinois telecommunications excise 
tax 
the illinois supreme court upheld the tax last june 24 
reversing a state appeals court ruling that had invalidated it 
the appeals court had said illinois is attempting to tax the 
entire cost of an interstate act which takes place only partially 
in illinois 
the appeals court had added this tax discriminates 
against interstate commerce and it is not related to services 
provided in illinois 
the state supreme court acknowledged that illinois is taxing the 
gross charge of an entire interstate call even though the 
benefits it affords are limited to that portion of the 
communication occurring within the state 
but it said the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce 
the two state residents and gte sprint filed separate supreme 
court appeals and the national taxpayers union urged the justices 
as a friend of the court to strike down the tax 
its brief argued 
if illinois attempted to tax united parcel service on the 
entire value of its service for all packages picked up in the 
state regardless of where they were delivered that tax would fall 
before the constitutions commerce clause telecommunications 
companies whether they are in the telephone telegraph or 
electronic data transmission business provide a service which for 
many purposes is functionally identical 
the cases are goldberg vs sweet 87826 and gte sprint vs 
sweet 871101

an amtrak official defended the actions of 
crew members aboard a train that caught fire over the weekend 
saying that despite passenger complaints several lives may have 
been saved 
passengers aboard amtraks california zephyr said they received 
no warnings or instructions from crew members after the fire broke 
out early saturday killing a chef and injuring 19 other people 
i think our onboard crews initial instinct was to make sure 
passengers werent in any danger from the fire then they had to 
get employees out of the car said amtrak spokesman john jacobsen 
in a telephone interview from washington 
we could have easily had four or five employees killed in that 
dormitory car yesterday jacobsen said 
however the actions of a conductor and his assistant may have 
saved several lives jacobsen said 
conductor jp jones of arvada colo and assistant conductor 
todd m witaker of denver separated the crew car from the trains 
baggage car and engine to reach people endangered by the smoke 
jacobsen said 
the fire aboard the 14car westbound train carrying 294 
passengers and a crew of 18 was reported about 3 am as the train 
was pulling into hastings for a scheduled stop hastings fire chief 
jim mitera said the blaze was under control about 90 minutes later 
passenger sara bentley of fremont said later it was a miracle no 
one panicked 
i think the worse thing was that they didnt let anyone in our 
car know whether we were in danger ms bentley said we 
couldnt find out if our car was safe 
jacobsen said an amtrak investigation was continuing and that 
no disciplinary action had been taken against any crew members the 
national transportation safety board also was investigating 
jacobsen said the fire may have been caused by luggage or some 
other flammable material placed near a heater in a crew car 
contrary to earlier findings by the nebraska state fire marshals 
office that pointed to an electrical short in the heater 
amtrak investigators didnt find evidence of a short jacobsen 
said state fire marshal wally barnett said he would stand by the 
state report 
were fire investigators and we think were right barnett 
said sunday 
the victim identified as chef cesar arguelles 70 of chicago 
was one of seven crew members on the car jacobsen said county 
attorney gary anderberg said an autopsy showed the chef died of 
smoke inhalation 
nine crew members and three passengers were treated for smoke 
inhalation at mary lanning hospital all but two had been released 
by this morning nursing supervisor mona mueller said those two 
were in satisfactory condition and were expected to be released 
today 
jacobsen said the fire probably would prompt amtrak officials to 
renew their search for an effective smoke alarm for their trains 
but no models work now because they are often set off by the 
constant vibrations of trains he said

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that forces ann arbor mich city officials to justify in federal 
court a zoning ordinance limiting where adult bookstores may be 
opened for business 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments aimed at 
squelching a lawsuit challenging the ordinance 
the ordinance limits the area where adult bookstores may locate 
to a portion of downtown ann arbor representing less than 1 percent 
of the land within the citys 253 square miles 
adult bookstores are defined by the ordinance as those where 
sexually explicit materials comprise more than 20 percent of the 
stock in trade so any business establishment anywhere in the 
city may have up to 20 percent of its trade in adult materials 
karen christy who sought to operate an adult bookstore in an 
area not zoned for adult entertainment sued the city she sought 
to block enforcement of the zoning ordinance 
us district judge charles joiner refused to block enforcement 
ruling that the ordinance is not impermissibly restrictive 
the 20 percent requirement provides a beneficial way for 
decentralization of the adult book business he said by 
sanctioning the selling of adult books and other books together 
the city has eliminated most of the wellknown problems of urban 
blight that result from concentrations of these bookstores without 
sacrificing its citizens first amendment freedoms joiner said 
but the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled last july 23 
that joiner was wrong 
a city cannot arbitrarily limit the exercise of first 
amendment rights the appeals court said a limitation of adult 
materials to 20 percent of a booksellers wares conditions the 
constitutional right to speak in one way on the booksellers 
willingness to speak in a different way 80 percent of the time 
the appeals court sent the case back to joiner for further study 
after saying it found no evidence of a legitimate government 
objective for the passage of this zoning ordinance 
in the appeal acted on today city officials argued among other 
things that the constitutions first amendment does not guarantee 
the existence of adult bookstores if the right of access to such 
materials may be accommodated in other ways 
the case is ann arbor vs christy 87649

south african pilot was missing after his plane was shot down in 
southeast angola during a weekend air raid 
the plane was struck by ground fire while attacking cuban and 
angolan government troops during a battle saturday the military 
said it was the second time during south africas fivemonth 
intervention in angola that it acknowledged losing one of its 
warplanes inside the country 
the angolan news agency angop reported today that angolan 
government troops shot down two south african jetfighters over the 
weekend and have scored significant gains in recent battles against 
south african units and the angolan rebel movement unita 
south africa launched two other air attacks saturday in southern 
angola against bases of the southwest african peoples 
organization known as swapo in retaliation for the bombing friday 
of a bank in southwest africa the death toll in the bombing 
reached 20 southwest african police said today 
south africa also announced that it followed up the air attacks 
with longrange mortar bombardments saturday and sunday on swapo 
positions the military said the mortar attacks were 
successful but did not disclose any details 
south africa occupies southwest africa also known as namibia 
in violation of a united nations resolution its forces regularly 
enter angola to raid swapo bases 
during the saturday afternoon attack a plane piloted by maj 
edward every was downed by ground fire the military said adding 
that the air raid was staged because the angolancuban forces 
posed a potential threat to south african troops

of the downed south african pilots as maj every and said angolan 
officials had recovered his personal effects 
the report did not specify whether every was in angolan custody

agreement with angolas marxist government which is backed by 
cuban and soviet forces

south african soldiers are deployed in southern angola he also 
said south africa has staged 16 air raids so far this year and 
that six south african planes have been shot down and 140 of that 
nations soldiers have been killed

the extent of its military involvement in angola however it has 
announced the deaths of more than 30 soldiers since november

crashed in angola while participating in an attack on swapo forces

got 64 million in federal matching funds based on his total 
fundraising from last year dole got 12 million in contributions 
and 56 million in matching funds during january and kemp raised 
1 million in donations 39 million in matching funds and 
750000 in loans 
on the democratic side sen paul simon of illinois and rep 
richard gephardt of missouri both went into februarys iowa 
caucuses and new hampshire primary in debt and had to take out 
loans 
both have said their fundraising has improved since then 
democrats michael dukakis the massachusetts governor and sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee on the other hand apparently were in 
good shape dukakis with 4 million in the bank and gore with 2

the supreme court today agreed to hear appeals 
by the reagan administration and coal mining companies seeking to 
block the possible award of billions of dollars in black lung 
disease benefits to thousands of miners 
the court said it will review a ruling that the government must 
reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits 
the administration said the ruling by a federal appeals court 
if extended nationwide could force officials to reexamine 94000 
claims at potentially tremendous cost to the overburdened fund that 
pays benefits to miners afflicted with the disease 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last march ruled that 
thousands of miners seeking the benefits had been unfairly denied a 
hearing 
the ruling applied to miners with less than 10 years of work in 
the mines whose claims were denied in the late 1970s and early 
1980s 
the appeals court said the us department of labor must take a 
fresh look at the claims under liberalized standards adopted by 
congress in 1977 the appeals court applied the ruling to miners 
who failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or who missed 
deadlines for filing court appeals 
the appeals court said miners seeking benefits have 
encountered enormous frustration in the processing of their claims 
due to administrative delays and determinations under improper 
standards congress has repeatedly attempted to ease the burden of 
proof of disability and to expedite black lung claims 
the justice department said the ruling would force the labor 
department to embark on a potentially enormous reopening of 
closed cases that will impose a massive administrative burden the 
records for approximately 94000 claims would have to be retrieved 
and analyzed if the appeals court ruling were to apply nationwide 
the 8th circuit court has jurisdiction in north and south 
dakota minnesota nebraska iowa arkansas and missouri 
congress has created a special fund to pay off claims for miners 
with black lung disease also known as pneumonconiosis 
coal mine operators owe the government some 3 billion that has 
been loaned to the fund from the federal treasury 
the operators said the 8th circuit court ruling if applied 
nationwide could burden the industry with 136 billion in 
additional payments 
the us treasury will be required to borrow the money to pay 
these claims until the coal industry is able to do so if that day 
ever comes 
in another dispute over black lung benefits the supreme court 
in december made it easier for mining companies to block the award 
of some disability benefits that decision upheld a labor 
department rule that miners are not entitled to an interim 
presumption they were disabled by the disease based on a single 
piece of medical evidence

87821 and whitfield vs sebben 87827

the supreme court today threw out an appeal by 
seven tennessee families who say their religious freedom was 
violated when their children were exposed to godless public 
school textbooks 
it also agreed to study a key affirmative action issue the 
power of local governments to require minority participation in 
public works projects 
and it agreed to judge the validity of a federal law creating 
independent counsels to investigate alleged wrongdoing by 
highranking executive branch officials 
it was justice anthony m kennedys first day on the court 
which was at full strength for the first time since last june 26 
when justice lewis f powell retired 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that requiring 
the fundamentalist christian children to read the books was 
constitutional 
todays action essentially ends a widely publicized case some 
have called scopes ii a comparison to the furor surrounding the 
1925 prosecution of john scopes in tennessee for teaching evolution 
the controversy began in 1983 when the hawkins county board of 
education adopted a new reading list for students in grades 18 
pupils initially were allowed to read from other textbooks if they 
desired but the school board later eliminated that alternative 
all county schoolchildren were required to read the chosen 
textbooks or leave public school 
the seven families who filed the appeal acted on today sued the 
county school board in late 1983 listing more than 300 objections 
to the assigned readings 
the lawsuit objected on religious grounds to themes or passages 
in such works as the wizard of oz and cinderella science 
fiction by isaac asminov fairy tales by hans christian andersen 
and stories by anthropologist margaret mead among others 
the lawsuit said the books in dispute violated the families 
beliefs by teaching evolution secular humanism the occult 
feminism and other beliefs theories or philosophies they consider 
godless 
a federal trial judge ruled for the families finding that their 
religious freedom had been violated and awarding them 50000 in 
damages 
he ruled that the children should have been allowed to opt 
out of the reading program while enjoying the rest of the public 
school curriculum 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling and 
threw out the families lawsuit 
the only conduct compelled was reading and discussing the 
material and hearing other students interpretation of those 
materials the appeals court said what is absent from this 
case is the critical element of compulsion to affirm or deny a 
religious belief or to engage or refrain from engaging in a 
practice forbidden or required in the exercise of any childs 
religion 
in seeking supreme court review lawyers for the families said 
the case presents a classic confrontation between parents and 
public school officials over the education of children 
they said children should not be required to read religiously 
offensive books as a condition of remaining in school 
the appeal likened the families objections to those made by 
jehovahs witnesses families that sparked the supreme courts 1943 
decision striking down a west virginia law that required all public 
school students to participate in the daily recitings of the pledge 
of allegiance 
the appeal added the rule emerging from the 6th circuit 
ruling is that children can be forced to read books which violate 
their sincere religious beliefs so long as they are not forced to 
believe the contents of what they have read 
tennessee attorney general wj michael cody said expressed 
pleasure at the decision and said any alternative disposition 
would have been the cause of chaos in the school system 
but mike farris attorney for concerned women of america who 
represented the east tennessee families called for the removal of 
all bornagain christian children from the public school system as 
a result of the decision 
in the affirmative action case the justices said they will hear 
an appeal by richmond va officials seeking to revive a socalled 
setaside program for construction industry businesses owned by 
minorities 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled last september that 
the citys preferential treatment for minority businesses approved 
in 1983 is an unconstitutional form of reverse discrimination 
setting the stage for a major constitutional decision over 
independent counsels the justices said they will review an appeals 
court ruling that the watergateera law impermissibly gives 
presidential powers to the federal courts 
the decision expected by july will affect the criminal 
conviction of former white house aide michael k deaver and the 
stalled investigation of exjustice department official theodore b 
olson 
in a separate order the court rejected marine lt col oliver 
norths latest attempt to block an investigation of his role in the 
irancontra affair it let stand a ruling that north may not halt 
the criminal investigation by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
by challenging its legality in a civil lawsuit 
in other action the court 
refused to let a texas hospital withhold the names of its 
blood donors from a woman who says her baby daughter contracted 
aids after receiving transfusions 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the donors 
privacy rights do not override belinda jacksons need to find out 
their identities in her wrongfuldeath lawsuit against the hospital 
agreed to hear appeals by the reagan administration and coal 
mining companies seeking to block the possible award of billions of 
dollars in black lung disease benefits to thousands of miners 
the court said it will review a ruling that the government must 
reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits 
let stand a ruling that drastically limits the power of 
communities to regulate cable television and raises doubts about 
the constitutionality of a key federal law governing cable 
operations 
the court citing a lack of jurisdiction turned away an appeal 
by two california cities barred from enforcing public access and 
other rules challenged by a cable operator 
agreed to decide when police need court warrants before 
searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fencedin yards 
the justices said they will study a florida supreme court ruling 
that a helicopter search by sheriffs deputies in pasco county four 
years ago violated the right of privacy 
the textbook case is mozert vs hawkins county public schools

democratic presidential contender michael dukakis said today at 
the white house that the reagan administrations antiterrorist 
policy is worthless because of arms dealing with iran in the 
midwest republican bob dole taunted george bush for refusing to 
compete in minnesota and south dakota 
dukakis speaking to reporters after a national governors 
association meeting with the president said id have a much 
tougher and much more consistent antiterrorist policy 
the massachusetts governor referring to the sale of arms to 
iran during secret negotiations to free american hostages said 
well be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985 
for a long time 
you never ever make concessions to terrorism if you ever do 
it then your policy is worthless and thats what we did said 
dukakis 
asked about dukakis statement white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said i think its very dangerous to make terrorism a 
political issue especially when youre talking about specific 
episodes 
vice president bush who has said repeatedly he supported 
reagans iran initiative but was involved with few details was 
campaigning in south carolina today but dole in duluth minn 
was suggesting bush wasnt where he should have been 
minnesota and south dakota the next two events on the long road 
to the 1988 presidential nominations vote on tuesday 
were ready to do well here tomorrow were here to play 
dole told supporters in duluth today 
i dont know where george bush is dole said i didnt 
find him yesterday in wyoming couldnt find him in south dakota 
couldnt find him in minnesota must be somewhere and these are 
very important states later today were going to send him a map of 
minnesota so at least he gets a little idea where it is 
among the democrats richard gephardt who also finished first 
in iowa is bidding for a strong showing in south dakotas 
democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the campaign moves 
toward the super tuesday showdown on march 8 
the 4067 minnesota caucuses are the first step toward choosing 
78 delegates to the democratic national convention while on the 
republican side caucus attendees will mark a nonbinding straw 
ballot to express their presidential preference 
in south dakotas primary republican voters will determine 
allocation of 18 convention delegates while the democrats will 
hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on 
who gets the states national convention delegates 
bush faced with the potential of a repeat of the iowa results 
in which midwesterner dole was a big winner is concentrating on 
the south where he hopes to cripple the kansas senators effort 
dole is a strong favorite in south dakota while minnesota is 
shaping up as a threeway fight between dole rep jack kemp of new 
york and former television evangelist pat robertson 
dukakis winner of the new hampshire democratic presidential 
primary is campaigning hard in both these upper midwest states in 
an effort to prove he can win support outside his native new 
england 
after an appearance at the national governors association 
meeting in washington including a session with president reagan 
dukakis was flying to minnesota to campaign 
on his way into the white house for a blacktie dinner sunday 
night dukakis quipped im just looking the place over thats 
all asked where he hoped to be next year dukakis replied i 
hope right here 
gephardt who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances 
a cornerstone of his campaign got a blow from his house colleagues 
when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that 
would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade 
surpluses with the united states through unfair practices 
were going to dump it because its bad policy said rep 
sam gibbons dfla chairman of the trade subcommittee of the 
house ways and means committee 
im going to fight for my amendment said gephardt when 
told of the plan 
much of the sniping between presidential rivals was being done 
by long distance 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee who made little effort in 
iowa and not much more in new hampshire while pursuing a southern 
strategy for the democratic nomination was interviewed on the nbc 
show meet the press on sunday and got in jabs at both dukakis 
and gephardt 
the senator attacked gephardt for shifting positions its not 
a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has 
changed 180 degrees said gore there is a long long list of 
issues 
turning to dukakis gore said the governor has not had a 
single days experience in foreign policy 
dukakis spokesman leslie dach quickly retorted that al gores 
never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an 
economy 
gephardt was attacking dukakis in ads running in south dakota 
that criticize the massachusetts governor for not supporting farm 
legislation sponsored by gephardt and iowa sen tom harkin the ads 
also take a shot at dukakis for once suggesting in iowa that 
farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as belgian 
endive 
the ads drew retorts from dukakis supporters in both minnesota 
and south dakota 
a new low in south dakota presidential politics said state 
sen roger mckellips a cochairman of dukakis south dakota 
campaign 
after his surprising secondplace finish in the iowa caucuses 
robertson was considered a strong contender in minnesota where 
caucus organization is once again important 
the former evangelist was in spartanburg sc on sunday and 
told a crowd of about 4000 at a church dedication that the 
problem facing america is not a government problem but a moral 
problem

pentecostal leaders and worshipers expressed sympathy jim 
bakker offered advice tammy bakker cried and jessica hahn said she 
was shocked after tv evangelist jimmy swaggart quit his pulpit 
because of a reported sex scandal 
swaggart tearfully told his congregation in baton rouge la on 
sunday that he would leave his ministry for an undetermined 
indeterminate period of time because he had sinned 
many members of the congregation gathered around swaggart after 
the service to cry pray and hold hands 
i think hes truly repentant and i think hes set a 
tremendous example for all of us of what true repentance is 
about said congregant evelyn murray 
swaggart said the future of his ministry was up to the lord and 
officials of his denomination the assemblies of god who 
reportedly were reviewing photographs purporting to show swaggart 
and a prostitute entering and leaving a motel room 
church officials and congregants praised the candor of the 
evangelist whose broadcasts reach into more than 100 countries and 
whose ministry had an income estimated at 142 million in 1986 
forest h hall secretarytreasurer of the assemblies he and his wife 
tammy were kind of sick to our stomachs 
over the news of swaggarts problems and added our heart goes 
out to them and their family 
my advice to jimmy would be dont do anything for about a 
month and just pray and then make decisions i made a very bad 
mistake by making decisions too quick bakker said 
bakker resigned from his ptl ministry in march and later was 
defrocked by the assemblies of god after admitting to a sexual 
encounter with miss hahn a church secretary 
mrs bakker said she cried when she heard about swaggarts 
troubles i just felt like i didnt want anyone to suffer the way 
our family has had to suffer this last year she said sunday 
we love him and were praying for him 
the rev jerry falwell who took over the ptl ministry for eight 
months after bakker left said i am deeply saddened over this 
tragedy with the credibility crisis in recent days involving wall 
street the world of politics and the arena of religion many 
sincere people have had their faith shattered 
david clark the trustee of ptl appointed by us bankruptcy 
court said its hard to assess the impact on the socalled 
electronic church im sure our telephones will tell us tomorrow 
what theyre thinking 
miss hahn who accepted secret payments from ptl to cover up her 
encounter with bakker said she expected swaggarts troubles to 
affect contributors 
when they turn on the tv theyre going to see a preacher and 
wonder if this offering is paying hush money or for a prostitute 
i just feel bad she said 
miss hahn said she had heard months ago swaggart was going to be 
involved in the current controversy but when she learned of his 
public confession i almost fell on the floor 
what shocked me was that he resigned i feel really bad about 
this it hit me i think that theres too many preachers hanging 
vendettas over each other she said in a telephone interview from 
the playboy mansion where she lives in los angeles

legislation to replace the fivemember nuclear 
regulatory commission with a nuclear safety agency headed by a 
single administrator was approved monday by a senate subcommittee 
sponsors of the package said the change is needed to end 
internal battling at the nrc help restore public confidence in 
nuclear power and provide better inspection and regulation of 
commercial generators 
the bill worked out by sens john breaux dla and alan 
simpson rwy also would create a nuclear reactor safety 
investigations board to conduct independent reviews of major 
accidents and safety problems at nuclear facilities 
the package also sets up an inspector general to monitor 
internal operations of the nuclear licensing agency and create an 
office of investigations to look for wrongdoing by nuclear 
licensees 
breaux said it is only through a program of more effective 
regulation that the confidence of the american people in the 
benefits of this technology will be restored 
the record amply demonstrates that the nuclear regulatory 
commission is a collegial body that rarely makes its most important 
decisions collegially breaux said 
discussing the commissioners simpson said they dont 
communicate with each other he said the nrc suffers from a 
pernicious diffusion of accountability and responsibility that 
produces indecisive ineffective inefficient regulation of the 
commercial nuclear industry 
frank ingram a spokesman for the nrc said the agency had no 
immediate comment on the details of the legislation but added that 
a majority of the commission supports a single administrator 
concept 
the bill was approved by voice vote of the environment and 
public works subcommittee on nuclear regulation

the united states and soviet union today gave 
their arms control negotiators one month to complete the key 
provisions of a new treaty to sharply reduce their strategic 
nuclear weapons 
the decision was taken as us secretary of state george p 
shultz wound up two days of talks in moscow he said negotiators in 
geneva who have so far failed to make significant progress toward a 
50 percent cut in longrange nuclear weapons were directed to 
report to him and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in 
washington march 2223 
in another development soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov 
announced the soviet union would begin to withdraw its 
shorterrange ss12 missiles from east germany and czechoslovakia 
late this month as a display of goodwill 
elimination of the missiles is required under the 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons treaty president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed in december the treaty 
has not yet been ratified in the soviet union or united states 
last week the east german news agency adn reported that troops 
had begun dismantling ss12s based in waren east germany 
shultz also told a news conference the soviets indicated they 
would be more flexible in handling emigration applications except 
for those from people who have had access to state secrets 
shevardnadze confirmed categorically that only those with 
information the government considers important to national security 
would be barred from emigrating according to shultz 
earlier today as he opened talks with shultz gorbachev pledged 
to achieve peace in afghanistan and to try to reach a new nuclear 
arms agreement by spring 
shultz and the sov munist party general secretary smiled 
broadly as they shook hands and sat down with their aides in 
opulent catherines hall in the kremlin 
at a picturetaking session gorbachev said the soviets would 
do our best to achieve peace in afghanistan and to have a 
nonaligned neutral afghanistan whici would have good relations 
with its neighors with the united states and with the soviet 
union 
at the news conference shultz said he did not have the 
slightest doubt that the soviet union would leave afghanistan 
but shultz who came here saying he would seek a specific 
timetable gave no evidence he had received one 
an estimated 115000 soviet troops have been in afghanistan 
since december 1979 backing a promoscow government at war with 
usarmed moslem guerrillas 
gorbachev has promised to begin a withdrawal on may 15 if the 
kabul government and pakistan can agree on terms of a settlement by 
march 15 
shultz who arrived in moscow on sunday met until 130 am 
today with shevardnadze then held talks with premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov before meeting gorbachev 
after the talks shultz did not say whether the soviets agreed 
to support the sevenmonth us effort in the united nations to 
impose a worldwide arms embargo against iran for refusing to comply 
with a unordered ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
shultz also vehemently denied that he sought soviet backing for 
his middle east peace initiative 
i didnt come here with my hat in hand looking for support 
he said 
he said the parties in the region arabs and israelis would 
determine whether his trip to the middle east later this week will 
succeed 
the secretary of state has questioned whether the soviet union 
can play a bigger role in that region because of its human rights 
record and its lack of relations with israel 
on nuclear arms gorbachev said there is still a chance of 
an agreement to reduce by half us and soviet longrange nuclear 
weapons by the spring the idea would be to have the pact ready for 
him and reagan to sign at a moscow summit 
gorbachev and reagan signed an agreement in washington dec 8 to 
eliminate their intermediaterange missiles which have a range of 
about 300 to 3000 miles the current negotiations in geneva 
concern those with a range above 3000 miles 
the geneva talks have been held up because of disagreements over 
the future of reagans star wars antimissile program and how 
to verify any new arms treaty 
shultz said the negotiators would have until his meeting in 
washington with shevardnadze to put together three draft documents 
dealing with verification procedures ways to eliminate or convert 
the weapons and methods to help inspectors observe treaty 
compliance 
on sunday shultz quizzed andrei d sakharov about human rights 
arms control and soviet reforms and met with a group of jewish 
refuseniks to underscore us concern for human rights in the 
soviet union 
sakharov who won the 1975 nobel peace prize for his efforts to 
protect human rights met with reporters after seeing shultz 
sakharov said the soviet union has not yet made enough progress 
to merit holding an international human rights conference as a 
precondition for such a conference i see the liberation of all 
prisoners of conscience and the complete end of the war in 
afghanistan he said 
sakharov a physicist helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb 
in the 1950s he was exiled to the closed city of gorky in january 
1980 for speaking out against the soviet military intervention in 
afghanistan

unsuccessfully for congress in 1980 said hell focus on a single 
theme between now and november what has weicker done for 
connecticut 
the populist attorney general attacked weicker for using the 
senate as a debating society for his own agenda issues that 
dont do much for the average person 
as attorney general lieberman has seized on nonpartisan 
consumer and environmental issues such as grocery store coupon 
ripoffs increased electric rates and dumping sewage into the 
connecticut river 
the candidates will be determined at state party conventions 
this summer so far weicker is unopposed and lieberman has only 
token opposition from gary johnson who describes himself as a

into windows at the sears tower early today damaging 90 panes and 
forcing police to close streets around the worlds tallest 
building authorities said 
but police said there were no reports of injuries from falling 
glass 
initially building officials reported that 19 windows were 
broken and six others were cracked on the east and southeast sides 
of the 110story building said ernie arms a spokesman for sears 
roebuck and co whose corporate headquarters are in the building 
a survey later in the morning by building engineers found that 
90 windows were broken or cracked as the wind gusted to 56 mph he 
said 
theyre not blown out arms said what happened is 
something flying through the air like a pebble from the roof of 
another building hit and broke one window and then others were 
damaged as that one window came down 
the broken and cracked windows were located between the 50th and 
88th floors and are among 16000 windows in the 1454foot tall

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
broadening protection for criminal defendants who claim they were 
denied adequate help by lawyers in filing appeals 
the court said it will review a ruling that threw out an appeal 
by an ohio man convicted of rape robbery and assault 
the defendant steven anthony penson was convicted of charges 
stemming from a breaking and entry by three men into a montgomery 
county ohio home on aug 4 1984 
the three intruders sexually assaulted a man and two women and 
also robbed the home 
after penson was convicted and sentenced to 18 to 28 years in 
prison his attorney refused to file an appeal on grounds there was 
no meritorious issue for an appeals court to consider lawyers 
for pensons two convicted codefendants did appeal their 
convictions 
pensons lawyer then withdrew from representing him and penson 
filed his own appeal 
an ohio appeals court said it was troubled by the conduct of 
pensons lawyer but the appeals court said we find penson has 
suffered no prejudice in his counsels failure to give a more 
conscientious examination of the record 
the appeals court upheld pensons conviction 
the ohio public defenders office that was later assigned to the 
case said in its appeal to the supreme court that pensons rights 
were violated 
the public defender said the burden of proving penson received 
ineffective legal assistance in pursuing his appeal improperly was 
placed on the defendant the public defender argued that penson 
should not be required to show specific omissions or errors to 
establish a presumption he received inadequate representation 
pensons original lawyer in refusing to file the appeal failed 
the requirement that he state in writing the grounds that arguably 
could support an appeal the public defender said 
the public defender urged the supreme court to elaborate on a 
1967 ruling that set some standards to judge the effectiveness of 
lawyers handling appeals 
the case is penson vs ohio 876116

leaders in both political parties trying to assay the 
hardtomeasure strength of pat robertson say they expect hell 
win some southern republican presidential primaries on super 
tuesday come in second in others and pick up a substantial share 
of the 700 delegates up for grabs that day 
interviews by associated press reporters in the 16 states 
holding republican primaries or caucuses on march 8 underscore that 
the former television evangelist is a wild card his strength 
unfathomable but clearly formidable 
weve got seven phone lines and theyre jammed with calls 
these days says north carolina gop chairman jack hawke people 
are asking questions you just dont hear a lot how is a precinct 
organized how is a person registered it leads me to believe they 
robertson supporters are active across the state 
says hawkes democratic counterpart jim van hecke i think 
hes scared the established republican party to death 
because many evangelical christians the core of robertsons 
support have not participated in the nominating process in the 
past his strength in competition with george bush bob dole and 
jack kemp is hard to gauge 
a new question mark is whether the weekend confession of moral 
waywardness of another television evangelist jimmy swaggart could 
have any fallout on robertson who made his fame preaching before 
the tv cameras 
i think bushs biggest competition in the south will come from 
robertson says political scientist merle black at the university 
of north carolina its not inconceivable that he could beat bush 
in some of these states 
political observers report that robertson appears weak in the 
three nonsouthern republican primaries massachusetts rhode 
island and missouri but jennifer dunn republican chairman in 
washington state which holds caucuses march 8 says bush dole and 
robertson are so closely clumped that a prediction is impossible 
i wouldnt be a bit surprised to see a 30 percent robertson 
turnout in the delegate selection with the other candidates 
splitting the rest mrs dunn says says robertson state chairman 
bruce hawkins were not just going to take it were going to 
sweep it 
south carolina which holds its primary on march 5 three days 
before super tuesday could be an early indicator of robertsons 
strength observers say a strong robertson showing there could give 
him a big boost throughout the south robertson claims he is ready 
to pull a stunner in south carolina 
republican primaries or caucuses will be held on super tuesday 
in 12 southern states alabama arkansas florida georgia 
kentucky louisiana maryland mississippi north carolina 
oklahoma tennessee and texas nearly a third of the gops 2277 
convention delegates will be selected on super tuesday 
i think robertson in tennessee is going to do pretty well 
said tommy harper tennessee campaign manager for bush a worker at 
bush headquarters speaking on condition she not be quoted by name 
goes further robertson is the one we are really worried about 
arkansas state democratic executive director kip blakely trying 
to assess robertsons support says remember the right to life 
march a couple of weekends ago it was raining and it was a 
saturday morning and it was freezing there were over 3000 people 
who turned out thats pat robertson 
blakely predicts robertson will win the arkansas primary i 
think its his 
robertson will probably come in second in georgia if he 
doesnt come in first says georgia gop chairman emeritus bob 
bell you dont know how many people are out there in the 
invisible army and how many will come out to vote but theyre 
committed with a burning zeal 
in precinct meetings 16 days ago robertson won a plurality of 
delegates to the county conventions which will be held in the 10 
largest counties in georgia only counties with populations over 
80000 held the meetings robertson chairman brant frost said 
robertsons support ranged from a low of 35 percent in fulton 
county atlanta to a high of 96 percent in bibb county 
next door in alabama steve french political director of the 
state gop sees no prospect of a robertson win 
texas is shaping up to be a bush vs robertson race bushs 
son george walker bush said last week in texas 
robertson is seen as a factor behind republican registration 
jumps in many states 
in louisiana robertson state director billy e mccormack 
citing a 6 percent jump in republican registration since october 
says we feel like we were responsible for 90 to 95 percent of 
them 
you take hopkins county a very conservative biblebelt area 
which had a 16 percent increase in republican registration from 
may to october observes stan b smith political director for 
the kentucky gop you got to feel if you put two and two 
together that a lot of that is robertson 
but bushs state chairman in kentucky harold rogers says of 
the robertson strength essentially its still limited to the 
religious conservatives i dont see him breaking out beyond that 
very narrow base except in spotty cases here and there

the new managers of united press international 
plan no hirings firings or changes in service for at least two 
months while they study the companys future the wire services 
new president said today 
everything is frozen during the study period paul steinle 
said in a news conference the new management team has not decided 
on what course to follow with the financially ailing company 
while steinle would not deal in specifics he said he believes 
that americas news executives want two wire services but he 
said he still needs to talk with people in the news industry 
because he and others want upi to become a marketdriven 
company 
the management and a team of 15 experts will interview the staff 
and media executives assess the companys financial situation and 
look at options for the next four to six weeks at that time they 
hope to have a business plan detailing the companys future 
steinle works for wnw group inc a media investment group whose 
chairman is dr earl w brian brian recently formed wnw a holding 
company to take control of upi from mexican publisher mario 
vazquez rana 
brian said wnw purchased control of vazquez ranas stock for 10 
years in upi for a substantial cash payment but he would not 
say how much the announcement was made late friday 
brian 45 is chairman of infotechnology corp a new york firm 
with at least partial interest in 22 companies including financial 
news network a cable tv service the companies are mostly in the 
area of information or venture capital 
brian served as secretary of californias health and welfare 
agency when ronald reagan was governor and went to the 1976 
republican national convention as a delegate in reagans 
unsuccessful bid to defeat gerald ford in 1974 he unsuccessfully 
sought the republican nomination for senate 
he told the los angeles times on sunday that revitalizing upi 
under american ownership was an important personal goal he added 
however that his conservative views would not influence news 
coverage 
this thing to me is just a little deeper than an issue of 
turning another company around brian said as a conservative 
republican as far as im concerned upi is an extremely important 
asset to american people 
giving the wire service new emphasis in such areas as financial 
news and sports scores using new technologies for delivery are 
being considered he said referring to his business interests in 
those areas brian said we believe that a lot of this stuff can 
be done directly by upi itself 
to finance continuing losses at upi brian said he will ask 
private investors to put up money 
vazquez rana who paid 41 million to acquire upi from chapter 
11 proceedings in us bankruptcy court in june 1986 reportedly 
lost a million dollars a month on upi 
brian and steinle said they hoped to improve upis marketing 
capabilities and that brians presence would help 
the new managers will be doing it all in english brian 
said a reference to vazquez ranas inability to speak english 
meantime al rossiter upis executive editor said that 
morale is soaring at upi since the new managers took over 
one of the reasons brian could not purchase upi outright was an 
agreement that vazquez rana signed with the wire service guild 
giving the union the right of first refusal to buy upi 
the new upi managers plan to meet later today with the wire 
service guild 
earlier guild negotiator and spokesman dan carmichael said the 
union wants to see upi remain an integrated quality competitive 
general international news service 
a proxy represents a transfer of voting power represented by the 
ownership shares but not the shares themselves

the reagan administrations long and sometimes 
bumpy road to filling a vacant seat on the supreme court came to an 
anticlimactic end on monday justice anthony m kennedys first 
day on the bench 
the four hours of subdued technical arguments in the hushed 
crimsondraped courtroom were a sharp contrast to the noisy and 
partisan battles that preceded kennedys feb 3 confirmation by the 
senate 
kennedy looked solemn as he entered the chamber strode past the 
american flag stood before the pale marble columns and took his 
seat at the end of the row of nine justices that seat on the far 
right as spectators face the court is the traditional place for 
the high courts newest member 
a slight smile crossed kennedys face during a brief exchange 
with justice sandra day oconnor seated next to him just before 
chief justice william rehnquist opened the session 
the former appellate judge from sacramento calif a man with a 
reputation for being deliberative and well prepared didnt say a 
word until nearly an hour had elapsed and then he asked only one 
question 
the first argument of the four on mondays schedule concerned 
the state of mississippis attempt to undertake its own cost review 
of the grand gulf nuclear plant near vicksburg 
kennedy listened intently and took notes during the hour of 
technical discussion 
oconnor and justice antonin scalia the two most recent 
additions to the court before kennedy were among the most 
aggressive questioners in the first argument 
kennedy waited until its closing minutes to ask his first 
question from the bench of the high court 
is it fair to say he asked attorney john maxey 
representing the state of mississippi that all of the arguments 
that mississippi wants to present now could have been made 
before ferc even though ferc is being asked to draw a different 
conclusion 
maxey said no but kennedys question was answered in the 
affirmative by rex lee the former solicitor general today 
representing mississippi power amp light these matters can and 
must be raised before ferc if they are to be raised at all lee 
said 
the next three cases involved railroad worker lawsuits against 
employers a technicality concerning sex discrimination in state 
pension benefits and a surgeon suing fellow doctors over antitrust 
violations 
kennedys presence brought the court to full strength for the 
first time since justice lewis f powell resigned in june and it 
marked a return to business as usual following months of conflict 
between the administration and the senate 
the senate intensely scrutinized and ultimately rejected judge 
robert h bork the administrations first nominee its second 
nominee judge douglas h ginsberg withdrew after revelations that 
he had used marijuana 
although a conservative for 12 years on the federal bench 
kennedy is considered more moderate than either bork or ginsburg 
but little is known about his views on abortion regulation 
affirmative action churchstate relations or the other politically 
sensitive issues on which the court is closely divided

women students on both sides of the 
abortion issue are uneasily sharing the yale womens center this 
semester after the university overrode the centers decision to 
exclude opponents of abortion 
weve been meeting there once a week said senior kelly 
askew president of yale students for life its not entirely 
welcoming but its getting much better there was lots of 
anger bitter feelings 
askews group which has about 10 members asked the student 
coordinating committee of the womens center for permission to meet 
there last semester the committee said no largely because of 
differences over abortion 
the womens center in the basement of a campus building 
provides meeting space for several organizations including the 
staff of the student feminist magazine aurora the womens action 
coalition and a lesbian group 
the prolife stand made people uncomfortable said cory 
margenau a yale senior and a coordinating committee member it 
was a very unique situation with the womens center weve never 
had any groups who were supportive of prolife opinions try to come 
in 
when the coordinating committee rejected askews group she said 
she viewed it as discrimination 
we asked if they were violating the yale freedom of expression 
policy askew said the center is called the yale womens 
center and theres no denying the fact that we were all yale women 
i would have no argument if they called themselves the yale 
proabortion center 
she added there is a whole pressure here to be pc to be 
politically correct part of being pc is being proabortion 
the antiabortion group took the matter to yales 
administration and both sides met with patricia pierce associate 
dean of yale college 
sidney altman the dean of yale college made the final 
decision askew and margenau said 
an assistant to altman referred questions to pierce who said 
the dispute had to do with freedom of expression and not with 
ones personal political views 
pierce said that as a result of the dispute the deans office 
decided to spell out who was eligible to use the womens center 
groups primarily composed of undergraduate women and concerned with 
womens issues 
margenau said she now agrees with altmans decision that the 
center is yale property and should therefore be neutral but the 
womens center coordinating committee saw another issue take shape 
with his decision 
we the five coordinators learned how little power we really 
have when it comes to a mans decision the main problem was 
realizing who really had the power and it was dean altman and it 
was kind of a blow margenau said 
countered pierce all the associate deans are women and we 
were all in on the decision and we thought it an excellent one

the reagan administration said monday a 
videotape by marine lt col william higgins in which he repeated 
the demands of his captors in lebanon has no validity because it 
was made under duress 
all statements made by hostages are made under duress said 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley echoing a similar 
comment by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
mrs oakley noted that the demands including an israeli 
withdrawal from its border security zone in south lebanon are the 
same as those announced last friday by the organization of the 
opporessed on earth one of two groups which claim to have kidnaped 
higgins 
she also disputed a statement by peggy say sister of the 
longestheld american hostage in lebanon that the administration 
is displaying a double standard by working hardest to free captives 
seized most recently 
we all can understand and sympathize with her anguish and her 
frustration and her sorrow over her brothers continuing 
captivity mrs oakley said 
were making our efforts on behalf of all the hostages our 
goal is not the release of this one or that one but rather the safe 
return of all the hostages 
mrs says brother terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press was kidnapped on march 16 
1985 
mrs say contended that the us government has been less 
vigorous in seeking out her brother than higgins a onetime top 
aide to former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
at the white house fitzwater said the higgins videotape had 
been viewed by members of the national security council and white 
house staff but he did not believe president reagan had seen it 
we continue to call for the immediate and safe release of 
colonel higgins as well as other hostages in lebanon fitzwater 
said we are not going to give in to the demands of terrorists 
we will continue to pursue all avenues for his release 
asked if reagan had any reaction the spokesman said you know 
the presidents deep convictions about colonel higgins and all the 
hostages but we want to avoid saying anything that could 
exacerbate the situation

dr john allegro renowned for his work in 
deciphering the dead sea scrolls but ridiculed for his theories 
that western religions were based on the worship of mushrooms has 
died he was 65 
allegro died at his home on feb 17 his birthday according to 
death notices and obituaries published monday no cause of death 
was given he is to be cremated tuesday 
allegro was a brilliant student of semitic languages at 
manchester university and went on to study hebrew dialects at 
oxford university 
in 1953 he was named to an international team formed to 
decipher the dead sea scrolls which were discovered in caves at 
qumran on the shores of the dead sea six years earlier 
the scrolls which spanned from about 100 bc to 70 ad 
included the oldest known manuscripts of books from the old 
testament allegros gift for deciphering minute texts was crucial 
his book the dead sea scrolls was published in 1956 and 
became a bestseller 
allegros subsequent notoriety caused derision in the scientific 
community but developed a cult following in the early 1970s 
allegro in his 1970 book the sacred mushroom and the cross 
contended that judaism and christianity were in fact products of an 
ancient sexandmushroom cult 
he theorized that jesuss last words on the cross were not a 
lament to god but a paean of praise to the god of the mushroom 
although trained for the methodist ministry he became a fervent 
antichristian devoted to debunking the story of jesus 
allegro also published a 1966 book search in the desert 
about an unsuccessful search for lost scrolls in the judean desert 
he is survived by a son and a daughter

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that drastically limits the power of communities to regulate cable 
television and raises doubts about the constitutionality of a key 
federal law governing cable operations 
the court citing a lack of jurisdiction turned away an appeal 
by two california cities barred from enforcing public access and 
other rules challenged by a cable operator 
the courts action which appears to have been based on narrow 
procedural grounds leaves open the possibility of a subsequent 
appeal 
the dispute was between officials of palo alto and atherton 
calif and century federal inc the cable operator 
us district judge eugene f lynch ruled last september that 
cable regulations adopted by the cities unconstitutionally violated 
century federals freespeech rights 
he threw out regulations that required century federal 
to provide public access channels for those not connected with 
the cable company 
to wire the entire community to make service available to all 
residents 
to use a stateoftheart system to keep pace with the 
latest technological advances 
the judge who previously had ordered city officials to award an 
operating license to century federal called for further hearings 
to study franchise fee requirements adopted by the cities 
palo alto and atherton officials said the ruling appears to 
declare unconstitutional a 1984 federal law regulating cable tv 
even though the judge did not say in so many words he was 
invalidating the law 
although lynch purported not to decide the constitutionality 
of any provision of the act his decision in fact holds that 
numerous sections of that statute are unconstitutional lawyers 
for the cities said 
the reagan administration in a friendofthecourt legal 
brief filed by justice department lawyers urged the court to deny 
the cities appeal 
the supreme court in a 1986 ruling that has some bearing on the 
case acted on today raised the possibility that communities may be 
barred from granting exclusive cable tv franchises 
the court said cable franchise activities plainly implicate 
first amendment interests but the justices stopped short of a 
definitive ruling on the constitutional rights of cable operators 
the ruling was in contrast to earlier decisions denying a 
constitutional right to operate overtheair television or radio 
stations 
many cities award exclusive cable franchises citywide or for 
various regions within the city they also impose rules similar to 
those adopted by palo alto and atherton 
the case is palo alto vs century federal 87946

the california secretary of states office is 
threatening to sue the university of southern california to get 
back 1600 cartons of memorabilia left behind by former gov edmund 
g jerry brown jr an official said monday 
brown who served two terms ending in 1982 gave the letters 
memos videotapes pamphlets and personal correspondence to usc 5 
years ago the collection includes about 4 million items 
but secretary of state march fong eu contends his action 
violates a 1975 amendment to the california public records act 
the amendment declares gubernatorial and legislative papers 
public records although uscs chief sacramento lobbyist 
former state controller houston flournoy claims that browns 
papers fall under an exception for personal correspondence and 
memos from the governors legal affairs secretary 
on jan 20 mrs eus office sent a letter to usc threatening to 
sue usc received the letter in early february and a suit will be 
filed within 30 days after that unless the matter is resolved ms 
warren said 
brown has indicated he chose usc as repository for the documents 
after the university of california at berkeley turned them down 
because of lack of space and the state archives balked at the 
former governors insistence that the agency hire former brown aide 
lana beckett to oversee the collection 
usc hired beckett but insists that she won the job in an open 
competition 
mrs eu who as secretary of state also heads the state 
archives argues that the all documents should be in the archives 
browns father edmund g pat brown sr left records from 
his eight years as governor to uc berkeley former gov ronald 
reagan left his papers to the private hoover institution at 
stanford but both those administrations preceded the 1975 law 
assembly gop leader pat nolan has introduced a measure that 
would invalidate the 1975 law the bill passed the assembly last 
year and is now in committee in the senate

the state department said monday it was 
extremely unfortunate that nicaraguan government ceasefire 
negotiators did not respond quickly enough to a new truce proposal 
to prevent the talks from breaking down 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley also welcomed what she said was the 
unconditional acceptance of the proposal by the usbacked contra 
rebels the plan had been outlined by the chief mediator cardinal 
miguel obando y bravo during talks last week in guatemala city 
the positive attitude of the contras further indication of the 
resistances willingness to negotiate in good faith and of their 
desire to achieve a ceasefire mrs oakley said 
she added that the sandinista governments delay in responding 
to the proposal apparantly led to obando y bravos decision to 
break off the talks a day early 
the clerics proposal called for the sandinistas to free all 
political prisoners allow complete freedom of expression and 
resume a dialogue with opposition parties among other measures 
nicaraguas leftist government has said the ceasefire 
discussions should be limited to the technical aspects of achieving 
a truce and that political questions should be dealt with 
separately 
obando y bravos decision to suspend the talks caught the 
sandinista negotiators by surprise they said they had been ready 
to accept his plan in principle and to continue the discussions

a us warship arriving in the persian 
gulf on monday as the newest addition to the navys escort 
squadron fired machinegun warning shots to chase away two fishing 
boats that ventured too close 
although the craft proved to be harmless a us official said 
the boats at first appeared to be boston whalertype vessels often 
used by irans revolutionary guards to attack commercial shipping 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
trenton fired after the boats approached within 3300 yards of a 
us convoy 30 miles off the coast of dubai at about 3 pm 
he said trenton issued two verbal warnings which were not 
heeded and when the boats came within 3000 meters it fired a 
flare and bursts of 50caliber machinegun fire at which time the 
craft stopped and then moved off to the northeast 
a helicopter sent up by the missile frigate john a moore 
accompanying the trenton confirmed through observation that both 
were fishing boats and neither was hit or damaged he added 
while no us warship has been directly attacked by iran 
several have fired warning shots when unidentified small boats 
approached too close or ignored verbal cautions 
in one such incident last year an indian fisherman was killed 
by gunfire from a navy frigate 
american ships also have fired warning shots or come close to 
firing missiles at iraqi warplanes flying too close during attack 
sorties against iranian coastal oil shipping 
a delegation of us officials is visiting baghdad to discuss 
the problem with iraqi military leaders 
the 17000ton trenton sailed through the strait of hormuz hours 
earlier to join the middle east force the navys flotilla in the 
gulf it carried a 400man us marine combat unit and a contingent 
of marine attack helicopters 
us officials said the group was not considered one of the 
navys gulf transits as it did not include any of the kuwaiti 
tankers reflagged by washington last year for protection from 
iranian attack 
the trenton one of the ships involved in a current realignment 
of navy units in the region is a replacement 
when the reshuffling is completed probably within a week it 
will leave the gulfbased force at 16 ships including six mine 
sweepers down one from its maximum strength of 17 
next saturday rear adm anthony a less will take over command 
of the gulf force from rear adm harold j bernsen 
us officials said the marines aboard the trenton would provide 
security for naval operations in the gulf where the 7yearold 
iraqiran war has seriously affected commercial shipping 
irans official news agency said a prototype of the first 
iranianmade airplane made a successful test flight monday and 
would soon go into mass production 
it said the multiplepurpose aircraft can be adapted for 
military use and all parts were made in iran by experts affiliated 
with the revolutionary guards corps each plane will save 
500000 in foreign exchange said the islamic republic news 
agency 
iran also announced that at the orders of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 1139 prisoners have been released as part of an amnesty 
to mark the ninth anniversary of the islamic revolution 
irna said the detainees released in various cities in iran were 
repentant and had been pardoned 
it did not say what they were jailed for or on what day they 
were released 
iran has already reported freeing more than 1000 other 
prisoners following the anniversary of the islamic seizure of power 
on feb 11 1979

the supreme court said monday it will judge 
the validity of a federal law that lets independent counsels 
investigate alleged crimes by highranking executive branch 
officials 
the court also rejected the latest appeal of one target of such 
an investigation marine lt col oliver l north 
the courts decision expected by july will resolve a major 
constitutional dispute and will affect the criminal conviction of 
former white house aide michael k deaver and the rejuvenated 
investigation of exjustice department official theodore b olson 
the decision also could affect other investigations by special 
prosecutors appointed under the law 
the justices allowed special prosecutor alexia morrison to 
resume her investigation of olson raising the possibility that 
grand jury indictments could be handed down before the high courts 
ruling 
a federal appeals court ruled that the watergateera law 
creating independent counsels impermissibly gives presidential 
appointment powers to the federal courts the appeals court had 
derailed morrisons investigation 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals in 
washington ruled by a 21 vote last month that the independent 
counsel provisions of the ethics in government act of 1978 were an 
unconstitutional encroachment of the exclusive power of the 
president to enforce criminal laws 
under the law a special court appoints independent counsels or 
special prosecutors at the request of the attorney general to 
investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing 
morrison is investigating allegations that olson a former 
assistant attorney general lied to congress in 1983 during a 
dispute over the environmental protection agencys cleanup program 
for toxic waste 
the appeals court ruling followed a challenge by olson and 
others to morrisons authority to subpoena their testimony before a 
federal grand jury 
the jan 22 ruling could jeopardize last months perjury 
conviction of former presidential aide michael k deaver for lying 
to a grand jury and to a house subcommittee that investigated his 
lobbying activities 
but the appeals court ruling in olsons case is not expected to 
interfere with the work of lawrence e walsh the independent 
counsel investigating the irancontra arms and money affair 
the supreme court last month refused to consider norths 
challenge to the parallel appointment walsh accepted last year from 
the justice department 
north was fired as a white house aide after his role in the 
diversion of money from secret iranian arms sales to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels was revealed 
a different threejudge panel of the appeals court in washington 
upheld the constitutionality of the backup appointments last year 
independent counsel james c mckay who is prosecuting former 
presidential aide lyn c nofziger on illegal lobbying charges also 
accepted a backup appointment 
but morrison and whitney north seymour the independent counsel 
who prosecuted deaver did not accept backup appointments 
the north appeal acted on monday was from a ruling that barred 
him from halting walshs investigation by challenging its legality 
in a civil lawsuit 
the appeals court ruling that dismissed norths lawsuit said 
potential criminal defendants cannot by bringing ancillary 
equitable proceedings circumvent federal criminal procedure

democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis derided president reagans antiterrorism policies on 
monday as worthless in light of the irancontra affair prompting 
reagans spokesman to retort that candidates shouldnt make a 
hostage situation a political issue 
the massachusetts governor using the white house as a backdrop 
after a meeting of the national governors association with reagan 
issued a stinging critique of the administrations irancontra 
involvement and the problems it might pose for the next president 
asked how he would respond to the latest hostagetaking dukakis 
said you never ever make concessions to terrorism if you ever 
do it then your policy is worthless and thats what we did 
referring to the sale of arms to iran during secret negotiations 
to free american hostages dukakis said well be living with the 
consequences of what happened for a long time 
his remarks came as the administration struggled to deal with 
the kidnapping of another american in lebanon lt col william r 
higgins a marine detailed to a un trucemonitoring force 
queried by reporters dukakis said he would have a much 
tougher and much more consistent antiterrorist policy than 
reagan 
what happened in 1985 was devastating to our ability to be 
credible when it came to putting together a very tough 
nocompromise policy on terrorism he said 
this is international crime pure and simple and you fight it 
the way you fight crime with tough police work with effective 
undercover operations with military operations against terrorist 
base camps if necessary the governor added 
dukakis remarks brought a quick rebuke from presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
i think its very dangerous to make terrorism a political 
issue especially when youre talking about specific episodes 
fitzwater said 
the spokesman asserted that past experience has shown that 
there are any number of aspects to individual hostagetakings 
that can be exacerbated by political talk or media talk or 
political statements 
i would simply urge caution on everyones part including 
political candidates he said 
besides hitting reagans performance on terrorism the 
massachusetts governor took advantage of the attention of the white 
house press corps to question reagans approach to welfare reform 
and child care 
on a strictly political topic he also said he was heading into 
tuesdays south dakota and minnesota contests aiming to prove he 
has wider appeal than shown by his new hampshire primary victory 
if i can do well out there that will be proof positive this 
is a national campaign and a national candidacy he said adding 
that he hoped victories there would be a boost for the multiple 
showdowns march 8 on super tuesday 
dukakis joked that hed used the governors visit to look the 
white house over as a possible residence no commuting dont 
even have to take the street car just walk to work its 
terrific he said with a broad smile 
as dozens of camera and microphonetoting technicians and 
correspondents crowded around him on the white house lawn dukakis 
even offered to meet with the press two or three times a week 
if he were elected 
and to reporters delight he dangled the option of hawaiian 
winter vacations before the ofttraveling pack 
it would be tough to top santa barbara one correspondent 
taunted when the subject came up noting the lush california resort 
town near reagans vacation ranch 
how about cape cod what do you think asked the 
massachusetts governor with a grin 
mild murmurs of approval were made then a query about his 
winter vacation plans 
the berkshires dukakis replied firmly only to be met by 
silence 
sensing a need to offer a new slant on the subject the 
candidate quickly shifted gears 
on the other hand my wife expressed a preference for maui the 
other day he offered 
cheers erupted from the crowd

gov evan mechams criminal trial on 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan was delayed by a 
judge monday until march 22 
the delay from the original march 9 trial date gives both sides 
time to handle pretrial motions and answers said judge michael 
ryan of maricopa county superior court 
mecham also faces a may 17 recall election and a feb 29 
impeachment trial by the state senate 
he is charged with six counts of fraud perjury and filing false 
documents in connection with a 350000 campaign loan made in 
october 1986 by tempe develper and attorney barry wolfson willard 
mecham his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer faces three similar 
counts 
the governor and brother did not answer reporters questions 
when they entered and left the courtroom 
assistant attorney general michael cudahy told ryan he needed 
more time to reply to defense motions cudahy also complained that 
attorneys for the mechams had not yet made required pretrial 
disclosures including lists of witnesses and exhibits 
cudahy said the mechams lawyers made more or less a 
grandstand play by saying in court monday that they were ready to 
go to trial when they had not made the disclosures 
the governors lawyer murray miller said those disclosures 
would be made this week 
ryan said he would schedule a hearing later on several defense 
motions to remand the charges to the state grand jury dismiss some 
of the counts and require grand jurors and the prosecutor to submit 
to questioning 
willard mechams lawyer michael scott has claimed in court 
papers that attorney general bob corbins office manipulated the 
grand jury process by having most testimony presented to a state 
grand jury that met last fall but holding the matter over for a 
new grand jury which indicted the mechams on jan 5 
corbins office has contended however that the matter was 
given to a new grand jury to avoid possible bias because three 
members of the previous grand jury had signed petitions to recall 
mecham 
miller told ryan that he was prepared to have both the criminal 
and impeachment trials simultaneously although he indicated he may 
ask a court to delay the senates impeachment trial however he 
did not say when or where he would file such a motion

a deadly mix of rock and mud 
threatened hillside homes during a fourth day of violent rains 
monday which have killed at least 75 people in the rio area 
the new danger slowed efforts to reach a buried roomful of 
children and prompted the mayor to order hundreds of residents to 
get out while theres still time 
mudcaked survivors flashed thumbsup signs as they were carted 
away on stretchers while rescuers moved gingerly about the 
unstable hillsides in the city 
scores have died there since the heavy rains began triggering 
sporadic floods and mudslides on friday 
civil defense officials warned that huge boulders and 
rainloosened earth on many hillsides presented an extreme risk of 
new avalanches particularly in the crowded shantytown slums that 
line the hills 
mayor roberto saturnino braga went on television to order 
hundreds of slum dwellers to evacuate their highrisk homes 
get out while theres still time you may lose your 
possessions and we regret that but were talking about your 
lives braga said 
in the workingclass north rio district of abolicao rescue 
workers used sledgehammers and spikes to break up concrete slabs of 
a threestory apartment building that collapsed under a mudslide 
sunday night killing at least nine residents 
fourteen people were taken alive from the rubble television 
crews broadcasting live from the site showed survivors covered with 
yellowbrown mud flashing thumbsup signs as they were borne away 
on stretchers 
civil defense spokeswoman sonia hadid said workers expected to 
find as many as 11 bodies under the rubble 
there was a childrens party going on in one of the apartments 
when it collapsed so we dont know how many were in there ms 
hadid said by telephone 
in the santa teresa district near downtown rio 80 firemen 
searched for bodies under the debris of a hillside clinic for the 
elderly that was hit by a mud avalanche late friday a threestory 
pavillion of the clinic collapsed and at least 11 patients died 
rescue efforts were slowed by rain and by a warning from 
engineers that a new mudslide could occur at any moment in santa 
teresa 
they have to work carefully using blowtorches and sledges 
removing the metal concrete and wood when it starts to rain they 
stop otherwise the whole hillside could come down ms hadid 
said 
the spokeswoman said the death toll of 75 included only bodies 
that had reached the morgue and the final total certainly will be 
higher 
the number of dead varied almost daily as civil defense 
authorities struggled to get a clear picture of the tragedys human 
toll 
nearly 9500 were without homes a drop from previous days 
because some flood victims began moving back to their dwellings 
state health officials began a massive vaccination campaign 
against tetanus and leptospirosis a sometimes fatal infection 
caused by water contaminated with rat urine and droppings earlier 
reports indicated erroneously that leprosy was feared 
public service messages on radio and television urged people not 
to walk barefoot through flood water and to boil their drinking 
water or treat it with chlorine 
braga declared a state of public calamity in rio and estimated 
the damage at 150 million 
the weather bureau said the unusually heavy rain was caused by 
an antarctic cold front the forecast was for more rain and gradual 
clearing by wednesday 
earlier this month 207 people died in flooding and mudslides 
around the state and 13000 were left homeless

professional politicians do a better 
job of selecting qualified presidential nominees than the current 
yearlong system of primary elections former sen john tower says 
tower added that televised presidential debates are no better 
than east texas hogcalling contests 
the current system is a very very imperfect way to select a 
national candidate tower said in comments sunday at a convention 
of the national utility contractors association 
in the past he said the smokefilled room screened out the 
candidates who were least competent 
tower a republican said todays system can result in a nominee 
who has the best commercials and who articulates his ideas best 
but who may not be the best president 
he also criticized the news media saying i dont think the 
mass media are capable you dont get a balanced assessment from 
sensational press stories the mass media have become too strong 
on the whole the media are consumed with an arrogance of power

the president of moral majority said monday 
that television evangelist jimmy swaggarts problems will likely 
have a negative impact on the republican presidential campaign of 
former television preacher pat robertson 
jerry c nims president of the conservative lobbying group 
said swaggarts tearful confession and his stepping down from his 
own tv ministry sunday will not affect robertsons core of 
supporters 
however the swaggart controversy might change the minds of 
supporters who had been leaning toward the republican hopeful 
he robertson has a large base of support that wouldnt be 
affected by the fall of a televangelist nims told a news 
conference called by a group of conservative organizations on 
another subject but it might have an impact outside he said 
the moral majority president said robertsons core of followers 
remains strong but he may well lose some of the fringe 
supporters 
nims noted that the minsters who have fallen in the past year 
including jim bakker are members of the charismatic group which 
differs from moral majority and robertson followers 
for much of our constituency it does not have an impact he 
said

rep mario biaggis violation of house ethics 
constituted criminal conduct of a most serious nature going to 
the heart of his representational responsibilities and warranted 
expulsion the house committee on standards of official conduct 
said in a report released monday 
the committee which recommended thursday that biaggi dny 
be expelled from the seat he has held for 20 years explained why 
it had elected to exercise its most serious punishment 
the facts and circumstances giving rise to the violations 
being of the most serious nature warrant the imposition of the 
most stringent sanction available to the house of 
representatives the 148page report said 
accordingly the committee submits that expulsion is the only 
sanction appropriate to the violations committed by representative 
biaggi 
biaggi was not in his office monday but he said thursday that 
he intended to vigorously fight the expulsion recommendation 
biaggi 70 was convicted in september of illegally accepting a 
paid florida vacation from meade esposito the former brooklyn 
ny democratic leader esposito was seeking government help for 
coastal dry dock and repair co a financially troubled brooklyn 
shipyard that owed 280000 in premiums to espositos insurance 
brokerage firm 
biaggi was also convicted of illegally crossing state lines to 
accept the gratuity and obstructing justice by trying to influence 
how esposito answered the fbis questions he was sentenced to 2 
years in prison and a 500000 fine and is free pending appeal 
the ethics committee concluded that biaggi violated rules 
against discrediting the house accepting impermissible gifts from 
a person or organization with a direct or indirect interest in 
legislation failing to report a gift worth 250 or more on his 
financial disclosure form and accepting a favor or benefit that 
might be construed as influencing the performance of government 
duties 
after reviewing evidence from biaggis trial the committee 
found that the offenses for which representative biaggi was 
convicted involved criminal conduct of a most serious nature going 
to the heart of his representational responsibilities 
the committees resolution to expel biaggi must be approved by 
twothirds of the 435member house to take effect the matter may 
be taken up on the floor at any time now that the committee report 
has been released 
if the resolution passes biaggi would be the second congressman 
expelled from the house since the civil war rep michael ozzie 
myers dpa was ousted in 1980 after his conviction in the abscam 
bribery scheme 
the committee report also includes a transcript of its closed 
dec 17 1987 meeting at which biaggi pleaded for leniency and 
declared i am incorruptible 
biaggi argued that the vacation he took at a florida health 
spa was hospitality from esposito a friend of 40 years not a 
gratuity 
placing the value of the vacation at about 3000 biaggi asked 
rhetorically mario biaggi is going to compromise himself for 
3000 i wouldnt compromise myself for 100000 
biaggi also said he did not know that esposito had business with 
coastal until a bugged telephone conversation on june 2 1986 more 
than a year after the florida vacation

at full strength with the addition of justice 
anthony m kennedy the supreme court said monday it wants to hear 
a second round of arguments in two cases already under study 
the unusual move having lawyers twice argue a case before the 
justices during one court term could mean that kennedys 
tiebreaking vote is needed to resolve the two cases 
at issue in one is whether defense contractors may be forced to 
pay damages for onduty accidents involving members of the military 
the court is deciding whether to reinstate a 725000 award to 
the family of a marine helicopter copilot who died in a 1980 crash 
in the atlantic ocean near virginia beach va 
a jury awarded the damages to the family of david boyle who 
drowned on april 27 1983 in the crash of the ch53 helicopter 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals threw out the award 
against the helicopter manufacturer sikorsky aircraft and its 
parent company united technologies corp 
the appeals court said sikorsky as a military contractor was 
shielded from being sued because the navy approved of the 
helicopters allegedly negligent design the justices heard 
arguments in the case jan 12 
the second case which the court first heard jan 19 and will be 
reargued sometime in april involves the convicted killer of an 
oklahoma policeman 
prosecutors say bobby lynn ross shot elk city okla police 
sgt steve mahan three times after the officer arrived at a motel 
being robbed by ross on jan 5 1983 
at issue is whether ross trial was tainted when the presiding 
judge refused to disqualify for cause a potential juror who 
said he would vote to impose the death penalty and would not even 
consider a life sentence if ross were convicted 
the potential juror was excluded when ross lawyer used one of 
nine peremptory challenges ross contends his defense team 
should not have been forced to expend one such challenge for that 
juror 
both cases are to be decided by july 
the court monday refused to reconsider its 44 decision last 
december striking down an illinois law that could have made 
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the justices rejected a request by illinois attorney general 
neil f hartigan that they restudy the law after the appointment 
of a ninth justice 
kennedy joined the court last thursday filling an eightmonth 
vacancy but he did not participate in mondays order denying 
reconsideration in the illinois case 
he did join in the orders requiring reargument in the two other 
cases 
in seeking reconsideration hartigan emphasized the importance 
of a decision by a full court in the case 
the illinois law required girls under 18 and still financially 
dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours before 
having an abortion 
the law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if she 
could prove to a state judge that she was mature enough and 
wellinformed enough to make the decision on her own and that 
notifying her parents would not be in her best interest 
doctors who failed to comply with the laws requirement faced 
criminal prosecution

a teenage boy whose father hired a hit man 
through soldier of fortune magazine to kill his mother fought back 
tears monday as he testified he feared a similar fate 
gary wayne black 18 took the stand in the second week of a 
federal court trial of a lawsuit filed by him and his maternal 
grandmother marjorie einmann 
they are seeking 225 million from the boulder colobased 
magazine accusing the selfproclaimed journal for professional 
adventurers of negligence for running an ad that led to the 
slaying of sandra black 
the ad placed by john wayne hearn brought him into contact 
with robert black 
black is on texas death row for paying hearn 10000 to carry 
out the killing of his wife hearn is serving three life terms in 
florida for that and two other slayings 
gary black a high school senior who found his mother shot to 
death in their bryan home three years ago sunday described her as 
understanding and kind 
she just was the worst person i could lose he said 
mrs einmann who also testified monday as plaintiffs completed 
their case against the magazine said her grandson was so 
devastated by the killing he not sleep alone or enter his house 
alone for a year and a half afterward 
he constantly twitched and suffered from severe headaches she 
said 
during treatment by state mental health counselors the boy told 
how much he feared his father she said 
they said his mind was so damaged he feared if someone 
could get into his own home to kill his own mother someone could 
get into my house to kill him 
if he could hire someone out of soldier of fortune magazine to 
kill my mother he could hire someone out of soldier of fortune 
magazine to kill me too gary black said of his father 
hearns ad appeared in four issues of the magazine in late 1984 
offering services of former marine and vietnam veterans and weapons 
specialists with jungle warfare expertise for highrisk 
assignments in the united states or overseas 
a criminologist park dietz testified last week the reference 
to highrisk meant the person placing the ad was willing to 
commit a crime 
attorneys for the magazine do not deny the ad brought hearn and 
black together but insist publisher robert brown had no way of 
knowing the ad was for illegal activity 
brown has testified he would have halted the classified ads for 
personal services if he had known they were linked to crimes 
defense attorneys planned to call several witnesses to testify 
for the magazines value as a defense journal 
among them would be col charles beckwith who led the armys 
delta force in the unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to rescue the 
american hostages in iran

navy secretary james h webb resigned today 
saying he is unable to support defense secretary frank 
carluccis decision to abandon the goal of a 600ship fleet and 
criticizing carluccis leadership in the pentagon 
this building needs to be led webb told reporters it 
needs leadership it needs some vision im saying that if i had a 
piece of advice to give to secretary carlucci it would be to spend 
a lot more time with the top leaders in this building 
hes been spending a lot of time with the state department and 
a lot of time on the hill i think they pentagon leaders need to 
feel his vision and to understand what he believes in 
webb 42 has held the job less than a year a highlydecorated 
marine veteran of vietnam combat he was the author of fields of 
fire a bestselling novel about the war in vietnam 
in his letter of resignation to president reagan webb said he 
decided to leave because he could not support the fiscal 1989 
pentagon budget proposal crafted by carlucci 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said secretary 
carlucci is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the 
pentagon to accommodate budgetary reductions secretary webb 
indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints but i 
know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the 
country and will work with secretary carlucci to find a 
replacement as soon as possible 
referring to the internal budget debate that led to last weeks 
submission of the fiscal 1989 budget webb wrote to reagan 
on three separate occasions the uniformed and civilian 
leadership of the navy department provided the secretary of defense 
with proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budget 
reduction but which also would preserve the cherished goal of your 
administration to rebuild our navy to a minimum of 600 ships 
because those recommendations were rejected by your secretary 
of defense i am unable to support him personally or to defend this 
amended budget during budget deliberations on capitol hill 
webb concluded 
consequently i find it necessary to resign from my position 
as secretary of the navy 
this budget cutting is not being done according to a 
strategy webb told reporters in his pentagon office 
webb who assumed the post as the navys top civilian leader 
just april 10 said his concerns focused on a decision by carlucci 
to propose the early retirement and mothballing of 16 navy frigates 
the navy had to cut 12 billion from its original fiscal 1989 
budget plan but still could have kept those ships by assigning 
them to the naval reserve instead of consigning them to mothballs 
webb continued 
without those frigates webb said there was no way the navy 
could build to 600 warships in fiscal 1989 as originally planned 
indeed despite the optimistic predictions of other pentagon 
officials the decision means the navy will never reach the 
600ship mark he added 
and one of the sad things about this this was one of the few 
goals of the reagan administration that was really obtainable at 
pretty low cost webb added 
webb one of the youngest men to ever become navy secretary is 
a naval academy graduate 
he came to the pentagon in 1984 when caspar w weinberger was 
the defense secretary assuming the post of assistant defense 
secretary for reserve affairs webb had resigned that position and 
was preparing to leave government service in early 1987 when the 
president asked him to replace john f lehman the first navy 
secretary of the reagan administration 
in his meeting with reporters webb declined to speculate on why 
carlucci had insisted that ships be retired when that step in 
webbs view wasnt required 
pentagon leaders should always be concerned about hollow 
forces that arent properly manned but the navy could have 
reached the 600ship mark without giving up readiness webb 
insisted 
the navy secretary said he had wrestled with his concerns for 
some time but didnt make a final decision to resign until sunday 
webb said he had not spoken to carlucci today but had sent him 
a copy of his letter to reagan 
carlucci in a written personal statement said today he had 
learned of webbs decision with regret 
i wish him well in his future endeavors carlucci said he 
has earned our respect and gratitude for his service to our nation 
both in uniform and as a civilian leader within the defense 
department 
the pentagon in a companion statement said the recent budget 
debate has been one of the most painful in history 
the compromises have not been easy for anyone and we regret 
the fact that the secretary of the navy appears to have found 
himself unable to defend the departments decisions under the 
circumstances he has done the honorable thing

the 70yearold reputed underboss of the gambino 
crime family was sentenced monday to 15 years in prison and fined 
820000 for a racketeering conviction 
joseph armone of brooklyn was convicted dec 22 of 
racketeering conspiracy involving extortion bribery and illegal 
interstate travel to commit bribery 
us district judge jack b weinstein said he sentenced armone 
to prison despite his advanced age because he was convinced armone 
was a highranking member of the crime family 
weinstein also cited armones lengthy criminal record which he 
said began when the defendant was 15 years old 
armone had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for the most 
serious charge racketeering 
according to the prosecution armone was elevated from capo to 
underboss after he was indicted in 1986 it was also alleged that 
armone was observed meeting with reputed gambino boss john gotti 
during the trial 
armone was jailed at the time of his conviction after he refused 
to renounce any organized crime ties as a condition for his release 
from detention on monday armone made a brief statement to 
weinstein in which he said he had not meant any disrespect to the 
court in refusing the offer but that he turned it down because he 
was worried about his rights 
prior to sentencing defense attorney mark krasnow said armone 
had paid his dues to society for his previous convictions and 
charged that his client had been entrapped by the government 
prosecutor douglas grover a special attorney with the justice 
departments organized crime strike force said armone had been 
convicted of serious and compelling crimes and of being a 
leader in the gambino family his life grover said 
one of the bribery charges accused armone and one of his 
codefendants joseph n gallo of unsuccessfully plotting to give 
a 20000 bribe so that gallos son would be transferred from a 
state prison where he was then being held to a federal prison 
where presumably he would receive better treatment

the former parish priest of an 
irish nationalist who was shot dead from a british army observation 
tower said monday the victim was harassed by police and soldiers 
for at least five years 
the rev brendan mchugh said aidan mcanespie 23 had to cross 
into the irish republic every day to his job and was harassed 
constantly at the army checkpoint 
we complained time out of number to the police and military 
but no action was ever taken life for the poor man had just become 
unbearable mchugh told reporters 
the army said it deeply regrets the shooting sunday a 
spokesman said mcanespie was hit by a bullet fired from an 
observation post about half a mile from the frontier in county 
tyrone 
police said the soldier involved was in military custody and an 
investigation was being conducted the soldier was not identified 
and police would not comment on the priests allegations 
relatives said mcanespie was walking to a regular weekly gaelic 
football game in aughnacloy the county tyrone village where he 
lives 
francis molloy a local councilman said mcanespie was an 
election worker for sinn fein legal political arm of the outlawed 
irish republican army the ira denied he was among its members and 
mchugh the priest said he was not involved in paramilitary 
activity 
he was never abused physically just verbally and his car was 
often taken apart he said i dont know why he was singled out 
for such treatment 
the campaign against him must have been going on for at least 
five years other young lads were also stopped but aidan appeared 
to be getting special treatment 
shootings of civilians by security forces have become rare 
compared with the early 1970s when protestantcatholic strife in 
the british province was at its height 
mcanespies death came at a time of severe strain in angloirish 
relations over other incidents involving police and the provinces 
roman catholic minority the government in dublin demanded a speedy 
report 
britain provoked irish outrage last month by saying it would not 
prosecute policemen accused of perverting justice in the aftermath 
of the killings of six unarmed catholics in three incidents in late 
1982 
the strain was compounded by a british appeals courts refusal 
to overturn the conviction of six irishmen for two bombings that 
killed 21 people in 1974 irish officials believe the six are 
victims of a miscarriage of justice

a federal judge monday dismissed 
drugrelated charges against a woman whose boyfriend fell to his 
death from a plane in 1985 with 77 pounds of cocaine and a 
defective parachute strapped to his body 
us district judge james h jarvis dropped the counts at the 
request of assistant us attorney james r dedrick who last week 
lost a bid to use statements mad by rebecca sharp to undercover 
agents as evidence against her 
ms sharp 32 a paralegal in lexington ky had been set to go 
on trial march 1 on charges of conspiring with her boyfriend 
former lexington narcotics officer andrew thornton ii to import 
cocaine and of distributing the drug 
under the terms of the dismissal dedrick can seek another 
indictment against ms sharp meanwhile her attorney said ms 
sharp was pleased at the movie and hopeful the case was over 
thorntons body was found on a knoxville driveway sept 11 
1985 bags of cocaine were tied to his waist and federal 
authorities have linked him to about 200 pounds of the drug found 
in duffel bags scattered across northern georgia for apparent later 
retrieval the empty plane was found crashed 
a few days later drug enforcement agency special agent kieran 
kobell posing as an associate or representative of the 
colombians who supposedly provided thornton the cocaine went to 
lexington with a government informant bertram gordon 
kobel said the two met with ms sharp and she revealed an 
intimate knowledge of the cocaine smuggling operation 
dedricks motion did not specify why he wanted the charges 
dismissed but it seems likely the suppression of ms sharps 
statements was a direct cause 
us magistrate robert p murrian ruled feb 12 that those 
statements were made in fear 
kobell was playing the part of a colombian or representative 
of a colombian or colombians who had lost 12000000 worth of 
cocaine he wrote in upholding the motion to keep ms sharps 
statements out of evidence 
i believe that under the circumstances of this case the 
defendant ms sharp had to have been in great personal fear for 
her safety when she made the statements murrian wrote it 
would have been smart from her point of view to promise that the 
deal would go through that the colombians would not be ripped 
off and that she would kill if necessary to see that happen 
murrian also said kobell threatened both ms sharp and fred 
partin her attorney in kentucky according to partins testimony 
at the suppression hearing partin is a former assistant us 
attorney 
kobell has denied threatening ms sharp

we need money from both government and private sources said 
edward connor a member of the academy of pediatrics 
conner noted that about 80 percent of the known 839 cases of

if we could reach these prospective parents today we could 
stop this expanding problem in nine months he said at a press

to pay for the kind of facetoface contact that is required to 
reach them 
rather than focus on a particular goal representatives of the 
nine organizations said they would engage in a generic effort 
to make sure children are not forgotten as programs to combat aids 
are formulated and implemented

democrat albert gore jr won the support 
monday of sen howell heflin a southern conservative who said he 
wanted to educate the presidential candidate to more 
conservative or moderate views 
hes not too far to the left but ive got to try to bring him 
to the middle a little bit said heflin of alabama im going 
to work on him 
heflin appeared with his senate colleague from neighboring 
tennessee at a news conference scheduled by the gore campaign to 
trumpet what they regarded as an endorsement by an influential and 
respected southern conservative lawmaker 
gore also used the news conference to renew attacks on 
democratic rivals richard gephardt a missouri congressman for 
inconsistency and massachusetts gov michael dukakis for foreign 
policy inexperience 
heflins remarks however highlighted the difference between 
the alabama senators conservative voting record in congress and 
that of gore gore has positioned himself to the right of his 
rivals on defense and foreign policy issues but has a voting 
record that critics say is more liberal than his rhetoric suggests 
heflin said gore has common sense and a downhome centralist 
philosophy 
but he acknowledged gore was to the left of himself when he was 
asked about how they have differed on such issues as military aid 
to the nicaraguan contras and money for president reagans nuclear 
defense shield program 
i have a hope that i can educate him a little bit and bring 
him over a little bit more heflin said 
gore opposes military aid to the contras while saying he would 
support some humanitarian aid and has opposed money for star wars 
although he has said he would support some research consistent with 
existing treaties 
gore had a rating of 70 in 1986 from the liberal americans for 
democratic action meaning his votes on selected issues agreed with 
that groups position 70 percent of the time he had a rating of 9 
from the conservative american conservative union heflin by 
contrast had ratings of 25 from the ada and 65 from the acu 
heflin said he regarded gore as the most electable of the 
democratic candidates and strong on national defense 
al gore is the only democratic candidate in this race who can 
carry the south in november he said 
his roots run deep in southern soil and he has never 
forgotten rural america from whence he came heflin said 
gore renewed the criticism of his rivals accusing dukakis of 
suggesting it was fine with him if the soviet union established a 
client state in central america so long as they did not put soviet 
offensive weapons in that client state dukakis has sharply 
denied making such a statement 
it is another example of his total lack of experience in 
foreign policy gore said 
gore repeated criticism of gephardt for changing positions on 
issues such as abortion the minimum wage and taxes but gore 
acknowledged he had voted in 1984 for legislation that had 
mandatory production control provisions similar to the farm 
proposals gephardt now backs and gore denounces as disastrous for 
the economy 
there is a difference between changing your mind on one or two 
issues over a 12year period and having a wholesale change in 
dozens and dozens of key positions he said referring to 
gephardt 
he also said gephardts whole approach to the electorate is in 
contrast to the approach during his career in the congress 
gore also campaigned in maryland one of the 20 states holding 
democratic primaries or caucuses march 8 where he said stopping 
the flow of illegal drugs into the country would be a top priority 
for his administration he stopped at the coast guards curtis bay 
shipyard which the reagan administration has scheduled to close 
and which he pledged to keep open

this seaside town is girding for 
another successful spring break while former mecca fort lauderdale 
faces defections to exotic resorts and uncertainty at home over 
whether it should keep encouraging college students 
the 1960 film where the boys are established fort lauderdale 
as the nations spring break center but daytona beach has taken 
the lead in florida recently 
daytona beach will play host this year to about 500000 young 
vacationers between feb 28 and april 1 while fort lauderdale may 
be lucky to attract the 200000 that came last year officials say 
not all of the defectors are going to daytona beach 
in recent years the bahamas floridas panhandle texas south 
padre island and the mexican resorts in cancun and acapulco have 
cultivated the freespending students 
i doubt if i have 100 reservations to fort lauderdale but 
probably 8000 for cancun rob brown president of travel turf 
tours in bethlehem pa told the wall street journal last week 
theres some talk about how mexicos coming into prominence 
florida tourism division spokesman raul marcucci said monday it 
started happening last year 
but with 16000 hotel rooms along 23 miles of beach daytona 
beach is expecting a strong turnout 
we know that on an average each student visiting daytona 
beach spends between 325 and 400 here said evelyn fine 
executive director of the midflorida research and business center 
of daytona beach community college assuming each dollar is spent 
seven times in the local economy my guess is were looking at 
about 130 million this year 
mtv and national college television networks will broadcast live 
from daytona beach over the peak march 20 weekend 
two breweries are sponsoring free concerts a soft drink maker 
is sending a portable dance club to motel parking lots and 
countless other national distributors will promote everything from 
suntan lotion to peppermint schnapps including tennis shoes and 
doityourself pregnancy tests 
tour promoters say daytona beach has become the spring break 
mecca partly because fort lauderdale officials weary of the 
trouble that came with the collegians have been cracking down 
in the past five years ive seen a gradual increase to 
daytona just because of the strictness of the enforcement in 
lauderdale said ron good president of campus marketing inc in 
glen ellyn ill you can really kind of let loose in daytona 
its a little bit wilder 
daytona beach police jailed 270 people when an allnight 
rockthrowing melee broke out on the strip in 1975 but fort 
lauderdale ran into even more trouble a crackdown two years ago 
resulted in 2500 arrests 
across florida state officials this year are urging bar owners 
to obey the law on the drinking age of 21 
the division of alcoholic beverages and tobacco is presenting 
workshops in traditional spring break cities to educate bar owners 
and employees about floridas drinking laws 
meanwhile for sale signs have been sprouting in fort 
lauderdale 
last year was a devastating year for a lot of the small 
hotels and some of these momandpop hotels already are being 
listed for sale said real estate broker max sebastiani 
while city officials emphasize family vacations some merchants 
are still rooting for the college students 
theres only a small group that doesnt want the college 
students said crazy gregg newell former bar owner and 
director of the fort lauderdale 88 committee promoting spring 
break and they dont seem to be directly involved with beach

bob doles presidential campaign manager said 
monday the kansas senator intends to take the offensive on the 
issue of taxes and may start pointing out how many times george 
bush has changed his position on the subject 
former sen bill brock also accused the vice presidents 
campaign of deliberate distortions of doles position that were 
demeaning to the political process 
brock made his comments as aides said the campaign had hired new 
producers for its television advertisements in the wake of doles 
defeat by bush in last weeks new hampshire primary 
officials said michael murphy and alex castellanos who produced 
a biographical videotape used late last year to introduce dole to 
the voters would be joining the campaign they will replace don 
ringe 
dole was seen as damaged in new hampshire by bushs charge that 
he couldnt be relied on to block tax increases but brock said the 
vice president really distorted the record he said dole has said 
he would veto any attempt to increase income tax rates but was not 
averse to closing certain loopholes that allow corporations to 
reduce their tax bills 
he said it was time to start pointing out how many times 
george bush has changed his position on taxes back in october he 
said he was against any tax increase a few days later he came out 
and said well maybe in november again he said well i really dont 
want to and then four days after that he said maybe well have to 
i dont think were going to be on the defensive on this one 
i think were going to be on the offensive he said

scandals surrounding two of the most 
prominent ministers of the assemblies of god may have created a 
false impression that the church is riddled with discipline 
problems an official said monday 
the evangelical church which counts more than 16 million 
adherents worldwide and operates four colleges in springfield is 
investigating the misconduct of louisiana evangelist jimmy 
swaggart officials say swaggart has revealed an undisclosed 
transgression on sunday he tearfully stepped down from his 
television pulpit 
another prominent television evangelist the ptls jimmy bakker 
lost his assemblies of god credentials last year amid charges of 
sexual misconduct swaggart was said to have been active in 
uncovering that scandal and bakker accused him of plotting to take 
over ptl 
those are the only two in our whole denomination that have that 
kind of recognition said church spokeswoman juleen turnage so 
people may feel that this is indicative of the assemblies of god 
denomination and that is not true 
we have over 30000 credentialed ministers in the assemblies 
of god in the united states at any given time any given year 
fewer than onehalf of 1 percent are ever called into discipline 
 
mrs turnage said 12 areas of misconduct ranging from doctrinal 
aberrations to moral failure call for disciplinary action 
mrs turnage said that according to bylaws the churchs 
louisiana district has six months to complete its investigation of 
swaggart though it is not expected to take that long 
now that he has confessed to the sin it will be a matter of 
the district meeting and forwarding a report and its 
reccommendation to the executive presbytery here in springfield 
mrs turnage said 
swaggart could be suspended or dismissed as an assemblies 
minister in either case he would have the option of entering a 
rehabilitation program that would take at least two years turnage 
said 
swaggart appeared before his congregation in baton rouge la 
sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act he 
did not describe publicly he said he would not return to his 
pulpit until the church investigation was completed

a contingency plan to help prevent an 
uncontrolled meltdown of the financial markets won the endorsement 
monday of the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
and three other representatives 
our markets remain vibrant but they are at the same time 
delicate rep john dingell dmich wrote in a letter to the 
heads of three regulatory agencies to permit them to function 
without such a contingency plan courts unnecessary risk 
the letter was also signed by reps edward markey dmass 
chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
norman lent rny ranking minority member on the energy and 
commerce committee and matthew rinaldo rnj ranking minority 
member of the finance subcommittee 
the letter to the securities and exchange commission commodity 
futures trading commission and federal reserve board was prompted 
by the oct 19 stock crash 
the market decline was a wrenching and sobering experience 
for the marketplace market participants regulators and those of 
us in congress with oversight responsibilities for our securities 
markets the letter said 
it noted a recommendation by the general accounting office 
congress research arm that regulators prepare a plan for dealing 
with any similar emergency in the future 
we believe that his recommendation should be implemented 
as a concrete first step toward increased coordination among the 
markets and restoration of investor confidence the letter said 
the congressmen asked the regulators to report to congress by 
march 25 on their efforts to craft a plan for coordinating 
decisions by regulators and communicating them to the markets 
they also asked the agencies to determine how much authority 
the marketplaces should have to act independently of the regulators 
in crisis circumstances 
the letter urged the agencies to agree on circumstances that 
would allow relaxed interpretation of rules to facilitate market 
liquidity such as the interpretation of rules associated with 
corporate stock repurchase plans and on the provision of funds 
to the economy by the federal reserve during times of market 
turmoil 
congress meanwhile has been considering longterm measures to 
ensure greater market coordination ranging from a partial merger 
of the sec and cftc to the creation of a new oversight body

a former top aide to panamanas strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega met under heavy guard monday at the us 
courthouse with prosecutors investigating the irancontra affair 
jose i blandon presumably was questioned by the staff of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh about noriegas agreement to 
train nicaraguan rebels at the request of lt col oliver north a 
former national security council official who is a target of 
walshs investigation 
blandon a former panamanian intelligence official was escorted 
by heavily armed us marshals as he arrived at the courthouse for 
his 2hour meeting with members of walshs staff 
a former top intelligence official in the panamanian government 
blandon was a key informant for federal prosecutors in florida who 
earlier this month obtained indictments charging noriega with 
taking at least 46 million in bribes to protect a major colombian 
drug ring 
he is now in the protective custody of us marshals 
blandon recently told the senate foreign relations committee 
that noriega agreed to provide training for nicaraguan 
antisandinista rebels after recieving a request from north in 1985 
north sought the training on panamanian soil because congress 
had banned direct us military aide to the rebels blandon said 
blandon who was fired last month as panamas consul general in 
new york told congressional hearings earlier this month that north 
met with noriega on a yacht in june 1985 near the panamanian city 
of balboa the two met again four months later in noriegas office 
blandon said 
during one of the meetings noriega offered to send panamanian 
soldiers to nicaragua on terrorist sabotage missions but north 
said he had no authority to accept such an offer blandon said 
north said however he would relay noriegas offer to his 
superiors at the national security council blandon testified 
blandon said noriega also met in december 1985 with rear adm 
john m poindexter who had just been appointed national security 
adviser 
poindexter who is also a target of walshs investigation 
resigned nov 24 1986 following revelations that proceeds of us 
arms sales to iran had been diverted to help buy arms for the 
contras 
north was fired the same day that poindexter submitted his 
resignation to president reagan 
in his testimony to the senate foreign relations committee 
blandon said noriega headed a criminal empire that sold drugs 
with the knowledge of us officials 
blandon also said one of noriegas pilots flew a cargo of 
cocaine to a ranch in costa rica owned by an american supporter of 
the contras 
noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in miami and tampa 
earlier this month on charges that he accepted at least 46 
million in payoffs from colombias medellin drug cartel said to 
supply 80 percent of the cocaine shipped to this country 
the indictments charge that noriega accepted the payoffs in 
return for laundering drug money providing protection for cocaine 
shipments and a haven for drug dealers noriega has strongly denied 
any wrongdoing

state and local government workers received 
annual pay raises last year averaging 49 percent under collective 
bargaining contracts with public employee unions the labor 
department said monday 
the pay increases were below the average 57 percent raises 
received by state and local government employees in 1986 but the 
workers still fared better last year than federal employees who got 
a 3 percent pay increase and private sector workers whose wages 
rose an average 33 percent 
however the bureau of labor statistics noted that union 
contracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly 
state and local governments for example tend to have a higher 
proportion of professional and whitecollar workers union 
contracts in the private sector on the other hand often include 
lumpsum bonuses and costofliving adjustments excluded from the 
wage calculations and usually absent in the public sector 
the figures showed that local government workers with wage 
increases averaging 53 percent outpaced state employees workers 
with an average 43 percent raise 
among occupation groups primary and secondary school teachers 
got the biggest raises at 63 percent followed by transit and 
other transportation workers at 48 percent

president reagan cautioned the nations 
governors monday against pressing for costly federal solutions to 
the problems of welfare and child care 
his remarks to the national governors association were labeled 
a disappointment by massachusetts gov michael dukakis a 
democratic presidential hopeful who said reagan should be backing 
the governors bipartisan welfare reform bill in the senate 
reagan instead said he still strongly supports a less costly 
republican alternative that the house rejected two months ago 
he also cautioned the governors to go slow on the issue of child 
care where both democrats and republicans in congress are 
proposing to expand federal support and subsidies for working 
parents 
maybe its my conservative bent but i cant help but feel 
uneasy sometimes he told the governors gathered in the east room 
of the white house 
welfare programs have become a crippling poverty trap 
they keep the poor poor reagan said now much of the push for 
child care is designed to rectify the ills of earlier programs and 
many of these efforts are timely and good but in this area more 
than any other government should tread carefully 
reagan said the alternative bill sponsored by house minority 
leader robert michel rill would also give states freedom to 
develop your own ideas on child care 
afterwards dukakis told reporters that he was very disappointed 
just one word from the president i think would get this bill 
passed and done before the election and get it off the table as a 
partisan issue and get going said dukakis 
he keeps telling us stories about california and were trying 
to explain to him that the vast majority of people on welfare these 
days are single mothers with young children and its a combination 
of real training for real jobs combined with day care that makes 
a difference said dukakis 
howard baker reagans chief of staff said reagan would veto 
the housepassed welfare reform bill but might approve a less 
expensive measure still being shaped by the senate finance 
committee 
the governors are pushing sen daniel patrick moynihans bill 
which would toughen enforcement of child support help states pay 
for job training and make participation mandatory for most 
unemployed adults it would also provide some transitional medicaid 
and welfare benefits for families exiting the relief rolls for work 
moynihan a new york democrat has 56 cosponsors for his bill 
which would cost 23 billion over five years compared to the 43 
billion house bill which would raise benefits and prohibit states 
from denying welfare to families with both parents in the home 
baker said the moynihan bill is not yet satisfactory but he 
held out the hope that moynihan and sen john heinz rpa might 
be able to fashion a compromise satisfactory to reagan 
heinz like moynihan a member of the senate finance committee 
has not introduced an alternative bill 
moynihan said in a telephone interview he heard two messages 
from reagan one says that were going to veto the house bill 
the other says we can try to work something out i choose to 
respond to the second message theres too much at stake here if 
the president is interested in the subject ill be happy to work 
with sen heinz on anything 
rep tom downey dny who spearheaded passage of the house 
bill said in an interview the time to do something about 
welfare is now and the only person who seems opposed to it or 
looking at the past is the president were not going to end child 
poverty by leaving it to the states to do it they dont have the 
money 
illinois gov james thompson a republican told reporters i 
think theres just a fundamental disagreement about how far to go 
on welfare reform especially with regard to cost the governors 
changed their mind not the president but despite that sticking 
point thompson said i still hold out hope that between the 
administration and the senate well get a bill 
arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat who is leading the 
governors push for welfare reform emerged from the meeting and 
said he felt reagan was open to compromise 
i am encouraged because basically their negotiating strategy 
with everybody always is to take the hardest possible line and then 
come off of it at the end clinton said 
in the private meeting that followed reagans speech clinton 
said i told him we thought his bill was not a good bill and that 
we were willing to make some changes in what came out of the house 
but we werent going to get anywhere if his emissary kept saying 
well were going to veto whatever passes that we dont like 
clinton said reagan replied that he heard us and was 
willing to work with us so i think thats good 
alabama gov guy hunt a republican said he shared reagans 
misgivings about the housepassed welfare bill he said it might 
really compound the problem by increasing federal funding without 
giving states more control over welfare rules 
what the states need is flexibility to allow them to gradually 
remove people from welfare instead of terminating their 
benefits as soon as they get a job hunt said 
later the governors committee on human resources heard 
televisions captain kangaroo bob keeshan plead for corporations 
to start providing quality day care im almost ashamed at times 
to be an american the childrens performer and advocate said 
we are half a century behind in addressing day care we are going 
to pay an enormous price a quartercentury down the line

sen sam nunn said monday the new ussoviet 
nuclear arms control treaty wont be ratified until after his armed 
services committee the panel finishes its linebyline examination 
of the pact 
that laborious process began monday after the state department 
sent the senate 31 volumes of documents involved in the long 
negotiations which led to the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
inf pact 
it is very regrettable that we have to go through this said 
the georgia democrat who emerged victorious in a fight with the 
reagan administration over the legal meaning of treaties 
nunn chairman of the armed services panel said he didnt know 
how long it would take the committee to finish its work 
the panel is one of three senate committees considering the 
treaty which was signed in december by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev ratification by the full senate which 
requires a twothirds vote is expected later 
the inf fight was based on a previous dispute between the 
democraticcontrolled congress and the reagan administration over 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and reagans star wars 
antimissile program 
a number of star wars tests would be banned unless the united 
states moved from the current narrow interpretation of the abm 
treaty to a broad view 
the reagan administration had asserted it wasnt bound by what 
previous administrations told congress about the meaning of the abm 
pact a view the white house at one point tried to push in the 
senate debate over the inf treaty 
nunn threatened to block the treaty until secretary of state 
george p shultz promised last month that administration comments 
on the treaty were authoritative meaning that future 
administrations couldnt try to change how the treaty is viewed 
since shultzs promise was delivered we can now proceed 
confident that the treaty the committee is being asked to approve 
is the same treaty the administration believes it negotiated 
nunn told maynard glitman one of the chief negotiators for the 
us team which worked out the treaty during a committee meeting 
monday 
the committee has sent the state department a list of 135 
questions about possible ambiguities in the treaty nunn said most 
are technical questions but some involve queries about possible 
interpretation of the pact which bans missiles with ranges from 
300 miles to 3400 miles 
sen john glenn dohio told glitman im sorry there was a 
reinterpretation of the abm treaty that made this necessary 
its sad we have to go through the exercise were going 
through here said sen james exon dneb 
while the armed services panel was going through a detailed 
scrutiny of the pact the senate foreign relations committee 
continued taking testimony from public witnesses 
dr edward teller the physicist who is considered the father of 
both the hydrogen bomb and reagans star wars program told the 
foreign relations panel he thought the fights over the meanings of 
treaties were senseless debates 
teller said he supports the treaty although he is deeply 
distrustful of the soviet union 
speaking of the treaty he said my personal approach is 
careful doubtful yet positive he said

cyprus greek and turkish leaders sparred 
monday only a day after elections with the turkish head proposing 
talks in neutral territory and the greek presidentelect insisting 
they be held on his own turf 
the dispute over a matter of protocol disappointed some who had 
for a new start in talks to reunify cyprus in a federation 
the sparring began when turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash 
invited greek cypriot presidentelect george vassiliou to informal 
talks on the future of the island to be held in a neutral area 
vassiliou countered with an invitation to denktash to come and 
see me at the presidential palace 
i am the elected president of the cyprus republic and in that 
capacity i would be most happy to welcome mr denktash as the 
leader of the turkish cypriot community vassiliou said in a 
radio interview 
denktash is president of the breakaway turkish republic of 
northern cyprus which was proclaimed in 1983 and is 
internationally recognized only by turkey he does not recognize 
vassiliou who will be sworn in next sunday as president of all 
cyprus 
vassiliou a millionaire businessman backed by the communist 
party defeated veteran rightwing politician glafcos clerides in 
general elections sunday only greek cypriots voted 
an official announcement said president reagan sent vassiliou a 
message of congratulations expressing the wish to continue 
relations with cyprus 
i look forward through you to continuing the friendly 
relations between our two countries a relationship which has been 
characterized by a special warmth and a constant effort to build 
mutual respect and understanding reagans message said 
i know that you have the determination to make the effort to 
bring about the lasting peace which has so long escaped the people 
of cyprus the message said 
vassiliou said he will thank reagan in a message expressing hope 
the united states will more actively to persuade turkey to withdraw 
its troops 
denktash proposed in his invitation to vassiliou that the talks 
be held at the ledra palace hotel a un headquarters on the green 
line dividing turkish and greek cypriots he said the meeting 
would be between the leaders of the two politically equal parties 
or between the presidents of two equal political entities 
vassiliou had said during his campaign that he was willing to 
meet with the turkish cypriots without preconditions 
but his counteroffer to meet denktash at the presidential 
palace in the greek cypriotcontrolled zone citing his own role as 
president of cyprus and denktash only as leader of the turkish 
cypriot community was certain to be rebuffed 
in the interview with the british broadcasting corp vassiliou 
indicated no new flexibility in the conflict between greek and 
turkish cypriots 
he accused turkey of building up its military presence in the 
turkish cypriot zone in northern cyprus since the 1974 invasion 
which partitioned the island the invasion followed a coup by greek 
cypriot extremists aimed at uniting the entire island with greece 
the realities of cyprus are that in these years turkey 
instead of recucing its military presence here has been building 
it up in every way he said 
he also accused turkey of bringing in 40000 to 50000 turkish 
settlers to beef up the turkish cypriot minority which numbered 
120000 at the time of the invasion the greek cypriot population 
is more than 500000 
after election results were announced early monday vassiliou 
said he would work for the withdrawal of turkish troops and 
settlers but woud try to achieve a spirit of rapprochement with 
the turkish cypriots 
greekturkish negotiations have been stalled since president 
spyros kyprianou who lost a bid for a third term in the first 
round of elections feb 14 rejected proposals for a twozone 
federation proposed by the united nations in 1986 
the proposals had been accepted by denktash who now insists 
upon them as the basis for restarting talks 
kyprianou had insisted that before any talks began on a 
federation all turkish troops must withdraw and the turks must 
allow greek cypriot refugees who fled after the 1974 invasion to 
return to their homes in the north 
the un proposals suggested that talks on troop withdrawal and 
the right of return would be discussed by committees 
simultaneously with talks on the nature of the federation

secretary of state george p shultz tasted the 
fruits of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms firsthand monday as he 
hosted a candlelit dinner at a cooperative restaurant that was once 
a moneylosing bar 
the redbrick skazka fairy tale restaurant off 
southeastern moscows taganka square would have been illegal before 
last years decision by soviet authorities to loosen laws governing 
individual labor and cooperative ownership 
as soon as we heard they were authorizing cooperatives we 
decided to start one said sergei v kutuzov the head of the 
ninemember collective that runs the skazka 
the restaurant which can seat 34 customers in its upstairs 
dining room opened april 1 last year its hearty russian fare 
swiftly made it so popular with muscovites and foreign residents 
that profits soared to as much as 23300 a month kutuzov said 
skazkas friendly waitresses and prompt service are in stark 
contrast to the situation that prevails at most of moscows 
stateowned restaurants where customers sometimes wait for hours 
before being served 
cooperatives are also more expensive than staterun restaurants 
which has led some soviets to oppose them as socially unjust 
the dinner menu offered shultz cost between 25 and 33 per 
person kutuzov said compared to an average of 3 to 8 for an 
evening meal in a governmentowned restaurant 
a table piled with sturgeon in aspic pickled vegetables inside 
a pumpkin bottles of mineral water and grapes was set out for 
shultz who had finished two days of talks in moscow with top 
soviet officials including gorbachev the communist party leader 
skazkas chefs also prepared homemade noodle soup with 
mushrooms a cabbage soup called shchi stuffed pork cutlets 
dumplings with mushroom and chicken and small russian pancakes 
shultz who was accompanied by his wife helena and us 
ambassador jack matlock met in the dining room with some of the 
soviet unions top cultural figures and intellectuals including 
cinematographer elem klimov playwright mikhail shatrov economist 
nikolai shmelov and writer vladimir soloukhin 
reporters briefly allowed into the woodpaneled room before 
shultz arrived spotted one apparent concession to the vip guests 
bottles of georgian and french wines set out on a table 
as a cooperative the skazka normally does not have the right to 
serve alcohol 
gorbachev said in midjanuary that 13000 coops had been 
established in the soviet union he said more than 300000 people 
were working for themselves within guidelines set by the government 
to encourage better services and goods than those provided by the 
staterun sector 
the venture has been a clear success for the nine people who put 
up a total of 5000 to launch the skazka last month kutuzov 
chairman of the skazka cooperative took home 1050 more than 
three times the average soviet wage of 330 
the building that now contains the restaurant was once a bar 
favored by lyubers bodybuilding enthusiasts from a moscow 
suburb that some press reports have said prey on longhaired soviet 
youths who like western rock music 
either because of its tough clientele or because the 
healthconscious lyubers did not drink enough alcohol the bar lost 
money kutuzov said 
now its clientele has radically changed with foreigners making 
up as much as 90 percent of the dinner customers on a given 
evening kutuzov said

sen jesse helms has asked the cia to 
investigate allegations by a panamanian dissident that the agency 
passed personal information to panamas strong man gen manuel 
antonio noriega about helms and sen edward m kennedy it was 
disclosed monday 
the request was made in a letter helms sent last week to cia 
director william webster following congressional testimony two 
weeks ago by jose i blandon a former noriega associate who is now 
a leading critic of panamas defense chief 
in the letter a copy of which was made available to the 
associated press the north carolina republican said it is 
improper and illegal for the cia to maintain files on members 
of congress 
at the time of blandons testimony the cia said it 
categorically denies his allegations 
a cia spokeswoman sharon foster had no comment monday on 
helms letter except to say that communications from members of 
congress are confidential but are taken seriously and are answered 
in a separate letter to fbi director william sessions helms 
asked whether the agency had ever passed on information about 
members of congress or their staffs to the cia and whether it ever 
it had engaged in wiretaps or surveillance on him or members of his 
staff 
blandon testifying before a senate subcommittee on feb 9 said 
the cia passed to noriega data about helms kennedy dmass and 
two of their aides the two senators have been among noriegas 
strongest critics on capitol hill citing allegations of noriegas 
involvement in drug trafficking 
helms said blandons credibility appeared to be high he 
added that he received information from other countries indicating 
the cia had delivered similar information to them on other senators 
he asked webster whether the cia had ever maintained information 
on members of congress or their staffs and whether such information 
was ever passed on to any official of a foreign government 
specifically the panamanian defense forces 
helms indicated he was skeptical about the cias denial 
contending that it made an inquiry afterward to cia field offices 
and to the heads of us agencies involved in national security 
issues as to whether the denial was accurate 
ms foster of the cia said she was unable to comment on that 
allegation 
blandon meanwhile met under heavy guard monday at the us 
courthouse with prosecutors investigating the irancontra arms and 
money affair he presumably was questioned by the staff of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh about noriegas agreement to 
train nicaraguan rebels at the request of lt col oliver north a 
former national security council official who is a target of 
walshs investigation 
blandon was a key informant for federal prosecutors in florida 
who earlier this month obtained indictments charging noriega with 
taking at least 46 million in bribes to protect a major colombian 
drug ring

a principal witness in the drug conspiracy 
case against panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega faces up to 20 
years in prison when sentenced this week for his part in the ring 
which smuggled 500000 pounds of marijuana and 1 tons of cocaine 
into the united states 
but steven michael kalish 35 expects leniency for his 
testimony against noriega which included kalishs report that he 
made made 900000 in payoffs to the panamanian strongman 
obviously hes hoping he wont have to spend too much time in 
jail said dick deguerin kalishs friend and defense attorney in 
houston 
kalish pleaded guilty a year ago during the trial of his 
partner leigh bruce ritch and has since emerged as a principal 
witness against noriega in the tampa conspiracy case noriega also 
faces separate racketeering and drug charges in miami 
ritch 34 is serving a sentence of 30 years in prison 
in the tampa case kalish testified he gave noriega cash and 
jewelry in exchange for panamanian banking services and military 
protection 
kalish told a us senate panel last month that he became 
attracted to panama in 1983 because of its international banking 
facilities he flew there with 24 million in cash and met with 
cesar rodriguez contreras at the bank of boston building in panama 
city kalish said 
rodriguez who was slain in colombia in 1986 offered me an 
entire package of corporate banking and investment services and 
even armored car delivery from the airport kalish testified 
rodriguez introduced kalish to noriega at the generals home 
kalish told the committee at their first meeting kalish delivered 
a suitcase with 300000 cash he said and discussed his 
investment plans in panama for the next 10 months kalish told the 
panel he used panama as his base living in a threestory 
spanishstyle house around the corner from noriegas 
in november 1983 kalish bought the panamanian defense forces a 
boeing 727 jet to deliver shipments of drug profits from the united 
states to panama in exchange for a bell 212 helicopter kalish 
bought for the defense forces according to the charges noriega 
arranged for an irrevocable 2 million line of credit for kalish 
from a panamanian bank 
noriega also provided kalish with a diplomatic passport and 
agreed to let ritch and kalish use panamanian banks to launder more 
than 100 million in anticipated profits from a millionpound 
marijuana smuggling venture that kalish was organizing in colombia 
in early 1984 according to the federal charges 
kalish began his career in drug trafficking at an early age his 
friends say 
the son of a midlevel gulf oil corp executive who died in 
1980 kalish was born in texas and grew up in bellaire a 
comfortable suburb of houston deguerin said kalish was already 
selling marijuana when he dropped out of the 11th grade 
i dont believe he ever had a straight job said deguerin 
by age 27 kalish had been indicted twice in houston for trying 
to import 140000 pounds of marijuana in two loads nine days apart 
in december 1979 the second seizure 100000 pounds was then 
the largest ever in texas kalish eventually fled assumed a new 
identity and in 1983 settled in tampa where he worked with ritch 
says assistant us attorney robert kennedy in tampa 
kalish and ritch set up a smuggling organization and a 
sophisticated nationwide distribution network that made more than 
200 million in four years 
the kalishritch organization began to fall apart when the fbi 
arrested kalish on july 26 1984 as he was boarding a chartered 
lear jet under an assumed name at tampa international airport

nofziger 63 was convicted feb 11 of three counts of illegally 
lobbying former white house colleagues on behalf of wedtech corp 
a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of the air force 
a10 antitank plane 
the former white house political director faces a potential 
twoyear prison term and a 10000 fine for each of the three 
convictions he is scheduled to be sentenced march 25 
in its motions in us district court the defense repeated 
contentions made throughout the fourweek trial that the 
prosecution team headed by independent counsel james c mckay 
failed to prove that the issues nofziger raised with former 
colleagues were particular matters of direct and substantial 
interest to the white house 
the gross insufficiency of the evidence mandates that the 
guilty verdict against mr nofziger b set aside and that a 
judgment of acquittal be entered defense lawyer robert plotkin 
and e lawrence barcella said in their pleadings 
in asking for a new trial the defense said the definition of 
direct and substantial interest that flannery gave the jury 
during final instructions clearly encompassed interest well 
beyond the scope of the statute 
this instruction allowed jurors to confuse the personal 
interest of certain representatives of the white house with 
direct and substantial interest the defense said 
for instance references in testimony to pier f talenti a 
volunteer on nofzigers white house staff who visited wedtech 
corps plant might be the only basis for the jury to conclude the 
white house had an interest in wedtechs bid for a military engine 
contract the defense said 
although he was not called as a witness talenti was described 
by a former wedtech executive as expressing interest in the 
companys bid for a contract to build small engines for the army in 
1981 
an army procurement official also testified that talenti urged 
consideration of wedtechs bid that year 
the defense said flannerys internally inconsistent and 
confusing instruction failed adequately to explain the 
comparative and relative importance of a matter to the white house 
and it did not instruct the jury to place that interest in its 
proper context 
nofziger who left the white house in early 1982 was convicted 
among other things for sending an april 8 1982 memo to 
thenpresidential counselor edwin meese iii urging support for 
wedtechs efforts to persuade reluctant army officials to award the 
32 million contract 
the very purpose of the communication to mr meese was to 
create and stimulate interest a contact that is not prohibited 
by the law the defense said 
meese now attorney general testified at the trial that he 
couldnt recall receiving nofzigers note which suggested he 
enlist the support of reagan and other top administration officials

former tv evangelist pat robertson took out 
55 million in loans last month as the presidential contenders 
headed to the cashdraining super tuesday primaries and george 
bush remained by far the richest candidate with more than 9 
million in the bank 
among democratic hopefuls money leader michael dukakis had a 4 
million bankroll his financial statement shows 
robertson reported 55 million in loans and contributions of 
13 million during january in addition to the 65 million he got 
in federal matching funds robertson had earlier said he might not 
use the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed to 
the public financing system 
he ended the month with 55 million in cash on hand second 
only to bushs warchest but robertson had an outstanding debt of 
6 million 
robertsons campaign did not immediately return calls monday 
evening to answer questions about where he got the loan or what it 
was for 
in an interesting twist bush while raising the most money has 
actually spent less against the overall primary season spending 
limit than any of the other republican contenders including the 
struggling campaign of rep jack kemp of new york 
the bush forces have been carefully husbanding their resources 
to ensure they dont reach the 27 million limit too early in the 
nominating campaign thereby shorting themselves for the contests 
that come after the super tuesday races on march 8 
the latest campaign figures are contained in reports filed over 
the weekend with the federal election commission the reports cover 
totals for the month of january 
as of jan 31 the vice president had spent 107 million 
against the 27 million cap compared to kemps 128 million sen 
bob dole rkan had spent 135 million and ended january with 
42 million in the bank 
robertson reported spending a whopping 175 million against the 
cap and his report showed heavy expenditures across the super 
tuesday states topped by more than 1 million spent in texas by 
contrast bush spent 335743 in texas dole spent 81645 there 
and kemp spent 11312 
on the democratic side none of the candidates were approaching 
that level with dukakis spending the most against the ceiling at 
78 million 
kemp continued to squeak by financially taking out 750000 
worth of loans in january and ending the month with a debt of 13 
million kemp hoped to pay that off with the help of nearly 
600000 in government matching funds he expects to receive by the 
end of this month said campaign political director charlie black 
kemp aides are relying on a heavy mail solicitation which has 
brought in a steady flow of money in recent weeks including most 
of the 1 million kemp raised in january he said kemp is netting 
about 400000 a week in fundraising black said 
black insisted the campaign is not in serious financial trouble 
though he conceded sure id like to have another couple million 
to spend on super tuesday he said he has budgeted about 15 
million for the campaign through super tuesday and is spending 
between 250000 and 300000 on television for south carolinas 
march 5 primary 
black said that kemps spending against the overall limit is not 
a problem because he will buy tv time in only seven super tuesday 
states 
among the democrats sen paul simon of illinois and rep 
richard gephardt of missouri both ended january in debt and had to 
take out loans to keep their campaigns afloat in februarys iowa 
caucuses and new hampshire primary 
simon took out a 523674 loan in january and ended the month 
with a 691069 debt and only 401176 in the bank 
gephardt did not report any january loans but according to 
aides did borrow money this month he entered february with 
820260 in debts and 172477 in cash on hand 
democrats michael dukakis the massachusetts governor and sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee on the other hand were in good shape 
dukakis with 4 million in the bank and 511789 in bills to pay 
off and gore with 2 million on hand and 84248 in obligations 
gore ignored the iowa race to concentrate on the super tuesday 
states but he raised very little money during the time the other 
candidates were campaigning hard in iowa and new hampshire he 
collected only 180746 in contributions during january in 
addition to the 18 million in matching funds he got his report 
showed 
dukakis raised 804839 in contributions and got 35 million 
matching funds 
most candidates got very large matching fund payments in 
january the first month the government funds were released and 
the sums were based on the candidates fundraising for all 
preceding months candidates can receive matching funds from the 
federal treasury for every contribution of 250 or less the fund 
is supported by the 1 checkoff on individual tax returns 
democratic contender jesse jackson reported raising 610036 in 
donations plus 598021 in matching funds during january ending 
the month with 509978 in cash on hand and 354881 in obligations 
former colorado sen gary hart ended the month with 615547 in 
cash on hand after collecting 70303 in contributions and 937325 
in matching funds 
simons finance director bob edgar announced that the senator 
has raised more than 1 million in donations so far this year and 
in the two weeks following the feb 8 iowa contest set a record for 
his campaign 
his report shows that in january he raised 534259 in 
contributions 19 million in matching funds and 523674 in 
loans 
gephardt collected 212702 in contributions and 19 million in 
matching funds gephardts campaign manager bill carrick has said 
that the congressman will not buy tv advertising in all 20 super 
tuesday states but will concentrate on texas arkansas louisiana 
oklahoma and florida 
as of the jan 31 report however gephardt had spent very 
little in those states for example a total of 69809 in texas 
compared to dukakis 301829 and 23454 in florida compared to 
dukakis 206861 there 
in arkansas louisiana and oklahoma gephardt had spent less 
than 5000 each as of the beginning of this month 
dukakis has also far outspent gore in the south a region in 
which the tennessee senator has pinned his presidential hopes

all firefighters scheduled to work 
monday nights shift joined scores of other colleagues in calling 
in sick leaving providences fire protection to 87 firefighters 
who have been on duty around the clock since friday 
meanwhile a superior court judge delayed ruling on the citys 
request for contempt citations against 110 firefighters who called 
in sick over the weekend in defiance of a backtowork order 
judge americo campanella gave union president leo j miller 
until 10 am tuesday to inform all 450 members of the union that 
they must to return to work under the temporary restraining order 
issued saturday by another judge 
miller was also ordered to furnish a list of all firefighters 
who had called in sick over the weekend and outline the nature of 
their illness or the illness of family members they said they were 
staying home to care for 
city officials went from home to home monday leaving notices for 
firefighters of the contempt hearing campanella indicated his 
decision to put off ruling on the matter hinged on the relatively 
low number of firefighters contacted either by the city or miller 
the union represents 450 of the citys total uniformed force of 
479 campanella indicated his decision to put off ruling on the 
matter hinged on the relatively low number of firefighters 
contacted either by the city or miller 
miller a fire captain denies the union orchestrated any 
sickout 
if found to be a job action as moise and city officials assert 
the sickout would be illegal under rhode island law 
the dispute apparently concerns language in a contract ratified 
by firefighters in december that the city has yet to sign 
miller said the city is trying to renege on a provision that 
calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit 
union members also complain that promises to replacement wornout 
or damaged equipment like boots helmets and firecoats have not 
been fulfilled 
all but one of the 51 firefighters scheduled to report for work 
at 8 am saturday called in sick friday said fire chief michael 
f moise 
an additional 60 called in sick for the shift that was supposed 
to begin at 6 am sunday moise said 
assistant fire chief gilbert h mclaughlin jr told campanella 
that all of the firefighters scheduled to report at 6 pm monday 
had called in sick 
i have nobody coming in mclaughlin testified 
the union represents 450 of the citys total uniformed force of 
479 the firefighters divided into four platoons work two 10hour 
days and two 12hour days then are off four days 
moise said the 87 firefighters in the platoon that has been kept 
on duty since friday evening will stay on the job until the issue 
is resolved 
the chief testified the average absentee level is seven to eight 
firefighters for any particular shift 
miller agreed the number of sick firefighters was unusually 
high 
most of the people he contacted after the restraining order was 
issued said either they or someone in their family had a 24hour 
virus miller said 
miller said he called in sick because his mother who has heart 
trouble also had the flu 
ragosta tried to show the sickout presented a danger to the 
public health and safety moise said he was becoming concerned that 
fatigue among firefighters on the job since friday might affect 
their ability to operate sophisticated equipment and their response 
time in a crisis 
he said the sickout was costing 20000 a day in overtime and 
related expenses

an oil rig helicopter and a phantom jet fighter 
came within a halfmile of colliding over the north sea on monday 
according to the helicopter firm it was the third reported 
nearmiss in two weeks in britains crowded skies 
the earlier incidents involved jetliners carrying hundreds of 
passengers and prompted calls for an inquiry into growing air 
congestion before the summer travel season begins the government 
on monday accused air traffic controllers of fomenting public 
hysteria and said there was no cause for alarm 
bristow helicopters said its puma craft carrying 11 passengers 
and two crew members from an oil rig 165 miles northeast of 
aberdeen climbed sharply as it neared the scottish city after air 
traffic controllers warned that it was on a collision course with a 
royal air force jet 
bristow said its helicopter moved up from an altitude of 2000 
feet and the phantom passed below both aircraft landed safely and 
no one was reported injured 
a bristow spokesman said the helicopter pilot filed an air 
miss report with the civil aviation authority or caa 
earlier monday transport secretary paul channon promised an 
investigation into an incident sunday involving a british 
caledonian ba 111 and a pan american boeing 727 
channon told the house of commons the jetliners came within 
2000 yards while flying over southern england but he said they 
were not in danger of colliding 
he said the number of nearmisses had declined sharply in the 
last 10 years we musnt be complacent neither must we 
overreact he said 
in the previous incident this month a british airways lockheed 
l1011 and a balkan bulgarian tu 54 with a total of 543 people 
aboard narrowly avoided colliding the caa called that an 
exceptionally serious case and channon said the authority took 
the unusual step of asking the department of transport to make an 
independent investigation 
according to the caa the number of nearmisses per 100000 
flying hours in british air space decreased from 62 in 1980 to 28 
in 1986 
it said there were 12 incidents involving serious risk last 
year unchanged from 1986 
chris stock president of britains largest air traffic 
controllers union said the control system is nearly overloaded 
the system is working at full blast said stock head of the 
1500member guild of air traffic controllers if a mistake is 
made then there is very little room to maneuver 
he said safety should improve when a new computer system is 
inaugurated in 1990 and a new control center in 1995 the guild has 
demanded increased manpower in the meantime saying five job 
vacancies at the main control center in west drayton have not been 
filled since september 
the caa on monday claimed the controllers were promoting public 
alarm to gain leverage in negotiations over working conditions 
including the number of controllers on duty at peak times 
the controllers are putting pressure on the caa by harping on 
the subject of safety said the authority spokesman who was not 
identified in line with government policy anonymous controllers 
are constantly feeding information engendering alarm and concern

massachusetts gov michael dukakis said monday he might 
authorize military operations against terrorist base camps if he 
wins the white house gop hopeful bob dole taunted vice president 
bush for ceasing efforts in south dakota and minnesota 
battlegrounds for this weeks campaign contests 
i dont know where george bush is dole said in duluth 
later today were going to send him a map of minnesota so at 
least he gets a little idea where it is 
bush was in south carolina and tennessee virtually conceding 
the south dakota primary and minnesota caucuses to his gop rivals 
but he predicted he wouldnt be hurt by that 
i think im going to be the next president of the united 
states the vice president said in myrtle beach sc 
dole is heavily favored to win the south dakota contest but he 
sounded less confident of his chances for victory in minnesota 
where former television evangelist pat robertson and rep jack kemp 
have waged energetic campaigns 
on the democratic side dukakis has invested heavily in 
minnesota in hopes of bagging a win outside his new england 
backyard he rep richard gephardt sen paul simon sen albert 
gore jr and jesse jackson have campaigned heavily in south dakota 
as well 
gephardt campaigned in south dakota and wyoming while his 
spokesman accused gore of hypocrisy and released a list of what he 
said were switches in position the tennessee senator has made on 
issues ranging from abortion to farm policy to spending for the mx 
missiles 
that was an attempt to turn the tables on gore who has 
vigorously attacked gephardt for switching his position on key 
issues 
dukakis made a brief visit to washington where he took part in 
a national governors association meeting with president reagan 
he emerged from the session to blast the presidents 
antiterrorism policy and say the united states would be living 
with the consequences of secret arms sales to iran for a long time 
you never ever make concessions to terrorism dukakis said 
if you ever do it then your policy is worthless 
he added this is international crime pure and simple and you 
fight it the way you fight crime with tough police work with 
effective undercover operations with military operations against 
terrorist base camps if necessary 
dukakis did not elaborate on what conditions might prompt him to 
authorize military operations 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said such talk could 
conceivably make life more difficult for a hostage i would 
simply urge caution on everyones part including political 
candidates he said 
simon was in minnesota during the day invoking the name of the 
states late sen hubert h humphrey as he bid to score well in the 
caucuses 
the illinois senator was cheered enthusiastically by a crowd at 
gustavus adolphus college in st peter minn where he said he 
would propose a mutual nuclear test ban treaty with the soviet 
union if elected 
simon once said he needed to win in either minnesota or south 
dakota this week to keep his campaign alive but has since pulled 
back from that standard i am going to do respectably he said 
adding he believes the democratic race will stay muddled beyond the 
march 8 round of contests mostly in southern and border states 
known as super tuesday 
in washington financial reports filed with the federal election 
commission showed bushs campaign with the biggest bankroll 9 
million going into the super tuesday primaries among democratic 
hopefuls dukakis led with 4 million on hand 
robertson reported 55 million in loans and contributions of 
13 million during january in addition to the 65 million he got 
in federal matching funds robertson had earlier said he might not 
use the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed to 
the public financing system 
he ended the month with 55 million in cash on hand second 
only to bushs warchest but robertson had an outstanding debt of 
6 million robertsons campaign did not immediately return calls 
monday evening to answer questions about where he got the loan or 
what it was for 
with most of the campaign still to go bush had spent 107 
million against the 27 million campaign limit compared with 
kemps 128 million and doles 135 million robertson reported 
spending a whopping 175 million against the cap and his report 
showed heavy expenditures across the super tuesday states 
on the democratic side dukakis had spent the most against the 
ceiling at 78 million 
also on monday democrat gore won the endorsement of alabama 
sen howell heflin as he continued lining up support of as many 
southern politicians as possible in advance of super tuesday 
but in an unusual news conference heflin said he wanted to 
educate gore on some of the issues hes not too far to the 
left but ive got to try to bring him to the middle a little 
bit heflin said im going to work on him 
in the republican race kemp appeared before an economics class 
at the university of minnesota and called bushs advocacy of a 
fouryear budget freeze embarrassing 
said kemp can you think of anything more yawning in a 
peresidential campaign that having the republican candidate running 
for president say if i become president im going to freeze the 
budget for four years 
robertson was in south carolina where he has declared he needs 
a win in the march 5 primary he announced his support for 
legislation to limit textile imports and challenged bush to do the 
same 
at lander college in greenwood robertson won applause when he 
called for school prayer it used to be he said that little 
children could pray in the public schools of america and weve got 
to see that once again 
dole won the endorsement of south carolina sen strom thurmond 
the kansas senators campaign manager former sen bill brock 
took several sharp jabs at bush and his campaign he accused the 
vice presidents campaign of taking two cheap shots before the 
iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary 
he said the first attempt failed the second one worked short 
term well see whether they worked in the long term he said

navy secretary james h webb abruptly resigned 
monday accusing defense secretary frank c carlucci of abandoning 
the reagan administrations goal of a 600ship navy and of 
demonstrating a lack of leadership and vision 
this building needs to be led webb said in telling 
reporters of his decision it needs leadership it needs some 
vision im saying that if i had a piece of advice to give to 
secretary carlucci it would be to spend a lot more time with the 
top leaders in this building 
hes been spending a lot of time with the state department and 
a lot of time on the hill i think they pentagon leaders need to 
feel his vision and to understand what he believes in 
webb 42 a highly decorated marine veteran of vietnam combat 
and the author of the bestselling vietnam war novel fields of 
fire left after only 10 months in his pentagon position 
he told president reagan in his resignation letter that the 
president could have realized his cherished goal of building a 
600ship fleet were it not for carlucci 
an administration official who asked not to be identified said 
carlucci wants to recommend that william l ball iii assistant to 
the president for legislative affairs be nominated to replace 
webb the source said the white house probably would announce 
balls nomination on tuesday at the same time it announces formal 
acceptance of webbs resignation 
talking to reporters webb accused carlucci of ordering him to 
keep quiet about internal budget fighting saying the defense chief 
had written him a note saying he should deny news stories reporting 
it was the defense department and not the navy proposing to 
mothball ships 
now im not going to deny the truth webb said 
carlucci declined to respond to the criticism issuing a written 
statement saying only that he had learned of webbs resignation 
decision with regret 
the pentagon added in a separate statement however that if 
webb had decided he could not defend the departments decisions 
on the budget then under the circumstances he has done the 
honorable thing 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said secretary 
carlucci is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the 
pentagon to accommodate budgetary reductions secretary webb 
indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints but i 
know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the 
country 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate armed 
services subcommittee that oversees the navy budget said in a 
statement im sorry to see jim webb go in his brief stint he 
impressed the armed services committee as an able secretary 
although i am not endorsing his views his resignation has 
obviously launched an important new stage of the debate about 
pentagon priorities and the size and type of navy we need 
three times webb said the navy developed a plan for cutting 
its fiscal 1989 budget in such a way that the goal of expanding the 
fleet to 600 ships could still be reached and each time he said 
the navys advice was ignored by carlucci 
i can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of 
our fleet to a point that it may never reach the 600ship goal was 
motivated by other than military and strategic reasoning webb 
wrote reagan 
webb and others have argued that 600 ships were the minimum 
needed for the navy to meet its worldwide commitments 
since his recommendations were rejected by your secretary of 
defense i am unable to support him personally or to defend this 
amended budget during budget deliberations in congress webb 
said 
consequently i find it necessary to resign from my position 
as ecretary of the navy 
webbs decision to step down surprised navy and pentagon 
officials alike 
he assumed the post only last april seven months before 
carlucci succeeded caspar w weinberger 
the navy like all the services was ordered in early december 
to slash its fiscal 1989 budget proposal to comply with a new 
deficitreduction plan ultimately webb said the navy ended up 
being told to cut 123 billion from its original spending plan 
as finally approved by carlucci the navy has told congress it 
wants 964 billion in budget authority and intends to mothball 16 
navy frigates webb said 
the pentagon said the mothballing would leave the navy with 580 
ships by the end of fiscal 1989 and that it can still build to 600 
by fiscal 1992 
webb asserted however the mothballing is unnecessary and the 
navy would never reach 600 ships 
one of the sad things about this is that this is one of the 
few goals of the reagan administration that was really obtainable 
at pretty low cost webb said 
the navy could have transferred those 16 frigates to the naval 
reserve for well under 100 million rather than place them in 
mothballs preserving them as deployable warships ready for an 
emergency he declared 
webb declined to speculate on why carlucci might have rejected 
such options 
but in another broadside at the new defense secretary webb 
complained that once carlucci arrived the number of people who 
are participating in the decisions became smaller 
webb one of the youngest men to ever become navy secretary is 
a naval academy graduate 
he came to the pentagon in 1984 under weinberger assuming the 
post of assistant defense secretary for reserve affairs he had 
resigned and was preparing to leave government service in early 
1987 when the president asked him to replace john f lehman the 
first navy secretary of the reagan administration 
webb said monday he intended to return to his work as a novelist 
and possibly journalism as well

angry defiant palestinians 
marked martyrs day in the occupied territories monday with 
graveside speeches and stonethrowing demonstrations as they 
remembered the 61 arabs killed in clashes since december 
attorney general yosef harish meanwhile released a letter to 
defense minister yitzhak rabin criticizing rabins policy of 
allowing soldiers to beat protesters 
you cannot use force as a means of punishment abuse or 
humiliation harish said 
one palestinian was shot and wounded monday in this west bank 
town 10 miles north of jerusalem and another was shot during a 
demonstration at jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza strip according 
to hospital sources the army said it was checking the reports 
australian foreign minister bill hayden attending a dinner in 
jerusalem with foreign minister shimon peres criticized israels 
sometimes arbitrary and violent way of dealing with the 
disturbances 
the jersualem post reported the international committee of the 
red cross in geneva has strongly protested the israeli actions 
about 1500 additional police officers brought in from 
throughout israel flooded jerusalem in advance of the visit of 
us secretary of state george p shultz set to begin thursday 
the reinforcements will back up the holy citys normal contingent 
of 1000 officers 
authorities fear shultzs presence will lead to an upsurge in 
violence by arabs pressing their case for an end to 20 years of 
israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza seized during the 
1967 middle east war 
the latest spate of unrest started dec 8 and has resulted in 
scores of deaths hundreds of injuries and arrests 
in kfar naami a village of 2000 inhabitants six miles west of 
here about 1500 arabs marched through the streets chanting 
antiisraeli and antiamerican slogans 
in a fiery speech at the graveside of one of the two village 
residents who have died from army bullets a speaker rejected the 
shultz trip 
from this grave we condemn the shultz visit and the united 
states these masses he said gesturing to the crowd are led 
by the plo we will continue to achieve our goals and not satisfy 
american policy in the region 
grafitti in kfar naami read no for the visit of shultz yes 
to the palestinian government yes to the plo 
despite the rhetoric palestinian moderates are trying to 
persuade plo leader yasser arafat to lift his ban against local 
palestinians talking to shultz if washingtons peace plan is to 
succeed shultz needs to bring palestinians into the talks 
in an interview monday in tunisia arafat said the palestine 
liberation organization was ready to meet with the united states 
we have declared that we are ready to meet with all of the 
permanent members of the security council including the american 
administration arafat said speaking on cbstvs this 
morning 
without a meeting with palestinians the shultz initiative is 
bound to fail said sari nusseibeh a university professor and 
one of six arabs originally slated to meet shultz 
conservative prime minister yitzhak shamir has expressed strong 
reservations about the american initiative while saying he is 
willing to listen and consider any ideas from washington he 
clearly does not like the american initiative which revolves around 
swapping land for peace he also is worried about moving too 
quickly 
in a speech to european jewish leaders sunday night shamir said 
a long period of practical experience and coexistence is needed 
before the question of sovereignty can be broached 
any attempt to force the pace and to shorten the period would 
be a detriment to the very essence of the camp david agreement 
he said 
army radio said shamir told the parliaments foreign affairs and 
security committee israel will not withdraw from the territories 
even under pressure 
shamirs labor party rival foreign minister peres has largely 
accepted the american initiative 
in the upcoming days we will have a political discussion in 
the cabinet shamir told the radio monday then we shall see 
whether we he and peres can talk to mr shultz as partners or 
not 
the radio quoted the prime minister as saying he and peres could 
be forced to call early elections because of their disagreements 
justice ministry spokeswoman etty eshed said the attorney 
generals letter was prompted by the many complaints received from 
palestinians in the territories 
i checked them and found the number of the complaints 
raised suspicion that defining these cases as aberrations does 
not reflect reality harish wrote 
hayden nearing the end of a middle east tour told peres 
australians are deeply concerned by whats happening today in the 
unrest in the occupied territories the sometimes arbitrary and 
violent way in which it has been met 
in his response peres said israel did not want to dominate 
the palestinians and added i know my country has been painfully 
criticized by countries of the world we take it seriously with 
chagrin 
the jerusalem post quoted maurice aubert vice chairman of the 
international committee of the red cross as saying a letter 
recently was delivered to israels icrc representative in geneva 
calling on shamir to bring to an immediate end these serious acts 
perpetrated against civilians 
it said the letter declared that thousands of people have been 
the victims of brutality and grave illtreatment at the hands of 
israeli soldiers

the new operators of united press 
international pledged monday to reverse the news agencys financial 
losses but said they have not decided how to achieve that goal 
its a dynamic situation now paul steinle upis new 
president said at a news conference hirings firings and 
management changes are frozen for the next four to six weeks while 
the team draws up a business plan he said 
dr earl w brian chairman of wnw group inc the media 
investment group that assumed control of upi late friday said he 
and his associates will listen to everybody in devising a 
survival plan for upi 
we are going to employ the best skills we have to come up with 
a plan to take this business into the future brian said and i 
dont know what that is today 
steinle 48 said he believed the market would support two 
general wire services upi and the associated press i hope that 
is true he said adding he would not know the answer until he 
had interviewed current and potential clients 
we think it can survive in some form or another steinle 
said 
brian 45 is a physician who served as health and welfare 
commissioner in california under thengov ronald reagan he formed 
wnw group for the purpose of taking control of stock owned by mario 
vazquez rana the mexican publisher 
we purchased for cash a substantial cash payment an 
irrevocable proxy for control of upi brian said vazquez rana 
owns 95 percent of upi 
brian refused to say how much money was involved over the 
10year agreement but he said the amount vazquez rana receives 
will be influenced by what wnw finds in its study 
vazquez rana who paid 41 million to bring upi out of chapter 
11 protection proceedings in us bankruptcy court in june 1986 
relinquished all control over the stock brian had waged an 
unsuccessful effort to buy upi before the company emerged from 
chapter 11 
brian and steinle said vazquez rana reportedly sank 50 million 
into upi which is thought to be losing about 1 million a month 
while the new management studies upis financial picture and 
talks with news executives around the country brian said his 
company will underwrite upis losses yes its going to cost a 
million a month to sit here and do a plan he said 
brian said it is possible wnw may conclude there is no way to 
turn around upis finances which presumably could lead to shutting 
down the agency he called that scenario a low probability 
brian is chairman of infotechnology inc also known as 
infotech an electronic communications company based in new york 
infotechs subsidiaries include financial news network a 24hour 
cable television service providing stock prices data broadcasing 
corp questech capital corp tv value mart corp and comtex 
scientific corp 
upi is into a number of areas that are very synergistic to 
what infotech does brian said they include computer 
translations electronic data base marketing and electronic 
publishing 
infotech which will be a minority shareholder in wnw is a 
public company brian owns about 13 percent of the company and 
merrill lynch co owns about 145 percent 
from infotechs perspective we see this as an investment 
opportunity brian said we believe this company has a value 
greater than the amount of money it is losing 
brian who wore a upi pin in his lapel said he had other 
reasons for wanting the company to survive 
as a conservative republican as far as im concerned upi is 
an extremely important asset to the american people he told the 
los angeles times over the weekend 
once a plan is in hand brian said he will look for new 
investors they could include upis employees he said ultimately 
vazquez ranas ownership share will be reduced by the infusion of 
new stockholders he said 
brian was prohibited from buying upi outright partly because of 
an agreement the wire service guild representing the agencys 
editorial employees made with vazquez rana that deal calls for 
the union to have the right of first refusal to buy upi should 
vazquez rana sell it 
dan carmichael a guild negotiator said the union will ask 
brian to maintain the moneylosing company as a general 
international news organization the company has about 1400 
employees after laying off about 100 people in recent month 
representatives of the wsg and its parent the newspaper guild 
met for about an hour and a half with steinle on monday carmichael 
described the meeting as businesslike 
the guild asked for a copy of the financial deal between wnw and 
vazquez rana as well as use of the companys internal message wire 
for guild purposes 
wsg president kevin keane told steinle that the upi work force 
is unsettled because of the fequent turmoil and allowing the union 
to communicate with staffers on a timely basis would boost morale 
he said 
steinle said he could not guarantee there would not be layoffs 
in the future but he noted a freeze was in effect a wsg statement 
said 
al rossiter jr upis executive editor said morale has 
soared since the staff learned of the deal i am very 
optimistic he said 
steinle a former president of financial news network has a 
long career in journalism mainly the broadcast industry before 
joining fnn in 1983 he was a news director of kingtv in seattle 
wash and at wixttv in syracuse ny 
a native of chillicothe ohio he has also worked for 
westinghouse broadcasting corp between 1969 and 1974 covering 
events in both hong kong and saigon he has an mba from harvard 
business school 
upi was formed in june 1907 by the ew scripps co which sold 
the wire service in 1982 to media news corp the company filed for 
protection from creditors in april 1985 more than a year before it 
was bought by vazquez rana

a federal judge on monday dismissed a lawsuit 
challenging the constitutionality of new sentencing guidelines 
ruling that two public defender offices lacked legal standing to 
bring the case 
the decision by us district judge stanley sporkin dismissed 
the case on technical grounds it came four days after two federal 
judges in california had held the new sentencing guidelines were 
unconstitutional 
the two judges in san diego ruled that the 1984 law establishing 
the us sentencing commission was unconstitutional because it 
improperly placed the panel in the judicial instead of the 
executive branch in violation of the constitutions 
separationofpowers doctrine 
unlike the california cases the suit before sporkin did not 
involve defendants who faced sentencing under the new guidelines 
which provide a complicated set of factors for determining the 
length of a defendants incarceration 
sporkin found that federal public defenders offices in san 
diego and nashville lacked legal standing to sue because they 
couldnt show they were harmed by the new sentencing guidelines 
permitting lawyers to sue without clients or at best with 
only potential clients merely because their putatative clients 
allegedly will be harmed would open the same door for specialist 
lawyers to sue whenever congress enacts a statute which impacts on 
their clientele sporkin said 
the harm alleged by plaintiffs essentially boils down to 
their perception that their workload will be more complex and will 
markedly increase sporkin said 
that sort of harm or injury is no different from the 
harm that the passage of the tax reform act of 1986 caused for 
tax laywers or for that matter than the harm caused for criminal 
lawyers by the passage of the bail reform and speedy trial acts 
the judge said

the kidnappers of a us marine officer 
released a videotape monday in which he recited their demands 
including withdrawal by israel from its border security zone in 
south lebanon 
lt col william r higgins who appeared to be reading from a 
text written by his captors said president reagan has to take 
responsibility for the crimes he has committed against the 
oppressed people in the region 
higgins was abducted last wednesday on a highway south of tyre 
the ancient port 50 miles south of beirut 
a group calling itself the organization of the oppressed on 
earth which claimed responsibility for the abduction released the 
70second tape 
the kidnapping increased friction between two shiite moslem 
forces vying for domination in south lebanon the moderate amal 
militia which is trying to rescue higgins and hezbollah or party 
of god which is loyal to iran and is believed to be an umbrella 
for groups holding most of the 25 foreigners missing in lebanon 
amal militiamen and troops of the un peacekeeping force in 
south lebanon using dogs searched the caves and groves of the 
tyre area for the sixth day monday 
nbc nightly news reported important progress in the search 
in a report from southern lebanon it said sources there told nbc 
news the three gunmen who kidnapped higgins and three other gunmen 
who were in the getaway car have been caught 
it said the six are being interrogated by amal officers 
higgins is commander of the 76man observer grouplebanon 
attached to the un interim force in lebanon or unifil the south 
lebanon peacekeeping force 
hezbollah claimed the 43yearold marine from danville ky was 
removed from the area despite a dragnet by amal and un security 
officers release of the tape delivered to a western news agency 
in beirut suggested the abductors were able to get higgins out 
it is hard to believe that a videotape can be produced if the 
captive is held in a dangerous hideout said an independent 
informed shiite source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
amal which supports the un presence in predominantly shiite 
south lebanon views higgins abduction as a hezbollah challenge 
security sources in tyre said amal had closed the iranian cultural 
center and iranian revolutionary guards offices in the city 
hezbollah declared full support for the kidnappers and denounced 
amals enthusiam to determine the fate of a filthy american spy 
nine americans including higgins are among the 25 foreigners 
missing in lebanon the hostage held longest is terry a anderson 
chief middle east correspondent of the associated press kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
many of his taped remarks were in poor english indicating he 
did not write the message his face was close to the camera 
obscuring any background that might have indicated the location 
he appeared physically fit was unshaven and wore the same dark 
green sweater as when kidnappers stopped his car on the coastal 
highway 
a typewritten statement in arabic that accompanied the tape 
renewed the charge that higgins was a cia agent using the un job 
as a cover 
washington has denied this 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday the videotape 
obviously was made under duress 
to begin the statement the kidnapped marine said 
i william higgins in order to get me released these demands 
have to be met 
he recited the same conditions his captors set forth in a 
statement on friday claiming responsibility for the abduction 
withdrawal of israeli forces from the zone they maintain just 
north of the frontier as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla 
raids 
release of all lebanese and palestinian guerrillas from the 
khiam prison and all other prisons inside the zionist regime in 
occupied palestine israel holds about 300 lebanese and 
palestinians at khiam in the security zone 
an end to us intervention in lebanon and to middle east 
missions by american emissaries 
while giving the last condition higgins said the aim of us 
missions to the middle east was to surround the gains of the 
islamic revolution in occupied palestine 
that suggested the kidnappers wanted secretary of state george 
p shultz to cancel a scheduled trip this week in which he is to 
visit jordan egypt and israel and may go to syria and saudi 
arabia 
shultz was in moscow on monday where the middle east situation 
was figuring in his talks 
unifil spokesman timur goksel has said 20 officers of higgings 
group were withdrawn from three border posts after his abduction to 
the forces headquarters in naqoura a lebanese town just north of 
the israeli border 
the un relief and works agency evacuated its last five foreign 
employees from moslem west beirut to the christian eastern sector 
monday because of the kidnappings feb 5 of employees jan stening 
44 of sweden and william jorgensen 58 of norway

japan is asking the united states to 
reconsider its charges that a japanese scientific research 
whaling expedition in the antarctic is undermining international 
agreements the japanese embassy said monday 
ambassador nobuo matsunaga sent secretary of state george shultz 
a letter accusing the united states of taking unilateral action 
and unjustifiable measures in the whaling dispute an embassy 
statement said 
it referred to a feb 10 commerce department declaration that 
japans killing of minke whales in the antarctic violated 
international whaling agreements the declaration means that 
president reagan by april can order a 50 percent cut in the 
japanese fishing quota in us economic territorial waters and 
exclude japanese fish and fish products from us markets 
the current japanese fishing quota in the 200mile offshore us 
economic zone is zero but the declaration could be applied to 
future years as well as apply to sales of processed fish 
matsunagas letter restated the japanese government position 
that the current antarctic expedition is for noncommercial 
research provided for in the international whaling commission 
convention the united states and japan agreed in 1984 that japan 
would cease commercial whaling in 1987 
critics say that proposed harvest of hundreds of minke whales is 
excessive for research that the commission has not specifically 
authorized the current expedition and that the stated research into 
whale population diet and nutrition could be carried out without 
killing the whales 
the embassy said matsunaga in his letter dated friday 
strongly urged the us to reconsider its position in light of 
the damage these moves would cause to mutually beneficial 
usjapan fishery relations

the saga of the television evangelists has come full circle with 
the disgrace of jimmy swaggart who a year ago was the scourge of 
lust and greed among the pompadour boys in the religious 
broadcasting fraternity 
the scandal strikes an electronic church which has already been 
measurably diminished by last years controversies over jim 
bakkers adultery and high living and oral roberts claim that god 
might take me home if he failed to raise 8 million by the end 
of march 
my feeling is that there will be more damage and the 
credibility of those of us in christian broadcasting will be hurt a 
little bit more how much i dont know said jerry rose 
president of national religious broadcasters 
rose of wcfctv in chicago noted that swaggart had been a 
vigorous proponent of the nrbs efforts to improve financial 
accountability as well as an emphatic preacher about sexual 
morality 
a lot of people saw jimmy as a pacesetter for doing what 
needed to done in the church so in this case it is shocking 
rose said 
as bakker resigned in shame a year ago swaggart thundered 
god deliver us from these pompadour boys hair done nails done 
fresh from the beauty shop preaching the gospel 
even before swaggarts recent problems the namecalling among 
these men of god and the jokes of latenight comedians had moved 
pat robertson now a republican presidential contender to say that 
he resented being identified as a television evangelist 
swaggart by some measures the biggest of them all stepped 
down from his pulpit sunday after confessing that he had sinned 
against god and his family he didnt explain but others reported 
that the louisiana evangelist had been photographed entering a 
motel room with a prostitute 
were the last surviving ministry the last one the rev 
jerry falwell told students at his liberty university in lynchburg 
va on sunday bakker is gone robertson is gone running for 
president swaggart is now gone were the last the credibility 
crisis is unbelievable 
with that crisis came hard times for the television ministry 
falwell swaggart and roberts all have lost part of their audience 
and robertson laid off nearly 500 employees at his christian 
broadcasting network last summer and 145 more in november 
cbns contribution income dropped by 325 percent from april to 
october said benton miller the ministrys director of 
communications not only did the ptl scandal hurt miller said but 
falling oil prices cut into the income of some supporters and the 
stock market dived in october 
there was a real drought for a good bit of last year said 
falwells spokesman mark demoss who predicted monday that there 
may be little or no impact this time 
part of that is due to the way jimmy swaggart has handled his 
admission of wrongdoing demoss said i think another reason 
for that is thanks in great part to the media the general public 
now has a better understanding of the difference between a 
charismatic and noncharismatic ministry and now is able to tell 
the difference from one ministry to another 
i look at the example of a gary hart moral failure that did 
not ruin the democratic party or other democratic candidates but 
it did ruin gary hart demoss said 
falwell moral majoritys founder is an independent baptist and 
a fundamentalist charismatics may share his biblical literalism 
but they emphasize gifts of the spirit such as speaking in 
tongues and healing 
bakker and swaggart were both ordained by the assemblies of god 
a charismatic denomination 
swaggart had a larger audience 1720000 households per week 
last november than any other video evangelist according to the 
arbitron rating service the ac nielsen co put swaggarts 
audience at 860000 households second to robert schullers 
1189000 but nielsen said swaggart was seen on the most stations 
286 
arbitron reported that swaggarts audience had been 2161000 
households in february of last year before the ptl and oral 
roberts controversies between february and november last year 
arbitron said schullers audience dropped from 17 million 
households to 14 million roberts from 115 million to 900000 
and falwells old time gospel hour from 616000 to 495000 
those figures are for broadcast audience only most programs 
reach additional viewers on cable television 
the negative publicity started last year when roberts who had 
built an evangelistic empire including a university and a hospital 
in tulsa okla announced that god might call me home if he 
did not raise 8 million by the end of march 
bakker resigned march 19 1987 after admitting a sexual 
encounter with a young woman later identified as jessica hahn 
bakker said he had asked falwell to take over but later claimed 
that falwell had stolen ptl 
bakker and his top aide the rev richard dortch were 
subsequently defrocked by the assemblies of god 
the story popped up through the year the bakkers feuded with 
falwell who finally resigned in frustration in october jessica 
hahn turned up in the pages of playboy and in the mansion of hugh 
hefner 
in december the internal revenue service claimed that the 
bakkers had been paid 936 million in excessive compensation 
between 1981 and 1987 
this month ptls new trustee david clark filed suit against 
the bakkers and former aide david taggart seeking 528 million 
for mismanagement and unjustified compensation 
bakkers 81yearold parents raleigh and furnia bakker were 
laid off last week from their 500amonth jobs as greeters at the 
heritage usa resort where they have continued to live 
this month members of the national religious broadcasters 
adopted a financial code of ethics which will require public 
disclosure of annual independent audits of all income and 
expenditures except for salaries

portauprince haiti ap the army chief of staff denied 
monday night that the commander of haitis most repressive and 
powerful batallion is involved in cocaine trafficking 
there has been no complaint or judicial file received 
implicating col jeanclaude paul who has been singled out by the 
foreign press for denigration read the communique signed by gen 
carl nicolas and broadcast by the staterun radio nationale 
paul is the target of a us federal grand jury probe based on 
the testimony of oswaldo quintana a us drug enforcement agency 
informant who charged that paul uses his private airstrip and ranch 
outside portauprince to smuggle cocaine from columbia to florida 
the army statement refuted the socalled involvement of paul 
in affairs of drug trafficking and denounced the foreign press 
for its campaign of denigration against paul who is in his 
late 40s 
the statement also warned the local press not to repeat 
unfounded rumors of the foreign press 
several opposition newspapers reported with banner headlines a 
news conference given by quintana in miami last week implicating 
paul as a cocaine smuggler 
the communique stated that if the army high command has reason 
to believe that any army officer is guilty of misconduct an 
investigating committee will be created in accordance with the 
regulations of the armed forces of haiti 
pauls unit the widely feared dessalines barracks is 
responsible for virtually all army repression and killings of 
demonstrators in 1987 soldiers from the 700man batallion were

the former parish priest of an 
irish nationalist who was shot dead from an army observation tower 
said monday that police and soldiers harrassed the victim for 
several years 
british officials said they have launched an investigation into 
the incident sunday in northern ireland near the irish border but 
in dublin the irish government announced it will hold its own 
probe headed by the deputy irish police chief 
mcanespies death came at a time of severe strain in angloirish 
relations over other incidents involving the police and the 
provinces catholic minority 
the rev brendan mchugh said aidan mcanespie had to cross the 
irish border daily to go to work and was constantly harassed at the 
army checkpoint 
we complained time out of number to the police and military 
but no action was ever taken life for the poor man had just become 
unbearable he told reporters 
the army said it deeply regrets the shooting it said 
23yearold mcanespie was hit by a bullet fired from an army 
observation post about half a mile from the irish border in county 
tyrone 
police said the soldier involved was in military custody while 
an investigation was launched no details about the soldier were 
given police declined to comment on the priests allegations of 
harassment 
press association the british domestic news agency said 
security sources reported that the soldier involved told detectives 
a machine gun was accidentally discharged as he handed it to 
another soldier 
the agency also quoted unidentified sources as saying three 
strike marks were found on the roadway near the victim indicating 
three shots might have been fired 
mcanespies brotherinlaw paul mccabe said of the 
investigation announced by the dublin government we welcome any 
attempt to bring the murderer of aidan to real justice and ensure 
that there is not yet another coverup 
maybe at this late stage the irish government will finally 
recognize the reality of families like ourselves having to put up 
with constant harassment in the light of recent developments 
of incidents here in northern ireland i do not think anyone would 
be prepared to give evidence to the ruc 
the ruc royal ulster constabulary is northern irelands 
police force its policemen are frequent targets of irish 
republican army gunmen and bombers allegations that the ruc tried 
to thwart an investigation into the slaying of six unarmed 
catholics by an ruc unit in 1982 has intensified the deep hostility 
among many catholics toward the force 
the outlawed ira is fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite the province with 
the irish republic which is predominantly roman catholic 
relatives said mcanespie was walking to a regular weekly gaelic 
football game in the northern ireland village of aughnacloy county 
tyrone when he was shot he had passed through the checkpoint 
which lies on the route to the football ground 
francis molloy a local councilman said mcanespie was an 
election worker for sinn fein political arm of the ira the ira 
denied mcanespie was among their members 
mchugh said mcanespie was never involved in paramilitary 
activity but was harassed nevertheless 
he was never abused physically just verbally and his car was 
often taken apart mchugh said referring to vehicle searches 
i dont know why he was singled out for such treatment 
the campaign against him must have been going on for at least 
five years other young lads were also stopped but aidan appeared 
to be getting special treatment he said 
last month britain provoked irish outrage by saying it will not 
prosecute policemen accused of perverting the course of justice in 
the aftermath of the killing of six unarmed catholics in three 
incidents in late 1982 
the strain was compounded by a british appeals courts refusal 
to overturn the conviction of six irishmen accused of perpetrating 
twin bombings that killed 21 people in 1974 many irish officials 
and civilians believe the six are victims of a miscarriage of 
justice

republican presidential hopeful pat 
robertson said monday that somebody planned the eruption of a 
scandal involving television evangelist jimmy swaggart two weeks 
before the super tuesday primaries but he wouldnt say who he was 
talking about 
nothing happens to people by accident robertson a former 
television evangelist said in an interview monday with the 
anderson sc independentmail it is kind of funny this came 
up two weeks before the most important primaries in the nation 
people probably wonder what went on 
swaggart temporarily stepped down from the pulpit of his 
7500member church in baton rouge la on sunday amid allegations 
of sexual misconduct 
i think somebody had something to do with it said 
robertson somebody else planned all these things i am afraid 
robertson declined to say who he was referring to but said the 
political efforts will have little effect on his campaign 
because his supporters back him too strongly 
it the scandal will not affect me because it has nothing 
whatsoever to do with me he told the newspaper but i want to 
tell people to ask vice president george bush what he thinks 
about all this 
earlier monday robertson had said the troubles swaggart is 
having are unfortunate but that he didnt think the 
controversy would have any effect on his campaign 
it will have no more effect on me than gary hart had on robert 
dole he said hart dropped out of the democratic presidential 
race in may amid reports of his relationship with a miami model 
then rejoined the field in december 
in the interview with the anderson newspaper robertson accused 
the bush campaign of dirty politics and trickery directed 
at his campaign but offered no proof of such activity 
i have been told of bushs dirty tricks and i expect to see 
them in south carolina he said his campaign will use every 
kind of dirty trick against me because this state is important and 
i have a lot of support and george bush knows that 
bush campaign officials were not immediately available to 
respond to robertsons comments 
also on monday robertson called for a return to teaching 
methods used 40 years ago when children could still pray in public 
schools 
back then we maybe didnt have some of the fancy buildings 
and we werent spending 270 billion a year on education but 
little children could pray in the public schools of america and 
weve got to see that once again he said to applause from a 
group of about 800 people at lander college 
robertson said in recent math tests american students performed 
just above students in swaziland twentyfive percent of the 
students in one test couldnt even locate the united states of 
america on a map how can you defend a country when you dont even 
know where it is 
he said american education should once again stress the basics 
such as the multiplication tables science geography and american 
history

an amtrak switchman who fled his post after a 
derailment injured 25 passengers last month has tested positive for 
marijuana and at least one other drug officials familiar with the 
tests said monday night 
however one of the officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said authorities had not determined whether a link 
existed between the jan 29 accident and the results of the tests 
on thomas connor 30 of aldan pa 
he said the laboratory that performed the tests has been asked 
to clarify the analysis and the correlation remained an open 
issue he said he could not identify any other drugs that had 
been found 
connor was the control tower operator on duty when the train 
slammed into a work vehicle in chester pa near philadelphia he 
fled his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off a 
stretch of track undergoing maintenance 
connor did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72 
hours after the accident marijuana can remain in the system for up 
to 30 days 
connors lawyer arthur donato of suburban philadelphia said he 
had not been notified of the results 
i dont believe it donato said referring to the sources 
report 
john jacobsen an amtrak spokesman said the railroad also had 
not been informed of the results 
the nbc nightly news reported monday night that sources had 
found connor tested positive for high amounts of marijuana cocaine 
and a third unidentified drug 
bill loftus spokesman of the federal railroad administration 
said he could neither comfirm nor deny any reports about the drug 
tests pending notification to connor and amtrak 
loftus did confirm that the results had been received and said 
the railroad administration expected to issue a report on tuesday 
he said the findings were not simple 
connor was suspended without pay by amtrak then resigned last 
week citing physical and emotional stress 
calls to connors home were not answered monday night

if loyal fans of abcs moonlighting are 
gluttons for punishment that may be an asset for watching the show 
this season 
not within memory have television viewers had to put up with so 
much and gotten so little 
moonlighting is the most disappointing show this season and 
for those who loved the show it is a terrible thing to see it 
selfdestruct right on the screen 
what made this show go what gave it its charm and appeal were 
the scenes between cybill shepherd as maddie hayes and bruce willis 
as david addison these two opposites irresistibly drawn to each 
other in a lovehate relationship made the screen sparkle with 
their witty repartee 
but shepherds pregnancy caused a dilemma for the shows 
producers instead of shooting around it as most series do they 
made it a part of the story allyce beasley who plays miss 
dipesto was also pregnant but on the show she ignored it 
besides with her layered look it was hard to tell 
it might have seemed a smart move at the time to incorporate 
shepherds pregnancy into the story but it has turned into labor 
for the viewers 
maddie telling no one she was pregnant went off to chicago to 
brood with her parents david was left to deal with her absence 
moonlighting was left to slowly twist in the wind 
it was embarrassing watching the show deal with her absence it 
squirmed and made up stories like someone caught in a lie the 
whole point of watching moonlighting was to see those two carry 
on like spencer tracy and katharine hepburn in woman of the 
year the cases they solved were merely an excuse to get them 
together so they could disagree 
and when shepherd and willis finally got back together it 
wasnt any better forget the witty dialogue moonlighting 
turned into days of whine and roses 
although shepherd had twins maddie is still pregnant she told 
david the babys not his 
but the clincher was when she announced she had married a 
stranger a whole new character dennis dugan as a businessman she 
met on the train from chicago on impulse maddie married on 
impulse maddie the woman who wouldnt cross the street on 
impulse david is standing there with egg on his face trying to 
grin through it what a low blow what a letdown for the audience 
where is the famous dallas shower when we need it tell us 
the season was only a dream and not a nightmare 
maddie and david have become an unfunny bickering couple who 
have overstayed their welcome it was nice while it lasted but the 
magic is gone 
meanwhile abc has removed another show from its schedule 
sledge hammer a spoof on all those macho detectives started 
out in the nielsen cellar and never got out the show deserved 
better 
it made its debut in september 1986 against cbs dallas and 
nbcs miami vice after that introduction to obscurity abc 
transferred the show to 8 oclock thursday where it went up 
against nbcs the cosby show there it stayed until it was 
moved again back to friday against dallas and miami vice 
david rasche stars as the title character a oneman anticrime 
crusade whose idea of crime prevention is shooting a jaywalker 
the show has parodied such movies as vertigo play it again 
sam a clockwork orange dressed to kill and robocop 
its a funny show although its brand of satire may be difficult 
for some people to understand but the main reason the show never 
gained an audience was its time period it has never had a chance 
abc says it will bring the show back later it deserves a chance 
to be seen by a wider audience and not merely to be brought back in 
another bad time slot to play out its commitment

it isnt easy to make a rhinoceros look noble 
tragic even charming but producerwriter philip cayford does just 
that in his stunning national geographic special the rhino war 
that was part of what i was trying to do tried to make them 
look attractive tried to make them look cuddly because theyre 
not very cuddly and attractive and theyre not very appealable 
but they can be said cayford a british filmmaker and 
conservationist during a recent visit to new york 
the onehour documentary shot in kenya and zimbabwe last year 
airs sunday on superstation tbs it is narrated by richard kiley 
and features music by ladysmith black mombazo 
cayford has serious reasons for doing rhino pr of the more than 
30 species of rhinoceros that once existed on the african 
continent only five remain and all are endangered especially the 
black rhino in the early 1970s there were 65000 rhinos in 
africa now there are 4500 
says a park ranger in zimbabwe you do not want to show to 
your children one day how an elephant or a rhino look in a 
storybook 
ironically notes cayford in the films narration the 
very feature that evolved for the animals defense may bring about 
its extinction 
poachers are killing rhinos for the horn a rhinos horn is 
caratin like a human fingernail the easiest way to remove it is 
to kill the animal 
contrary to popular belief rhino horn powder is not primarily 
sought as an aphrodisiac but rather in the far east as a supposed 
fever reducer 
more recently however conservationists uncovered an alarming 
new market for much of the rhino horn north yemen where 
rhinohorn dagger handles are symbols of virility that command up 
to 15000 in the oilrich country there is plenty of money for 
such extravangances 
in africa the battle to save the rhino has in fact become a 
war complete with soldiers helicopters guns and death the 
enemies notes cayford are greed corruption and ignorance 
in zimbabwe where armed poachers moved after virtually wiping 
out the rhinos in eastern africa the government has given park 
rangers authority to shoot to kill poachers cayfords cameras 
capture the rangers exhilaration after a violent confrontation a 
dead poacher is juxtaposed with grim eloquence against the carcass 
of a rhino 
since 1985 more than 30 poachers have died so have 330 rhinos 
the rangers say they dont like to kill humans to save animals but 
feel the decision is a moral one the poachers are on the short end 
of the economic stick they risk their lives for a few hundred 
dollars the middlemen who smuggle the horns out of africa make 
thousands 
cayford says that despite their frightening appearance rhinos 
are peaceful beings nevertheless the filmmakers are seen rapidly 
retreating when one trots toward them 
cayford knows humans cant resist baby animals even rhinos one 
baby who was savaged by lions is seen on a preserve for orphaned 
and injured animals trotting about with his loyal new friend a 
spritely sheep 
he was sweet said cayford i saw him a couple of months 
ago and hes doing fine 
for conservationists it is an uphill battle to convince 
africans who are struggling to develop their countries that saving 
wildlife should be a priority africans themselves are beginning to 
take up the cause michael werikhe of kenya walks across his 
country promoting wildlife conservation its time wildlife 
awareness was taken to the people he says its them who have 
the final say 
there is concern sure theres concern cayford said it 
just takes time at the time people were wiping out the bison 
nobody cared very much 
what you have to do is come to the country understanding the 
countrys problems and helping rather than preaching he said 
you show them how wildlife has an economic value that if you 
look after wildlife by doing this this and this its going to 
bring you a natural benefit that its not something just to 
preserve for its own sake which is a nice idea but it only works 
when you can afford it 
at the conclusion of the film the camera pans from a rhino 
standing majestically on a ridge to the tall fence that he faces 
if the rhino war is lost by the conservationists the narration 
says the rhino will be doomed to exist in a childs picture book 
of things that once were but are no more

that the military regime has succeeded in politically neutralizing 
many dissidents by fear making violent repression no longer 
necessary 
speaking in interviews they said that although torture is still 
common the government has developed other more subtle methods 
including the continued enforcement of a nationwide state of 
emergency that empowers it to severely curtail basic civil rights 
the government has also issued a number of specially tailored 
decrees and laws that give a formal legality to repression and 
ensure impunity to many human rights violators the specialists 
maintain 
as an example they cited the widenening scope of military 
justice during the last two years 95 percent of those tried by 
military courts were civilians according to alejandro hales 
president of chiles bar association 
hales said 90 percent of those tried were eventually freed 
without charges but most of them were kept incommunicado for long 
periods sometimes up to 40 days 
the specialists contended that repression now often works 
through indimidation and threat including the action of several 
shadowy rightwing extremist groups that kidnap beat up and 
occasionally even kill people authorities deny any connection with 
such groups and have promised to investigate 
nearly 200 chileans claim to have received death threats in 
recent months from the extremist groups including some well known 
dissidents and many have been briefly kidnapped and physically 
abused 
one group the september 11 commando took responsibility for 
the killing of five leftists the day after a bloody but 
unsuccsessful attempt to kill pinochet in 1986 five young 
communists have been missing since september and a group called 
chilean anticommunist action claimed responsibility feb 15 for 
their abduction and disappearance 
these methods have an extremely paralyzing and brutally 
frightening effect on most people said garreton 
lawyers and human rights activists including hales and 
garreton said they are convinced that those groups are 
centralized and connected to official security services 
jaime troncoso research director of the independent chilean 
human rights commission said threatening is the new tactic for 
repression 
the critics point out that although most cases remain unsolved 
every time a member of one of those groups was discovered he 
proved to be a member of the military or the security services an 
army lieutenant patricio contreras was killed three years ago by 
a bomb he was planting at a church in the southern city of punta 
arenas a number of leaflets of the chilean anticommunist action 
group were found at the site 
fernando volio a costa rican who is the united nations 
officially designated human rights inspector for chile has 
denounced the existence of the extremist groups unless they are 
dismantled he said this society will remain torn apart 
in the years after pinochet and the military seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup hundreds of leftist dissidents were killed and 
at least 683 cases of political prisoners who disappeared have been 
documented by local and foreign human rights groups the torture of 
prisoners was considered widespread 
summary executions have long since ceased and arbitrary arrests 
have decreased sharply 
according to figures gathered by the chilean human rights 
commission 33903 people were arbitrarily arrested in 1986 while 
the figure went down to 6255 in 1987 
the commission registered 106 cases of torture of dissidents in 
1987 compared to 290 a year earlier 
the commissions troncoso stressed in an interview that we 
have never had a single report proved unfounded we are extremely 
rigorous there are many claims we do not publish for lack of 
evidence 
since the 1973 coup the un human rights commission regularly 
has issued reports that are highly critical of the chilean 
government the us state department has also been critical of 
chile in its annual countrybycountry report submitted to congress 
this years reports by the un and the state department while 
still critical noted an improvement in the general situation of 
human rights here but the us report mentioned continued torture 
of prisoners 
the government rejected the reports an official statement said 
the us report reflects only a partial picture of reality 
has errors and mentions some facts that have not been proved 
carlos varas secretary of a governmentappointed human rights 
commission said the us report shows a lack of knowledge of the 
chilean situation 
the government also complains that its critics fail to refer to 
terrorism by leftist guerrilla groups when discussing the human 
rights situation 
human rights activists criticize government legislation they 
contend is tailored to curb dissent they cite the 1980 
constitution which outlaws totalitarian doctrines such as 
marxism and an amnesty law that they claim favors scores of human 
rights violators 
they also cite the nationwide state of emergency and widened 
state of siege legislation that severely curtail civil rights and 
grant authorities wide powers to supress dissent including the 
exile of dissidents banning of public meetings censorship of the 
mail and communications and restrictions of freedom of the press 
and of labor unions

frances system of education admired worldwide f timeproven methods 
has become a source of concern 
in french homes where it is increasinglyor 
its rigorous regarded as a misfit in 
the modern world 
to its critics of the late 1980s it is like a fine old car on a 
superhighway it still works and still draws ahs but needs a 
tuneup or an overhaul to keep up with the traffic 
the fundamental problems with french education is that it is 
an extremely selective system and leaves aside too large a 
proportion of youth who dont finish their studies said olivier 
bertrand of the governmentrun center for the stuy 42 to 43 percent of 
french students finish high school and 
only about 22 to 23 percent go on to higher studies at a university 
or a prestigious grande ecole according to bertrand 
about 46 percent of french students receive what is known as 
professional formation for a specific trade be it in a 
hospital or a bakery 
we are conscious these levels are no longer adapted to the 
economic and social needs of today said bertrand if you 
compare it to countries like the united states or japan we are far 
behind 
the parisbased organization for economic cooperation and 
development which seeks to promote economic and social development 
in its 19 member countries agrees with the systems critics 
the education system is geared toward helping the academically 
inclined it is in fact a highly selective system which eliminates 
the weaker pupils at each different level and tends to brand them 
as losers it said in a 1984 report on youth employment in france 
the grandes ecoles perhaps represent the ultimate example of 
selection in the education system since the 18th century higher 
education in france has been dominated by the elite specialized 
schools not universities which turn out the future leaders of 
government and industry 
one of the grandes ecoles is the ecole nationale 
dadministration whose graduates have a nearmonopoly on top jobs 
in the government bureaucracy and figure prominently in politics 
another is lecole polytechnique run by the defense ministry 
which turns out most of the nations top engineers many of whom 
become chief executives in stateowned or private industries 
looking toward a more competitive continent when the european 
economic communitys open border policy starts in 1992 france is 
scrutinizing its education system and finding it heading for or 
already in a state of crisis 
students illprepared for the job market a lack of funds a 
topheavy structure and an aging diminishing university teaching 
corps are among other problems 
a governmentordered report on university professors released 
feb 18 spoke of the vertiginous degradation of their lot in 
pay lack of work incentives and mediocre working conditions 
for the student the lot is determined in a process of 
selection with the first at about age 13 based on performance in 
french and mathematics 
universities present the opposite problem any student with a 
baccalaureate from high school can enter there is almost universal 
agreement that the 78 staterun universities need to be reformed 
but successive governments have faced a student broadside in trying 
to do so 
for the past 20 years the university has been the sick man of 
france said the newsweekly le point in a cover story on 
universities 
while 80 percent of university graduates find jobs within 10 
months of receiving diplomas 70 percent of the jobs are either 
administrative or not in the graduates field 
even critics of the system say a student who passes the 
baccalaureat the severaldayslong exam at the end of high school 
is better equipped academically than an american high school 
graduate 
but according to current thinking the student is not 
necessarily better prepared to meet the requirements of the job 
market 
it is generally charged that national education is lagging 
behind in comparison with the needs of companies bertrand said 
in the universities teaching is mainly theory said a 
24yearold doctoral student laurence guillochet when you 
leave you have lots in your head but you dont know how to do 
anything 
premier jacques chirac a presidential candidate in spring 
elections was confronted with the issue by an unemployed 
24yearold university graduate during a campaign stop in reims 
french education the premier told the woman has trained too 
many people in abstract subjects for theoretical jobs 
its too general it does not give the technical expertise our 
businesses demand our enterprises need more and more people with 
technical knowledge 
said bertand the big idea now is alternance going 
alternatively to school then a company for training like in west 
germany to get both theory and experience

they worshipped in village homes at night 
they hid the symbols of their foreign faith inside buddhist altars 
and images these were times when their discovery could mean 
torture or death 
they were japanese who became christians after st francis 
xavier visited japan in 15491551 
today japans christians worship freely but they cherish their 
secret past 
some 13000 of the nations 1 million or so christians continue 
the tradition of secret worship mostly on remote islands in 
southern japan most are the elderly who do so out of habit rather 
than out of fear 
and now artifacts of the secretchristian era many collected by 
a woman who once worshipped secretly herself soon will be 
displayed in a museum here in oiso 
hundreds of thousands of japanese embraced christianity under 
jesuit and roman catholic leadership in the 16th century when 
western influence was first felt in their isolated archipelago 
the government banned what it regarded as a disruptive foreign 
religion after europeans were expelled from japan in 1639 in 
periodic persecutions suspected christians were forced to recant 
or be tortured crucified or burned at the stake 
but christians continued to worship privately for more than 200 
years and during that time japanese christianity acquired a 
unique flavor 
the hundreds of statues and scrolls already collected by the 
museum at oiso attest to the ambiguity of religion in japan where 
adherents to various faiths have customarily mixed christian 
buddhist and shinto rituals to mark the major turning points in 
their lives 
as the christians originally concentrated in kyushu gradually 
spread throughout japan they preserved symbols of their faith in 
hidden ways said shigeru tai the curator of the museums 
collection 
carpenters built crosses into buddhist temples he said 
they worshipped symbols of fish and family crests that were 
shaped like crosses and other japanese didnt guess those were 
also christian symbols 
in one temple the walls were studded with crossshaped 
windows but the buddhist priests had no idea they were made by 
christians 
the secret christians took advantage of this lack of awareness 
and of the close similarity of the christian madonna and the 
buddhist god of mercy they painted on their breasts tiny gold 
crucifixes that apparently passed unnoticed 
the back of one artifact a statue of a japanese warriorgod 
brandishing a spear opens to reveal an ivory and gold crucifix 
other statues have false bottoms with crosses and icons inside 
tai 71 was a close friend of miki sawada the woman who 
collected the treasures and the granddaughter of the founder of the 
mitsubishi industrial empire 
after her death in 1980 tai and others raised the funds for the 
museum on the peaceful forested grounds of the orphanage mrs 
sawada founded in oiso 35 miles southwest of tokyo 
born into a strict buddhist family she learned of christianity 
from a nurse when she was 8 years old and worshipped secretly until 
her 18th birthday when she was allowed to attend a church service 
for the first time 
she eventually married a christian and devoted her life and 
wealth to helping others establishing the elizabeth saunders home 
for orphans the orphanage was named after an impoverished british 
woman living in japan who contributed her life savings 170 to 
help establish it 
for 40 years mrs sawada visited communities where secret 
christians once lived collecting their treasures which are being 
housed in a tiny chapel before the museums opening in april 
these items are priceless said tai gingerly uncovering 
what looks like a metal plate but turns out to be a magic mirror 
there is only one man in japan who can still make these mirrors 
bright light reflected in the rather dull surface of the 16th 
century mirror casts the shadow of christ on the cross to police 
seeking out christians at the time the mirror was just a mirror 
but for the secret worshipers it was a precious symbol of their 
faith 
the prohibition on christianity enforced sporadically was 
lifted when japan reopened its door to the west in 1854 under the 
militaristic governments during world war ii however christianity 
again became suspect 
some secret christians willingly worshipped both buddhist and 
christian deity others forced to demonstrate their piety at 
temples and shrines directed their prayers toward crosses etched 
secretly by other christians into woodwork or hidden behind 
buddhist altars 
when japanese pray at shrines and temples they usually clap 
twice the christians would clap once again the third clap a 
reminder of the holy trinity tai said 
during the war when christianity was considered subversive 
we used to clap the third clap very quietly he said 
christianity however has set down few roots in this syncretic 
nation and today attracts less than 1 percent of japans 121 
million people 
less than half the japanese people profess devotion to any 
faith but japanese life is still dominated by buddhist and shinto 
rites and most homes have buddhist altars for prayers to dead 
family members 
the christians still living in remote villages in southern 
japan who say prayers in an incomprehensible form of pidgin 
japanese are continuing a tradition that is dying elsewhere tai 
said

you cant look at david j colmans book but you 
can read it 
the book on using computers in public relations and related 
fields was written on computer by people contacted via computer 
edited on computer and published on computer 
and since it exists only in the memory of a computer in 
columbus ohio the book can only be read by using a computer 
the essence of the book is to share information on the this 
is how i do it use of technology in the communications arts 
said colmans vice president of an atlanta public relations firm 
colmans is one of about six system operators of a computer 
network called the public relations special interest group along 
with coeditor ron solberg of chicago he has compiled the book 
over about four years 
in it are chapters written by the public information officer for 
kansas city mo who tells how he has set up a computer network to 
tell citizens what is happening in the city discussions of voice 
mail a sophisticated computeroperated telephone answering and 
message system and numerous other aspects of how to use technology 
in the field 
the computer book which would be about an inch thick if 
printed is better than one on paper colmans said because once 
you buy a hardcopy book and put it on the shelf thats it for 
eternity whatevers in the book is the information 
with an online book not only are you not stuck with having 
to have all the information sitting on your shelf but the 
minute something becomes obsolete bang its gone and the minute 
something comes in thats interesting and new in a matter of a 
couple minutes its on line and available for everybody to see 
he said 
the book with the official title of the functional use of 
computers in public relations marketing and advertising is a 
true creature of electronics 
virtually the entire book was brought together through 
electronic mail messages and sharing of text as opposed to voice 
communication colmans said 
there were very few phone calls the book itself was 
created in an electronic communications environment i have met 
face to face about six of the 40 to 50 people that i communicate 
with electronically most of them are just type on a screen to 
me he said 
colmans is not your average computer hacker sitting in front of 
a terminal wrapped up in the nuts and bolts or bits and bytes of 
technology 
about five years ago i started getting interested in 
computers to help me do my work not just to play with because im 
one of those people that cant write a program he said 
i dont know how a computer works any more than i know how a 
television set works but i do know how to turn on a tv and i do 
know how to turn on a computer 
in compiling the book colmans said the big issue that we 
discovered was and still is today that there are so many kinds of 
computers out on the market and theres a real lack of 
understanding among computer users that you can actually get 
those computers to talk to each other 
because the book has not been published in the traditional 
sense colmans earns nothing from the people who use it 
we have not done this project to make money weve done this 
project to share information he said although there has been 
some discussion about publishing a hardcopy of the book in the 
future

allan hendrickse a mixedrace 
politician and member of president p w bothas cabinet defied 
apartheid laws more than a year ago and went swimming at a 
whitesonly beach then at bothas demand he apologized 
doubts immediately arose that the highly regarded hendrickse 
would ever regain credibility among his nonwhite constituents 
but he has made a remarkable comeback 
hendrickse now is recognized as perhaps the only elected 
official in south africa with both the will and the power to defy 
the president 
as leader of parliaments mixedrace chamber he is in a 
position to force bothas national party to the polls next year 
three years earlier than it would like 
botha he needs consent from all three chambers of parliament to 
delay the election from 1989 to 1992 hendrickse whose labor party 
holds 76 of 85 seats in the house of representatives says he wont 
acquiesce unless botha abandons the governments policy of 
segregated neighborhoods 
this demand is unlikely to be met and has resulted in 
hendrickses forced resignation from the cabinet but the 
confrontation appears to have boosted his popularity among the 
countrys 3 million coloreds as mixedrace south africans are 
called 
suddenly a lot of people who were disinterested or 
antagonistic are now realizing that you can find yourself in a 
position of altering the course of history in this country 
hendrickse 60 said at a recent news briefing it does give you 
and the people you represent a feeling of importance 
hendrickses political fortunes have seesawed since he helped 
found the labor party in 1969 
he was detained for two months in 1976 for his antiapartheid 
stance but came under fire from activists in 1984 when the labor 
party agreed to participate in a new tricameral parliament setup 
chambers for asians and coloreds were created to join the dominant 
white chamber although the nations black majority remained 
excluded 
the asian and mixedrace chambers are allowed to handle their 
own affairs deciding to how to allocate public funding for 
their own communities for example but the 1984 constitution gives 
the majority party in the white chamber almost total power to set 
national policy and to override even combined opposition from the 
other chambers 
hendrickse said he would cooperate with the new system for five 
years in an effort to dismantle apartheid from within activists 
nonetheless denounced him as a sellout for joining bothas cabinet 
as minister without portfolio 
our participation within the system must not be construed as 
an acceptance of the system said hendrickse we walk the 
difficult road of being in and yet being out 
in january 1987 the portly politician made a seemingly bold 
challenge of the government by wading into the surf at a 
whitesonly beach in port elizabeth 
botha in a televised speech furiously ordered hendrickse to 
apologize or quit the cabinet hendrickse apologized 
it was a demolition job with such humiliation for rev 
hendrickse that he is unlikely to recover from it peter gastrow 
chairman of the white opposition progressive federal party said at 
the time 
now white liberals applaud hendrickses tougher tactics and are 
considering possible alliances with his labor party 
hendrickse still has many detractors including activists who 
totally reject the tricameral parliament at the university of the 
western cape a leftist predominantly mixedrace school rector 
jakes gerwel said hendrickses resurgence had been a nonevent 
the progovernment media also has been critical for different 
reasons the citizen a johannesburg newspaper maintained that the 
labor party had become fractious and militant after being set 
on a dangerous collision course by hendricske 
hendrickse says he holds no personal animosity toward botha but 
is clearly pleased at having found an effective means of 
challenging him 
its not a question of personal power or strength but rather 
a recognition of the correctness of the decision to participate in 
parliament he said in spite of the constitutional 
inadequacies we were able to find a gap a weakness and thus find 
ourselves in a powerful position 
in addition to his leverage over the election schedule 
hendrickse has blocked a government proposal to begin joint debates 
among the three parliamentary chambers without joint voting and 
other reforms the change is meaningless hendrickse maintains 
regardless of whether the white election is delayed hendrickse 
wants mixedrace elections to proceed as scheduled next year only 
30 percent of colored voters went to the polls in 1984 when 
activists urged a boycott and hendrickse says the turnout next 
year could rise to 50 percent 
he said progovernment forces are seeking to weaken him by 
dividing his party allegations have surfaced that national party 
officials tried to bribe labor party members into deserting him 
there is speculation that botha may retire soon and hendrickse 
has raised an intriguing scenario regarding the choice of a 
successor by the electoral college 
the college consists of 50 national party members 25 labor 
party members and 13 members from the asian chambers majority 
party hendrickse says the asian and mixedrace electors could 
thwart the selection of a hardliner if they could persuade seven or 
more relatively liberal nationalists to join them in electing a 
moderate such as foreign minister roelof pik botha no 
relation to the president 
hendrickse was raised in uitenhage near port elizabeth the 
fifth child of a congregational minister he grew up in an 
integrated neighborhood and became a minister himself 
in 1971 the mixedrace community was forced to move to a 
colored township under terms of the group areas act which mandates 
segregated neighborhoods hendrickse has described his fathers 
anguish as he watched their home and church being destroyed 
now he wants the national party to abolish the group areas act 
and says he has done enough compromising

fourteen candidates of various 
political hues are in the race for venezuelas presidency but 
polls give two centrists the leading edge so far in the campaign 
for decembers balloting 
a former antigovernment guerrilla hopes to become a serious 
third option but the other 11 candidates are given little chance 
one of the centrists is eduardo fernandez who is known as the 
tiger the other is carlos andres perez a former president who 
has been matching practically every every campaign promise 
fernandez has made 
the former guerrilla is teodoro petkoff a socialist 
fernandez and perez represent the two political parties that 
have dominated venezuelan politics since dictator marcos perez 
jimenez was overthrown in 1958 after six years in power 
accion democratica ad the social democratic party now in 
power is fielding perez a 69yearold charismatic leader with 
considerable political experience 
perezs government in 197377 is popularly associated with the 
oilprices boom in 1974 
he is considered to have a slight edge now for the dec 4 
election although the 47yearold fernandez the copei or 
christian democratic party candidate has made inroads by raising 
the issue of electoral reform 
after a shaky start fernandez took the initiative with calls 
for direct elections of state governors rather than by 
presidential appointment and voting for individual congressional 
candidates rather than by party lists 
i dont think there is an electoral system in the entire world 
as primitive as ours fernandez told reporters recently 
according to a recent gaither poll done for perezs ad the 
promise of reform enabled fernandez to narrow the distance between 
him and perez to 11 percent by late january from around 30 percent 
in november 
following fernandezs electoralreforms proposal perez came up 
with one of his own 
i propose to the nation a pact for reform to deepen and open 
our democratic system perez announced at a public celebration 
jan 23 marking the 30th anniversary of the perez jimenezs 
overthrow 
the 10point pact for reform contains proposals almost identical 
to the fernandezs 
the only thing perez has to do now is support my 
candidacy fernandez complained at a recent rally 
the two major parties have staked out electoral bases so broad 
that voters are sometimes hard pressed to see a difference 
fernandez and perez preach political reforms of the democratic 
system but they agree it should stay democratic 
they argue about the degree of state intervention in the 
economy but they agree the state should intervene 
copei a member of the christian democratic organization of 
america is considered somewhat more conservative while ad which 
belongs to the socialist international is more labororiented 
but they are both centrist their members run from conservative 
to liberal but most are somewhere in between 
venezuelas presidency has flipped back and forth between the ad 
and copei five times in the six elections from 1958 to 1983 an ad 
candidate succeeded an ad president only once 
their success in dominating venezuelan politics has relegated 
all the other parties to marginal political roles 
the exguerrilla petkoff is carrying the banner of the 
movimiento al socialismo 
in the 1960s when an indigenous guerrilla movement was active 
petkoff preached a socialism bordering on communism 
but he gave up his fight accepting amnesty offered by the 
government he moderated his views and is now a member of congress 
his party dropped its affiliation with moscow following the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslavakia in 1968 
but even though petkoff started his campaign by trimming his 
bushy moustache and longish hair in an effort to dispel any 
conceptions of radicalism he isnt expected to win much more than 
5 percent of the vote 
that was as much as his party got into 1978 its best year 
the remaining candidates are even worse off they are formally 
in the race but are not making much of a difference 
venezuelas first woman presidential candidate ismenia 
villalba is running on the slogan ismenia take her into your 
heart

india is taking the bullockcart into 
the 21st century 
at least 500 researchers in about a dozen governmentaided 
institutes are at work modernizing the ancient creaking plodding 
carts and even the world bank has donated funds carts of various 
shapes and designs made of plastic and aluminum are being tested 
or have been developed 
there is nothing funny about our project said mittar pal 
dhir director of the road research institute in new delhi for 
us animaldrawn carts are of great importance 
india has an estimated 13 million bullock carts drawn by about 
26 million of the neutered bulls along with 2 million carts pulled 
by water buffaloes camels horses mules and donkeys 
the carts are seen most often in villages where about 640 
million of the indias 800 million people live 
but they also are seen on major highways and an estimated 3 
million plod along city streets often slowing enginepowered 
traffic and infuriating motorists 
bullock carts have even been used to pull mig fighter jets to 
parades and earth satellites to launching pads 
dhir said it would be 50 years before india could eliminate 
animaldrawn carts given their crucial role in indian life 
capital investment in animaldrawn carts is put at 76 billion 
more than 20 million indians earn their living by driving 
renting and repairing the carts 
the figure is striking given the fact that indian railways 
the fourth largest in the world employ only 163 million people 
said rupinder gupta a mechanical engineer for the road research 
institute gupta has designed six types of bullock cart for field 
trials 
each year animaldrawn carts move 144 million tonmiles of 
freight 
dhir estimates that indias animaldrawn carts provide about 40 
million horsepower equal to about 320000 mediumduty trucks used 
in the united states as city delivery vehicles 
without bullock carts india also would have had to import an 
additional 6 million tons of fuel each year it now imports 17 
million tons of crude oil annually 
one of the innovations is the replacement of the carts 
woodenspoke wheels with pneumatic tires 
engineer gupta said carts with pneumatic tires can pull 25 tons 
of weight against the maximum capacity of 15 tons for conventional 
carts 
researchers in the southern state of karnataka also have come up 
with plastic bullock carts and in neighboring andhra pradesh state 
a tire company has produced carts of lightweight aluminum 
another idea behind nonwooden carts is to reduce demand for 
lumber an estimated 165000 mediumsized trees are felled each 
year to make conventional carts 
so you see there is a solid logic behind metal carts said 
gupta 
he listed other reasons for updating the carts 
we want to increase tillage and output reduce damage to roads 
and injury to animals so that the poor animals can have a longer 
lifespan he said 
to protect the animals curved and padded yokes are being 
introduced studies have shown that some draft animals lives are 
cut short by cancerous infections on the neck from unpadded and 
uncurved yokes 
reflectors are being added as another safety feature 
other new fittings are bush bearings castiron springs shock 
absorbers draw bars that adjust for animals of different height 
and mud scrappers 
a fodder box can be put on carts that go long distances 
as for road damage director dhir said the biggest culprit is 
wooden wheels 
in monetary terms the annual damage is to the tune of 7000 
million rupees 538 million to the roads he said 
farmers seem to like the idea of improving bullock carts 
it is an excellent idea said jhandu singh 64 of jharsa a 
village 30 miles south of new delhi 
but this should have had been done 25 years ago we have 
suffered for long and so did the animals 
officials too say the new carts are catching on but this 
itself is creating problems 
we do not have enough new types of carts for all said kalle 
khan project economist of the district rural development agency in 
jharsa whose office received only 16 new carts 
there are more than 200 claimants even some gypsies saw the 
carts and were attracted they wanted at least one i told them no 
these are for farmers 
another reason for high demand is that the government is 
subsidizing the price by about 35 percent 
it is estimated that the largest of the old wooden carts costs 
the equivalent of about 300 newer wooden carts without the 
government subsidy cost 270 to 460 the plastic and aluminum 
carts are 25 percent more expensive

editors note the former mayor of syracuse ny will be 
sentenced this week on charges that he extorted hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from people wanting to do business with the 
city lee alexander a democrat pleaded guilty to the charges 
saying he accepted sole responsibility for what happened 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in his day lee alexander was one of the 
most visible mayors in america a politician who seemed destined 
for bigger things 
now he appears destined for prison 
as mayor of new yorks fifthlargest city alexander had a 
penchant for beautiful women chauffeurdriven limos and 
bodyguards he was a snappy dresser with a deep tan his hair 
always in place 
during his 16 years as mayor alexander a democrat was often 
the spokesman for the nations mayors he served as president of 
the us conference of mayors and six times was elected president 
of the national conference of democratic mayors 
there was talk of a big job in washington speculation that he 
might some day run for governor party leaders made him their 
candidate for the us senate in 1974 but he lost the primary to 
former us attorney general ramsey clark 
now it turns out the man who looked so urbane and polished was 
actually an extortionist using his power to coerce money from 
people wanting to do business with the city of syracuse 
alexanders scheme preyed on architects lawyers engineers and 
insurance agents they paid him up to 25 percent of the cost of the 
project and payments were made in bonds gold coins and cash 
for example an architect paid alexander 125000 for the 
opportunity to work on a project at the citys hancock 
international airport and another paid 25500 for a hospital 
parking garage expansion an insurance agent paid an alexander 
bagman 26200 for a fire policy and a lawyer paid a bagman 2878 
to handle the legal work on a downtown building project 
a lot of people turned down the deals and nothing happened 
said us attorney frederick j scullin alexander was astute 
enough to know where he could put the pressure if someone caved 
in well he kept the pressure on if someone rebuffed him right 
away hed back right up 
by the time alexander left city hall in 1986 he was a 
millionaire 
now he has to pay it all back 
alexander pleaded guilty to charges that he violated federal 
racketeering laws by using his power as mayor to extort money that 
he conspired to obstruct the investigation and that he evaded 
income taxes on his illegal profits 
sentencing is scheduled for march 10 
the federal prosecutor is recommending that alexander be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 100000 scullin said he 
believes that a 10year sentence would be longer than any handed to 
a public corruption figure in the nation 
alexander could have faced 690 years in prison if convicted on 
all 40 counts of the original indictment 
the former mayor has also agreed to return 12 million of his 
illegal profits alexander has said the settlement will leave him 
in worse financial shape than he was in 1970 when he began his 
mayoral career 
some of alexanders bounty was turned over to prosecutors by 
attorneys delivering shopping bags filled with valuable bonds and 
coupons some of the money was banked overseas in such places as 
the bahamas and panama according to scullin 
nine other people who have pleaded guilty to charges stemming 
from the investigation will be sentenced along with alexander 
alexanders undoing started with scullins appointment as us 
attorney for northern new york in 1982 scullin who grew up in 
syracuse and earned his law degree from syracuse university said 
he had heard talk that alexander was crooked 
this thing really began when i first became us attorney 
scullin says there were rumors on the street then about 
alexander being a wheeler and a dealer if not kickbacks then 
there was talk about a lot of conflicts the rumors were pretty 
rampant i decided we should look into it and put them to rest one 
way or another 
at first it was slow going but the investigation persisted 
you keep working and working nibbling away at it developing 
whatever information you can scullin says there was a pattern 
of nobid contracts and professional fees 
we got a couple of breaks we got lucky 
the internal revenue service and the fbi joined scullins 
attorneys in the investigation a witness came forward offering 
information in exchange for immunity that was the crack in the 
dam scullin says 
at its peak alexander was the focus of attention of a team of 
prosecutors 20 fbi agents and another 20 irs agents 
what they came up with was enough evidence to persuade a grand 
jury to indict the mayor 
alexander always seemed on the verge of becoming a political 
heavyweight

in 1976 he passed up an opportunity to be an early supporter of 
jimmy carters presidential campaign to serve as upstate campaign 
coordinator for the illfated campaign of henry jackson 
his extortion scheme was designed to increase his influence with 
national politicians according to scullin 
he wanted to be considered a viable influence on the 
democratic party and make things happen scullin said he could 
get the money where other people could not 
many of the kickbacks alexander arranged were made in the form 
of political contributions to bigtime democrats scullin said new 
york city mayor ed koch gov mario cuomo and massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis were among the recipients 
toward the end he sort of lost track of the political 
contributions scullins said as he could see his star 
dwindling the last three or four years i think he was more 
concerned about lining his own pockets he got greedier and 
greedier as time went on 
opponents were critical of alexanders frequent trips away from 
syracuse saying he was more interested in traveling than tending 
to local problems alexander defended his travels saying he came 
back with federal money for his city 
alexander found an opportunity to get some publicity one day 
when a gunman killed a man then took a pregnant woman and her baby 
hostage in a predominantly black neighborhood holding police off 
for most of the day 
after being held back by police for many hours news 
photographers were suddenly allowed to approach the house the door 
opened and alexander ran out of the house clutching the baby to his 
chest photographs of the mayor carrying the baby to safety were 
displayed by newspapers across the country the next day black 
leaders complained that it was the only time alexander had ever 
visited the neighborhood 
on the local level alexander was a skillful and effective 
politician until alexander came along the republicans dominated 
syracuse and onondaga county politics alexanders campaign not 
only ended a 16year republican rule of the mayors office but led 
the democrats to control of the common council 
not everyone liked alexander when shots were fired at his 
house police were prompted to build a guardhouse outside the home 
city auditor roy bernardi was probably alexanders most vocal 
critic bernardis complaints were aimed mainly at the way the 
mayor did business 
the auditor said he knew then that the city was paying too much 
money for projects and was always doing business with the same 
people 
i noticed a pattern that if not illegal and i had no proof of 
that it was not in the best interest of the city said bernardi 
who is still the city auditor 
ironically while alexander was in power his republican 
opponents who controlled surrounding onondaga county were the 
target of a special prosecutor investigating political corruption 
despite the talk on the street the special prosecutor didnt pay 
much attention to the democrats 
the special prosecutor was appointed by thengov hugh carey a 
democrat to investigate allegations that republicans illegally 
coerced political contributions from public workers the 
investigation netted convictions against several key republicans 
who claimed they were unfairly singled out for activities common in 
politics and also practiced by city hall democrats 
but the crimes of the republicans pale when compared with what 
was going on in alexanders city hall office 
the republicans were convicted of violations of a state law 
prohibiting political fundraising in public buildings and 
misdemeanors juries returned acquittals on the more serious 
charges no republicans went to prison and no democrats were ever 
indicted in that special investigation 
alexander is not talking publicly about his troubles his lawyer 
said after making his guilty plea alexander issued a statement 
saying the city never paid for any services it did not receive 
i accept sole responsibility for what happened alexander 
said in his statement while pursuing the highest standards of 
integrity with respect to the conduct of members of my 
administration i did not apply those same standards to myself 
tom young a democrat is the mayor now and he runs things 
differently instead of personally selecting who does business with 
the city young has contractors submit competitive bids young has 
a panel study the proposals before a contract is awarded 
there are many who still believe alexander was good for syracuse 
i never saw any sign of any wrongdoing says robert visser 
the city clerk who has worked in city hall since 1974 
he did an awful lot of good for the city and eventually the 
good will outweigh the bad if it had not been for the former 
mayor the city of syracuse would not be in the great shape it is 
in today

has happened in between 
uncomfortable sitting with idle hands the tall stately nun 
worked on a knotted prayer rope as she reflected on her 
multifaceted life 
its been different so many times over she says but you 
see one lives day by day doesnt one 
she refuses to compare her royal and religious ways of life 
there is no point she said i did my duty as a princess 
and now im doing my duty as a nun 
her superiors nonetheless are impressed by her example 
as a person as an individual i have admiration because even 
not having a position she could have had a social life which 
would be much more in keeping with other people of her 
background said bishop nathaniel popp 47 head of the romanian 
orthodox episcopate of america 
instead of saying she was a princess who became a nun i think 
it was more she was a nun coming through the life of a princess 
although just a child during the german invasion of world war i 
princess ileana accompanied her mother the queen from hospital to 
hospital administering to romanias wounded and hungry by the 
time world war ii erupted both her parents were dead her older 
brother carol had ascended the throne one sister had become 
queen of yugoslavia and another queen of greece 
princess ileana was living in a castle outside vienna wife of 
an archduke of austria and the mother of six 
afraid of the nazi regime princess ileana and her family moved 
in 1944 to romania there she set up hospitals and did what she 
could for her suffering compatriots 
in december 1947 the king of romania was forced by the 
communists to abdicate and the following week princess ileana and 
the rest of the royal family were exiled 
princess ileana immigrated with her family to switzerland and 
then argentina before settling in 1950 in the united states a move 
that ultimately led to divorce to support her children she sold 
her cherished diamond and sapphire tiara lectured about life 
behind the iron curtain and wrote an autobiography titled i 
live again 
it wasnt until 1961 after her children were grown that the 
52yearold princess became a postulant she ended a second 
marriage to do so 
in my heart she says i always wanted to become a nun 
but there was so much to be done in romania when i was young 
princess ileana took the monastic vows of stability obedience 
poverty and chastity in 1967 and with that profession became 
mother alexandra later that year she put up a trailer on 100 
acres of farmland outside ellwood city and began building an 
englishspeaking monastery for orthodox women of all ethnic 
backgrounds

editors note the society of automotive engineers was founded 
shortly after the turn of the century as a clearinghouse for a free 
exchange of ideas at a time when inventors were making contraptions 
that suited their own tastes just as it set the standards for the 
production of automobiles sae now is proposing interchangeable 
parts for spaceships 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an organization of engineers best known 
by its initials on motor oil cans hopes to do for spaceships what 
it did for automobiles and airplanes 
the society of automotive engineers sae founded in 1905 is a 
global engineering network for the exchange of ideas members have 
included henry ford orville wright harvey firestone thomas 
edison and charles lindbergh 
sae writes standards on such things as what grade of motor oil 
works best in cold temperatures how much reflection comes from a 
taillight lens the process that makes a brake stop a car 
more than 900 standards cover every passenger car 
these standards make sure a product performs in a generally 
expected way they are guideposts by which government and industry 
have measured performance for 83 years in selfpropelled vehicles 
we serve the public by getting the technology out so that 
others can build upon it and use it as a steppingstone without 
having to reinvent the wheel says max e rumbaugh jr executive 
vice president of sae 
sae now has its eyes on the stars 
it created a space standardization advisory committee which met 
for the first time in december for possible standards on 
spaceships sae hopes to work with the national aeronautics and 
space administration on guidelines that would reduce confusion 
eliminate duplication and cut costs 
the space program has been so unique weve been experimenting 
with technology that is one of a kind says arshad hafeez saes 
aerospace engineer 
six of the 25 members on saes exploratory committee are from 
nasa which wants to have a space station in orbit in the next 
decade so it can assemble ships in space among other things 
its getting to the point where some standardization will help 
everybody says dick weinstein manager of engineering standards 
and practices for nasa 
theres enough on the horizon that if we dont do something 
soon we could be in big trouble everybody will be going in a 
different direction 
rumbaugh adds as they start putting things up there like a 
space station youve got to have interchangeability of parts for 
repair and maintenance 
you cant be coming back down here when a light bulb goes out 
and build a new one to take back up standards allow you to reduce 
the cost of manufacturing making one of a kind costs you a 
fortune 
sae has its world headquarters in a threestory red brick 
building about 30 miles north of pittsburgh near the pennsylvania 
turnpike and interstate 79 
with 52000 members in 82 countries it has 25000 technical 
papers on file holds 20 meetings a year publishes two magazines 
and has an engineering library 
none of the volumes will make a bestseller list but they 
titillate engineers 
esoteric titles include the internal combustion engine in 
theory and practice volumes one and two fuel alternatives for 
spark ignition and diesel engines reinforced thermosetting 
plastics for ground vehicle applications the toyota production 
method and human tolerance to impact conditions as related to 
motor vehicle design 
some car manuals are available in spanish french and german 
anyone who pours a can of motor oil can notice the letters sae 
along with numbers corresponding to the viscosity of the oil sae 
standards cover 11 grades of oil with lower numbers performing 
better in lower temperatures 
oil companies voluntarily produce and label their products by 
sae standards 
other sae deeds are less visible 
a lot of the work is sort of boring rumbaugh says we 
dont have a lot of hoopla sae just attempts to get the job done 
oftentimes a job can get done a heck of a lot better before it 
gets a lot of media exposure we prefer to do things before getting 
the hype 
sae was fringhouse for a free exchange of ideas 
at a time when inventors were making contraptions that suited their 
own tastes 
each car still has unique style features but sae standards 
cover such things as ounded as a cleahow much light is emitted by headlamps 
the 
shade of red in a taillight the area of the windshield that should 
be cleared by a wiper and the size of the lug nuts that hold a rim 
onto a wheel 
sae also helped develop the closedin auto body the 
selfstarter that replaced the hand crank the hydraulic brake the 
synchronized transmissions that eliminated gear noises and led to 
the automatic transmission shatterproof glass power steering and 
power brakes 
the american automobile industry has thrived on the principle 
that the exchange of technical information improves society 
rumbaugh says they are less secretive than almost any other 
industry in the world 
william sherman writing in 1980 on the journalists also met with a 
member of what bleibtreu said 
was the contra human rights commission

editors note a boston television reporter took to the streets 
a few years ago and asked dozens of passersby to describe the 
current sky without looking up only one in 10 could do so that 
inspired him to design a skywatching program for schoolchildren 
called for spacious skies that is getting rave reviews from 
many educators 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was a blustery new england morning with a 
cutting wind blowing off boston harbor people were staying inside 
if they could but pat keohane and her firstgraders were up on the 
school roof again looking at the pale winter sky 
whats moving the clouds she asks pointing at a bank of 
cumuli 
the wind reply the kids in an enthusiastic chorus 
theres light blue and dark blue and baby blue over there 
says a little girl her scarf flapping as she stared intently at 
the heavens 
the boy next to her interrupted theres a swordfish with a 
long nose his comments were suddenly lost in a babble of other 
kids voices 
look those clouds look like a sweat suit said one 
i see an upsidedown dragon another giggled 
back at their desks later the children took turns spelling 
skyrelated words in a variation of the classic hangman game doing 
well on big ones like lightning and showers 
a diminutive boy spelled rain and ms keohane asked what 
would happen if we didnt have rain for 100 days 
there would be no flowers and no wildlife one of the pupils 
piped up 
that wouldnt matter said another wed still have water 
in the sinks 
in ms keohanes innercity classroom at the josiah quincy 
school and at about 1400 others across the country teachers say 
that a program called for spacious skies is helping pupils 
academically and emotionally 
some of those involved with the program go even further 
suggesting that sky watching can turn tough innercity kids away 
from drugs and desperation and on to aesthetic beauty instead 
jack borden originator of the program says wherever you are 
you have the sky whether you are living in the high mountains or 
the worst of slums as a matter of fact the person living in the 
worst slums often has access to the most sky 
a study conducted by researchers at harvard universitys 
graduate school of education appears to support some of the 
positive claims made by teachers enthused about sky watching 
using two classrooms at an elementary school in needham a 
community about 15 miles west of boston the study compared pupils 
who participated in for spacious skies in the fall of 1985 and 
again at the end of the school year with those who were not 
encouraged to look at the sky 
the researchers found that the emphasis on looking up followed 
by drawing pictures and writing about the sky significantly 
increased the level of aesthetic sensitivity in visual art and 
literature 
the benefits gained from a program such as this would have a 
great value in any school curriculum the study said 
the program encourages children to keep journals on their 
observations and some of them write poetry and draw pictures said 
researcher liz rosenblatt the fact that kids are exposed to the 
arts in this way helps create an awareness that probably helps the 
increase in their skills 
for spacious skies is named after the familiar first line of 
the katherine lee bates poem set to music by samuel a ward as 
america the beautiful 
borden a quixotic former television reporter believes that we 
cannot spend life looking at our feet his vision came to him about 
10 years ago while working at bostons wbztv 
taking to the street he asked dozens of passersby to describe 
the current sky without looking up only one in 10 could do so

i myself was a nonaware person borden says then i began 
to see that its a good thing to turn people on to the sky 
since that summer day in 1977 borden 59 has formed a 
nonprofit company to distribute for spacious skies teaching 
kits which offer suggestions on how to use the heavens to teach 
just about anything 
for spacious skies is designed to help teach mathematics 
english creative writing music art and science according to 
the preface of a booklet meant for schools in the new england area 
this program just like the new england sky is limitless with 
the sky as a catalyst your students imagination can be challenged 
to its limits 
the kits which are mailed to schools for about 750 include 
guides for teachers on presenting the material they contain tables 
of windchill factors relative humidity and barometric pressure 
songs about the sky and sample observation sheets for students to 
note weather conditions 
donna cataldo a support specialist at josiah quincy outlined 
the different uses of the program at her 830pupil school 
some of the upper classes are keeping charts about the length 
of the day and how that relates to the harvest and growing cycles 
and that brings out social studieswhat are some of the origins 
of feast days and festivals that are based on the length of the 
days and the growing season 
at lower grades kids can do bar graphs of how many sunny days 
there were in january and how many snowy days there 
weremeasuring and counting and a number of interdisciplinary 
skills it allows children to write they might also do a science 
project around wind speed 
gov michael dukakis proclaimed last march 18 for spacious 
skies day in massachusetts 
the american meteorological society honored the program for its 
work in public education a year ago and scheduled presentations on 
for spacious skies at its annual meeting this year at anaheim 
calif 
weather forecasters are bordens key allies in getting the word 
to teachers about sky watching many have mentioned the program 
during their broadcasts and some have gone even further 
incorporating aspects of for spacious skies in weather lectures 
and seminars for children and teachers 
meteorologist bruce schwoegler of bostons wbctv said he was 
amazed at the interest in for spacious skies booklets offered 
on the air to teachers 
i ran a threepart series in our news last march in which we 
offered 3500 teachers guidesand we had a very enthusiastic 
response he said they were all gone within a month 
in pittsburgh weatherman brian sussman of kdkatv said his 
stations booklet giveaway had similar success 
discussing the programs value in tougher innercity schools 
sussman drew parallels between sports and sky watching 
just like athletics has been a vehicle to get kids out of the 
ghetto im looking at for spacious skies as a vehicle for 
sparking interest in a particular field like geography he said 
what im seeing is kids who are interested in something else than 
mtv they for the first time are observing the beauty of nature 
violet witherspoon a disciple of sky watching who teaches the 
thirdgrade at the john marshall elementary school in bostons 
dorchester section expressed similar sentiments 
i told the children you dont need drugs let the sky be 
your drug she said 
they can look at the sky and daydream they dont have to have 
fine clothes they dont have to have fine cars beauty is all 
around them and its free

editors note born in a virginia hill town seka got 
interested in the porn business through her boyfriend who owned 
adult bookstores today shes a legend in the adultfilm industry 
as a performer and as an astute businesswoman 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a porn queen who found her way to the other side 
of the camera is ascending toward the top in a 1 billionayear 
business where many women work but precious few call the shots 
shes a platinum blonde whose stage name is seka at 33 she has 
appeared in more than three dozen hardcore adult films over the 
past decade 
she is still legendary said paul fishbein publisher of 
adult video news magazine when todays generation delves into 
the adultfilm market for the first time she is still the one they 
want to see 
but the big reason for sekas financial success is that she sued 
her manager under federal corruption laws and gained control of her 
name her films and a business that turns annual profits in six 
figures 
dressed demurely in a sweater and slacks and tucked into the 
corner of a dark restaurant seka looks every bit the businesswoman 
she is as chief executive officer of the chicagobased pearl 
productions ltd which sells everything from lighters with her 
logo to panties 
nobody has ever taken care of me seka says 
matteroffactly running a bright pink fingernail through her 
closecropped platinum hair and as long as i look after 
business nobody ever will 
seka she will not disclose her given name was born in the 
virginia hill town of radford where the main industry was an 
arsenal that manufactures dynamite 
she married a factory worker before she finished high school 
but the marriage didnt last long 
all i knew was i wanted to be on my own i wanted to be 
independent she recalled i didnt want to wake up and have 
someone next to me saying fix me coffee and breakfast 
her introduction to the porn industry came during the mid1970s 
through a boyfriend who owned adult bookstores the more she became 
involved in the trade the more she became convinced i could do 
it better 
she worked her way back from the distributors she knew through 
the bookstore business to the moviemakers themselves went to 
california one bright day in 1977 answered an ad for a nude model 
and started working that afternoon 
seka was paid 200 for her first movie a 15minute 8mm film 
many of her early films she made more than two dozen between 
1977 and 1979 were only slightly more memorable although the pay 
scale improved considerably 
she was however just another 23yearold ingenue making adult 
films indistinguishable from dozens of other young women in the de 
rigeur black nylons and garter belts of the times then she met a 
makeup man with big plans it was 1980 and the homevideo market 
was just beginning to heat up 
he made her over bulked her up with weights and vitamins 
changed the way she dressed and managed her business in the 
bargain her new look debuted in 1981 in club magazine and the 
result was booming sales 
yet after what should have been a very profitable rise to the 
top of her profession seka had to hire an attorney simply to look 
at her own books one glimpse and she sued her manager for 
diverting income 
she worked sparingly over the next two years ultimately finding 
herself in 1984 with a handsome settlement and control of a 
potentially lucrative business now that the homevideo market was 
changing the rules of the adultfilm game 
no longer dependent on recovering most of the costs from 
theaters adult filmmaking became an almost riskfree venture 
a handful of pornographers had recognized the homevideo 
markets untapped potential ahead of the major movie studios and 
already were doing landoffice business 
a movie that could be made for as little as 150000 if shot on 
film or 20000 if shot directly onto videotape becomes a 
profitmaker after only moderate sales and rentals 
that meant an adult film had only to sell about 20000 
videocassettes an average wholesale cost of 25 per cassette to 
qualify as a megahit by comparison a major movie studio needs to 
sell 50000 units to approach the same status 
and seka needed only one look to realize that under the new 
economic reality age and overexposure were threatening her main 
asset her body 
so in 1984 she added a copyright attorney to gain control of her 
old material then a contract attorney to make certain she got top 
dollar for whatever new material she released 
she has made just two feature films since then only one has 
been released studied diction and elocution and devoted most of 
her time to mastering business skills computers flow charts 
marketing and the like 
her return to the adultfilm industry as an actress came in a 
big way with the 1986 film careful he may be watching the 
movie which cost about 230000 to make stars seka in a dual role 
as twins one evil one not 
she also conceived the story line developed the script and 
served as producer former porn star actor richard pacheco 
directed making the film something of a trailblazing effort from 
start to finish 
careful won the adult video news awards for best picture and 
best director capped off by sekas induction into the hall of 
fame but she says careful wont begin making money until its 
been on the market for about 2 years 
i can wait she said ive got some projects an exclusive 
magazine deal things i cant talk about in the wings ive even 
been offered the opportunity to be in a major motion picture but 
there were casting couches behind the screen 
at least what i do seka concluded is on the screen

editors note janwillem van de wetering wrote his first book 
at age 40 after years of hopping around the globe and pursuing an 
interest in zen buddhism the dutchborn author who now lives in 
maine was interviewed in new york where he was visiting his 
publisher 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fans of offbeat mysteries set in exotic locales 
dote on dutch author janwillem van de wetering a former amsterdam 
cop who spent two years in a zen buddhist monastery in japan 
but even though his novels often have a zen flavor van de 
wetering says the three heroes of what his publisher calls the 
amsterdam cop series are not followers of the oriental philosophy 
theyve never heard of buddhism or zen says van de 
wetering who now makes his home in maine drawn there first by a 
zen teacher i mention it sometimes in a joking manner because 
its popular with the dutch intelligentsia the police couldnt 
care less they think its all longhaired nonsense 
yet their supercool investigations read like theyre following 
the zen practice of attaining enlightenment by intuitive insight 
beyond intellectual reasoning 
a lot of people do that van de wetering says if you 
cant figure it out then dont try to figure it out but stay with 
it 
van de wetering now 56 wrote his first book when he was 40 it 
was the empty mirror about his experiences in the zen 
monastery 
he has written three childrens books two novels two books 
about zen a biography of dutch diplomatauthor robert van gulik 
and is best known for 12 mysteries most set in amsterdam 
the first mystery van de wetering wrote outsider in 
amsterdam introduced the wonderfully detached commissaris a 
dutch municipal police officer and his underlings in the murder 
brigade adjutant grijpstra and sgt de gier 
originally i wanted to write a realistic book about the 
police van de wetering said during a visit to new york to visit 
his publisher i had been a policeman myself and thought i could 
do it it never came off even at first none of the characters 
wanted to do that 
grijpstra was going to be the nasty guy he immediately became 
sympathetic he is my dutchman my everyman my superego he is not 
into fantasy i intended him to be pretty dumb but he isnt 
de gier turned out to have tremendous energy that everybody 
has as a child and then it gets repressed and organized by society 
with de gier it never got organized he is not in the police for 
any good purpose hes an adventurer hes tremendously curious he 
wants to see what goes on he doesnt necessarily sympathize with 
goodness and frown on evilness 
the only one whos got it all together is the commissaris he 
looks like a gray mouse with his limp but he really is a 
combination of them and goes beyond both of them he is what i 
think a zen master ought to be like the commissaris is convinced 
it doesnt matter what you do but he will always do the nice 
thing 
two of van de weterings mysteries have been made into movies in 
holland contracts for an american movie have been signed for 
hard rain published in 1986 by pantheon ballantine has 
published all the mysteries and the two books about zen in 
paperback 
the author whose name is pronounced yanvillum van de 
vettevin started visiting a zen teacher on the coast of maine in 
the 1960s in 1975 he and his colombian wife juanita settled 
nearby he became disillusioned with the zen teacher but stayed in 
maine because he likes the country his wife took up gardening 
their daughter is married 
we live on 60 acres which is quite normal there he says 
i see my neighbors when i go look for them but too many artists 
hang out in that part of the world we meet each other in endless 
encounters that consume too much time i really have to discipline 
myself when i go to the post office not to lose all day 
the weather is so interesting we all have boats theres a 
big colony of seals and we talk about what they do and what bird is 
coming for the summer or leaving for the winter 
i have very little discipline if i dont want to work i peer 
at the window and hope the dog will come in when i want to work 
ill work through the night and the next day wont go to the post 
office 
van de weterings hobby is making junk sculpture which he 
displays around his property 
i was always frantic about finding certain parts an old man 
said just let it come to you i do that all the time now when i 
turned 50 i was worried about dying i wanted a vehicle to guide 
me across a horse the afternoon i thought of it i went to the 
beach and found legs and ribs a sheet of plywood that was a 
wonderful fit and rope for the tail 
van de wetering learned about the amsterdam police work during 
seven years in the reserve police working mostly nights and 
weekends 
i had to do it because i got accused of dodging the draft i 
left holland when i was 19 and never remembered to come back it 
was kind of a punishment i liked it after four years i could have 
quit 
at 19 van de wetering went to south africa to work then to 
england to study philosophy for a year 
dissatisfied with western philosophy he spent two years in a 
zen monastery in kyoto japan after that he worked for a chemical 
company in colombia in real estate in australia returned to 
amsterdam to take over his uncles wholesale textile business he 
got bored with that sold it after seven years and moved to maine 
he started to write during the seven years in amsterdam 
i always wanted to write he says i couldnt i did bits 
and pieces and articles i read that henry miller started when he 
was 40 i kept the desire alive i started writing when i was 40

mario van peebles making his first real 
venture into television is amazed that producers and network 
executives are listening to his suggestions and putting them on the 
screen 
van peebles stars in the nbc comedyadventure series sonny 
spoon as an unorthodox detective who is part con man part actor 
and regularly slips into other characterizations to get the job 
done 
last year he appeared in about six episodes of nbcs la 
law and won the naacp image award as best supporting actor for 
his role in heartbreak ridge 
brandon tartikoff president of nbc entertainment called him in 
for a meeting and asked him to do a series producer stephen j 
cannell saw a short film he did and wanted to work with him so 
tartikoff cannell and van peebles went to work on the idea of 
sonny spoon 
van peebles suggested some scenes for the show one is that i 
hide out in a baptist church dressed up as a big lady in the 
choir he says then the choral director points to me and i 
have to sing a solo they used my suggestion 
in another show a friend of mine steals some jewels from a 
mobster not knowing hes a mobster when he finds out i dress up 
like a priest and return the jewels 
sonnys like a chameleon he can plug into any character in 
the episode were doing now i go undercover as a white yuppie i 
have blue eyes and blond hair 
its exciting for me as an actor you get to play so many 
different roles i can cross age lines sex lines race lines 
during his lunch break in his trailer which is parked in the 
veterans cemetery in westwood near the campus of ucla he eats a 
quick lunch brought to him by his mother later the company moves 
to wilshire boulevard 
on arrival at the new location van peebles points to a 
bangedup yellow porche carbriolet they wanted to give me a new 
porche he says i said no sonny would drive a car with dents 
in it 
until about two years ago van peebles was working mostly in the 
theater as an actor writer and director he grew up in show 
business as the son of directoractor melvin van peebles 
a short film he wrote directed and played in juliet 
attracted some attention its about a girl who goes through a 
bunch of guys he says i played all the guys cannell saw that 
and wrote some of those characterizations into sonny spoon 
van peebles says that both tartikoff and cannell encouraged his 
suggestions about the show 
to tell the truth i wasnt sure anything would come out of 
it he says thats why i was so bold in speaking up for 
instance i said i didnt want my character to carry a gun i 
called him a finagling humanitarian its like when bugs bunny 
comes up against the tasmanian devil he has to get out of that 
situation on his wits alone 
that makes it a little tougher to write its easy to write 
that a character gets out of a car and pulls a gun its much 
harder to have him suddenly become a hispanic taxi driver 
van peebles got a degree in economics at columbia university and 
went to work as a budget analyst for the city of new york 
i figured if i could do mayor edward kochs budget i could 
do a movie budget he says i thought it was time to get back 
into acting and thought dad would help out i took him to his 
favorite chinese restaurant i said ive got my degree are you 
going to help me out 
he said no he said the restaurant was full of people who 
were waiting for a break it was up to me to go out and make my own 
breaks but mom and dad were very supportive they came to see me 
in every little play i did now i meet some kids of famous people 
who cant do anything on their own

alan ayckbourn may be known as britains most 
prolific comic playwright but the man often billed as an english 
neil simon says his plays are getting darker 
in his 32nd play woman in mind now at offbroadways 
manhattan theater club the author presents a heroine on the brink 
of madness audiences may laugh at first ayckbourn says but he 
hopes the chuckles ultimately catch in the throat 
its an attempt to be a popular play saying something 
serious the 48yearold ayckbourn said the other day in an 
office at londons national theater where he has been in residence 
as a director and a playwright since the fall of 1986 
i stopped calling my plays comedies years and years ago 
says the londonborn writer who began his career as an actor and 
stage manager 
people write and say woman in mind is rather sad at the 
end isnt it and i say well yeah i only said it was a play 
not a comedy 
a rotund engaging man with a low laugh that sometimes swallows 
up his words ayckbourn has made his reputation over two decades by 
chronicling the humors and the horrors of the british lower middle 
class 
while such colleagues as harold pinter and tom stoppard spin 
elegantly phrased dramas out of the mores of the wellheeled 
ayckbourns terrain is the same middle class that makes up his 
audience they are the people he courts and sometimes critiques 
i take the audience by the hand and take them down a path they 
would not normally have gone ayckbourn says 
that audience has remained loyal over two decades since his 
1963 play mr whatnot about a mute piano tuner brought him 
acclaim and an agent the influential margaret ramsey 
according to a 198586 british arts council report ayckbourns 
plays were second that year only to shakespeares in numbers of 
performances given throughout englands regional theaters 
his work is performed in more than 35 countries as far afield as 
uruguay australia and kenya although several have been seen on 
broadway most recently bedroom farce in 1978 he has not yet 
enjoyed a broadway smash 
broadway is the toughest nut to crack of course in the whole 
world ayckbourn said conceding he was preoccupied with the new 
york reception of woman in mind 
i dont know how theyll take it he said of the play which 
casts stockard channing 1985s tonywinning star of joe egg 
as a middleclass englishwoman named susan who seeks refuge from 
her dreary domestic routine in a fantasy world rife with its own 
dangers 
i wanted to get inside somebody elses head really inside it 
and see if i could bring the audience with me ayckbourn says 
i also wanted to say this is what it must be like to have your 
powers of mental perception slipping away from you 
in susans case he continues you suddenly realize shes 
unreliable not deliberately but that her perceptions of what is 
real and what is not are completely false she begins to get 
reality and dream muddled 
woman in mind which had a successful west end production 
starring julia mckenzie is just one recent ayckbourn play that 
looks at the moral and psychological underside of people and their 
society 
in a small family business currently at the national 
theater ayckbourn weaves a tale of ethical decay in which the 
upstanding hero jack mccracken gets sucked into corruption both 
at home and at work 
henceforward which played houstons alley theater last fall 
with george segal and which opens on the west end with ian mckellen 
in november dramatizes a futuristic british society dominated by 
thugs hoodlums and people who have become robots 
its a far cry from the ayckbourn of absurd person singular 
and the norman conquests two hits from the mid1970s which 
showed london and broadway the playwrights clockwork precision 
with a laugh 
does the author sometimes feel that his earlier works were 
written by a different person 
its like looking at an old snapshot and saying i dont 
remember looking like that he said i no longer really 
remember why i wrote them ive just moved on 
he said hes no longer as concerned with craft per se as he once 
was 
when i started it was like a kid discovering hes got 10 
fingers its great to use them all and i use them quite a lot 
said ayckbourn whose works often feature multiple endings some 
decided by coin tosses and chinese boxlike playswithinplays 
once youve done a few of those bravado tricks and shown 
yourself you can do it the technique i hope sinks a little bit 
more recently ayckbourn has had great success as a director 
his production of arthur millers a view from the bridge 
starring michael gambon as eddie carbone ended its acclaimed 
yearlong run on feb 20 
he also directed john fords 1630 verse drama tis pity shes 
a whore at the nationals olivier auditorium rupert graves who 
appeared as the gamekeeper scudder in the film maurice stars 
as the incestuous giovanni 
now its back up north to the yorkshire city of scarborough a 
resort and conference town where ayckbourn is the artistic director 
of the stephen joseph theaterintheround there he will open his 
35th play love of my life 
and whats that like 
he chuckles its a bit lighter

then came a series of jolts starting with a summit meeting in 
october 1986 between gorbachev and reagan in which the leaders came 
close to agreeing on the elimination of all ballistic nuclear 
missiles this stunned west europeans who felt the americans had 
not adequately consulted them on such a proposal which they 
strongly opposed 
from that point it was increasingly clear that major reductions 
in nuclear arms were likely the first step was taken this past 
dec 8 when reagan and gorbachev signed the treaty eliminating 
landbased intermediaterange nuclear missiles representing about 
4 percent of their arsenals 
with the inf treaty as it is called expected to win us 
senate approval within a few months and the superpowers already 
agreed in principle to 50 percent cuts in their longrange or 
strategic nuclear arms nato finds itself facing tough choices 
about adjusting its military posture 
one of the most difficult and immediate choices is whether and 
how to modernize the uscontrolled nuclear weapons that will 
remain in europe after the american cruise and pershing 2 rockets 
are withdrawn 
the gist of the debate is that most nato governments including 
the united states say this upgrading is vitally important while 
most factions in west germanys coalition government strongly 
oppose it 
lord carrington of britain the nato secretary general says the 
alliance must ignore soviet warnings that an upgrading of the 
nuclear arms would inflame the arms race and violate the spirit of 
eastwest disarmament efforts 
if you dont modernize eventually you dont have any nuclear 
weapons which they the soviets would like carrington said in 
an interview 
the west germans have clear reasons for disliking the more than 
2000 nato nuclear weapons that are candidates for modernization 
most of them including artillery bombs and landbased missiles 
are in west germany if fired the likelihood is that many would 
strike only in east or west germany while their nation is divided 
germans still regard themselves historically as one people 
the west german government in bonn wants nato to open 
negotiations with the soviets on reducing shortrange nuclear arms 
those with ranges of less than 500 kilometers 310 miles and not 
covered by the ussoviet treaty the united states france 
britain and other alliance members fear this would play into the 
hands of gorbachev who has said repeatedly that his aim is to rid 
europe of all nuclear weapons 
some european analysts worry that it eventually could be the 
undoing of nato itself 
the reopening of the nuclear issue in germany has the 
potential ultimately to break up the alliance pierre lellouche 
deputy director of the institut francais des relations 
internationales wrote in a recent newspaper column 
from the us viewpoint improvement of nuclear weapons 
remaining in europe is directly linked to the question of whether 
some of the american troops in europe mostly in west germany may 
be pulled out 
the reagan administration has said repeatedly that it opposes 
any troop withdrawals yet us secretary of defense frank carlucci 
said recently that if europe lost its shortrange nuclear arms 
either through negotiation or obsolesence a troop pullout might 
be considered 
americas allies have gotten the message 
under whatever administration comes next in the united states 
there will be more pressure for reducing the american commitment in 
europe said de hoop scheffer the dutch ambassador to nato 
said another nato ambassador speaking privately there is a 
feeling here that despite the best intentions of the current 
administration its only a matter of time before the us troop 
levels are reduced 
manfred woerner the west german defense minister who is due to 
succeed carrington as natos top political officer this summer was 
quoted as saying in a recent newspaper interview that he saw a 
certain evolution in us thinking that raises some questions 
about how long the west europeans can count on the united states to 
keep its troops on the continent 
thats why our european role in nato must reflect our own 
interests he said

a few months ago olga osipov had a good income 
from a prestigious job teaching chinese now she and her family run 
a chinese restaurant and they are 25000 in debt 
but they saw it as an opportunity opened up to them by 
generalsecretary mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms 
perestroika the name given gorbachevs modernization 
program has changed the lives of people like mrs osipov and her 
family and promises to touch millions more as the drive for a more 
efficient soviet economy gathers steam 
the small chinese restaurant run by mrs osipov and her family 
is their own with each member owning a share and getting a share 
of the profits it is officially recognized as a cooperative 
the meikhua also is a model of what soviet authorities had in 
mind when they loosened laws last year to permit cooperatives and 
individual labor such as moonlighting giving soviet citizens an 
official touch of private enterprise 
opened nov 17 the meikhua cafe is the only known familyrun 
chinese restaurant in the whole of the soviet union which shares a 
3000mile border with china 
operating a cooperative gets around a major theoretical hurdle 
because anyone who does not work for himself or for the state is 
thought to be exploited by an employer 
but the meikhua cafe and other cooperatives face difficulties in 
offering alternatives to the staterun economy 
meals in the cooperatives are more expensive than in the 
multitude of staterun restaurants ingredients are hard to come by 
and consumer resistance is high because cooperatives prices 
fluctuate with the market and availability 
among the coops that have sprung up under the new law are 
establishments that produce plastic beach shoes and childrens 
jackets sewn from scraps in armenia others harvest fish pick wild 
berries and repair apartments in the siberian city of kurgan 
moscow has a cooperative extermination service and a cooperative 
that refers callers to other cooperatives about 70 coop 
restaurants have opened in moscow which has a population of nearly 
9 million 
gorbachev told writers and editors in midjanuary that 13000 
coops had been established and more than 300000 people were 
working for themselves within the narrow confines of new 
regulations intended to encourage better supply goods and services 
that in the staterun economy are notoriously slow and of poor 
quality 
this is not particularly many for a country like ours but 
nevertheless a step forward has been made he said 
each new venture must be approved granted a location and 
outfitted by local authorities and the staterun enterprises 
against whom the cooperative competes those who want to start a 
cooperative or work for themselves often report discouraging 
bureaucracy and heavy licensing fees 
but mrs osipov taking a break one recent morning from chopping 
vegetables and meat in the meikhuas kitchen said the bureaucrats 
moved quickly in her case because moscow had no cooperative serving 
chinese food 
that is one indication officials are more interested in 
providing a little variety than in fostering competition 
mrs osipovs son volodya 27 a teacher of english and 
chinese was washing floors and cleaning tables on his day off from 
teaching 
i come at 9 oclock in the morning and dont leave until 11 
oclock at night mrs osipov said and my son hes teaching 
at school from 8 am until 2 pm then when hes done at school 
he comes here by 3 oclock 
we work a lot she said honestly its hard 
main dishes at the meikhua can cost from 290 rubles about 
475 for a pork and cabbage dish to 8 rubles 1325 for braised 
sea slugs a specialty the sea slugs must be marinated for several 
days and take several hours to prepare mrs osipov said 
a fiveounce serving of rice costs 30 kopeks 50 cents a few 
more kopeks brings a pot of jasmine tea 
service at the restaurants nine tables was quick and friendly 
and everything on the menu was available at staterun restaurants 
it often is easier to ask the waiter which of the dishes on the 
menu actually are available and service is notoriously slow 
mrs osipov was born in northeast china of a russian mother and 
chinese father she and her husband cook homestyle food from her 
native region 
volodya and another son a daughter and soninlaw do everthing 
else all but the 49yearold mrs osipov kept their old jobs or 
remained at their studies 
the family would like to hire an extra cook and keep the cafe 
open longer than five hours a day six days a week but their 
intent to keep it essentially a familyrun business fits well 
within the limited scope of the law 
asked if he would prefer to teach or run the cafe volodya said 
i would like if it was possible to be more creative as a 
teacher to work there but it has been very interesting here so 
far to create something is always interesting here its possible 
to govern yourself fully 
the family needed 15000 rubles 25000 to get started and 
friends advanced some of the money to help them turn a former 
twofamily apartment building into a restaurant a bank lent more 
money at 3 percent interest and government organization provided 
the kitchen equipment and furniture 
the cafes income is about 500 rubles about 825 a night 
roughly half of which goes for food heat and electricity family 
members are paid about 250 rubles 413 each a month some 50 
rubles 8250 more than the typical soviet factory worker 
because prices in cooperative restaurants are higher than in 
staterun restaurants some soviets grumble that the cooperatives 
are too expensive for the average citizen 
in a recent article the communist party newspaper pravda 
printed several letters from readers complaining about prices at 
cooperatives 
one letter writer i cherkashin of moscow said cooperatives 
had not forced prices down by providing more competition but had 
driven them up 
who is it that makes the laws on prices the market 
cooperatives or the government he asked 
cooperatives get the bulk of their food from farmers markets 
where prices are unregulated and run substantially higher than 
state markets and stores supply while still uncertain is usually 
better in the farmers markets particularly for fresh fruits and 
vegetables rarely found in moscow during the long winter 
wed like to have a constant supply so we dont have to 
depend on the market volodya said if they are selling meat 
one day for seven rubles a kilogram and the next day for 12 rubles 
our prices jump 
to get the spices she needs for chinese cuisine mrs osipov 
travels occasionally to kirghizia a republic of soviet central 
asia bordering china but some spices she said cost a ruble 
165 a spoonful adding more to the prices on her menu

if an award is given for silliest movie of the year a tigers 
tale is likely to have few serious competitors its not 
offensive not insulting just plain silly 
and its too bad because a lot of the ingredients in this 
romantic comedy had potential for something better ingredient no 
1 is annmargret an actress with so much skill and innate dignity 
that she almost saves the film but not quite 
she is cast as rose butts the divorced mother of a wild 
teenage daughter in a nondescript texas town rose works as a 
nurse by day but spends her nights nursing lonely drunks 
into her bored sad life comes her daughters castoff teenage 
boyfriend bubber who becomes smitten with the mother and wont 
take no for an answer 
thus begins an unlikely maydecember romance between the naive 
19yearold boy and the middleaged mom but once the two begin to 
cuddle no one seems to know what to do next least of all 
scriptwriter peter douglas who also directs 
he diverts our attention to a few subplots theres bubbers 
dilemma over whether to give up his pet tiger valentino the most 
enchanting performer in this flick and theres bubbers widowed 
fathers dilemma over whether to marry again the father a retired 
veterinarian who keeps snakes around the house is portrayed by 
charles durning another gifted actor whose efforts are wasted here 
finally a crisis is created to bring rose and bubber back in 
focus it turns out that her daughter shirley enraged by moms 
unconventional affair has had her revenge when she left to live 
with her father she poked a hole in roses birth control device 
can you guess the result 
the rest of the plot is so preposterous you have to laugh 
it should be mentioned that a major flaw from the outset is the 
lack of even the smallest spark of chemistry between annmargret 
and her teenaged lover c thomas howell a gangly wholesome kid 
with a texas accent who would seem more likely to fall in love with 
a horse 
a tigers tale is rated r for sexual subject matter

concert pianist eugene istomin has loaded his 
steinway on a van and is driving from town to town for his 1988 
tour an unusual way for classical musicians to hit the road 
it hasnt been done this way for 50 years at least istomin 
says paderewski the polish pianist and composer who died in 
1941 had a private railroad car 
there are a lot of places on my tour where socalled big 
name artists dont go the seating capacity of halls is small and 
people cant afford to pay very high fees istomin is accepting 
what he terms reasonable fees 
im playing in a lot of communities which would otherwise not 
hear me on a magnificently prepared superb piano playing a good 
program its giving me a lot of gratification 
from january through may his solo piano recitals are east of 
chicago the western tour will start in september in texas 
istomin whose wife marta is artistic director of the kennedy 
center for performing arts in washington is always on the move 
last fall he played a recital in brussels ate a sandwich in his 
hotelroom at midnight arose at 5 am to fly to paris where he 
boarded the concorde to new york he was met at kennedy airport 
handed a tuxedo taken to rehearsals for the grammy lifetime 
achievement award show and played that night on the televised show 
to honor isaac stern 
you can not perform to your maximum ability doing it this 
way and i didnt he said its the wrong way to do things 
his intention now is to perform by making short hops from town 
to town for a few years or more 
this tour is the right way to do things he said when you 
play it doesnt have to be only for the fancy swells and 
sophisticates the same kind of people who read the same kind of 
books and listen to the same kind of music live in smaller towns 
the tour began at a college in winter park fla with the 
second concert at a senior citizens center outside miami 
istomin has two programs program a includes bach schubert 
beethoven debussy and chopin he has recorded program b for ada a 
french company that releases compact discs he calls it a bit 
more esoteric schumanns first sonata isnt often played it was 
written to murder the hands of pianists its terribly difficult 
and beautifully inspired not the kind of piece you normally take 
on a barnstorming tour 
he also will play debussy and some infrequently heard 
rachmaninoff on program b thats what my pianos really serve 
for istomin said these pieces require a sophisticated brand 
of piano playing i can offer with these instruments 
istomin has been thinking about a tour such as the one hes 
doing for years i started playing at 17 i played 200 concerts 
in my first two seasons i was soloist with the busch chamber 
orchestra paid 250 a week by columbia artists management 
his first of more than 40 recordings was bachs d minor piano 
concerto with the busch players in 1945 
i played concerts with umbrellas stuck under the sounding 
board and keys that wouldnt go down he said i would 
complain people would say hes a nasty young man the good part 
of it was that some very highlevel musicmaking was done i was 
part of it i know we had a lot of success and people enjoyed the 
concerts 
hell probably give 100 concerts this year too i had the 
stamina half a century ago i hope i have it now the artist 
said im 62 i feel like im 26 and hysterical i think i never 
grew up 
the concerts are strenuous but the traveling is easier these 
days cities are not more than 300 miles apart istomin and the 
piano technician drive by car and luggage oes in the van with the 
piano 
i like playing in unpretentious circumstances he said 
pretention is not the same as excellence i think the public 
wherever the town is people who react to and feel what is 
happening to me thats the whole meaning of this trip 
im not warming up for a program in some big hall ive 
already played these pieces in new york and london i want to play 
in winter park fla the way i play in carnegie hall 
sometimes people ask me to sign a program theyve saved 35 
years those people touch me i want to do something really nice 
for those people for whom music really matters 
istomin played at a general motors cancer research award dinner 
in washington in 1981 
they sent me a check for 7000 my regular fee i sent it 
back donating it to sloan kettering institute for cancer research 
they were touched by that and said to let them know if there was 
ever anything they could do for me when i started thinking about 
this tour i thought maybe they would help me 
gm designed a van with a hydraulic lift and temperature 
control to carry istomins piano and is lending it to him free 
the tour itself doesnt have corporate sponsorship

youve heard it before and youll hear it again the success of 
your paint job will depend on how much time and effort you put into 
the preparation 
its nice to see the paint transform your lackluster walls and 
ceilings into gleaming brightness or unblemished freshness but the 
pleasure will disappear quickly if you havent prepared the 
surfaces properly 
proper preparation means freeing the interior of loose dirt 
peeling paint oil and grease it also means spackling all cracks 
and holes with spackling compound or patching plaster the patches 
should be primed before the final coat of paint goes on but read 
the label on the paint can to determine the manner of treatment 
some professionals and many doityourselfers apply a primer 
even when no patching has been done 
it is especially important that any gloss be removed from the 
surfaces since new paint does not adhere well to slick or shiny 
walls and ceilings the gloss can be steelwooled sanded or given 
a coat of a special liquid that dulls the shine unlike a few years 
ago oil and latex paints can be used fairly well over each other 
but a primer will insure an excellent result the assumption is 
that you will be using a good paint since it is poor economy to 
choose a lowquality paint when it is your own elbow grease 
that is being utilized latex paints have little or no odor and 
make it easier to clean up after the job is completed 
follow the ruleofthumb that a high gloss paint usually is more 
washable resists moisture and wears well which is why it is 
preferred in kitchens and bathrooms flat paints are the choice in 
most living rooms and bedrooms being easier on the eyes a 
semigloss paint is what the name implies about halfway between 
the gloss and flat 
the ideal way to prepare a room for painting is to remove 
everything from it but this may be impractical at least take out 
the lighter objects moving the heavier pieces to the center of the 
room and covering them with a dropcloth or whatever is handy 
all electrical switch plates doorknobs etc can be taken off 
but be extra careful about exposing any electric wires ceiling 
fixtures can be dropped slightly to make the painting easier 
in a casual room you might want to try unusual effects there 
are special rollers to give you offbeat results you can do the 
same thing by dragging or swirling brushes whisk brooms sponges 
and rags across the paint while it is still wet keeping in mind 
that easy does it if you want to avoid a mess to find out what 
kind of results these gimmicky styles of painting will produce try 
practicing on something like a piece of scrap wallboard 
when you have estimated the amount of paint you will need its 
a good idea to buy an extra amount for one thing you always find 
something more you want to paint to blend in with the room it may 
be only a bookcase or two but if you have it on hand it can be 
used at some later time for a touchup job 
buying the same kind of paint at a future time does not always 
assure that the shade will be identical with the original 
some people just dont order enough the first time because they 
dont want to pay for unused paint but many paint dealers will 
take back an unopened can if too much time hasnt elapsed should 
you think that might be a problem ask the dealer about the 
possibility 
you may want to get on with the painting and not worry about 
whether you are trying to make a room seem larger or smaller but 
if the latter concerns you the proper color is the answer want to 
make something in a room disappear paint it the same color as 
the room itself want to make it stand out paint it a contrasting 
color 
if a room is long and narrow and you want it to seem a bit 
shorter using white paint on two of the walls and a soft warm 
color on the two end walls will do the trick when a side wall is 
painted white or a cool color the room will appear to be wider in 
the same way a hallway that is too narrow can be made to seem 
wider if a side wall is painted white or cool 
warm colors red yellow redorange yelloworange and 
variations of red make it cool thus theoretically rooms which 
get very little sunlight are best painted warm colors those with 
lots of sunlight cool colors in actuality other factors 
including the shapes of the rooms and their decorative features 
usually affect the choice of colors not to mention personal 
preferences

painting the outside of a house is never easy but theres a 
certain amount of satisfaction in watching the paint work its magic 
but getting the surface ready for the paint is another matter 
caulking cracks countersinking popped nails scraping blistered 
and peeled areas removing mildew priming where necessary and 
performing the other preparatory steps all add up to plain work 
without the visual compensation of the actual painting 
yet you must perform the preliminary phase of the operation with 
some degree of dedication or you will pay for it later 
a house not adequately prepared may look very much the same as 
one that has been given the full treatment but it is only a 
question of time before the difference is seen 
the letsgetitoverwith process begins to peel blister 
check or flake the takeyourtimebutdoitright formula pays 
dividends in the form of a continuous good appearance 
poor paint or the failure to handle the brush roller or spray 
gun properly often gets the blame for what is nothing more than 
inadequate preparation 
if you do not have the time or the inclination to get the house 
ready to paint dont do it 
check on whether the paint you plan to use will work well on the 
kind of surface you are covering oilbased alkyds and 
oilmodified alkyds all are excellent for wood siding but the 
majority of doityourselfers prefer latexes because they have 
blister resistance and since water is the solvent they make 
cleaning up a lot easier 
once regarded as less likely to cover than other paints 
they now have good hiding ability some can be applied even over a 
damp surface read the label on the container to see whether a 
primer is required especially if the latex is being put over an 
oil paint designed to chalk 
if brick or other masonry is being painted be sure you have an 
exterior paint formulated for use on such surfaces oil paints do 
not work well on any material containing cement which has an 
alkali content that attacks the paint 
exterior wood shakes or shingles usually are stained although 
they can be painted once they have been stained they should be 
stained again when a second treatment is necessary while you can 
paint over stain at a later time a careful priming is required to 
prevent bleeding if you paint the first time you cannot stain 
later without removing the paint which can be a messy job on 
shakes or shingles 
when covering this kind of wood when a house is new look over 
the various kinds of stains and pigmented sealers on the market 
manufacturers of some of the pigmented types say they are more 
durable than the clear coatings incidentally you can get finishes 
with mildewcides in them or add a mildewresistant compound to 
other finishes 
as you paint follow the sun that is paint where the sun just 
has been in that way you will not risk having the sun dry out the 
paint too quickly its also a lot more comfortable painting while 
in the shade 
if you are using an extension ladder use it with caution most 
accidents occur when a person leans over too far instead get down 
and move the ladder it may be a little more trouble and take a 
little more time but it will keep you from getting hurt 
work from the top of a house usually in the left hand corner 
and continue downward 
always work in toward the wet paint using wide firm strokes 
dip the brush about halfway and pat off the excess on the side of 
the container if you are using a roller be sure it does not take 
up too much paint and do not spin the roller at the end of a 
stroke with a roller work from a dry area into a wet one 
color changes the seeming appearance of a house if you want 
something to be inconspicuous such as a garage door paint it the 
same color as the main part of the house a house looks smaller 
when it is painted with dark colors light colors of course have 
the opposite effect when a house seems to be too tall paint it 
the same color as the roof if you want it to seem higher paint 
the siding a contrasting color 
if you have been content with the colors on your house over the 
years dont experiment choose the same or nearly the same colors

in painting indoors rollers cover surfaces more quickly and 
easier than brushes but brushes may be necessary for detailed work 
consider the use of edging rollers another possibility is the 
use of extension handles on the rollers so that you can paint the 
ceiling while standing on the floor should you do so remember 
that you will avoid a stiff neck if you paint the ceiling area 
ahead of you rather than directly overhead 
do not overload the roller or apply too much pressure 
and whether using a roller or brush always paint from a dry 
area into a wet one overlapping slightly

editors note the author is editor in chief of greenhouses for 
living an annual buyers guide to residential sunspaces 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a sunspace can transform an ordinary room into an attractive 
bright living space it can also serve as a source of solar heat 
for your home and a place in which you can garden the year round 
basically a sunspace is a lightframe enclosure made of several 
components including glass or other transparent glazing aluminum 
or wood framing windows skylights and sliding glass doors the 
words greenhouse sunspace solarium and sunroom are used 
interchangeably to describe this structure 
preengineered sunspace kits are available in a variety of sizes 
and styles many manufacturers offer standard models suitable for 
most homes budgets and tastes a few offer the ability to give you 
the most exacting custom designs 
standard models come in wood or aluminum they can be further 
classified by the shape of the eave the area where the sunspace 
roof meets the vertical wall which can be either straight or 
curved 
curved eaves have aesthetic and functional importance from a 
stylistic point of view curved glass gives you an unobstructed 
view normally interrupted by the roof edge in a straight eave 
sunspace functionally the curved eave is an aerodynamic shape 
making it more resistant to air leaks during high winds less air 
infiltration means an overall higher energy efficiency 
the greenhouse kits available on the market provide a variety of 
standard options including a range of glazing materials insulated 
panels for the roof endwalls and the basewall of the sunspace 
operable glazed units movable insulation and shading systems 
thermostatically controlled ventilation systems and thermal 
storage accessories 
new technologies and a range of services and components make it 
a greenhouse shoppers paradise these days there are also a 
variety of handbooks and solar construction manuals that offer 
guidance on doityourself sunspace retrofits using 
conventional building materials and offtheshelf components 
however it is recommended that an architect engineer or builder 
be consulted before you undertake any major alterations of your 
home 
there are four major factors that will decide the sunspace right 
for you location use size and cost 
when planning your sunspace start with the factor by which you 
are most constrained and go from there for example if there is 
only one feasible spot for an addition to your house then location 
will be the overriding factor this will in turn affect the use of 
your sunspace for example the degree to which this location is 
facing south will limit your use of this addition as a solar heater 
beside increasing the overall value of your home a solarium can 
be a great solar heater in order to take the best advantage of 
this asset the greenhouse glass should face true south however 
you can build a solarium facing as much as 45 degrees to the east 
or west of south and suffer only a 20 percent loss of winter 
sunshine 
if you have several places on your southfacing wall where your 
solarium can be located there are other considerations which will 
help you determine the best solar heater location if your house is 
l or ushaped try to locate the sunspace so that it is sheltered 
within this shape to limit the heat loss through the endwalls of 
the sunspace 
while todays sunspaces usually perform one of three basic 
functions growing plants solar heating or providing shelter 
the shelter aspects are probably the most intriguing the sunspace 
provides an attractive and sunlit living space that can house a 
myriad of activities 
most sunspaces serve several purposes during the day for 
example a sunspace may have the dual function of collecting and 
storing heat while also providing a place to grow plants in the 
evening you and your family may enjoy it as an informal space 
the warming sunshine streaming into your sunspace at certain 
times can overheat the room and create a costly additional load on 
your air conditioning system shading is one of the best solutions 
to this problem the materials you select to shade your windows 
should be styled to fit the design scheme of your home but must 
also perform well under the additional heat and light to which they 
will be exposed in your sunspace although most conventional window 
treatments such as draperies blinds or shutters can be designed 
for your sunspace the best protection will come from those systems 
that prevent the sun from ever reaching the glass these systems 
include exterior awnings and sunscreens 
interior shading systems are most effective if they incorporate 
a good solarreflecting surface material on the exterior side this 
principle can be applied to traditional fabric shades blinds 
shutters and drapes 
insulated shades are a relatively new development in shading 
systems designed to prevent heat loss in winter and at night and 
also used to reduce summer heat gain the shades are composed of 
reflective liners insulating batting and a decorative interior 
covering hardware includes an edge sealing system which 
dramatically cuts air leakage interior thermal shades are easier 
to operate and maintain than movable exterior insulation and are 
available with motorized and sun sensor controls

people with solariums and greenhouses can be happier and 
healthier than those who dont have a steady supply of outdoor 
light says a physiologist who is also a greenhouse franchisee 
natural daylight is a very beneficial drugless therapy for 
conditions ranging from gloomy moods on cloudy days to colds 
muscular aches and pains and even in some cases migraine 
headaches says ken bondi he operates a four seasons greenhouses 
center in norwich conn 
natural light also provides a healthful environment for people 
who exercise at home he says doing aerobics or lifting 
weights in a solarium or greenhouse addition lets you exercise 
outdoors while staying inside your home 
americans are spending more than 400 million a year to 40000 
new sunspaces on their homes according to lee stanley chairman of 
solar additions inc of greenwich ny he predicts it will grow 
to between 1 billion and 2 billion in the 1990s 
the sunspace has evolved from a greenhouse for indoor plant 
growing into a room central to modern homemaking says stanley 
today people are adding sunspaces for kitchens which once again 
have become a major focus for homemakers 
people are even specifying room addons as bathrooms

if you are remodeling your kitchen and thinking about putting in 
new cabinets you might want to consider giving your old ones a 
facelift instead as a doityourself project it can save you 
money and at the same time get the quality look that you want 
a newly introduced solid oak kitchen cabinet refacing system 
packages contemporarystyled solid oak cabinet doors drawer fronts 
and matching peelandstick oak veneer into a stepbystep 
procedure designed especially for the doityourselfer and one that 
requires no special tools or carpentry skills 
the system offers a variety of cabinet doors and drawer fronts 
to accommodate almost any kitchen cabinet you might have cabinet 
doors and drawer fronts both are threequarters of an inch thick 
with door fronts available in two panel styles cabinet fronts come 
in nine standard door sizes drawer fronts are available in three 
sizes nonstandard door sizes can be adjusted using framing 
strips the refacing system also includes matching peelandstick 
oak veneer for application over all front cabinet frame surfaces 
and exposed ends the veneer features specially formulated 
pressuresensitive adhesive to provide easy application as well as 
durability 
the refacing process is a fourstep procedure that anyone with 
basic doityourself skills can perform installing cabinet doors 
and applying the matching veneer is done as follows 
1 remove all old cabinet doors hinges and catches 
2 match preselected doors with the appropriate cabinet door 
openings 
3 apply peelandstick oak veneer over all old face frames and 
exposed side panels 
4 apply the finish add new hardware and complete the 
installation of the doors 
installing new drawer fronts involves a similar fourstep 
procedure 
1 remove all drawers from cabinets and take off all handles 
knobs or raised moldings it is not necessary to remove the 
existing drawer fronts themselves because the new solid oak ones 
mount over the old ones the replacement drawer fronts come in 
three sizes which will accommodate nearly all drawer sizes 
2 using a hand saw cut off any lip or overhang on your 
existing drawer fronts so that they are flush with the sides top 
and bottom of the drawer 
3 line up the new drawer front so that it centers over the 
trimmed drawer and covers the drawer opening completely 
4 apply the finish then from the face side of the new drawer 
front drill holes so you can attach new drawer handles in most 
instances the screws used to attach the handles will be adequate to 
secure the new drawer front in place complete the installation of 
the drawer fronts 
according to masonite corp which handles the refacing system 
the average kitchen is composed of 15 cabinet doors and 11 drawer 
fronts which take between 16 to 24 hours to reface and finish 
for the relatively few hours involved refacing may be the 
answer for the doityourself enthusiast another advantage is less 
disruption to the normal everyday use of your kitchen while you 
are refacing your cabinets you still have the use of them and 
avoid the mess that comes when you tear out your old ones and 
replace with new ones

most of the time we dont do anything about the roof on the 
house until it does something to us 
when there is a leak or storm damage we move into action 
hiring a professional or attempting a doityourself repair but 
when a roof needs replacement the pro gets the call 
putting down a new roof not only requires knowledge and skill 
it needs the attention of someone who knows how to move about 
safely on high ladders and sloped surfaces 
one way a homeowner can aid his cause is to keep minor damage 
from becoming major check the roof periodically a couple of times 
a year or more often when there is a reason for such an 
examination the check is especially important if the roof is more 
than 15 years old thats the time when a house is a prime 
candidate for reroofing although the life expectancy of a roof can 
be longer than that if top materials are used 
remember that the cost of labor and application is often the 
same regardless of the projected life of the roof 
checking the roof does not involve getting on it you can do it 
from the ground with the aid of binoculars look for signs of wind 
damage cracked curled loose or missing shingles spell trouble 
an excessive loss of granules from the shingles is a sign of wear 
even if you know very little about roofs common sense will tell 
you when something doesnt look right 
resist the temptation to get on the roof to check at close 
range leave that kind of inspection to a roofer 
since you are at the mercy of a roofing contractor to find out 
what is wrong and whether it can be fixed or replaced find one who 
comes well recommended if you are told your roof needs replacing 
get more than one opinion on the problem and what it will cost to 
solve it be sure all contractors are bidding on the same plans and 
materials 
before signing a contract be certain it specifies the work to 
be done and materials to be used completion dates warranties and 
guarantees of both the contractor and manufacturer removal of 
waste materials final price and method of payment 
among available roof coverings asphalt shingles are the most 
widely used roof material they are attractive economical by 
comparison and durable there are endless varieties among them 
the glassbased threedimensional multilayered textured and 
other types there is roll roofing for roofs with little pitch 
builtup roofing aluminum shingles wood shingles and concrete and 
ceramic tiles as well as slate and terne 
your roofer must decide whether your new roof can be applied 
directly over the old one in most cases asphalt shingles can be 
laid over asphalt and wood shingles and some ordinances forbid 
reroofing over two or more layers of shingles no matter what the 
regulations your roofer has to determine whether your roof deck 
can support another set of shingles 
a new roof should require only minimal maintenance but keep 
gutters downspouts and roof surfaces clear of leaves twigs and 
other litter so that water will drain freely and not back up 
never allow water from one roof portion to pour directly on to 
another 
keep trees trimmed to prevent branches from scuffing or other 
damaging the roof 
and for your sake as well as that of the roof stay off it

5 close the choke and remove the air filter assembly clean the 
filter with a stiff paint brush and soap and water or replace it if 
necessary 
6 remove the fuel cap locate the fuel pickline inside the 
tank and fish it out you may want to use an 8inch piece of 
coat hanger that has a u bend at one end replace line or 
filter if dirty and put cap back on the tank 
7 use an allen wrench or screwdriver to remove the starter 
assembly clean filter openings with a rag or brush remove debris 
and replace any worn parts 
8 visually inspect all vibration isolators to be sure they are 
not worn out torn cracked broken or loose check manual for 
exact locations of isolators 
9 check spark plugs arrestor screen for buildup and clean or 
replace if rips or performations are present clean with water or a 
wooden pop stick making sure not to tear holes in the filter 
10 with gloves on grasp muffler to check that it is not loose 
and does not rattle replace if necessary 
when finished double check to make sure all parts have been 
properly replaced all screws and bolts have been tightened and 
there are no pieces left over

keeping kitchen knives razor sharp and in mint condition is an 
art with practice and patience most people can master traditional 
techniques but modern technology also offers simpler and more 
effective solutions to a drawer full of dull blades 
however you choose to sharpen your knives do it frequently 
rather than once or twice a year says chef lou bouchenot 
gourmet and cooking instructor in fact for maximum 
effectiveness knives should be sharpened after every use 
the most popular tool for reviving dull knives is the butchers 
or sharpening steel it is relatively easy to use but does not 
actually sharpen a blade instead it realigns the bent fibers of 
the blade and evens out the edge where they have broken off 
the safest way to steel a blade is by grasping the knife in 
one hand and holding the steel perpendicular to a cutting board 
with the other then position the heel of the blade the part 
closest to the handle at a 20degree angle to the rod of the 
steel just below the handle 
with a quick swinging motion bring the knife down and across 
the steel until the tip reaches the bottom repeat the process with 
the other side of the blade about six strokes on each side should 
complete the job 
the trick to steeling is maintaining the proper angle and 
using a consistent amount of pressure throughout the process 
says buchenot culinary consultant to wilkinson sword inc if 
you dont the edge will be uneven and perhaps too dull or so sharp 
that it will wear away quickly 
an easier and more convenient alternative is a set of 
selfsharpening knives which contains its own automatic sharpening 
cassettes and unlike a steel actually puts a new edge on a knife 
each knifes individual storage compartment contains one of these 
cassettes so that knives are automatically sharpened before and 
after each use 
the cassette works similarly to many popular sharpening tools 
but eliminates all the guesswork it houses two angled 
tungstencarbide sharpening blocks and is scientifically engineered 
to hold the blade at the correct angle as it is sharpened a 
springload mechanism insures consistent pressure throughout the 
process sharpening takes place with one smooth continuous motion 
ensuring an even edge the knives are dishwashersafe and virtually 
maintenancefree sharpening cassettes however may be removed 
from the unit and should be washed occasionally to remove any 
debris 
however if you are a diehard doityourselfer you can try 
your hand at giving traditional knives a new edge yourself with a 
whetstone 
use a medium grade stone to start and finish with a finer grade 
lubricate each with honing oil or a halfandhalf mixture of 
machine oil and kerosene 
to sharpen place the whetstone on a flat surface and hold the 
blade at one end of the stone at a 20degree angle to its surface 
with one smooth motion bring the blade diagonally across the stone 
to the opposite end gradually shifting pressure from the heel to 
tip of the blade 
turn the blade over and repeat the process starting at the other 
end of the stone continue with alternating sides until sharpened 
again maintaining the correct angle and applying consistent 
pressure is important says bouchenot

the federal home loan mortgage corp has 
announced it will begin purchasing a new type of adjustable rate 
mortgage which allows home buyers to convert their loans to 
fixedrate mortgages 
these convertible mortgages have become popular with home buyers 
because they offer the advantage of lower initial rates along with 
the chance to convert to fixedrate mortgages later if rates drop 
the action was announced by leland brendsel president of the 
corporation which is popularly known as freddie mac it follows a 
decision by the federal national mortgage association known as 
fannie mae to purchase convertible mortgages as well 
the two organizations which purchase mortgages from local 
lenders have a major impact on what will be available to home 
buyers because local lenders generally follow their guidelines in 
order to insure that their mortgages can be resold in the secondary 
market 
the freddie mac announcement said it would buy convertible 
mortgages with rates that adjust yearly with caps of 1 percent to 2 
percent on the amount interest rates can change in a single year 
the convertible mortgages must also offer homeowners the option 
of switching from an adjustablerate mortgage to a fixed rate from 
the beginning of the first year of the mortgage to the end of the 
sixth year

baths and kitchens top the list of rooms that homeowners choose 
to remodel says the national kitchen and bath association which 
projects that nearly 10 million consumers will replace one of those 
rooms in 1988 
more than 55 million kitchens were remodeled last year 
according to the association 
both rooms have a high return on investment when it comes time 
to sell a home says francis jones executive director of the 
trade group 
other reasons for what he says is a 14 percent increase over 
last year in the number of people remodeling those rooms include 
more discretionary income and a trend toward staying home a good 
portion of that income is going into home improvements 
particularly the kitchen and bath he says 
consumers want all the options whirlpool tubs steam 
features in their showers ranges with grill features wine 
coolers 
the kitchen in particular may be becoming more personalized 
say kitchen designers who see it as a family activity center 
kitchens are expanding by combining several adjacent family 
areas often spilling over into the great room says david 
hundley marketing manager for wilsonart producers of decorative 
laminate surfacing kitchens are no longer used just for cooking 
but have become areas to socialize do the laundry sew or work at 
the home computer 
kitchens are becoming more practical says a designer 
incorporating several areas into the same space 
the laundry room might be a part of the kitchen concealed 
behind doors a desk area for the family computer a baking center 
equipped with storage space for bulky mixing tools hidden behind 
tambour garages an area for potting plants a place to barbecue or 
even sew says gay fly president of gay fly interiors houston 
among the more popular remodeling plans for kitchens are those 
that remove the walls between the kitchen and family room allowing 
plenty of space for socializing according to richard m rozic 
vice president of builder sales for white consolidated industries 
appliance manufacturers 
the bathroom too is getting more remodeling attention 
according to many manufacturers and designers 
some designers now consider the room a stress reduction 
center complete with exercise equipment sauna whirlpool and 
television set 
oversized and twoperson showers designed with 
multishowerheads and controls are popular large closets and 
utility areas are also showing up says designer fly 
everything is designed to accommodate more than one person in 
the bathroom

the use of vinyl for window frames is growing as an alternative 
to aluminum and wood for home repair and remodeling in the united 
states according to a trade association which says its product has 
grown about 20 percent annually over the last five years 
vinyl window frames account for almost a quarter of the 225 
million replacement windows installed in american homes annually 
says julie cahn executive director of the vinyl window and door 
institute 
some newer replacement windows are combining wood and solid 
vinyl or aluminum 
theres been a design revolution going on the past decade 
within the window industry says k eric ekstrom of the national 
wood window and door association 
whats more consumers are learning all they can about new 
product designs and performance improvements he says new 
design innovations and tougher manufacturing standards have helped 
wood windows or vinly and aluminumclad windows with solid wood 
cores remain one of the most popular materials for replacement

finding a chip gouge or hole on a piece of furniture does not 
mean its ruined damaged furniture can be restored with a patching 
material made just for wood 
most furniture will receive some damage with heavy use chances 
are that furniture bought at a yard sale or auction will have at 
least one chip or gouge 
restoring furniture is simple rewarding and saves money on 
professional repair bills the trick is knowing what materials to 
use and how to do the work 
for your repair work a premixed synthetic compound gives good 
results one kind is made of latex and pulverized wood for a patch 
of maximum workability and woodlike texture 
for generations cabinetmakers made their own patching material 
by mixing hot animal glue or vinyl resin with fine sawdust some 
purists still make their own wood patch substituting woodworkers 
glue for animal glue 
synthetic latex compounds are easy to use you apply them from 
the container with a putty knife or directly into voids from a 
plastic squeeze tube they can be nailed sawed sanded or drilled 
and can be used for repairs both indoors and out 
patching damaged furniture whether unfinished painted or 
stained is easy enough for any doityourselfer 
first to remove dirt grease oil and loose particles from the 
damaged area rub the surface with a lintfree cloth dampened with 
mineral spirits paint thinner or a liquid sander 
wait 30 minutes for the surface to dry then dampen the area to 
be repaired with water water stops the wood from absorbing 
moisture in the latex wood patch otherwise the patching material 
cures too quickly and might shrink and crack 
john molski technical director of united gilsonite 
laboratories scranton pa offers these tips for using a latex 
wood putty 
press the patching material tightly into the void with a putty 
knife fill holes that are less than onequarter inch deep and wide 
in one application make sure the patch is slightly higher than the 
surrounding wood 
wipe off the excess material around the hole with a dampened 
cloth when the patch is dry sand it until its level with the 
surrounding surface 
holes more than onequarter inch deep and wide molski says 
should be filled with several layers of patch let each layer dry 
befre applying the next 
sand the repair using mediumgrade sandpaper attached to a 
sanding block failure to use a sanding block can result in ripples 
on the patch and surrounding wood this is especially true when 
sanding softwoods like pine 
always sand with the wood grain when done wipe the surface 
with a tack cloth or clean rag dampened with mineral spirits to 
remove dust 
the drying time for wood patching products differs read the 
label before sanding painting or staining 
follow normal surface preparations before refinishing the 
damaged area 
a refinishing tip to improve the color match between the latex 
patch and the wood mix some finish with the patching material 
before repairing the damage test the patch on an inconspicuous 
part of the wood the underside of a table for instance to see 
if it blends with the original finish 
if you have trouble matching the patch with a stained surface 
mix a combination of maple mahogany and walnut stain with the 
patching compond with a little work you can match almost any 
stain using these three colors 
do not confuse wood patching products with paste wood fillers 
the fillers are designed for filling the open grains in certain 
hardwoods like oak mahogany and walnut prior to finishing 
hiding minor scratches does not require the use of a wood patch 
for a simple fix rub a wet tea bag or shoe polish on the scratch 
specially designed wax sticks can also be used they are available 
in different colors 
if youre looking for the country look repair major damage such 
as broken legs or rotted wood but leave surface blemishes and 
minor scratches alone these random markings give the piece its 
character

with warm weather coming wood furniture and fixtures will need 
special care advises wood care authority homer formsby 
he offers these tips 
to protect your furniture from the strong summer sun keep 
furniture away from direct sunlight and rearrange your furniture so 
that one piece doesnt receive all the exposure install drapes or 
shades that can be drawn during the suns strongest hours 
to protect furniture from high humidity regularly apply a 
furniture treatment not a furniture polish to replace the woods 
natural moisture dont use linseed oil on wood since it can 
darken mildew and let off an unpleasant odor 
to protect furniture from summer dirt and dust deep clean 
the wood by wiping the surface with mineral spirits or furniture 
cleaner on a cotton cloth repeating until the cloth remains clean 
once the wood is thoroughly cleaned regular use of a furniture 
treatment will clean everyday dirt and pollution 
avoid sitting on wood furniture in a wet bathing suit the 
moisture can become trapped and leave white spots to repair the 
spots first let the furniture sit for 24 hours to see if the 
moisture evaporates on its own if it doesnt buff the area with a 
5050 mixture of toothpaste and baking soda on a damp cotton cloth

the abcs of home insulation usually come down to r 
the letter stands for resistance to heat flow heat gain in the 
summer and heat loss in the winter the higher the rvalue of 
the insulation the greater the insulating power 
determining what rvalue is most effective in your home depends 
on the region and fuel sources for example in kansas city mo 
if youre insulating your attic and the energy source is natural 
gas a minimum rvalue of 30 is recommended by the department of 
energy 
critical areas to be insulated include walls between heated and 
unheated areas basement walls floors above unheated crawl spaces 
and masonry walls in heated crawl spaces 
installing insulation is a relatively simple and inexpensive 
doityourself project says thomas seymour of owenscorning 
fiberglas corp one of the most common homeowner projects 
insulating the attic only costs about 300 to 350 for an average 
1000squarefoot space he says 
to insulate your attic seymour says the only tools 
youll need are a sharp knife a straightedge a measuring tape a 
longsleeved shirt a mask a pair of work gloves and safety 
glasses installation is simply a matter of measuring the area to 
be insulated cutting the material to fit and laying between the 
joists or studs 
the most common types of insulation are fiberglass batts and 
blankets loosefill blownin urethane foam and rigidboard 
fiberglass batt and blanket insulation are the same material 
packaged differently batts are precut in floortoceiling lengths 
and blankets come in rolls that must be cut to length 
loosefill insulation is made of fiberglass rock wool 
vermiculite or other mineral products that are either poured or 
blown into place with a highpressure air nozzle 
according to better homes and gardens building ideas magazine 
the advantage of loosefill is that it seals around plumbing pipes 
and electrical wires and outlets and it can be blown into place 
without tearing out walls but the magazine notes loosefill 
tends to settle and compress over time and can lead to voids in the 
tops of wall cavities 
settlement is not a problem with foams but shrinkage can affect 
the foams airtightness building ideas says

home workshops most often are in basements or garages probably 
the poorest lit areas of the house 
a combination of background and task lighting can alleviate the 
problem and free the work space of glare and shadows says jim 
jensen technical lighting specialist at general electric 
he recommends two 48inch fluorescent tubes centered over the 
front edge of the work bench 48 inches above the work area 
for extra lighting for detail work jensen advises supplementary 
spotlighting a lamp with a 50watt reflector bulb for example 
can be clamped near task areas like vises or drill presses he 
says clampon fixtures are ideal for the workshop because they 
allow you to move the light to areas where it is most needed

power tools make doityourselfing easier and faster but every 
homeowner knows how impossible it is to take care of things around 
the house without various kinds of hand tools 
for most purposes you can get along without an electrical saw 
or a belt sander but here are countless household tasks that 
cannot be handled without a screwdriver or hammer or wrench or 
pliers 
whether you have an organized home workshop or merely a 
collection of tools that grew each time an emergency occurred you 
know well the value of nonelectric implements 
there are some things you should keep in mind when hand tools 
are purchased and used here are a few of them 
hammers a 16ounce nail hammer is best for the novice but it 
should not be used for masonry nails cold chisels or other metal 
for striking the very small hand chisels and punches and for 
riveting shaping and straightening unhardened metal use a 
16ounce ball peen hammer a threepound socalled drilling hammer 
of plastic rubber wood or rawhide is needed if you work with 
surfaces that could be damaged by a metal striking face 
screwdrivers you will need several screwdrivers of different 
sizes while they should be of the standard slotted type it is 
well to own at least one phillips screwdriver which works with 
crossslotted screwheads when possible buy a set of screwdrivers 
rather than one 
wrenches if you can get only one make it an adjustable type 
which has smooth jaws and fits different kinds of nuts but it is 
not intended to replace fixed opening wrenches for many jobs for 
instance never use an adjustable wrench to free a frozen nut 
or for final tightening a wrench should be tightly adjusted to the 
nut and pulled never pushed so the force is on the side of the 
fixed jaw never use an extension or a hammer on any wrench handle 
pliers slipjoint pliers are what you should have if you have 
only a small collection of hand tools their joints allow the jaws 
to be adjusted to two positions later you can buy some of many 
specialty pliers on the market saws the crosscut saw is the one 
you will use most backsaws are for precision work hacksaws are 
for metal very useful is a nest of saws which has three 
narrow blades interchangeable on one handle two of the blades are 
known as keyhold saws the third is for general cutting 
chisels wood chisels are as the name implies for use on 
wood cold chisels are designed for use on metal and usually are 
driven with a heavy hammer 
planes a jack plane is the most common it is 12 to 15 inches 
long and handles most jobs 
files the 12inch size with secondcut or smoothcut teeth 
is the allpurpose file files come in many varieties but the type 
used on wood is called a rasp 
there are of course many other hand tools but you will find 
out about these when you have a need for them in all cases follow 
the rules of safety whenever practical use workmans gloves 
always wear goggles or some other kind of eye protector when 
working with metal or doing anything which may cause chips to fly 
and remember that dull tools cause more accidents than sharp 
ones

farmers at several times higher than an international price and 
then sells it to consumers through retail shops for somewhat

senate agriculture committee chairman patrick 
j leahy is set to raise the curtain on hearings into the problem 
of hunger plaguing the nations homeless and families living in 
poverty 
i know that the budget pressures will remain with us all this 
year and for the foreseeable future the vermont democrat says 
but americas future depends on its children the wealthiest 
most powerful nation in the world must once again resolve to 
eliminate hunger in america 
the hearings set to begin march 1 will come as the government 
prepares to suspend distribution of milk cheese rice and honey to 
lowincome households under the temporary emergency food assistance 
program or tefap because stocks are depleted 
leahy says a report will be released this week dealing 
specifically with the rural poor and that he intends to follow up 
with hearings on the overall extent of hunger in america 
tefap is best known as the program under which poor people were 
able to go to community action centers and other designated places 
in their neighborhoods to receive free allotments of powered milk 
and cheese 
it came into being in 1981 as the reagan administration wrestled 
with enormous surpluses of agricultural commodities and the massive 
storage costs they entailed those huge surpluses have now been 
diminished considerably by price changes under the 1985 farm law 
that have discouraged excess production 
the agriculture department announced feb 12 that dwindling 
stocks will prevent tefap distributions of milk and cheese in may 
rice and honey stocks will be depleted by march distributions usda 
said it said flour cornmeal and butter distributions will 
continue as before 
cheese nonfat dry milk rice and honey distributions will be 
suspended when we have given it all away said john w bode 
assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services 
when we get more we will distribute it 
the department said that one in every seven americans receives 
federal food assistance at some point each year at a taxpayer cost 
of more than 56 million a day it said surplus foods amounting to 
5 billion pounds worth more than 5 billion have been distributed 
under tefap since 1981 
according to figures compiled by the senate agriculture 
committee more than 15 million people have supplemented benefits 
they already receive from the food stamp program with tefab 
commodities 
but the panel says the 18 million people who were taking part in 
the food stamp program as of september represented no more than 60 
percent of those living in poverty 
leahy said he went to new york last week to survey for myself 
the extent of hunger in our nations richest city 
as a senator i have seen poverty in the third world that was 
worse than any i have seen in the united states leahy said in a 
floor speech reporting on his trip but the sense of hopelessness 
that i encountered in the south bronx was as deep as any that i 
have encountered in south america 
he said many families told him they cannot buy enough food 
even with food stamps to feed their children he quoted 
christina walker operator of a food stamp hotline as saying her 
organization receives thousands of calls from households that run 
out of food stamps 
that they run out is not surprising he said the average 
food stamp benefit is around 50 cents per person per meal the 
maximum benefit is 81 cents per meal 
think about what 81 cents worth of groceries would look like 
not much what would happen if you spilled a carton of milk or 
dropped a carton of eggs

first republicbank corp ran fullpage 
advertisements in local newspapers today reiterating that it was 
not involved in merger negotiations and blaming seasonal and 
anticipated factors for its shrinking deposits 
the advertisements seek to reassure depositors of texas largest 
bank holding company which has been plagued by huge losses 
stemming from its portfolio of troubled loans 
during the past few days there have been several articles and 
news stories about the current state of our bank the ad stated 
many of the items reported in these articles have been misleading 
and some just plain wrong consequently we feel it necessary to 
respond to these reports 
since first republicbank reported a 6568 million loss on jan 
19 there have been questions about its ability to weather 
anticipated losses from its 39 billion portfolio of troubled 
loans 
speculation in the financial markets last week sent first 
republicbanks common and preferred shares tumbling and helped 
disrupt its system for raising deposits 
on sunday first republicbank chairman gerald w fronterhouse 
issued a statement denying the reports the company is not 
involved in merger or acquisition discussions with anyone also we 
are not aware that the federal deposit insurance corp is 
negotiating with any other parties regarding our company 
he said the fdic had assured first republicbank that its 
policy is to advise the institution before engaging in such 
negotiations 
the advertisement addresses three points merger rumors deposit 
safety and deposit activity 
there have been several misleading newspaper stories 
concerning our banks recent deposit activity the advertisement 
stated 
through midfebruary the corporations average total deposits 
have only declined by approximately 4 percent this year more than 
half of the reduction was an expected decline in foreign deposits 
with the balance due primarily to normal seasonal factors 
the bank represents only onethird of the corporations total 
deposits fronterhouse said 
the letter encouraged first republicbank customers to call if 
they had further questions

the chairman of allegheny international inc 
says the company will be stronger after it emerges from bankruptcy 
reorganization because of the strength of its consumer products 
business 
oliver s travers said two of allegheny internationals 
subsidiaries sunbeam corp and almetlawnlike inc are profitable 
and would not have had to file for reorganization were it not for 
the parent companys complex financial situation 
he said that including almetlawnlike sunbeams net worth or 
assets minus liabilities is about 400 million 
sunbeam is very healthy as evidenced by its excellent results 
for the first four months of this fiscal year and by its strong 
backlog of orders said travers chairman since 1986 
the pittsburghbased holding company and some of its 
subsidiaries filed saturday in us bankruptcy court for 
protection from its creditors while it reorganizes also included 
in the filing are sunbeam holdings inc and chemetron corp 
greg drahuschak analyst for butcher amp singer said the filing 
announcement was no horrendous surprise 
its probably the best operating move they had given their 
credit situation and the need they had for operating capital he 
said this gets the banks off their backs for a while 
unfortunately the sacrificial lamb in this process is the common 
shareholder 
allegheny international said it has lined up fresh financing of 
175 million from two major new york banks travers said the 
credit line provides enough cash to run the companies during the 
reorganization he said 
chapter 11 provides the means to implement corporate 
restructuring and continue the companys profitable turnaround 
travers said 
the bankruptcy court petition was a key to getting the 
additional money said chief operating officer thomas albani 
while negotiations with the two banks occurred before the 
filing the financing was made afterward legally that puts the 
lenders in a superpriority position ahead of other creditors 
albani said 
the total liabilities of the company and its subsidiaries which 
include such items as payroll and accounts payable as well as bank 
debt are about 845 million its tangible assets are about 735 
million 
total debt alone for the parent company and its subsidiaries 
amounts to 525 million of which 175 million is in shortterm 
bank loans and 350 million is in various longterm commitments 
allegheny international lost about 200 million from 1985 to 
1987 largely due to debt incurred through a spree of acquisitions 
in prior years as well as heavy losses in real estate gas and oil 
and credit operations 
under a new management team since robert buckley resigned under 
pressure in 1986 the company has shed 19 subsidiaries and severely 
cut its corporate overhead 
the efforts bore fruit in the first quarter of fiscal 1988 
which ended dec 31 1987 when the company posted a profit of 
725 million its first in two years 
profits from consumer products amounted to 315 million in the 
quarter compared with 192 million for the same period in 1986 
the filing does not affect sunbeam corps consumer products 
operations in canada mexico venezuela and peru according to the 
company it also does not affect industrial and high technology 
companies that allegheny international is in the process of 
divesting 
allegheny international prior to 1981 was known as allegheny 
ludlum industries the company acquired sunbeam corp that year for 
534 million 
consumer products manufactured by sunbeam includes small 
household appliances electric blankets and barbeque grills 
almetlawnlite manufactures lawn and patio furniture

prohibited by the exchanges rules the wall street journal 
reported in todays editions 
officials at the cftc the federal agency that regulates futures 
exchanges would neither confirm nor deny the report 
the only enforcement action the commission will comment on is 
a publicly filed complaint said kate hathaway a cftc 
spokeswoman 
the case reportedly involving trading at the worlds biggest 
market for us treasury bond futures may be one of the largest 
single instances of alleged futures trading violations 
the journal said the allegations concerned certain trades made 
in the board of trades huge treasury bond futures pit in mid1986 
the traders maintained that the type of trading being investigated 
loosely known as a ginzie trade where a customer gets two 
different prices for portions of the same buy or sell order is 
widespread on futures exchanges the newspaper said 
the cftc notifications are part of a procedure designed to give 
potential defendants a chance to argue to the commission that it 
should not follow its staffs recommendations 
the traders received the notices last wednesday and thrusday and 
were given two weeks to respond with the written arguments to the 
cftc the journal reported

the supreme court on monday rejected an appeal 
by a california investor who said he lost 500000 because of an 
insidertrading scheme 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that excluded 
john olaques of mill valley calif from receiving any money from 
a 78 million settlement of the insidertrading case 
the dispute stems from a proposed merger between santa fe 
international corp and kuwait petroleum co in 1981 
the securities and exchange commission charged that some traders 
in santa fe stock and options benefitted illegally from insider 
information about the deal between sept 21 and oct 1 1981 
the defendants in the case agreed to surrender 78 million in 
profits to some 1900 investors a federal judge approved the 
settlement in 1986 
olaques challenged the settlement arguing that he was excluded 
improperly from recovering 500000 in losses 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled against him last 
may the appeals court upheld a judges decision that olaques did 
not qualify for any money from the settlement because his 
investment took place before the insider trading scheme occurred 
the appeals court said olaques was not entitled to intervene in 
the settlement after it has been approved he should not expect 
to be able to stand aside and watch others incur the expenses of 
lengthy litigation and then upset the results of those efforts 
the appeals court said 
olaques said he was hurt by the insidertrading scheme even 
though he purchased options on sante fe stock before sept 21 
1981 he said the options did not expire until oct 6 1981 
the case is olaques vs sec 87769

for the first time drexel burnham lambert inc 
has acknowledged publicly that the staff of the securities and 
exchange commission has recommended that drexel and some of its 
employees face civil charges 
the investment firm also confirmed it has been under 
investigation by a federal grand jury 
the information is contained in a preliminary prospectus for new 
america high income fund inc a new highyield junk bond fund 
being drexel is underwriting such information routinely is 
required in prospectuses to warn wouldbe investors of potential 
risk 
the document describing the fund was dated feb 16 and mailed to 
investors last week 
it stated drexel had advised the fund about the sec staff 
recomendations for civil actions against the firm and against some 
employees relating to transactions some of which may have 
involved high yield bonds 
no assurance can be given that the results of any such sec 
action or grand jury investigation will not have an adverse effect 
on drexel burnham lambert inc andor the market for high yield 
bonds a market in which drexel burnham lambert inc is an 
important participant the prospectus said 
despite the caveat sales of the fund apparently were unaffected 
on friday its first trading day when it closed unchanged at 10 
per share 
steven s anreder drexels chief spokesman on monday declined 
to comment outside of the information contained in the prospectus 
in january drexel and several ranking employees including 
junkbond chief michael milken reportedly were informed that the 
sec staff had decided to recommend charges of violations of 
security laws 
on jan 27 the wall street journal said the focus of the secs 
investigation of drexel involved possible violations of securities 
laws in corporate takeover situations particularly stock 
parking the hiding of true ownership of stock in someone elses 
name the practice can be used to evade sec reporting requirements 
drexel and the employees have lodged their opposition to the 
decision with the sec but the federal agency had not decided 
whether to proceed according to the prospectus 
the firm previously has acknowledged that an investigation was 
under way but it has maintained that no wrongdoing took place 
the prospectus says drexel has furnished documents to a federal 
grand jury in new york and some employees have appeared before the 
panel 
drexel reportedly has been the object of government scrutiny 
since the breaking of the scandal surrounding former arbitrager 
ivan f boesky because of the firms extensive involvement in 
financing of corporate takeovers involved in the scandal

the supreme court on monday upheld a ruling 
that sharply curtails the power of communities to regulate cable 
television while raising doubts about the constitutionality of a 
key federal law governing cable operations 
separately the justices agreed to hear appeals by the reagan 
administration and coal mining companies trying to block the 
possible award of billions of dollars in black lung disease 
benefits to thousands of miners 
in the cable television case the high court cited a lack of 
jurisdiction in turning away an appeal by palo alto and atherton 
calif which were barred from enforcing public access and other 
rules challenged by cable operator century federal inc 
but the courts action apparently was based on narrow procedural 
grounds and leaves open the possibility of a subsequent appeal 
us district judge eugene f lynch ruled last september that 
cable regulations adopted by the two california cities 
unconstitutionally violated century federals freespeech rights 
the lower court had thrown out regulations requiring the 
company among other things to wire the entire community to make 
service available to all residents and to use a 
stateoftheart system to keep pace with the latest 
technological advances 
lynch who previously had ordered city officials to award an 
operating license to century federal called for further hearings 
to study franchise fee requirements adopted by the cities 
palo alto and atherton officials said the ruling appears to 
declare unconstitutional a 1984 federal law regulating cable tv 
even though the judge did not say in so many words that he was 
invalidating the law 
the reagan administration in a friendofthecourt legal 
brief filed by justice department lawyers urged the high court to 
deny the cities appeal 
in the case involving black lung disease benefits the high 
court said it will review a ruling that the government must reopen 
some previously rejected claims for benefits 
the reagan administration maintains the ruling by the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals if extended nationwide could force 
officials to reexamine 94000 claims at potentially tremendous 
cost to the overburdened fund that pays benefits to miners 
afflicted with the disease 
the lower court had ruled last march that thousands of miners 
seeking the benefits had been unfairly denied a hearing the ruling 
applied to miners with less than 10 years of work in the mines 
whose claims were denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
the appeals court said the us department of labor must take a 
fresh look at the claims under liberalized standards adopted by 
congress in 1977 the appeals court applied the ruling to miners 
who failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or who missed 
deadlines for filing court appeals 
in other businessrelated action monday the supreme court 
agreed to study a key affirmative action issue the power of 
local governments to require minority participation in public works

pan am corp and the union representing 4500 
ground employees in 14 cities remained in a stalemate monday 
following the breakup of their talks and teamster leaders vowed 
guerrilla war against the financially troubled airline 
travel agents reported that some customers have shunned pan am 
flights as a result of the conflict which was sparked after the 
teamsters strike deadline passed at 1201 am sunday 
talks in which management was seeking 35 million in concessions 
from the union broke down sunday afternoon 
no negotiating sessions were held monday the union which 
represents reservation clerks and other ground staff put off a 
strike but teamster leaders threatened to use disruptive tactics 
against pan am which operates pan american world airways a 
northeast corridor air shuttle and other services 
labor unrest also escalated at another major us airline 
flight attendants at minneapolisbased northwest airlines have 
voted overwhelmingly to strike this weekend if a contract dispute 
over wages and benefits is not resolved a union official said 
disclosure of the northwest strike vote came as the two sides 
readied to resume negotiations for the first time since last month 
sources close to pan am who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said they were pessimistic about the prospects for a negotiated 
resolution of the conflict with the teamsters 
we can strike pan am any time we want said william 
genoese director of the teamsters airline division were going 
to pick our strategic time 
in the meantime genoese said theres guerrilla war at all 
the airports the passengers are really going to suffer in this 
situation he said the tactics would include deliberately 
misdirecting baggage and cargo and canceling passengers 
reservations 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said there was no evidence so 
far of such disruptions 
the operation is running smoothly hanlon said there is 
no evidence of any job action of any sort at any station she 
said nothing very dramatic had happened at john f kennedy 
international airport in new york city pan ams major hub 
the company has said it would maintain operations with 
replacement workers in the event of a strike the transport workers 
union at pan am voted friday not to support a teamsters strike 
and pilots flight attendants and flight engineers are not expected 
to honor picket lines 
there havent been any problems whatsoever said archie 
lenzi chairman of the pan am pilots unions master executive 
council noting that he piloted a flight sunday from san francisco 
to new york without incident 
not all travelers appear to be reassured however 
its a very bad situation for everybody said david perlman 
president of dms travel in midtown manhattan some people are 
shying away from pan am flights 
perlman said his agency has been using double bookings as an 
insurance technique for customers booked on pan am flights for 
passengers taking pan am from kennedy airport to europe on monday 
night for example he also booked them on flights offered by other 
airlines to the same destinations 
i think we have to go on the assumption that if there is a 
strike all pan am flights will be shut down perlman said 
james cammisa a travel industry consultant estimates that a 
threatened strike against an airline generally reduces bookings for 
the carrier by about 10 percent to 20 percent 
any kind of strike threat erodes bookings cammisa said 
noting that the same thing has happened with eastern airlines a 
subsidiary of giant texas air corp with a history of labor 
troubles 
the public is very concerned about the turmoil pan am is 
having with their unions said steven hoffenberg chairman of 
towers financial corp the loss of bookings resulting from the 
conflict he said is going to be enough to drain the company and 
put them into bankruptcy 
towers a debtcollection and insurance holding company based in 
new york has said it intends to launch a takeover bid for pan am 
with the teamsters backing towers owns about 100000 pan am 
shares out of a total of around 139 million shares outstanding 
pan am had a net loss last year of 2653 million on revenue of 
29 billion following a 1986 loss of 4628 million on revenue of 
25 billion the company recently signed agreements on more than 
330 million in concessions with the unions representing pilots 
flight engineers and flight attendants pan am also went through a 
major management shakeup a month ago its new chairman thomas g 
plaskett briefly headed continental airlines and also worked at 
american airlines 
the teamsters represent workers at airports in boston detroit 
chicago seattle san francisco san diego los angeles honolulu 
houston washington new york and the florida cities of tampa 
orlando and miami the vast majority of the workers are employed in

first republicbank corp ran fullpage 
advertisements in local newspapers monday blaming shrinking 
deposits on seasonal factors and foreign withdrawals and repeating 
denials that it was involved in merger or bailout negotiations 
in an open letter to customers first republicbank stated that 
recent news reports on the financial condition of the states 
largest bank holding company were wrong or misleading 
the advertisement was aimed at depositors whom the company 
feared might begin withdrawing funds due to the reports because of 
concerns about deposit safety 
during the past few days there have been several articles and 
news stories about the current state of our bank the ad says 
many of the items reported in these articles have been misleading 
and some just plain wrong consequently we feel it necessary to 
respond to these reports 
since first republicbank reported a 6568 million loss jan 19 
rumors have spread about its ability to weather anticipated losses 
from its 39 billion portfolio of troubled loans 
speculation spread to financial markets last week sending first 
republicbanks common and preferred stocks tumbling and disrupting 
its system for raising deposits 
the bank said in a statement sunday that 88 percent of its funds 
come from core deposits gathered through its system of 134 
branches and subsidiary banks at years end first republic had 
193 billion in foreign deposits representing about 75 percent 
of its funds 
total deposits as of dec 31 were about 245 billion according 
to spokeswoman martha larsh assets totaled 332 billion making 
first republicbank the nations 14thlargest bank holding company 
at yearend 1987 
first republic stated it lost slightly more than 11 billion in 
deposits since the end of 1987 first republic chairman gerald 
fronterhouse said about half the withdrawals nearly 550 million 
were at the lead dallas bank 
through midfebruary the corporations average total deposits 
have only declined by approximately 4 percent this year the 
companys ad said more than half of the reduction was an 
expected decline in foreign deposits with the balance due 
primarily to normal seasonal factors 
the wall street journal reported in its monday editions that 
federal regulators were preparing a possible 45 billion rescue 
fronterhouse said in the statement issued sunday that the 
institution was unaware of any efforts by the federal deposit 
insurance corp to arrange an assisted merger for the bank holding 
company the nations 13th largest 
furthermore that agency informed us that its policy is to 
advise the institution before engaging in such negotiations 
fronterhouse said 
an fdic official said the agency would be less than 
responsible if it didnt prepare contingency plans for a troubled 
bank 
first republicbanks ad also addressed the economic condition in 
texas which leads the nation in bank failures 
these are not the best of times for any of us in texas but we 
are totally committed to serving your needs and contributing to 
your success we are here for the long term read the letter 
signed by fronterhouse joseph musolino and charles pistor vice 
chairmen

made it planned to sell a 25 percent share in the merged railroads 
to a limited partnership affiliated with the investment firm morgan 
stanley group inc 
the icc already has approved an expedited schedule for the 
application with a final decision expected in six months rio 
grande said 
the application follows a formal purchase agreement that rio 
grande entered into with santa fe southern pacific corp last year 
the icc ordered santa fe southern to divest either the southern 
pacific or the santa fe railroad

should acquire the southern pacific based on which would serve the 
public interest the best she said they will ask that the icc 
consider whether the bidder helps the competition and also is 
willing to pay a higher price 
ms frank said kcsi should be aided in the icc deliberations by 
having the higher offer 
rio grande officials equally were confident their proposal would 
win icc approval 
we are confident that the commission will find this 
singleline system covering both the southern and central rail 
corridors will enhance competition for the benefit of shippers and 
the public said william holtman rio grande chairman and chief 
executive officer 
tom saunders chairman of the equity fund said the financial 
commitment we are making is the strongest statement possible about 
our confidence in the longterm viability of this venture

common points at ogden utah herrington kan and kansas city 
mo will allow complete connection of the two systems rio grande

dissident investor henley group inc 
proposed monday that santa fe southern pacific corp scrap part of 
its financial restructuring and instead sell 780 million in new 
stock to henley 
the move which would boost henleys stake in chicagobased 
santa fe to 343 percent from 157 percent was expected to receive 
a cool reaction from santa fe which has been fending off henleys 
unwanted overtures since mid1987 
santa fe spokesman robert gehrt said the proposal would be taken 
up at santa fes regularly scheduled board meeting tuesday he 
added there might be a comment after that 
henleys proposal calls for santa fe to stop the planned payment 
of 5 per share in highyield junk bonds for each of its 1573 
million shares on march 1 santa fe already has made a 
25pershare cash payout 
henley has claimed persistently that the payinkind debentures 
would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the 
way they are structured 
instead henley proposed that santa fe sell henley 780 million 
worth of new stock at 1750 per share proceeds from that deal 
would be used to make a onetime 5pershare cash payout to all 
current shareholders 
the proposed deal would mean 446 million new shares for henley 
and would boost santa fes total shares outstanding to 2019 
million 
henley now owns 246 million shares or 157 percent of santa 
fe a railroad land and natural resources concern 
but henley conditioned its proposal on santa fe voiding its 
current poison pill takeover defense that would be triggered if 
any holders stake exceeds 20 percent 
if any hostile suitor exceeds that limit other santa fe 
shareholders would be permitted to buy new stock at half price 
henley repeatedly has criticized santa fes adoption of the 
poison pill last december saying it restricted the ability of 
major holders such as itself and torontobased real estate concern 
olympia amp york developments ltd to maneuver 
in a setback for henley santa fe earlier this month gave two 
seats on its board to officials of olympia amp york in exchange 
olympia amp york agreed to support santa fes restructuring plans 
however in midfebruary olympia amp york launched a surprise 
tender offer to boost its holdings in santa fe to 199 percent from 
its current 105 percent 
olympia amp yorks action has caused speculation that the canadian 
company still intends to push for breakup of santa fe as a means 
of increasing the companys value

on other markets cotton futures collapsed grains and soybeans 
were mostly lower livestock and meat were mixed precious metals 
were mixed and energy futures were lower 
the contract for march delivery of the standard amp poors 500 
stock index gained 390 points to settle at 26685 on the chicago 
mercantile exchange topping the previous postcollapse high of 264 
points set jan 5 
the march contract had rallied above the psychologicially 
important 264point barrier earlier in the session only to fall 
back but the second surge inspired broadbased followthrough 
buying that continued until the close indicating the market had 
potential to move even higher said abbe cocuzza stockindex 
strategist for shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
ms cocuzza speculated the next point of resistance was 274 
points the level at which the march sampp 500 contract opened on 
oct 19 after hitting a low of 28040 in the previous session 
cotton futures prices collapsed on the new york cotton exchange 
in a selloff linked to the impending expiration of the march 
contract 
tuesday marks the first notice day for the march cotton 
contract traders holding long or buy positions rushed to 
liquidate those positions to avoid the possibility of being locked 
into agreements to take physical delivery of cotton on the 
contracts march 9 expiration date analysts said 
the sharp decline in the march contracts price touched off 
computerized sell programs that drove prices on the three nearterm 
contracts down the daily limit and sent prices on other contracts 
to new lifeofcontract lows said ernest simon cotton specialist 
for prudentialbache securities inc 
the contract for march delivery of cotton settled at 6040 cents 
a pound down the 2cent limit 
grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the chicago
