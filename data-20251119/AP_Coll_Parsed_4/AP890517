a general strike called to protest 
the nullified election fizzled wednesday as fear kept most people 
from antagonizing the regime of gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega in his first interview since an election may 7 that was 
later annuled criticized president bushs call for his overthrow 
the panamanian conscience cannot accept appeals from men who 
direct this imperialism he told frances antenne 2 network 
in washington the foreign ministers of the organization of 
american states approved a resolution that held noriega responsible 
for the grave events and abuses in panama including election 
fraud voiding the election results and beating opposition 
candidates 
the foreign ministers also said they would send mediators to 
panama in an effort to end that countrys political crisis through 
a transfer of power 
the strike called by the opposition to protest the annulment of 
the elections was timed to coincide with the emergency oas meeting 
some workers and customers stayed home but many merchants said 
they kept their stores open because of possible retaliation 
we were closed for two months last year and we got nothing out 
of it the crisis got worse said a furniture store owner in the 
capital 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara quickly 
declared the strike a total success but it was far less 
effective than a similar action last year 
frankly im not satisfied with the reaction of the people 
said vice presidential candidate guillermo ford at an afternoon 
press conference i thought people would express their 
dissatisfaction in a harsher way 
the opposition asked the oas to recognize its election victory 
and condemn noriega for the may 10 attacks by noriega supporters 
that injured endara and vice presidential candidates ford and 
ricardo arias calderon 
noriega in the french television interview denied his forces 
beat opposition figures 
the police gave their protection to the candidates i have as 
proof that those who were injured were members of the police 
forces he said showing photographs of what apparently were 
hospitalized policemen 
the failed strike once again raised questions about whether the 
oppositions willingness to fight and to unify is as strong as 
noriegas determination to remain in power 
noriega is willing to die here hell have to be carried out 
of the barracks feet first said one opposition supporter 
like most people interviewed he feared to allow his name to be 
used noriega possesses the real power in panama because he 
commands the panamanian defense forces 
the pronoriega labor party on wednesday afternoon proposed 
negotiations between the opposition the government parties and the 
defense forces 
arias calderon said the government does not have a civilian 
sector and any negotiations must be with the military 
the opposition called for people to demonstrate at noon in their 
own neighborhoods in the capital where onethird of the nations 
25 million people live most neighborhoods were silent however 
most stores and many banks were open although some reported far 
fewer customers than usual shoestore owner angel aguilar reported 
he usually sells 15 pairs by noon but on wednesday sold only one 
in the port city of colon 50 miles north of panama city stores 
in a free trade zone were told they would lose their licenses if 
they closed according to one shopowner 
the government said the strike was illegal because it was called 
for political not economic reasons 
the government also set wednesday rather than monday as a payday 
for government workers 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since two 
federal grand juries in florida indicted him on drug charges last 
year but noriega has withstood economic sanctions and internal 
protests so far 
noriega denies the drug charges and says they are part of a plot 
by the united states to abrogate treaties that turn the panama 
canal over to panama

cuban angolan and south african 
delegates discussing the timetable for independence for namibia 
adjourned their talks early tuesday but will meet again a south 
african general told reporters 
gen jannie geldenhuys gave no details but said we have not 
terminated our discussions and the delegates would consult their 
governments before meeting again 
then he said the talks would resume friday at a location in 
angola to be announced 
geldenhuys was asked about reports that south africa wanted to 
know if the delegations could be certain that all guerrillas 
fighting south african administration of the territory have 
withdrawn 
that is still under discussion and will be pursued friday 
he said 
south africa has said the independence process could be 
endangered if significant numbers of guerrillas of the southwest 
africal peoples organization remain in namibia and do not return 
to their bases in angola 
namibia also known as southwest africa has been administered 
by south africa since world war i 
south africa agreed in december to end its control of the 
territory under a regional peace plan that also requires cuba to 
withdraw its estimated 50000 soldiers from angola the cubans have 
helped angolas marxist government fight the ussupported rebels 
representatives of the three nations along with us and soviet 
observers met monday and early tuesday at a site about 600 yards 
north of the namibian border and near the angolan town of ruacana 
the talks are seen as crucial to the unsponsored plan to make 
namibia independent next year 
the yearlong transition was derailed april 1 the day it began 
when an estimated 1600 swapo guerrillas entered namibia despite an 
agreement that they remain at their bases in angola at least until 
midmay 
south african officials said 316 guerrillas and 27 members of 
the namibian security forces were killed in fighting before swapo 
ordered its men to return to angola 
the joint commission is also expected to discuss a new date for 
swapo rebels to be allowed to enter namibia peacefully some 
officials have said the return originally set for may 15 could 
start may 22 
namibian elections are scheduled to be held in november before 
the annual rainy season that disrupts travel some observers say 
that a significant postponement of the timetable could prevent 
elections before next february after the rains have stopped

a weekend storm that damaged more than 
half of the 190 apache tankkiller helicopters at the armys huge 
base here could wind up costing hundreds of millions of dollars 
lawmakers said tuesday 
rep john p murtha dpa chairman of the house defense 
appropriations committee said the damage could be as much as half 
a billion dollars after touring the base on monday 
army officials here at fort hood the largest armed installation 
in the free world said their first inspections could not determine 
how many of the 134 million helicopters were affected by 
saturdays powerful storm 
the apache one of the armys most modern helicopters is 
designed to take on tanks it can carry 16 laserhoming hellfire 
missiles or 76 rockets and has a 30mm machine gun that can fire 
various kinds of ammunition 
the storm packing howling thunderstorms and 95 mph winds also 
damaged two public schools family housing barracks and other 
equipment 
sen john mccain rariz told phoenix radio station kfyi there 
were indications that more than 100 ah64 apache helicopters out of 
the 190 on the base were damaged 
of those about 35 will require extensive maintenance he 
said from his washington office he said it would be some months 
before those helicopters would be ready to return to service if 
at all 
fort hood is home to the apache training brigade the damage 
forced the base to downgrade its state of aviation readiness said 
army chief of staff gen carl e vuono 
we have flown in a number of teams to make a detailed 
technical assessment vuono said they will decide which 
aircraft can be repaired on site and which will have to be taken to 
a depot for repairs 
the storms knocked over many of the helicopters and bent or 
broke rotor blades said base spokeswoman liz crossan she could 
not say whether any of the aircraft were destroyed or how much of 
the fleet was damaged 
ms crossan said it was impossible to say how many helicopters 
were damaged until inspection teams examine each one because some 
damage might not be immediately visible it was not known how long 
the inspections would take she said 
rep marvin leath dtexas who also toured the base put the 
damage at several hundred million dollars the good news is that 
no one was killed he said 
stu dodge a vice president of apache programs at mcdonnell 
douglas helicopter co in mesa ariz said his company was 
awaiting an army damage report before taking any action 
mcdonnell douglas has delivered about 460 apaches on a contract 
which called for 975 president bush said last month in unveiling 
his defense cuts that the army now wants only 807 168 fewer 
the cutback would trim apache production from the current 10 a 
month to six a month beginning in june 1990 
mcdonnell douglas announced may 2 that it would lay off this 
month 450 temporary and regular employees 355 at mesa and 95 at 
its plant in culver city calif and the same number next year 
because of the cutback

the united states stepped up efforts tuesday 
to safeguard relatives of us military personnel in panama 
offering immediate evacuations for any of the 14000 military 
dependents who may want to leave that troubled country 
the defense department described the escalated effort as a 
cautionary move in light of recent electionrelated violence and 
sought to avoid creating the impression that there was any need for 
panic 
but pentagon officials said that while the program is voluntary 
some relatives ultimately might be ordered home despite their 
wishes 
the first group of 276 american evacuees including state 
department and military families arrived 1045 pm tuesday in 
charleston sc on a chartered commercial airliner others will 
be transported on the military cargo planes that have been ferrying 
extra troops to panama 
the first group of tiredlooking passengers several of them 
carrying infants and small children entered the terminal in 
charleston about 10 minutes later to begin clearance through 
customs 
there are about 14000 military dependents in panama most of 
them already on us military bases the primary objects o the 
evacuation effort are the roughly 3100 americans who have been 
living in panamanian neighborhoods outside us military bases but 
any of the dependents may leave if they wish 
we are working a plan to insure the safety of the military 
dependents to the greatest degree that we possibly can said dan 
howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
the situation in panama has deteriorated further we have 
seen the violence on the streets of panama we are offering a way 
for dependents to return to the us if they so desire we 
think this is a prudent move 
last week when president bush ordered extra troops to panama 
defense officials ordered 1400 offbase dependents to move inside 
the military bases on a temporary basis 
while some of those families can find vacant onbase houses 
most are going to have to come home howard said 
the longterm goal is that they will be in permanent quarters 
on the installations or returned to the continental united states 
by july 1 howard said 
we will certainly exercise the voluntary element to the 
maximum extent that it is feasible but i hope you understand that 
we simply dont have housing accommodations for all these people on 
our military installations in panama he said 
howard refused to characterize tuesdays effort as an 
evacuation suggesting it was a continuation of the defense 
departments practice during the past year of reducing the number 
of military families living off base 
an evacuation at least in my mind creates images of people 
grabbing up whatever they can in the household rushing out the 
front door and getting on an aircraft to get out of the country 
he added this is not an evacuation 
military sources who asked not to be named said they expected at 
least one and possibly two flights would be staged each day for 
military families wishing to leave panama 
howard declined to give details saying they were still being 
formulated 
but he said 110 dependents of either state department or 
pentagon employees had returned to the united states in the last 
few days on a space available basis on military transports 
the pentagon divides the dependents of military personnel into 
two categories command sponsored and noncommandsponsored in 
the case of the former the serviceman has received official 
permission to bring his family with him and normally serves a 
longer tour of duty 
in the latter case the serviceman is serving a shorter 
unaccompanied tour but decides to bring his family anyway at his or 
her own expense 
the roughly 1400 dependents who were ordered on to military 
bases last week were the commandsponsored dependents who must 
honor such directives howard noted that as of last week there 
were another 1685 dependents living off base who were not 
sponsored and thus could only be urged to move on base 
while those dependents cannot be issued orders howard said 
they too were being encouraged to take advantage of the military 
evacuation flights 
howard said the administration stepped up its efforts because of 
the difficulty of forecasting the actions of the government of gen 
manuel antonio noriega who staged and then nullified a popular 
presidential election a week ago when it became clear his candidate 
had lost 
some of the opposition candidates were then attacked during 
rallies prompting president bush to order almost 2000 additional 
troops to panama to ensure the safety of american citizens there 
are already some 10000 troops in panama 
as of tuesday howard said 1269 soldiers or marines had 
arrived in panama out of the 1881 bush ordered south

and family members landed at charleston international airport

and sometimes asking for money 
i just decided to go home and get out and let it settle 
down said debbie strong of washington state who was carrying an 
infant she said her husband is in the army and she works on a base 
in panama 
a second flight is scheduled to arrive late wednesday said air 
force lt lester t carroll jr a spokesman for the 437th military 
airlift wing 
were calling this a hastened withdrawal said army lt col 
bob skinner a defense department spokesman from fort mcpherson 
ga who was at the airport 
an evacuation is mandatory skinner said this is not an 
emergency it is voluntary carroll called the move 
precautionary 
the defense department earlier tuesday offered immediate 
evacuations to any of the 14000 military dependents in panama 
carroll said he did not know how much notice the military 
dependents were given before leaving panama 
he said some passed through charleston on monday on a regularly 
scheduled military charter 
the flights to charleston are regularly scheduled military 
charter flights skinner said 
he said he did not know of any additional flights beyond the one 
scheduled for wednesday night 
however military sources who asked not to be identified said 
they expected at least one and possibly two flights would be staged 
each day for military families wishing to leave panama 
those who arrived tuesday were to spend the night at charleston 
air force base hotels or friends in the area skinner said 
some were expected to take connecting flights out of charleston 
as early as 6 am wednesday

merom golan israeliannexed golan heights ap in a copse of 
trees overlooking the gentle rolling plain dividing the armies of 
israel and syria a memorial has been fashioned from the rubble of 
war artillery shells hunks of rusting guns food tins a helmet 
oh brothers the heroes of golan with your unshaven faces we 
salute you who stood against the enemy tanks you who proved that 
the armor and man are both made of steel reads a poem to 25 
israeli soldiers from battalion 71 brigade 188 they died in some 
of the fiercest tank battles of the 1973 war 
scores of makeshift war memorials along the roads and in the 
abandoned bulletpocked syrian towns and military installations 
give a ghostlike atmosphere to the 700squaremile expanse of the 
golan heights 
israeli experts predict that if there is a new arabisraeli war 
it will be fought on the golan heights a vast slab of basalt 
scored by deep rocky ravines the israeli and syrian forces are 
separated by a thin blue line of 1400 un peacekeepers 
israel seized the 45by16 mile plateau from syria in the 1967 
middle east war and annexed it in 1981 since 1967 about 7000 
israelis have joined the 12000 druse arabs already living in the 
golan heights 
in two wars and countless skirmishes 4900 syrians and 960 
israelis have been killed 
the golan heights is littered with shattered armor and mine 
fields marked off by yellow signs with red triangles there also 
are freshly dug antitank ditches in the grassy fields and modern 
army camps and hilltop lookouts bristle with radar and early 
warning antennae 
in the past year there has been a tremendous amount of 
activity by israel in putting up obstacles in the golan heights 
i have no doubt this will have an important impact on syrian 
decisionmaking concerning the possibility of a surprise attack 
brig gen yosef eyal said in an interview with the weekly army 
magazine bamahane 
senior israeli commanders and independent military analysts see 
syria as posing the only palpable threat from the arab camp 
although their view is that the chances of war with syria are 
minimal at present 
the only concrete enemy at this point is syria the appearance 
of a wider coalition is not realistic at this stage maj gen 
ehud barak deputy chief of staff said in a recent interview on 
israel radio 
in our estimate there is not a strong chance of a total war 
with syria in the next year barak said 
however israeli officials repeatedly point to syrias 
increasing military potential and its stated policy of achieving 
strategic parity or military equality with israel 
they note that syria now has chemical weapons 
surfacetosurface missiles that can reach tel aviv and 
sophisticated artillery with firing computers its attempts to 
purchase the soviet su24 longrange bomber and develop an 
armsmaking industry also are viewed with concern 
israel has responded by introducing a new tank the merkava mark 
3 which was developed to handle the tough golan terrain an army 
film shows the tank plowing through a stone wall and leaping 30 
feet from an embankment at full speed like a motorcycle 
said an israeli an army officer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
if the next war occurs the feeling in the israeli defense 
forces is that it will be on the golan heights the main outlays in 
terms of money and training go to the golan and not to the 
intefadeh or palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
aharon levran a retired israeli brigadier general said syria 
is capable of deploying about twothirds of its military force in 
the golan heights on short notice this would amount to about six 
of its 10 divisions along with about 2000 tanks and 1500 
artillery pieces 
new missiles improved artillery and longrange bombers could 
bring the war into civilian areas for the first time if a conflict 
broke out 
israel has been spoiled by not feeling such strikes in 
previous wars now there has been a strategic change and the 
syrians can now hit israel in depth said levran 
but he said the time was not ripe for syria to begin a war 
because it lacks an arab partner and would not have backing from 
the soviet union its major arms supplier 
all wars in the middle east have involved arab coalitions 
this rule still applies i believe he said

the state department says new restrictions 
imposed by the senate on president bushs plan to coproduce the fsx 
jet fighter with japan may force the renegotiation of parts of the 
agreement 
the senate on tuesday voted 5247 to defeat a bid by sen alan 
dixon dill to scrap the fsx deal 
but it then adopted 7227 an amendment by sen robert c byrd 
dwva to tighten the conditions under which codevelopment and 
coproduction of the new fighter would take place 
deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger made it known 
immediately before the vote that the administration regards the new 
directives as unneccessary and likely to trigger new and lengthy 
negotiations 
the votes came after two days of debate in which senators 
emotionally and angrily denounced japan for allegedly unfair trade 
competition and sounded warnings that the deal could threaten us 
dominance of the aerospace industry by transferring vital 
technology to japanese industry 
it would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting our 
aircraft industry and the vital technologies associated with it 
byrd said this nation needs to get our economic relationship 
with japan on a saner and sounder track 
the amendment was opposed by the administration and senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas dubbed it a killer 
amendment which would require the reopening of negotiations with 
the japanese government 
byrd said the amendment will not torpedo the deal but will 
provide necessary protection for the united states 
roman popadiuk a bush administration spokesman noted the white 
house had made the senate aware of its objections to the byrd 
amendment in advance of the vote and said there would be no further 
comment until its language was carefully considered 
eagleburger in a letter circulated before the senate action 
said additional restrictions imposed by congress would inhibit 
rather than facilitate the fsx program 
he said the terms of the arrangements with japan are already 
consistent with the content of the amendment and do protect us 
security economic and technological strengths and interests 
implementation of additional conditions which would 
require renegotiation in some cases would not materially advance 
these objectives eagleburger said 
the amendment prohibits the transfer of advanced jet engine 
technology to the japanese in byrds words under any 
circumstances 
it would bar the japanese from selling or transferring fsx 
aircraft technology to third parties 
no one expects the japanese to turn this system into an export 
item and this provision simply makes it impermissible for the 
japanese to use the specific systems they are getting from us to 
enter the international market byrd said 
the amendment also expresses the sense of congress that the 
united states receive no less than 40 percent of the production 
work on the aircraft 
byrd complained that the present arrangement calls for 
approximately 40 percent and said that was too vague and too 
liable to result in future squabbles 
during debate on resolution of disapproval senators repeatedly 
accused japan of taking unfair economic advantage of the defense 
umbrella the united states has provided since the end of world war 
ii 
the united states is the very best friend they have ever had 
in their entire history said sen pete domenici rnm we 
provided a safe haven and a safe world that allowed them to 
flourish beyond anything they ever could have done 
but i dont believe it is the action of an ally a friend a 
partner domenici said for the japanese to refuse to buy the 
existing american f16 fighter off the shelf and to insist 
instead on a halfbaked deal to coproduce an entirely new 
fighter using american technology 
dixon called the arrangement a sucker deal and a 
tragically bad deal for america 
we have a 54 billion trade deficit with the japanese and for 
the one area aerospace in which we have a 19 billion trade 
surplus we want to give it to them on a golden platter 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas told his colleagues it will cost 
japan nearly three times as much per plane to coproduce the fsx as 
it would to buy the f16 clearly japan wants whatever technology 
it can acquire so they can build not just an fsx but an aircraft 
industry 
but dole and sen richard lugar rind who led the fight to 
reject the disapproval resolution said the plan is in the 
interests of the united states for what they said are sound 
military and economic reasons 
they said the present plan originally negotiated by former 
president reagan and modified by bush gives japan the advanced 
aircraft it will need to fufill defense roles in the late 1990s and 
also will provide a 25 billion benfit to the united states in 
contracts and jobs

nbc had been in first place for 47 straight weeks in the ac 
nielsen co ratings and added to the honor by taking the top 11 
spots in the rankings the first time a network has done that in 10

average primetime rating of 157 abc whose massive miniseries 
war and remembrance took up much of the week with mediocre 
ratings had an 118 cbs had an 113

rain like wealth is plentiful is some areas 
while other parts of the united states are living handtomouth so 
to speak 
in ohio part of the eastern corn belt that has been drenched 
lately farmers had planted only 13 percent of their corn acreage 
by may 14 compared with 87 percent a year ago and the normal 
midmay progress of 72 percent 
a report by the agriculture department on tuesday following a 
meeting of the departments 1989 drought task force said rain 
continues to delay spring planting in some areas while others 
notably the central and southern great plains still need moisture 
planting is delayed by wet cool weather in eastern corn belt 
delta and east coast areas but is progressing rapidly in western 
great lakes western corn belt and spring wheat areas the report 
said 
iowa minnesota south dakota wisconsin and michigan have 
planted 30 percent to 43 percent of their corn crop north dakota 
montana and minnesota have planted about onethird of their spring 
wheat it added 
the report was issued following a meeting of the departments 
1989 drought task force which is headed by undersecretary richard 
crowder 
winter wheat conditions improved in the pacific northwest and 
northern great plains but deteriorated in the central and southern 
great plains the report said the crop moisture index 
indicates excellent moisture for germination of recently planted 
crops in the great plains great lakes and central corn belt 
the task force noted that the national weather service calls for 
beneficial rains in the great plains and central corn belt in the 
next five to 10 days with favorably drier weather in the eastern 
corn belt 
the outlook through midjune calls for cool wet weather in 
the south and east and warm dry weather from the eastern dakotas 
into the central corn belt the report said 
looking at the livestock situation the report said pasture 
conditions nationally are rated poor to fair but that the 
situation in much of the northern plains is very poor to severe 
cattle slaughter is down 4 percent from a year ago but last 
weeks slaughter figures were the same as at this time last year 
the report said beef cow slaughter was up arouind 60 percent 
in both the central and northern plains however cow prices in 
recent weeks have returned to 1987 levels reflecting the effects 
of increased slaughter 
the task force said that as of may 15 haying and grazing of 
land normally idled during the growing season under acreage 
conservation provisions were open for haying and grazing in 323 
counties of eight states california iowa kansas missouri 
nebraska new mexico north dakota and texas 
emergency feed assistance along with haying and grazing of 
other designated conservation land also has been made available in 
designated counties of the drought areas in all some form of 
special drought aid is available in hundreds of counties in more 
than two dozen states

the agriculture department says a virus called 
abby shows promise of being an effective killer of foliageeating 
gypsy moths 
entomologist martin shapiro of the departments agricultural 
research service said tuesday that once the virus is applied it is 
transmitted to each new generation of moths 
the agency and the forest service plan to field test the abby 
virus this summer in western maryland scientists will count the 
number of dead moth larvae and measure the amount of foliage that 
was protected 
shapiro said that if abby passes the tests the virus could 
become an alternative to either bacillus thuringiensis bacteria or 
diflubenzuron a chemical presently used against the moths by 
keeping them from reaching adulthood 
shapiro who has worked on the virus strain for about seven 
years at the agencys insect pathology laboratory in beltsville 
md named the new virus abby after the town where it was found 
abington mass 
the abby virus showed up early in the studies as one of the most 
effective of 19 different strains of nuclear polyhdrosis virus or 
npv around the world the npv strains infect gypsy caterpillars 
but may not always prevent them from defoliating trees 
but shapiro said the abby virus showed in laboratory tests that 
it can kill more caterpillars 10 times faster than the standard 
npv which has been used for two years by the national park service 
in selected areas of rock creek park in washington dc 
park officials said that wherever npv was sprayed there was 
little or no defoliation to the trees shapiro said and that 
was the natural strain not abby 
gypsy moths in the caterpillar or larvae stage are voracious 
eaters of foliage and have gradually spread from massachusetts 
where they were imported in 1969 by a french biologist to breed 
with native american silkworms 
but the moths escaped from the laboratory and started eating 
foliage the scientist louis trouvellot returned to france and 
pursued a career in astronomy

robert c clark once planned to be a 
priest now the professor who wrote the book on corporate law is 
accepting a task some regard as sacred shepherding harvard law 
school 
the 44yearold clark takes over july 1 as the schools new 
dean succeeding 61yearold james vorenberg who wanted to return 
to teaching 
a political conservative clark will be in various ways 
responsible for and to 1700 students 65 faculty members 365 
employees and 25000 alumni he has been a professor at the school 
since 1978 
we have a responsiblity to give the best education and instill 
some important values he said in a recent interview the most 
important thing is the simplest things lawyers should be 
scrupulously honest 
thats not a foregone conclusion people are tempted in many 
ways throughout their careers its very important for all of our 
graduates to feel they owe something to society that theyre 
privileged and they ought to pay back 
clark also wants to increase the faculty by 10 adding a couple 
of new teachers a year hold a major fundraising drive and boost 
morale 
im not just interested in things being ok he said i 
want people to think theyre part of the greatest law school 
around so that they do their best 
clark has degrees from maryknoll seminary columbia university 
and harvard law school his book corporate law is regarded as 
a leading textbook on the subject 
much has been made of clarks outspoken dislike for critical 
legal studies a movement of lawyers at harvard and elsewhere who 
contend that the american legal system is not as neutral as it is 
purported to be they say it entrenches the power of a largely 
white male uppermiddle class 
clark has blamed conflicts over critical legal studiesleaning 
faculty for lowering the quality of the teaching staff when he was 
named dean in february the wall street journal cheered with an 
editorial mr clarks appointment signals that harvard wants the 
law schools flirtation with radical politics to come to a 
screeching halt today clark calls the issue old hat 
the divisions are greatly exaggerated the relationships are 
changing he said 
faculty proponents of critical legal studies said they didnt 
want to comment on clarks appointment but international law 
professor david kennedy a selfdescribed progressive said faculty 
reaction to clarks appointment ranges from anxiety to 
waitandsee 
since he was announced hes taken in general a more 
moderate position on issues of diversity than he did before 
kennedy said hes been an ardent opponent of critical legal 
studies for more than a decade but i dont expect him to do 
anything evil to cls hes a very nice guy

weaker nations that have obtained technically 
advanced ballistic missiles pose an increasing threat to their 
powerful neighbors the editors of janes strategic weapon 
systems warn 
the past few years have seen the number of missilecapable 
nations increase editors duncan lennox and roger loasby wrote in 
the first edition of the book which was published tuesday 
this was not too important when the weapons concerned were 
shortrange and relatively inaccurate but increasingly the trend 
has been for longer range and more accurate missiles 
the book says that in the past 12 months a chinese missile 
known as the css2 with a range of about 930 miles has been sold 
to middle east countries which also have soviet technology 
reports also surfaced that those countries are negotiating to 
acquire the more advanced m family of chinese missiles the 
book says 
in some instances missile acquisitions are combined with a 
probable capability to provide nuclear warheads and once this 
happens the whole thrust of denuclearization within the existing 
nuclear powers is blunted the editors said 
they said shortrange ballistic missiles are being developed or 
are owned by at least 16 countries outside nato and the warsaw 
pact including argentina brazil india egypt north korea south 
yemen and taiwan 
they said it is not clear whether any of the missiles being 
developed or sold outside the big five nuclear powers the united 
states the soviet union britain france and china are being 
armed with nuclear warheads 
they noted however the last report by the international atomic 
energy agency suggested that a further eight countries have the 
capability to manufacture nuclear warheads argentina colombia 
india israel north korea pakistan south africa and vietnam 
the book says there also is a further proliferation of 
stationing ballistic and cruise missiles on ships and submarines 
the dangers and vulnerabilities are obvious previously safe 
deployments of ships to trouble spots around the world could in the 
future be threatened by such forces in the hands of smaller 
nations the editors wrote 
with the improved accuracies and lethality of some 
conventional warheads all nations should be aware of the changing 
threat 
lennox and loasby predict that space will be used in any future 
confrontation not only between the superpowers but also smaller 
nations 
the scope for intelligencegathering monitoring of events 
navigation meteorological datagathering global communications 
and perhaps the eventual positioning of defensive and offensive 
weapons in space makes it essential for any nation planning to 
defend itself to be involved in military space research they 
wrote

like other information in the soviet union 
the national census is being partially released under the new 
policy of openness and the early figures provide rich veins to be 
mined by scholars like murray feshbach 
we used to complain that we did not have enough information 
now we complain that we have too much said feshbach interviewed 
amid the mountains of soviet documents at his georgetown university 
office 
but even under kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev there is a 
lot missing said feshbach and the quality of a lot of the 
information is up for grabs 
feshbach experienced one of the high points in his career in 
late january when he was allowed to accompany a moscow 
censustaker he proudly shows off a pin and card designating him 
an official soviet censustaker 
with this i could ride on the metro and bus for free but for 
five kopeks i was a big spender says feshbach 
feshbach knows as much about soviet statistics as virtually 
anyone in this country or the soviet union the government calls 
frequently on his expertise and he was to testify on capitol hill 
today on social change under gorbachev 
his experience as a moscow censustaker taught him the soviets 
are very likely to publish the figures in a more truthful 
fashion than after the previous census in 1979 the results of 
that census dribbled out with major gaps 
allowing feshbach to observe data collection was an indication 
of rising soviet candor as was an incident at one moscow apartment 
he visited with a censustaker 
grandma could not read the card that asked her to point out 
her source of income there was a long embarrassing pause said 
feshbach 
but her daughter had a higher education having completed a 
fiveyear course in engineering and economics thats a tribute 
to what the soviets have accomplished said feshbach 
preliminary census results are in and have joined the stacks of 
documents piled in feshbachs office the 1989 data contain bad 
news for the kremlin 
the population of the moslem republics of central asia where 
there is little industry and lots of underemployment continued to 
grow at a much faster pace than the slavic republics where workers 
are needed russia grew by 7 percent compared to 28 percent for 
turkmenistan 22 percent for kirghizia 29 percent for uzbekistan 
and 34 percent for tadzhikistan 
feshbach his appetite whetted traces his finger along the 
lines of numbers and cyrillic characters to figure how many people 
died in the armenian earthquake last december 
pulling down soviet statistical handbooks from his office 
shelves feshbach calculates the population of armenia had been 
growing by about 50000 per year adds that to the 1988 figure 
subtracts the 1989 figure and concludes there are approximately 
250000 fewer people in armenia than there would have been with 
no earthquake 
the official soviet death toll 25000 without more data it is 
impossible to explain the discrepancy 
similar methodology has produced headlinegrabbing results over 
the years 
in 1980 feshbach reported that infant mortality in the soviet 
union had risen 36 percent since 1971 to at least 31 deaths per 
thousand births compared to 12 deaths per thousand births in the 
united states 
soviet officials were aware of the problem and had censored 
infant mortality statistics from their publications since 1975 but 
feshbach unearthed data the censors missed 
lashing out at that they called lurid accounts appearing in 
the west soviet officials called a news conference in moscow to 
claim the rise in infant mortality was due to better reporting the 
soviets now acknowledge that health care needs improving 
feshbach has mined other soviet secrets 
in the mid1960s he reported the soviets had a severe labor 
shortage not until 1976 did kremlin leaders admit that 
he has been predicting for years that the exploding population 
of central asia would pose problems particularly in the military 
recent soviet articles have confirmed that the central asia 
conscripts have trouble mastering the russian language and the 
complicated machinery of modern war 
among the puzzles feshbach is working from the latest census is 
the evacuation pattern after the nuclear accident at chernobyl in 
april 1986 
we already know they evacuated 116000 people they told us 
that he said although preliminary data is sketchy it shows a 
marked migration from surrounding administrative regions or 
oblasts

four south african antiapartheid leaders are 
seeking support from us leaders for their plan for negotiations 
with the white south african government to end its racial 
segregation policies 
the group led by nobel peace prize laureate archbishop desmond 
tutu were to present their plan today on capitol hill to some 80 
lawmakers governors business leaders and academics they have 
also asked to meet with president bush 
the blueprint includes constitutional principles for a 
postapartheid south africa said randall robinson director of 
transafrica the lobbying group coordinating the visit the south 
african delegation also includes the revs allan boesak beyers 
naude and frank chikane 
robinson said the four will propose a detailed negotiating 
process with their government they hope to salvage the window of 
opportunity that exists now for a negotiated settlement he said 
in an interview it wont exist forever and then therell only 
be bloodshed 
us antiapartheid leaders and government officials believe an 
expected leadership change in south africa means an opportunity to 
engage in negotiations with the government on granting political 
rights to the black majority 
national party leader fw de klerk who is expected to become 
south africas next leader once president pw botha retires in 
september has called for a new political system in his country 
although he rejects a oneperson onevote system espoused by 
antiapartheid groups 
there has been speculation de klerk may come to the united 
states for a visit later this year 
state department officials say the administration has decided to 
broaden its contacts with south african leaders across the 
political spectrum and that a de klerk visit is possible 
the proposals of the antiapartheid leadership prompted 
publication tuesday of a gallup survey showing most south africans 
oppose international economic sanctions because they believe the 
sanctions lead to joblessness rather than political change 
only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea because 
they would force the government to abolish apartheid six of 10 
blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led the 
government to resign within five years 
the survey of 2192 people 1400 blacks 392 whites and 400 of 
mixed race and asian origin was commissioned by the south african 
chamber of mines representing the countrys mining industry 
of those polled 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of the 
whites rejected foreign sanctions with most saying they would lead 
to higher unemployment 
congress imposed limited sanctions on south africa in 1986 
overriding a veto by thenpresident reagan in an effort to force 
the government to grant political rights to the black majority 
the survey conducted between march 11 and may 8 had a 4 
percent margin of error neil upmeyer research director for 
gallup said that to ensure credibility of the responses 
interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewers 
who were of the same race as the respondent 
in the survey 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of the 
whites and 58 percent of all respondents said american companies 
in south africa can help make the government moderate its racial 
policies 
of those polled 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whites 
said ending american business operations would seriously hurt the 
south african economy

schools the environment roads crime and welfare reform in their 
session tuesday 
bush responded by agreeing to call a national summit meeting on 
education baliles said 
governors are realistic they know these issues are not going 
to be resolved in 100 days democrat baliles said but theyre 
also eager for results we want to work with washington but were 
not waiting on washington 
iowas republican gov terry branstad said he urged more federal 
effort to help midwestern farmers deal with drought and sought a

the rules branstad said dont fit the spirit of the 
welfare reform act 
thirteen governors representing the national governors 
association met with the president for 30 minutes in the cabinet 
room 
the meeting made up for one that was canceled in february 
because bush was out of the country during the governors annual 
washington meeting he will host a formal state dinner for the 
governors monday night 
i think that he clearly understands that for his initiatives 
to suceed he needs support from those who are working at the state 
level said ohio gov richard celeste a democrat 
vermont gov madeleine kunin said she encouraged bush to support 
strengthening the clean air act and told him that delay is now 
not acceptable on the issue she said bush seems to agree with 
that fundamental message 
branstad said he had first suggested a summit meeting of 
governors and education leaders when bush met with them after his 
election in november he said bush voiced his intention to hold one 
in september including governors and state education chiefs 
a recent report by education secretary lauro cavazos which 
ranked the states education efforts concluded that overall 
education is not improving in the nation 
despite that branstad said there are exciting and innovative 
things happening in many of the states to deal with the education 
problems of the nation and this summit conference is going to give 
us an opportunity to share them 
the governors released a report by their task force on research 
and technology which said states and the federal government should 
promote commercial applications of technological advances that are 
necessary to make the united states more competitive with other 
countries 
it recommended a revision of federal antitrust laws to promote 
joint research and development projects by businesses and renewal 
of the federal tax credit for research and development

william lucas nominated by president bush to 
be the governments civil rights chief reported receiving more 
than half his salary income last year from earnings as a republican 
party consultant 
the nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights 
reported that 65000 of his 125500 in earnings came from the 
republican national committee 
lucas a black republican whose nomination has drawn opposition 
from several major civil rights groups reported on a financial 
disclosure form that he earned the money as a consultant chairing 
the gops minority outreach committee 
a former sheriff and chief executive of wayne county mich who 
ran unsuccessfully for michigan governor in 1986 lucas worked to 
recruit blacks into the gop last year 
a number of civil rights organizations including the naacp and 
the leadership conference on civil rights a coalition of 180 
groups question lucas professional qualifications to head the 
justice departments civil rights division 
several other civil rights leaders including jesse jackson 
support lucas nomination 
on the financial disclosure form released tuesday lucas 
reported earning 25000 in legal fees from two companies whose 
officers benefited from a 1984 contract he approved to renovate an 
historic public office building in downtown detroit when he was 
wayne countys chief executive 
lucas was cleared of allegations made then that he had steered 
the contract to the investment partnership because one of his top 
aides was part owner of the construction firm hired to perform the 
25 million renovation

finding out about that interest and went with another construction

a cruise company whose luxury liner rammed 
into a cuban merchant vessel killing its captain and two seamen 
is refusing to cooperate with federal investigators according to 
safety officials 
a spokesman for carnival cruise ship lines however said the 
miami company is responding to investigators in liberia where its 
vessel is registered and accused the head of the national 
transportation safety board of making misleading and totally 
irresponsible statements about the company 
james l kolstad acting board chairman said tuesday that 
carnival had refused to honor subpoenas for information and 
witnesses related to the feb 10 collision between carnivals 
733foot celebration which was carrying 2251 people and the 
351foot capitan san luis a cuban cement carrier 
the san luis which was carrying a 45member crew split apart 
and sank 
we are especially concerned said kolstad with any 
americanbased company using us ports and carrying thousands of 
us citizens each year refusing to cooperate for whatever 
reason with our nations chief accident investigation agency 
looking into situations that could result in a catastrophic loss of 
life 
kolstad said the companys refusal raises serious questions 
about whether this company wants to provide the highest available 
levels of safety protection for its passengers 
he said the board would continue to vigorously pursue its 
investigation into the accident 
a board investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the board is concerned that the foreign registry of ships will be 
used to hinder future investigations into accidents that could 
involve the loss of american lives aboard a ship operated by an 
american company 
the board has no judicial power and relies on the cooperation of 
parties involved in its investigations it determines the probable 
cause of accidents and makes recommendations for government and 
private action to improve safety 
carnival spokesman tim gallagher declined to say whether the 
company had refused to provide the safety board with any 
information saying we are fully cooperating with the 
appropriate authority in the investigation which is the bureau of 
maritime affairs republic of liberia 
none of the 1580 passengers or 671 crew members aboard the 
cruise ship was injured in the collision the ship lowered 
lifeboats to rescue 42 surviving cuban crewmembers but the san 
luis captain and two other crewmembers were lost at sea 
carnival cruise which was established in 1974 owns seven ships 
and carried about 579000 passengers mostly americans last year 
on cruises around the caribbean the bahamas and the mexican 
riviera 
the cruise ship which was returning from a sevenday caribbean 
cruise had an 18inch gash in its side and black scrape marks on 
its bow 
the san luis was en route from havana to tenerife in the canary 
islands for repairs and was reported adrift in the predawn water 
without lights when it was hit 
authorities said the san luis was struck in the rear deckhouse 
which separated and sank almost immediately the bow section 
remained afloat for several hours before it sank 
cuban authorities questioned the celebrations italian captain 
rafaele gravino who later said the cuban vessel was drifting in a 
major shipping channel 
cruise officials said the celebration had three operating radar 
systems and an officer who checked the radar 20 minutes before the 
crash saw nothing in the ships path 
gavino told a news conference at the time that radar is checked 
frequently when there is no visibility but when there is good 
visibility you are supposed to see the lights of the other ship 
cubas official news agency prensa latina quoted the san luis 
helmsman as saying the ship tried to warn the celebration to 
maneuver and avoid the accident

voters endorsed a plan to replace cramped 
stapleton international airport the nations fifth busiest with a 
new airport more than 20 miles from downtown 
with all of the citys 459 precincts reporting the referendum 
had passed by 70122 votes to 41754 votes a 63to37 percent 
margin 
this is a victory for the city and the people of denver 
said a jubilant denver mayor federico pena who had campaigned hard 
for the referendum 
it gives us direction said gov roy romer another strong 
backer of the measure it says we have a future and were going 
to claim it 
opponents of the new airport said they were not surprised by the 
vote dick young and bill chenoweth two of the most prominent 
opponents said they would not attempt to throw further roadblocks 
in the airports path 
the election was sold on the basis it the airport will 
create instant jobs a lot of people are hurting and they bought 
that young said 
the new airport which would cost an estimated 23 billion 
would be the first new us airport since dallasfort worth 
international opened in 1974 
the referendum was nonbinding although pena has said the city 
would abide by the results 
the referendum would authorize the city to secure federal grants 
and sell bonds then begin four years of construction later this 
year on 53 square miles of cityowned prairie 
airlines maintained low profiles during the referendum campaign 
but on tuesday night continental spokesman ned walker warned that 
funding for the airport was far from certain 
unfortunately the referendum may actually have set the new 
airport back because it excludes the use of city taxes as a 
component of the project financing plan it did nothing to solve 
the main problem and that is where will denver find the 23 
billion it now says the new airport will cost walker said

supporters argued that stapleton built in 1929 has a limited 
capacity to expand and has gotten a bad reputation for delays 
the new airport design calls for two concourses with 94 boarding 
gates which could be expanded to 120 stapleton has 94 gates its 
five runways would be built in a configuration differing from 
stapletons four parallel runways 
federal aviation administration regulations currently force the 
closure of stapletons runways when visibility is low causing 
nationwide flight delays 
supporters also said the project would bring a bonanza of 
construction jobs and spinoff development that would make denver a 
midcontinent hub for wholesale shipping and telecommunications 
companies 
opponents scoffed at that and also said the project was too 
risky given denvers sagging economy and turmoil in the airline 
industry 
what kind of business would locate in an area just because 
they have a huge airport i dont see the airport driving economic 
growth i think economic growth drives the airport size said 
former state attorney general jd macfarlane who campaigned 
against the new irport 
opponents also contended the proposal was driven not by need 
but by the political ambitions of the mayor and gov roy romer and 
by opportunistic land developers consultants and investment 
bankers

a group of affluent teenage 
skinheads suspected in attacks on up to two dozen homosexual 
men boasted to police after their arrest in a park authorities 
said 
were still shaking our heads at how freely they talked about 
their actions deputy police chief terrence rickard said tuesday 
its a sad commentary on our society 
the looseknit group calls itself the buffalo rochester aryan 
skinheads or brash and its 10 members live in affluent 
neighborhoods in the rochester area 
we didnt even know this group existed until we arrested them 
and they told us who they were rickard said the officers who 
made the arrests were amazed and disgusted at what they were 
saying 
he said he knew skinhead groups had caused trouble elsewhere 
but he was surprised to find one in this northwestern new york city 
police learned of the group when undercover officers stopped an 
attack friday night in highland park which rickard said is a 
popular meeting place for homosexuals the youths two age 16 and 
the others 18 and 19 were arrested and charged with beating a 
30yearold man 
the eight were jailed over the weekend seven were released on 
250 bail monday the other was released on his own recognizance 
each was charged with seconddegree robbery seconddegree 
assault and fourthdegree grand larceny which carry maximum 
penalties of five to 15 years in prison the 16yearolds are being 
charged as adults 
in his statement to police one of the groups leaders 
16yearold timothy waite of rochester said basically what we 
believe is that we do not like blacks or homosexuals 
rickard said it appears the attacks were only against 
homosexuals 
another suspect 16yearold andrew johnroe of nearby pittsford 
told police gay bashing is when we lure a gay guy into our path 
and jump him sometimes his wallet gets stolen but most of the 
time we just beat him up real bad 
the attacks outraged homosexualrights activists 
we will not tolerate violence against gay people said 
claire parker president of the gay alliance of the genesee valley 
if we have to patrol the parks to ensure our safety we will 
activist martin hiraga said attacks against homosexuals go 
unreported because the victims dont want their homosexuality 
revealed he said assailants have been known to meet homosexual men 
at bars and lure them into the park where they are beaten other 
times homosexual men have been attacked in parked cars or as they 
walk through the park 
rickard said none of the members of the group actually have 
shaved heads a trademark of the skinhead movement he said the 
group has nothing to do with buffalo which is 75 miles west of 
rochester 
the skinhead subculture emerged in working class neighborhoods 
in england as early as the 1960s

the artificial sweetener cyclamate may find 
its way back on the market after being banned for 20 years as a 
suspected carcinogen but probably not before next year the food 
and drug administration says 
the fda said tuesday it is continuing a review of the sweetener 
commenting in response to a washington post story that quoted an 
fda official as saying the agency made a mistake in banning 
cyclamate 
the agency has been considering lifting the cyclamate ban since 
1982 and though studies have challenged initial claims that the 
sweetener causes bladder cancer other safety concerns remain 
the final studies arent expected until summer and fall and 
then the fda would have to review that data and there would have to 
be some time for public comment so it may be hard to get all that 
completed this year and thats assuming the studies are 
favorable said fda spokesman bill grigg 
among the concerns are cyclamates effects on blood pressure and 
whether it causes genetic damage testicular atrophy or promotes 
tumor growth 
the post quoted robert scheuplein acting director of the office 
of toxicological services for the fdas center for food safety and 
applied nutrition as saying i have no reluctance in saying that 
with cyclamate we made a mistake 
calls seeking comment from scheuplein were referred to the fdas 
press office and spokesman emil corwin said no interviews would be 
granted 
grigg declined to comment directly on scheupleins remark but 
noted the fda said as far back as 1973 that if the larger base 
of data showed that the early data on which we based the decision 
to ban cyclamate were faulty that we would reverse it 
scheupleins comment was encouraging to the calorie control 
council an industry group representing soft drink and dietetic 
food manufacturers that has been seeking to reintroduce cyclamate 
we look forward to reapproval as soon as possible said 
council spokesman keith keeney 
the council and abbott laboratories of north chicago ill the 
major producer of cyclamate in 1982 filed the latest of many 
petitions to the fda for reconsideration of the ban 
cyclamate was first used in foods and beverages in the early 
1950s before enactment of a law later that decade requiring 
premarket review of food additives it was banned in 1969 and the 
fda reaffirmed that ban in 1976 and 1980 
the fdas cancer assessment committee concluded in 1985 that 
cyclamate does not by itself cause cancer in a report later that 
year the national academy of sciences said cyclamate does not 
cause cancer but may play a secondary role that should be examined 
more closely 
the center for science in the public interest took issue with 
the findings of the reports spokeswoman lisa lefferts said im 
not sure the jurys in on cancer and the center has further 
concerns about the possibility that cyclamate causes testicular 
atrophy inhibits growth and damages chromosomes 
we dont think fda is likely to reverse its decision on 
cyclamate if they do theyre going to have to make a lot of 
evidence disappear lefferts said 
the most common nonsugar sweeteners used in the united states 
are aspartame or nutrasweet and saccharin the fda proposed to 
ban saccharin in 1977 because it is suspected of causing cancer 
but congress has allowed it to continue on the market with a 
cancerrelated warning label 
the fda last year approved acesulfame potassium or sunette as 
a caloriefree sweetener for table use and for chewing gum dry 
beverage mixes instant coffee and tea gelatins puddings and 
nondairy creamers

the national institutes of health is settling 
a suit by adopting a requirement that opens deliberations and votes 
on human gene research to the public 
the suit filed jan 30 by a private foundation challenged the 
first planned introduction of a foreign gene into human beings an 
experiment which will be conducted on 10 patients who are 
terminally ill with melanoma a skin cancer 
the experiment may take place later this week jeremy rifkin 
president of the foundation on economic trends said tuesday after 
the court settlement was reached 
the foundation and rifkin filed the suit against health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan and nih director james 
wyngaarden 
rifkin said the settlement clears the way for the experiment 
however the experiment was not held up on account of the lawsuit 
asserted margot de ferranti a justice department lawyer who 
defended the government in the case she said nih has been in the 
process of finding terminally ill cancer patients to participate in 
the experiment 
us district judge john g penn signed the agreement dismissing 
the suit which alleged the nih recombinant dna advisory committee 
approved the experiment on melanoma patients without conducting 
proper public hearings 
under the agreement the committee must hold all future 
deliberations and votes in public sessions 
sullivan approved amendments to the dna committees charter 
containing the requirement 
a knowledgeable nih official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the committees deliberations and voting ordinarily 
are open to the public he said the panel had earlier approved the 
experiment in open session but then conducted a mailed ballot as a 
reconfirmation of that decision 
the changes in the charter spell out an orderly process of 
review nih spokeswoman anne thomas said in a statement some 
of the changes were suggested by dr wyngaarden with the 
concurrence of the committee we are pleased that this has been 
resolved she added 
this will be the first major medical technology in which the 
public will be allowed to fully participate in the review 
process said rifkin we hope it will set a precedent other 
countries look to the united states for the lead 
rifkin said the settlement allows active participation 
organizations like mine can propose amendments to proposed 
experiments in advance that then have to be put on the agenda 
that have to be voted on by that committee 
however the public has long had an opportunity to participate 
and make its views known to the committee including the right to 
propose amendments to the guidelines said the nih official 
rifkin and his group said a review of the original proposal by a 
subcommittee wasnt conducted with public notice and public 
participation and that final approval by the full committee was by 
a mailed ballot instead of in public under the agreement the 
subcommittee sessions may still be conducted privately 
the dna committee approved research in january to introduce into 
melanoma patients a type of immune cell called tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes that has been genetically altered 
in earlier work three nih researchers showed that til cells can 
be used to battle cancer by taking them from a patients tumor 
growing them in large numbers and reinserting them into a patient 
the technique was at least partially successful in 12 of 20 
patients 
the scientists now want to trace the white blood cells after 
they are returned to the patient to understand why til therapy 
works for some but not others to do this they want to mark the 
cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance to neomycin 
an antibiotic in this way cells from the patients tumors or 
blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells into the 
tumors could be monitored 
to get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood cells the 
scientists propose to use a mouse leukemia retrovirus

stringent recordkeeping requirements in a 
child antipornography statute are unconstitutional according to a 
federal judge who said the restrictions infringe on first amendment 
rights 
us district judge george revercomb on tuesday handed down the 
decision on the 1988 child protection and obscenity enforcement 
act which requires publishers and distributors to document the 
ages of nude models in photographs 
under the law models and performers must be contacted to 
determine if they were at least 18 years old at the time the 
photograph or film was made the requirements cover the reissue of 
images first made after feb 6 1978 the date of the chief federal 
law criminalizing child pornography said the judge 
the requirements have not been narrowly tailored to fit the 
legitimate governmental interest of stopping child pornography 
revercomb said in a 43page decision they burden too heavily and 
infringe too deeply on the right to produce material protected by 
the first amendment he wrote 
the result of the requirement will undoubtedly be the 
effective prohibition of the distribution of much first amendment 
protected material the opinion said 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the american library 
association 
revercomb also found unconstitutional companion requirements 
providing for a presumption of criminality by those who fail to 
abide by recordkeeping requirements 
proof that a person being prosecuted for a child porn offense 
failed to keep the proper records shall raise a rebuttable 
presumption that such performer was a minor according to the law 
revercomb said the criminal presumptions raise the serious 
potential for convicting people who have not engaged in child 
pornography 
the judge also found unconstitutional parts of a civil provision 
in the child pornography law and portions of a criminal forfeiture 
provision allowing seizure of materials before conviction 
the provisions allow forfeiture of property used to promote the 
commission of an offense revercomb blocked the government from 
enforcing the provisions unless there has been a prior adversarial 
proceeding 
the court also enjoined the government from enforcing the 
postconviction forfeiture provisions of the law unless there has 
been a pattern of activity 
the laws at issue here appear to authorize forfeiture of vast 
amounts of assets everything from first amendment protected 
material to bank accounts for a single violation said the 
judge 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said the department was 
still reviewing the opinion and studying its impact and had no 
further immediate comment 
bruce ennis an attorney representing the american library 
association said last month the law puts nearimpossible 
recordkeeping burdens on legitimate businesses it would impose a 
corporate death penalty on distributors because all assets 
could be seized if they violate the law with even one publication 
ennis said

rep john bryant is seeking to severely 
restrict the practice of clearcutting in national forests calling 
the timber harvesting method irresponsible and wasteful 
but the us forest service and industry representatives say 
clearcutting timber is a valuable forest management tool and is 
vital to maintaining habitat for certain species of wildlife 
clearcutting ignores the need for natural species diversity 
as a requirement for a healthy forest environment bryant 
dtexas said tuesday 
he was referring to the practice of cutting down all the trees 
in an area rather than selectively picking trees to fell 
a live healthy forest is replaced after a clearcut with a 
single species of tree plantation which forest experts believe 
loses its immunity to natural infestations of treekilling pests 
such as the southern pine beetle bryant said 
bryant introduced legislation to prohibit clearcutting in any 
national forest in which onetenth of the acreage of available 
commercial timberland has already been harvested by clearcutting 
many national forests would be affected he said 
the forest service would be required to replace clearcutting 
with selectionmanagement harvesting techniques in which only 
certain trees are removed from a stand and a diversity of plants 
remain 
although backed by some environmentalists bryant acknowledged a 
tough fight ahead and intense pressure from timber industry 
lobbyists to prevent a serious hearing on the bill 
last year 283061 acres of national forest were clearcut 
bryant said national forests cover 191 million acres of which 61 
million are classified as suitable for timber production 
dave hessel director of timber management at the forest 
service said clearcutting is valuable in maintaining not only 
species diversity but also in its relationship to maintaining 
wildlife habitat needs 
hessel said clearcutting is needed for stands of trees that 
require sunlight to develop like the lodgepole pine lodgepole 
pine forests provide the habitat for big game species like elk in 
the rocky mountains 
the roughly 300000 acres that are clearcut represent about half 
the acreage harvested in national forests but produce 75 percent 
of the volume hessel said 
mark rey vice president for public forestry at national forest 
products association said clearcutting is not inconsistent with 
high wildlife values species diversity and multiple uses for 
forests 
rey also contends the bill would indisputably reduce the 
amount of timber production potential the lands can have because 
some species must have sunlight to regenerate

women hold the key to economic development and 
slower population growth but many are trapped by cultural values 
and fundamentalist religions that put men first the head of the 
un population fund says 
dr nafis sadik of pakistan issued the agencys 1989 state of 
world population report on tuesday and called for a fivefold 
increase in world spending on family planning she said governments 
should put population control on a par with major economic 
investments 
with the worlds population at 52 billion and current growth at 
90 million people a year the united nations forecasts a stable 
population of 10 billion about a hundred years from now 
but this will not happen unless more of the worlds women are 
given more health care family planning services education and 
employment opportunities mrs sadik told a news conference 
without such measures she said the worlds population could 
nearly triple to 14 billion by the year 2100 crippling development 
and creating enormous potential for violence and social 
upheaval 
nations with fastgrowing populations are spending more on 
essentials and have little left for social programs mrs sadik 
said in the past four years 37 of the worlds poorest countries 
have cut health spending by 50 percent and education spending by 25 
percent she said 
about half the worlds women live in rural areas and in 
societies dominated by men and still dont have access to family 
planning she said 
south korea singapore and thailand are economic successes 
partly because strong family planning programs helped reduce high 
rates of population growth mrs sadik said 
we know from the world fertility survey that women would have 
fewer children if they had access to family planning she said 
in latin america 75 percent of women not using family 
planning say they want to postpone delay or limit their 
childbearing in asia the figure is 43 percent and in africa 27 
percent 
to stabilize the worlds population at 10 billion population 
growth must decline by onethird in the next 40 years the report 
says 
mrs sadik said the un population fund set a goal of extending 
family planning services to an additional 500 million women by the 
year 2000 and raise the number of contraceptive users from 465 
million today to 730 million 
the fund which has projects in 130 countries urged governments 
to earmark at least 1 percent of gross national product for family 
planning 
mrs sadik also called for a great expansion in womens 
education and literacy an end to legal and social discrimination 
against women and greater access to leadership positions for women 
she said that even many educated men do not see a need for 
equality and opportunity and that religious fundamentalism seems 
to be designed to somehow keep women in bondage 
mrs sadik mentioned pope john paul ii and moslem 
fundamentalists but said all religious movements look at the 
woman as the one who should cater to and serve the family never 
the other gender

the united states should maintain a strong 
military presence in east asia but avoid trying to make over 
other peoples in her own image says a singapore cabinet minister 
who is the son of prime minister lee kwan yew 
the united states tends to consider itself a moral example to 
the rest of the world and has a morallegal approach to foreign 
policy lee hsien loong told the asia society tuesday night 
but it is questionable whether us political values and 
institutions are universal commandments which apply to all 
mankind he added american efforts to make over other peoples 
in her own image have not been successful in asia 
lee 37 a reserve brigadier general minister of trade and 
industry and deputy defense minister was introduced as 
representative of the new generation of political leaders in the 
prosperous southeast asian citystate 
he defended singapore policies that have drawn criticism from 
the us government and from human rights organizations the use 
of preventive arrest against suspected subversives and restrictions 
on the foreign press 
it is questionable whether the us bill of rights is the 
right model for the fragile society of singapore he said 
restating arguments his father the prime minister has used to 
defend arrests and press controls as means of averting violence 
among the countrys diverse ethnic groups 
answering audience questions many about human rights he said 
reports that singapore police torture government critics are 
exaggerated 
despite differences between the two countries to singapore 
the us is a benevolent power lee said 
lee said america should maintain a military presence in the 
region for as long as possible because it will keep the 
influence of the soviet union in check make it unnecessary for 
japan to rearm and balance peoples republic of china forces 
however the united states should keep hands off the internal 
affairs of the countries of the region he continued because 
despite its towering achievements the american civilization is 
not a universally valid model 
the export of american values and culture has not always 
worked not even in countries such as the philippines and south 
korea he said 
in the philippines usstyle constitutional government based 
on checks and balances between branches of government was already 
malfunctioning before the era of deposed president ferdinand 
marcos lee said 
an american style freewheeling press purveying junk in the 
marketplace of ideas led to confusion and bewilderment not to 
enlightenment and truth in the philippines lee said 
after marcos was ousted in 1985 he continued the filipino 
press has reverted to their old irresponsible and irrepressible 
ways today many thoughtful filipinos wonder whether their 
association with the us was a stunting or a liberating 
experience

gasoline prices are likely to rise four cents 
more a gallon by summer and the supply outlook is unclear a 
government agency says 
the energy information administration said tuesday that prices 
for all grades are likely to average 109 a gallon up from 105 
now the average price last summer was 99 cents a gallon the 
report said 
prices rose sharply immediately after the march 24 exxon oil 
tanker spill in alaska which caused a brief drop in shipments of 
north slope crude oil but then stabilized 
the additional price increases by summer will reflect a recent 
rise in crude oil prices paid by refiners and an estimated 1 cent 
per gallon increase in state gasoline taxes the report said 
also putting upward pressure on prices should be the usual 
summertime jump in gasoline demand reaching a level 19 percent 
higher than last summer the agency said 
the report said that while gasoline supplies currently are 
adequate a squeeze could develop this summer if increased import 
requirements cannot be met it said onehalf of the anticipated 
increase in gasoline demand would have to be met by imports

denver residents voted to boost their citys growth with a new 
2 billion airport while seattle residents voted to limit growth

a runaway freight train that 
jumped a track and killed four people may have been too heavily 
loaded for its locomotives braking capacity investigators say 
national transportation safety board investigators focused on 
the role the 69car trains weight may have played in the accident 
that damaged or destroyed 11 houses 
they said a southern pacific worker believes the train weighed 
nearly 3000 tons more than the weight recorded for the crew on 
documents 
the train ran off the tracks early friday at 90 mph at the 
bottom of a mountain grade on a curve trains are supposed to take 
at 30 mph two boys in one of the homes and two crewmen on the 
train were killed 
shipping documents indicated the train weighed 6150 tons a 
measurement determined by three railroad clerks jim kolstad the 
safety boards acting chairman told reporters late tuesday 
southern pacifics assistant chief dispatcher albert hale 
estimated the train weighed at least 8950 tons according to 
investigators investigators said only three of the trains six 
locomotives had adequate braking power 
the three locomotives would have controlled a 6150ton train 
according to a computer simulation run by the ntsb but the 
simulation also showed six locomotives were needed to control a 
train of the weight estimated by hale 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said the investigation so far 
has not determined conclusively what caused the accident it will 
be six to nine months before the final ntsb report is completed 
meanwhile the line reopened tuesday afternoon with two trains 
rolling down cajon pass and through the area said railroad 
spokesman jerry pera 
city attorney james penman who had city council authorization 
to seek an injunction to keep the track closed had insisted that 
southern pacific purchase the properties damaged in the accident 
southern pacific and the city reached agreement hours before 
tuesdays threatened court action designed to shut down the track 
penman said the agreement opening the track avoided what could 
have been a long court fight we know it is difficult to get an 
injunction against a national transportation arm he said 
southern pacific had agreed to buy seven destroyed house for 
70000 each on tuesday afternoon they agreed to buy four other 
houses and accepted the citys demand for an undeveloped land 
buffer in case of another derailment 
the area will become a greenbelt area said mayor evelyn 
wilcox the rail line is there and weve done our best to ensure 
the health and safety of the residents 
the company also agreed to pay the costs of relocating residents 
and housing them for 90 days pick up the citys cleanup costs and 
defend san bernardino in any lawsuit resulting from the wreck 
homeowner fred revely whose property was bought by the 
railroad said he was pleased with the agreement im very happy 
with everything that southern pacific has done he said

boston university seniors are getting a final 
lesson in supply and demand tickets to this weekends commencement 
featuring president bush and french president francois mitterrand 
are being scalped for as much as 100 
about 30000 people 10000 more than usual are expected at 
the ceremony for which each of the 5600 seniors was allotted four 
tickets 
we havent had to use a system like this in the past because 
weve been able to accommodate everyone but the students response 
this year has been overwhelming bu executive vice president jon 
westling said tuesday 
most students say their parents wouldnt dream of missing 
graduation or the chance to watch two world leaders collect 
honorary degrees and for those with small families or eager to 
make a buck the opportunity to wheel and deal is attractive 
its a very difficult thing to stop but its not something we 
encourage or condone westling said of the scalping 
university president john silber helped persuade bush and 
mitterrand to come to the schools urban campus 
silber knows bush from his days at the university of texas in 
the 1960s university spokesman thomas cashman said he also has 
become acquainted with mitterrand recently through nobel laureate 
elie wiesel a bu professor and friend of the french president 
cashman said 
the coup has allowed bu to dominate the keen annual competition 
among massachusetts 120 colleges for commencement speakers 
harvard university and tufts university had to settle for just one 
world leader each pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto and un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar respectively 
nevertheless senior cindy carron said she regarded the 
presidents visits a mixed blessing because it limits the number of 
tickets available and requires extensive security checks 
id almost rather have my whole family there to share in the 
ceremony instead of the president whos untouchable she said

a councilman urged the city to construct 
a ufo landing pad to welcome extraterrestials his colleagues 
quickly brought him down to earth 
george darden has a reputation for filing unusual bills 
including one last year that would have outlawed sex in metro 
courthouse 
on tuesday night darden asked his colleagues to show a little 
earthly hospitality to visitors from outer space 
many people have come to me expressing the fact that they are 
seeing these unidentified flying objects he told the councils 
rules committee 
the committee unanimously defeated the resolution the council 
later defeated it 271 with darden the only supporter 
you might live to regret this day he told the council 
chiding members for not taking his proposal seriously 
councilman tom sharp suggested amending the bill to allow the 
landing pad be constructed only in dardens district 
councilman charles french proposed giving ufos access to the 
airport 
and mayor bill boner said earlier that if the resolution passed 
he would see if aliens would support a contract on a leaseback 
basis although the currency exchange would be a dilemma 
darden told reporters later he would build the landing pad 
himself

a cuban familys exile has ended with 
shouts of joy as they returned to this country five months after 
crossing into canada for what was supposed to be a brief look at 
niagara falls 
feliz feliz bermaida fajardo yelled in spanish as she ran 
from a car to hug a friend 
even though the family lived in miami for several years and 
owned a home and business there us officials blocked their 
return from a christmastime sightseeing trip to ontario because 
they lacked proof of citizenship 
i made a mistake mrs fajardos husband carlos said 
tuesday after crossing the peace bridge into buffalo we should 
not have left the country i know that now 
at the time fajardo had an application for political asylum 
pending but it was nullified when the fajardos and their two 
children crossed the border 
fajardo his wife and her two children yoradlys and yoandys 
had traveled north during the christmas holidays to see snow they 
said they crossed into canada to get a better view of niagara falls 
much of the familys stay in canada was spent trying to get a 
new application prepared 
their plight attracted the attention of miamis hispanic 
community and sen bob graham dfla appealed to immigration 
officials to allow them to return on humanitarian grounds 
but benedict ferro district director of the us immigration 
and naturalization service in buffalo denied the request for 
humanitarian parole in march citing the familys record of 
immigration fraud 
ferro said mrs fajardo used phony documents to enter the 
country illegally in 1985 and that an immigration judge ruled last 
summer that she and her two children by another marriage should be 
deported 
but after a new application for asylum and subsequent ins 
investigation ferro said he could overlook the history of fraud 
because fajardo had a legitimate fear of political persecution if 
returned to cuba 
the system worked the way it is supposed to ferro said 
they were denied parole on merit but they were able to meet 
the test for asylum those are two different standards 
sister kathleen rimar who acted as the fajardos attorney 
criticized immigration officials 
they could have been allowed to return much sooner but i think 
they felt they had to make an example of them she said 
she said that during the exile in canada the fajardos lost their 
home and business in miami 
despite the losses fajardo said he felt no animosity toward 
immigration officials 
i dont think about that im only interested in the future 
fajardo said i feel like i have been born again 
the family plans to spend a few days in buffalo and then return 
to the miami area where friends and relatives will help them 
reestablish a boat building business 
immigration officials said the family would be able to apply for 
citizenship next year

christians and moslems staged a 
nationwide oneday strike today in a unique show of unity to mourn 
the spiritual leader of the countrys sunni moslems who was 
assassinated in a car bombing 
lebanon today mourns its knight the martyr of national unity 
sheik hassan khaled said the voice of lebanon radio mouthpiece 
of the rightwing christian phalange party 
the grand mufti as he was known was killed along with 21 other 
people in tuesday when the bomb exploded in a densely populated 
residential district of syrianpoliced west beirut as his car drove 
past 
seventyfive people were wounded and two buildings devastated 
banks government offices shops restaurants movie theaters 
and other businesses closed today in all areas including israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in the south police said no 
trouble was reported 
this is the first total shutdown in lebanon since the civil 
war broke out in 1975 said a police spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing regulations 
khaled 68 was the most senior sunni cleric in lebanon a post 
he held for 23 years his assassination silenced the moslems most 
prominent advocate of moderation he had guided his 900000 
followers into seeking peaceful coexistence with lebanons 
christians to end the 14yearold civil war 
as is usual with car bombings there has been no claim of 
responsibility for tuesdays carnage 
syria and its leftist militia allies in separate statements 
blamed khaleds assassination on army commander gen michel aoun 
whose mainly christian troops have been locked in fierce artillery 
and rocket battles with the syrian forces and their moslem and 
druse allies since march 8 
aoun who also heads a christian government vying for power with 
a rival moslem cabinet pointed the finger at the syrians who he 
has branded an occupying force in lebanon although he did not name 
them 
he described khaled as a great bold leader and expressed 
the hope that his slaying would guide the lebanese to take a 
unified stand against the occupiers of our land 
aoun and the lebanese front alliance of rightwing christian 
political groups ordered a total shutdown today throughout the 
310squaremile christian enclave to mourn the grand mufti 
christian moslem and leftist radio stations broadcast somber 
music to mourn khaled who is survived by a wife six sons and 
three daughters 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni who heads the 
predominantly moslem cabinet has pledged to follow khaleds 
moderate path 
we shall never deviate from the course of moderation our 
martyred grand mufti has charted hoss said in a statement 
tuesday 
lebanon has more shiite moslems than sunnis shiites loyal to 
iran are believed to hold most of the 15 foreigners missing in 
lebanon who include nine americans but sunnis are not believed to 
be involved in hostagetaking 
seventyfive moslems wounded in recent fighting left west beirut 
today in a convoy of ambulances for damascus syrias capital to 
board a plane for kuwait they are to be treated in hospitals there 
under a humanitarian program launched by the oilrich gulf state to 
aid moslem and christian victims of lebanons violence 
kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah alahmad alsabah heads 
a sixmember arab league committee seeking to mediate an end to the 
bloodshed 
a christian source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
preparations were under way to guarantee safe exit for an 
unspecified number of wounded christians to leave for kuwait 
police said syrian and druse gunners fired two dozen rockets and 
howitzer shells at the christian coastline early today violating a 
weekold ceasefire brokered by the arab league 
syria and its allies have declared they will keep shelling the 
christian coastline despite the truce to prevent aoun receiving 
supplies by sea 
aouns gunners did not respond to the violations which have 
blocked the deployment of a 321man force of military observers 
from kuwait and five other arab nations to monitor the ceasefire

workers at elsinores atlantis casino 
hotel expressed frustration and fear over news that the debtridden 
gaming hall has become the first to be ordered closed by new jersey 
regulators 
philip t forsyth a floor supervisor said he has found only 
parttime work as a dealer or cashier 
they hire parttime to save on benefits he said i have a 
1140 mortgage how can i work parttime 
other employees have been luckier than forsyth myrtile mays a 
dealer has a job lined up with another casino 
i went out looking for another job a couple of weeks ago 
just in case mays said 
mays said the mood among atlantis employees on tuesday was 
hyper really stressful a lot of people dont know how theyre 
going to pay their bills especially their mortgages 
forsyth said many employees are embittered toward company 
president jeanne hood blaming her for mismanagement 
she was brazen enough to walk through the casino a few days 
ago he said she was smiling and waving even though people 
were calling her names 
forsyth also said many employees are angered with developer 
donald trumps 63 million purchase agreement to buy the 
threetiered atlantis and convert it into a hotel without a casino 
the state casino control commission on tuesday ordered the 
casino to close next monday citing its estimated 144 million 
debt the hotel which runs at about 80 percent occupancy on 
weekends was allowed to remain open 
atlantic city which approved gambling in 1976 has 11 other 
casinos 
the atlantis has suffered heavy losses after opening in 1981 as 
the playboy hotel and casino it emerged last fall from federal 
bankruptcy reorganization 
some employees cried when they heard news of the closing 
were all very down the atlantis people were a very together 
people just trying to keep the place together said michael 
bucci a casino host 
some maintained optimism 
a lot of these people have gone through the rough years when 
the casino was still playboy the bankruptcy and two strikes 
said roy silbert president of local 54 of the hotel employees and 
restaurant employees international union 
theyre cautiously optimistic you never can predict whether 
or not this news will force something to happen to the business 
in recent weeks atlantis 2100 employees have anxiously 
watched as the state denied elsinore officials a license and 
appointed a conservator to control the gaming hall 
even if the 1100 casino floor employees find work at other 
gaming halls many will lose up to eight years of seniority and 
accompanying benefits others particularly those in supervisory 
positions will be unable to find similar positions 
silbert said tuesday that he planned to appeal the commissions 
decision in us district court in camden 
im not trying to stop the closing he said we just want 
to protect the federal mandate for adequate notice 
silbert said a recently enacted federal plant closing act 
requires an employer to notify workers 60 days in advance of any 
closing 
some atlantis customers reacted to the news with a shrug 
well just go to another casino said one customer sam 
giterman of philadelphia

central banks dollarselling intervention and ranged between 
13697 yen and 13775 yen 
the dollar has gained 326 yen in five straight trading days 
the dollaryen rate moved little in early trading as traders 
waited for the announcement later today of us trade figures for 
march but then traders began buying dollars following developments 
in japans influencepeddling scandal traders said 
tokyo prosecutors summoned takao fujinami a top aide to former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and katsuya ikeda a lawmaker 
from the clean government party for questioning in connection with 
alleged attempts by recruit co to buy influence 
for the third consecutive day the bank of japan intervened in 
an attempt to support the yen said masafumi koyama of the bank of 
tokyo 
the central bank reportedly sold 100 million to 200 million 
the bank does not comment on its activities in the exchange market 
other traders said the central bank intervention which failed 
to push the dollar lower was only to discourage the current 
dollarbuying mood 
kyodo news service quoted unidentified bank of japan officials 
as saying the dollars recent strength comes despite a lack of any 
changes in economic fundamentals and that the dollarbuying was 
overdone and speculative 
japan will continue to take determined measures in 
cooperation with other major monetary nations kyodo quoted the 
officials as saying

participants to some extent 
japanese investors were also concerned about the possible 
interest rate hike by the west german federal bank meeting 
tomorrow said ishizuka 
market players bought only cheaper issues because they were 
reluctant to make major moves still it shows that investors have 
so much money since prices rose even when they didnt have 
specific incentives to buy he said

million shares up from tuesdays 600 million among gainers were

at least 4000 chinese servicemen died in the 
vietnam war after china sent about 320000 of its forces to fight 
the united states according to a news report 
the report from the semiofficial hong kong china news agency 
attributed its information to the history of the peoples republic 
of china a new reference book published by chinas official state 
archives publishing house 
the report seen in hong kong today was believed to be the 
first chinese disclosure of a more precise figure on casualties 
which the chinese have said in the past was in the thousands 
the united states claimed repeatedly during the vietnam war that 
there was evidence chinese forces were involved in the war china 
denied the allegations 
china has acknowledged that its assistance to vietnam during the 
war which ended in a communist victory in 1975 included sending 
about 320000 personnel and 20 billion in aid 
but in 1979 when relations between china and vietnam 
deteriorated chinas official peoples daily newspaper and xinhua 
news agency published a booklet on chinas assistance to vietnam 
from january 1965 to march 1968 china dispatched to vietnam 
support forces of over 320000 men to undertake air defense 
engineering railway and logistics work the booklet said 
together with the vietnamese people the chinese support 
forces defended the territorial air space of north vietnam with 
their lives 
it added the remains of thousands of chinese martyrs lie on 
vietnamese soil to this day 
china and the soviet union were vietnams principal supporters 
during the war but relations between china and vietnam later 
deteriorated over vietnams persecution of ethnic chinese 
territorial conflicts vietnams close alliance with the soviet 
union and vietnams invasion of cambodia in 1978

prosecutors today questioned elected officials for 
the first time who are suspects in the influencepeddling scandal 
that has caused a rash of resignations and damaged public 
confidence in japanese politics 
the list of disgraced party leaders also grew as the chairman of 
the opposition komeito or clean government party said he would 
resign 
junya yano is the third party head to announce his resignation 
because of the scandal following prime minister norobu takeshita 
as president of the governing liberal democrats and saburo 
tsukamoto of the democratic socialists 
takeshita remains in office while the liberal democrats search 
for a leader and a prime minister who is respected and untainted by 
the scandal which has decimated the top ranks of politicians in 
japan 
takako doi head of the opposition japan socialist party said 
the disruption in komeito was disappointing at a time she is trying 
to hold together an opposition coalition to oust the liberal 
democrats 
i hope komeito will go ahead and unite with the socialists 
overcoming the latest trials ms doi said 
prosecutors meanwhile summoned two parliament members for 
questioning they said the lawmakers were suspected of accepting 
bribes in return for helping the recruit co in its business of 
employment information 
prosecutors say the conglomerate sought favors by selling 
cutprice stock in a subsidiary to about 160 politicians 
bureaucrats and business and media executives 
the buyers earned handsome profits after the shares went on sale 
to the public in 1986 and the price shot up 
prosecutors have charged 14 people with violations of bribery 
and securities laws but until today all the official suspects in 
the scandal were businessmen or civil servants 
liberal democrat takao fujinami 56 who served as chief cabinet 
secretary for three years under former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone was ordered to one prosecutors office and komeito 
legislator katsuya ikeda 51 was called to another 
by japanese legal custom the summoning was equivalent to 
arrest but since parliament is in session the prosecutors could 
not jail the two lawmakers without permission of the parliament 
fujinami plans to resign his seat in the house of 
representatives kyodo news service reported he is suspected of 
helping recruit in employment advertising and giving other favors 
in exchange for a profit of about 190000 in a share transaction 
handled by his secretary 
ikeda announced tuesday that he would resign his parliament seat 
to atone for causing troubles to his buddhistaffiliated party 
which is almost as deeply troubled by the recruit scandal as the 
liberal democrats 
ikeda had no power as an opposition legislator but prosecutors 
say he repeatedly brought issues before parliament to benefit 
recruit 
ikedas brother yuzuru earned about 73500 on recruit share 
transactions and reports say 70 percent of the profit went into 
ikedas own bank account 
fujinami and ikeda also received large donations from recruit 
komeito leaders met after the lawmakers were summoned and 
chairman yano later told reporters that he believed ikedas 
statement that he was innocent of wrongdoing 
but the komeito chairman said public trust in the party had been 
impaired 
i apologize from my heart and taking this situation seriously 
and realizing my own resposibility i resign the chairmanship 
yano said

colorado pena said tuesday night after the airport referendum 
passed denver just took off 
pena and colorado gov roy romer had campaigned hard to build a 
replacement for 60yearold stapleton international airport which 
detractors say is too old and small to serve a growing regional hub

abide by its results two leading opponents of the new airport 
announced after the election that they would honor the vote and not 
try to stop construction 
the referendum passed 627 percent to 373 percent with 70122

airport built in the united states since dallasfort worth 
international opened in 1974 
but first denver will have to come up with the money 
the city estimates that it needs 500 million in federal funds 
and 15 billion in revenue bonds pena said he would go to 
washington dc to deliver the citys letter of intent for 
federal funds to the federal aviation administration 
this is a national economic development decision that will be 
helpful to the entire country pena said we have to have a 
national transportation system that works that is the main 
argument i am making to congress 
transportation secretary samuel skinner had predicted that 
denver voters would approve the new airport calling the plan the 
most creative aviation development project in many years 
airlines maintained a low profile during the airport campaign 
but continental airlines spokesman ned walker said tuesday night 
that airport supporters had sidestepped the financing issue 
unfortunately the referendum may actually have set the new 
airport back because it excludes the use of city taxes as a 
component of the project financing plan walker said it did 
nothing to solve the main problem and that is where will denver 
find the 23 billion it now says the new airport will cost 
denver international airport scheduled for operation in 1994 
would be built about 17 miles northeast of downtown denver on 53 
square miles of land annexed last year from adams county 
plans for the new airport call for 94 boarding gates on two 
concourses with expansion later to 120 gates stapleton has 94 
a final environmental impact statement of the proposed airport 
site is expected in july or august and then construction can 
begin pena said he expected groundbreaking to take place later 
this year 
the lets vote yes campaign had argued that stapleton needed to 
be replaced to head off lengthy flight delays in the future they 
also said a new airport would stimulate the citys economy 
opponents including the lets vote no and save our airport 
campaigns said a decrease in air traffic at stapleton during the 
last two years was an indication that a new airport was unneeded 
they also said the new airport would be too costly and wouldnt 
improve the economy

wished the law allowed him to make the terms consecutive

recommendation

a village that went a century 
without a homicide is reeling from the fourth slaying of a woman in 
less than two years all apparently the result of domestic 
disputes police said 
police acting on a tip found the body of tracy sheperd 27 
early tuesday in the woods district attorney judd carhart said 
he said she was killed about a week ago apparently after a 
fight with her boyfriend 
carhart declined to say how the woman was killed pending an 
autopsy 
david macdonald a 30yearold bartender was arrested in the 
couples apartment police chief michael saharceski said he 
pleaded innocent to a murder charge and was ordered to undergo 
psychiatric tests 
the chief said the only links among the four killings were that 
the couples were all young and unmarried before the recent quartet 
of slayings the last prior homicide in the village of 5700 was in 
the 1880s when two paper mill workers fought in a bar saharceski 
said 
they are just cases of domestic violence and who knows why 
they happen he said we could have a police officer on every 
corner in town and we still couldnt stop what happened 
last week before the fourth slaying was discovered several 
hundred people marched in greenfield to protest domestic violence 
the march was one of several community events held to increase 
public awareness about violence 
it is deeply ironic if thats even the right word to find 
out after a whole week of education on violence that here we have 
another murder to deal with said debra mclaughlin a rally 
organizer its hard not to feel overwhelmed 
its insanity said mary osborn who lives just across the 
connecticut river in greenfield 
ms osborn a parttime student and volunteer at a womens 
shelter in northampton blamed the violence in part on hard times 
in the town of 6000 people 
its working class depressed the factories are all gone the 
people have been stripped of dignity in a lot of ways she said 
the first woman to die was vivian morrisey 31 strangled in 
september 1987 in her home her former boyfriend was convicted of 
murder and sentenced to life in prison 
nearly a year later virginia ferrer 27 onetime resident of a 
shelter for battered women was stabbed to death behind her home 
police arrested a man identified as the father of four of her 
children he is awaiting trial 
catherine gochinski 16 was found shot to death feb 3 in the 
apartment she shared with her 18yearold boyfriend and his sister

evacuation is mandatory this is not mandatory it is not an 
emergency it is voluntary

dependents being urged to move there are about 14000 military 
dependents in panama

playwright vaclav havel 
czechoslovakias most wellknown opposition activist was freed on 
probation today after serving half of an eightmonth jail sentence 
on protestrelated charges 
havel was arrested in january during a week of antigovernment 
protests 
his imprisonment widely condemned in the west as well as by 
intellectuals in poland hungary and the soviet union marked the 
start of a new crackdown on dissent by czechoslovak authorities 
czechoslovakias communist leaders have resisted the political 
reforms that are sweeping through much of the rest of the soviet 
bloc 
judge eva kvetenska ruled after a 12minute hearing that havel 
could be freed on good behavior but would be on probation for 18 
months if he violates the law in that time he would be jailed 
again for four months 
czechoslovak supporters admitted to the small courtroom 
adjoining the pankrac prison where havel was held applauded as he 
embraced his wife olga after the ruling 
i certainly think all the actions of solidarity helped a 
lot havel said after he was released about an hour later i am 
glad i was released but the whole sentence was nonsense i should 
not have been in jail at all 
havel a cofounder of the charter 77 human rights movement may 
have been released early to head off criticism at an international 
human rights conference opening in paris on may 30 opposition 
activists said 
czechoslovakia is one of the 35 nations that signed the 1975 
helsinki final act that will attend the meeting 
i am optimistic for one reason that they would prefer to look 
nice in paris rather than ugly said havels brother ivan but 
all that is guesswork we know that our authorities are not at all 
concerned with their public image 
at least 20 opposition activists have been jailed fined or 
given suspended sentences since the january protests 
havel 52 was sentenced on feb 22 to nine months in jail on 
charges of incitement and obstructing a police officer at a 
demonstration in prague on jan 16 
an appeals court threw out the obstruction charge in february 
and reduced the sentence to eight months havel then was moved to 
another jail where conditions were better and he was entitled to 
ask for parole midway through his sentence 
havel was charged with incitement after he used western radio 
stations to appeal to the anonymous authors of a letter who wrote 
him threatening to commit suicide to protest the lack of democracy 
in czechoslovakia 
he urged the writers not to emulate jan palach a czech student 
who died after setting himself ablaze in january 1969 to protest 
the previous summers sovietled invasion that crushed prague 
spring reforms 
about 3300 people had signed a petition supporting havels 
request for parole ivan havel said 
when the playwright was sentenced to 4 years in jail on charges 
of sedition in 1979 no one in czechoslovakia spoke up on behalf of 
havel and fellow charter 77 activists jailed with him 
after havels trial in february premier mieczyslaw rakowski of 
poland attended the warsaw premiere of two havel plays which are 
banned in czechoslovakia

an initiative to slow downtown growth passed 
easily surprising both supporters and opponents and leaving 
backers of the measure ecstatic 
we have won on the first try which i think is remarkable 
said ted inkley chairman of the campaign for the citizens 
alternative plan we had a sense when we began this campaign that 
there was a great deal of anger about how government had handled 
growth issues in the past 10 years 
initiative 31 known as cap for citizens alternative plan won 
62 percent approval at the polls tuesday with 98 percent of 
precincts reporting the vote was 42007 to 25958 a simple 
majority was required for passage 
the plan would limit the height and density of downtown 
buildings for the next 10 years while a longrange growth 
management plan is adopted it is exempt from city council 
amendments for two years 
this city of 500000 situated across puget sound from the 
olympic mountains already has more than 10 buildings higher than 
450 feet the 76story columbia center is the west coasts tallest 
building 
inkley and most opponents including the bulk of the citys 
business and labor establishment had predicted a close vote 
but peter steinbrueck another backer of the plan had predicted 
approval by as much as 21 
i had a feeling in my bones about it steinbrueck said i 
think that the city just didnt buy the incredible claims that were 
made by opponents and i think that the growth problems were 
selfevident 
the plan limits the height of new buildings to 450 feet about 
38 stories protects lowincome housing reduces density of new 
projects and requires a longterm downtown growth management 
program 
total downtown construction would be limited to 500000 square 
feet of office space a year from 1990 through 1994 and to 1 million 
square feet a year from 1995 through 1999 
the likely impact of the measure remained in doubt 
moreover buildings now under construction projects vested 
under permits issued before the initiative was filed and 
development permitted under the initiative are likely to maintain a 
surplus of downtown office space well into the 1990s

a jury rejected an insanity defense and 
convicted a man who killed his two young sons by putting them in a 
redhot foundry ladle 
bartley j dobben was found guilty of firstdegree murder but 
mentally ill in the thanksgiving day 1987 deaths of his sons by a 
muskegon county circuit court jury on tuesday 
firstdegree murder carries a mandatory sentence of life without 
parole a guilty but mentally ill verdict allows psychological 
treatment for convicts 
were shocked defense attorney pat nolan said adding he 
would appeal the verdict we expected a verdict of not guilty by 
reason of insanity i dont think there was any evidence to support 
the verdict 
dobben 28 of muskegon was accused of killing his sons 
bartley 2 and peter 15 months he was charged with putting the 
boys in a 1300degree foundry ladle at the plant where he worked 
while his pregnant wife waited outside 
circuit judge james graves jr scheduled sentencing for june 16 
were satisfied with the verdict county prosecutor tony 
tague said our main concern was that he be confined and not 
released into society because he is a danger 
the defense contended dobben diagnosed a paranoid 
schizophrenic was legally insane at the time of the slayings 
brett gardner an assistant muskegon county prosecutor contended 
dobben killed his sons because his marriage of four years was 
failing 
family and friends portrayed dobben as a loving attentive 
father who was obsessed with religion and believed the end of the 
world was near 
bizarre behavior suspicions that his wife was unfaithful and an 
obsessive belief that his family was in danger resulted in a 
60day courtordered stay at a psychiatric hospital in late 1985 
after a relatively calm year during which dobben took powerful 
psychotropic drugs that controlled his behavior he was persuaded 
by a selfordained minister to stop taking his medication and leave 
his wife witnesses said 
susan dobben testified she forgave her husband a day after the 
slayings and wanted him back home with her the couples third son 
will be 1 year old in june 
he would have given his life for those kids she testified

short name y is for youth he went on for about 30 minutes and 
then its a altruism 
bush relates that by the time the speaker has gotten through the 
four letters of yale an hour and a half has gone by and there 
was only one person left his head bent in prayer 
well sir i see that you are praying for these values the 
presidents story goes the man said no no i wasnt praying 
for the values i was giving thanks that i did not go to alcorn 
state university 
thats how he told it at alcorn state in lorman miss the 
other day later he gave the same joke at mississippi state in 
starkville but the punchline was no sir i was giving thanks 
that i didnt go to mississippi state university 
then bush ran into trouble as he finished his speech he said 
my friends youve worked hard and studied hard and struggled for 
four years and now youve endured the hardest part listening to 
the commencement address 
and i havent even begun lets see ymis 
bush does better on sports than on spelling 
the captain of the 1948 yale baseball team told texas aampm 
graduates when you look back at your days at texas aampm you will 
have a lot to be proud of a university that is first in baseball 
and first in service to our nation 
at alcorn state bush said the alcorn braves know that you 
cant steal second base and keep one foot on first he paused a 
bemused expression crossing his face as he mulled over the line 
thats profound he said 
and at mississippi state bush declared ive been lucky a 
wonderful wife and five great kids five kids and 11 lively 
grandkids and by themselves they could field the bulldogs entire 
pitching staff 
bush surveyed the stadium audience and i understand you 
people with the earphones staying plugged into the baseball game 
if i were sitting up there id be doing exactly the same thing 
he said 
bush also has been sneaking the new breeze he talked about 
in his inaugural address into his college speeches he told texas 
aampm seniors that a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and 
cities of the soviet union 
at alcorn state he said politics is hardly the only arena 
where a new breeze is blowing some of you will land in business 
maybe even start a business where you can create jobs adding to the 
opportunity of other americans 
at texas aampm bush gave what was billed as a major foreign 
policy speech on ussoviet relations but he was apologetic about 
it telling his audience it had to happen your last day in 
college had to end with yet another political science lecture 
bushs wife barbara has also been spending time on campus 
the other day smiling in a black cap and gown at commencement 
at bennett college in greensboro nc she recalled her advice to 
her own children clean your plate remember the starving chinese 
dont put that in your ear dont cross your eyes dont 
put that in your mouth you dont know where its been

in addition to sowing seeds of wisdom at college graduations 
bush is also traipsing around the nation planting trees for state 
centennial ceremonies 
however the first tree he transplanted from the white house 
lawn an elm for the grounds of the north dakota capitol at 
bismarck turned out to be infected with destructive gypsy moth 
larvae 
bush is expected to plant more trees in the coming months in 
south dakota montana wyoming and washington state white house 
aides are hopeful they wont harbor the same unwelcome guests

fewer wars were fought last year 
worldwide military spending declined and the global arms trade 
leveled off reversing the warlike trends of the 1980s researchers 
said today 
but ballistic missiles with nuclear capabilities have 
proliferated one of the most disturbing developments of recent 
years said walter stuetzle director of the stockholm 
international peace research institute 
seventeen third world nations have deployed ballistic missiles 
and at least seven more have them or are trying to acquire them 
the institute said in its 1988 yearbook 
speaking at a news conference stuetzle said no effective 
mechanism has been established to control this development 
but the institutes report also said the number of wars fell 
from 33 to 28 and some appeared close to a resolution by years end 
there was a clear break in the pattern of a constant increase 
in the number of major conflicts with which the world had grown 
accustomed during the 1980s the report says 
since world war ii more than 160 regional and civil wars 
defined as involving more than 1000 deaths have been fought the 
530page annual report says 
the institute an independent group funded mostly by the swedish 
parliament monitors developments in weapons trading and arms 
control 
stuetzle a former west german undersecretary of defense wrote 
in the report that 1988 has seen remarkable progress towards a 
potentially more peaceful world and that relations between the 
two superpowers may determine whether existing conflicts can be 
settled 
but at todays news conference stuetzle faulted the united 
states for failing to agree to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
call for nuclear arms talks 
in the last 12 months we have witnessed a tremendous series of 
initiatives by president gorbachev in the fields of arms control 
and reduction he said 
i think its a great tragedy that with a gorbachev in the 
kremlin there is no jf kennedy in the white house he said 
referring to kennedys call to never fear negotiations 
agreements were reached to end hostilities in the iraniraq war 
the conflict between ethiopia and somalia the war between chad and 
libya and in the conflicts in angola and namibia 
moscow began withdrawing troops from aghanistan vietnam 
announced it would pull out of cambodia and fighting subsided in 
nicaragua where usbacked rebels appear to be giving up their 
fight against the leftist government 
also tensions eased between india and pakistan between laos 
and thailand and in internal disputes in uganda 
however civil wars escalated in afghanistan somalia ethiopia 
and burma and iraq used chemical weapons against its kurdish 
minority the report said 
fighting continued in sri lanka and the palestinian uprising 
worsened in the israelioccupied territories fighting intensified 
in southern sudan and the philippines it said 
the united states cut real military spending for the third year 
in a row nato defense spending was down 3 percent from 1987 and 
spending by the warsaw pact countries was unchanged it said the 
soviet union and china were believed to have trimmed spending 
worldwide trade in conventional arms totaled 34 billion 
measured in 1985 prices down slightly from the previous years 
record figure the report says 
the share bought by third world countries dropped from 66 
percent in 1986 to 614 percent last year 
the report says the us share of the global arms market was 28 
percent and the soviets took 38 percent india was the biggest 
third world buyer last year followed by iraq north korea and 
saudi arabia the report says

japan will proceed with plans to develop its next 
jet fighter with the united states but it remains capable of 
producing the plane alone defense agency chief kichiro tazawa said 
today 
he spoke at a televised session of a parliamentary budget 
committee the day after the us senate voted to endorse the 
coproduction agreement but adopted an amendment imposing tougher 
conditions on the flow of us technology 
the state department said the amendment which prohibits the 
transfer of advanced jet engine technology to japan may force a 
renegotiation of the pact opponents charge the plan gives japan 
access to advanced us aviation technology that would allow it to 
become a competitor supporters say it creates us jobs and 
maintains usjapan defense compatibility 
while being fully confident in being able to develop the plane 
ourselves we will proceed with joint development with the goal of 
producing the best possible new fighter jet tazawa said 
other defense agency and foreign ministry officials declined 
comment saying tuesdays vote was a domestic us issue 
japan originally planned to develop on its own the fighter plane 
dubbed the fsx us officials then asked japan to buy usmade 
planes to reduce the two countries large trade imbalance 
japanese officials refused saying current us aircraft would 
be unable to meet their defense needs in coming decades the two 
sides then compromised on a coproduction arrangement 
japan was one of the worlds top aircraft makers in world war 
ii but us occupation authorities shut down its aircraft industry 
for seven years after the war 
in the 1960s japan produced a commercial airliner the ys11 
that was regarded as a technical success but a marketing failure 
it also developed its current jet fighter the f1 
japan builds domestic versions of the f15 fighter jet and p3c 
antisubmarine plane under license from us manufacturers 
many aviation industry analysts believe development of future 
commercial airliners will require international cooperation because 
of the huge cost complexity and risks in one such arrangement 
japan produces portions of the fuselage for the boeing 767 
passenger jet

seven years after the green river serial killer 
claimed his first victim the police task force formed to track the 
slayer is slowly being phased out a sheriff said no arrests have 
been made 
the killer the subject of a nationally syndicated television 
show in december is officially blamed for the deaths of as many as 
48 young women many of them prostitutes between the summer of 
1982 and early 1984 four victims were found in oregon but the 
killer operated primarily in the puget sound area 
the task force which totaled more than 40 people including fbi 
agents at its peak now comprises eight detectives two sergeants 
and two desk clerks kirotv reported tuesday night 
king county sheriff james montgomery said police officers once 
assigned to the nations worst unsolved serial murder case were 
needed elsewhere to fight the countys rising crime rate 
although montgomery said the task force is gradually being 
phased out he did not say when it might be disbanded completely 
i suspect itll be one of those days when well just simply 
say where did it go the sheriff told the tv station 
in july 1988 when the task force numbered about 20 officers 
montgomery said he would recommend reducing it by mid1989 unless 
there were fresh leads in the case 
capt bob evans commander of the task force said two months 
ago that the tv movie manhunt a chance to end the nightmare 
produced 3500 telephone tips and yielded arrests in two other 
cases 
montgomery said the task force reduction does not make any 
statement at all about what we feel about the victims its a 
matter of we have to continue on with whats going on in this 
particular region today 
the case takes its name from the green river in south king 
county where the bodies of the first five victims were found in 
the summer of 1982

more than 1 million people demanding democracy 
and supporting student hunger strikes marched triumphantly through 
beijing streets today in the biggest protest in communist chinas 
40year history 
two student representatives met later with government and party 
officials and said they were optimistic an agreement would be 
reached soon on their demands which include formal talks with the 
government to be broadcast live 
the protest began after student leaders rejected communist party 
chief zhao ziyangs appeal that 3000 students end a fourday fast 
that has been the catalyst for this weeks unrest 
todays huge march through the streets of the capital was the 
biggest of the prodemocracy rallies that have embarrassed the 
government during mikhail s gorbachevs historic visit and forced 
major changes in his schedule 
the protest was dominated today for the first time by workers 
rather than students the march began in central tiananmen square 
the site of the hunger strike to the sound of firecrackers set off 
under the huge poster of mao tsetung at the entrance to the former 
imperial palace 
protesters draped banners from the rostrum over the gate where 
mao declared the founding of the peoples republic on oct 1 1949 
many banners called for the retirement of 84yearold senior leader 
deng xiaoping and the resignation of premier li peng 
fifty taxis stuffed with flagwaving passengers led a procession 
of workers journalists government employees and even soldiers 
smaller marches headed outward from the square chinas symbolic 
center of power while more people streamed on bicycle and foot 
toward the square which has been clogged for four days by 
protesters 
most streets in the center of this city of 10 million people 
were clogged police made no effort to intervene and few were seen 
on the streets 
chinese arent stupid said marching journalist shen 
yinghua you can suppress us for a long time but when we blow 
we spit fire 
later in the day two students met with the secretaries of zhao 
and li 
tonight we could have some good news said one of the 
student representatives cheng zhen 
students also agreed that police would help direct snarled 
traffic and clear paths for ambulances in streets jammed with 
marchers police began guarding shopping areas to prevent possible 
looting 
the students prepared an open letter to the citys residents 
urging they refrain from any violence 
as prodemocracy protesters massed in the square this morning 
gorbachev met with academicians in the adjacent great hall of the 
people 
the protests forced him to cancel a visit to the imperial 
palace the latest in a series of schedule changes they have forced 
all these rallies made us nervous gorbachev said in an 
interview broadcast by chinese television but he said his visit 
which has produced a normalization of sinosoviet relations after a 
30year chill was going well 
similar demonstrations grew in size today in shanghai where 
gorbachev is scheduled to fly thursday at least 70 student 
hungerstrikers lay in front of the shanghai city hall while about 
20000 students and supporters gathered around to chant for the 
resignation of shanghai mayor jiang zemin many of the students 
later marched across town 
an american witness said the shanghai protest began tuesday and 
grew today police cordoned off the area and tried to keep out 
nonstudents but thousands of workers managed to join them 
smaller marches were reported in shenzhen and guangzhou both 
near hong kong 
in beijing laborers marched with banners naming their 
factories at least 1000 soldiers joined the protest their 
banners identified them as from the general staff office logistics 
department and political department 
were just regular soldiers we want democracy and freedom 
too said a lieutenant 
employees from at least five government ministries participated 
as did 300 representatives from capital steel marching under a 
banner that read return us our freedom 
some postal workers declared themselves on strike and marched 
and there were unconfirmed rumors of other strikes but most 
workers said they would be back at work thursday 
in tiananmen square the strikers lay under umbrellas and tents 
fashioned from sheets for protection from the sun at one point 
they recited their hungerstrike vow with those able to standing 
up 
by this afternoon 1300 strikers had been sent to hospitals 
after fainting however many came back after being revived and 
given glucose 
marchers were concerned particularly with 10 hunger strikers who 
have refused to drink water since early tuesday and three who began 
refusing water late tuesday 
in a message delivered to hunger strikers after midnight on 
behalf of the top communist party leadership zhao affirmed the 
students patriotic spirit but asked that they end the strike 
he promised that protesters would not face punishment and vowed 
to work out concrete measures to enhance democracy and law and 
oppose corruption according to a report by the official xinhua 
news agency 
zhao initially rejected demands for a dialogue with officials to 
be broadcast live but student leaders said they were optimistic 
their demands would be met following the second meeting with 
officials today 
the effect of the protest on chinas political makeup is not 
yet clear although some student leaders claim a communist party 
official has warned that the strike could damage the position of 
the socalled liberal faction that supports marketoriented 
economic reform 
but one student said the fasters are not starving here simply 
to help some old man get more power we are here for our whole 
country we want to go beyond factions

a court today convicted mohammed 
ali hamadi of air piracy and murder and sentenced him to life 
imprisonment in the 1985 twa hijacking that left a us navy diver 
dead 
he received the maximum penalty under west german law 
the threejudge district court convicted the lebanese shiite 
moslem for his role in the 17day hijacking of 39 americans and the 
brutal beating and shooting of robert dean stethem of waldorf md 
stethems body was tossed from the plane onto the tarmac at beirut 
airport 
in a statement following the sentencing stethems parents said 
hamadi should have received the death penalty which is not allowed 
under west german law they also warned against any political deals 
that might free him early 
hamadi 24 admitted to taking part in the hijacking of flight 
847 from athens to rome but denied killing stethem 
he looked straight ahead impassively as chief judge heiner 
mueckenberger read the verdict to a packed courtroom inside 
frankfurts fortresslike preungesheim prison 
mueckenberger said the court found hamadi guilty of joint 
participation in murder by law a defendant taking part in a 
serious crime may be convicted of murder even if he does not 
actually kill the victim 
he was an active member of hezbollah the judge said 
referring to the proiranian shiite moslems believed holding 
foreign hostages in lebanon 
the court also found hamadi guilty on three counts of 
hostagetaking and inflicting grevious bodily harm and two counts 
of smuggling explosives into west germany 
hamadi testified that the hijacking was intended to force the 
release of lebanese moslems imprisoned in israel shortly after the 
ordeal israel released about 700 such prisoners 
dozens of former passengers said hamadi was one of two hijackers 
who brutally beat stethem he claimed his accomplice who remains 
at large pulled the trigger court records identified the 
accomplice as hassan ezzeddine 
mueckenberger said that while the court could not determine 
whether hamadi murdered stethem the defendant played an active 
role in preparing and carrying it out 
after sentencing hamadi hung his head then stared straight 
ahead 
later stethems father richard stethem his wife patricia at 
his side read a statement to reporters breaking the silence they 
maintained throughout the trial they attended all 65 sessions 
our family maintains mohammed ali hamadi deserves punishment 
more severe than life imprisonment richard stethem said he also 
warned against a possible political commutation of his sentence 
in the future 
any commutation of hamadis sentence would be a pure mockery 
of justice stethem said 
last week frankfurt lawyer rainer hamm said the stethems were 
concerned that kidnappings or other types of blackmail might 
lead west german authorities to release hamadi early hamm 
represented the american coprosecutors 
peter korneck a trial prosecutor said hamadi could first apply 
for parole in 15 years but that he would have to meet numerous 
conditions to be granted freedom 
security outside the courtroom was tighter than it had been for 
much of the 10month trial in which more than three dozen 
americans including pilots and passengers testified 
during the hijacking flight 847 was forced to fly three times 
to beirut and twice to algiers algeria stethem was killed when 
the plane landed the second time in beirut on june 15 1985 
another navy diver clinton suggs of elkhart ind and 
passenger kurt carlson of rockford ill were among the most 
viciously beaten 
the hamadi case strained relations between the united states and 
west germany after hamadis arrest bonn denied a us extradition 
request after two west german businessmen were kidnapped in beirut 
the two were taken hostage within a week of hamadis arrest at 
frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 when customs officials found 
liquid explosives in his luggage 
hamadis brother abbas hamadi was convicted of masterminding 
the kidnappings to force mohammeds release he was sentenced to 13 
years in prison by a duesseldorf court 
the west german hostages alfred schmidt and rudolf cordes were 
released in september 1987 and september 1988 respectively 
the hamadi trial began on july 5 officials spent 63 million 
to convert the dining hall at preungesheim prison into a 
highsecurity courtroom with an elaborate intercom system and 
double glass walls to separate spectators from the courtroom 
those entering the courtroom were repeatedly searched and 
dozens of armed police some mounted on horses and others carrying 
submachine guns patrolled the area

the parents of a us navy diver 
slain during a twa hijacking said today the court that convicted 
mohammed ali hamadi of air piracy and murder should have sentenced 
him to death 
after the court sentenced hamadi to life in prison the parents 
said they hoped hamadi would be forced to serve the full sentence 
their son 23yearold robert dean stethem was brutally beaten 
and shot to death when the plane was hijacked to beirut in june 
1985 
richard stethem his wife patricia at his side read a statement 
to reporters after the sentencing breaking the silence they 
maintained throughout the 10month trial the parents attended all 
65 sessions 
they indicated they were disappointed that hamadi a lebanese 
shiite moslem could not receive the death penalty under west 
german law life in prison is the maximum sentence 
our family maintains mohammed ali hamadi deserves punishment 
more severe richard stethem said he also warned against a 
possible political commutation of his sentence in the future 
we mention this because the thought of such a release is 
painful for us to think of any commutation of hamadis sentence 
would be a pure mockery of justice stethem said 
last week frankfurt lawyer rainer hamm said the stethems and 
the other 17 americans who helped prosecute the case were concerned 
that kidnappings or other types of blackmail might lead west 
german authorities to release hamadi early hamm represented the 
american coprosecutors 
in the statement richard stethem said we would hope any 
release would result in a public outcry by german and american 
citizens alike and would cause people to express outrage against 
this type of political injustice 
we would expect our present administration state department 
department of justice and congress to monitor the fulfillment of 
this sentence and to ensure it is completely served stethem 
said in a conference room at the frankfurt prison where the trial 
was held 
he indicated however that he was satisified with the result so 
far 
we feel the german courts conducted a fair and impartial trial 
resulting in an appropriate finding of guilt we have remained 
confident that with the conclusion of the many testimonies of the 
american witnesses nothing less than a life sentence would 
result stethem noted 
the hamadi case strained relations between the united states and 
west germany after hamadis arrest bonn denied a us extradition

parliament approved laws today that 
guarantee freedom of worship and give legal status to the roman 
catholic church formally ending the communist states fourdecade 
struggle with the church 
passage of the three bills is expected to clear the way to 
formal diplomatic ties with the vatican which for years has 
refused to grant relations until the polish churchs legal status 
was resolved 
if ties are normalized it would make poland the first east bloc 
country to have such relations with the holy see 
the bills were introduced last month by prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski and they passed without serious opposition 
in the sejm or parliament 
one bill defines the states attitude toward the church as a 
sovereign organization operating within the constitution but free 
to manage its internal affairs it passed the 460member sejm with 
two votes against and 12 absentions 
a second bill grants equal rights to all denominations bars 
discrimination based on religion and guarantees freedom of worship 
three lawmakers voted against it and three abstained 
the third bill entitles clergy to state oldage pensions it 
passed with seven votes against and 10 abstentions 
the legislation was drafted as a result of protracted 
negotiations between the roman catholic church and the government 
more than 90 percent of poles consider themselves catholic and 
in recent years the state had abandoned atheistic propaganda and 
sought to portray itself as tolerant of religious faith 
the laws passed today in effect replace an agreement between 
church and state that existed before world war ii but was abrogated 
when communists took power after the war 
we have been waiting for this law for 37 years said marek 
pernal a spokesman in the episcopate press office in warsaw 
in the 1940s and 1950s church property was seized and clergy 
were arrestd the roman catholic primate at the time cardinal 
stefan wyszynski was held prisoner for three years from 1953 to 
1956 
since former krakow archbishop karol wojtyla became pope john 
paul ii in 1978 the state has moved to patch up relations with the 
church seeing it as a stabilizing factor in the countrys often 
volatile politics 
church officials were instrumental in helping to set up the 
talks that led to the accord that legalized the solidarity trade 
union and allowed opposition participation in elections 
some poles recently have expressed concern about the degree of 
church influence in public life the church supports a bill before 
the sejm that would make abortion a crime punishable by three years 
in prison abortion has been legal in poland since 1956

mikhail s gorbachev today promised a new era of 
peace in the far east said the red army would reduce its forces in 
the area and urged washington to pull its soldiers out of south 
korea 
as the soviet president spoke a mighty flood of more than 1 
million chinese poured into the streets to demonstrate for 
democratic reforms in china and took control of the center of 
beijing 
in his speech to chinese academics in the great hall of the 
people gorbachev said the 4300milelong sovietchinese frontier 
should be turned into a border of peace 
gorbachevs historic visit to beijing is to normalize relations 
after a 30year chill between the two largest communist countries 
at the news conference later gorbachev defended socialist 
countries experiencing unrest as they try to reform their systems 
if anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history 
i think they will be disappointed again gorbachev said 
the news conference was delayed because it was moved to another 
location to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marching protesters 
i would not try to assume the role of a judge gorbachev 
said when asked about the student unrest 
but he stressed that such problems reaffirm the fact that 
changes under way are of a profound nature 
some regard this as a crisis of socialism he said 
problems he said may bring some pain but we will stay the 
course of democratic reforms 
he made a point of acknowledging receipt of a letter from the 
students who led the demonstrations saying it was a very warm 
letter full of feelings of support for perestroika gorbachevs 
reform program 
during a trip outside the city to visit the great wall 
gorbachevs motorcade passed waves of demonstrators making their 
way in trucks buses by bicycle and on foot toward downtown 
within hours central beijing streets were crammed with 
students workers teachers and journalists swelling out of central 
tiananmen square into the streets to march for democracy 
gorbachev and his wife raisa canceled plans to tour the 
forbidden city because of the large crowds 
the soviet leader said at the news conference today that he 
got a little emotional from the warmth of young people he met 
during a visit to the great wall today but im human he added 
that i feel those three decades were as if they never were 
in his speech a day after the first sinosoviet summit since 
1959 gorbachev called for a regional security network in asia that 
would provide a means of settling disputes 
and he said an earlier pledge to withdraw 200000 troops from 
asia would be fulfilled by the end of 1990 and would include the 
pullout of 12 divisions or 120000 soldiers from the china 
frontier 
the soviet union is believed to have 600000 troops along the 
chinese border the chinese armed with older equipment have more 
than 1 million troops stationed there 
gorbachev said 11 air force regiments would be disbanded and 16 
warships removed from the pacific fleet 
gorbachev added that the soviet union is prepared to work for 
the withdrawal on terms to be agreed with china of military units 
and armaments from the border areas leaving only the personnel 
required for performing routine border guard duties 
demilitarizing the sovietchinese border and turning it into a 
border of peace and goodneighborliness is a noble goal that we 
could attain through joint efforts he said 
on tuesday in a meeting with premier li peng gorbachev said 
we want the sovietchinese border to be protected only by 
friendship he also called for regular consultations between the 
militaries of the two countries 
the two sides fought a brief border war over the disputed 
frontier in 1969 and sporadic clashes have continued for years 
on monday the day gorbachev arrived in beijing moscow began 
pulling troops out of mongolia the soviet ally along chinas 
northern border the kremlin has said it will withdraw 50000 
troops threefourths of the soviet force in mongolia by the end 
of 1990 
senior leader deng xiaoping who heads chinas military also 
has reduced the peoples liberation army from more than 4 million 
in 1985 to about 3 million today most of those troops are 
stationed along the soviet border and chinas volatile border with 
vietnam 
china and other asian nations have been cool to gorbachevs 
concept of collective security in asia expressing fear it is a 
soviet attempt to increase its strategic influence in the area 
on tuesday the two sides announced the normalization of 
government and party relations ending a 30year rift caused by 
ideological and strategic differences and disputes over soviet 
actions in afghanistan and cambodia 
the summit brought the leaders of the soviet union and china 
together for the first time since a frosty encounter between nikita 
s khrushchev and mao tsetung in 1959

greek and turkish cypriot forces today 
abandoned 24 military posts along the line that divides nicosia 
complying with a un plan for easing tensions in the capital 
maj gen clive milner the canadian commander of the un force 
that has been on the mediterranean island since 1964 said the 
limited disengagement was an important first step toward 
reducing the chances of confrontation 
a un statement said the greek cypriot national guard and the 
turkish cypriot forces each pulled out of 12 observation posts in 
three sectors along the dividing green line 
in some sections of the buffer zone rival forces were only a 
few yards apart 
government spokesman akis fantis said the withdrawal was a 
first step toward the full demilitarization of nicosia 
cyprus has been devided since july 1974 when the turkish army 
invaded after a coup by militant greek cypriots seeking unity with 
greece 
the turks seized the northern third of the island the minority 
turkish cypriots 18 percent of the 650000 population declared a 
breakaway republic there in 1983 
milner said todays nicosia withdrawal will help prevent 
incidents and reduce tension in the city 
it follows a sharp increase in violence along the 112mile 
buffer zone that slices the island in two the zone is patrolled by 
2180 soldiers from nine countries in the un force in cyprus 
a greek cypriot national guard soldier shot and wounded a 
turkish cypriot soldier on the green line in nicosia on may 7 then 
killed himself 
five people were killed by gunfire between may and december last 
year the same number of fatalities reported between 1976 and last 
may 
the limited pullback came amid reunification talks that are 
making little headway between president george vassiliou the greek 
cypriot leader and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash 
the government was expected to begin repairing 60 houses around 
the abandoned posts to encourage greek cypriots to return to the 
longdeserted area

a 12yearold boy pleaded guilty today 
to murder and arson charges in a new years eve fire that killed 
his baby sitter 
scott james clutched a handful of baseball cards and frequently 
grinned at his attorney after changing his plea in district court 
assistant attorney general eric wright had originally charged 
the boy with juvenile charges of murder under three theories and 
agreed to dismiss two of the counts today in exchange for the 
guilty pleas 
james told judge alexander macnichol that he started the fire 
that killed raymond r lauzon 53 of biddeford but disputed the 
prosecutions contention that he told his younger brother he wanted 
to see what it was like to kill the man 
wright said the youth who was 11 at the time started the fire 
after lauzon caught him trying to steal some money from his wallet 
the boy and his brother jason were staying in lauzons apartment 
while their mother janet sullivan went to a pub with lauzons son 
ronald 
the judge ordered james returned to the maine youth center in 
south portland pending a may 30 disposition hearing 
under the maximum sentence james could be incarcerated until he 
is 21 but wright told reporters he hopes something can be done to 
help the youngster 
we hope that something good will come out of it for him he 
said

loyal troops defeated rebellious 
soldiers and reestablished control over the capital today but 
thousands of soldiers in the north reportedly joined leaders of a 
coup attempt 
president mengistu haile mariam cut short a state visit to east 
berlin and was on his way home this afternoon the east german 
state news agency reported as the second day of the revolt drew to 
a close 
two dissident generals were killed tuesday in the rebellion 
which began after mengistu left addis ababa for east berlin 
ethiopian state radio said the ethiopian leader of 15 years was 
scheduled to return home thursday 
there were unconfirmed reports that the defense minister maj 
gen haile giorgis habte mariam was slain by dissident officers 
early in the revolt but the radio made no mention of his death 
in addis itself its increasingly looking like a failed coup 
but it appears to be a very different story in other parts of the 
country and especially in the north said a western diplomat in 
the capital its a very fluid situation 
government broadcasts from addis ababas closed bole 
international airport warned commercial and private pilots not to 
fly over northern asmara city capital of the eritrean province 
that has been in revolt against the government for 28 years 
asmara is the headquarters of ethiopias 2nd army consisting of 
150000 soldiers diplomats believed many of them were siding with 
coup leaders ethiopia has africas largest and most wellarmed 
army but many of its quarter of a million soldiers are unwilling 
conscripts 
were just not sure whats going on in asmara whether the 
army has handed its arms to the eplf the rebel eritrean peoples 
liberation front or whether it remains a viable unified force in 
opposition to the government the diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity 
even as addis ababa radio was saying the revolt had been 
crushed another radio station was claiming victory for dissident 
soldiers 
the second station broadcasting on a frequency normally used by 
the government radio station in asmara said the government had 
been overthrown and called on the armed forces to unite behind the 
coup leaders 
the second day of the revolt dawned with a pitched tank and 
artillery battle at an old abandoned airport on the outskirts of 
addis ababa which houses a number of military compounds 
it was thunderous said the diplomat you could feel 
buildings shaking here in the city 
after that things calmed down for a while but then there 
were several fairly severe firefights around town what we think 
was happening is that loyal troops were flushing out insurgents who 
were in hiding 
by midafternoon the city appeared calm again said the diplomat 
but the situation is obviously quite tense and the army is 
everywhere around the city 
all offices shops and schools in the capital were closed state 
radio urged citizens to remain in their homes key government 
offices were heavily guarded 
an african military attache based in addis ababa said the army 
garrison in harar in eastern ethiopia also was supporting the 
coup attempt and that negotiations were under way in the capital 
between loyalist and dissident military leaders 
things are bad the attache said it is just that they 
the government are not saying 
addis ababa radio made no mention of the new fighting around the 
capital this morning throughout the day it repeated a communique 
from ethiopias state council reporting the deaths of two coup 
leaders 
maj gen merid negusie the chief of staff and maj gen amha 
desta commander of the air force were killed by loyalist troops 
in the early hours of the revolt it said 
there have been persistent reports of military unrest in 
ethiopia especially among field commanders who reportedly feel the 
government has not supported them adequately in the northern civil 
war 
some conspiring generals wanted to create great unrest and 
disturbance to shed the blood of innocent people and generally 
destabilize the unity of our motherland even though their 
treacherous aims did not succeed addis ababa radio said 
they tried to use force but were killed the broadcast said 
most of the conspiring generals have been forced to surrender 
it gave no further details 
the military deposed emperor haile selassie in a coup on sept 
12 1974 and a provisional military government was established 
after fighting between factions in the armed forces mengistu then 
an army major came to power and set up a government that is the 
soviet unions strongest ally in africa 
mengistu inherited the northern rebellions recently his forces 
have been all but forced out of eritrea and tigre in a series of 
humiliating defeats at the hands of the separatist eritrean 
peoples liberation front and the tigrean peoples liberation 
front which wants more autonomy

tropical storm brenda swept across 
the central philippines today with winds up to 63 mph killing at 
least two people forcing hundreds from their homes and disrupting 
air service 
the two victims died when their motor launch the albert 
capsized tuesday in stormy seas 200 miles east of manila coast 
guard lt anacleto limbo said the two bodies were recovered today 
and 13 passengers were missing 
limbo said the coast guard also received a distress signal from 
a cargo vessel the zambales which reported it was sinking off 
mindoro island 
he said the message gave no word on the number of crew members 
and it was unclear if the vessel actually sank limbo said the 
search was hampered because coast guard vessels had taken shelter 
from the storm 
another boat the 46ton corazon ii sank while berthed at the 
tabaco town pier in albay province there were no reports of 
casualties in the incident 
brenda came ashore early today on samar island and passed about 
10 miles south of the capital after sunset 
the manila weather bureau said that at 10 pm brenda was 
spotted over the manila bay on the way out to the south china sea 
brenda which was packing 63 mph winds as it neared manila 
weakened slightly to 59 mph and was moving west northwest at 12 mph 
there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties on land 
but the storm knocked out communications to rural areas disrupted 
electric power and caused huge traffic jams on manilas flooded 
streets 
philippine airlines canceled 50 domestic flights and the coast 
guard prevented at least six ships from leaving the port of manila 
airport officials said a cathay pacific flight returned to hong 
kong after trying unsuccessfully to land in manila three times 
philippine air lines flights from singapore tokyo and sydney 
australia were diverted to cebu 350 miles southeast of the 
capital 
as the storm approached the officials expanded storm warnings 
to cover all of luzon island the weather bureau warned residents 
of coastal areas to watch for giant waves or storm surges a 
weather bulletin also warned of possible flooding in low areas 
storm warnings had also been raised over much of the central 
viasayas islands but there were no immediate reports of casualties 
or damage from either samar or masbate 
the philippine long distance telephone company said circuits to 
the effected areas were down damage and casualty reports from 
storms often take days or weeks to reach manila because of poor 
communications

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
may 10 
the daily journal elizabeth nj on stricter public housing 
rules 
jack kemp secretary of the department of housing and urban 
development issued new and controversial federal leases 
that allow the swift eviction of drug users and sellers from public 
housing 
opponents claim the new leases will be no more effective than 
present rules and will create a new wave of homeless 
for instance under the rules an entire family could be evicted 
if a 14yearold son were arrested for smoking marijuana 
however kemps accelerated eviction process protects 
against arbitrary or unfair removal by providing a state court 
hearing 
no one claims the new rules are a panacea for this horrible 
social problem but they are intended to protect people who live in 
public housing from being condemned to lives made miserable by the 
drug trade

the journalbulletin providence ri on panama 
general noriega wasted litle time last week in protecting his 
bad name 
after massive and illdisguised efforts to steal the previous 
weekends election his puppet government declared the outcome 
void and his personal shock troops who call themselves the 
dignity battalion embarked on a rampage choosing their victims 
with extraordinary care 
president bush is sending additional troops to the canal zone 
ostensibly to protect american lives and interests 
our worry is about subsequent steps if the united states has no 
intention of taking military action against the noriega regime 
then a show of force may be very easily transformed into a 
demonstration of weakness 
let us hear from president arias of costa rica winner of 
the 1987 nobel prize for peace 
arias is happy to dispense advice about united states policy 
toward nicaragua we would be interested to know his reaction to 
these remarkable events taking place just next door

the pittsburgh press on janos kadar 
if one man can be a traitor to and benefactor of his people 
that figure is hungarys former communist party chief janos kadar 
who is 76 sick and senile and was kicked out of his last powerless 
post last week 
kadar was a key minister in the government of prime minister 
imre nagy a patriot who led a popular uprising against the soviet 
union in 1956 
kadar then presided over the execution of nagy and other 
former colleagues having their bodies thrown in an unmarked mass 
grave 
nagys body was exhumed in march and will be given a proper 
burial someday when hungary is truly independent a monument will 
be erected in his honor 
perhaps something should also mark the memory of janos kadar 
whose twisted way helped lead to a better hungary 
perhaps half a statue

vicksburg miss evening post on the soviet central committee 
mikhail gorbachevs bloodless purge of the dead souls on the 
soviet central committee is no surprise many of the 110 members 
who were dropped had already been removed from their other high 
party posts 
the surprise was the remarkable candor of gorbachevs public 
speeches he did not attempt to hide his anger and frustration over 
the failure of his economic reforms the states financial 
position is grave 
nor was gorbachev slow in assigning blame wherever personnel 
changes have become necessary they must be carried out without 
the slighest hesitation 
this threat to purge other party and government officials who 
sabotage reforms will have to be liberally carried out in a way 
this latest housecleaning of conservatives is the last of the easy 
purges 
the logical weapons for gorbachev public outrage against local 
bosses and exposure in the news media of corrupt malingerers 
could prove effective the real trick for the soviet leader is to 
find enough local officials who will jump on the reform wagon to 
advance their own careers as in capitalism gorbachev must harness 
enlightended selfinterest and greed

los angeles heraldexaminer on bushs crime fight plan 
mr kinder and gentler just got tougher unfortunately the 
presidents anticrime package isnt particularly smarter 
the halfstep george bush took on the assaultgun ban halting 
the import of the weapons but allowing the manufacture of those 
instruments of death made in the u s of a is drawing 
attention but what it deserves is close scrutiny and revision 
his other proposals arent much better 
he called for building some 26000 more jail cells but 
most prison experts believe the new cells would still be 
inadequate to hold the overflow of criminals in americas federal 
prisons 
bush also proposed an expansion of the number of federal 
crimes punishable by death we support the concept of capital 
punishment but that penalty necessarily carries with it 
significant judicial oversight and review yet the president seeks 
no new funding to increase federal judgeships 
new crime fighting positions would be created including 1600 
more federal prosecutors but again when this new legal power 
begins making its busts where will the convicted criminals be 
locked up 
the nation may not be able to afford the entire 16 billion 
package but he can still do better for instance the assaultgun 
import ban linked with the proposed prohibition against 20bullet 
clips for semiautomatics must be expanded to include the 
americanmade arms as well thats the kind of costfree idea that 
could prove to be priceless in the fight against crime

the journal new ulm minn on a proposed federal tax on 
employee benefits 
the most notorious scheme to emerge from washington at the 
moment is a federal proposal to enact a tax on employee benefits 
its an outrageous idea that goes contrary to more than four 
decades of congressional action meant to spur the increase of 
private benefit plans which greatly reduce the pressure on 
government and publicly funded health care services 
the proposal which would include a tax on employee group health 
insurance and employee group life insurance would hurt millions of 
americans 
if employee benefits are made subject to taxation we can be 
certain that the pressure will mount for a national health service 
something that should be avoided at all cost 
the proposed taxation would become a particular burden on older 
workers and single women in the work force many of them with 
dependents would be severely affected

anderson sc independentmail on oliver norths trial 
considering the undisputed facts in the oliver north case it 
seems to us the jury came in with the best outcome that north and 
his lawyers had any reasonable right to expect 
north admitted to doing things that were technically in 
violation of law for the jury to have averted its eyes to these 
transgressions of law would have been for them to have said it was 
all right to ignore laws that get in the way of the president 
carrying out his policies 
acquitting north on all charges would have had enormous 
constitutional implications that the president and his men are 
above some if not all laws the jury quite sensibly in our 
opinion refused to accept such a constitutional concept 
the fact that the north jury convicted on some charges and not 
on others shows that a lot of weighing and balancing went on in 
that jury room there was plausible evidence for convicting north 
on some charges on which he was acquitted that suggests the jury 
felt as many of us do a kind of sympathy for north as a decent 
if overzealous human being with a very narrow sense of duty 
while we have no desire to see oliver north treated like a 
common criminal we are convinced the jury was right to convict him 
on at least some of the charges by their attention to their duty 
as citizens the americans who were members of the north jury 
demonstrated that the capacity for democratic selfgovernemnt is 
alive and well in this country 
the north jury showed that even among people who pay little 
attention to headline news on a daytoday basis there is a strong 
instinct for the fundamental spirit of our enduring constitution

casa grande ariz dispatch on panama 
president bush is treading a fine line by sending nearly 2000 
combat troops to panama the united states needs to protect 
americans living in that nation and put pressure on the dictator 
gen manuel antonio noriega without antagonizing other latin 
american nations and rallying support for noriega 
noriega suspended the recent presidential election in which his 
handpicked candidate ostensibly was winning but american 
observers said that the opposition candidate guillermo endara 
actually won and the vote fraud that was taking place was all too 
obvious thus causing noriega to call off the farce the american 
observers included former presidents jimmy carter and gerald ford 
and us sen john mccain rariz 
the situation worsened when noriegabacked thugs beat endara 
last week us bases have been opened as a haven to noriega 
opponents and american dependents 
the united states has a great interest in what happens in panama 
because of the need to maintain security for the panama canal 
scheduled to be turned over to panama by the end of this century 
abrogating the treaty giving the canal to panama could cause 
serious problems for american diplomacy 
other latin american nations taking a stand against noriega may 
help in his removal bush is correct in taking action to protect 
lives and trying to facilitate noriegas removal from panama as 
with the case of ferdinand marcos in the philippines one important 
step is finding a place for noriega to go and with his record of 
alleged drug trafficking that isnt easy

the bulletin bend ore on the savings and loans bailout 
congress still is wrestling with the specifics of how the 
government is going to bail out the failed savings and loans but 
it is obvious that the whole mess is going to land in the laps of 
american taxpayers 
grit your teeth because heres what youll pay for the 
expensive promotions and lavish parties sponsored by nowdefunct 
sampls the losses suffered by depositors who eagerly opened accounts 
at high interest rates the sampls could not afford the thousands of 
unwise building projects that cost too much and went broke and the 
failed mortgages that belonged to property speculators who 
defaulted when the texas oil boom went bust 
the latest estimates place the cost of the bailout at something 
between 157187 billion the baltimore evening sun recently 
estimated that the cost is expected to come to about 600 for every 
man woman and child in america over the next 30 years 
thats 2400 for a typical family of four a huge price to 
exact from innocent taxpayers to pay for bad management sleazy 
financial deals and the governments inability to adequately 
regulate this industry

the morning news tribune tacoma wash on soviet defense 
motives 
imagine that us defense policies were decided the way soviet 
policies are without public debate congressional oversight or 
pesky critics 
were that the case the administration could turn every arms 
economy into a propaganda coup the 1990 defense budget for 
example proposes to retire naval warships pare back 
missiledefense reseach cut troop strength and delay the stealth 
bomber program 
everyone knows this is being done to save money but if this 
were a closed society the expedience of the cutbacks wouldnt be 
so obvious the president could stand up in some international 
forum and dramatically present all these reductions as a grand 
sacrifice for world peace 
thats why its best to hold the applause on mikhail gorbachevs 
peace initiatives including his latest offer to unilaterally 
withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from europe as generous as 
these gestures may appear chances are they are prompted by

wausau wis daily herald on the need for small businesses 
the salaries are smaller the employee list shorter and the 
bottom lines dont make cnns business report but running a small 
business has its own kind of perks 
does the chief executive officer of ford know every employee 
personally and does he know when an employee has a baby or a parent 
dies no but owners of small businesses often do 
family members care for each other and notice when someones 
feeling under the weather those are personal benefits that dont 
come in the form of a paychceck but keep people working for the 
same company for a quartercentury or more 
its the small businesses all 17 million of them that hold 
together the nations economy and account for two of every three

the albuquerque nm tribune on the hatch act 
for the second time in two years the house of representatives 
has passed a bill wiping out safeguards against the politicization 
of the federal work force the 1987 bill was killed in the senate 
this time the country may not be so lucky 
under threat is the hatch act which bars federal employees from 
partisan political activism 
does the hatch act infringe on the rights of federal workers 
to freedom of speech the supreme court has repeatedly said no 
a 1973 ruling cited the judgment of history that federal 
service should depend on meritorious performance rather than 
political service 
hatchs intent is clearly not to bully civil servants but to 
shield them from bullying by their superiors and by their 
increasingly powerful union leaders 
even more important the hatch act protects the general public 
if you need to talk with a federal employee about your tax bill or 
social security check you want to be confident that your political 
activities will not influence his decision 
assistant attorney general thomas boyd warns that if the new 
assault on hatch succeeds the nonpartisan enforcement of federal 
law would certainly be threatened and could be extinguished 
president bush should use his heavy artillery including his veto 
power if necessary to prevent that

activists on both sides of the abortion 
debate are giving too much significance to a us supreme court 
justices order blocking a 15yearold girls abortion says a 
lawyer who helped draft the appeal 
justice anthony kennedy decided tuesday to in effect reinstate 
a florida law that requires women under 18 to obtain the consent of 
their parents or a judge before they can get an abortion although a 
state appeals court had ruled it unconstitutional 
his order did not address any legal or constitutional issues 
but merely put off further consideration of the matter until the 
full courts scheduled thursday conference 
attorney hunter limbaugh said the only reason kennedy was asked 
for the order was because he is assigned to the 11th us judicial 
circuit which includes florida 
it isnt because we went justice shopping or that he has made 
a decision on the missouri case said limbaugh referring to 
another abortion case pending before the high court 
the high court could use the missouri case to change its roe vs 
wade ruling that in 1973 upheld the right of women to have 
abortions 
kennedy and justice sandra day oconnor both relative newcomers 
to the court whose views on abortion reman widely unknown are 
considered to be the swing votes in missouris challenge to the roe 
vs wade decision 
earlier tuesday the florida supreme court had suspended a state 
law requiring minors to have a parents or judges consent to an 
abortion until the court rules on the laws constitutionality in 
september 
limbaugh of leesburg assisted lawyer richard boyleston from 
tavares who was appointed to represent the fetus of the 
15yearold central florida girl who challenged the states consent 
law the teenager identified in court documents as tw of lake 
county is 12 weeks pregnant 
i feel optimistic but of course im devastated for my client 
because hours and days are important right now said the girls 
attorney jerri blair of leesburg who was preparing to file a 
response to kennedys order 
some activists had argued that kennedys first order on an 
abortion issue sent a strong signal of his stance on abortions 
before this he was a totally blank slate said attorney 
frank susman who represents an reproductive health services of st 
louis the abortion clinic defending against missouris challenge 
of roe vs wade 
other prochoice supporters said they had expected kennedy to 
vote against abortion rights 
the national organization for women has never doubted that 
justice kennedy is hostile to the constitutional concept of the 
right to abortion and his action today bears out that 
evaluation said now president molly yard 
we are appalled that justice kennedy would stay the decision 
of the florida supreme court to allow the teenager in question to 
obtain an abortion without parental consent 
with this teenager already 12 weeks pregnant each passing 
day has the potential of making an abortion more difficult and 
possibly dangerous if not impossible for the young woman whose 
life has become a judicial football 
antiabortion activists applauded kennedys action 
this shows that unlike some other justices kennedy takes 
parental rights seriously said clarke forsythe general counsel 
of americans united for life in chicago 
were elated said jean doyle executive director of the 
florida right to life in orlando i think its an indication that 
the court has an interest in floridas young people its a good 
healthy sign as far as im concerned 
lawyers at the american civil liberties unions headquarters in 
new york city said the high courts intervention in the florida 
case could have nationwide implications if the justices decide to 
take another look at whether a fetus has legal rights 
the high court decided in roe vs wade that a fetus doesnt have 
the same constitutional rights as a newborn 
there was no basis for appointing a legal guardian for an 
11weekold fetus said lynn paltrow of the aclus reproductive 
freedom project it could have a farreaching trend that every 
pregnant woman might need a guardian for her fetus 
paltrow was referring to richard boylston an attorney appointed 
by a lake county circuit judge after the girl made her request may 
2 
boylston was the attorney who asked kennedy for an emergency 
stay fearing that the girl might get an abortion immediately after 
the state supreme courts decision tuesday allowing the girl and 
other minors to obtain abortions without consent from parents or a 
judge 
parental consent laws in ohio and minnesota also are awaiting 
action by the supreme court 
florida is among 14 states with consent laws but two are 
unenforced and three have been blocked by courts said kathryn 
kolbert an aclu lawyer in new york 
in 12 other states ms kolbert said parents only have to be 
notified about the abortion but that is not enforced in four 
states and courts have blocked the laws in five other states

talks to expand air links between the united states 
and japan failed after tokyo halved a proposal washington had found 
inadequate five months ago a us negotiator said today 
we were taken by surprise said the negotiator who 
requested anonymity 
talks were scheduled to resume in july according to a japanese 
transport ministry spokesman 
us and japanese airlines want to expand service on the 
lucrative and busy passenger and cargo air routes 
seven million passengers traveled between the two countries in 
1988 a 25 percent increase over the previous year and about a 
quarter of all usjapan trade in goods moves by air the official 
said 
in december washington proposed 16 new services for japanese 
carriers and 13 new services for us carriers while japan 
countered with 10 new lines for japanese carriers and six for us 
carriers 
the united states had hoped the two countries would reach a 
compromise the official said but the new japanese proposal was 
for five new japanese services and three new us services he said 
japanese negotiators reportedly said its already crowded 
airports cannot accommodate much expansion 
but the official said japanese airlines have opposed expanding 
us air services and the government wants to protect its carriers 
from competition

congressional leaders and antiapartheid 
activists from south africa urged the bush administration today to 
mount an international campaign to pressure the south african 
government to grant full political rights to its black majority 
speaking in the ornate senate caucus room nobel peace prize 
laureate the rev desmond tutu called on the bush administration to 
take the moral leadership and tighten economic pressures on 
south africa 
your intervention is critical apartheid is destroying our 
land and our people help us please help us tutu told the 
gathering of 80 lawmakers governors academics and businessmen 
tutu and two other activists the rev allan boesak and beyers 
naude issued a proposal in which they urged the united states to 
adopt to prompt the south african government to negotiate 
the plan includes an immediate lifting of the state of emergency 
imposed by the government the release of all political prisoners 
and recognition of the banned african national congress 
naude a white afrikaner said the us administration should 
use the opportunity created by south africas severe economic 
hardships to tighten the screws of trade sanctions on south africa 
without such measures he said the government will never grant 
political rights to the 28 million black south africans 
sen edward kennedy dmass saying that the fight against 
apartheid has become the greatest human rights struggle of our 
time urged the bush administration to work together with 
congress on a new strategy toward south africa 
kinder and gentler does not mean apartheid now is the time to 
move ahead not stand in place he said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he was 
encouraged by the openness of the bush administration as signaled 
by the presence of assistant secretary of state herman cohen at the 
gathering mitchell said congress and the administration agree 
upon the end abolition of apartheid we must now reach agreement 
on the means 
the reagan administration fought and lost a bitter battle with 
congress in 1986 over sanctions on south africa 
kennedy said that instead of rushing to refight old battles 
we intend to seek new possibilities for cooperating with the 
administration in us policy toward south africa 
national party leader fw de klerk who is expected to become 
south africas next leader once president pw botha retires in 
september has called for a new political system in his country 
although he rejects a oneperson onevote system espoused by 
antiapartheid groups 
there has been speculation de klerk may come to the united 
states for a visit later this year 
state department officials say the administration has decided to 
broaden its contacts with south african leaders across the 
political spectrum and that a de klerk visit is possible 
the proposals of the antiapartheid leadership prompted 
publication tuesday of a gallup survey showing most south africans 
oppose international economic sanctions because they believe the 
sanctions lead to joblessness rather than political change 
only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea because 
they would force the government to abolish apartheid six of 10 
blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led the 
government to resign within five years 
the survey of 2192 people 1400 blacks 392 whites and 400 of 
mixed race and asian origin was commissioned by the south african 
chamber of mines representing the countrys mining industry 
of those polled 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of the 
whites rejected foreign sanctions with most saying they would lead 
to higher unemployment 
congress imposed limited sanctions on south africa in 1986 
overriding a veto by thenpresident reagan in an effort to force 
the government to grant political rights to the black majority 
the survey conducted between march 11 and may 8 had a 4 
percent margin of error neil upmeyer research director for 
gallup said that to ensure credibility of the responses 
interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewers 
who were of the same race as the respondent 
in the survey 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of the 
whites and 58 percent of all respondents said american companies 
in south africa can help make the government moderate its racial 
policies 
of those polled 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whites 
said ending american business operations would seriously hurt the 
south african economy

many factories stores and street 
stands were open today though commuter traffic was lighter than 
normal as an opposition general strike to protest the voiding of 
the may 7 election got under way 
some factories are opening and some arent in those that 
open some will come to work and some will support the strike 
said a man standing outside a poultry and egg processing plant in 
an industrial area 
some merchants said they were afraid to observe the strike the 
government of gen manuel antonio noriega declared the strike 
illegal because it has political rather than economic motives and 
said order will be guaranteed 
panamanian military trucks dropped off patrolmen for their 
normal beats but no soldiers were visible at places they are often 
stationed when the government expects trouble 
the strike was also to protest the brutal beatings by noriega 
supporters of the opposition prsidential candidate and his running 
mates 
the oneday work stoppage coincides with the start of a special 
meeting on the panamanian crisis in washington the opposition 
wants the organization of american states foreign ministers to 
recognize its victory in the elections 
the government and the opposition which international 
observers say won the election said they were sending 
representatives to the meeting 
as rush hour began in panama city traffic appeared lighter than 
usual and there were no lines at many bus stops some normally 
crowded buses ran almost empty but gasoline stations were open as 
were many restaurants and markets street vendors sold their wares 
a spokeswoman for the staterun oil company said many office 
workers stayed home but that the companys transisthmian oil 
pipeline was operating normally 
one is afraid of the consequences said a woman who opened 
her downtown office supply store she said two of her four workers 
did not report for work 
the owner of a furniture said he feared reprisals and added that 
business was so bad that to close down again would be fatal 
to frustrate the strike the government set today instead of 
monday as a payday and governmentcontrolled union leaders 
condemned the strike 
the government began continuous jamming of us armed forces 
television tuesday that meant the only television station 
available was one controlled by the government normally the 
government only jams news programming 
meanwhile the us government prepared to evacuate another 
planeload of military personnel and dependents 
on tuesday a jumbo jet chartered by the us air force 
evacuated 238 us citizens in the first of many flights to 
evacuate americans who want to leave 
us air force maj joan ferguson said some of those aboard the 
flight were vacating housing for people living off base who 
president bush had ordered to move onto military installations for 
security reasons 
the united states had been trying to oust noriega for more than 
a year and bush last week ordered 1900 reinforcements into the 
country to beef up the 10000strong us force already stationed 
in panama 
in february 1988 noriega was indicted on federal 
drugtrafficking charges in florida the head of panamas 
15000member defense forces he formerly was a close us ally in 
the region 
noriega denies the drug charges and says they are part of a ploy 
to get rid of him in favor of someone who might abrogate the 
treaties that cede us control of the panama canal at the end of 
the century 
the opposition asked businesses to close today and people to 
stay in their homes until noon when they were to emerge for 
protests by any imaginable means 
a restaurant owner who asked that neither he nor his 
establishment be named said he planned to stay open during the 
strike 
the situation is too rough he said today 
the strike is also aimed at keeping pressure on the organization 
of american states 
the opposition wants the oas to impose sanctions that would 
amount to a political and diplomatic quarantine of panama if the 
government refuses to recognize opposition candidates guillermo 
endara as president and ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford 
as vice presidents 
the opposition claims it won the vote by a 31 margin 
the government claimed a 21 margin for noriega business 
associate carlos duque it said it nullified votecounting on may 
10 because washington had interfered in the political process by 
aiding the opposition the cia reportedly contributed 10 million 
to the opposition campaign 
no new election has been scheduled

aviation officials today were investigating a 
possible violation of flight regulations by the commander of the 
space shuttle atlantis after he reportedly flew his jet trainer 
within 100 feet vertically of a pan am airliner 
navy capt david m walker was flying a nasa t38 plane en 
route to a white house ceremony honoring the atlantis astronauts 
when the incident reported by the airliners pilot as a near 
midair collision occurred monday evening outside washington 
nearcollision reports generally are filed whenever planes come 
within 500 feet of each other and are in danger of colliding 
the national transportation safety board opened a formal 
investigation into the accusation and the faa and the national 
aeronautics and space administration were conducting separate 
inquiries officials said today 
we are looking at a possible pilot deviation faa spokesman 
john leyden said he said air traffic controllers reported the 
alleged deviation after walkers plane descended to 7000 feet 
the same altitude as the airliner when it had been instructed to 
go to 8000 feet 
the faa spokesman said air traffic controllers reported the 
vertical separation between the planes at 100 feet and 
investigators would have to examine recordings of data to determine 
exactly how far apart they were at their closest point 
leyden said possible enforcement action against a civilian pilot 
who deviates from procedures could range from an administrative 
letter to action affecting his license but since walker is a navy 
pilot any conclusion would likely be referred to the military for 
further action 
the incident occurred at about 635 pm monday some five miles 
west of washington dulles international airport in the northern 
virginia suburbs leyden said 
walker contacted at his hotel room in washington on tuesday 
night refused to comment on the report of the near collision 
thats something that i need to probably talk about with the 
faa about not with the news organizations he said im going 
to have to get my information from them before i start talking to 
you all 
nasa spokesman david garrett said walker flew the jet to 
washington to attend tuesdays white house ceremony at which 
president bush honored the shuttle astronauts garrett said he had 
heard reports of a possible close call involving walker but had so 
far been unable to reach the pilot 
leyden explained the pilot of the nasa craft was given an 
8000foot assigned altitude he was descending below his assigned 
altitude of 8000 feet to 7000 feet and that caused him to come 
close to a pan american airbus 310 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon confirmed that the small plane 
crossed the path of pan am flight 140 which had just taken off for 
paris the plane which has 296 seats was carrying 166 passengers 
and a crew of 10 she said 
it had taken off from dulles and was at 7000 feet when it 
reported a t38 aircraft came within what the captain believed to 
be approximately 500 feet of the airbus aircraft said hanlon 
the pilot did not take any evasive action but immediately 
reported the incident to the dulles airport tower said hanlon 
bush honored walker and his fellow shuttle astronauts along 
with two groups of school children who picked the winning name for 
the newest space shuttle 
bush told walker ronald grabe norman thagard mark lee and 
mary cleave who returned may 8 from a fourday shuttle mission 
youve reaffirmed your nations genius in science and technology 
and yet i think we would all agree this really is only just the 
beginning 
the crew on the 29th shuttle flight launched the magellan space 
probe which will orbit venus after an 800millionmile 15moth 
journey and map the surface of earths fogshrouded sister planet 
the pupils from senatobia middle school in senatobia miss 
and tallulah falls school in tallulah falls ga had each 
submitted the name endeavour for the shuttle being built to 
replace the challenger which exploded after its launch in january

parliament today approved the prime ministers 
palestinian election plan after he defeated a challenge by 
rightwing legislators in his likud bloc who argued the plan could 
lead to a palestinian state 
the tally was 43 to 15 with 11 abstaining in a vote of 
confidence in the government that was considered a test for the 
plan fiftyone members of the 120seat knesset or parliament 
were absent for the vote 
the vote followed a sevenhour debate in the knesset and a 
contentious meeting of likud legislators 
the prime minister yitzhak shamir told likud opponents of the 
plan that proplo activists in the occupied lands would not be 
allowed to vote in the elections and insisted israel would not give 
up land to achieve peace 
before the vote shamir played down opposition by leading 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip who have 
called his plan a ploy to cheat them out of a palestinian state 
from the arab side there have been voices of refusal and 
rejection of the whole plan shamir told the knesset we do not 
think these voices are the final word 
the plan approved 206 by the cabinet on sunday calls for 
palestinians in the occupied lands to elect representatives to 
negotiate an interim autonomy settlement with israel 
in tunisia on tuesday the palestine liberation organization 
formally rejected shamirs plan the plo executive committee said 
it denies the palestinians legitimate national rights and 
ignores international resolutionsthat condemn the appropriation 
of anothers territory by force 
in israel today two extreme rightwing opposition parties 
tehiya and moledet submitted motions of no confidence over the 
peace plan 
geula cohen of tehiya told parliament that shamirs proposal 
would cause violent opposition in israel similar to the 17month 
palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation 
if you fail to see the writing on the wall then there will be 
an uprising that will force you mr prime minister to bring an 
entirely new proposal she said 
before his parliament address shamir discussed his plan with 
likud legislators leading likud figures oppose the plan saying it 
would pave the way for negotiations with the plo and the creation 
of a palestinian state 
the initiative states that we shall negotiate with any arab 
who is elected said likud legislator pessah grupper this is 
leading toward negotiations with the plo 
shamir said palestinians involved in plo activity will not be 
able to run in elections or vote it was not immediately clear 
whether he also was referring to palestinians who are sympathetic 
to the plo 
regarding a palestinian state shamir said it wont be and it 
wont be created and whoever says this should his tongue cleave 
to the roof of his mouth 
shamir who repeatedly banged his fist on a table during the 
session with likud said he received plo offers daily for direct 
negotiations but there is nothing to talk about because they 
want a palestinian state 
he said elections would not be held until the palestinian 
uprising has been crushed since the rebellion began in december 
1987 479 palestinians and 21 israelis have been killed 
shamir said palestinians in east jerusalem should not be allowed 
to participate in the elections but told likud members the issue 
was left open 
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing it from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war the united states would like to see 
participation from palestinians in the city

after two years of negotiations turkey 
has accepted a us proposal to modernize an american listening 
station that monitors soviet activities officials said wednesday 
the united states would install a new computer to replace an 
obsolete one from 1960 and build a ground satellite station for 
better communication between the pirinclik listening station and 
the united states said foreign ministry spokesman inal batu 
turkey approved the proposal a few weeks ago he said 
a turkish official who spoke on condition he was not 
identified said the pirinclik station is mainly used for 
monitoring soviet activities in space 
batu said the approval stemmed from turkeys desire to have a 
good start with the bush administration

teachers in the nations secondlargest 
school district began the third day of their strike today with 
both sides disputing reports that a new salary package was under 
consideration 
informal talks between los angeles unified school district 
officials and union leaders ceased and union president wayne 
johnson said today he was mystified by the lack of communication 
i am less hopeful today than i was yesterday johnson said 
both sides awaited the release of a factfinding report later 
today the state factfinder began investigating the dispute in 
march when talks reached an impasse in the 16month contract 
negotiation 
diana munatones a district spokeswoman said the report would 
serve as a focal point for both sides to return to the bargaining 
table 
the sevenmember school board met in executive session for four 
hours tuesday but there were no breakthroughs 
school board president roberta weintraub said they also awaited 
details of gov george deukmejians revised state budget to be 
released thursday to determine if additional state funding will be 
available for teacher salaries 
this board again finds itself in the same dilemma that they 
have continuously been in and that is that until they get some 
better picture of exactly what the dollars are then we can make 
the better decisions than weve been able to make up until now 
ms weintraub said 
teachers are demanding a 21 percent pay increase in two years 
they also want relief from unpaid duties such as playground patrol 
and greater control in choosing curriculum and how money is spent 
the district most recently offered a 215 percent pay increase 
over three years it also has offered to set up councils at 
individual schools so that teachers would have greater input in 
setting curriculum 
the union represents about 22000 teachers counselors nurses 
and librarians striking teachers account for almost twothirds of 
the districts 32000member workforce

interior secretary manuel lujan jr today 
ordered the postponement of an oil and gas lease sale in the gulf 
of alaska and the cook inlet pending further study of the damage 
caused by the spill of the tanker exxon valdez 
lujan scheduled to make the announcement in san francisco said 
in a prepared text that because the proposed sale is near an area 
directly affected by the spill in prince william sound i have 
asked the minerals management service to delay preparation of an 
environmental impact statement until more is known about the impact 
of the spill 
the environmental study was originally scheduled for completion 
in september of this year with the leasing sale scheduled for 
august of 1990 the proposed drilling area known as lease sale 
114 encompasses about 167 million acres located between 3 and 400 
miles offshore in the gulf of alaska and between 3 and 38 miles 
offshore in cook inlet 
minerals management service spokesman tom derocco said that if 
lujan decides next year to proceed with issuance of the 
environmental impact statement the issue would first be reopened 
for public comment 
lujans statement said in particular we will be working 
closely with the governor and local communities to ensure that new 
issues arising from changed circumstances in the region are 
identified before we proceed

the number of people employed by the nations 
cities is on the rise again the census bureau reported wednesday 
cities employed 2541000 people as of october 1987 the bureau 
said thats 47000 more than a year earlier and just 20000 
workers short of the alltime high in october 1980 
the increase in 1987 the most recent figure available 
reflects hiring to provide services to growing city populations 
said alan v stevens head of the governments division of the 
bureaus employment statistics branch 
after peaking in 1980 city employment dropped sharply early in 
this decade after cancellation of the comprehensive employment 
training act which provided federal money for governments to hire 
and train workers a weak economy at that time also held down 
municipal hiring stevens said 
more recently he said cities have responded to improving 
economic conditions and the needs of the times by increasing their 
workforces 
for example while overall municipal employees were up 19 
percent between 1986 and 1987 cityemployed corrections officers 
increaseed 73 percent to 27295 
corrections stevens noted is a fastrising job category for 
states counties and other governments also with the spreading 
drug problem and an increasing emphasis on jailing criminals 
judicial and legal employees of cities also increased sharply 
rising 119 percent to 38609 
the number of cityemployed police officers however was up 
only 17 percent to 312123 the report showed 
overall city governments had 1482 workers per 10000 residents 
as of october 1987

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev urged a 
negotiated settlement of chinas internal turmoil on wednesday and 
said he has met with some of the students leading the huge rallies 
for democracy 
but the soviet leader refused to take sides in the prodemocracy 
demonstrations that have caused major disruptions in his historic 
trip 
the unrest rippling across the country reached a peak wednesday 
when more than 1 million people surged through beijings streets to 
demand reform because of the crowds officials moved gorbachevs 
news conference to the guest house where he is staying 
gorbachev told reporters he had seen the students who launched 
the mass action and had talked to some of them but he did not 
elaborate 
gorbachev who came to china to normalize relations after a 
30year rift said it was not for him to judge who was right in the 
dispute 
i wouldnt take upon myself the responsibility or the role to 
pass judgment and i wouldnt seek to assess what is going on here 
in this country he said i believe this is for the chinese to 
do and for the chinese party 
but the kremlin chief observed that a difficult painful but 
political dialogue is going on between the leadership the youth 
and the public concerning these events and it seems to me that we 
should welcome that fact 
i would only wish that solutions will be found in the process 
of negotiation gorbachev said 
gorbachev who was sent a petition signed by 6000 students 
made a point of noting that he received a very warm letter from 
students that endorsed his reforms in the soviet union i value 
their position and appreciate it he said 
asked what he would do if similar demonstrations occurred in 
moscow gorbachev said he would negotiate 
if problems of a similar nature occurred in the soviet union 
we would discuss those problems within the political process in a 
spirit of democracy and glasnost he said 
several events planned for gorbachev were canceled or 
rescheduled to avoid the huge crowds on wednesday gorbachev and 
his wife raisa were prevented from touring the forbidden city 
just off tiananmen square the sprawling plaza at the center of the 
demonstrations 
gorbachev said he got a little emotional from the warmth of 
young people he met during a visit to the great wall on wednesday

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee chastised the white house today for making belittling 
statements about soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and accused 
administration officials of lacking vision in meeting the 
soviet leaders arms control challenges 
rep les aspin dwis alluded to statements made tuesday by 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater who said the administration 
of leery of gorbachevs promise to halt military aid to 
nicaragua fitzwater also accused gorbachev of throwing out arms 
control proposals like a drugstore cowboy in the effort to win 
attention 
i dont think you ought to run down the gorbachev proposals i 
dont think the kind of statements marlin fitzwater is making are 
helpful aspin told two administration officials at a hearing by 
his committee 
the administration contends that many of gorbachevs 
initiatives such as his most recent offering to get rid of 500 
shortrange nuclear weapons are designed to glean publicity and 
are not actually substantial when viewed against the overwhelming 
superiority in warsaw pact forces in europe 
but aspin argued that the administration was being outflanked by 
the soviet leaders ability to win the public relations war 
particularly among the us allies in western europe 
aspin and several other democrats complained to paul wolfowitz 
undersecretary of defense for policy and reginald bartholomew 
undersecretary of state for security assistance that the 
administration is losing that fight because it has not responded 
swiftly enough to gorbachevs various arms control proposals nor 
with enough imagination 
wolfowitz and bartholomew countered that the administration was 
being cautious in areas where they deemed it was necessary and had 
put forward a serious and farreaching proposals to trim the 
conventional forces in europe which the soviets are now just 
coming around to meet 
but aspin argued that even though the administrations position 
might find agreement among diplomats and the military it wasnt 
winning in the political arena 
you cant beat something with nothing in politics he 
complained you have to give me a better world i can point to 
youve got to have some vision out there and it just aint 
there

a consumers group announced wednesday a 
national campaign to investigate alleged abuses of childlabor laws 
and to pressure governments to improve enforcement of the standards 
the national consumers league also said it would seek to 
determine the impact of increased employment among teenagers on 
education and family and personal relationships 
from the sweatshops in new york to the fast food restaurants 
in california more and more young people are working and often 
illegally said linda golodner the leagues executive director 
ms golodner said the federal labor departments wage and hour 
division is woefully understaffed with just 985 compliance 
officers whose duties including monitoring labor laws 
in most states enforcement staffs are so small they cannot 
conduct investigations only investigate complaints and often are 
discouraged from alleging violations unless there are repeat 
offenses she said 
ms golodner cited a recent massachusetts study that found a 614 
percent increase in child labor violations from 1983 to 1987 and a 
new york report released last week that showed a 95 percent 
increase in violations statewide from 1987 to 1988 with a reported 
487 percent increase in violations in new york city primarily in 
the garment industry 
our goal is to gather information and statistics on child 
labor in this country and recommend change in public policy 
regulation and legislation ms golodner said 
she said the league would work with labor organizations other 
public interest groups and federal and state officials results of 
the review are to be presented at a symposium in may 1990

the senate foreign relations committee today 
endorsed the nomination of michigan republican activist peter f

feared secchia might embarrass the united states because of his 
penchant for making gross remarks 
the committees vote was 130 in favor of secchia a former 
republican national committeeman for michigan and lumber industry 
executive 
the chairman sen claiborne pell dri and sen alan 
cranston dcalif voted present meaning they took no 
position 
pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts 
containing the distasteful specifics of mr secchias remarks 
at his confirmation hearing earlier this month secchia pledged 
to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful 
language than he had been in his different role as a political 
organizer and enthusiast 
but pell said he was unpersuaded 
tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful 
diplomats pell said mr secchia has demonstrated that he 
would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to 
italy 
italian friends of mine telephoned me from rome aghast at the 
prospect of having mr secchia represent the united states in their 
country the chairman said 
i believe that this nomination is a mistake and in all 
likelihood mr secchia will be an embarrasment to the 
administration and the united states pell said 
but he said that since secchia is the presidents choice he 
would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it

organization of american states foreign 
ministers assembled here today for a historic debate on the panama 
crisis with the united states prepared to ask for a resolution 
demanding that gen manuel antonio noriega step aside 
president bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said the white 
house was confident there will be general hemispheric 
condemnation of noriegas actions at the session 
we hope and expect the oas will take a strong stand on panama 
and against the noriega regime fitzwater said adding the united 
states would let other countries take the lead in proposing 
specific motions he said secretary of state james a baker iii 
would speak up forcefully regarding our views 
in panama opponents to noriega called for a oneday general 
strike today to protest the voided elections and the beating by the 
generals supporters of political opposition leaders but many 
factories stores and street stands were open although commuter 
traffic was lighter than normal 
as the delegates prepared for their opening session the united 
states was emerging as perhaps the most militant of the 31 nations 
represented here for the first special oas foreign ministers 
meeting in seven years 
us officials said tuesday the bush administration was ready to 
ask the oas to demand that noriega step down following an election 
10 days ago that the state department claimed was rigged initially 
and then voided when the fraud could not be concealed 
but the preliminary signs for the administration were not 
encouraging because two of the countries thought to be most 
sympathetic to the us view venezuela and peru were proposing 
resolutions that fell far short of us objectives 
neither mentions noriega by name nor recommends that he step 
down 
at his daily white house briefing for reporters fitzwater said 
the administration was not seeking a country where noriega could 
find exile 
there have been a number of countries that have said they 
would accept gen noriega he added at least some of them are 
countries that dont have extradition treaties with the united 
states 
the oas session evoked memories of one 10 years ago when oas 
foreign ministers including thenus secretary of state cyrus 
vance demanded the resignation of nicaraguan president anastasio 
somoza he fled less than a month later 
this year the delegates seem somewhat reluctant to interfere in 
panamas internal affairs to the degree that they did a decade ago 
in nicaragua 
the venezuelan draft calls for the immediate recognition of 
the may 7 electoral returns in panama while asserting that the 
solution to panamas crisis rests exclusively with the panamanian 
people 
a us official said the venezuelan proposal is not plausible 
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since 
most of the ballots have been destroyed 
the peruvian draft calls on the oas secretary general to 
facilitate a dialogue between the panamanian government and 
opposition leading to the election of new authorities 
alternatively other mechanisms would be agreed to that would 
ensure the transfer of power in panama 
while bush administration officials consider both drafts to be 
tepid the decision to raise the events surrounding the panamanian 
election to the highest hemispheric tribunal is seen as a plus for 
us policy 
the united states has been attempting to topple noriega for more 
than a year a policy that panamanian delegates at todays meeting 
are expected to seize on 
based on official statements in recent days panama was 
preparing to accuse the united states at todays meeting of 
systematic violation of panamanian sovereignty in violation of the 
oas charter 
as examples panama was intent on highlighting us economic 
sanctions imposed 14 months ago and the reported 10 million us 
government donation to opposition forces in panama during the 
election campaign 
venezuela requested the meeting after international observers 
contended that the may 7 election was marked by massive fraud 
committed by the pronoriega coalition 
subsequently the results were tossed out after a bloody 
confrontation between armed supporters of noriega and opposition 
demonstrators including presidential candidate guillermo endara 
and a vice presidential running mate guillermo ford 
scenes of the bloodshed were widely disseminated outside panama 
and had a major impact on hemispheric public opinion 
the dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting 
provisions in the oas charter one paragraph calls representative 
democracy an indispensible condition for stability in the 
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to 
outside intervention for any reason whatsoever 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said tuesday 
the administration looks forward to working with governments 
throughout the hemisphere to develop action in support of 
democracy in panama 
indicating that the united states plans a circumspect role at 
the meeting boucher said this is a meeting called by latins 
led by latins and we expect the result to reflect latin interest 
in democracy

federal drug policy coordinator william j 
bennett met with commissioners and player representatives of 
several professional sports today to exchange ideas on ways to 
improve antidrug standards for the country as well as pro 
athletics 
we all agreed on the importance of sports in american life 
bennett told reporters we talked about the effort that 
professional sports has made to get out a good clear message to 
kids about being drugfree and the need to extend these efforts 
and improve on them 
bennett said he was anxious to see professional sports match the 
fervent effort to curb drug use that he has suggested at the high 
school level 
i pressed pretty hard i guess he said i said that from 
my perspective it would seem to me that when talked about being 
tough on high school students and others those policies needed to 
matched at least at the level of professional sports 
no policies were put in place but bennett expressed hope that 
some concrete ideas might come out of a followup meeting to be 
held soon 
most important we have agreed to meet again this summer in a 
month or two so we can have some specific suggestions for the 
national strategy which i am writing bennett said 
among those at the meeting were national football league 
commissioner pete rozelle national basketball association 
commissioner david stern and major league baseball commissioner a 
bartlett giamatti 
steve ryan senior vice president for marketing and public 
relations for the national hockey league was also present nhl

blame it on the movies is an overstuffed 
unoriginal musical revue featuring too many songs from too many 
movies 
the show which opened tuesday at offbroadways criterion 
center stage left forsakes much of the familiar movie musical 
material and concentrates on songs from nonmusical films that 
means a lot of overwrought title tunes from a lot of overwrought 
films such as love is a many splendored thing an affair to 
remember and the long hot summer 
most of this moist music is sung during a segment saluting songs 
from 20th centuryfox movies its the best constructed of the 
evenings half dozen or so long segments the cast of eight singers 
and dancers particularly patty tiffany and bill hutton wring 
out each tear its the most emotion they show all evening 
there are nearly 80 different songs in the revue but most of 
them whiz by in a blur short musical phrases that sometimes seem 
no more than a song title director david galligan wont let the 
show or the performers stop moving what it lacks in style and fun 
it makes up for in speed 
barbara sharma who has a betty boop voice and a pretty good 
woody woodpecker laugh portrays the revues one character an 
usherette who links the various portions of the entertainment 
together theres music from the 1940s a world war ii segment and 
a homage to songs which lost academy awards miss sharma also mugs 
and sings some forgettable new material by veteran revue specialist 
billy barnes 
the performers often sound mechanical their voices not enhanced 
by the theaters tinny sound system the singers work hard but 
there is no spark or spontaneity to their performances 
there is one plus though theatergoers are given boxes of 
popcorn as they enter the auditorium the corn is freshly popped 
and tasty but even it doesnt help after a while watching blame 
it on the movies is like sitting through a bad doublefeature 
with no cartoon

the white house today voiced grave 
concerns over a senate amendment placing new restrictions on the 
usjapanese fsx jet fighter project claiming it could erode 
presidential authority 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush told house 
republicans his administration would work against the amendment 
sponsored by sen robert byrd dwva when the measure gets to a 
housesenate conference 
bush met with gop members in the capitol at midmorning 
earlier the state department said new restrictions imposed by 
the senate on the plan to coproduce the sophisticated new jet with 
japan may force the renegotiation of parts of the agreement 
the senate approved the project on a 5247 vote tuesday but 
then it adopted 7227 byrds amendment to tighten the conditions 
under which codevelopment and coproduction would take place 
bush was very pleased by the overall vote but we do have very 
grave concerns about the byrd amendment fitzwater said 
generally it creates a system of congressional approval over 
these kinds of projects that we consider to be erosive of 
presidential power 
even before tuesdays vote deputy secretary of state lawrence 
s eagleburger made it known that the administration regarded the 
new directives as unneccessary and likely to trigger new and 
lengthy negotiations 
the votes came after two days of debate in which senators 
emotionally and angrily denounced japan for allegedly unfair trade 
competition and sounded warnings that the deal could threaten us 
dominance of the aerospace industry by transferring vital 
technology to japanese industry 
it would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting our 
aircraft industry and the vital technologies associated with it 
byrd said this nation needs to get our economic relationship 
with japan on a saner and sounder track 
the amendment was opposed by the administration and senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas dubbed it a killer 
amendment which would require the reopening of negotiations with 
the japanese government 
byrd said the amendment will not torpedo the deal but will 
provide necessary protection for the united states 
roman popadiuk a bush administration spokesman noted the white 
house had made the senate aware of its objections to the byrd 
amendment in advance of the vote and said there would be no further 
comment until its language was carefully considered 
eagleburger in a letter circulated before the senate action 
said additional restrictions imposed by congress would inhibit 
rather than facilitate the fsx program 
he said the terms of the arrangements with japan are already 
consistent with the content of the amendment and do protect us 
security economic and technological strengths and interests 
implementation of additional conditions which would 
require renegotiation in some cases would not materially advance 
these objectives eagleburger said 
the amendment prohibits the transfer of advanced jet engine 
technology to the japanese in byrds words under any 
circumstances 
it would bar the japanese from selling or transferring fsx 
aircraft technology to third parties 
no one expects the japanese to turn this system into an export 
item and this provision simply makes it impermissible for the 
japanese to use the specific systems they are getting from us to 
enter the international market byrd said 
the amendment also expresses the sense of congress that the 
united states receive no less than 40 percent of the production 
work on the aircraft 
byrd complained that the present arrangement calls for 
approximately 40 percent and said that was too vague and too 
liable to result in future squabbles 
during debate on resolution of disapproval senators repeatedly 
accused japan of taking unfair economic advantage of the defense 
umbrella the united states has provided since the end of world war 
ii 
the united states is the very best friend they have ever had 
in their entire history said sen pete domenici rnm we 
provided a safe haven and a safe world that allowed them to 
flourish beyond anything they ever could have done 
but i dont believe it is the action of an ally a friend a 
partner domenici said for the japanese to refuse to buy the 
existing american f16 fighter off the shelf and to insist 
instead on a halfbaked deal to coproduce an entirely new 
fighter using american technology 
dixon called the arrangement a sucker deal and a 
tragically bad deal for america 
we have a 54 billion trade deficit with the japanese and for 
the one area aerospace in which we have a 19 billion trade 
surplus we want to give it to them on a golden platter 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas told his colleagues it will cost 
japan nearly three times as much per plane to coproduce the fsx as 
it would to buy the f16 clearly japan wants whatever technology 
it can acquire so they can build not just an fsx but an aircraft 
industry 
but dole and sen richard lugar rind who led the fight to 
reject the disapproval resolution said the plan is in the 
interests of the united states for what they said are sound 
military and economic reasons 
they said the present plan originaly negotiated by former 
president reagan and modified by bush gives japan the advanced 
aircraft it will need to fufill defense roles in the late 1990s and 
also will provide a 25 billion benfit to the united states in 
contracts and jobs

the american campaign academy which was 
created to train political professionals does not qualify for a 
federal tax exemption because its work benefits republican 
candidates almost exclusively the us tax court ruled wednesday 
no graduate is known to have affiliated with any domestic 
political party other than the republican party chief judge 
arthur l nims iii wrote for the court 
we find that petitioner the academy operated to advance 
republican interests we also find that the placement of 85 of 
petitioners graduates in the campaigns of 98 republican senatorial 
and congressional candidates in 1986 conferred a benefit on those 
candidates the court concluded 
the academy located in arlington va had applied to the 
internal revenue service for a tax exemption as a charitable 
educational organization the irs rejected the application on 
grounds the academy failed to established that it was operated 
exclusively for taxexempt purposes 
you are operated for a substantial nonexempt private 
purpose the irs had ruled you benefit republican party 
entities and candidates more than incidentally also your 
activities serve the private interests of republican party entities 
rather than public interests exclusively 
the academy appealed that decision to the tax court and lost 
the academy was incorporated in january 1986 as an outgrowth of 
the national republican congressional committee which is composed 
of gop members of the house of representatives funding for the 
academy is provided exclusively by the national republican 
congressional trust 
two of the academys initial directors were joseph gaylord 
executive director of the committee and john c mcdonald a member 
of the republican national committee 
according to court records the academy limits enrollment to 
those aspiring to become campaign managers fundraisers or 
communications specialists although the academy keeps no records 
of political affiliations it acknowledged that a substantial 
number of its students as well as members of its admissions panel 
are affiliated with the gop 
the academy contended that whatever private benefit went to the 
gop was incidental to a broader interest of educating the public 
the court held that the academy was created primarily to further 
gop interests 
had the record established that the academys activities were 
nonpartisan in nature and that its graduates were not intended to 
primarily benefit republicans we would have a different case 
nims wrote we are not however deciding such a case

when teachers grade the yearend essays 
of 50000 louisiana high school sophomores theyll also be reading 
between the lines for signs of personal crisis such as suicidal 
tendencies or child abuse 
the essay portion of the statewide 10thgrade exam will be 
graded by a company that will flag compositions that need to be 
brought to someones attention robert schiller louisiana deputy 
superintendent of education said tuesday 
the education department will send alarming papers to school 
districts where officials will decide whether to intervene 
schiller said 
critics of the plan said it is an invasion of students privacy 
and they questioned whether the testgraders are qualified to 
recognize psychological problems 
officials expect warning signs to crop up in 02 percent of the 
tests or about 100 students the tests were given in april and are 
being graded now 
the supervisor of the states school psychological services jim 
canfield has filed a protest memo calling the practice immoral 
unethical and probably illegal 
the state is required by law to get parental consent before 
using the exams to make psychological judgments canfield said 
their intent may be good but there has to be prior consent 
he said parents dont know that this is happening and if 
nothing else they should be made aware 
measurement inc of greensboro nc has hired 70 people to 
score the tests most of whom have bachelors degrees in english or 
education said rebecca christian assistant director of the 
education departments bureau of accountability 
measurement inc has done similar work for mississippi new 
jersey south carolina and texas 
wendy littlefair project coordinator at measurement inc would 
not discuss the procedure 
the essays ask the student to write about teenage problems a 
format that could give students a chance to express suicidal 
tendencies instances of child abuse or other problems christian 
said 
schiller said the evaluation is legal and part of the states 
moral obligation to protect youngsters 
measurement inc has the capability to flag when there might 
be a particular problem and we are setting up a mechanism whereby 
we might bring it to the attention of local districts he said 
east baton rouge parish school superintendent bernard weiss a 
former english teacher said he had serious concerns about having 
the background to make such an assertion about a child 
i certainly dont feel an english teacher is basically 
qualified to make that kind of determination he said 
keith cruz director of student assessments in texas said some 
papers flagged by the company have been used in court in child 
abuse cases 
its our idea to have the flagging done cruz said its 
made us very proud to provide the school districts with help for 
youngsters

official media were silent when moslem 
guerrillas kept a column of gasoline trucks from reaching kabul 
recently but the currency traders knew about it and moved the 
dollar up against the afghani 
word came two days later that the army had reopened the road and 
the convoy had safely completed the 260mile journey from the 
soviet border the soberfaced men on the bank of the kabul river 
moved the dollar down again 
capitalism flourishes in kabul which was a crossroads for 
merchants and traders many centuries before it became a marxist 
capital 11 years ago 
the money market or serai shazad is conducted in the inner 
courtyard of a balconied building with rusting beams where camel 
trains once sojourned overnight 
traders in turbans count bundles of notes blue beige pink 
pausing occasionally to tend their goats or other animals grazing 
nearby it is no secret that the men who dominate the serai shazad 
are wealthy some of them millionaires many times over 
civil war which began with a communist coup in april 1978 has 
created periodic and sometimes critical shortages of food fuel and 
medicine 
for those with money however the duncolored city is a 
cornucopia 
merchants sell goods from wooden containers at roadsides in 
western kabul business is always brisk in rice flour wheat 
kerosene and other goods taken from supply convoys that do not make 
it through guerrillaheld territory 
the pocked streets and winding alleys of the old bazaar overflow 
with everything from expensive 100yearold carpets and mercedes 
automobiles to japanese videocassette recorders soviet combat 
uniforms and secondhand western jeans 
highways running north to the soviet border and east to pakistan 
are the citys lifeline and what moves on them sets the rhythm of 
the market 
helicopter gunships tanks rockets and artillery are some of 
the tools used to keep them open 
then come lulls in guerrilla activity when convoys rumble into 
kabul without interference juma mohammad a 38yearold money 
changer says some rebel commanders have their price 
ins really quite simple he said there is a road 
somebody controls the road somebody else wants to use the road and 
deals are made its strictly business 
information moves through the money bazaars grapevine as if it 
were an electronic data system and the afghani rises or falls as 
convoys reach kabul or are attacked 
pounds marks francs and nearly all other currencies are traded 
but the dollar is supreme 
dollars sometimes tens of thousands are stacked neatly in 
chipped cabinets in the traders tiny offices on the balconies 
overlooking the trading floor which is dusty or muddy 
depending on the weather 
as mohammad discusses rates on the telephone other traders 
stand nearby listening attentively 
money is not their only business 
we are international businessmen mohammad said we buy and 
sell everythingg i have bank accounts in london geneva and paris 
and i have traveled the world 
like most of his colleagues mohammad is strictly neutral in 
talking about the war 
war is terrible but this is business he said we will 
accept any government that will end this war and leave business 
alone 
mohammad sayeed a colleague observed if we are left to live 
in peace then the success we have will be nothing special we will 
just be rich

another election another 
funeral 
while the populace trudged to the polls to elect its local 
officials on wednesday the people of kilkeel buried malachy 
trainor a carpenter roman catholic and latest victim of 
protestant gunmen 
both events had an air of bleak inevitability the election 
said the pundits would change very little and trainor said his 
bishop was the 34th victim of sectarianism he has buried in his 
diocese since 1982 
trainor 34 was doing a building job in a protestant area of 
belfast on monday when his killers got out of a car and opened fire 
an outlawed protestant organization the ulster volunteer force 
said he was active in the irish republican army his family 
strongly denied it 
the fact that the local police identified his murder as 
nakedly sectarian shows that his only crime was to be a catholic 
bishop cahal daly said at the funeral 
in kilkeel trainors home town of 6500 in the southeast of the 
province the church was packed bright sunshine turned the 
graveyard grass an almost incandescent green the mourne mountains 
towered above their foothills streaked with yellow gorse 
daly wan and stooped delivered a sermon in which he called 
once more for an end to the creeping oil slick of sectarianism 
daly said he could understand the protestants fear of the ira 
but pleaded with them to believe that the roman catholic church had 
no part in the ira campaign to rid northern ireland of british rule 
at the same time he ascribed protestant sectarianism to 
plain oldfashioned unreconstructed antiroman catholic 
bigotry based on outmoded theologies long since left far behind by 
world protestantism 
it was a message he has delivered many times and he knew there 
were those to whom malachy trainor was already just another 
statistic todays news forgotten next week in a cycle of 
conflict nearing its 20th anniversary with more than 2700 deaths 
but that is not true the 71yearold bishop thundered 
one never gets used to this sort of death 
after the service weeping pallbearers carried trainor into the 
churchyard a church bell tolled trainors widow rosetta sobbed 
behind the coffin her face crushed with despair her aged father 
on her arm 
trainor had three children and was about to finish the new 
family home he had built himself 
meanwhile the people of northern ireland got on with their 
election trickling to polling stations to elect 566 councilors to 
northern irelands 26 local governments 
elections in northern ireland rarely amount to more than 
sectarian headcounts the overwhelming majority on both sides of 
the divide vote for the parties of their religious persuasion 
which then wage wars of words in the council chambers 
protestants outnumber catholics 32 in northern ireland and 
will take the majority of the seats so what matters is the 
intracommunity vote whether the iras political wing sinn fein 
will gain or lose against the more moderate catholics of the social 
democratic and labor party and whether on the protestant side 
the larger ulster unionist party will stay ahead of the hardline 
democratic unionist party 
to the irish times in dublin atrocities like trainors murder 
or the ira bomb attached to a belfast lamppost that injured a 
3yearold girl in the foot tuesday night were a reminder to the 
people of the north of the price they pay for political failure 
outside a polling station in kilkeel the sdlp and ulster 
unionists had parked rival caravans festooned with election posters 
at the unionists caravan billy russell spoke in resigned tones 
about trainors murder everybodys disgusted but was quick 
to point out that 11 protestants have also been murdered in the 
district 
next door the sdlps eddie mcgrady conceded the difficulty of 
playing politics in a battlefield 
i get depressed twice a day he said but you have to keep 
going or else if the moderates dont keep going he hands over 
the center ground to the extremists

water dwindled to five on wednesday when seven were hospitalized 
but several escaped from their hospital beds ripping out the 
intraveneous needles and rejoined their classmates by midday 10 
students lay in the shade sheltered by white sheets on bamboo 
sticks 
xiao was one of them 
my people are here and i had to be with them he said 
clutching his left hand swollen when he pulled a needle from his 
vein if we are going to fall we will fall together 
even more than the fasters those students going without water 
have touched a chord among beijing residents of whom more than 1 
million marched wednesday to support calls for sweeping democratic 
reforms 
the government is killing them said one high school teacher 
as he demonstrated with his pupils near the fasting ground 
without water they will die the government knows it must talk 
with them 
on wednesday nurses and doctors hovered near the students 
they all have fevers and we are worried about their hearts 
said one doctor he said nurses were dabbing their heads and lips 
with wet cloths 
as he spoke a siren cut the night and another student was taken 
away seven remained swathed in blankets 
that was xiao ming he is a veteran of our war with vietnam 
that struggle didnt make him fall but this one has xiao said 
students lay under the portrait of a naked man and woman a 
poster reading save me flapped in the wind 
my child you are burning up cried one of their mothers as 
temperatures soared into the low 80s 
by late afternoon the chrysanthemums and roses presented by 
passersby had wilted in the sun 
they are still beautiful xiao said i never thought my 
people would raise their heads

ernest hemingway went fishing in cuba he hooked 
marlin he kept a log a friend typed it up it now belongs to the 
john fitzgerald kennedy library 
ask why and youll get a long story about a writer who liked 
short sentences and a literary president 
much of the log concerns spotting chasing and catching big 
fish but there are also terse observations in which hemingway 
referring to himself in third person records the revolt that 
brought dictator fulgencio batista to power 
on oct 7 1934 he noted havana is full of arms ammunition 
dynamite during the night there was dynamiting in the city and 
shooting on both sides of the harbor eh woke once in the night 
when arnold shouted out and covered the opening in the forward 
hatch with a pistol the maestro was merely hooking fish in his 
dreams 
the novelist and kennedy never met but admired each other 
hemingway was even invited to kennedys inauguration but declined 
because he was in the throes of depression said megan desnoyers 
curator of the collection 
from the 1930s until hemingways suicide in ketchum idaho in 
1961 the writer considered cuba his home but kennedy had ordered 
an embargo against cuba after his enthusiasm for fidel castro 
soured 
so when mary hemingway the writers widow and fourth wife 
needed to collect the things her husband left behind jfk gave her 
special permission to return to cuba 
then in 1965 jacqueline kennedy and mary hemingway agreed their 
late husbands belongings belonged together in a clean 
welllighted place when the jfk library opened in 1979 
hemingways papers were there too 
on wednesday the boat log purchased last year at auction for 
3000 joined about 100000 pages comprising 95 percent of 
hemingways manuscripts mementos such as the black tin trunk the 
writer took on safari in africa and more than 100000 photographs 
of him in action fighting and reporting wars loving women and 
going after fish 
patrick hemingway the second of hemingways three sons came 
from bozeman mont to attend the presentation of the 95 crumbling 
brown pages typed on foolscap and now preserved under clear mylar 
sheets 
a jolly round man with a moon face and the broad warm grin he 
inherited from his father patrick was 6 when his father went 
fishing on the 38foot pilar now 60 the younger hemingway was a 
hunter in africa in the 1960s and worked as a un forester in 
tanzania but at 6 he was the seasick son of a writer 
his father was working on the green hills of africa during 
the fishing trip but his son said it was probably also then that 
his father first collected impressions for the old man and the 
sea which won a nobel prize in 1952 
that sort of thing was in his subconscious from going to 
fish his son said 
the pilar was visited by the writers many friends over the time 
the log records from october 1934 to january 1935 through the 
logs pages traipse such lights as the writer john dos passos and 
editor maxwell perkins 
the log actually is a transcription by arnold samuelson who was 
a 22yearold wouldbe writer who hitchhiked from minnesota to key 
west to spend nearly a year with his idol after samuelsons death 
in 1981 the log went on the market

republicans are planning to challenge house 
action on a savings and loan bailout bill approved by its banking 
committee after democrats changed the wording in a controversial 
provision requiring sampls to subsidize lowincome housing 
committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas said the 
alteration in the 600page bill reported to the full house on 
tuesday two weeks after it was approved by the panel was only a 
technical change to define the clear intent of the committee 
republicans however called it a power grab that was done 
without a vote and promised to fight it when the legislation is 
referred to the house rules committee and on the house floor 
the language in the report differs markedly from the language 
as reported from the committee said assistant house gop whip 
robert walker of pennsylvania substantive sections of the bill 
have been unilaterally changed by the chairman 
the uproar is over a provision authored by gonzalez that the 
banking committees 20 republicans unanimously opposed two weeks 
ago basically it would require sampls to subsidize belowmarket 
mortgage rates for lowincome home buyers by 75 million a year 
from 1990 to 1994 and by 150 million a year in 1995 and thereafter 
according to consumer groups the measure could provide 100000 
lowincome home buyers with mortgages that are 2 percentage points 
below market rates 
if were going to save a savings and loan system that has any 
recognizable right to that name then you have to do something 
about making housing affordable said gonzalez 
republicans had opposed the measure as social engineering 
and said it did not belong in a bill in which taxpayers are being 
asked to pay more than 200 billion over the next 30 years to cover 
bad loans made by sampls in the 1980s 
the dispute was reignited last week when congressional tax 
experts told the taxwriting house ways and means committee that 
the lowincome housing provision looks like a tax setting off 
claims that the banking committee had exceeded its authority 
its a usurpation of this committees jurisdiction by another 
committee charged rep bill archer of texas the ranking 
republican on ways and means 
ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill persuaded his 
committee to defer striking the provision which has widescale 
support among democrats while he and gonzalez attempted to work 
out a compromise the ways and means committee is scheduled to 
formally adopt the change on thursday 
rep barney frank dmass said an accord retaining the 
provision but changing its language in a small way was reached 
through mediation by house speaker jim wrights office and rep 
charles rangel dny chairman of the ways and means subcommittee 
on select revenue measures 
as gonzalez measure was approved by the committee the 12 
district federal home loan banks that borrow funds for and are 
owned by the industry would have to devote 5 percent of their net 
earnings or profits or a minimum of 75 million a year until 
1994 for the new lowincome mortgages 
for 1994 the contribution was 6 percent of net earnings or a 
minimum 90 million and from 1995 on it was 10 percent of net 
earnings or a minimum 150 million a year

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has written 
president bush declaring a halt in shipments of soviet arms to 
nicaragua but weapons are continuing to arrive from cuba and 
eastern european countries the state department said today 
spokesman richard boucher also said the level and pattern of 
arms sales through april is very similar to that of 1988 
he said 27 shipments of military goods were sent to nicaragua 
from the soviet union and its allies through april and that the 
estimated value through march was about 80 million 
boucher said over the four months the arms were supplied by 
eastern europe and cuba with the soviets providing unspecificed 
other military material 
the general secretary indicated in his letter that the soviets 
have stopped sending weapons to nicaragua boucher said 
confirming gorbachev had made the pledge in a letter to bush 
the spokesmans statement echoed reports monday night by the 
washington post and the associated press that gorbachev had 
promised to end direct weapons shipments 
the ap account attributed to unidentified us officials said 
gorbachev had not promised to end delivery of nonlethal equipment 
such as vehicles or said cuba would no longer provide weapons to 
the sandinista government in managua 
the white house had said on tuesday there was no proof that 
gorbachev had made good on his promise to halt weapons shipments to 
nicaragua 
at the moment it appears to be only words not deeds said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater we are very leery 
of their intentions 
despite soviet statements to the united states that weapons 
shipments to nicaraguas leftist government have stopped fitzwater 
said us officials have some evidence the shipments are continuing 
were reluctant to be positive about this because we didnt 
receive the kinds of public commitments or the kinds of visual ones 
that we would like to see he said 
despite his skepticism fitzwater acknowledged the united states 
doesnt know enough about the weapons shipments to say conclusively 
if gorbachev is keeping his promise 
fitzwater said the material could have been in the pipeline when 
gorbachev made his promise or might be coming in from another 
country such as cuba 
im willing to leave the door open on the idea that maybe that 
evidence of continuing military shipments is misleading 
fitzwater said 
the bush administration has been publicly and privately prodding 
gorbachev to discontinue aid to nicaraguas sandinistas whose 
rebel opponents the contras have been supported by the united 
states 
bush has approved a diplomatic rather than military approach 
to peace in nicaragua and has indicated he would respond with 
economic or other incentives for the soviets if moscow halts aid to 
central america 
us officials who insisted on anonymity said that not enough 
was known about the weapons shipments to condemn gorbachev they 
said they were unable to determine what the shipments contained and 
whether the source was the soviet union eastern europe or cuba 
in fact one official said this years shipments appear to be 
going to nicaragua at a slower rate than last year when during 
the first half of the year some 130 million to 150 million worth 
of weapons were recorded going into nicaragua 
referring to gorbachevs high profile armscut proposals in 
recent days and the new promise on nicaragua fitzwater defended 
the bush administration against allegations gorbachev is taking the 
lead in peace initiatives 
fitzwater said the administrations admittedly cautious 
approach is contrasted with gorbachevs one of throwing out in 
a kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion one arms control proposal 
after another 
gorbachevs arms proposals had not all turned out to be the bold

it were humor dodd said

the soviet union does stop supplying military support to nicaragua

a former crewman of the uss stark cast a 
wreath into the water wednesday to mark the second anniversary of 
the iraqi attack that killed 37 americans and altered us policy 
in the persian gulf 
the pentagon meanwhile disclosed that 273 million in 
compensation for the dead has been paid by iraq and distributed to 
their families millions in additional claims for the wounded and 
damage to the ship remain to be settled 
the stark a 3600ton missile frigate was nearly sunk on may 
17 1987 by two frenchmade exocet missiles fired by an iraqi 
warplane while the ship was conducting what us officials called 
routine duty in the central gulf 
the attack killed 37 of its crew of 220 and injured 21 iraq 
later apologized saying the pilot of the f1 mirage had mistaken 
the us frigate for an iranian ship 
the incident spurred the united states to expand its forces in 
the gulf to protect usflagged shipping from the tanker war 
a spinoff of the iraqiran war it also led to a revised policy 
that us commanders should not hesitate to fire first if they 
believed an attack was immiment 
with the waterway quiet since iraq and iran agreed to a 
ceasefire aug 20 the united states has cut its regional force 
from 40 ships to 19 but continues to maintain a presence show 
the flag and monitor usflagged shipping a navy spokesman said 
the 10ship gulf patrol unit would be trimmed further if the 
pentagon approves a plan to remove the last three mine sweepers 
dispatched in 1987 us sources said 
the memorial service was performed aboard the uss curts now on 
duty in the northern gulf according to navy witnesses 
sonar technician 3rd class philip matagavage 22 of hellertown 
pa a stark crewman at the time of the attack tossed the wreath 
over the side on the final note of the navy hymn eternal 
father a 21gun salute echoed across the calm waters and a 
crewman played taps on a trombone 
cmdr david j alexander of new london conn skipper of the 
curts told his sailors who had assembled on deck in dress whites 
that the stark was saved by its crew in a 24hour battle against 
flames fed by missile fuel 
they simply would not let their shipmates fail each other or 
their ship alexander said 
at a local school us ambassador sam h zakhem and rear adm 
william m fogarty commander of the us joint task force middle 
east also praised the stark crews courage and sacrifice 
for a grateful nation tha since birth has paid the price we 
say to the men of stark thank you said fogarty 
the navy also circulated to all ships a suggested prayer on 
behalf of our comrades who have lost their lives in defense of 
freedom in the gulf these past years 
the death toll of 53 since 1987 includes the stark victims 14 
killed in air crashes and two in a carrier deck fire 
iraq has paid 273 million in compensation for the dead aboard 
the stark and the checks were distributed to the families april 28 
according to marine maj robin higgins a pentagon spokeswoman 
baghdad had agreed to the restitution in march after months of 
prodding by the united states it came to about 92 percent of the 
original us demand 
still to be submitted by the united states are separate claims 
for the 21 injured and an 829 million bill for damage to the 
ship the rebuilt stark returned to sea duty last year 
zakhem said mrs barbara kiser a stark widow flew to baghdad 
to donate a 10000 check out of her settlement to an iraqi war 
orphans home 
a pentagon inquiry following the stark incident found that its 
commander had failed to defend his ship adequately in dangerous if 
ambiguous circumstances he and and another officer were allowed 
to resign from the navy rather than face courtmartial 
the revised policy allowing commanders to shoot first if under 
apparent threat was cited by us officials after the cruiser uss 
vincennes mistakenly shot down an iranian jetliner july 3 all 290 
aboard the plane were killed

a nonprofit group based in suburban virginia 
said wednesday it was launching an effort to organize support for a 
washington memorial dedicated to the victims of crime 
many victims and families of victims for years have expressed 
a need for a public place that remembers victims who are killed and 
marks the grief and suffering of survivors and loved ones said 
john wheeler president of the center for the vietnam generation 
based in mclean va 
he added that a beautiful landscaped memorial for victims of 
crime could prove to be a turning point in healing the dreadful 
national situation of violence disrespect drug and alcohol abuse 
and diminished sense of community 
wheeler told a news conference that he would like to see a 
memorial built on privately owned land near pennsylvania avenue 
between the white house and the capitol 
locating the memorial on privately owned property rather than on 
the mall or other public land he said avoids the difficulties 
of having to go to congress and to the several government approval 
agancies 
money for the project expected to cost 10 million to 20 
million would come from philanthropists real estate developers 
and individual donors wheeler said 
he said that over the next six months he was aiming to organize 
a coalition of organizations and individuals to support the 
proposal groups that have already agreed to join the effort 
wheeler said include the washingtonbased national organization 
for victim assistance and the national victim center of fort worth 
texas 
the center for the vietnam generation describes itself as a 
nonprofit group fostering knowledge about the 60 million 
americans who came of age in the vietnam era and advocating 
public service

a court on wednesday convicted 
mohammed ali hamadi of hijacking a twa jetliner and killing a us 
sailor then sentenced him to life in prison for crimes the 
murdered mans parents said deserve death 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger gave the lebanese shiite moslem 
the maximum penalty for the 1985 hijacking and the brutal beating 
and murder of robert stethem 23 of waldorf md west germany has 
no death penalty 
hamadis trial provided a rare look into the planning and 
execution of a major terrorist attack plus chilling witness 
testimony of the terror and brutality aboard the seized aircraft 
during the ordeal 39 americans were held hostage for 17 days 
the parents of the slain navy diver breaking the silence they 
had kept throughout the 10month trial said death would have been 
a more appropriate penalty for the 24yearold terrorist 
our family maintains mohammed ali hamadi deserves punishment 
more severe than allowable under german law richard l stethem 
said 
but the couple said the west german court conducted a fair and 
impartial trial they warned however against the possible 
political commutation of hamadis sentence 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
while we would have preferred extradition to the united states 
we were satisfied and gratified by the outcome 
we expect he will serve his full sentence in accordance with 
german law fitzwater said 
peter korneck one of the prosecutors said hamadi will be 
eligible for a parole review in 15 years hamadis defense lawyers 
said they expected to appeal the sentence 
the stethems attended all of the trials 65 sessions since it 
began july 5 1988 
our purpose for being there was to represent our son i 
thought he deserved that with all his bravery i felt he deserved 
more than that patricia stethem said her voice quaking with 
emotion 
mueckenberger announced the verdict and sentence to a packed 
courtroom inside the fortresslike preungesheim prison in frankfurt 
the judge said the court found hamadi guilty of joint 
participation in murder in the killing of stethem who was shot 
in the head 
during the trial hamadi denied shooting stethem saying the 
bullet was fired by his accomplice hassan ezzeddine who remains a 
fugitive 
hamadi confessed to the hijacking charge shortly after the trial 
began 
twa flight 847 was seized on june 14 1985 after the boeing 727 
took off from athens for rome the plane flew twice to algiers and 
three times to beirut on the hijackers orders 
stethem was shot and thrown onto the runway to die when the 
plane landed the second time in beirut on june 15 1985 
the judge described stethem as tall strong wellbuilt 
selfconfident goodlooking man with a military posture he said 
hamadi took stethem to the front of the plane tied his hands 
blindfolded him and threw him to the floor shortly before the 
sailor was shot 
mueckenberger said the court was unable to decide who actually 
shot stethem 
but the defendant knowingly and willingly participated in 
stethems killing and actively took part in its preparation he 
said 
the judge said hamadi was an active member of hezbollah a 
radical shiite moslem group backed by iran that is believed to hold 
western hostages in lebanon 
mueckenberger said he did not believe a milder sentence would 
have changed hamadis convictions we think he would return to 
live in his homeland and again join hezbollah he identifies with 
hezbollahs aims of terrorism and violence 
during the proceedings hamadi had testified that the goal of 
the hijacking was to force the release of lebanese moslems 
imprisoned in israel shortly after the ordeal ended israel 
released about 700 such prisoners 
hamadi also was convicted of hostagetaking and three counts of 
causing grievous bodily harm in the beatings of stethem and two 
other american passengers clinton suggs and kurt carlson of 
rockford ill suggs is a native of elkhart ind 
he was also found guilty on two counts of smuggling explosives 
into west germany hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 
13 1987 when customs officials found such explosives in his 
luggage

banned playwright vaclav havel a 
symbol of dissent in this communist country was paroled for good 
behavior wednesday midway through an eightmonth jail sentence 
jiri wolf a leader of the charter 77 human rights movement who 
spent six years in prison for subversion also was freed wednesday 
unlike havel wolf was not granted parole and served his full term 
havels arrest during demonstrations in january caused protest 
in the west and among hungarian polish and soviet intellectuals 
it marked the beginning of a crackdown on dissent that conflicted 
with reforms under way elsewhere in the soviet bloc 
hours after being freed havel was speaking out for political 
reform and urging those who campaigned for his release not to 
forget about other political prisoners 
he and his brother ivan said the release was a victory for 
thousands of czechoslovaks who signed petitions protesting havels 
arrest and supporting his request for parole 
at least 20 people have been jailed fined or given suspended 
sentences since the january protests 
havel said czechoslovak leaders have adopted the language of 
reform but have yet to emulate what he described as the 
astonishing change occurring in hungary poland and moscow 
changes of the facade not of the structure have taken 
place in czechoslovakia havel told a czech reporter who shared the 
comments with other journalists 
a step toward genuine change havel said would be the 
retirement of communist party chief milos jakes and other leaders 
who presided over the death of reform after the 1968 soviet 
invasion ended the liberal prague spring 
jakes welcomed president nicolae ceausescu of romania who runs 
the most repressive regime in the soviet bloc for a oneday visit 
wednesday a statement issued after their talks stressed the right 
of each communist party to pursue its own policies 
ivan havel and other dissidents speculated the decision to 
release his brother was intended to deflect western criticism of 
czechoslovakias record at a 35nation human rights conference that 
begins may 30 in paris 
he said he believed domestic support for the playwright put 
pressure on the regime noting that a petition signed by 3000 
people backing the request for parole was not done by dissidents 
but by the broader public 
havel was sentenced feb 22 to nine months on charges of 
incitement and obstructing a police officer an appeals court 
reduced the sentence in march to eight months dropping the 
obstruction charge 
police arrested havel on jan 16 at an unofficial memorial 
ceremony in pragues wenceslas square for jan palach a student who 
burned himself alive in january 1969 to protest the crushing of 
reforms 
on wednesday the playwright said he was reminded of his growing 
status as a national figure by the privileged treatment he received 
in prison 
conditions were much better than during a 4year jail term to 
which he was sentenced in 1979 on subversion charges havel said 
the prison staff expressed so much sympathy with me that i was 
embarrassed because of the bitter thought what about the others 
he said 
havel said he wrote very little in jail because he was not sure 
he could get the material out his works are performed in the west 
and in poland but are banned in czechoslovakia

the house today passed a bipartisan 117 
trillion federal budget for the next fiscal year 
on a 241185 vote the house signed off on the 1990 budget the 
senate planned to give final approval to the package tonight or 
thursday 
critics said the blueprint did not reduce the deficit 
sufficiently but other lawmakers said it was better than a long 
bitter dispute between republicans opposed to higher taxes and 
democrats eager to protect domestic spending 
if we havent achieved legislation perfection we have at 
least avoided legislative gridlock said house minority leader 
robert michel rill 
but progress is expected to be slower on a multibilliondollar 
spending bill for this year which has been mired because of 
disputes over money it contains for antidrug initiatives 
were going to get it up as soon as we can house 
appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten dmiss said 
tuesday after a day of closeddoor talks about the measure 
if congress kept to its schedule on the much less controversial 
1990 budget no serious opposition was expected it would be the 
earliest lawmakers have disposed of the spending plan since 1978 
the legislators speed is attributable to two factors 
one is that overall totals for defense and domestic spending 
and other tough decisions such as the 997 billion deficit it 
contains were decided last month by bush administration officials 
and congressional leaders of both parties 
the other is that the spending plan contains little real pain 
despite its effort to lop 28 billion off the federal deficit many 
lawmakers and other critics have said this is accomplished with 
optimistic economic projections that make the shortfall seem 
smaller and onetime gimmicks such as claiming 18 billion in 
savings by moving the postal service off budget 
science education health housing and law enforcement spending 
would receive healthy increases 
defense spending would rise to 2992 billion 42 billion 
short of the amount needed to keep up with inflation agriculture 
and transportation programs would also be pinched the measure 
calls for 53 billion in new tax receipts but the decision on 
where it would come from will be made later 
on tuesday the bush administration tried to coax congressional 
democrats to finally pass a 1989 spending bill that includes 340 
million for veterans health programs 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski wrote whitten on 
tuesday that without the money workforce reductions and delayed 
purchases of medical equipment would occur the veterans medical 
program he said is in a state of emergency 
the measure was bogged down because of a dispute over 822 
million for antidrug efforts that it also contains the 
administration says the spending can wait until next year and 
threatened to veto the bill unless it was removed 
meanwhile congressional leaders and president bush met at the 
white house tuesday to discuss the fiscal 1991 budget the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law sets a deficit target of 64 
billion for that year and participants agree that meeting the goal 
will be difficult 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the meeting produced some good progress toward 
discussions on sticky subjects such as taxes and spending cuts 
the only specifics that we all discussed there was the fact 
that everything is going to have to be on the table defense 
entitlements taxes all three are going to have to be part of that 
kind of package he said 
there werent any violent reactions said house speaker jim 
wright of texas when reporters asked him how bush had reacted to 
suggestions of new taxes

representatives of the four largest commodity 
futures exchanges told the senate wednesday they were opposed to 
any additional legislation regulating their industry 
we recognize that in recent months some have questioned our 
integrity and expressed doubt about our ability to police our 
markets said karsten mahlmann chairman of the chicago board of 
trade 
but he said that the existence of the exchange depends on our 
integrity he outlined for the senate agriculture committee the 
surveillance procedures the exchange uses to detect trading 
improprieties 
mahlmanns opinion was shared by leo melamed chairman of the 
chicago mercentile exchange z lou guttman chairman of the new 
york mercantile exchange and robert fink first vice president of 
the commodity exchange inc 
they also explained how they monitor traders to protect against 
misdeeds and the penalities imposed when wrongdoers are discovered 
sen robert kerrey dneb however challenged their diligence 
saying he thought violations in student loans and among farm 
borrowers were being pursued more vigorously than in commodity 
futures trading 
he cited justice department figures showing that 12 million in 
fines for trading violations had not been collected 
i think the message going out to crooks and swindlers is the 
odds are in your favor said kerrey 
he said he wanted figures from the industry executives on the 
exact amounts collected in fines which all four said they would 
supply later 
their appearances were part of congress inquiry into 
commodities trading before reauthorizing the commodity futures 
trading commission the federal agency charged with overseeing such 
markets 
after it was revealed earlier this year that the fbi had been 
conducting an undercover investigation of alleged fraud on the 
chicago exchanges congress has been considering strengthening the 
powers of the cftc 
at a previous hearing before the agriculture committee the 
general accounting office questioned the intensity of exchange and 
cftc efforts to detect and punish trading abuses 
at another earlier session the cftc issued reports that were 
critical of some of the exchanges internal enforcement programs 
in gathering information about the futures industry the 
committee has expressed concern about statistics showing that the 
board of trade has levied significantly fewer sanctions against 
violators than the other exchanges in relation to their size 
mahlmann said the figures the committee had received from the 
cftc were wrong he said that the board of trade had levied 145 
million in fines in 1988 not the 287000 shown by the cftc 
when leahy asked him how the discrepancy could exist mahlmann 
said the lower figure resulted from a very narrow 
interpretation of what a violation was

after surviving years of harassment by 
authorities polands top underground publishers exhibited hundreds 
of uncensored books for the first time wednesday at an official 
international book fair 
times have really changed said jan kofman an editor of the 
poltical quarterly krytyka as he answered questions from people 
who crowded around the display 
next year we are going to have our books shown right in the 
center of the show said grzegorz boguta the head of nowa the 
independent publishing house the countrys premier clandestine 
publisher 
nowa and other independent publishing houses such as krag cdn 
and przedswit were tucked away at the end of a corridor off the 
main hall of the cavernous palace of culture a skyscraper built by 
the soviet union for poland that dominates downtown warsaw 
the main question people ask is where they can buy the 
books kofman said at one point rudi jankovic director of 
quadra enterprises ltd a private british book distributor walked 
up and offered to buy and market nowas entire underground display 
this is real publishing aggressive and creative jankovic 
said 
boguta said the exhibits represent the first step to operating 
as a normal publishing house but that there is still a long way to 
go 
there is now a very optimistic political situation for 
underground publishing houses we want to be official because we 
want to publish more better quality books than today but 
uncensored he said 
toleration of underground publishers known in poland as the 
second circulation has been growing in the last year 
especially after the start of formal talks between the opposition 
and authorities in february 
among nowas more than 400 titles published in the last 12 years 
are books by such authors as nobel prize winners alexander 
solzhenitsyn and andrei sakharov philosophers hannah arendt and 
jeanpaul sartre and american writers kurt vonnegut jr and philip 
roth 
nowa was also one of the main outlets for polish opposition 
activists such as essayist adam michnik political theorist jacek 
kuron and labor leader zbigniew bujak 
but why should underground publishers surface at all 
we couldnt stay hidden we can publish only a few thousands 
copies of books in very poor technical conditions now censorship 
is very liberal boguta said now we have a chance to be 
official but we must be quite independent 
boguta who also heads the group association for free speech 
would like to create a nationwide network of independent book clubs 
and start a company with foreign investors to publish uncensored 
books 
on a lower level of the palace of culture the emigre press also 
was allowed for the first time to exhibit polishlanguage books 
printed abroad including works long banned 
a crowd peered at editions published by the parisbased kultura 
that has published many of polands finest authors and preserved 
them from oblivion 
not all authors must rely on the independent press to get books 
published 
the official czytelnik publisher announced a polish edition of 
mercy and gallows a social history on charity from the middle 
ages to the present by bronislaw geremek a historian and adviser 
to solidarity leader lech walesa 
czytelnik also has published the painted bird by jerzy 
kosinski an emigrant to the united states long vilified in his 
homeland but recently restored to official good graces 
the catholic publishing house znak took orders for its books 
that include the polish version of walesas autobiography a way 
of hope 
more than 20 countries are represented at the fair all of the 
east bloc countries except romania have displays and there are 
publishers from west germany france great britain italy and the 
united states

school officials are hoping a visit 
thursday by president bush will help boost confidence in an 
innovative new setup that offers teachers big pay raises for more 
work and more responsibility 
critics of the plan adopted two years ago say it has not paid 
off in better education 
we sure could use the presidents power of persuasion that 
theres no alternative but to improve public education said adam 
urbanski president of the teachers union 
urbanski helped formulate a threeyear teacher contract to boost 
salaries and make teachers more accountable for what goes on in the 
classroom education reformers pointed to the program adopted by 
the district as a model for the nation 
bush is expected to visit wilson magnet high school an 
innercity showcase for the changes going on in the district he 
also is scheduled to give a speech about education at an eastman 
kodak co plant in the suburb of gates 
the visit comes as officials feel increasing pressure to show 
that education has improved since teachers were given the chance to 
earn 60000 to 70000 a year in exchange for more work and 
responsibility for the curriculum and spending 
we understand that the public wants to see some kind of 
result said benjamin douglas school board president i hope 
they realize that president bushs visit is recognition that were 
further down the road of reform than most places 
last week school officials asked the city to increase school 
taxes 102 percent to help continue the program and critics became 
more outspoken 
over a twoyear period theyve asked for almost a 20 percent 
increase said gordon johnson executive director of the 
rochesterbased citizens tax league any time any unit of 
government keeps galloping along at 10 percent while inflation is 
running at 2 and 3 percent its too much 
advocates of the setup like william johnson president of the 
citys urban league also are starting to express concerns im 
still optimistic but i think we should be able to see some 
instant shortterm improvement that can be measured he said

president bush is losing a global public 
relations war against soviet president mikhail s gorbachev by 
making lackluster arms control proposals and offering no vision 
of a better world the house armed services committee chairman 
charged wednesday 
rep les aspin dwis in a hearing before his panel also 
chastised the white house for making belittling statements about 
the soviet leader instead of moving to counter his plethora of arms 
control proposals with imaginative responses 
not only is this administration not very good on substance 
theyre not very good on pr public relations aspin said 
aspin charged that the administration has chosen a cautious and 
reactive stand pat approach to gorbachev rather than 
attempting to challenge the soviet leader with ambitious proposals 
aspin particularly complained the administrations proposals to cut 
conventional forces in europe were unambitious 
its not just a pr problem its a substantive problem if 
we want to score weve got to come up with some creative 
seizetheopportunity initiatives aspin said you guys need a 
proposal and frankly open skies doesnt make it 
last week bush called for a revival of the 1950s open skies 
proposal by president eisenhower that would have allowed the 
soviets and united states to fly unarmed inspection aircraft over 
the others territory the 30yearold proposal was never 
implemented 
other house democrats told paul wolfowitz undersecretary of 
defense for policy and reginald bartholomew undersecretary of 
state for security assistance that the administration has not done 
enough to battle gorbachevs initiatives particularly in light of 
the heated argument within the nato alliance over modernizing the 
pacts shortrange nuclear weapons 
the issue is expected to prove devisive at bushs first nato 
summit later this month 
the united states and britain want to move forward with the 
modernization of the lance missile force but west germany and 
several smaller nations oppose it the west germans have also 
called for ussoviet negotiations on reducing or eliminating the 
weapons but the united states objects contending the weapons are 
needed to deter any attack from the larger soviet bloc ground and 
tank forces 
wolfowitz and bartholomew argued that many of gorbachevs 
initiatives such as his most recent offering to get rid of 500 
shortrange nuclear weapons were designed to glean publicity and 
were not actually substantial when viewed against the overwhelming 
superiority in warsaw pact forces 
and they argued gorbachev is actually getting mileage by 
moving closer to positions the united states has long advocated 
its not a pure picture of progress wolfowitz said 
instead of new thinking were still seeing a lot of old 
thinking he added noting that the soviets still retain the 
largest armed force structure in the world 
we have to keep our eyes on the warts as well as the more 
positive steps that have been taken bartholomew said 
wolfowitz and bartholomew said that the administration was being 
cautious in areas where they deemed it was necessary and had put 
forward a serious and farreaching proposals to trim the 
conventional forces in europe which the soviets are now just 
coming around to meet 
but aspin argued that even though the administrations position 
might find agreement among diplomats and the military it wasnt 
winning in the political arena 
you cant beat something with nothing in politics he said 
theres no vision there you have to give me a better world i 
can point to youve got to have some vision out there and it 
just aint there 
aspin also criticized statements made tuesday by white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater who said the administration of 
leery of gorbachevs promise to halt military aid to nicaragua 
fitzwater also accused gorbachev of throwing out arms control 
proposals like a drugstore cowboy in the effort to win 
attention 
i dont think you ought to run down the gorbachev proposals i 
dont think the kind of statements marlin fitzwater is making are 
helpful aspin said

the bush administration on wednesday opposed 
broadening a new tax provision designed to encourage saving for a 
college education 
a parent may avoid federal income tax on a series ee savings 
bond issued after this year that is redeemed to pay 
highereducation expenses for the parent a spouse or dependent 
the same benefit will be available to a student 24 or older 
the tax benefit is phased down once a couples income reaches 
60000 and ends at 90000 
sen j james exon dneb has introduced a bill that would 
extend the benefit to bonds used for highereducation expenses of 
any person not just the owners immediate family thus a 
grandparent could use a taxexempt bond to pay tuition for a 
grandchild 
we are concerned that the purposes of the phaseout could be 
easily circumvented under the bill dana l trier tax 
legislative counsel for the treasury department told the senate 
finance committee 
he said for example that a wealthy person could give taxfree 
money to a parent with a low income the parent would buy bonds 
with the money and the proceeds later would be used to finance the 
education of a grandchild 
trier estimated exons proposal would cost the government about 
300 million over five years

the us trade deficit bolstered by record 
export sales shrank dramatically to 886 billion in march the 
government said wednesday in a report that prompted some economists 
to question their earlier assessment that the countrys trade 
improvement had stalled out 
the commerce department said the march deficit was down 98 
percent from the february imbalance of 982 billion a figure that 
was itself lowered from an initial report a month ago which had 
put the february deficit at 105 billion 
the march improvement came from a 74 percent rise in exports 
which hit a record 3078 billion imports rose 3 percent to 3964 
billion pushed upward by rising oil prices 
analysts who had been looking for little or no improvement in 
the march figure noted that sales of american manufactured goods 
and farm products were up sharply helping to lower the deficit 
with all major us trading partners 
the deficit with canada the countrys largest trading partner 
declined to 248 million its lowest in almost eight years the 
united states ran a rare trade surplus of 397 million with western 
europe the best showing in six years 
the trade report was hailed as good news by the bush 
administration which is counting on continued strength in american 
exports to propel domestic growth this year 
these numbers support our contention that a favorable movement 
in our exports and imports is underway said commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher he noted that the average overall monthly deficit 
from january through march was 10 percent lower than the average 
from october through decmeber 
prviate economists have been worried that the dollars strength 
over the last year could jeopardize further trade improvements by 
making american goods more expensive overseas 
after reviewing the march figures however some analysts said 
they were revising their trade projections for 1989 based on a 
belief that strong economic growth overseas was fueling demand for 
american products and would offset the adverse effects from the 
dollars increase 
us trade is off the sticky track and has moved to a 
permanently improved position said allen sinai chief economist 
of the boston co healthy economies overseas contributed to an 
explosion of exports in march 
last year the trade deficit shrank by 32 billion to 11976 
billion down from an alltime high of 15212 billion in 1987 
sinai said he was looking for the 1989 improvement to be around 
16 billion putting the deficit at 103 billion for the first 
three months of this year the deficit was running at an annual 
rate of 1094 billion 
the performance in the first quarter suggests that demand 
abroad is vigorous and american firms are competitive enough to 
take advantage of it said robert dederick chief economist of 
northern trust co in chicago 
but some economists remained unconvinced that the trade deficit 
would show much improvement this year based on a belief that 
rising oil prices and continued strong demand for imports would 
offset any further gains in export sales 
there is not a chance that this trend toward lower trade 
deficits will continue said michael evans head of a washington 
forecasting firm i expect to see 10 billion to 11 billion 
monthly trade deficits for the rest of the year 
the bush administration has a lot riding on the countrys trade 
performance because it needs robust economic growth to bring in 
enough revenues to lower the federal budget deficit without raising 
taxes last years trade improvement was responsible for almost 
half of total growth in the economy 
the march trade improvement came despite the fact that the bill 
for foreign oil climbed to 369 billion the highest total in 16 
months the increase resulted from the fourth consecutive monthly 
increase in the average price per barrel which rose to 1597 the 
average price had been 1242 in november 
us exports posted acrosstheboard increases in most 
categories sales of manufactured capital goods climbed to 1005 
billion up 84 percent from february while sales of agricultural 
products shot up 207 percent to 336 billion 
as usual the biggest deficit was recorded with japan a 42 
billion imbalance down from a 47 billion gap in february other 
large deficits were recorded with taiwan 790 million south 
korea 427 million and brazil 341 million 
us trade representative carla hills must decide by the end of 
this month which countries the administration will target for 
possible retaliation unless they agree to lower barriers keeping 
american goods out japan south korea and taiwan are the leading 
candidates for inclusion on that list

soviet tv viewers were treated wednesday to 
pictures of their president strolling along the great wall of china 
and joking with young people about chinese cooking 
mikhail s gorbachevs visit to china dominated the staterun 
media taking up all 45 minutes of the evening tv news program 
vremya and most of the first two pages of the government 
newspaper izvestia 
the coverage continued reports by the official media about the 
trip that were unusally lengthy and detailed 
staterun tv showed gorbachevs speech to chinese intellectuals 
before its evening news program and his news conference in beijing 
after the news was over giving viewers several hours of virtually 
uninterrupted coverage of gorbachevs visit 
many of the images of gorbachev at the great wall showed him 
talking to young people students are at the heart of a protests 
that coincide with gorbachevs visit that have turned into the 
largest display of defiance of authorities in 40 years of communist 
power 
official soviet tv did not show pictures of demonstrators on 
beijings tiananmen square as it did on monday night 
in the tv report gorbachev said repeatedly he was impressed by 
the desire of chinese youth for better relations with the soviet 
union 
the soviet leader has been careful in his public statements not 
to get into the middle of the dispute between studentled 
protesters and the chinese government that has forced several 
changes in his schedule 
this has been preserved not only among the old but the young 
as well this is very important gorbachev told a soviet tv 
interview this is my strongest impression 
at one point talking with chinese young people at the great 
wall gorbachev reached out to hug a young woman at another point 
talking about chinese food he said it is said chinese cooking 
is some of the best in the world now i can confirm that 
gorbachev said he hoped chinese students would once again come 
to moscow to study as they had done before the rift between the 
communist giants that he is trying to mend with his visit 
izvestia said gorbachevs meeting with senior chinese leader 
deng xiaoping was an historic occasion 
from this day a new stage of sovietchinese relations is 
beginning izvestias evening edition said in its lead article 
there was practically full agreement in this historic 
conversation in relation to new political thinking and new 
international political order izvestia said 
asked by the tv interviewer if he thought the soviet union and 
china would begin to compete instead of cooperate in economic 
relations gorbachev said he saw great promise for cooperation with 
china in energy transportation light industry and other economic 
spheres 
the news broadcast also carried gorbachevs interview with 
chinese tv and reports on the activities of his wife raisa and 
of foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze

prime minister yitzhak shamir won parliaments 
approval for his peace plan wednesday overcoming a challenge from 
lawmakers in his rightwing likud bloc who said it could help 
create a palestinian state 
the vote in parliament after more than seven hours of sometimes 
bitter debate was 43 in favor and 15 against with 11 abstaining 
but 51 legislators were absent including some likud members who 
walked out before the vote of confidence was called 
likud dissidents included industry minister ariel sharon and 
economy minister yitzhak modai who has called on shamir to resign 
in the occupied territories two palestinians were killed 
wednesday and at least 14 were wounded arab hospital officials 
said 
ala jibril 15 died of a gunshot wound to the head in askar 
refugee camp on the west bank the arab report said 
the army said omar abu jaber 41 died of a bullet in the chest 
in nearby jenin but it added that no troops were operating there 
israel radio said an israeli civilian may have shot jaber an army 
spokesman confirmed five wounded and said it was checking the other 
casualty reports 
wednesdays deaths brought the toll to 481 palestinians killed 
since arabs began revolting 17 months ago against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip twentyone israelis 
also have been killed in the uprising which shamir is trying to 
end with a plan calling for palestinians to elect representatives 
to negotiate a limited autonomy 
gazas 700000 residents were confined to their homes for a 
third day as israeli police continued a sweep of israeli markets 
and factories forcing home all gazan arabs 
the loss of wages could cause severe hardships for 50000 gaza 
residents who work in israel and have few job opportunities at 
home some israeli industries that depend on arab labor already 
have sought permission to import workers from abroad 
shmuel goren coordinator for the occupied lands told a 
parliamentary committee wednesday that gazans will not be allowed 
to return to israel without special permits army radio reported 
he said the permits also would be issued to 60000 west bankers 
employed in israel 
goren said some 28000 gazans with criminal records would not 
get permits the radio said it was unclear if this included 
palestinians jailed without charge for antiisraeli activities such 
as organizing protests 
in presenting his peace proposal shamir played down its 
rejection by leading palestinians who charge it is a ploy to cheat 
them out of a palestinian state 
the plan rules out participation by the palestine liberation 
organization which is outlawed in israel but which many 
palestinians consider their rightful representative 
from the arab side there have been voices of refusal and 
rejection shamir said we do not think these voices are the 
final word 
among opposing legislators was geula cohen of the extremeright 
tehiya party who warned of a backlash in israel 
if you fail to see the writing on the wall then there will be 
an uprising that will force you mr prime minister to bring an 
entirely new proposal she said this uprising will be without 
stones but it will also be without gloves 
at a likud meeting before the vote opponents argued the plan 
paves the way for the creation of a palestinian state 
the initiative states that we shall negotiate with any arab 
who is elected said legislator pessah grupper this is leading 
toward negotiations with the plo 
shamir assured them that palestinians involved in plo activity 
will not be able to run in elections or vote

in a sign of the changing mood in europe a 
top polish official said wednesday his government would not object 
to the reunification of germany as long as polands borders were 
guaranteed 
we feel that european security systems can change whereas the 
basis for security arangements being based on respect for integrity 
is unchangeable said jozef czyrek the no 2 official in the 
polish communist party 
czyrek also said in an interview with the asociated press that 
two soviet regiments were being withdrawn from poland and that he 
envisions a day when all of moscows troops leave 
he also expressed hope that president bush scheduled to visit 
poland this july would issue a reciprocal invitation to gen 
wojciech jaruzelski who declared martial law in 1981 but is now 
guiding his nation toward democratic elections in june czyrek met 
with bush at the white house monday 
jaruzelski is expected to remain polands president after the 
elections and czyrek has been mentioned widely as jaruzelskis 
successor as first secretary of the polish united workers or 
communist party 
the changes in the soviet union and tentative steps that poland 
and hungary have taken toward democracy have prompted speculation 
that the sovietled warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty 
alliance could play a diminished security role in europe and that 
east and west germany divided during the cold war might 
ultimately reunite 
the german invasion of poland 50 years ago triggered world war 
ii since the war poland has expressed reservations about the 
reunification of east and west germany 
czyrek by contrast expressed cautious acceptance of eventual 
german reunification 
all the processes which would include that security poland 
would support at this point in time poland has good relations 
with the gdr german democratic republic or east germany and tries 
to improve its relations with western germany said czyrek 
at this point in time european security is based on 
territorial integrity a respect for territorial integrity and the 
shape of europe as a result of the second world war and 
developments after the second world war he said 
a polish government aide later said that czyreks formulation 
marked a change in the official stance 
our position used to be in nondiplomatic terms that we 
liked germany so much that we wanted to see two of them said the 
polish government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states views possible reunification as an issue to be 
decided by the german people although us officials say they 
worry what would happen if west germany left nato 
asked whether poland would view a unified germany as a threat 
czyrek said 
a nation that does not take its historical experience into 
consideration puts itself in danger that applies to poland also 
we do not forget our experiences obviously it has an influence in 
shaping our attitude towards germany we are not closing our eyes 
to the future 
czyrek also said that within the last few days polish and 
soviet officials had agreed that two regiments of soviet troops 
would be withdrawn from poland 
the soviet union maintains 40000 soldiers in poland according 
to the institute for international and strategic studies in london 
most of those are logistical support troops for the estimated 
380000 soviet soldiers in east germany said czyrek but he was 
unable to say precisely how many soviet troops were being pulled 
out 
czyrek asked whether he foresaw the day that all soviet troops 
would go home replied 
surely i do is that so difficult to imagine 
david isby an expert on the soviet military said the average 
soviet tank regiment has 95 to 100 tanks and 1575 people

facsimile machines are proliferating and with them come 
unsolicited fax ads and messages but already one state has banned 
junk fax after the governors machine was clogged with 
messages protesting fax legislation 
a second governor annoyed by a fax blast urging rejection of a 
fax regulation bill is considering signing the law several other 
states are weighing similar measures 
one bill sponsor maryland state delegate gilbert j genn said 
opposition comes from directmail and electronic marketing firms 
which frequently are armed with fax telephone number lists and 
automatic dialing machines 
you can almost imagine the havoc that this could wreak genn 
said 
a spokesman for the group that sparked the blizzard of fax 
messages to the two governors said wednesday he never expected so 
many responses 
fax machines which can send a page of text or illustration over 
telephone lines in about a minute are used for everything from 
sending documents between lawyers and zapping news releases to the 
media to getting in a speedy order to the sandwich shop 
before lucille balls death last month the machine at 
cedarssinai medical center churned out getwell messages virtually 
nonstop said hospital spokesman ron wise i am completely 
convinced the fax machine is destined to become the hallmark card 
of the 90s wise said 
but uninvited advertising can tie up the receiving machine and 
use up its expensive special paper 
on tuesday five days after his machine was deluged with 
messages urging him to veto a bill banning unsolicited fax 
messages an annoyed connecticut gov william a oneill signed the 
measure into law 
i had been following discussion about the legislation 
oneill said but frankly last week was the first time the need 
for this kind of legislation was brought home to me 
the messages oneill received came from businesses that had 
received fax fliers from the national fax users committee of 
mission viejo calif 
maryland gov william donald schaefer received 343 fax messages 
last week after the group faxed fliers to maryland businesses to 
relay to him he wont decide to sign or veto until tuesday 
if we had any important messages coming in we wouldnt have 
been able to get them through said david s iannucci the 
governors lobbyist 
connecticuts new law allows people receiving unsolicited fax 
messages to seek up to 200 in damages marylands bill would 
impose fines up to 1000 
the national fax users committee is just a very loose group of 
fax users elliott segal said wednesday he described himself as 
kind of a point man i guess for the group 
segal vice president of marketing for an irvine calif 
company that sells fax paper and advertises by faxing messages to 
500000 machine users said the deluge that oneill received was 
a very unfortunate situation 
how would we have anticipated that this many responses would 
have been generated he said 
donna murdoch executive director of the american fascimile 
association in philadelphia said the group doesnt think 
advertising by fax works anyway unless youre selling fax 
paper her group estimates there are 3 million fax machines in 
this country 
segals group isnt alone in getting state officials attention 
new york state consumer protection chief richard kessel said he 
was about to send an important memo to gov mario cuomo when his 
machine spit out a threepage menu from a sandwich shop now new 
york legislators are considering banning junk fax 
the last thing you want when youre trying to meet a deadline 
or trying to get a memo in to your boss is to be disturbed by 
someone trying to sell draperies or submarine sandwiches kessel 
said 
ohio state rep otto beatty last month introduced a bill to ban 
fax ads he said he was irritated when an ad for mens clothing 
appeared on his law office machine interrupting an exchange of 
documents during a business negotiation 
washington state rep ken jacobsen who introduced a bill 
against junk fax said of the issue this is the ultimate in 
abusive use of a private communication system you get a message 
you didnt want from people you dont know on paper they didnt 
buy

frances first constitution goes on the auction block next month 
along with other documents from the bloody events of 200 years ago 
the 57page manuscript to be sold june 12 by paris auctioneer 
jacques tajan contains countless annotations in maximilien 
robespierres own hand on various aspects of the first constitution 
prepared in 1791 by the national assembly 
bound in fine red moroccan leather its value is estimated at 
66000 
the sale also features documents from the king luois xvis trial

despite all the nasty things that people continue to do to me 
i am well the queen wrote to mecyargenteau her close friend 
and confident 
the letter is estimated at about 10000 
known as the incorruptible robespierre was responsible for 
sending some 17000 people to the guillotine during the yearlong 
reign of terror which climaxed with his own beheading in 1794 
the notes show he was obsessed with power he believed in a 
strong central authority and was against the creation of a 
legislative branch composed of representatives elected by the 
people for brief periods of time 
his notes also condemn the national assemblys plan to limit the 
vote to those paying taxes worth three days work 
wealth corrupts more than poverty robespierre wrote in the 
margin of the text millionaires are the ones who should be 
excluded from voting

world tensions eased somewhat last 
year but more developing nations acquired ballistic missiles 
which can carry nuclear warheads disarmament researchers said 
wednesday 
the stockholm international peace research institute said truces 
ended five wars in 1988 cutting the number of active conflicts 
from 33 to 28 
there was a clear break in the constant increase in major 
conflicts to which the world had grown accustomed during the 
1980s said the institutes 1988 yearbook 
but the report said an alarming 24 developing nations obtained 
or were trying to obtain ballistic missiles many of them have 
refused to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
ceasefires halted the iraniraq war the conflict between 
ethiopia and somalia the war between chad and libya and battles 
within angola and namibia it said tensions eased in seven other 
conflicts although fighting grew fiercer in many other regional or 
civil wars said the 530page report 
the institute an independent group funded mainly by the swedish 
parliament tracks developments in weapons trading and arms 
control its yearbook has become a standard reference on these 
issues 
institute director walter stuetzle blamed the united states 
for failing to respond to disarmament challenges offered by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and urged the administration to hasten 
negotiations 
stuetzle said the spread of ballistic missiles capable of 
carrying nuclear or chemical warheads was alarming 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a larger problem than 
ever before said stuetzle a former west german undersecretary 
of defense this is nothing to be proud of 19 years after the 
nonproliferation treaty 
seventeen nations have deployed ballistic missiles and about 
500 may have been fired last year in the iraniraq war the report 
said 
stuetzle said israel has the most advanced ballistic missile 
force outside of the five major nuclear powers including a 1760 
pound artillery rocket that is the largest anywhere 
argentina brazil india north korea and taiwan also make their 
own missiles the report said saudi arabia last year bought 
chinesemade css2 systems which are the most powerful missiles 
found in the third world the report said 
but worldwide defense spending declined last year among the 16 
nato members the total defense budget dropped by 3 percent last 
year 
finance ministers are winning over the defense ministers 
the report said 
and the united states is paying less for europes defense than 
it claims the report said estimating that about 15 percent of 
us defense spending was directly related to north atlantic treaty 
organization or about 09 percent of gross domestic product 
the report also said the international trade in conventional 
weapons dropped slightly to 34 billion 
the soviet union and the united states were the largest 
suppliers responsible for 66 percent of the world market india 
was the largest buyer followed by iraq north korea saudi arabia 
and afghanistan the report said

an undiplomatic wrangle over three of president 
bushs diplomatic nominees broke out in the senate foreign 
relations committee on wednesday 
when it ended the prospects were that two appointees would face 
lengthy delays and perhaps prolonged senate debate 
and one had received the verbal equivalent of having his mouth 
washed out with soap 
the three nominations that caused the problems richard r burt 
to be the new us strategic arms negotiator donald gregg to be 
ambassador to south korea and reter v secchia to be ambassador 
to italy 
the situation 
sen jesse helms rnc accuses burt of leaking classified 
information to a female journalist with whom burt says he once had 
a social relationship helms vows to delay action on the senate 
floor pending a state department investigation sen joseph r 
biden ddel defended burt saying he broke no law the 
committee eventually endorsed the nomination 142 
sen alan cranston dcalif says he is prepared for lengthy 
and investigative hearings into greggs alleged involvement in the 
irancontra affair unless president bush withdraws the nomination 
of the man who was his vice presidential national security adviser 
chairman claiborne pell dri says he fears that secchia a 
former michigan republican national committeeman will be an 
embarrassment to the administration and the united states as 
ambassador to italy because of a penchant for making gross 
remarks in public 
but pell who said italian friends were aghast at the 
choice said he would not block action the committee sent the 
nomination to the senate 110 
cranston who opposes gregg and supports burt and sen jesse 
helms rnc who opposes burt and supports gregg accused each 
other in effect of holdings each others candidate hostage 
helms said cranston has launched a fishing expedition to 
uncover adverse information against gregg a 30year veteran of the 
cia 
you swore him in as if he was some sort of culprit which he 
is not helms complained you hope to be able to milk the 
irancontra cow again 
cranston said his concerns revolve around the nominees 
credibility and judgment and whether or not he had misled the 
congress by denying any knowlege of the covert resupply of 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
i have no intention of dragging out this matter at any great 
length but i think we do not yet have full information cranston 
replied 
as far as im concerned you didnt catch a thing helms 
asserted 
cranston then spelled out a series of events that began with 
greggs introduction of former intelligence operative felix 
rodriguez in december 1984 to oliver l north then a member of the 
staff of the national security council cranston said the eveznts 
and documentary evidence strongly indicate that gregg may well 
known that rodriguez had been deeply involved in the illegal 
resupply of the contras 
the possibility also is posed cranston said that gregg 
deliberately misled the congressional irancontra investigating 
committee when asked about his alleged involvement in the affair as 
well as the foreign relations panel 
sen mitch mcconnell rky defended gregg and declared don 
gregg did not want to slink off into the shadows and hide he 
wanted to be named to a position subject to confirmation so he 
could put this thing to rest if either he or the president had 
anything to hide the president would never have sent this 
nomination up here 
helms then counterattacked 
if you hold this up ive also got a nominee about which 
information has come in helms said hes the darling of your 
side of the aisle richard burt 
helms served notice he would delay the burt nomination on the 
senate floor and appeared to link its fate to that of the gregg 
nomination 
he repeated allegations that burt had abused his security 
clearance in various state department positions and had published 
classified information in his previous career as journalist 
he said burts alleged actions violated federal law which is 
what this is a crime he said 
biden disagreed saying burt had broken no law 
pell pressed for a committee vote but that was delayed

four senators proposed wednesday to ban use of 
the chemical alar on apples and other agricultural products and 
said they expected fast floor action on their measure 
the train is under way sen john warner rva told a news 
conference called to unveil an alar ban he said would benefit 
producers as well as consumers he indicated he would move to 
bypass committee action and attach the bill as an amendment to 
legislation ripe for quick floor action 
the bill would reduce to zero the amount of the growthenhancing 
chemical that could be used on apples and other crops primarily 
grapes cherries and peanuts the ban would be effective as soon as 
signed by the president 
alar which enhances the appearance of apples and keeps them 
fresh longer has also been identified as a cancercausing agent in 
laboratory animals 
despite initial assessments from the environmental protection 
agency that alar does not constitute a health risk for consumers 
apples sales have plunged since disclosures that the chemical 
manufactured by uniroyal is widely used 
apple producers are facing a 100 million loss on the raw 
crop this year as a result of unfavorable reports about alar and 
there has been an additional 30 percent drop in apple juice sales 
according to derl i derr president of the international apple 
institute based in mclean va 
derr said his group composed of 23 state organizations 
representing an estimated 90 percent of the nations 15000 
commercial growers favors taking alar off the market but not by 
legislative means he said reducing the allowable amount to zero 
would require an epa finding that alar poses an imminent hazard 
and if you think we have a bad market now you should see what 
it would be like then derr said he said his organization is 
urging growers to stop using the compound and hoping uniroyal will 
voluntarily halt sales 
on monday derr said that by september of this year the 
already low levels of alar will be reduced to virtually zero 
simply the us apple industry is not going to use alar 
the environmental protection agency estimated in march that alar 
was being used on just 10 percent of the nations apple supply and 
it was starting a procedure that could lead to a ban on the 
chemical in 18 months 
the senate bill would affect only food crops and would allow 
continued use of alar on commercially produced flowers 
none of the measures sponsors is a member of the senate 
agriculture committee which for years has proven an obstacle to 
tough farm chemical regulations recommended by environmentalists 
and consumer advocates 
similar legislation was quietly introduced in the house earlier 
this year although no action has been taken on it 
senators at the news conference said there was no time to lose 
in clamping down on the chemical 
if we do not ban alar from the market american consumers in 
increasing numbers will ban apples from their diet declared 
sen joe lieberman dconn 
sen harry reid dnev called the measure a major step in 
the right direction but no one should fool themselves into 
thinking that this action eliminates the danger of pesticides for 
american consumers 
there are 50000 other pesticides out there he said 
if our children are at risk said sen donald w riegle jr 
dmich it is our responsibility to alleviate the risk right 
now

prospects for summer water supplies in much of 
the west declined last month because of belowaverage precipitation 
and early snow melt the agriculture department said wednesday 
warm temperatures and sunny skies throughout the west in april 
caused snowpack to melt sooner than usual for the month said 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation service 
april precipitation was below average or wellbelow average 
throughout the region except in the pacific northwest and montana 
he said consequently seasonal forecasts have been reduced in most 
basin areas 
early runoff improved reservoir storage dramatically 
scaling said however inflows have already begun to taper off in 
many basins 
april precipitation was less than 50 percent of average in the 
southwest except for pockets of aboveaverage precipitation in 
southern arizona southeastern new mexico and central colorado 
streamflow forecasts have been reduced throughout the west 
through september scaling said however nearaverage flows are 
expected for most rivers in oregon as well as for the upper 
columbia the upper snake and along the mainstem of the yellowstone 
river 
nevada is the only state where reservoir storage is wellbelow 
average he said summer inflows to reservoirs are likely to be 
belowaverage in all western states 
the west depends on snow melt for about 75 percent of its water 
supply

tens of thousands of protesters 
chanting down with the dictatorship wednesday demanded the 
overthrow of president roh taewoo and protested the violent 
suppression of a may 18 1980 uprising 
punish roh taewoo was the cry from about 50000 students 
workers and townspeople who marched through kwangju a city 168 
miles south of seoul 
thousands of students led the procession waving red blue and 
yellow streamers and placards and accusing police of torturing a 
student to death earlier this month 
down with roh taewoo who committed murder and torture 
screamed protesters who also demanded yankees go home they 
accused the united states of patronizing the roh regime 
also wednesday the official yonhap news agency reported 
thousands of students staged peaceful campus protests in seven 
other cities over the death of radical student lee cholkyu 
thousands of people have protested daily in kwangju since lees 
body was found may 10 in a reservoir near the city police had 
sought the student for antigovernment acts 
government officials say lee appears to have fallen into the 
reservoir after fleeing from police who stopped him at a checkpoint 
speakers at a wednesday rally in kwangju called for a continued 
campaign to end military rule in south korea 
lets punish roh and expel the yankees forever by inheriting 
the will of the patriot lee cholkyu one dissident leader said 
the crowd responded with slogans demanding an independent 
investigation into lees death 
police stayed away from the rally in an apparent move to avoid 
clashes but a spokesman said 7000 riot policemen were on standby 
the police are on a nationwide alert to block possible protests 
marking the ninth anniversary of the nineday civil uprising in 
kwangju in which at least 192 people were killed 
dissidents say roh a former general is a front for military 
rule and accuse him of helping his disgraced predecessor chun 
doohwan to suppress the prodemocracy revolt 
government officials say they deployed troops as a last resort 
to end an armed rebellion 
the dissidents claim chun and other army officers provoked the 
uprising to seize power they also say the united states condoned 
chuns actions a charge washington denies 
chun went into rural exile last november after making a public 
apology for misdeeds under his sevenyear authoritarian rule 
opposition parties want chun to testify before the national 
assembly 
south korea has experienced a wave of violent antigovernment 
and antiamerican protests and labor strikes in recent months 
roh ordered a crackdown on dissidents after six riot policemen 
died in a may 3 campus clash 
dissidents and radical students have been calling for rohs 
overthrow but they lack support because of their violent tactics 
and extremist views 
they also do not have the support of most south koreans in their 
demands for the withdrawal of about 43000 us troops stationed in 
their country under a mutual defense pact

prosecutors on wednesday interrogated two 
politicians suspected of taking bribes in an influencepeddling 
scandal that has shaken public trust in japanese politics 
they were the first elected officials questioned in the recruit 
scandal in which 14 bureaucrats and businessmen were arrested on 
charges of bribery or securities law violations 
prosecutors said takao fujinami chief cabinet secretary under 
former former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and katsuya ikeda 
a legislator from the opposition komeito party each were 
questioned for about 12 hours 
the two are suspected of accepting bribes in return for helping 
the recruit co in its employment information business 
under japanese legal custom summonses for interrogation are 
regarded as an equivalent to arrest 
ikeda 51 said tuesday that he would resign his parliament 
seat ruling party officials denied reports that fujinami 56 
would resign but indicated he might have to do so if he is 
formally charged 
also on wednesday komeito chairman junya yano became the third 
party leader to step down in the scandal he follows prime minister 
noboru takeshita who is resigning as head of the ruling liberal 
democratic party and thus as prime minister and saburo 
tsukamoto who stepped down in february as head of the opposition 
democratic socialist party 
ruling party leaders still are trying to find a new prime 
minister who is untainted by the scandal 
people hope that the prosecutors will go to the center of 
nakasone administration said tsuruo yamaguchi secretarygeneral 
of the japan socialist party 
news reports tuesday said nakasone would be willing to testify 
in parliament concerning his links to recruit his refusal to 
testify in past months contributed to an opposition boycott of 
parliamentary business 
aides to nakasone were among some 160 politicians bureaucrats 
and businessmen who bought bargainpriced unlisted shares in a 
recruit subsidiary and made large profits when the price soared 
after public trading began 
of 17 politicians linked to purchases of recruit shares 11 were 
members of the cabinet of nakasone who was prime minister at the 
time of the share transactions 
a share transaction handled by fujinamis secretary brought 
profits of about 191000 prosecutors said ikedas brother 
yuzuru earned about 73530 on recruit share transactions and 
news reports say 70 percent of that went into ikedas own bank 
account 
ikeda repeatedly raised questions in parliament that prosecutors 
say were helpful to recruit 
komeito leaders held an emergency meeting and chairman yano 
later told reporters that he believed ikedas statement that he was 
innocent of wrongdoing but the komeito chairman said public trust 
in the party had been impaired and said he had resigned 
yano himself is under fire for links to an earlier scandal 
involving transactions

drug policy coordinator william j bennett 
told sports commissioners and player representatives wednesday they 
should set a single tough drug policy for the pro athletes who set 
examples for americas youth 
participants said the giveandtake with bennett was useful but 
most said adoption of a uniform drug policy for major professional 
sports was unlikely 
its farfetched to believe that we can all agree on such a 
policy said gene upshaw head of the national football league 
players association 
while bennett expressed a strong desire that the commissioners 
toughen their stand on drug use in sports he stopped short of 
pressing the leagues to randomly test athletes for drugs 
surprisingly he was not in there mandating that we have 
random testing upshaw said that was music to my ears 
all that may change however when the group convenes again this 
summer 
we didnt talk about random testing today but we might talk 
about that next time bennett said well get into specifics at 
the next meeting 
no policies were put in place wednesday but bennett expressed 
hope that concrete ideas might come out of the followup meeting 
most important we have agreed to meet again this summer in a 
month or two so we can have some specific suggestions for the 
national strategy which i am writing bennett said 
among those at the meeting were commissioners pete rozelle of 
the national football league david stern of the national 
basketball association and a bartlett giamatti of major league 
baseball 
steve ryan senior vice president for marketing and public 
relations for the national hockey league was also present 
bennett the top federal official in the fight against illegal 
drugs said he spent much of the 90minute meeting exchanging ideas 
with sports officials on ways to improve antidrug standards in 
general as well as for pro sports while he listened to their 
advice he also made suggestions 
i told them that professional sports has to be part of the 
solution bennett said the question i put to the group is 
while we are pressing very hard on schools and others to have 
tough policies it seems only right that professional sports have 
those kind of standards 
bennett said he was interested in getting the opinions of 
highranking sports officials because most athletes are considered 
role models by children 
pro sports play an important part in american life bennett 
said if they are so important and they do have such a hold on 
the american imagination then this ought to be the focal point of 
our effort 
giamatti said pro sports has in place programs which if not 
perfect are real comprehensive and i think he found 
interesting 
donald fehr executive director of the major league baseball 
players association said hopefully we were able to begin to 
acquaint the secretary with the kinds of problems weve had and the 
successes and the failures we went through in trying to solve 
them

the state department said wednesday that the 
pattern of delivery of soviet bloc weapons shipments to 
nicaragua had not changed even after soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs agreement to stop sending soviet arms to the sandinista 
government 
whats more department spokesman richard boucher said the 
soviets themselves continue to send other military equipment to 
nicaragua 
responding to persistent us appeals for a cutoff in support 
to the sandinistas who are battling americanbacked contra 
insurgents gorbachev wrote bush earlier this month that he had 
suspended soviet weapons shipments on jan 1 and would not resume 
them 
but us officials told the associated press monday that the 
soviet leader had declined to end other military support such as 
vehicles and would not impede cuban deliveries of weapons to 
nicaragua 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on tuesday dismissed 
gorbachev as a drugstore cowboy suggesting there was more show 
than substance in his letter to bush 
other us officials passed the word to reporters that 17 
shipments of military goods had reached nicaragua but declined to 
say whether they came from the soviet union its eastern european 
allies or cuba and whether or not weapons were included 
then on wednesday the state department confirmed gorbachevs 
letter although insisting that the pattern of soviet bloc aid to 
nicaragua had not changed by the departments own account 
however the soviets themselves had stopped sending weapons as 
gorbachev had told bush was the case 
boucher said that 27 shipments of military goods were sent to 
nicaragua from the soviet union and its allies in the first four 
months of the year and that the estimated value of shipments 
through march was about 80 million 
boucher said that over the fourmonth period arms were supplued 
by eastern european countries and cuba with the soviets providing 
unspecificed other military materiel 
the general secretary indicated in his letter that the soviets 
have stopped sending weapons to nicaragua boucher said thereby 
confirming gorbachevs pledge as reported monday night by the 
washington post and the associated press 
the spokesman added in sum the level and pattern of delivery 
so far is very siumilar to that of 1988 that is military 
supplies delivered by the soviets and weapons and lethal equipment 
delivered by their cubans and east european clients 
in past years though the united states said the soviets were 
providing both weapons and other military equipment to nicaragua 
the aid totaled an estimated 515 million last year 
meanwhile on capitol hill the chairman of the house armed 
services committee chastised the white house for its statements 
about gorbachev and accused administration officials of lacking 
vision in meeting the soviet leaders arms control challenges 
rep les aspin dwis alluded to statements by fitzwater 
besides calling gorbachev a drugstore cowboy the spokesman 
said the administration was leery of the soviet leaders 
promise to halt military aid to nicaragua 
i dont think you ought to run down the gorbachev proposals i 
dont think the kind of statements marlin fitzwater is making are 
helpful aspin told two administration officials at a hearing by 
his committee 
the administration contends that many of gorbachevs 
initiatives such as his recent offering to withdraw 500 
shortrange nuclear weapons from eastern europe have been designed 
to glean publicity and were not actually substantial when viewed 
against the overwhelming superiority of warsaw pact forces in 
europe 
but aspin argued that the administration was being outflanked by 
the soviet leaders ability to win the public relations war 
particularly among us allies in western europe 
aspin and several other democrats complained to paul wolfowitz 
undersecretary of defense for policy and reginald bartholomew 
undersecretary of state for security assistance that the 
administration was losing that fight because it has not responded 
swiftly enough to gorbachevs various arms control proposals nor 
with enough imagination 
wolfowitz and bartholomew countered that the administration was 
being cautious in areas where such restraint was deemed as 
necessary and had put forward serious and farreaching proposals 
to trim the conventional forces in europe which the soviets are 
now just coming around to meet

oscarwinning composer marvin hamlisch 
serenaded a group of democratic senators wednesday after their 
republican counterparts were pulled away by a white house summons 
hamlisch was performing at a reception hosted by sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio to celebrate the musicians upcoming marriage 
when the gop contingent was called away to discuss minimum wage 
legislation 
im so sorry the president had to blow my little party by 
taking all the republicans said metzenbaum 
so while the esteemed senators from the gop did business at 1600 
pennsylvania ave metzenbaums democratic pals enjoyed a bit of 
broadway in a government office building 
hamlisch and metzenbaum are longtime friends and the musicians 
fiancee terre blair hails from columbus ohio 
that was reason enough for metzenbaum and his wife shirley to 
have tables linens asparagus salad and upright piano moved into 
the democrats capitol hill office for a small celebration with 
selected senators and spouses 
hamlisch played theyre playing my song and metzenbaums 
favorite hamlisch composition the way we were for which the 
composer earned one of his three academy awards 
hamlisch then asked the senators to call out any phrase so that 
he could form a song around the lyric uncharacteristically they 
fell silent 
the future bride ms blair 33 said she met hamlisch on a 
blind telephone date set up by her los angeles housekeeper and the 
housekeepers new york sister 
ms blair said she almost didnt return the call when hamlisch 
left his number on her answering machine but did so at the urging 
of a friend 
ms blair and hamlisch hit it off over the telephone and fell in

two firefighters reportedly resigned amid an 
investigation into charges they and nine others pretended to be 
hispanic to get preferential hiring treatment 
fire department spokesman bill murphy and other city officials 
would not confirm the report wednesday in the boston globe 
city councilman bruce bolling who called for an investigation 
of minority hiring last year said he could not obtain confirmation 
either but that it appeared the probe by the state personnel 
department was ending successfully 
hopefully this chapter in the boston fire department and city 
could never be replicated again in terms of someone misrepresenting 
themselves and getting away with it bolling said 
the investigation began with the case of two fairskinned 
brothers who said they were black and went unchallenged for 10 
years the 33yearold twins paul and philip malone were 
suspended without pay in august after officials determined they had 
misrepresented their race 
the malones have refused to discuss the case on the advice of 
their attorneys but told officials that their maternal 
greatgrandmother was black a court hearing on their suspension 
has been scheduled for next wednesday 
the fire department had forwarded the names of 11 firefighters 
who identified themselves as hispanic to the state officials have 
said the 11 were hired between 1976 and 1983 before a screening 
process was established in 1984 
if they can substantiate that they in fact are minorities then 
thats fine but to the extent that they cant and theyve clearly 
misrepresented themselves theyve taken an employment opportunity 
away from a legitimate minority bolling said 
in 1974 a federal court established a preference system for 
hiring minorities after finding that fire department hiring had 
been based on a discriminatory examination 
at the time only 19 of more than 2100 city firefighters were 
black or hispanic today the department is 21 percent black and 
hispanic compared with 20 percent for the citys population 
the globe reported that firefighter richard l pardo resigned 
march 31 and thomas france quit monday pardo hung up when called 
by the associated press on wednesday there was no listing for 
france in the boston telephone directory

the justice department has deported the first 
nicaraguan refugees from south texas since it began detaining 
central american asylumseekers in february officials said 
wednesday 
department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said the 
deportations do not signal a change in policy and were delayed 
because there were some bottlenecks 
although dozens of salvadorans guatemalans and hondurans have 
been deported since the immigration and naturalization service 
began detaining central american asylumseekers on feb 20 no 
nicaraguans had been deported until monday 
ins spokesman duke austin said 10 nicaraguans were deported 
monday and 16 on tuesday with deportation orders pending on more 
than 100 others 
in july 1987 thenattorney general edwin meese iii issued a 
memorandum encouraging the ins to look favorably on asylum cases 
filed by nicaraguans that memo required the justice departments 
asylum policy review unit to examine all requests for refugee 
status from nicaraguans austin said 
the ins recently received approval from the justice department 
to remove some nicaraguans austin said ms burstionwade said 
deputy attorney general harold christensen has final word on 
nicaraguan deportations 
in the six months after the meese memo the nicaraguan asylum 
approval rate rose to 83 percent compared with 30 percent before 
the directive according to ins figures released by rep john 
bryant dtexas 
on wednesday religious leaders who toured the rio grande valley 
earlier this week condemned the ins practice of detaining refugees 
and disputed agency claims that the flow reaching texas has dropped 
under its gettough approach 
despite the expenditure of a large sum of money millions of 
dollars by the immigration and naturalization service during the 
past 60 days we saw no convincing evidence that the policy of 
increased enforcement detention and rapid deportation has resulted 
in any significant decrease in the flow of central american 
refugees across the border the groups statement said 
the group from the interfaith committee for central american 
refugee protection said the ins policy has succeded only in 
removing the refugees and the problem from public view while 
creating serious obstacles to the filing of legitimate claims 
austin said the group cannot back up claims the flow of aliens 
has not fallen adding we can support with empirical data that 
the flow has dramatically decreased austin said 
austin said the number of refugees filing for asylum has fallen 
to about 70 or 80 a week down from about 1700 to 2400 a week 
earlier this year

the palestine liberation organization 
accused west german relief workers wednesday of concealing the 
identity of their kidnappers and asked them to vacate their base in 
a refugee camp within 10 days 
the plo announcement came one day after police reported that 
three workers in the private relief organization asmehumanitas 
were abducted in sidon by gunmen 
one of the captives nurse petra schnitzler was freed after a 
few hours when a local militia intercepted the kidnap vehicle in 
the belief they were stopping escaping thieves 
police had no word on the whereabouts of heinrich struebig 48 
an administrator and thomas kemptner 28 a nurse 
all i can say about this case is that it stinks said a 
police spokesman 
it was the third time ms schnitzler and struebig had been 
reported abducted since last year the two said they had been freed 
from overnight captivity 13 days ago to transmit the demands of the 
kidnappers holding a third colleague markus quint quint was freed 
sunday 
palestinian security officials in south lebanon quoted ms 
schnitzler and struebig as saying the kidnappers were demanding a 
mild sentence for confessed twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi a 
lebanese shiite moslem 
a west german court sentenced hamadi on wednesday to a life 
sentence for air piracy murder and related charges in the june 
1985 hijacking of a twa passenger jet during which us navy diver 
robert stethem was killed 
a statement issued by the plo at its tunis headquarters and 
transmitted to the mieh mieh palestinian refugee camp said the 
relief workers were covering up the identity of their abductors 
please kindly move out of our area for we are not 
responsible for your security conditions from now on the 
handwritten englishlanguage statement said 
they were given 10 days to pack and leave a local official said 
asked to comment on the accusations that she helped conceal the 
kidnappers identity ms schnitzler said sarcastically thats a 
nice sentence i would be happy if it were true 
she said the group will not take any decision without contacting 
their organization 
west german foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said the 
government had asked the group 15 times to pull out of lebanon 
besides the two west germans 15 foreigners are missing in 
lebanon most are believed held by shiite abductors loyal to iran

the parents of us navy diver 
robert stethem said wednesday they want the united states to make 
sure the man who murdered their son on a hijacked airliner never 
gets out of prison 
mohammed ali hamadi deserved a death sentence richard and 
patricia stethem said but the maximum sentence in west germany is 
life imprisonment 
he was given a life sentence wednesday for murder air piracy 
and other charges connected with the june 1985 hijacking of a twa 
jetliner during which 23yearold robert stethem was beaten shot 
and thrown from the aircraft 
the courtroom in frankfurts preungesheim prison compound was 
packed to hear the verdict and sentencing 
hamadi 24 was standing next to his translator and appeared to 
slump slightly and bowed his head momentarily when chief judge 
heiner mueckenberger pronounced the maximum sentence 
soon afterward mr and mrs stethem met with reporters and read 
a statement that said our family maintains that mohammed ali 
hamadi deserves punishment more severe than allowable under german 
law 
when asked what he meant by a more severe punishment stethem 
replied the death sentence i believe that if he had been tried 
in the united states that very possibly he would have been given 
the death sentence 
in their first public comment since the trial began july 5 
1988 the stethems expressed concern about speculation that hamadi 
might be freed someday for political reasons 
we mention this because the thought of such a release is 
painful for us to think of stethem said any commutation of 
hamadis sentence would be a pure mockery of justice 
last week frankfurt lawyer rainer hamm said the stethems and 
the 17 other american coprosecutors feared kidnappings and other 
types of blackmail might lead west germany to release hamadi 
early hamm represented the americans 
stethem said wednesday reading from the statement we would 
hope any release would result in a public outcry by german and 
american citizens alike and would cause people to express outrage 
against this type of political injustice 
we would expect our present administration state department 
department of justice and congress to monitor the fulfillment of 
this sentence and to ensure it is completely served 
prosecutors said hamadi would be eligible for a parole review in 
15 years the stethems attended the trial from the beginning 
it was very hard to sit there and hear this but it was better 
to be sitting here and hearing it than sitting in the states and 
not knowing what was going on richard stethem said we had to 
be here to hear it 
mrs stethem said her voice shaking our purpose for being 
there was to represent our son i thought he deserved that with 
all his bravery i felt he deserved more than that 
passengers on twa flight 847 testified that robert stethem was 
beaten repeatedly before he was shot 
during the proceedings the stethems sometimes appeared to stare 
for long periods directly at hamadi across the courtroom from 
them on wednesday they acknowledged making eye contact with the 
lebanese shiite moslem 
we could look at him and we stared at him a lot but he wasnt 
one to look back at us richard stethem said we could catch 
him a very few times looking at us 
his wife said when we did make eye contact he immediately 
dropped his eyes in a guilty sort of way and i felt a lot of guilt 
on his part in that way 
asked what she felt in those moments she replied without 
hesitation like i could go over and punch him out 
i think that we felt that we probably would like to harm 
him her husband added

leaders of congress and south african 
antiapartheid activists urged the bush administration on wednesday 
to impose additional economic sanctions against south africa to 
force the white government to grant the black majority political 
rights 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said generally 
speaking we have not found sanctions productive and have viewed 
additional sanctions as being counterproductive 
fitzwater also confirmed reports that fw de klerk the leader 
of south africas national party who is expected to become 
president later this year would visit the united states he will 
meet with secretary of state james baker but not with bush 
fitzwater said de klerk would be the first major south african 
official to visit here in about 30 years 
also administration officials said veteran diplomat william 
swing is expected to be named ambassador to south africa swing 
54 has previously served as ambassador to the congo and liberia 
the white house said bush had managed to surmount scheduling 
problems and would meet with the south african antiapartheid 
delegation early thursday 
the group had asked for the meeting one month ago but until 
wednesday afternoon the white house said it was having trouble 
finding time nobel prize laureate archbishop desmond tutu warned 
that a nonmeeting would be a very significant signal against 
the antiapartheid movement senators edward kennedy and paul simon 
both urged bush wednesday to meet with the group 
tutu said he had met with baker recently and felt the new us 
administration was less doctrinaire in its approach toward 
south africa than the previous one 
tutu met with former president reagan in 1984 but he later 
called him a racist pure and simple over the former presidents 
decision to veto an economic sanctions bill passed by congress in 
1986 congress overrode the veto but the reagan administration 
implemented the sanctions reluctantly and incompletely 
tutu along with the reverends allan boesak and beyers naude 
came to the united states to launch a campaign for reviving the 
stalled attempts to legislate additional punitive trade sanctions 
on south africa they attended a forum with some 80 lawmakers 
governors academics and businessmen in the ornate senate caucus 
room to discuss their plans 
simon conceded the new sanctions bill would face a tough fight 
in the senate where republicans have threatened to block the 
measure with a fillibuster but pledged to push on with his 
efforts he called bushs agreement to meet with the group an 
encouraging sign 
sen john warner of virginia one of several republicans who 
attended the forum urged bush to make a show of good faith 
publicly in committing his administration to a campaign to end 
apartheid 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he was 
encouraged by the openness of the bush administration as signaled 
by the presence of assistant secretary of state herman cohen at the 
gathering mitchell said congress and the administration agree 
upon the end abolition of apartheid we must now reach agreement 
on the means 
kennedy saying the fight against apartheid has become the 
greatest human rights struggle of our time urged the bush 
administration to work together with congress on a new strategy 
toward south africa 
the south african group argued that without sanctions their 
government would not have any incentive to negotiate with the 
countrys 28 million blacks who make up 85 percent of the 
population they contended that it was the countrys economic 
straits including inflation unemployment and a heavy foreign 
debt that caused the government to agree last year to grant 
independence to namibia and end its occupation of the territory 
specifically the group suggested targeting the coal oil and 
diamond mining industries for punitive measures as a way of 
tightening the screws on south africa it also urged the united 
states to lead an international sanctions campaign against south 
africa

democratic house members joined by some 
republicans vowed wednesday to write into law senatepassed 
restrictions on president bushs plan to coproduce the fsx jet 
fighter with japan 
the lawmakers said they will ask the house foreign affairs 
committee on thursday to endorse senate legislation sponsored by 
sen robert c byrd dwva directing the white house to forbid 
the transfer of sophisticated jet engine technology to japan and to 
guarantee the united states gets at least 40 percent of the 
benefits of the deal 
the white house said it has grave concerns that the byrd 
amendment could erode presidential authority the state department 
said the provision could force renegotiation of the agreement with 
the japanese government 
the house prepared to begin work on the fsx plan following the 
senates narrow 5247 defeat of a bid to reject the arrangement 
entirely 
although the senate kept the plan alive it also voted 7227 
tuesday to adopt the byrd amendments restrictions 
in the house rep richard gephardt dmo who campaigned for 
the democratic presidential nomination last year on a platform of 
protecting us industry against japanese imports said it is 
essential that congress adopt the amendment because we dont want 
some vague promise that doesnt get fulfilled 
it is important to hold the administrations feet to the 
fire said rep mel levine dcalif were saying that when you 
negotiate a deal demonstrate that we are really going to get the 
40 percent you were talking about 
the senate passed the byrd amendment by a virtually vetoproof 
margin and levine said there is a good chance the house can follow 
suit 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif said the amendment was a 
classic example of meddling micromanagement by congress he 
described it as a sourgrape amendment by those who lost the vote 
against fsx in the senate 
but rep helen delich bentley rmd predicted that a number of 
republicans would join the houses democratic majority in 
supporting the restrictions proposed by byrd 
one reason they will do so she said is that mitsubishi heavy 
industries the japanese company slated to build the fsx also 
built part of a complex in libya the united state says is capable 
of producing poison gas in large quantities 
you are going to find a lot of republicans who are against 
this mrs bentley said 
gephardt was asked if byrds proposal is a killer amendment 
that would prove fatal to the fsx codevelopment and coproduction 
plan 
if it is it ought to be killed gephardt said 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
told house republicans his administration would work against the 
byrd amendment when the measure gets to a housesenate conference 
committee to resolve variances between the two houses versions 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois said bush had 
asked republicans to stick with him on the fsx even though they 
face pressure back home 
fitzwater said bush was concerned by the byrd amendment because 
it creates a system of congressional approval over these kinds of 
projects that we consider to be erosive of presidential power 
even before tuesdays vote deputy secretary of state lawrence 
s eagleburger made it known that the administration regarded the 
new directives as unneccessary and likely to trigger new and 
lengthy negotiations 
byrd told the senate on tuesday the restrictions were essential 
because it would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting 
our aircraft industry and the vital technologies associated with 
it

the cypriot government and religious 
authorities are angrily disputing an indiana art dealers claim to 
four byzantine mosaic pieces claiming the antique holy images were 
stolen 
the removal of the mosaics was an act of plunder and 
pillage said thomas kline a washington attorney who represents 
cyprus and the autocephalous greekorthodox church cypriot 
officials were in washington on wednesday plotting strategy for the 
legal battle over the mosaics 
arguments over the 6th century tile mosaics depicting the christ 
child the apostles matthew and james and an angel will be heard 
may 30 before a federal judge in indianapolis 
the mosaics come from the panayia kanakaria byzantine church in 
the village of lythrangomi in turkishoccupied northern cyprus 
cypriot officials say the mosaics were probably removed in 1979 
five years after the turks invaded cyprus 
the dealer peg l goldberg bought the mosaics in switzerland 
for 12 million and is trying to sell them to the j paul getty 
museum in malibu calif for 20 million 
this is going to be interesting case said constance 
lowenthal executive director of the international foundation for 
art research a new yorkbased group dedicated to combating forgery 
and theft of artworks 
the dispute already known to the art world has reached the 
upper levels of the administration william von raab the head of 
the customs service was briefed on the case as were officials 
from the state department 
both the government of cyprus and golberg have hired highpriced 
attorneys and lobbyists to defend them goldberg has enlisted help 
from two former aides to sen richard lugar rind 
goldberg 50 a hamilton county ind commissioner and a 
private art dealer followed all the proper procedures when she 
bought the mosaics indirectly through a turkish art dealer 
according to louis gerig her public relations consultant in 
indianapolis 
i feel confident she has done all the right things said 
gerig a former aide to lugar and assistant press secretary to 
former president reagan gerig was also a special assistant to the 
commissioner of the customs service 
after goldberg bought the mosaics and brought them to the united 
states in july gerig and jeffrey bergner another exlugar aide 
checked with state department officials to ensure there were no 
problems associated with the treasures gerig said 
gerig said he was assured there were none goldberg however 
never checked with the cyprus embassy to find out the status of the 
mosaics embassy officials said 
then goldberg through her agent offered the mosaics to the 
getty museum after that marion true the museums curator of 
antiquities contacted authorities in cyprus who said the 
antiquities had been stolen according to a deposition in the case 
although customs agents had allowed the mosaics to come into the 
country the service opened an investigation into the case early 
this year said gerig who said he went to see von raab about the 
issue 
last february von raab signed a letter saying it appeared the 
antiquities were brought into the united states properly 
the chief counsel here could not find criminal intent she 
in good faith declared the items said dennis schimkoski von 
raabs spokesman 
in march attorneys for cyprus sought a restraining order to 
prevent goldberg from selling the mosaics 
with the trial slated for later this month a delegation from 
cyprus arrived here to consult with attorneys seeking to prove in 
court the antiquities were stolen from the island said marios 
evriviades a spokesman for the embassy 
although the united states and cyprus have a treaty covering 
stolen artworks the pact was not ratified until 1983 it does not 
apply to items removed before that time said ann guthriehingston 
director of the cultural properties advisory board of the us 
information agency

cocaine was readily available nationwide at 
recordlow prices last year while hospitals reported emergencyroom 
visits by users jumped nearly a third a government study said 
wednesday 
users paid between 50 and 120 per gram of cocaine while 
wholesale prices ranged between 11000 and 34000 per kilogram 
according to the 11th annual survey of illicit drugs by the 
national narcotics intelligence consumers committee 
wholesale prices have declined for the fourth straight year from 
1985 when a kilogram cost betweeen 30000 and 50000 said the 
study 
last year a kilogram of cocaine cost between 12000 and 
40000 according to the study based on law enforcement reports 
retail prices ranged between 80 and 120 a gram in 1986 and 1987 
the study also found that purity of cocaine available to users 
had increased from about 50 percent to 70 percent last year 
according to laboratory tests performed by the drug enforcement 
administration 
the availability of purer and cheaper cocaine was accompanied by 
a projected 30 percent increase in the number of hospital 
emergencyroom visits due to cocaine use last year the report said 
based on data from the first nine months of 1988 the study 
projects there were 42491 hospital emergencies from cocaine use 
last year compared to 32578 recorded in 1987 
there were 19090 emergencies reported in 1986 and 10397 in 
1985 the study said 
peru remained the worlds largest source of coca and unprocessed 
cocaine last year while colombian nationals continued to be the 
predominant ethnic group involved in cocaine processing 
importation and distribution the report said 
the report also noted that cocaine processing at illegal 
laboratories in this country continued to decrease last year it 
concluded that drug traffickers had transferred their operations to 
latin america in the wake of steppedup us enforcement efforts 
the number of cocaine laboratories seized by police and federal 
agents dropped from 17 in the 1987 fiscal year to nine during the 
1988 fiscal year the report said 
the report also found that crack was available in most major 
metropolitan areas only a few major cities notably chicago and 
st louis did not report serious trafficking in crack 
increased crack use was reported last year in washington 
boston philadelphia atlanta new orleans denver and phoenix 
the study was written by the interagency committee that is 
composed of representatives from 11 agencies including the fbi 
the coast guard the drug enforcement administration the cia the

a halfdozen congressmen sat rapt wednesday as 
murray feshbach reeled out statistics about the soviet union 
showing among other things that the number of central asians among 
soviet military recruits was growing far faster than predicted 
feshbach a pioneer in soviet demography is in seventh heaven 
with the greater openness under president mikhail s gorbachev 
we used to complain that we did not have enough information 
now we complain that we have too much said feshbach interviewed 
amid the mountains of soviet documents at his georgetown university 
office as he prepared for his congressional testimony 
on wednesday he told members of the congressional commission on 
security and cooperation in europe that under gorbachev the soviets 
were beginning to allocate more resources to the sorely neglected 
fields of housing and health care 
the need is severe said feshbach for example 40 percent of 
soviet medical school graduates cannot read a cardiograph 800000 
to 900000 soviets suffer every year from hepatitis compared to 
about 56000 in the united states and 1100 to 1500 soviet 
annually come down with diphtheria a disease that has virtually 
disappeared in the united states 
such data are more easily available under gorbachev said 
feshbach but still there is a lot missing and the quality of a 
lot of the information is up for grabs 
feshbach has been poring over soviet statistics since 1955 and 
his years of diligence have made him something of a legend in 
academia and government agencies that deal with moscow two years 
ago he worked in brussels as the first sovietologistinresidence 
for the secretarygeneral of the north atlantic treaty organization 
he experienced one of the high points in his career in late 
january when he was allowed to accompany a moscow censustaker an 
experience that he says taught him that the soviets are very 
likely to publish the figures in a more truthful fashion than 
after the last census in 1979 the results of that census dribbled 
out with major gaps 
preliminary results from the 1989 census already have been 
published and have joined the stacks of documents piled in 
feshbachs office much of the news is bad for the kremlin 
the population of the moslem republics of central asia where 
there is little industry and lots of underemployment continued to 
grow at a much faster pace than in the slavic republics where 
workers are needed russia grew by 7 percent compared to 28 
percent for turkmenistan 22 percent for kirghizia 29 percent for 
uzbekistan and 34 percent for tadzhikistan 
other soviet publications have reported that the percentage of 
soviet conscripts who come from the moslem republics of central 
asia and caucasia has risen from 28 percent in 1980 to 37 percent 
in 1988 he said 
that was my projection for the year 2000 feshbach told the 
congressional panel he had been predicting for years that the 
exploding population of central asia would pose problems 
particularly in the soviet military 
recent soviet articles have confirmed that the central asian 
conscripts have trouble mastering the russian language and the 
complicated machinery of modern war 
ninety percent of rural central asians do not speak russian 
feshbach told the congressional panel that could lead to a 
volunteer army within five years or so 
feshbach discussing the latest wave of soviet statistics with a 
reporter sorted through census data to figure how many people died 
in the armenian earthquake last december 
he calculated that population of armenia had been growing by 
about 50000 per year added that to the 1988 figure subtracted 
the 1989 figure and concluded that there are approximately 
250000 fewer people in armenia than there would have been with 
no earthquake 
the official soviet death toll 25000

all people should be free to leave their homeland 
speakers said wednesday at an officially recognized conference on 
emigration rights held in the country most often publicly accused 
of violating them 
the right to leave is at the core of international 
humanitarian law said law professor irwin cotler of canadas 
mcgill university it is tantamount to the right to liberty and 
even i would say to the right to life 
speakers said the soviet record on emigration has improved under 
president mikhail s gorbachev but the improvements have not been 
guaranteed by law a new more liberal law on emigration is 
expected to emerge in the coming weeks 
foreign ministry official vladimir morozov said 108000 citizens 
emigrated from the soviet union in 1988 20 times as many as in 
1986 he admitted that emigration officials had often abused their 
positions but said the forthcoming law would make them more 
accountable 
the conference titled freedom of movement for all was 
sponsored by the international foundation for the survival and 
development of humanity soviet human rights activist andrei 
sakharov presides over the foundations human rights committee but 
could not attend 
the foundation was formed in moscow in january 1988 to direct 
studies on such threats to mankind as the arms race pollution and 
hunger it has offices in moscow stockholm and washington its 
soviet members include officials and unofficial figures 
in the first quarter of 1989 the soviet union granted 57000 
exit permits mainly to ethnic germans armenians pentecostalists 
and jews last month 4557 jews left the highest figure for any 
single month since jewish emigration peaked in october 1979 
president bush said last week he would ask congress to ease the 
jacksonvanik amendment which links trade concessions for 
communist countries to emigration performance provided moscow 
fulfills its promises on new laws and their enforcement 
among soviets attending the conference however many said they 
were still denied exit from the country largely because of their 
purported knowledge of state secrets elya varshavskaya 75 said 
she was not allowed to join her only son in denmark because she 
worked for the secret police more than 40 years ago 
soviet officials have said the new law on emigration will ease 
secrecy restrictions and probably repeal the requirement that a 
prospective emigrant have an invitation from a close relative 
in a summary of one report to be presented at the conference 
professor vladimir kartashkin recommends that passports for foreign 
travel be made available to any citizen who wants one and that a 
maximum of five years be set for the validity of state secrets 
kartashkin of the national academy of sciences institute of 
state and law also said soviets should not be deprived of 
citizenship if they leave to live abroad 
among soviet emigres stripped of their citizenship were ballet 
dancers mikhail baryshnikov and rudolf nureyev and cellist mstislav 
rostropovich they were denied entry to the soviet union until it 
recently began to welcome them back for visits ordinary emigrants 
also routinely lose their citizenship 
conference organizers distributed an appeal asking all 
governments that limit freedom of movement to bring their laws into 
line with international human rights agreements and encourage 
travel and emigration

diplomater comment 
the uskorean talk took place during the historic 
fencemending visit to beijing of president mikhail gorbachev of 
the soviet union the country regarded as a main supporter of north 
korea 
north korea has consistently demanded withdrawal of the more 
than 40000member us military force in south korea as a 
precondition to normalizing relations and unifying north and south 
korea 
the united states describes its military presence as a deterrent 
to north korean aggression or renewal of fighting in the korean 
war although that war was waged from 1950 to 1953 it never 
officially ended and technically has remained in a state of 
armistice

two environmental groups said wednesday they 
have urged agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to go slow in 
deciding whether to open up millions of acres of longterm 
conservation land to haying and grazing in droughtstricken areas 
pressure has been generated on capitol hill and from some state 
governors for the agriculture department to approve haying or 
grazing or both on highly erodible land taken from crop 
production under the conservation reserve program 
but kenneth a cook vice president for policy at the center for 
resource economics and justin r ward senior project associate of 
the natural resources defense council said it is premature to open 
up the conservation lands as a source of livestock feed 
in the 1988 drought the usda approved haying on millions of 
acres of crp land in dozens of states but none has been approved 
for haying or grazing in 1989 
cook and ward said in a letter to yeutter that several major 
farming areas face the possibility of a second straight year of 
severe drought 
it is early in the growing season and the threat will not 
materialize if moisturedeficient areas in iowa kansas nebraska 
and other states receive the amount of rainfall the national 
weather service has recently forecast the letter said 
it is understandable cook and ward said that many farmers 
particularly livestock producers are extremely anxious at this 
time 
but we urge you to proceed with deliberation and caution in 
any decision to open the crp they said the public has already 
invested billions of dollars in the crp and will invest billions 
more in the years ahead 
such investment yeutter was told could be compromised if usda 
does not establish clear consistent criteria and procedures 
for deciding on the emergency use of crp lands 
more than 28 million acres have been set aside under the crp and 
is supposed to remain out of production for 10 years the contracts 
specify that protective grass and trees must be planted to project 
the fragile soil from wind and water erosion 
in return farmers get initial financial help from usda to plant 
the grass and trees each year they get federal rental payments 
averaging around 50 per acre annually these currently cost about 
15 billion a year

a house subcommittee moved wednesday to make 
banks disclose annual percentage yields and fees on savings and 
other deposit accounts but only after weakening the ability of 
consumers to sue if they dont 
the truth in savings legislation was approved unanimously by 
the house banking committees subcommittee on consumer affairs 
after it was amended to allow only actual account holders to sue 
over false advertising or other violations 
the bill is intended to outlaw what rep richard lehman 
dcalif the panels chairman called teaser rates and other 
misleading advertising by banks and other financial institutions in 
trying to attract deposits 
peggy miller of the consumer federation of america said banks 
now use snake oil practices to lure deposits and then play 
deceitful games through service fees undisclosed withdrawal 
penalties and inconsistent disclosures to cheat consumers out of 
earning the advertised yield on their accounts 
as an example she cited one days issue of the washington post 
in which advertisements for various financial institutions used 11 
different yield terms to describe the interest rates they were 
offering to depositors 
consumers confronted with this broad array of terminology can 
only throw up their hands in hopeless confusion and hope that they 
get the best deal possible she said 
the bill requires that banks savings and loans and credit 
unions clearly and conspicuously give the annual percentage yield 
most prominence in their advertising and also disclose any minimum 
balances necessary and the annual rate of simple interest 
the financial institutions also have to maintain and disclose 
fee schedules and terms and conditions applicable to each class of 
accounts they offer in order to provide consumers a meaningful 
way to compare deposit instruments 
account holders who believe those conditions were violated could 
sue for damages and attorneys fees plus penalities of 100 to 
1000 as an indiviudal or up to 500000 or 1 percent of an 
institutions net worth in classaction suits 
lehmans original version allowed anyone to file such a suit 
but it was amended on a 96 vote to cover only current account 
holders or those who had closed an account with the past year 
the amendment was approved after federal reserve board member 
martha seeger complained the sweeping civil liability 
provisions subject institutions to costly litigation by the 
public at large 
ms miller however said the amendment opens a loophole in 
which consumers who paid upfront application fees to open accounts 
but never actually did could never recover what they lost 
the bill was generally supported by banking groups after they 
succeeded in thwarting earlier attempts by lawmakers to make them 
adopt uniform methods for compounding interest accruals daily 
similar legislation was approved last year by both the house and 
senate but died in the waning days of the 100th congress a 
virtually identical bill except that it also applies to mutual 
funds has been introduced in the senate this year by sen 
christopher dodd dconn

the west denver residents gave clearance to build a 23 billion 
airport and pittsburghs jewish grandmother won the 
allimportant democratic nomination for mayor 
in other elections tuesday voters rejected tax overhauls in 
pennsylvania and oregon and approved a tucson ariz school bond 
package totaling 398 million 10 times the amount of a similar 
measure that was rejected last year 
in pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff 71 won the primary and 
practically guaranteed herself victory in november she was city 
council president last year when she was appointed to succeed the 
late mayor richard s caliguiri 
denver voters sided 63 percent to 37 percent with mayor federico 
pena and gov roy romer agreeing it was time to replace 
60yearold stapleton international airport the nations fifth 
largest with an airport 20 miles from downtown 
it would be the nations first new airport since dallasfort 
worth international opened in 1974 pena and romer said stapleton 
was overcrowded and obsolete opponents said the plan was 
unnecessary and too costly 
seattle residents approved an initiative that restricts the 
density of buildings downtown and limits their height to 450 feet 
about 38 stories for the next 10 years while a longrange 
development plan is adopted 
the citys tallest building is the 76story columbia center 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting the count was 42643 to 
26303 with only a simple majority required 
voters delivered setbacks to govs robert p casey of 
pennsylvania and neil goldschmidt of oregon who put their 
reputations behind proposals to overhaul their states taxes 
pennsylvania voters turned back 75 percent to 25 percent a 
referendum that would have allowed counties to impose income taxes 
in exchange for a reduction in property taxes 
also defeated was a philadelphia proposal to legalize charity 
raffles and other small games of chance 
oregonians rejected 59 percent to 41 percent a measure that 
would have updated tax bases in about a third of the states school 
districts effectively allowing them to raise property taxes

afghan rebels said wednesday they 
have not abandoned their fight for the besieged eastern city of 
jalalabad but are reorganizing for assaults on other 
communistheld cities in afghanistan 
the moslem guerrillas and western diplomats reported fresh 
fighting in the wartorn country including the destruction by 
guerrillas of a northern ammunition dump laden with soviet weapons 
a sevenparty guerrilla alliance based in pakistan issued a 
statement wednesday describing reports they had given up the fight 
for jalalabad as baseless 
an afghan foreign ministry spokesman told western reporters in 
kabul the capital tuesday that guerrillas had given up on 
jalalabad and turned their attention on khost about 84 miles to 
the south 
rebels confirmed the fighting at khost and said a recent lull in 
fighting at jalalabad probably was due to a visit there by 
guerrilla leader yunis khalis 
khalis elderly head of the hardline hezbiislami rebel group 
is reportedly meeting with field commanders to map out new tactics 
to break a nearly threemonth old stalemate at jalalabad 
communist government forces finally launched a counterattack 
late last week but guerrillas pushed them back using some of their 
own captured tanks according to combined reports 
the rebels backed primarily by pakistan and the united states 
have vowed to fight on until the collapse of kabuls ruling 
marxists and the establishment of an islamic republic of 
afghanistan 
the peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized power in a 
bloody 1978 military coup sparking the moslem insurgency soviet 
forces intervened in december 1979 to prop up the government but 
finally withdrew in february under a unbrokered acord 
with a harsh winter behind them the rebels say they are 
preparing major assaults on kabul and the southeastern city of 
kandahar 
one rebel commander mohammad nasir said about 30000 rebels 
were organizing to attack the heavily fortified capital as early as 
this weekend 
however a rival commander said he thought nasir was boasting 
we are making careful plans for kabul to avoid the same 
mistakes as jalalabad said abdul haq of the khalis faction 
reputed to be the most powerful of rebel commanders in the kabul 
area 
he was referring to criticism that rebels attacked jalalabad 
before they were sufficiently armed and organized 
were working on detailed plans as to how and when but 
im not going to print my plans in the newspapers haq said on a 
visit to peshawar pakistan 
rebel sources said some rebel commanders are holding out for 
negotiations with government troops in order to avoid civilian 
bloodshed 
rebel reorts wednesday said guerrillas blew up a major 
ammunition dumpat mazarisharif capital of northern balkh 
province some 36 miles from the soviet border around may 7 
masood khalili a spokesman of the jamiatiislami rebel group 
said the blast killed 360 communist soldiers and wounded 100 he 
said at least 175 sovietbuilt tanks and armored personnel carriers 
were destroyed in two days of fires and secondary explosions 
unconfirmed reports said the communists plan to shift their 
capital to mazarisharif if kabul falls to the rebels 
in another development a soviet official in london charged 
wednesday that the united states and pakistan have failed to honor 
the accord on afghanistan by continuing to provide military and 
moral support to the guerrillas 
pakistan and the united states when they were signing the 
geneva accords it se they cant tell 
authorities wh options to utilize said rep frank pallone jr 
as a house rine and fisheries subcommittee 
presentations on a range of technologies used he subcommittee in its second 
day of reports on compliance 
with the ocean dumping act of 1988 examined ways that nine new 
york and new jersey sludge dumpers could dispose of their wastes 
and meet the dec 31 1991 deadline to cease sludge dumping 
sally lentz staff attorney for the nonprofit oceanic society 
said a lawsuit filed by six new jersey communities against epa to 
challenge stiff fines being imposed for an inability to stop 
dumping by 1991 has set back the process and could jeopardize the 
publics input into local compliance plans 
ms lentz also cautioned the committee that it is virtually 
impossible to quantify environmental damage from sludge dumped at a 
designated site 106 miles off the new jersey shore and on that 
basis said she was disappointed in the way the epa has discounted 
potential health effects linked to sludge 
new jersey democratic rep william j hughes said garden state 
communities trying to implement dumping alternatives could benefit 
from an information clearinghouse however he was quick to praise 
the epas overall performance in encouraging compliance from the 
dumpers 
i recognize its often popular to jump on the environmental 
protection agency my constituents want us to stop dumping 
yesterday hughes said 
region ii of the epa is making an impressive and enormous 
effort said lynne edgerton a coastal protection attorney with 
the natural resources defense council however she warned that 
communities commitment to a single solution such as incineration 
excludes any opportunity to reuse this material 
l jack davis a former epa regional administrator in atlanta 
and dallas who now serves as president of dallasbased oxidyne 
corp acknowledged the need to provide guidance to communities 
seeking to dispose of their sludge 
epa has a very undirected research program said davis 
whose company injects the sludge and organic waste into a miledeep 
well where it is treated and converted into carbon dioxide ash 
and water that requires further purification 
david greenhut director of marketing and new product 
development for kubota america corp said kubota transforms sludge 
into a chemically stable glasslike material which in turn is 
used in the production of ceramic tiles cinder blocks ground 
cover drainage fill and in asphaltic and cement mixes 
the kubota endproduct contains the metals found in sewage 
sludge but in an inert form he said japan has approved the final 
product as a substitute for landfill sand improving agent for poor 
drainage land antiwater penetrant agent for tennis courts and 
playgrounds pavement material for lightload roads and bedding for 
pipes 
ernest a kollitides president and chief operating officer of 
dehydrotech corp of east hanover nj said his firm has been 
using its patented carvergreenfield process to evaporate the 
liquid from sludge using a light oil with that process which is 
being installed at sludge plants in mercer and ocean counties in 
new jersey the resulting dry solids can be used as fertilizer or 
as fuel to produce steam and electricity 
the leftover water is clean and requires only minimal 
treatment he said and the oilsoluble compounds in the sludge are 
removed such as pesticides herbicides polychlorinated biphenyls 
dioxins and cleaning fluids 
kollitides said mercer county improvement authority communities 
in new jersey will feed raw sludge to their carvergreenfield 
facility which will produce fertilizer and burn sewage oil from 
the sludge to produce steam to power the process

loyal troops battled rebel soldiers 
in the capital wednesday and the president cut short a state visit 
to east germany to try to crush the coup attempt reports said the 
mutineers control a key northern city 
the defense minister was slain by rebel soldiers in the revolt 
which began tuesday and troops killed two rebellious generals 
according to government sources and state radio the total number 
of dead was not known 
government sources said the rebellious generals were among five 
coup leaders and that soldiers and police hunted for the other 
three 
after a pitched tank and artillery battle on the outskirts and 
firefights in town wednesday addis ababa appeared calm and under 
control of the marxist government of president mengistu haile 
mariam the soviet unions strongest ally in africa 
reports from the wartorn north however indicate thousands of 
soldiers there support the coup bid and have control of asmara 
ethiopias second largest city they were broadcasting messages 
declaring the coup a success on a frequency normally used by the 
government radio station there 
addis ababa radio repeatedly reported the revolt was crushed 
in addis itself its increasingly looking like a failed coup 
but it appears to be a very different story in other parts of the 
country and especially in the north said a western diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
described the situation in ethiopia as fluid and uncertain 
he said it was not clear if the coup had been put down and cited 
reports wednesdsay that fighting has broken out again among 
military units in addis ababa 
mengistu who has ruled this strategic horn of africa nation for 
15 years cut short a state visit to communist east germany and 
arrived home wednesday addis ababa radio said he was met by prime 
minister fikre selassie wogderes and vice president fiseha desta 
it said 
the airport has been closed since tuesday in addition to the 
capitals schools businesses and shops state radio urged 
residents to stay home 
air traffic controllers wednesday advised commercial and private 
pilots of the danger of being shot down by dissident troops over 
asmara capital of secessionistminded eritrea province 
asmara is headquarters of ethiopias 2nd army 150000 soldiers 
that diplomats and rebels believe support the coup 
the western diplomat in addis ababa said it was not known 
whether the army has handed its arms to the secessionist eritrean 
peoples liberation front or whether it was continuing to fight the 
government on its own 
a spokesman for the eritrean rebels in rome said eritrea is 
under the control of rebellious elements in the ethiopian army 
they have managed to dominate the situation they are fighting 
the regime 
according to reports monitored in london by the british 
broadcasting corp a radio station describing itself as the 
voice of ethiopia located in asmara said eritrean rebel forces 
had imposed a nighttime curfew on the town 
the bbc also monitored a report on the rebels voice of the 
broad masses of eritrea that quoted asmara radio as saying 
tuesday that mengistu had been ousted 
the capitals residents awoke to sounds of a heavy tank and 
artillery battle at a military compound on the outskirts 
it was thunderous said the diplomat you could feel 
buildings shaking here in the city 
after that things calmed down for a while but then there 
were several fairly severe firefights around town he said 
what we think was happening is that loyal troops were flushing 
out insurgents who were in hiding 
by midafternoon it was calm he said but the situation is 
obviously quite tense and the army is everywhere 
an african military attache in addis ababa said the army 
garrison in harar eastern ethiopia also is supporting coup 
leaders and that negotiations are under way in addis ababa between 
loyalists and dissidents 
things are bad the attache said it is just that they 
the government are not saying 
addis ababa radio said maj gen merid negusie the chief of 
staff and the air force commander maj gen amha desta were 
killed tuesday by loyalists 
the station made no mention of wednesdays fighting 
government sources said they expect an official announcement 
soon of the death of the defense minister maj gen haile giorgis 
habte mariam 
government sources said troops are searching for coup plotters 
they identified as industry minister fanta belay who used to 
command the air force aberra abdualem chief of operations in the 
defense ministry and kumalapchew dejene deputy commander of armed 
forces in eritrea 
there have been persistent reports of military unrest in 
ethiopia especially among field commanders who reportedly believe 
the government has not supported them adequately in the 28yearold 
northern civil war 
the military deposed emperor haile selassie in a coup on sept 
12 1974 after factional fighting within in the armed forces 
mengistu then an army major seized power 
mengistu inherited the northern insurrections in which his 
forces recently have suffered humiliating defeats 
the ethiopian army is africas best equipped and the continents 
largest although many of its quarter of a million troops are 
unwilling conscripts

a senate panel wednesday approved legislation 
to lift remaining price controls on natural gas by 1993 nudging 
the energy industry one step closer to a longsought prize it says 
will benefit consumers as well as commerce 
experts generally agree that natural gas prices would be 
unlikely to rise immediately in reaction to ending price controls 
since the market price currently is well below the controlled 
price many industry officials predict however that growing 
demand for gas in the 1990s would likely push prices substantially 
higher 
with only sen howard metzenbaum dohio voicing strenuous 
objections the senate energy and natural resources committee 
approved the bill 172 the full senate may consider the bill as 
early next week although the timing was uncertain 
the house passed a nearly identical bill last month with 
virtually no dissent 
the legislation is strongly supported by the bush 
administration which has made gas decontrol a key feature of its 
evolving energy policy president bush echoing industry arguments 
in favor of decontrol has said the move would restore freemarket 
forces in an industry that has been under federal price controls 
since 1954 
industry groups have said price decontrol would stimulate more 
production of natural gas which currently accounts for about 
onequarter of the nations energy supply 
the legislation would complete a price decontrol process that 
began in 1978 with the natural gas policy act which removed price 
limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen 
categories of gas each with a ceiling price 
some consumer groups have opposed the gas decontrol bill saying 
that while it might not trigger an immediate price rise it does 
nothing to correct other regulatory problems that mean higher costs 
to the 48 million households that use natural gas 
industrial users of natural gas generally favor the legislation 
it will stimulate new production and make more natural gas 
available at cheaper prices said jerry jasinowski chief 
economist of the national assocation of manufacturers 
metzenbaum a longstanding opponent of gas decontrol said he 
suspected the major oil companies that own about 45 percent of the 
nations gas reserves are holding a lot of gas off the market until 
the federal price controls are removed 
you may bet all the tea in china that natural gas prices will 
go up and go up substantially within a few years if price 
controls are ended he said calling the bill the most 
anticonsumer piece of legislation we have ever enacted 
sen bill bradley dnj also voted against the bill he said 
however that his position was based mainly on concern about how 
the legislation might affect federal regulatory authority over 
natural gas transportation he said he might reconsider his vote 
depending on how the transport issue was resolved on the senate 
floor 
the only major difference between the house and senate bills is 
that the house version would lift price controls on newly drilled 
wells immediately instead of in 1993 the senate bill has no such 
provision 
about onethird of us natural gas currently is subject to 
federal price controls

chinese long have complained about corruption and 
their lack of basic freedoms but they dared not protest until a 
plucky group of students with the same grievances staged a defiant 
hunger strike 
inspired by the 3000 students fasting for democracy in 
tiananmen square the chinese masses have found their voice and for 
the first time are telling their communist leaders loud and clear 
what they think of their rule 
in a massive show of dissatisfaction more than 1 million people 
including workers students and even government employees 
poured into central beijing on wednesday to support the hunger 
strikers who are fasting to press student demands for more freedom 
and clean government 
as they marched up and down the broad avenues of the nations 
capital workers and students chanted down with official 
profiteering and oppose corruption 
some boldly called on premier li peng and chinas senior leader 
deng xiaoping to resign they consider li too conservative and the 
84yearold deng too old a student standing on top of a school bus 
repeatedly shouted li peng and the crowd replied step 
down 
just a few weeks ago said a 38yearold auto worker who was 
marching with hundreds of his colleagues such a display would have 
been unthinkable i absolutely would not have believed this could 
happen he said 
the protests result from a general dissatisfaction has been 
growing for some time 
in the past 10 years chinas economy has made a remarkable 
recovery under dengs pragmatic marketoriented policies but 
widespread corruption by communist officials and dismay that 
political liberalization has proceeded at a much slower pace than 
economic reform has caused increased grumbling 
privately chinese relate their latest brush with corrupt 
officials or criticize the lack of democracy but before last 
month only a handful of intellectuals dared speak out 
chinas most prominent critic was astrophysicist fang lizhi 
whose international prestige as a scientist probably protects him 
from extreme government action 
when the students first began demonstrating for democracy after 
the death of former communist party leader hu yaobang workers 
obviously were sympathetic 
students who marched through beijing received cheers and 
donations but many workers still were frightened to join the 
processions 
the hunger strikers have changed that 
workers were touched by the students plight and the resolve of 
the hungerstrikers remained strong while their health 
deteriorated the widespread admiration for the fasters whose 
goals are shared by many chinese was obvious wednesday 
theyre hearts are bleeding said one laborer they have 
been on hunger strike for several days the workers can no longer 
be silent 
many people said that the students demands such as a dialogue 
with the government were reasonable and should be accepted by the 
government to end the strike 
but the delay in resolving the impasse has bolstered the student 
protest with hundreds of thousands of workers and other supporters 
who otherwise might have stayed silent 
one poster in tiananmen square on wednesday summed up the new 
order the students are the vanguard the workers are the backup 
force

the foreign ministry claimed wednesday 
the united states was continuing to support guerrilla war by 
nicaraguan rebels and said it had complained to washington 
the ministry said more than 1000 people on both sides had been 
killed or wounded this year and that the rebels known as contras 
attacked military or civilian targets 58 times in the first half of 
may alone 
contra spokesmen denied the claims accusing nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government of trying through propaganda to avoid 
complying with a regional peace agreement 
nicaraguas protest was contained in a letter to secretary of 
state james a baker iii from jose leon talavera the deputy 
foreign minister 
if the united states is truly interested in advancing toward a 
solution of the central american crisis it should begin by 
respecting the will of central americans themselves talavera 
said in the letter dated may 16 
barricada the newspaper of the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front published the letter wednesday and ministry 
spokesman david silva said it had been sent to baker 
last month congress approved 48 million in nonlethal aid to 
keep the contras intact through feb 25 1990 when general 
elections are scheduled in nicaragua 
about 10000 contras are in jungle camps in neighboring honduras 
along with 11000 family members most of the rebels left nicaragua 
after contra and sandinista leaders signed a temporary truce in 
march 1988 
since then the sandinistas have extended the truce unilaterally 
on a monthbymonth basis and only sporadic skirmishes had been 
reported 
talavera said in the letter however that contras attacked 58 
times in the period may 115 so far this year he said the 
contras had killed 47 civilians wounded 38 and kidnapped 131 
he said the army had suffered 309 casualties and the contras 707 
since jan 1 but did not give a breakdown of dead and wounded 
the letter to baker said the account of actions against my 
country is more than enough to show that your governments current 
policy is not contributing toward peace in central america 
wilfredo montalvan a member of the nicaraguan resistance 
directorate denied the letters claims 
the sandinista regime has always wanted to present the civil 
war which is now suspended as yankee aggression he said in a 
telephone interview from miami the sandinistas use that old 
tactic every time they find themselves in difficulties and 
want to avoid fulfilling the peace agreement montalvan said 
contra spokesman jorge rosales also in miami said 20003000 
rebels remain in nicaragua and have been strictly observing the 
ceasefire he claimed the sandinista army attacked rebels and 
their sympathizers but he would not give casualty figures 
talavera said any aid not intended to dismantle the contras goes 
against the will of the presidents of nicaragua el salvador 
honduras costa rica and guatemala and serves to continue the war 
the presidents signed a regional peace pact feb 14 in el 
salvador in which nicaragua promised more democracy and also agreed 
to draft a plan by may 15 to disband the contras most of whom are 
in neighboring honduras 
at the request of president jose napoleon duarte of el salvador 
the deadline was extended until an unspecified date in july after 
the inauguration of his successor alfredo cristiani

all 19 members of the senate foreign relations 
committee urged president bush on wednesday to ask soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to clarify the soviet commitment to the treaty 
banning mediumrange nucleararmed missiles worldwide 
the senators said they were disturbed by a recent remarks by 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that the soviets might 
not dismantle their ss23 mediumrange missiles as required by the 
treaty if nato nations modernize their shortrange nuclear weapons 
sen nancy landon kassebaum rkan an organizer of the 
letterwriting effort noted that the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty does not ban shortrange missiles with a range under 
300 miles 
therefore she said modernization by nato of such shortrange 
missiles would not violate the treaty 
we find these remarks very troubling the committee members 
told bush 
mr shevardnadzes suggestion that the soviets might not abide 
by the terms of the treaty in response to the modernization of 
systems which are not covered by the treaty threatens to challenge 
the integrity of the inf accord as well as overall confidence in 
the arms control process they said 
it is in neither sides interest at this time to challenge 
that agreement the senators said both sides should instead be 
building on the achievements of the inf accord and moving forward 
to take advantage of the many promising opportunities before us in 
eastwest relations 
the senators urged the president to seek a clarification from 
general secretary gorbachev as to the soviets commitments to the 
inf accord and to consult with us on these developments 
the senate ratified the inf treaty on a 935 roll call last year 
after a lengthy debate

as i write these lines under the windows of the editorial 
offices the crowd is whistling and from hand to hand passes a 
petition not to remove the investigator from the work he has 
already begun he wrote 
and when yakovlev said at a public meeting that he could not 
forgive gdlyan for his handling of johannes hint the estonian 
scientist he was drowned out by the whistles stamping and 
shouting of the irritated crowd 
yakovlev protested that the soviet public must learn that we 
mustnt obtain just results with unjust methods 
weve all come out of decades of lawlessness they cost us so 
dearly that people are prepared to fight lawlessness on the 
principle that any means are all right he wrote

african national congress leader 
nelson mandela on wednesday received a law degree he earned through 
a correspondence course while serving his life prison term 
mandela 70 who holds several honorary law degrees did the 
course work for his bachelor of laws degree through the university 
of south africa one of the largest correspondence schools in the 
world 
the degree was awarded in his absence at a ceremony at cape town 
city hall while mandela remained incarcerated in a house at the 
victor verster prison farm near paarl 30 miles to the northeast 
university spokesman chip joubert said mandela was invited but 
returned the form saying he would be unable to attend joubert 
said the diploma would be mailed 
mandelas name was listed on the eighth page of a glossy program 
handed to the 1000 people who attended the graduation but his 
name was not read out 
three bachelor of law degrees were awarded and one recipient 
shaun sheehan 30 was present sheehan said he had been in the 
room next to mandela when mandela was treated at tygerberg hospital 
last year for tuberculosis sheehan said he was a bit sad 
mandela could not attend the ceremony 
mandela received a bachelor of arts degree through 
correspondence courses in 1941 and worked as an attorney in 
johannesburg through the early 1950s his law partner was oliver 
tambo who went into exile when the anc was outlawed in 1960 and is 
now president of the guerrilla organization 
an attorney without a law degree can represent clients advise 
them take care of legal documents for them file suits and the 
like but cannot argue before the high courts where most major 
cases are decided 
a bachelor of laws degree would allow mandela to become an 
advocate and argue major cases before the regional supreme courts 
if he were not in prison 
mandela was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for sabotage and 
conspiracy to topple the whiteminority government at the time he 
had been in prison for three years for incitement and leaving the 
country illegally 
marinus weichers head of the department of constitutional law 
at the university said mandela is a very good accomplished 
lawyer 
mandela family friend and biographer fatima meer said mandela 
had difficulty getting the right reference books and had to study 
under trying circumstances the fact that he has accomplished his 
llb degree is an indication of the capacity he has to cling on to 
hope she said 
very few people have that kind of faith and the ability to 
transform that gift into reality that is the reason why we want 
him out and that is the reason why we want him to head the 
country

the house postponed action until next week on 
a multibillion dollar domestic spending bill when democrats and 
republicans became embroiled wednesday in a dispute over antidrug 
spending 
the stall occurred despite outcries from the bush 
administration lawmakers and veterans groups that 340 million in 
the measure for veterans health programs was needed as soon as 
possible 
the dispute began when house appropriations committee chairman 
jamie whitten dmiss attempted to bring a 37 billion 
supplemental spending bill for this year to the house floor 
republicans blocked whitten with a procedural move with rep 
bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house budget 
committee arguing that the measure would be veto bait 
bush administration officials have said they would urge the 
president to veto the bill unless 822 million it contains for 
antidrug programs is removed 
rep silvio conte of massachusetts ranking republican on the 
appropriations committee offered a bill bearing only the 340 
million for veterans but majority democrats refused to allow it to 
be debated 
democrats claimed republicans simply dont want to put extra 
federal muscle into efforts to crack down on illegal drug 
trafficking 
theres only one thing holding up this bill said rep neal 
smith diowa chairman of the appropriations justice subcommittee 
the administration does not want this congress to appropriate any 
more money for crime and drugs 
in addition several liberal democrats are attempting to amend 
the measure with language that would transfer about 900 million 
next year from the star wars antimissile program to antidrug 
initiatives 
secretary edward derwinski of the department of veterans affairs 
on wednesday called the need for money a real emergency a day 
earlier he warned in a letter that a delay in the money would mean 
gradual reductions in numbers of workers delays in purchasing 
medical equipment and a halt in construction projects 
the house does not plan to consider the measure again until next 
week the senate leaves town this week for a memorial day recess 
and does not return until may 31 
last month a 47 billion version of the spending measure had 
been pulled off the house floor after objections that it was too 
expensive 
the appropriations committee had stripped 1 billion from it for 
the costs of fighting last years forest fires the federal 
aviation administration the homeless public housing reparations 
to japaneseamericans who were kept in camps during world war ii 
and other programs

complaints by palau of inadequate 
development and economic dependency under us administration are a 
bargaining tactic to get more money from washington a un 
investigative mission said wednesday 
the british and french diplomats and un officials who visited 
palau in april also said soviet claims of militarization of the 
pacific archipelago were groundless 
according to their report the only united states military 
presence in palau is a small us navy detachment the seabees 
numbering 21 men which is doing construction work at the request 
of the local authorities 
soviet diplomats environmentalists and peace activists have 
accused the pentagon of planning to establish bases in the islands 
possibly armed with nuclear weapons 
the investigators sent by the un trusteeship council found 
palauans concerned with the level of compensation and the manner 
in which such compensation would be negotiated rather than the 
possible end use of the land 
as regards the nuclear issue this was scarcely raised in 
the course of the missions visit they said in particular it 
was not brought up as a subject of major significance in any of the 
missions meetings with political leaders of all persuasions 
palau is the only chain of islands still under un trust 
supervision 
vice president kuniwo nakamura of palau said monday the 
territory was economically weak with inadequate health and social 
services and the united states had failed in its duty as trustee 
in its evaluation the un mission praised us support for 
political development and the archipelagos education system 
it said of palauan complaints about economic development and 
social conditions 
among the problems frequently cited as examples were the 
inadequacy of the road system except in koror and the limitations 
of the hospital system 
in view of the considerable sums of money spent by the 
administering authority in the past in the field of economic and 
social development and of additional commitments under the 
proposed new status arrangements the mission considers that this 
attitude largely reflects tactical considerations 
the complaints were aimed at obtaining additional concessions 
from the us executive and legislative branches at a time when 
delicate negotiations have just begun between the united states 
authorities and palauan officials the mission declared 
in 1988the 15000 people of palau received about 33 million in 
us aid jeanmichel gaussot of france and j stephen smith of 
britain led the mission for the trusteeship council which is 
evaluating palaus progress toward adopting the proposed compact of 
free association with the united states 
that agreement would make the islands selfgoverning but leave 
the united states in charge of defense with the right to use land 
for any purpose it deemed necessary in exchange for 1 billion in 
aid over 75 years about 460 million of the us aid would be paid 
in the first 15 years 
us officials deny planning to establish military bases last 
year however adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs 
told a congressional committee palau would be one of the first or 
priority areas we would have to look at if the united states lost 
its bases in the philippines 
palaus constitution bars nuclear weapons and nuclear power from 
its territory a majority of palauans have favored the compact in 
several referendums but it has not won the 75 percent needed to 
overrule the constitutional ban 
the united states captured the archipelago and other pacific 
islands from japan in world war ii it consists of 200 islands 
totaling 192 square miles about 500 miles east of the philippine 
island of mindanao

the president of the university of utah on 
wednesday defended the schools roomtemperature fusion claims 
saying there is only a 1 percent chance they are as skeptics say 
the result of laboratory error 
chase peterson told state legislators that scientists have 
failed to disprove the claims of chemists martin fleischmann and 
stanley pons who contend they have sustained nuclear fusion in a 
tabletop experiment 
peterson said others have failed to duplicate the results 
because the experiment is difficult and takes time 
there has been no disproving data peterson said the work 
has been described as simple but its really very difficult 
electrochemistry 
in separate state house and senate appearances university 
officials said pons a utah professor and fleischmann of the 
university of southampton in england continue to report dramatic 
results 
james brophy the universitys vice president for research said 
the experiment produces 100 times the energy needed to run it 
pons goal is a 1000to1 ratio brophy said 
when they announced their discovery at a march 23 news 
conference pons and fleischmann said they had achieved 4to1 
ratio 
levels have been boosted by a change in the apparatus 
specifically an increase in the size of the palladium electrode 
brophy said 
legislators who last month voted overwhelmingly to appropriate 
5 million to support the research offered no criticism of the 
claims 
peterson said a small portion of the 5 million has been spent 
on patent research and applications the rest is in escrow until an 
independent panel of scientists and businessmen decides the 
experiment has been confirmed 
pons and fleischmann have been derided by other scientists for 
their claim if fusion which powers the sun can be created at 
room temperature it could be a cheap and safe source of energy 
peterson said pons and fleischmann must ignore the public debate 
and focus on their research without elaborating he dismissed the 
chance of fundamental laboratory errors as a 1 in 100 possibility 
peterson also said private corporations continue to show a 
strong interest in the project with 45 companies having e signed 
confidential disclosure agreements that permit them to review the 
schools patent applications 
he declined to identify any of the companies except 
westinghouse which has acknowledged sending its officials to the 
utah campus to review the project

form 85 percent of the population 
the meeting underscored a continuing feud between liberal and

serbian communists who rejected them as based on official 
albanian propaganda

north korea accused south korean troops wednesday 
of firing on a north korean post in the demilitarized zone between 
the countries 
it was entirely thanks to the patience and selfrestraint of 
the civil policemen of our side that this incident was not expanded 
into an armed conflict between the two sides pyongyangs 
official korean central news agency said 
the agencys report monitored in tokyo did not mention any 
injuries but said the alleged firing gravely threatened the 
safety of the north korean policemen and destroyed equipment 
the agency said south korean troops fired scores of bullets 
from automatic rifles at a north korean post in the demilitarized 
zone at around 638 pm wednesday 
in another report the official news agency accused the united 
states of daily aerial espionage by u2 highaltitude 
reconnaissance planes 
the agency said the u2s were flown along the military 
demarcation line between north and south korea and that the united 
states also had brought an e3a awacs plane into south korea for 
spying on the north 
it said us spy planes had flown 100 such reconnaissance 
missions in the first half of may or about seven per day 
this shows that the us imperial aggressors persistently seek 
confrontation and war on the korean peninsula the kcna report 
said 
the communist north and capitalist south divided since 1945 
fought a bloody war in 195053 
the two sides which technically remain at war since no peace 
treaty was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 reportedly 
have held a series of secret talks on measures to ease tensions on 
the korean peninsula

the former chief army psychologist faulted the 
army on wednesday for failing to develop specially trained 
antiriot forces to deal with the palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories 
reuven gal a reserve colonel who heads an independent military 
study center told reporters that despite its excellent combat 
history the army was doing very poorly in coping with the 
violence that has killed more than 480 palestinians since dec 8 
1987 
he said that in the 22 years since israel seized the west bank 
and gaza strip from arab control the army never viewed controlling 
the territory as a prime mission and subsequently failed to develop 
special units 
the mystery is how come after a year and a half of the 
intefadeh uprising they havent caught up gal told a 
governmentsponsored briefing 
the israel defense forces are usually very quick to adapt to 
new situations with new weapons and new tactics but until now 
there is not a single base in the idf where soldiers train 
specifically for riot control 
gal who heads the israel institute for military studies in 
zichron yaacov said the army commanders resisted change because 
they were combatoriented and did not want to turn the idf into a 
police force 
he said that because of the armys neithernor way of handling 
the intefadeh in the end they come up as both immoral and 
ineffective at the same time 
gal the armys chief psychologist from 197782 said police 
duties also interfered with the motivation to be combat soldiers 
especially in the regular army 
a us state department report on human rights criticized the 
israeli armys lack of training and experience in riot control 
saying it contributed to a high number of human rights violations 
col renaan gissin the army deputy spokesman acknowledged that 
the army had created no special branch to deal with riot control 
and had no central base for preparing troops for duty in the 
occupied lands 
but he said the army recently deployed three new companies of 
border police and three to four companies of mechanized infantry 
who are specially trained to deal with civil unrest a company 
contains about 100 soldiers 
it took time nearly a year to develop and train them 
gissin said in an interview 
he said the army now gives special orientation and training to 
all units that serve in occupied areas and built models of west 
bank streets for the units to practice 
the army which maintained about 10000 troops on average in the 
occupied lands in 1988 was not able to develop a larger force for 
the west bank and gaza because of budgetary restraints gissin 
said 
he listed the intefadeh as the armys third priority after 
preparing for allout war and guarding against terror attacks 
the army has spent about 250 million on the uprising

eight immigration and naturalization service 
agents paid a heavy price in possible reprisals for their 
honesty in telling congress they were asked to falsify their time 
cards the chairman of a house panel said wednesday 
the general accounting office said it has found circumstantial 
evidence that indicates that ins management retaliated against the 
eight antismuggling unit agents and two supervisors after the 
agents complained in a letter to members of congress about 
procedures at the houston district office 
the agents said in the september 1987 letter that they were 
being assigned part of the time to contact employers about the 1986 
immigration law and sanctions for hiring illegal aliens the ins 
instructed the agents to record the time spent on employer 
relations as antismuggling hours they said 
the gao probe found that after the letter surfaced one agent 
and two supervisors were pressured to take unwanted transfers five 
agents and one supervisor received low appraisals even though 
management could not provide evidence of poor performance and all 
six had been highly appraised the previous year the investigation 
found 
these agents have paid a heavy price for their courage and 
honesty said rep jack brooks chairman of the house judiciary 
committee who requested the probe by gao the investigative branch 
of congress 
this is one more example where agency management went after 
the whistleblowers rather then the wrongdoers the texas democrat 
said it is my understanding that ins recently has taken steps to 
reinstate the houston antismuggling unit and its agents however 
i think its time for the attorney general to consider making 
immediate changes to ins management 
although the gao said it cannot make a legal determination 
whether retaliation occurred it recommended the ins commissioner 
remedy troublesome management problems in houston 
the gao said houston district management was wrong to direct 
antismuggling personnel to record employer relations hours as 
antismuggling work the gao also faulted the ins dallas office for 
investigating the agents after they wrote the letter 
the actions taken against the employees were inconsistent with 
ins policies or were not adequately documented by ins the gao 
said moreover the timing of the actions and the lack of 
adequate documentation as to why they were taken lead us to believe 
they they could be the result at least in part of the agents 
letter 
houston district director ronald parra defended the actions 
taken against the agents saying the agents felt they were more 
of the miami vice mode and it was beneath their dignity to educate 
employers about the new legislation 
it was a very cutanddried situation these officers were not 
doing adequate work performance parra said and statistics 
corroborate that very decisively very significantly that they did 
not follow these orders 
ins management officials in houston discussed the letter in a 
conference call with officials of the agencys southern regional 
office in dallas the day the regional commissioner stephen martin 
received a copy of the agents letter the gao study said 
according to a tape recording of the conversation parra stated 
we dont want to come down with a heavy hand on them we can take 
care of this in a much more subtle and executive fashion 
martin was livid at the fact these individuals had written to 
their congressmen and made all these allegations and wanted to 
fire the entire group parra said wednesday he said martin was 
from the private sector and was apparently unaware that federal 
employees have a right to contact members of congress 
but parra said houston management had already been discussing 
performance problems by the agents and supervisors when martin 
became aware of the letter the dallas office was behind 
authorizing transfers of the three men parra said

two us drug agents fooled by the same 
confidential informant were charged with bribery for allegedly 
offering to protect drug money ripoffs federal authorities 
said wednesday 
investigators described a miami vice plot two longtime 
respected agents caught with the help of a doublecrossing 
informant in an undercover operation using wiretaps hidden 
microphones and misinformation 
in both cases when the agent suspects were told the informant 
had been arrested they told fellow dea agents they were working 
with the informant in undercover operations authorities said 
drew bunnell and al iglesias special agents of the drug 
enforcement administration appeared wednesday before us 
magistrate peter palermo 
bunnell who had been with the dea in ecuador was ordered held 
without bond pending a hearing monday and iglesias who lives in 
miami was set for release on a signature bond wednesday evening 
a dea official in miami who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said bunnell had nine years experience and iglesias 14 bunnell 
and iglesias are on administrative leave with pay pending 
prosecution the official said 
the reaction is one of dismay said the official but the 
other guys go on about their jobs putting their lives on the 
line 
the investigation began in july 1988 authorities said when the 
unidentified informant told the dea he had met with bunnell in 
december 1987 and discussed ripping off cocaine money 
that began a series of deamonitored telephone calls between the 
informant either from miami or an undisclosed city in south 
carolina and bunnell in guayaquil ecuador authorities said 
the informant led bunnell to believe he had taken 215000 in 
cocaine traffickers money authorities said bunnell received 
7000 and had expected to receive 100000 authorities said 
on jan 10 a dea agent in savannah ga called bunnell in 
miami to say the informant had been stopped carrying large amounts 
of cash but told agents he was working with bunnell on a case 
authorities said 
bunnell said the informant was working with him the dea said 
on april 18 the informant called iglesias a prominent dea 
agent in miami from south carolina to say cocaine dealers there 
would pay the informant 150000 to buy cocaine for them in miami 
authorities said 
iglesias told the informant he could work with the dea or he 
could keep the money himself and iglesias would cover it up and 
protect him from the cocaine dealers investigators said 
after many deataped phone calls authorities said the 
informant offered iglesias 15000 iglesias declined but later 
accepted 700 to pay for a firstclass plane ticket to ecuador 
authorities said 
he then agreed to get fake metrodade police reports to prove to 
the cocaine dealers that he had been arrested and their money 
seized 
iglesias told the informant he wanted to be paid with an 11000 
watch which the informant gave him on april 25 authorities said 
on may 2 iglesias was called by an agent in columbus ga and 
told the informant had been stopped in macon ga authorities 
said iglesias told mallarney the informant was working with him in 
an undercover operation

in a rejection of reforms that 
have changed much of the soviet bloc romanian and czechoslovak 
leaders on wednesday said each nations communist party should 
decide its own political course 
the statement by communist party leader milos jakes and romanian 
president nicolae ceausescu was issued by the official news agency 
ctk during ceausescus oneday visit to prague 
the new problems facing communism require the building of 
relations between parties on the basis of equality independence 
and the right of each party to work out its own political line 
without any external interference the statement said 
it signaled a rejection of reforms that have changed political 
life in poland hungary and the soviet union it closely followed a 
visit to prague by east german leader erich honecker who also has 
criticized political changes begun under soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
both czechoslovakia and romania have bad relations with their 
neighbor hungary and the statement emphasized that foreign 
communist parties should not interfere in domestic affairs 
there was no indication that jakes had raised human rights 
issues with ceausescu who runs the most repressive government in 
the east bloc 
the human rights group charter 77 wrote an open letter to jakes 
before the visit urging him to discuss romanias record which is 
increasingly attacked in the west and in hungary 
czechoslovakias ties with hungary have soured recently over 
budapests decision to halt work on a joint dam project and an 
unprecedented hungarian television interview with former communist 
party leader alexander dubcek 
prague officially protested to budapest over the decision to 
halt work on the nagymaros dam and power station on the danube 
river demanding that the project be completed 
czechoslovakia has invested 11 billion in constructing a 
nearly completed companion dam at gabcikovo 40 miles east of 
bratislava 
hungarianromanian relations are even more strained because of 
romanias treatment of the estimated 17 million ethnic hungarians 
who live on its territory 
in january 1988 hungary took the unprecedented step of breaking 
an agreement and refusing to send home romanian citizens who sought 
refuge in hungary an estimated 50000 people mostly ethnic 
hungarians who claim discrimination in romania have done so

kurt carlson who was severely beaten by the hijackers of twa 
flight 847 four years ago says the sentencing wednesday of 
mohammed ali hamadi makes him really glad theyre going to put 
that guy away 
a west german court in frankfurt convicted hamadi in the 
hijacking and the brutal beating and murder of navy diver robert 
stethem 23 of waldorf md then sentenced the 24yearold 
terrorist to life in prison 
flight 847 was seized on june 14 1985 after the boeing 727 
took off from athens for rome the plane flew twice to algiers and 
three times to beirut on the hijackers orders thirtynine 
americans were held hostage for 17 days 
hamadi received the maximum sentence under west german law but 
navy lt jg stuart dahl 35 of port hueneme calif who was 
traveling with stethem when the plane was hijacked said the 
terrorist deserved a sterner fate 
dahl told fargo nd radio station wday that hamadi should 
have been extradited to the united states to stand trial and should 
have been sentenced to death 
he deserved to be treated like a terrorist and die a 
terrorists death violently the thief river falls minn 
native said 
three san franciscans who were passengers on flight 847 said 
they feared that west germany would be pressured to release him 
we have very strong reason to believe that the west germans 
have made a deal for an early release or at least have led 
hamadis family and supporters in beirut to think so mauri 
schwartz told a news conference in san francisco attended by fellow 
passengers dino cucchi and his wife loretta 
reading a statement by the three ms schwartz said recent 
kidnappings and releases of west germans in lebanon appeared to be 
connected to hamadis case 
we are satisfied that this verdict and sentence are 
appropriate punishment for his crimes and for that we breathe a 
sigh of relief she said 
we ask the west german government to abide by the courts 
decision and keep hamadi in prison for the rest of his life we ask 
the us government to insist on this in every aspect of our 
foreign policy 
if he does get to go back he will do it again ms schwartz 
said speaking for herself 
a west german prosecutor peter korneck said hamadi will be 
eligible for parole review in 15 years defense attorneys said they 
expected to appeal the sentence 
like stethem carlson was singled out by the terrorists for 
especially brutal treatment the rockford ill businessman was 
returning from army reserve duty in the middle east and was 
carrying a government passport 
im really glad theyre going to put that guy away he said 
in a telephone interview wednesday from a college alumni outing at 
myrtle beach sc 
he really didnt seem to care if all of us died or not said 
carlson 42 he deserved the worst punishment there is for what 
he did not just to me but to robert stethem and all the passengers 
and the crew 
the rev james mcloughlin of geneva ill one of three priests 
leading illinois roman catholics who were returning from a 
pilgrimage to the holy land aboard flight 847 said he was glad the 
death penalty was not an option 
that would just continue the anger the chain reaction of 
retribution mcloughlin said 
this is kind of a period to the whole thing said evelyn 
balt 74 of oswego ill maybe now theyll let it die you think 
youve put it completely out of your mind and then something like 
this comes up and brings it all back again

a factfinders report wednesday urged 
striking teachers to end the 3dayold walkout that has crippled 
education for more than a halfmillion students in the nations 
secondlargest school district 
the report concluded the los angeles unified school districts 
offer will provide a teacher compensation package which is among 
the best in los angeles county the state of california and in the 
entire united states 
the teachers had contended the district was topheavy with 
administrators and concealing it financial reserves but the report 
concluded that the district spends less on administrators and 
wasnt hiding surplus funds 
the report said the district spends only 495 percent of its 
total expense on salaries for administrators the average in the 20 
largest unified school districts in california is 63 percent 
the report was prepared by lawyer geraldine randall who began 
investigating the dispute last march when the 16month contract 
negotiation reached an impasse 
she was selected jointly by the los angeles unified school 
district and the teachers union but wayne johnson president of 
united teacherlos angeles dismissed the conclusions saying the 
author was biased against teachers 
if they district officials stand firm the strike will 
continue he said 
school board president roberta weintraub said the totally 
exonerates the board of education and i urge each and every 
teacher to go back to work 
weintraub said 60000 copies of the report would be printed for 
the striking teachers she urged teachers to read the report and 
return to work 
on tuesday district spokeswoman diana munatones said the report 
would serve as a focal point for both sides to return to the 
bargaining table 
fact finders look at all the facts listen to the arguments of 
both parties and then basically come up with a recommended 
decision said dennis batchelder of the state public employment 
relations board in other words its advisory its not a binding 
decision 
weintraub and johnson have said money was the main issue holding 
up an agreement which neither expected before friday 
johnson said the number of striking teachers is growing along

more than 1 million jubilant people swarmed into 
central beijing on wednesday to shout their support for students 
who are fasting for democracy it was the largest show of defiance 
in communist chinas 40year history 
more than 75000 students took to the streets at least two dozen 
other cities a clear sign the prodemocracy movement has taken on 
a nationwide scope 
early thursday bannerwaving soldiers doctors workers and 
students clogged beijings main streets as they headed for 
tiananmen square where the students have been camped since 
saturday demanding a dialogue with the government but the marchers 
were far fewer than on wednesday 
communist party chief zhao ziyang and other senior officials 
visited students hospitalized in the 5dayold hunger strike for 
democracy an announcer on a studentrigged loudspeaker said zhao 
premier li peng and qiao shi who is in charge of party discipline 
made a 4 am visit to one hospital and student leaders said 
education minister li tieying visited another 
qiao was quoted as telling one weakened faster its best you 
go back to class 
doctors said at least 2000 students were taken to hospitals by 
early thursday many returned to the square after being revived 
the massive yet peaceful displays of grassroots unity put more 
pressure on the government to resolve an impasse with the 
studentled movement which has gained broadening support among the 
rest of the populace 
the catalyst for the demonstrations is the 3000 students who 
began staging the hunger strike saturday timing their protest to 
coincide with soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs historic trip 
to china 
delay means death read one of the hundreds of banners 
carried through tiananmen during the gigantic march which was 
dominated by workers rather than students for the first time since 
the prodemocracy rallies began april 15 
government and party officials met wednesday with two student 
representatives the students said later they were optimistic an 
agreement would be reached quickly on their demands which include 
a formal meeting with authorities broadcast live on television 
students early wednesday had rejected an appeal by zhao for an 
end to the strike although he promised concrete measures to 
advance democracy 
a deluge of letters and petitions demanding the goverment make 
concessions poured into government offices from professors 
artists youth groups and chinas normally silent noncommunist 
parties some members of parliament joined the protest 
astrophysicist fang lizhi who is chinas most famous dissident 
but has kept a low profile during the protests said in an 
interview with hong kong television that some leaders should step 
down he did not say who should resign but indicated he felt it 
should be premier li and senior leader deng xiaoping 
beijing residents on foot bicycle pedicab and bus flocked 
throughout the day to tiananmen the symoblic center of power in 
china to support the hunger striking students 
the protesters whose numbers included government employees and 
even soldiers filled the 100acre square and marched down the 
streets of central beijing chanting slogans and singing 
police did not try to stop the demonstration and even helped 
clear the streets for ambulances that shuttled weakened fasters to 
the citys hospitals every few minutes they also guarded shops 
against looting as the demonstration extended into the night 
the last time such huge crowds converged on tiananmen was during 
the radical leftist 196676 cultural revolution when frenzied red 
guards gathered to hear pronouncements from mao tsetung 
gorbachev who was in the great hall of the people next to 
tiananmen square for much of the day said in an interview on 
chinese television all these rallies made us nervous but 
added that his trip was going well 
he came to china to normalize ties after a 30year rift 
gorbachev told a news conference he spoke with some student 
leaders and received a warm letter from the students who 
support his reforms in the soviet union before flying to shanghai 
on thursday gorbachev urged a negotiated settlement of the crisis 
but did not take sides in the dispute he called it an internal 
matter 
demonstrations grew wednesday in shanghai where at least 70 
student hungerstrikers lay in front of city hall while nearly 
30000 students gathered to chant for the resignation of shanghai 
communist party chief jiang zemin an american witness said 
staterun xinhua news agency in an unusually frank report said 
marches were held tuesday and wednesday in more than 23 other 
cities including canton xian tianjin wuhan jinan and hefei 
nearly 30000 students paraded through the main streets of nanjing 
capital of coastal jiangsu province it added 
thousands also protested in lanzhou the capital of gansu 
province said an american witness who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
hong kong television identified other cities where 
demonstrations were held as fuzhou guiyang guilin qingdao 
xiamen huizhou harbin shenyang guizhou chengdu and chongqing 
the beijing march included factory workers high school 
students dancers farmers and at least 1000 soldiers some 
wearing yellowandgreen camouflage uniforms 
some marching postal workers said they were on strike and there 
were unconfirmed rumors of other walkouts although most laborers 
said they would be back on the job thursday 
protesters chanted slogans denouncing official profiteering and 
corruption and called for the resignation of li and deng li

a man upset over failing to gain admission to a 
graduate school program 14 years ago has been arrested for making 
more than 50000 harassing phone calls to a professor since then 
police said wednesday 
yoshikazu hayashi 39 a forestry office employee in western 
kyoto was arrested on charges of intimidation after he admitted

tsunahide shitei a former professor at kyoto university the 
official said shiteis wife yoshiko told the associated press 
her family received more than 100 calls each on saturdays and 
sundays 
in some calls hayashi made such remarks as ill set fire to 
your house or how could you stand my calls for 14 years 
police said 
asked why shitei did not change the phone number his wife said 
it would cause a lot of trouble because of his work as a professor 
she said the couple waited so long to call the police because they 
were reluctant to have hayashi arrested 
shitei 77 finally asked police to investigate in march 
in 1974 hayashi failed to gain admission to a graduate program 
of kyoto universitys agriculture department where shitei taught

a court dropped charges against 
americanborn rancher who has been linked to the nicaraugan rebel 
supply network one of his attorneys said wednesday 
john hull was jailed jan 13 on charges of drug trafficking and 
violating costa rican security he was freed in early march after 
he posted 37000 bail pending his trial 
while in jail the 69yearold hull had a heart attack and was 
hospitalized for three weeks 
defense attorney juan jose sobrado said the ruling by a superior 
penal court judge in alajuela just outside the capital annulled 
an earlier ruling by another court in san carlos about 100 miles 
to the north 
sobrado said the alajuela judge reportedly cited a lack of 
evidence when annulling the earlier san carlos ruling which 
ordered hull jailed the charges originally were filed in alajuela 
but the case was later moved to san carlos 
hull of evansville ind has lived in costa rica for 20 years 
and owns a ranch in san carlos his lawyers say he became a costa 
rican citizen eight years ago 
us congressional witnesses have said hulls ranch in costa 
rica was a transshipment point for guns headed to the rebels in 
nicaragua and cocaine destined for the united states 
hull has denied any role in the illegal drug trade and said his 
support of the contra rebels was a patriotic gesture 
another attorney for hull rita herrera said she had not 
received an official copy of the courts ruling as of late 
wedensday 
officially we dont know anything but we hope to have the 
official ruling tommorrow herrera said in a telephone interview 
court officials in alajuela could not be reached by telephone 
for comment late wednesday 
herrera said hulls case probably would be rejudged by the san 
carlos court 
it will start all over again she said but we are happy 
for what we have achieved up to now

foreign ministers of the organization of 
american states approved a resolution wednesday night to send 
mediators to panama in an effort to end that countrys political 
crisis through a transfer of power 
the resolution also held panamanian leader manuel antonio 
noriega responsible for the grave events and abuses in panama 
in recent days 
the mediators were ordered to report back by june 5 on their 
mission in order to determine whether any subsequent measures are 
appropriate to resolve panamas crisis 
the resolution asked the foreign ministers of ecuador guatemala 
and trinidad assisted by oas secretary general joao baena soares 
to undertake the mission in order to secure a national accord 
in panama within democratic mechanisms 
the accord is to be reached in the shortest period possible to 
ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign 
will of the panamanian people the resolution said 
the most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a 
direct reference to noriega was appropriate 
the initial draft resolution prepared by a 10nation 
delegation omitted all references to noriega but the united 
states and other countries strongly opposed to noriega reversed 
that omission during a closed session of more than two hours 
paving the way for final approval 
the new language warned that the grave events and abuses by 
noriega could unleash an escalation of violence in panama 
the decision to include the reference to noriega was approved by 
a 202 vote with seven delegates abstaining the panamanian and 
nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording 
nonetheless panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter after 
opposing the any change in the initial resolution said he was 
pleased with the overall result secretary of state james a baker 
iii also said he was pleased 
the delegates reassembled in public session after their private 
meeting late wednesday to give the resolution final approval but 
that was considered a mere formality 
the resolution was seen as a compromise between oas factions 
which had been advocating markedly different approaches to the 
panamanian crisis one faction had advocated a handsoff policy 
toward noriega citing oas principles of nonintervention and a 
hardline faction which had demanded the removal of noriega from 
power the united states was in the latter category 
critics of the resolution argued that the call for a transfer of 
power is largely meaningless because noriega himself backed the 
countrys recent election process 
but backers of the draft pointed out that the proposal calls for 
an end to the crisis through democratic procedures 
noriegas candidate in the may 7 election carlos duque claimed 
victory but the results subsequently were voided by the panamanian 
electoral tribunal after widespread allegations of voterigging 
there also were brutal attacks by government agents on several of 
the candidates in the election a point noted in the draft 
resolution 
noriega sees himself as no more than the defense force commander 
who serves at the pleasure of a president who is the product of a 
constitutional process the first test of the resolution is whether 
noriega demonstrates a willingness to cooperate with the mediators 
the proposal was presented by the delegations of bolivia 
brazil colombia costa rica ecuador jamaica peru dominican 
republic uruguay and venezuela 
at the capitol 57 members of the senate encouraged baker in a 
letter to press hard for oas action 
we urge the members of the oas to pass a resolution calling 
for the immediate replacement of the noriega regime and 
installation of a democratic government in panama which reflects 
the free will of the people of that country the letter said 
ritter argued in closed session that panamas problems are the 
product of a systematic campaign of us interventionism including 
a series of economic sanctions and what he says was a 10 million 
us government contribution to the opposition campaign 
as the meeting started the united states was aligned with the 
central american countries and some caribbean islands in calling 
for a strong stand against noriega 
at the other end of the spectrum mexico and brazil were 
believed to be encouraging a more cautious approach one that takes 
into account oas principles requiring respect for the sovereignty 
of member nations

the chief mate aboard the exxon valdez 
when it struck a reef in prince william sound and caused the 
nations worst oil spill told investigators wednesday he thought he 
would die in the accident 
i dont mind telling you that at the time i knew that my 
world would never be the same again said james r kunkel i 
never knew if id see my wife again 
his testimony led off the second day of a fiveday national 
transportation safety board hearing into the cause of the march 24 
accident in which 109 million gallons of north slope crude fouled 
more than 700 miles of shoreline 
the panel plans to question more than two dozen witnesses 
including coast guard personnel and exxon executives capt joseph 
hazelwood who is charged with operating a vessel while drunk will 
not testify he faces trial june 20 
the boards report on the cause of the accident will take up to 
a year to complete 
kunkel said he saw no sign that hazelwood had been drinking he 
said he talked to hazelwood shortly after the wreck and smelled no 
alcohol on his breath at that time the only scent in the air 
was crude oil vapors 
toxicologist mike peat however testified that hazelwoods 
bloodalcohol level may have been 22 percent at the time of the 
wreck the coast guard considers commercial vessel operators 
legally drunk when blood alcohol measures 04 percent 
peat an associate of the sacramento calif laboratory that 
processed the blood samples hazelwood produced for sobriety tests 
said the samples showed hazelwoods bloodalcohol reading was 0061 
assuming the captain did not drink alcohol from the time of the 
crash until the tests were administered about 11 hours later it 
can be estimated his bloodalcohol level was 22 when the wreck 
occurred peat said 
a heavy drinker might not show obvious signs of intoxication 
peat said yet still could suffer impaired judgment and vision with 
a bloodalcohol measurement of 22 
he also said alcohol dissipates in the blood of heavy drinkers 
faster than in the blood of moderate drinkers hazelwood has a 
history of alcohol abuse 
in testimony presented earlier wednesday coast guard lt cmdr 
thomas falkenstein said the smell of alcohol on the captains 
breath was obvious when he interviewed hazelwood on the bridge 
after the wreck 
falkenstein said he had not met hazelwood previously and could 
not judge whether he was intoxicated the captain was reluctant to 
submit to a urine test to detect alcohol consumption falkenstein 
said 
kunkel testified that when he told the captain about the huge 
loss of oil hazelwood replied well this is one way to end a 
career 
wednesdays questioning of kunkel focused on the crews 
activities aboard the tanker evidence the captain had been 
drinking crew fatigue and exxon policies 
kunkel said he sometimes worked 24 hours a day with little rest 
and considered the odd hours just part of the job and he suggested 
the long hours were not a serious problem youre talking to a 
person who is used to this he said this is normal for me 
kunkel described gregory cousins the third mate who was in 
charge of the vessel when it ran aground as a very competent 
young man who never complained of fatigue 
cousins was not certified to operate the tanker in prince 
william sound he said hazelwood had left the bridge to send 
messages from his office 
documents the ntsb has released suggest the accident could have 
been a lot worse the documents also detail drinking by the captain 
on shore before the tanker left port 
a jammed gauge led officers aboard the exxon valdez to believe 
the vessel remained stable and as a result hazelwood tried to rock 
the vessel free of the reef if the tanker had not been on the 
reef the vessel would have capsized and sunk with more than 39 
million gallons of oil still aboard one document said 
crew members and others who testified before the panel on 
tuesday said hazelwood smelled of alcohol but did not act drunk 
before the accident he failed sobriety tests about nine hours 
after the early morning wreck march 24 
according to the documents the ships radio officer joel 
roberson told investigators that he met hazelwood and the ships 
chief engineer jerzy glowacki on the afternoon of march 23 at a 
bar where they played darts and each bought one or more rounds of 
drinks 
he said hazelwood was drinking a clear beverage glowacki was 
drinking gin and tonic and he drank beer glowacki told 
investigators he had three gin and tonics but did not recall how 
much hazelwood had to drink 
glowacki said the three left the bar about 7 pm and went to a 
restaurant and ordered pizza glowacki and the radio officer agreed 
each of the three men had one alcoholic drink as they waited 
shortly after the accident hazelwood told an investigator he 
had a beer with lunch on march 23 a beer at the bar later in the 
day and a third beer at the restaurant he also said he drank two 
lowalcohol beers when he returned to the vessel

for 21 years texan vendyl jones has been 
using the dead sea scrolls like a treasure map to search 
surrounding desert caves for riches of the jewish temple buried by 
the ancient israelites 
among the lost artifacts jones hopes to recover are the ashes 
of the red heifer 
these according to the old testament numbers 19 were derived 
from burning a rare solidred cow and using the ashes for 
purification rites by the ancient israelite priests 
many orthodox jews and christian fundamentalists believe that 
finding the ashes would be a step toward fulfilling the biblical 
prophesy of rebuilding the jewish temple on the temple mount 
currently the site of the moslem holy shrines known as the dome of 
the rock and al aqsa 
the ashes are the future this will allow the establishment of 
the third temple said jones 58 a former southern baptist 
minister from arlington tex 
to me thats worth 10000 king tut tombs he said referring 
to the spectacular ancient egyptian treasure recovered in 1922 at 
luxor 
rabbi menachem burstein one of a small number of rabbis trained 
to use the ashes if they are recovered said the ancient relics 
would be used to purify jews so they could enter the temple mount 
without defiling it 
if its clear the ashes are authentic it can help us prepare 
for building the new temple he said for nearly 2000 years 
there havent been any ashes 
however any attempt to restore a jewish temple on the site 
would be certain to stir tensions throughout the moslem world 
the romans destroyed the second israelite temple in 70 ad a 
religious ruling has banned orthodox jews from visiting the temple 
mount so they would not walk on the site of the holy of holies 
without being purified 
according to the socalled copper scroll the ashes of the red 
heifer were buried in the first century ad along with other 
temple treasures by the mystical essenes sect who hid the dead sea 
scrolls in the same desert caves to avoid plundering by the 
advancing romans 
the copper scroll is one of the dead sea scrolls written by the 
ancient essenes and discovered in a cave in qumran in 1952 
among the temple treasures it says were buried with the ashes of 
the red heifer were gold silver the vestments of the high 
priests the balsam oil used to annoint the israelite kings and the 
original israelite tabernacle built by moses and aaron 
by carefully deciphering the document etched in hebrew on three 
pieces of copper measuring nearly eight feet in length jones 
believes he has been able to locate the cave where the temple 
treasures are buried 
the scroll is filled with descriptions its like following a 
treasure map said jones who began his quest in 1968 
the scroll says that on the way from jericho to the biblical 
town of secacah in the wadi of the dome there lies a cave 
with two openings separated by a large column said jones who 
studied judaism at an ultraorthodox seminary in jerusalem it 
says this is the cave where the treasures are buried 
but locating the cave among the thousands that dot qumran was a 
formidable task jones walked for miles guided by aerial 
photographs before he finally found a domeshaped hill rising above 
a wadi or dry riverbed 
several hundred meters yards to the east was a cave with two 
mouths separated by a rock column 
jones and his son wain began excavating the cave in 1977 
despite arguments from archaeologists that previous digs showed it 
was uninhabited within a few months 30 buckets full of pottery and 
other artifacts were unearthed 
when i started working on this cave all the archaeologists 
here thought it was a joke they said the bedouin had already 
carted off anything that might have been here i heard all their 
hohums i ignored them and i went on jones said 
subsequent excavations yielded tools and woven mats from the 
stone age pottery and a 4000yearold altar and the remains of a 
first century clay stove and a basket of peanuts left by the 
essenes 
the finds prompted jones to set up the arlingtonbased institute 
of judaicchristian research which has funded excavation and sent 
some 350 american volunteers since 1977 the expedition has the 
backing of some prominent orthodox jews 
jones who quotes scripture as saying the ashes will be found by 
nonjews says evidence found in the cave matches descriptions in 
the scroll these include a large white stone blackened by burning 
lamp oil and a shaft of blue light caused by sunshine filtering 
onto the caves floor through a hole in its ceiling

pope john paul ii and the archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie leader of world anglicanism have traded 
some more arguments about ordaining women 
letters between the two prelates were released at a meeting here 
of the primates of anglican branches in 27 nations 
runcie had written the pope urging study of the ordination 
issue on an ecumenical basis saying it hasnt even been tried and 
expressing hope it would be carried out with trust and mutual 
respect 
the pope said ordination of women in some parts of anglicanismn 
seems to effectively block mutual recognition of ministries 
since roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy are firmly 
opposed to it 
however the pope emphasized the strong bond of communion by 
which we are already united and their mutual commitment to 
increasing that bond

actorsinger kenny rogers believes hes found 
a theme in the song about cowboys in space planet texas that 
will become as fruitful as his songturnedmovie the gambler 
his 600000 video of planet texas a hightech western 
will have its debut on his nbc special saturday the special was 
taped at a concert with dolly parton and willie nelson at the 
johnson space center in houston its called kenny dolly and 
willie something inside so strong 
the song written by john andrew parks iii is also the lead 
tune on rogers new album something inside so strong the 
video which is loaded with special effects was directed by julien 
temple who directed the current movie earth girls are easy 
the gambler an earlier rogers hit song was expanded into 
three highly successful television movies 
its the most unique piece of music ive heard in 20 years 
rogers said of planet texas it may be a new genre it has to 
do with space and time travel but its also a western these alien 
cowboys pick me up and take me to a planet called texas 
we may do this as a movie for nbc but were also toying with 
the idea of trying to attract a steven spielberg or george lucas 
and making it a feature film its such an unusual concept and 
offers the same limitless possibilities that the gambler did 
its easy to find projects said rogers its hard to find 
projects that allow you do things that are unique and have no 
comparisons if i do any kind of acting my acting is questioned 
im not an actor if i do something unique people get caught up in 
it and are less apt to scrutinize my work 
this is uncharted territory theres nothing to compare it to 
my own philosophy has been that if you give us a little success 
well make it a big deal we did that with lucille and we did it 
with the gambler this can be a whole new career move 
he said planet texas was brought to his attention after 
parks was turned down for a record contract by capitol records 
i was offered this terrific song and recorded it he said 
then capitol signed parks to a contract the only bad news is 
that he has his own album coming out and i wont get his new songs 
this kid can sing but it worked out good for him he never could 
have gotten a 600000 video done 
rogers had just flown to los angeles that morning from his 
1200acre farm near athens ga he talked about the special before 
going to nbc for an appearance on the tonight show afterward 
he planned to give a concert at a private party in palm desert 
then fly back to georgia 
he and his wife marianne and his son christopher 7 moved to 
the farm two years ago but with his own private jet he makes 
regular jaunts for concerts commercials movies charity 
appearances and to look after his many investments hes building 
his own 18hole golf course on the farm 
i may sell the whole thing he said im basically a 
builder the fun is creating it not living in it ive overbuilt 
every house ive had it keeps me creatively busy 
plans for rogers syndicated talk show have been pushed back to 
1990 his manager ken kragen believes that by then viewer and 
advertiser rebellion against socalled trash television will 
open up a market for lateafternoon shows 
rogers has also signed a new twoyear contract to do commercials 
for dole which also feature his wife and young son some of the 
commercials were filmed on the island of lanai in hawaii which is 
owned by dole rogers is building a new home on the island 
an older son kenny rogers jr is also a singer and a host on 
the channel one program that is shown in schools

its the bizarre lawsuits that get the 
attention the man who sued the subway for his injuries in a 
suicide attempt the woman who claimed damages from a bourbonmaker 
saying the whiskey she drank caused birth defects the bridetobe 
who collected from an amusement park for injuries suffered when her 
fiance banged his bumper car into hers 
but the impact of a costly and often capricious liability system 
goes far deeper critics call it to a liability lottery business 
leaders warn that it is a brake on the economy and it puts us 
firms at a disadvantage in world markets 
the committee for economic development an organization of 
business leaders and educators says high insurance costs 
increasing legal fees and court judgments are only a fraction of 
the real cost of the liability system it argues the system 
produces higher prices keeps goods and services from the consumer 
and discourages innovation 
it seems almost everybody sues for almost anything these days 
business would like to see changes in the liability system a 
system that has moved gradually away from one in which the 
plaintiff had to prove negligence or fault to recover now some 
argue it is one of strict liability against product manufacturers 
doctors accountants lawyers even clergymen 
one objective of the system is supposed to be to deter injuries 
by making the party responsible pay sometimes heavily the 
advocates of change say that isnt working 
they say imposing liability against defendants who have taken 
reasonable precautions can undermine the incentive for all 
manufacturers to be careful if theyre going to lose anyway extra 
care doesnt pay 
the safest way out is to withdraw a product or service that has 
been involved in a liability award one manufacturer decided not to 
market an asbestos substitute because of the risk of lawsuits the 
conference board a business group surveyed corporate chief 
executives and found nearly half of their firms had dropped 
products and nearly 40 percent had withheld new ones because of 
liability risks 
the ced is urging a uniform federal product liability standard 
to replace a system built around court decisions and widely varied 
state laws 
in a policy study it has just published that group urged a 
return to a system of liability based on some notion of fault or 
responsibility for harm it says punitive damages which often 
represent the big money in liability cases should be limited and 
ordered only in cases of willful misconduct 
businessmen seldom are fans of government regulation but the 
liability crisis has changed some attitudes compared with the 
lawsuits of the past decade or so the regulators are starting to 
look good 
as a result strengthened and binding health and safety 
regulation by the government is one of the cornerstones of the 
drive for an overhaul of the liability process 
wouldbe reformers want more extensive regulation for health and 
safety the tradeoff proposed in the ced study would be to have 
government regulatory approval supplant and preempt liability 
lawsuits 
that would apply only to design or labeling rules explicitly 
approved by regulatory agencies it wouldnt cover defective 
products or cases in which a manufacturer broke the rules to get 
regulatory approval 
so far efforts to replace the system with one of uniform 
federal rules have run into the potent opposition of trial lawyers 
consumer activists are wary of limits or restrictions on damages 
so change wont come easily 
but the ced study argues persuasively that its going to take 
some kind of reform to create a more rational process 
it cites the case of a drug for morning sickness later alleged 
to cause birth defects although there was no evidence of a link in 
scientific studies in 17 lawsuits the manufacturer won 12 the 
plaintiffs 5 a massachusetts judge dismissed one case for lack of 
evidence a district of columbia judge sent a similar case to a 
jury which awarded the plaintiff 20 million

graduation day at the nations schools and 
campuses over the next few weeks will mark a rite of financial 
passage for countless young people 
soon after the ceremonies are over many graduates will get 
their first taste of managing their own money full time as they 
embark on their adult lives 
it can be a big transition but it neednt be a traumatic one 
the students of the 1980s by all accounts are much more 
sophisticated about money matters than generations past 
furthermore the occasion comes for most people at a stage of 
life when they have energy and resiliency to spare and plenty of 
time to get some trialanderror experience with money management 
before they start making big commitments such as buying a home 
still there are many pitfalls to be avoided suppose for 
instance you plan to commute by car to a new job 
its important to take all the costs of that car into account 
monthly payments insurance and maintenance as well as gasoline 
if you want to make sure that most of your income doesnt get 
consumed by the cost of getting to and from your job 
a similar problem can arise with clothing many jobs naturally 
require that you look your best and the clothes you wore in school 
may not measure up to that standard 
but an allout splurge on a new wardrobe can mean that you have 
to work very hard just to pay for what you wear while youre 
working 
try starting off gradually with skirts or slacks from your 
current wardrobe and adding a basic suit and a jacket that will 
coordinate with these suggests the american financial services 
association a trade group representing financialservices firms 
some other tips suggested by the afsa 
like individual money managers of all ages you will need to 
handle credit cards and other borrowing with extreme care your 
capacity for debt may already be stretched by student loans that 
remain to be paid 
but that doesnt mean that you should necessarily avoid all 
credit offerings one or two judiciously chosen credit cards may 
help you establish a good credit history that might be useful later 
on 
many college graduates are sent credit applications when they 
graduate observes frances smith of the afsa 
if you think youll need access to credit early on it may a 
good idea to take advantage of one of these offers once you 
relocate and get a new job it may be more difficult initially for 
you to obtain credit 
learn to plan eating and entertainment expenses to get the 
most benefit at a reasonable cost 
brownbag lunches at work and dinner at home can save you a lot 
of money that might otherwise be spent eating out all the time 
try to keep your refrigerator and shelves stocked so that you 
wont be tempted to go out for meals too often the afsa advises 
another triedandtrue approach to keeping food bills down 
always aim to shop with a list of the items you need and 
preferably not when you are famished from a long day of work and 
exercise 
according to the howard marlboro group a new york firm that 
provides marketing information fewer than onethird of supermarket 
shoppers enter the store armed with a list 
and more than half of the sales racked up by supermarkets 
represent impulse sales unplanned purchases ranging heavily 
to items like magazines candy and gum greeting cards and snacks

when crops fail or markets plummet farmers 
often tighten their belts and seek help refinancing loans they 
also rely a little more on paychecks from jobs in town 
in three of the last 10 years net cash income from farming has 
shown yeartoyear declines but family earnings from outside jobs 
have moved steadily higher each year 
the agriculture department says 1989 will be no exception for 
offfarm income it will increase again while cash income from 
farming will decline for the third time since 1979 
by themselves the national statistics for the offfarm income 
of farm families are indicative of how dependent us agriculture 
has become on outside earnings 
for example according to usda historical figures and 
projections for this year offfarm earnings have exceeded annual 
net cash income from farming in half of the years since 1979 
this year could be a tossup department economists project net 
cash farm income the cash left over after paying cash expenses 
at 48 billion to 52 billion that would be down from the record 
of 58 billion in calendar 1988 
meanwhile 1989 offfarm income is projected at 48 billion to 
51 billion compared with a record 49 billion in 1988 
economists say the decline in net cash farm income will be due 
mostly to larger expenses because of more cropland being brought 
back into production and to a drop in federal payments 
offfarm jobs can be great insurance for farm families but usda 
sociologists timothy parker and leslie whitener say that sometimes 
there arent any close at hand 
some farmers will have trouble finding offfarm work because 
their individual characteristics make them weak competitors for 
good jobs or because the economic conditions of their local labor 
market limit their employment and wage opportunities or both 
they said in a report 
while the effects of the farm crunch of the 1980s has eased in 
recent years the longterm trends in farm consolidation and 
technology point to continued declines in farm numbers and family 
operators 
the number of farms dropped to fewer than 22 million last year 
from 59 million in 1945 according to the bureau of labor 
statistics an additional 300000 farms will disappear by the 
year 2000 many of those families will seek other livelihoods 
parker and whitener writing in the current issue of rdp a 
rural development magazine published by the departments economic 
research service said that as economic pressure continues many 
farmers will be forced to rely more heavily on nonfarm earnings 
the 1982 census of agriculture showed that more than half of the 
nations farmers did some offfarm work that year and that 
twothirds of those who worked held jobs for 200 or more days 
for some farmers supplemental offfarm earnings make it 
possible to have an adequate standard of living the report said 
for others it keeps them from losing their farm 
although the situation varies regionally across the nation 
parker and whitener said farmers as a group have a couple of 
strikes against them when seeking outside incomes age and 
education 
using 1980 census figures they found that 41 percent of the 
nations farmers were between the ages of 45 and 64 and another 23 
percent were over 65 that left only 36 percent younger than 45 
by contrast more than 70 percent of the total us labor force 
was under 45 years of age 
education is another factor the report said of farmers age 25 
to 64 years 67 percent completed high school compared with 76 
percent for the us labor force 
in another study usda economists nora l brooks and donn a 
reimund found that offfarm income is a permanent significant 
component of total income for many farm households 
in 1986 they said half of all farm households depended mainly 
on offfarm income for family living expenses while twofifths 
depended primarily on farm income less than a tenth depended on 
both farm and offfarm income 
although previously considered by many observers and analysts 
as a transitional step to fulltime farming offfarm employment is 
becoming more widely viewed as a choice by farmers to pursue dual 
careers brooks and reimund said 
on a strictly cash basis net cash income plus offfarm income 
the average income of farm households has consistently been 
higher than the average income of all us households during the 
1980s brooks and reimund reported but when certain noncash 
expenses are taken into account mainly depreciation the 
comparisons are mixed 
for example after adjusting for depreciation and other factors 
the economists found that the annual household income of farmers 
was 95 percent of the us average in 1970 and 1971 however from 
1972 through 1976 the boom years when exports surged and 
commodity prices were up annual household income of farmers 
exceed the us average 
in 1977 the ratio dropped to 92 percent rose back to 101 
percent of the us average in 1978 then fizzled for six straight 
years 1979 through 1984 the low mark was in 1981 when the average 
income of farm families was only 76 percent of the national average 
the ratio climbed to 101 percent in 1985 and to 111 percent in 
1986 the most recent year tabulated in the research

if pat beaver has trouble at her motel in 
this squaremile outpost along the colorado river the local police 
department refuses to respond she has to call nearby indian tribal 
authorities 
when luana miller rousts a disorderly drunk from her red pony 
saloon down the street she has to know the ancestry of the 
scoundrel before she knows which police department to call 
its a pretty volatile situation in my business she 
grumbles 
these days nobodys sure who runs parker the townspeople or 
the neighboring colorado river indian tribes two police 
departments patrol the town some stores collect sales tax some 
dont some restaurants receive health inspections some dont 
the town of 2800 is surrounded by the independent sovereign 
indian reservation and about onethird of the lots in town 
including ms beavers kofa inn are also on reservation land 
in fact a federal judge recently ruled at the behest of the 
indians that parker was indian country and part of the 
reservation 
now the tribes which share a 47 percent unemployment rate and 
are eager for aggressive economic development want a say in town 
government 
townspeople are furious 
people bought this land in town thought they were buying a 
part of the united states and they think they are part of the 
united states but thats what the judge ruled they arent 
said parker mayor sam davis 
the clash of cultures has been anything but peaceful over the 
years and both sides say it has held back economic development 
after parker police fatally shot two indians in separate 1987 
incidents tribal police began following the city officers and the 
city police chief described the situation as explosive federal 
mediators helped defuse some of the tension 
the reservation made up of mohave chemehuevi navajo and hopi 
indians launched a boycott of davis hardware store in parker 
and in april the tribes bought some city land and opened their own 
hardware store its nearly twice the size of davis and customers 
indian and nonindian alike dont have to pay sales tax 
the hardwarestore land also went off the city tax roll and will 
become reservation tribal attorney william lavell said 
the indians say they dont want to take over the town all they 
want is more respect from townspeople 
we realize we have to work with the town in order to have 
peace in the community said lawanda laffoon one of three tribal 
representatives on a negotiating team trying to resolve the dispute 
we both realize neither one of us is going away 
but townspeople say the tribes are after their tax money and 
some say if the tribes take over government in parker many in the 
town will pack up and move 
its conceivable but not practical ms miller said 
people like me own two businesses and two houses in town you 
cant turn tail and run my whole life is here 
the town has spent so much fighting the legal case that lawyers 
fees at one time amounted to 10 percent of the annual budget 
while other areas along the colorado river between california 
and arizona have boomed with tourism developments parker has been 
left behind 
i think that the dispute has hurt us all on both sides and we 
would like to get out of that mode so to speak and get on to 
development said roberta hoffman a town council member and 
representative to the negotiating team 
the 180000acre reservation that straddles the river was 
established in 1865 the town was founded six years later outside 
the reservation boundaries 
confusion about the lands took root in 1908 when congress 
approved moving the town onto reservation land so it would be near 
the new railroad 
a 1squaremile area was carved up and sold by the government 
which holds reservation lands in trust onethird of the land 
however remained unsold and was returned to the tribes 
the town and the tribe lived peacefully together for decades 
but trouble began amid a local economic depression caused by a 1983 
flood 
that year the tribes filed suit asking that indian authorities 
be given jurisdiction over zoning on the onethird of the town that 
was indian land and that the town be barred from denying utilities 
to those indian lots 
before long the suit was seen as a threat to the towns 
independence the key question was whether congress meant to 
disestablish the town from the reservation 
in february the town lost us district judge roger strand 
ruled congress didnt separate parker and the town was part of the 
reservation 
whatever happened its over ms hoffman said the 
comment i am getting around town is lets sit down talk and get 
down to business lets get on with it and lets get it settled 
i suppose we do have a choice to continue fighting the 
tribe she said but i dont think its wise 
two others from each side join ms hoffman and ms laffoon who 
are childhood friends for discussions aimed at creating a series 
of joint governmental agreements on everything from taxation to 
policing to building codes 
law enforcement for example is so complicated that a slew of 
police phone numbers have to be posted by the phone in ms millers 
saloon 
town police can arrest only nonindian town residents tribal 
police can prosecute only misdemeanors committed by indians 
felonies by indians become the domain of federal police such as 
the fbi or bureau of indian affairs deputies 
now if crimes are committed on indian land within the town 
only tribal police respond 
some say the town is realizing that there are economic benefits 
to be reaped by being part of an indian reservation which is 
eligible for special tax breaks and extra federal funding the 
reservation is nearing completion of a new generating plant on the 
colorado which could offer lowcost electricity to new industry 
were going to save money in the long run said town manager 
george kruse attitudes are changing were moving in the right 
direction now the lawsuit was the catalyst and the judges 
ruling was the reality 
but others like mayor davis said the only permanent solution 
would have to come from washington 
congress should finish doing what it didnt do in 1908 if it 
didnt disestablish the town then it should do it now he said 
so much bitterness has built up that the town and the tribe will 
never learn to get along davis said 
it never will be resolved the mayor said you and i and 
our kids wont live to see it resolved 
ive seen a time here in town when they needed something and 
wed do it wed need something and theyd do it 
now davis said its all screwed up where no one of us 
can get along

martin short insists that his hbo special 
i martin short goes hollywood is actually a salute to 
tinseltown not a sendup 
but perhaps thats fatuous entertainer jackie rogers jr talking 
in the show short insists it is a celebration of hollywood 
done with style and class and proving once and for all that you can 
do art in this town 
oh but that sounds so very much like something earnest ed 
grimley would say 
hollywood is fun said short as himself not as either of 
his many alter egos its great fodder for satire goodness 
knows people are obsessed with it if someone had told me 10 years 
ago there would be a nightly newscast devoted entirely to 
entertainment i wouldnt have believed it 
the audience has become very sophisticated my motherinlaw 
will call from toronto and tell me the box office grosses of my 
latest picture people in the midwest will get the inside jokes in 
this special 
the onehour special premieres saturday short is joined by 
christopher guest and tracey ullman and shorts former sctv 
colleagues joe flaherty catherine ohara and dave thomas 
when i do these shows i put a lot of time and energy into 
them short said its not a cakewalk i have to find the time 
like my work for sctv and saturday night live i tend to 
overwrite and strain the budget 
id just finished a picture and was wrapping up my saturday 
morning animated series the completely mental misadventures of ed 
grimley id work on the script for the special for a while then 
put it away id kept a loose thread to it at all times 
in the special short plays songanddance man dale oday 
struggling actor lawrence orbach gossip columnist tony soren 
insufferable albino singer jackie rogers jr and of course the 
tensely optimistic ed grimley 
the skit as the gossip columnist was completely improvised with 
guest 
short said jackie rogers jr a character he developed on 
sctv as one of the gushing guests on the sammy maudlin 
show is a grotesque character who symbolizes everything thats 
bad about show business when he tries to be deep hes merely 
pompous you want somebody to punch him in the head or throw a pie 
in his face 
ed grimley was originated onstage at second city hes a 
conglomeration of people ive known short said ed maintains 
himself with a spirit of enthusiasm he runs a gamut of emotions in 
five minutes hes like a guy smelling the roses after a heart 
attack except he hasnt had a heart attack 
short whose latest movie is three fugitives has a film 
development deal with disney studios 
its hard to find something thats good and something that you 
havent done he said im also looking at a broadway musical 
the ideal career for me would be able to do a tv special a movie 
and a play every year when i was an actor in canada you didnt do 
just one medium you did everything and it broadened you 
short moved his home from toronto to los angeles last year i 
always had a home here and a home in toronto he said weve 
got two children and two years ago we were flying back for 
christmas and the kids were screaming i thought why are we doing 
this for our value system if youre not from la it can be very 
healthy to live elsewhere this is the war zone and you go home to 
rest but the reality is i no longer felt it was necessary to go 
home 
hes married to nancy dolman who was gilda radners understudy 
when short and radner were doing godspell 
short was born in hamilton ontario where he said he grew up 
watching lucille ball dick van dyke and jackie gleason 
those were the three big influences when i was young he 
said i was fascinated by the way gleason could play ralph 
kramden and be so real it always amazed me how far you could 
go within the reality a character without any reality is pretty 
dull

finally theres a little car with an automatic transmission 
thats peppy yet doesnt struggle even on tough inclines 
this gutsy competitor the 1989 subaru justy gl ecvt is the 
only car in the country with a newfangled continuously variable 
transmission that doesnt shift 
instead the transmissions powerflow is smooth and continuous 
and is designed to offer the fuel economy of a manual transmission 
and the ease of operation of an automatic 
the pricetag is under 8000 thats noteworthy when you 
consider that many major innovations usually show up first on 
upscale luxury cars that most buyers cant afford 
subaru decided last year not to follow the pack and introduced 
the justy gl ecvt for the 1989 model year after years of research 
and nearly two years of ecvt sales in japan 
the continuously variable transmission concept actually is about 
100 years old but subaru combined the idea with computer controls 
in its lightweight runabout the justy and was the first to bring 
such a transmission to america ford and fiat have cvts in europe 
basically the justys transmission operates through a pair of 
pulleys and a metal belt that smoothly transfers power from one 
pulley to another the transmission automatically and constantly 
adjusts its ratios to match engine revolutions and load to how fast 
the car is going 
theres no hunting for the appropriate gear in this car even in 
steep climbs 
the transmission workings are in an oil bath for cooler 
operation and longer life subaru says adding that the ecvt has 
fewer moving parts than conventional transmissions so theyre 
easier to make and repair the driver will notice none of these 
things all he or she has to do is put the gear lever in drive and 
press on the accelerator 
the justy test car with its little threecylinder engine ran 
smoothly as promised save for one cold 32degree morning when i 
felt one jerk as i tried to drive away from a cold start 
the fuel economy was decent too about 34 miles per gallon in 
rugged pedaltothemetal cityhighway driving thats the same 
as the 34 mpg rating for city driving in a fivespeed manual 
transmission justy where you have to shift 
as expected in a subcompact the justy test car offered easy 
maneuverability in and out of parking spaces but theres no power 
steering so it can take some effort to turn the wheels while at a 
standstill 
i also noticed a bit of torque steer when i pushed the 
accelerator all the way down during a right turn seating is for 
four and the nicely upholstered front seats felt fine the rear 
seat was stiff and benchlike though and there wasnt a lot of 
headroom for tall folks 
as expected in a subcompact legroom could be tight if the front 
seats were pushed all the way back the interior was plain with 
screws showing where the speakers were placed at the end of each 
side of the dashboard still fit and finish was admirable and 
there were no squeaks or creaks 
the justy had been a novel car from its start in 1987 its the 
only subcompact that has a fourwheeldrive version for 1989 
subaru added the twowheeldrive gl ecvt version and put in more 
passenger and luggage room to all justy models by lengthening them 
6 inches and adding another inch to the height larger tires and 
front brakes on the gl and rs models were other changes for 1989 
americans seem to have taken to both the two and 
fourwheeldrive justy models with combined sales rising from 
13240 in calendar 1987 to 29865 last year for the first four 
months of 1989 another 9342 including 3213 ecvt models were 
sold so the pace is about even with last year 
steve davis national manager of product relations at subaru 
said the companys goal is for 3000 ecvt sales per month in 
april 1044 were sold he said adding that good quantities of the 
ecvt were not available at dealerships until after january 
davis said the justy is especially popular with women they are 
59 percent of the buyers of the twowheeldrive justy and 51 
percent of the buyers of the fourwheeldrive justy buyers median 
age is between 31 and 34 and more than 72 percent have college 
education davis said 
median household income ranges from 25400 for buyers of the 
twowheeldrive justy to 32000 for buyers of the fourwheeldrive 
version 
a major competitor is the ford festiva which looks similar to 
the justy on the outside and starts at about 7000 for a twodoor 
hatchback with automatic transmission because the ecvt model is 
new for this model year consumer reports magazine does not have an 
owners trouble report

lynne sharon schwartz has a lazy right eye 
with both eyes open her vision is normal but when she closes her 
left eye objects seem to break up becoming a collection of 
particles rather than a solid mass 
in a recent interview at her manhattan apartment schwartz the 
author of rough strife and disturbances in the field 
motioned to a couch and explained that the eye enabled her to see 
around it 
she gives the same condition to the character audrey her alter 
ego and the narrator of leaving brooklyn 1595 houghton 
mifflin 
it became a metaphor for seeing the reality behind the veil 
the surface schwartz said its wonderful for an adolescent 
the people around this girl are trying to present the world as safe 
and happy and decent she wants to know about all these ugly things 
and everybody is trying to conceal them 
author david shields like w somerset maugham and john updike 
is a stutterer a native of california he acquired a large 
vocabulary by learning as many as synonyms as possible for words 
that gave him difficulty 
dead languages 1895 knopf his second novel traces the 
childhood of jeremy zorn a stutterer growing up in los angeles and 
san francisco in the 1960s and 70s 
much of the burden of the book is trying to show how everyone 
has their own stutter shields said whether theyre the victim 
of political sloganeering or whether they fail to communicate 
their essence or whether they hide behind academic jargon 
schwartz and shields are among the many writers who have used 
their physical afflictions in a literary way 
rudyard kipling suffered from failing eyesight and made dick 
heldar go blind in the light that failed 
the southern author flannery oconnor contracted lupus a 
crippling disease that eventually killed her her short story 
good country people centers on a teenage girl with an 
artificial leg 
carson mccullers also a southern writer was in ill health 
most of her life the victim of several strokes the ballad of 
the sad cafe features the crosseyed miss amelia and a hunchback 
named lymon willis 
maugham transformed his stuttering to philip careys club foot 
in of human bondage 
in the preface to a collection of fyodor dostoevskys short 
novels thomas mann linked the russian authors greatness to his 
epileptic seizures 
i am filled with awe mann wrote with a profound mystic 
silenceenjoining awe in the presence of genius of disease and the 
disease of genius of the type of the afflicted and the possessed in 
whom saint and criminal are one 
mann cited the nihilistic kirilov in the possessed as an 
extension of the feelings brought on to dostoevsky by epilepsy he 
insisted that certain attainments of the soul are impossible 
without disease and he wrote of the incomparable sense of 
rapture and inner enlightment that illness can cause but 
also of horrible depression and spiritual ruin 
both schwartz and shields drew heavily on their own lives like 
her character audrey schwartz grew up in brooklyn in the 1940s 
and used her eyesight to draw a contrast between her seemingly 
uneventful life and the horrors of the holocaust and atom bomb 
you get the idea of things being in dots that theyre not 
really together this translates into the world being unsafe 
dangerous which leads you to all sorts of modernist notions she 
said 
everything looks compact but actually the atoms are racing 
around each other philosophically and emotionally thats what 
happens to this kid things are not as solid or coherent as they 
seem 
shields had articulate parents and remembered his frustration at 
not being able to match their verbal skills i felt like my 
family was living in language while i was dying in it that is the 
key to the whole book i too wanted to be sort of a verbal star 
i think what it did was drive me to the written word 
audrey and jeremy must each confront the pain of being 
flawed damaged goods audreys parents are horrified by their 
daughters eye forcing her to wear contact lenses against her will 
this idea of perfection was very important in brooklyn 
schwartz said things should be right they should be perfect 
they didnt care what was inside you could have all sorts of moral 
and emotional flaws but they liked their children to look right 
the girls especially 
jeremys stuttering leads to humiliating attempts at acting and 
debating and creates tension with his girlfriends and parents 
shields writes of the twin impulses to be morally impeccable 
and squeaky clean 
its never been just a little glitch in my tongue but an 
entire stripe across my chest that seemed to be my signature of 
being human he said in an interview someone stuttering always 
seemed to me to be saying life wasnt perfect and i especially 
wasnt perfect 
things were flawed there was a kind of tragic scratch across 
everything 
much of dead languages has a humorous tone and the book 
gave shields the chance to express a healthier outlook on 
stuttering than he was capable of in his own life 
my own feelings about stuttering are relatively serious he 
said it seems to me that the fun and joy of writing is you get 
to reach a higher plane some larger human realm in the whole 
scheme of things stuttering is a minor thing i think jeremy 
learns that kind of 
while audrey and jeremy are each blessed with special insight 
their afflictions also create distance between themselves and other 
people schwartz noted that audreys vision interferes with her 
ability to connect emotionally 
she was aloof from her life her surroundings she wants to 
distance herself almost look with condescension on the people 
around her i wanted to show the ruthlessness and lack of awareness 
of a precocious adolescence the author said 
audrey is able to see a better life than the world of 
brooklyn and has little use for her parents everyday existence of 
card games and gossip schwartz attributed this to a lack of 
insight 
she sees these people as trite and silly looks at them like 
theyre wasting their time in brooklyn people also have lives and 
passions and conflicts they live one life is as good as another 
its her limitation she cant see that people of brooklyn have 
lives too 
jeremys sense of irony of detached amusement is so strong 
that even when his mother dies he is left numb by the condolence 
cards admitting that he wanted to feel famous feelings but 
couldnt get past difficulties in construction 
his real problem is that stuttering has driven him to a kind 
of obsessive take on everything shields said much of the book 
is a very delicate balance youre suppose to hear underneath that 
irony hes really in extreme pain 
shields referred to jeremy and stutterers in general as 
truthtellers 
everyone else hides their tension while stutterers manifest 
it everyone is unsure of themselves but stutterers have the 
stupidity to actually manifest it he said it makes me aware 
of how people hide behind language and a lot of communication 
contains lies

on a whim one day corn farmer ed dziuk 
stuck an ear of popcorn in a microwave oven what he saw amazed 
him the kernels burst into fluffy white flowers still attached to 
the cob 
a food fad was born 
everyone on the planet earth should experience this thing once 
because its exciting says eds brother al 
when ed and brother dave showed him the microwave marvel al 
says he had no doubt it would sell he was right 
microwave popcornonthecob is popping up in grocery stores 
gift shops and mailorder catalogs nationwide an offbeat option to 
the conventional varieties that consumers buy off the cob 
a threeminute spin on a microwave carousel transforms a plain 
yellow ear of the dziuks product into an ear of white fluffy 
popcorn while some kernels pop on the cob others fire off the ear 
before puffing up 
with all the gourmet and fancy popcorn now on the market do 
american consumers really need popcornonthecob 
the dziuks have no doubt 
the popcorn producers boast that this farmfresh corn grown in 
west texas has nothing artificial 
it stays fresher on the cob and its this years corn says 
dave who oversees marketing with the help of rip hawk a former 
world tagteam pro wrestling champ who joined the brothers in their 
venture 
who they ask could resist the fun of watching an ear of corn 
twirl on the carousel firing off kernels and turning itself into a 
snack 
not everyone however was as quick as hawk and the dziuks to 
catch onto the compelling points of popcorn on the cob 
in the two years since they launched texas microwave 
popcornonthecob they have learned that selling a food fad isnt 
easy 
you cant just come up with a great new product and have 
people grab it up says al 
he and his brothers sold three acres worth of popping corn in 
1987 in packages of two or three ears and a plastic bag for 
popping 
but efforts to enlarge the operation stalled until the group 
learned that getting on store shelves was next to impossible 
without enlisting the help of a food broker no matter how 
ingenious the product 
we really had to learn the food business which we knew 
nothing about says dave 
in 1988 they planted 56 acres of popcornable corn yielding 
about 15 million ears only to see thousands of ears sit unbought 
in their warehouse about 500000 ears remain unpackaged and an 
equal amount was removed from the cob to sell as plain pedestrian 
popcorn off the cob 
the fledgling operation got a break when hawk and the dziuks 
approached united supermarkets inc a lubbockbased grocery chain 
after seeing a demonstration of the product buyer max tipton 
called other employees out of their offices to watch the corn pop 
all agreed that their kids would be captivated by such a gimmick 
we felt like people would enjoy watching it and that kids 
would like it tipton says 
after united helped line up a food broker the ears of popcorn 
began gaining wider distribution last fall 
we went from zero to a pretty fair track record now says 
hawk 
last fall more than 19000 packages of texas microwave 
popcornonthecob were sold and more than 20000 have gone out 
the door so far this year 
tipton says the companys packages which sell for 179 at 
united stores are selling at an average rate for popcorn 
to prepare it for shipment the handharvested ears must be 
shucked and the ends trimmed with a radial saw before theyre 
enclosed in plastic bags each of which holds 610 ounces of corn 
texas microwave popcornonthecob now is distributed to 11 
states most in the southwest and midwest in addition to grocery 
stores and michaels craft stores in 10 states the product soon 
may be sold in some jc penney stores hawk says 
the retail price ranges from 179 to 3 per package 
with orders rolling in the popcorn makers are gearing up to 
package the remainder of their 1988 crop 
they also are getting bulk orders from competitors elsewhere who 
were left short of corn by last years midwest drought dave says 
a nebraska company is packaging 10000 ears of popcorn bought from 
texas microwave he says 
the group figured its product would be largely a holiday item 
but found that demand picked up this spring 
popcorn is a yearround thing nowadays dave says 
popcorn has become big business americans bought 807 million 
pounds of unpopped popcorn last year according to the 
chicagobased popcorn institute and gobbled 129 billion quarts of 
popped corn 
the united states consumes twothirds of the worlds popcorn 
and hawk and the dziuks werent alone in devising a corny new way 
to pop it 
wesley friesen of venice fla introduced corny bros popcorn 
on the cob it comes three ears to a package and sells for 395 
other companies sell their oncob corn as a novelty item packaged 
in oldfashioned mason jars 
with success popping the idea man of the dziuk operation al 
is planning more ingenious ways to offer popcornonthecob hes 
experimenting with colored corn in hues from blue to purple to red 
we dont want to become millionaires al says but we do 
think we have something here

political instability in japan and west germany 
may help account for the weakness of their currencies and the 
relative strength of the dollar some economists believe 
the dollar rose monday to its highest level against the west 
german mark since the end of 1986 and its highest level against the 
japanese yen since november 1987 it edged back on tuesday 
market sentiment is the main cause of the dollars rise and if 
psychology changes the currency could drop as quickly as it shot 
up 
some analysts say the dollars rise has little to do with 
politics if the dollar was falling people would come up with a 
reason why that was happening said shafiqul islam senior fellow 
for finance at the council on foreign relations in new york 
but the more common view is that political factors are giving 
the dollar an artificial and probably temporary boost an opinion 
held by david hale chief economist for kemper financial services 
inc in chicago 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita and his liberal 
democratic party have been crippled by a spreading influencebuying 
scandal 
takeshita remains in office in spite of singledigit approval 
ratings because attempts to find a successor have been 
unsuccessful the ruling party is trying to gain public support in 
time for elections in july for the upper house of the parliament 
meanwhile in west germany the christian democratic union of 
chancellor helmut kohl has been trailing the opposition social 
democrats since the first of the year in nationwide polls 
kohl shuffled his cabinet last month in a step that the social 
democrats derided as kohls last stand some observers believe 
kohl could lose office if the allied free democrats pull out of the 
ruling coalition 
investors in stocks and bonds in a foreign currency tend to 
require a risk premium when theres a situation unfolding thats 
unsettling and raises question about economic policy said 
william sterling manager of international economics for merrill 
lynch amp co 
there are other reasons for the dollars rise including 
relatively high interest rates in the united states that make 
dollardenominated investments more attracive 
currency traders typically follow the dictum that the trend is 
your friend and as long as the dollar seems to be on an upward 
trend dealers figure they can make more money by buying it than by 
selling it 
ordinarily the bank of japan would raise japanese interest rates 
to pull the yen out of its slide but the central bank is reluctant 
to do that because it could hurt the price of bonds and stocks 
particularly shares in nippon telegraph and telephone corp that 
have already lost about half of their value 
unlike the rigorously independent federal reserve japans 
central bank is tied to the ministry of finance which is in charge 
of floating ntt shares and moreover has been sullied in the 
influencepeddling scandal 
the situation in west germany is somewhat different since the 
central bank is independent and freely raises rates when necessary 
to stem inflation in fact base rates have been raised three times 
since last fall 
but the political instability in west germany could be driving 
investors to change their marks into dollars and invest them in the 
united states said mieczyslaw karczmar a new yorkbased adviser 
to deutsche bank of west germany 
the issue of a stable political climate and safety is terribly 
important karczmar said capital for obvious reasons seeks 
safety and stability 
the united states has a huge trade deficit but for now 
investors are choosing to ignore it focusing instead on issues 
such as attractive us interest rates and the nations political 
stability 
aside from politics many traders believe that treasury 
secretary james a baker iii and other us officials do not mind a 
rise in the dollar now in spite of public commitments to stabilize 
its value

the nations top 500 service companies provided 
the allpurpose sweating for an industrial boom and posted 
aggregate profits of 738 billion last year a fortune magazine 
survey says 
fortunes survey of nonindustrial companies said a sharp 
resurgence in commercial banking also helped lift profits at the 
nations largest service companies by 55 percent over 1987 
by contrast the annual fortune 500 survey of leading industrial 
companies released last month showed a 27 percent rise in profits 
to 115 billion among those companies 
the report released tuesday for publication in the magazines 
upcoming june 5 issue marked a rebound for service companies from 
the year before when the stock market crash and earnings problems 
among unstable savings institutions contributed to a 22 percent 
drop to 508 billion in the service 500s profits 
fortune said the resurgence in the service sector was tied to 
the nations industrial boom which required service company help 
for shipping sales and the allpurpose sweating to make it 
work 
fortunes 34th annual service 500 survey indicated that a 
turnaround by the nations 100 largest commercial banks accounted 
for most of the gain the banks reported 175 billion in profits 
in 1988 compared with a 53 billion loss the year before 
transportation companies diversified services savings 
institutions and retailers on the list also showed strong gains 
the only decline was posted by the nations utilities whose 
profits fell 5 percent to 216 billion fortune attributed the 
drop to nuclear power plant problems at several companies 
including long island lighting co which registered more than 1 
billion in losses partly because of its idle shoreham nuclear plant 
the top 50 transportation companies showed an aggregate 50 
percent profit increase to 548 billion as airlines pulled in 
higher fares and railroads hauled high tonnage to keep pace with 
factories production and export needs fortune stated 
retailers the only bright spot in 1987 with a 16 percent profit 
hike registered a 10 percent gain last year to 912 billion 
fortune said service industry exports exceeded imports by 78 
billion in 1988 with a total of 70 billion in service exports 
last year 
the companies in the service survey like fortune 500 industrial 
corporations were ranked by sales 
american telephone amp telegraph co became the biggest 
diversified services company with 352 billion in sales 
displacing super valu stores a wholesale food distributor atampt 
moved to the service 500 from the fortune 500 in 1988 because it 
brought in more money from providing telephone service than from 
manufacturing products like computers and telecommunications 
equipment 
behind atampt were fleming cos a wholesale foods distributor 
super valu and mckesson corp which is involved in wine and 
spirits chemicals drugs and health care distribution and services 
citicorp chase manhattan corp and bankamerica corp remained 
the top three commercial banking companies 
the top diversified financial companies held their places 
american express co was largest followed by federal national 
mortgage association salomon inc aetna life and casualty and 
merrill lynch amp co 
among savings institutions hf ahmanson amp co was first 
followed by great western financial corp and calfed inc last 
years leader financial corp of america dropped from the list 
after robert bass acquired the companys troubled american savings 
subsidiary 
top retailers were sears roebuck and co and k mart followed by 
walmart stores inc which jumped from fifth the previous year 
united parcel service swapped places with ual parent of united 
airlines as the top transportation company followed by amr 
parent of american airlines csx corp and texas air corp the 
parent of eastern and continental airlines which fell from third 
place in 1987 
gte corp bellsouth corp and nynex corp remained the biggest

minorco sas attempt to create the worlds 
largest gold producer through a hostile takeover of consolidated 
gold fields plc finally unraveled after months of wrangling before 
us judges and british market officials 
a federal judge in manhattan refused on tuesday to lift his 
order blocking south africacontrolled minorco from acquiring gold 
fields before a 59 billion takeover bid was to expire 
that minorco has only until tomorrow to appeal this decision 
is regrettable wrote us district judge michael b mukasey who 
first imposed the injunction last october on antitrust grounds 
after mukasey refused to stay his order pending appeal minorco 
chief executive sir michael edwardes said the luxembourgbased 
company the largest gold producer in the noncommunist world would 
allow the wednesday deadline to lapse 
rudolph agnew chief executive of gold fields the 
secondlargest gold producer said he was highly delighted with 
the result of the battle calling it a tremendous victory 
last fall minorco which is largely controlled by two south 
african corporations anglo american corp of south africa and de 
beers consolidated mines ltd launched a hostile takeover bid for 
gold fields minorco already held almost 30 percent of gold fields 
shares 
gold fields and its us subsidiary newmont mining corp the 
largest gold producer in the united states sued in new york to 
block the takeover 
mukasey halted the takeover bid saying the combined entities 
would control 323 percent of the noncommunist worlds gold market 
on tuesday the judge said minorco had ample time to appeal his 
earlier rulings but for its own reasons and aware of the 
onrushing dealine minorco chose not to do so 
it should not now complain of unfair prejudice because it 
chose voluntarily a strategy which now leaves little time to 
appeal he wrote 
minorco owns or has tenders for about 55 percent of gold fields 
shares but mukaseys injunction bars minorco from buying shares it 
doesnt own the company said it would keep its position under 
close review 
britains panel on takeovers and mergers ordered gold fields to 
drop out of the us lawsuit unless it obtained shareholder 
approval gold fields voluntarily dropped out a week ago leaving 
newmont as the only obstacle to the takeover gold fields owns 49 
percent of newmont 
unless minorco could get newmont to withdraw its lawsuit the 
bid was to expire wednesday under british regulations 
in its last attempt to have the injunction lifted minorco 
claimed newmont lacked standing to continue the suit because it 
told the british takeovers panel it was a us concern not 
controlled by gold fields 
minorco lawyers claimed that if newmont was not controlled by 
gold fields it could not allege antitrust injury 
newmont originally claimed that because its us operations were 
more efficient than minorcos south african mines minorco 
eventually would shut down us operations if the takeover were 
accomplished 
in upholding mukaseys earlier rulings a federal appeals court 
said last month that newmonts threatened injury is precisely the 
type that the antitrust laws were designed to protect against 
mukasey wrote that the premise of minorcos argument was 
incorrect 
newmont could suffer antitrust injury in the form of 
reduced control over pricing and output as an independent 
competitor if the takeover succeeded and minorco controlled a 
greater share of the world noncommunist gold market he wrote 
he added that newmont has standing as an independent 
competitor to allege that the resulting combination of gold fields 
and minorco would substantially lessen competition and injure it

martin sorrell the wpp group plc boss who is 
closing in on his second record advertising buyout in three years 
makes the assembly of a worldclass advertising and marketing 
services empire look easy 
the ogilvy group inc gave in late monday to wpps 864 million 
takeover bid less than three weeks after sorrell first proposed a 
buyout to a company whose leaders admit they preferred independence 
it appears he may have learned some valuable lessons since his 
much rockier pursuit of another american advertising giant jwt 
group inc for what was then a record price of 566 million in 
1987 
in getting the ogilvy board to agree to the buyout quickly 
securities analysts say sorrell may have avoided offending clients 
who tend to get upset if they feel their ad agencys top management 
is preoccupied with a messy takeover fight rather than minding the 
clients business 
and he may have scored points with ogilvy employees by saying he 
intended to keep ogilvy and its management intact and wanted to 
have them run ogilvy autonomously from the former jwt groups j 
walter thompson agency 
ogilvy founder david ogilvy reported to be vehemently opposed 
to sorrells overtures initially was offered and accepted the post 
of chairman of wpp ogilvy chairman kenneth roman stays on in that 
post 
in addition sorrell said he was leaving to ogilvy and the 
managers of its scali mccabe sloves group agency the resolution 
of whether the employees will be allowed to buy scali mccabe 
a little more than a year ago six top executives of the lord 
geller federico einstein agency that was part of jwt group walked 
out leaving a still unresolved legal tangle after sorrell refused 
to let them buy the agency 
this will not be another lord geller roman told reporters 
on tuesday referring to the scali mccabe matter 
ogilvys board backed wpps plan to launch a tender offer of 54 
a share for all of ogilvys stock 
the agreement reached late monday gives wpp another famous 
advertising brand name with a list of blue chip clients like 
american express co american telephone amp telegraph co and sears 
roebuck and co 
the purchase will elevate wpp which placed third among the 
worlds advertising and marketing services companies in 1988 to 
second place with 135 billion in billings a shade behind 
industry leader saatchi amp saatchi plc where sorrell once worked 
nonetheless sorrell said quality rather than quantity has been 
his objective in building wpp 
at a news conference and in remarks to ogilvy shareholders on 
tuesday ogilvys roman said he had investigated every reasonable 
alternative but could not find anything to beat wpps allcash 
buyout offer 
he said management considered everything from white knights to 
white squires to recapitalization to leveraged buyouts he 
declined to identify an potential suitors 
roman said he was confident there would be few if any client 
defections in the wake of the buyout agreement 
some analysts have said wpps acquisition of ogilvy could prompt 
some advertisers to take their business elsewhere thompson works 
for eastman kodak co for instance while ogilvy works for rival 
polaroid corp 
sorrell had proposed a friendly buyout at 45 a share in late 
april sweetened the proposal to 50 a share early last week and 
boosted it to 54 a share this past weekend 
ogilvy stock closed at 32 a share the day before wpps initial 
proposal was disclosed ogilvy closed at 5312 a share tuesday 
down 12 cents from mondays close 
burt manning who heads j walter thompson said he welcomed 
ogilvys addition to wpp and said the buyout improves wpps 
chances for competing in the marketplace 
he said thompson would nonetheless compete fiercely with 
ogilvys main agency ogilvy amp mather worldwide for clients

japonica partners says it is confident it 
received substantial support from cnw shareholders in a proxy 
contest but the results wont be known for at least a week 
meanwhile cnws chairman said tuesday that the railroad 
companys management hoped to assemble a buyout bid to top 
japonicas 722 million offer 
cnw chairman robert schmiege announced managments plans at the 
companys annual meeting while japonica a new yorkbased investor 
group began a 44ashare hostile tender offer for cnws common 
stock 
at the meeting shareholders were asked to vote to either retain 
cnws seven directors or replace them with a slate of japonica 
nominees 
japonica said it was confident its slate won substantial 
shareholder support but the group was disturbed by what it called 
cnws contradictory actions 
japonica said cnw purported to be seeking competing bids for the 
company while at the same time trying to persuade public officials 
to intervene on behalf of the company 
schmiege denied that he or other company officials had pressed 
federal or state officials to step into the battle between his 
company and japonica 
schmiege dropped his bombshell near the end of the annual 
meeting when asked by a shareholder to explain managements role in 
cnws ongoing search for prospective buyers 
the management group has been in active discussions 
discussions that were interrupted only to come over to this meeting 
with an equity partner with banks with a subordinated debt 
player and with an outside player all of whoms cooperation and 
participation is necessary for us to make a bid schmiege said 
we are reasonably optimistic that we will succeed in this 
effort and will be in a position to make a competing bid he told 
the approximately 300 shareholders attending the meeting 
at a news conference later schmiege said he hoped to announce a 
management bid within a week he declined to identify any of the 
parties participating in the discussions 
cnws stock closed tuesday at 4387 up 12 cents on the new 
york stock exchange 
japonica spokesman c howard hardesty who would become cnws 
chairman if his group succeeds said japonica would welcome any 
competing bids but that he hopes cnws board would set a deadline 
for offers 
in a speech to shareholders hardesty said japonica intends to 
sell cnws real estate excess equipment and chicagoarea commuter 
lines to partially recoup buyout costs but it is committed to 
running cnws core railroad freight business 
this is an operating group not a buyandsell group said 
hardesty a former president and chief executive of purolater 
courier corp 
in another development the interstate commerce commission told 
congress tuesday that it would continue to examine the possibility 
of asserting jurisdiction over any nonrailroad takeover of cnw 
but the icc said any attempt to assert jurisdiction over such a 
buyout would result in litigation in which the commissions 
chances of success are questionable 
cnw is the parent of the chicago and northwestern transportation 
co a 6000mile railroad with 8500 employees that operates in 
nine states most of them in the midwest 
cnw also operates western railroad properties a coalhauling 
franchise in wyomings powder river basin that schmiege called 
the most profitable 200 miles of railroad in the country 
japonica has identified the coalhauling business as one of the 
assets that attracted it to cnw

the temptation to share inside information about a 
corporate takeover apparently proved too much for a 24yearold 
paralegal at a prestigious law firm the securities and exchange 
commission says 
in a civil complaint filed tuesday in us district court in 
boston the sec charged that kerry a hurton handled confidential 
papers about plans for a 230 million buyout of a southern 
department store chain while she was working in the boston office 
of skadden arps slate meagher amp flom in 1987 
by passing information about the takeover to friends and 
acquaintances the sec said ms hurton prompted at least five 
people to buy a total of 65020 shares of stock in the birmingham 
ala chain of parisian inc at an average price of 18 a share in 
june and july 1987 
when a buyout by hooker corp was announced later that summer 
parisians stock shot up to more than 30 a share the sec said 
the complaint seeks to force the defendants to return alleged 
profits of 823825 and pay up to three times that amount in 
penalties lawyers for the defendants said they maintain they did 
nothing wrong 
attorney john wall who represents ms hurton said she has 
agreed to sign a consent decree in which she does not acknowledge 
any past wrongdoing but agrees to refrain from passing inside 
information in the future 
i had asked the sec to file the consent decree simultaneously 
with the complaint wall said but apparently they want the 
publicity to be onesided 
the sec said ms hurton worked for skadden arps a leading new 
york law firm from october 1986 to july 1988 during that time 
the firm represented hooker an australian retailing and real 
estate company 
peter p mullen an executive partner in the 970lawyer firm 
said skadden arps cooperated with the sec probe and suspended ms 
hurton in may 1988 as soon as we learned she was under serious 
suspicion he added that she was fired a few weeks later when 
she refused to cooperate with the sec investigation 
from our point of view we feel aggrieved because in effect 
she appropriated information she shouldnt have and flagrantly 
violated our policies if in fact the charges are correct he 
said 
hooker completed the acquisition of parisian for 3065 a share 
or a total of about 230 million in april 1988 mullen said he did 
not believe the insider trading had any effect on the deal 
parisian has 16 stores in alabama texas georgia and florida 
the secs yearlong investigation was sparked by a tip from a 
private individual said john sturc the agencys associate 
director for enforcement in washington 
in its complaint the sec said ms hurton passed the information 
to a close personal friend eric laboz of new york city and 
his former roommate at boston university jonathan r beck of north 
hills ny 
in addition ms hurton allegedly gave the information to two 
real estate investors bruce e maurice of danvers and sheldon m 
stone of marblehead who in july 1987 gave her an 8500 loan 
secured by a second mortgage on a condominium unit sold to her by 
maurice the sec said 
there was an initial price agreed on and subsequently the 
financing terms were changed in a way to make it easier for her to 
buy the apartment sturc said you have to draw your own 
implications about whether the loan was a payoff for the 
information he added 
stephen delinsky attorney for maurice and stone said they are 
sophisticated investors who chose parisian stock without any 
inside information 
there is nothing wrong with buying stock and making money on 
it and there isnt a shred of evidence they did anything more than 
that delinsky said 
the sec complaint charges that sheldon stone gave the stock tip 
to his brother bernard stone of norwell mass a supervisory 
deputy us marshal in boston bernard stone then advised five 
people to buy the stock but they have not been charged with 
knowingly trading on inside information the sec said 
phone calls to ms hurtons home in boston were not returned

less than a week after rose blumkin announced 
she quit nebraska furniture mart in a spat with her grandsons the 
95yearold russian immigrant wants a piece of the business she 
founded 52 years ago 
i would buy it in a minute blumkin said of the carpet 
department of the furniture mart the nations largest furniture 
store at a single location with 300000 square feet of retail space 
i would pay him a high price she said referring to omaha 
investor warren buffett whose berkshire hathaway inc bought 90 
percent of the store in 1983 five million 8 million whatever 
it takes she said 
otherwise mrs blumkin said shed be willing to manage the 
carpet department for buffett without any direction from each of 
the two grandsons she has been know to refer to as hitler 
buffett paid 55 million for his stake in furniture mart but 
mrs blumkin retained the title of chairwoman and remained a 
fixture on the sales floor selling carpeting and furniture from 
atop her motorized golf cart 
if buffett hired her as carpet manager she vowed to reimburse 
him for any losses 
either as an owner or manager mrs blumkin said she wants to 
show how a business should run thats my point 
mrs blumkin popularly known as mrs b hasnt talked to 
buffett since she walked out of the store may 3 she announced last 
week she quit the business because her authority as carpet 
department head had been undermined and she couldnt work with her 
two grandsons 
the two are ronald 40 furniture mart president and chief 
executive and irvin 37 vice president they are the sons of 
louie blumkin 69 vice chairman 
because of the way the deal with buffett was structured louie 
blumkins family has increased its ownership to 20 percent with 
berkshire hathaway retaining 80 percent if mrs blumkin cant talk 
buffett into agreeing to either of those plans she said she might 
set up a new wholesale carpet business and run it out of a vacant 
warehouse she owns directly north of the furniture mart 
such a company which would sell mainly to small furniture 
stores and apartment house owners as well as to consumers would 
put her in competition with her former store she admitted 
the goal isnt to make money mrs blumkin said she would pay 
sales people commissions and share profits with them while donating 
additional profits to charity 
mrs blumkin who typically put in 60 to 70hour weeks on the 
job said she doesnt know what to do with herself without work 
the furniture marts sales of furniture carpets and appliances 
reached 1525 million last year

diplomats and other negotiators from all over the 
world constantly fill up genevas hotels and restaurants but 
ordinary tourists apparently find the place dull 
tourism in geneva has been falling since 1984 and olivier vodoz 
head of the geneva tourist office believes its time to liven 
things up 
geneva must provide nonstop cultural artistic and athletic 
events he said we have to organize large concerts both 
classical and rock which will attract young people 
he thinks the city of 160000 permanent residents suffers from 
its staid image 
seventy percent of the people who are considered tourists are 
either businessmen representatives to international organizations 
or delegates attending conferences he said the other 30 
percent are people simply passing through 
with 270 restaurants many of them catering to the 
expenseaccount crowd a tourist office pamphlet describes geneva 
as one of the worlds gastronomic capitals but most prices are 
out of reach for the backpack crowd geneva also has 39 discos and 
night clubs but many require membership 
vodoz noted that chronic traffic congestion dissuades motorist 
travelers from stopping in geneva which has one of the worlds 
highest automobile densities in order to allviate that problem 
the city is increasing its number of parking places 
high hotel prices 225 a night for a single at a plush 
lakeside hotel also are listed as contributing to the decline in 
tourist business in continental europes second most expensive 
city trailing copenhagen denmark 
with the help of the hoteliers we have made efforts to try to 
reduce prices but we can still do more vodoz said 
some relief is expected from the recent weakening of the swiss 
franc against the dollar and other major currencies and tourist 
officials hope the forecasts of higher crude oil prices will mean a 
return of freespending arabs 
but while it attempts to attract more tourists geneva will 
definitely not change its cityscape vodoz said 
as a result the city may appear less exciting or dynamic than 
other cities we will never become a hong kong or a monaco

in one sense this small native fishing 
village was spared although the tanker exxon valdez hemorrhaged 
more than 10 million gallons of crude just 5 miles from their cove 
local folks have seen little of the oil in their waters 
in another sense theyre not so fortunate its probably 
still going to get us says village president gary kompkoff 
right now most of us would be out collecting salmon spawn 
he said but that has been canceled were not sure if were 
going to be able to fish at all this year ninetyeight percent of 
the annual income of the village is fishing 
tatitlek settled in the late 1800s on the northern shore of 
prince william sound has 95 residents all but 10 are aleut 
indians and many are russian orthodox typical of this part of 
alaska 
tatitlek fishermen have caught salmon in prince william sound 
for decades but since the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef 
on march 24 the familiar cycle of village life has been disrupted 
right now were just trying to understand what this will mean 
for us long term said kompkoff 
the lucrative herring season has already been canceled 
in the nearby fishing town of cordova loss of the herring catch 
will cost 12 million but cordova fisherman are making up some of 
the loss with income from working booms for exxon gathering 
remnants of the spill in their boats 
few of tatitleks fishermen have been offered such work 
says kompkoff weve gone from fear to anger to apprehension 
over this thing its going to be with us for a long time to come

the 48store nordstrom chain is shedding its 
regional focus as it seeks to establish new beachheads on the 
east coast and in the midwest according to the cochairman of the 
seattlebased clothing retailer 
at the department store companys annual meeting tuesday bruce 
nordstrom said the chain will continue to expand nordstrom entered 
the east coast market for the first time last year with a store in 
mclean va 
the company plans to build 14 new stores totaling more than 25 
million square feet of space over the next five years most of the 
stores will be 200000 square feet or larger compared to an 
average 110000 square feet for existing stores 
among them will be the companys first in the midwest nordstrom 
plans a minnesota outlet in the giant mall of america a 
5millionsquarefoot shopping mall and amusement park under 
construction in bloomington 
at least six more stores are on the drawing boards for the 
northeast and the company plans five new california stores in 
smaller markets such as santa barbara 
i guess we are going to continue to build stores as long as 
they continue to do as well as they are doing nordstrom said 
the skys the limit 
the company ended 1988 with record sales of more than 23 
billion and record profits of 123 million 
profit in nordstroms fiscal first quarter grew to nearly 23 
million compared to 192 million in the same period in 1988 
nordstrom stores averaged sales of 380 per square foot last 
year 
we would guess that has got to be at the very top end of the 
industry nordstrom said 
john nordstrom who with his brother james and cousin bruce 
cochair the company said after the meeting that developers are 
offering to pay the company to locate as anchor stores in planned 
malls 
i think its fair to say that when you go into minnesota and 
indiana we got an awful good deal he said because those 
markets arent particularly hot nordstrom plans to open an 
indianapolis store in 1993 
the expansion program will cost more than 500 million over the 
next five years but john nordstrom said the company does not want 
to use too much debt to finance it its debttoequity ratio was 43 
percent in january and nordstrom said the company wants to keep 
that ratio below 50 percent 
the company issued 150 million in longterm debt last year and 
sold 13 million in stock to gain equity financing 
john nordstrom said he did not think the company would seek 
additional equity or debt financing this year preferring to fund 
expansion with retained earnings 
but additional funds could come from stock sales in the future 
shareholders tuesday approved a measure that would allow the 
company to issue 250 million shares of stock up from 100 million 
the provision would allow for additional stock dividends stock 
splits acquisitions and other purposes

continental airlines canceled a planned increase 
in its summer discount fares after several competitors refused to 
follow suit with their own fare hikes 
we cant afford to be noncompetitive in our prices john 
nelson continentals executive vice president for marketing said 
tuesday in announcing that the carrier would not increase fares 
nelson said continental decided to back off the fare hikes 
because most of the other carriers werent imposing increases 
last month the houstonbased airline owned by texas air corp 
announced that its popular max saver tickets bought after may 26 
would increase by as much as 80 
continentals decision to raise summer fares was expected to 
kick off similar increases at other airlines but most carriers 
didnt match continentals plan 
trans world airlines and united airlines said monday they would 
not raise summer fares american airlines delta air lines and 
usair rejected the move earlier this month braniff which said 
earlier it would match continentals rates in cities where they 
compete also is reconsidering 
air fares typically increase during the summer with demand and 
major airlines usually match each others fare increases almost 
immediately

a shareholder proposal to dissolve 
upjohn cos poison pill takeover defense was withdrawn and the 
company is not for sale its chairman says 
theodore cooper on tuesday turned aside rumors that upjohn was 
up for sale based on recent heavy activity in the companys stock

annual meeting the company is not for sale 
upjohns stock climbed 62 cents a share on trading of 13 
million shares tuesday on the new york stock exchange to close at 
3275 there have been rumors that a european competitor has its 
eye on the company

which allows shareholders to buy stock at halfprice if any one 
stockholder acquires 20 percent of the companys 185 million 
outstanding shares

have required the company to cut all ties with south africa and the 
other would have kept proxy voting confidential from company 
officials 
also at the meeting upjohn president lawrence c hoff said

oil was dumped early wednesday into a dry 
fountain in front of the exxon building in new york citys 
rockefeller center 
it was a very small amount and were cleaning it up said 
center spokesman vince silvestri he said the puddle appeared to 
have been motor oil and that the center had no information about 
its origin 
a caller identifying himself only as an alaskan told the 
associated press at 5 am that he and a fellow alaskan had dumped 
50 gallons of oil in the exxon fountain 
they did it so that exxon executives might feel a little 
closer to the story of the oil spill in alaska he said and to 
protest that its taking a long time to clean up 
the spill from the exxonowned oil tanker exxon valdez occurred 
on march 24 off the coast of valdez alaska 
silvestri said he had no estimate of how much oil was dumped 
into the fountain but said it was extremely considerably less 
than 50 gallons 
the fountain has been undergoing repair and had no water in it

the us trade deficit narrowed to 886 
billion in march as a record level of export sales helped to offset 
rising oil imports the government said today 
the commerce department said the improvement in the countrys 
trade balance came from a 74 percent rise in exports which hit a 
record 3078 billion imports were up as well climbing by 3 
percent to 3964 billion 
the march deficit represented a 99 percent improvement from a 
revised february imbalance of 982 billion the march deficit was 
the lowest since january when the deficit fell to 868 billion 
for the first three months of the year the deficit has been 
running at an annual rate of 1094 billion an improvement from 
last years deficit of 11976 billion 
the size of the march trade improvement was a surprise to many 
economists analysts continued to insist however that the 
countrys trade performance will show little if any improvement 
for the whole year as us exports fall victim to recent increases 
in the value of the dollar which make american products more 
expensive on overseas markets 
the deficit for this year will be about the same as last 
year predicted michael evans head of a washington forecasting 
firm i think the march number was artifically low 
such an outcome would represent a blow to the bush 
administration which is counting on continued trade improvement 
this year to fuel overall economic growth 
last years dramatic 21 percent drop in the trade deficit from 
an alltime high of 1521 billion in 1987 accounted for almost 
half of all us economic growth 
the administration hailed the march trade report commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher noted that the deficit for the first 
three months of this year was 10 percent lower than the imbalance 
in the final quarter of 1988 
these numbers support our contention that a favorable movement 
in our exports and imports is under way mosbacher said in a 
statement 
the trade improvement last year came from a sharp jump in export 
sales the administration is hoping to push exports even higher in 
1989 by threatening to retaliate against countries that keep their 
markets closed to us products 
the march improvement came despite the fact that the bill for 
foreign oil climbed to 369 billion up 136 percent from the 
february level reflecting higher prices 
the total oil bill was the highest since november 1987 the 
1597 per barrel price represented the fourth consecutive monthly 
increase 
but us exports fared exceptionally well during the month with 
acrosstheboard increases in most categories the 3078 billion 
in total sales topped the previous record of 2906 billion set 
last december 
the strength in exports helped to give the united states a rare 
trade surplus of 04 billion with western europe the best showing 
since march 1983 the deficit with canada the largest us trading 
partner fell to 02 billion the smallest imbalance in more than 
seven years 
as usual the biggest deficit was recorded with japan a 42 
billion imbalance down from a 47 billion gap in february other 
large deficits were recorded with taiwan 08 billion south 
korea 04 billion and brazil 03 billion 
one primary reason that economists believe the overall trade 
trend will be negative this year is the recent runup in the value 
of the dollar which makes us exports more expensive and imports 
cheaper for american consumers 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc forecast 
that the trade deficit for all of 1989 should total 118 billion 
essentially unchanged from 1988 last year the deficit fell by 
213 percent to 1197 billion after hitting an alltime high of 
1521 billion in 1987 
we are looking for virtual stagnation in the trade balance 
this year ms latta said citing in part the fact that the 
dollar has been rising in recent weeks 
on monday the dollar hit its highest point against the west 
german mark since the end of 1986 and its highest point against the 
japanese yen since november 1987 despite the fact that the united 
states and other governments have been selling greenbacks on the 
open market in an effort to brake the rise 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch said changes 
in the dollars value over the next several months were likely to 
reflect what happens to us interest rates 
as long as us interest rates stay up the dollar will remain 
fairly strong he predicted once interest rates start to come 
down as the fed reacts to the weakening economy then the dollar 
will likely start declining as well 
since a stronger dollar makes american goods more expensive on 
overseas markets and makes imports cheaper for american consumers 
any rise in the dollar is viewed with alarm by economists who 
believe the us currency needs to fall further for america to have 
a chance to narrow the trade deficit to a more sustainable level 
it also presents problems as the new bush administration tries 
to resist growing protectionist pressures in congress the 
administration is facing a congressionally imposed deadline of may 
30 to issue a report targeting countries which have erected major 
barriers to sales of american products 
if the barriers are not removed during an 18month negotiating 
period then the trade act passed last year gives the 
administration the authority to retaliate by erecting barriers 
against that countrys imports into the united states

five days after his fax machine was 
deluged with messages urging him to veto a bill banning unsolicited 
facsimile messages an annoyed gov william a oneill signed the 
measure into law 
a similar campaign in maryland may lead that states governor to 
do the same an aide said 
at least eight states have considered such measures proponents 
complain that such messages tie up fax machines for a minute a page 
and use up expensive special paper the machines often are left 
hooked to telephone lines 24 hours a day 
oneill on tuesday lashed out at the californiabased 
organization that generated the unsolicited messages tying up the 
machine while his office was awaiting word on flood conditions from 
the state office of emergency management 
i had been following discussion about the legislation but 
frankly last week was the first time the need for this kind of 
legislation was brought home to me he said in a message issued 
with the announcement of the signing 
the new law allows people receiving unsolicited facsimile 
machine messages to seek up to 200 in damages 
the national fax users committee based in mission viejo 
calif had told the governor in its messages that it could cost 
the average company 6000 a year in telephone bills to seek 
permission to send fax messages 
maryland gov william donald scaefers office received 343 fax 
messages thursday after the national fax users committee faxed 
hundreds of onepage protest fliers to maryland businesses to relay 
to the him 
if we had any important messages coming in we wouldnt have 
been able to get them through said david s iannucci the 
governors lobbyist 
businesses were urged to sign a protest message on the flier 
tear the message off and fax it to the statehouse about one fifth 
of the businesses receiving the message sent it on to the governor 
ianucci said 
iannucci called the oneday campaign incredibly 
counterproductive saying it might help persuade schaefer to sign 
the bill 
one executive sent his flier with an added message asking 
schaefer to sign the bill into law and stop people from using my 
fax machine as their printing press 
the maryland bill would impose a fine of up to 1000 on anyone 
attempting to fax messages to sell goods services or real estate 
unless the receiver gave prior permission or a previous business 
relationship existed between sender and receiver 
maryland state del gilbert j genn one of the bills sponsors 
said opposition comes from directmail and electronic marketing 
firms which frequently are armed with fax telephone number lists 
and automatic dialing machines 
you can almost imagine the havoc that this could wreak genn 
said 
a similar bill was junked earlier this year by the washington 
legislature 
one of the sponsors of that legislation washington state rep 
ken jacobsen said of the issue this is the ultimate in abusive 
use of a private communication system you get a message you didnt 
want from people you dont know on paper they didnt buy

char de vazquez once walked away from a 
successful mexican export business she created from a single animal 
skin but she didnt leave behind the flair for design that has 
landed her creations in some of the finest stores from new york to 
california 
today her char designs inc manufactures leather and suede 
clothes in new mexico home of the southwest look glorified by 
designer ralph lauren 
char design items ranging from 33 handpainted scarves to 
1800 suede and velvet foxtrimmed opera jackets have been a 
fashion standard for the last decade all of the skirts blouses 
jackets and other items created by de vazquez and her staff of four 
designers are made with lamb skin imported from new zealand and 
dyed in britain many are handpainted with detailed designs 
they are found in saks fifth avenue bonwit teller lord amp 
taylor and neiman marcus notables from sam shepard and robert 
redford to johnny cash and ronald reagan have been seen wearing the 
butterysoft shirts and jackets musician joni mitchell dallas 
star linda gray and newswoman maria shriver also are past 
customers 
overall de vazquez estimates that 100 retailers nationwide 
including her retail outlets in new mexico and her boutique in palm 
desert calif carry char designs collections 
the 44yearold santa fe designer recalls ordinary circumstances 
marked her business beginnings in guadalajara mexico where she 
moved with the mexican chef who became her husband shortly 
thereafter at first he was working and she was not 
she likens the story to a fairy tale 
it was like the millers daughter you throw straw at her and 
shes supposed to spin it into gold i was left alone in this house 
with some leather so i made a handbag and painted it says de 
vazquez who had been a clothing designer in sausalito calif a 
young couple from new york city saw it and asked me to do a 
collection 
in the fall of 1968 the couple took the small line of handbags 
to a boutique show in new york 
every single big department store in new york saw it we were 
nationally known in three to six months an overnight explosion 
de vazquez says 
within a year the mexican business joined by her husband was 
shipping 25000 in merchandise a month and hollywood provided a 
major chunk of the clientele she says 
people would come down in vans and just stock up she says 
by 1976 de vazquez says we had 150 employees and an entire 
town that handpainted all the leather for us 
but while business boomed the marriage faltered 
de vazquez and her two small boys packed up and moved to santa 
fe a place she thought would be good for starting over 
she says the mexican business ceased within a year after her 
departure but with the help of her retired parents and her sister 
sherry stein a san francisco fashion designer who moved to santa 
fe about that time it wasnt long before she was back on track 
with their father helping finance the startup operation the 
sisters began char and sher designs they had their established 
contacts but decided on a strategy that was the reverse of what 
made the earlier mexican business succeed 
i knew the formula de vazquez says but we decided that 
rather than making a lot of cheap stuff we would make real 
expensive stuff and not much of it and get the same dollar 
during the first several years the family with the help of a 
friend who had worked for de vazquez in mexico worked to establish 
a regional market for the designs 
the turning point came in 1979 when the august issue of 
gentlemens quarterly magazine carried a char and sher cowboy shirt 
on its cover model before long the company was at the forefront 
of the southwestern clothing flurry of the early 1980s 
that exploded our entire business and we started selling to 
every single major department store de vazquez says 
stein has since left to study design at pasadena calif art 
college and de vazquez is running the business complex 15 miles 
north of santa fe in the village of cuyamungue 
she and her team of designers work out of studios on the 
property and sewers and cutters work among the reels of soft 
multicolored lamb skin in an adjacent plant her parents adelene 
and lynn blankenship live in a home just behind her viva 
wholesale outlet but they and stein no longer have financial 
interests in the venture 
the peak for the business came in 1984 when it grossed more 
than 2 million de vazquez says while recent annual revenues have 
been in excess of 1 million 
de vazquez says 1982 the year the western market fell off a 
cliff was the most difficult 
there were millions of prairie skirts and all of a sudden 
nobody wanted them de vazquez says accounts went broke but 
being small and innovative we turned on a dime 
that meant giving way to variation in design and for a time 
veering away from the southwest style to more conservative or 
highfashion looks 
for now thanks to the renewed popularity of ralph laurens 
westernwear and the everincreasing trendiness of santa fe itself 
leather skirts coats and blouses seem to be in high demand 
still de vazquez says she is prepared for the death of the 
trend 
it wont make any difference any more de vazquez says 
weve already entered into high fashion if it calls for 
southwest we plug it in if it doesnt we dont

britains civil aviation authority said wednesday 
there is nothing basically wrong with boeings new 747400 
series jets but that the american company has not met modern 
european standards 
there is nothing basically wrong with the aircraft said a 
caa spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom 
but you can liken the situation to that of a motorist who 
some years ago would not have needed rear seat belts but who now 
does 
the us regulatory body the federal aviation administration 
has approved the new aircraft but european aviation authorities 
are threatening to withhold airworthiness certificates for the 
planes unless boeing agrees to a number of design changes 
without the certificates the planes cannot be used for scheduled 
commercial flights 
british airways which has ordered 19 of the new planes said 
wednesday it remains confident it will soon be operating them 
eight of the planes are scheduled to be delivered to the airline 
this year the first next month 
we are confident the issue will be resolved and that we will 
take delivery of the aircraft and introduce them into service as 
planned said a spokesman for british airways also speaking 
anonymously 
european aviation authorities want changes made in the design of 
floor beams supporting the planes upper decks and better 
separation of certain electrical circuits 
boeing has not given enough attention to the way standards 
have been developed said the caa spokesman we are telling 
them there are more modern standards to be taken into 
consideration 
the first of the 747400s to be introduced into europe is 
scheduled to be delivered thursday to the dutch airline klm

the eec commission said wednesday it 
had agreed on the outline of a plan for a social charter which 
would guarantee the rights of workers throughout the 12nation 
trade bloc

guarantee the free movement of workers between the 12 european 
economic community countries it would also ensure the workers 
social security protection working conditions and education 
programs 
vasso papandreou the eecs commissioner for social affairs and 
employment said the commission wanted to guarantee that everybody 
benefited from the eecs plans to dismantle all trade and other 
barriers by the end of 1992 
europe can be built neither against the wishes of companies 
nor against the wishes of workers or citizens it needs the full 
participation of all social groups she said

charter to be given to the commission by the eec summit meeting in 
paris at the end of this year

grain and soybean futures opened lower this 
morning on the chicago board of trade as predictions of rain 
continue to drag down prices 
the drop in prices is due to government and private forecasts of 
aboveaverage rainfall in parts of iowa minnesota and other 
western crop states affected recently by dry weather said rich 
feltes an analyst with refco inc in chicago 
the strong dollar is creating anemic demand in europe for us 
soybean products that and increasing exports of brazilian soybeans 
is putting pressure on soybean futures 
traders also are noting that the drag on corn and wheat prices 
is being caused by the failure of the soviet union to order 
additional grain through the us export bonus program 
in early trading wheat was a cent lower to cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 410 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 1 cents lower with may at 277 a bushel oats were 3

suitors who have made proposals to buy 
strikebound eastern airlines have been told to put up or shut 
up and put at least 100 million in cash on the table 
david i shapiro the bankruptcy examiner for eastern said 
tuesday there are no real live offers to buy the carrier 
in response one of the two groups bidding for eastern said late 
tuesday it planned to revise its proposal with a new plan that will 
include substantial equity capital 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland meanwhile said eastern 
has provided valid reasons for its plan to sell its prized 
northeast shuttle service eastern already has an agreement to sell 
the shuttle to developer donald trump for 365 million but lifland 
gave the airline until monday to consider a higher bid by america 
west airlines 
joel zweibel the attorney representing easterns major 
creditors said they support a prompt sale of the new 
yorkwashingtonboston service 
at an allday bankruptcy hearing shapiro said there are no 
real live offers out there yet for all of eastern two investor 
groups have submitted buyout proposals to the court for the whole 
airline including the shuttle 
this is not bankruptcy as usual this is an important case 
involving the interests of the public shapiro told a packed 
humid courtroom its time to put up or shut up 
he asked the interested suitors to put at least 100 million of 
their own cash at risk the two buyout proposals depend heavily on 
debt financing according to sources close to the situation 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a paralyzing 
strike by its machinists union that was supported by pilots and 
flight attendants the bankruptcy court must approve any sale of 
eastern or any of its assets including the shuttle service 
two investor groups one headed by chicago commodities trader 
joseph ritchie and the other by former piedmont airlines chairman 
william howard have submitted formal bids 
shapiro said the two groups have told him their proposals are 
opening shots in an eventual negotiating process rather than 
final offers 
the pilots union released a statement late tuesday from the 
ritchie group saying it plans to submit a revised offer that would 
address shapiros concerns over the need for substantial equity 
capital the statement noted the plan would be the first to 
propose putting substantial equity capital as opposed to borrowed 
funds at risk in an eastern buyout 
lewis kaden an attorney representing the howard group told 
reporters outside the courtroom that his group would also consider 
buying the shuttle alone at a price below that offered by america 
west but higher than trumps 
eastern president phil bakes told the court that the shuttle 
could easily be detached from the rest of the airlines operations 
part of the 300 million net profit expected to be gained from the 
sale to trump will go to repay debts and rebuild other eastern 
operations he said 
eastern has proposed a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and 
sell some 18 billion in assets separately including the shuttle 
as part of the plan eastern announced in miami tuesday an 
agreement to sell 15 aircraft to uasinvest an aircraft leasing 
company for 2775 million the airline has announced several 
similar deals in recent weeks 
phoenixbased america west has offered to pay 415 million for 
the shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 757s in a total package 
worth 751 million 
trumps 365 million agreement with frank lorenzo chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp expires on may 27 under their 
contract the developer would receive 8 million from eastern if 
the shuttle deal collapses 
lifland said eastern had articulated a good sound business 
reason to sell the shuttle although he has not yet decided 
whether such a sale would be in the airlines best interests he 
postponed the next hearing on eastern until monday to give the 
airline time to evaluate the offers 
lifland denied a request by a group of new york financial 
institutions for more time to submit a bid for eastern because it 
couldnt meet last wednesdays deadline shapiro called the groups 
bid frivolous 
the consortium had said it would offer around 1 billion for 
eastern but only if the deal also included assets that lorenzo 
sold to other airlines after he acquired eastern in early 1986

karen oconnor vice president of aemmp record 
co hypes the companys latest release in the best tradition of 
music promoters 
i really havent heard anything in a long time that was 
powerful as this music she says its a lot better than what 
ive been hearing on the radio lately 
oconnor is pushing a record but if she pushes a bit too hard 
perhaps shes entitled the record by the bad examples will be 
aemmps sole release this year and the executive is only 20 years 
old 
aemmp pronounced amp is a real record company owned by 
columbia college a private liberalarts school in downtown chicago 
with an enrollment of about 6500 
aemmp also is a class company executives and workers are 
students learning to operate what singersongwriter joni mitchell 
once called the starmaker machinery behind the popular songs 
for oconnor who quit two parttime jobs and spent her spring 
break in chicago to devote more time to this years project the 
class could become a springboard to a job with a major record 
company and advance her toward the goal of managing a bigname 
rocker 
this class is going to give us great resumes she said 
the objective of the class called decisionmaking music 
business is to find a musical act sign it to a contract 
manufacture and market its record and get the band signed to a 
major record company 
so success for oconnor and her approximately 20 classmates also 
would give a boost to the bad examples a poprock quartet selected 
by the class from among about 200 acts as the brightest star on 
chicagos club scene 
the more different people that are excited about the music and 
working for it the better it helps us said ralph covert the 
groups songwriter and lead singer 
aemmp released the threesong set by the bad examples on april 
26 in two formats 800 12inch vinyl records and 200 cassette 
tapes the recordrelease party at a chicagoarea nightspot marked 
the completion of the production phase of the project and the 
beginning of the marketing push which includes pestering radio 
stations into playing the music 
if youre going pop you cant exist without airplay said 
chuck suber a cocreator of the class you cant even get into a 
record store without something thats been presold on the air 
oconnor said aemmp would pitch the bad examples release to all 
national record companies but she said it was at least as 
important to promote the band via airplay club appearances 
perhaps even a concert tour of college towns 
if we start a buzz in chicago theyre going to be that much 
more interested in the product she said 
the aemmp records class was founded in 1982 by suber who had 
just stepped down after 24 years as publisher of down beat 
magazine a jazz monthly and irwin steinberg who had just retired 
as chairman of new yorkbased polygram records inc 
suber also had taught parttime for many years in columbias 
arts entertainment and media management program for which the 
inhouse record company is named although the department is now 
called simply the management department 
suber and steinberg still teach the academic portions of the 
twosemester class debra hale a graduate student who served as 
president of the 1984 aemmp class oversees the record companys 
progress 
steinberg sees the class as a chance for students to do 
something real rather than a mock effort 
theyve got to put themselves on the line and go to market 
with the artist and experience either the success or defeat he 
said in a telephone interview from new york its more than 
theoretical its real 
aemmps greatest success to date was in 1987 when its release 
of a 12inch single by an urbandance trio called atm led to the 
groups being signed to a threeyear deal with omni records a 
philadelphia label distributed by the atlantic recording corp 
the groups first omni release a 12inch single titled try 
me got some airplay on the east coast last summer and a 
followup is due out this summer said atms leader ardie rowe 
suber said atms contract with omni calls for aemmp to receive 2 
percent of the revenues from the groups first two releases after 
omni has recouped the advance it paid the artists but atms first 
release didnt sell enough copies to bring any money back to the 
college he said 
since the only area of recordcompany management not covered is 
studio recording the class begins its star search with a call for 
productionquality tapes 
after the students select an act aemmp contracts with a record 
maker to press the vinyl copies a tape duplicator to make the 
cassettes and an albumjacket company to package the product 
with only a 1500 budget the students often rely on the good 
will of manufacturers like agi inc a suburban chicago albumcover 
manufacturer that has donated services to aemmp since the class was 
created 
this years musical entries were screened by aemmps 
artistsandrepertoire committee which selected five acts to 
present to the entire class for a final decision 
suber said choosing the right act one with a fresh yet 
commercially palatable sound is the most difficult task the 
students face 
they have to change their attitude from music consumers to 
music producers and thats not easy when youre a dedicated music 
fan suber said 
student henry carpenter who headed the artsandrepertoire 
committee agreed 
my personal taste in music is alternative music and heavy 
metal he said but when we went through the tapes i looked 
for what i thought would be the most marketable product 
the bad examples championed by oconnor emerged victorious 
after an interclass battle settled by field trips to two 
nightclubs to see the finalists in action 
seeing them live and seeing the reaction of the people who go 
to their show im really behind the bad examples now said 
carpenter who had led the faction favoring another band im 
really confident they can get a major record deal

cocoa prices hit a 14year low wednesday before 
recovering to finish the day higher on the london market 
the selling wave reflected the prospect of a glutted market for 
the fifth consecutive season in 198889 traders said 
cocoa for july delivery closed at 1158 a metric ton up 164 
from tuesdays close earlier in the day the contract traded at 
the 14year low of 1140 
traders said most experts are predicting record world production 
this season of about 23 million metric tons that would be about 
200000 metric tons more than expected consumption the biggest 
surplus ever 
in addition signs that the ivory coast which has 
international debts of more than 14 billion could be close to 
abandoning its costly pricesupport policy also have encouraged 
selling traders said 
the present price the government pays its cocoa farmers is equal 
to about 1312 a ton traders said 
ivory coasts international creditors have been pressing 
strongly for a cut for some time according to banking sources 
ivory coast which is africas biggest producer and relies on 
cocoa for about a third of its export revenues has for the past 
year been refusing to sell at a price below its breakeven level 
as a result the nation has accumulated stocks of about 400000 
tons of which half already have been put into storage in europe 
for at least two years 
traders also said there was a likelihood of a record ivorian 
harvest of up to 720000 tons 100000 tones more than initial 
forecasts for the october 1988september1989 season

the captain of the exxon valdez drank 
alcoholic beverages with shipmates while ashore before the tanker 
struck a reef in prince william sound according to documents 
released by a federal panel 
a stack of documents released by the national transportation 
safety board on tuesday contained interviews detailing drinking by 
capt joseph hazelwood before the ship left valdez and on at least 
one occasion aboard ship 
the panel is investigating the nations worst oil spill caused 
when the exxon valdez hit a reef on march 24 and spilled nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil 
the ships chief engineer jerzy glowacki and its radio officer 
told investigators they went ashore with hazelwood as the tanker 
was being loaded according to the documents 
glowacki and the radio officer said hazelwood and a shipping 
pilot had nonalcoholic drinks at a restaurant while the others at 
the table had beer 
hazelwood and his crewmen split up to do some shopping and met 
later at a bar the radio officer said when he arrived at about 
430 pm march 23 hazelwood and glowacki already were there he 
said each bought one or more rounds of drinks 
he said hazelwood drank a clear beverage glowacki drank gin and 
tonic and he drank beer glowacki told investigators he had three 
gin and tonics but did not recall how much hazelwood had to drink 
no further information could be developed concerning the 
activities of the three men between lunch at the restaurant and 
their meeting at the bar the documents state 
glowacki said the three left the bar at about 7 pm and 
returned to the restaurant where they had lunch and ordered two 
pizzas glowacki and the radio officer agreed each of the three men 
had one alcoholic drink as they waited 
the radio officer also reported seeing hazelwood drinking aboard 
ship on one occasion during a long voyage in february 
according to the documents hazelwood admitted drinking 
nonalcholic beer aboard the vessel on march 24 
on tuesday shipping pilot william e murphy told the ntsb 
panel that he smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath before the the 
march 24 accident but the captain did not act intoxicated 
other crewmen told the panel they didnt notice alcohol on 
hazelwoods breath 
third mate gregory t cousins whom hazelwood left in charge on 
the vessels bridge testified tuesday that the ship had been on 
automatic pilot until 12 minutes before it ran aground in prince 
william sound 
cousins who was not certified to operate the ship said he 
could not explain why it was on automatic pilot when exxon policy 
limits use of the device to open waters 
murphy who helped pilot the tanker through a narrow part of 
prince william sound before the ship hit a charted reef said that 
he had a good opinion of hazelwoods skill before the accident 
i would characterize it as outstanding he said 
hazelwood failed sobriety tests administered about nine hours 
after the march 24 wreck 
murphy said hazelwood smelled of alcohol but spoke clearly and 
gave no sign of impaired judgment cousins and four other crew 
members agreed that hazelwood did not seem intoxicated but added 
that they did not smell any alcohol on the captain 
the witnesses said exxon has a strict policy against alcohol or 
drugs on board and they testified they had never seen the policy 
violated they also said they had never had their bags searched for 
alcohol or drugs 
cousins said hazelwood had left the bridge to send out messages 
from his office although leaving an uncertified crewman in charge 
is against company policy cousins said other captains have left 
him alone at the helm for brief periods 
murphy who left the ship about 45 minutes before it ran 
aground said he found it unusual that hazelwood was not on the 
bridge for much of the time 
cousins said hazelwood had ordered the 987foot tanker out of 
the normal traffic lanes to avoid ice 
cousins said he tried to change course back toward the lanes 
but the ship did not respond he tried a sharper turn but the 
tanker continued toward bligh reef 
its a source of trouble for me as to why the vessel did not 
track away from that track line he said 
moments before the wreck cousins called hazelwood 
i said to him at that time i think were in serious 
trouble at the end of that talk is when i felt the initial 
shock he said 
several seconds passed and we experienced a series of jolts to 
the vessel by the time we came to a full stop id estimate we 
felt a series of six jolts he recalled 
there seemed to be a hesitation and i spun the wheel hard 
left by that time i believe we were hard aground 
cousins said there had been no discussion earlier about reducing 
speed as it neared the ice slowing down would have made the ship 
harder to maneuver he said 
the exxon valdez was traveling between half and full speed at 
the time of the accident according to testimony 
after the grounding hazelwood returned to the bridge and 
ordered crew members to assess the damage then he tried to rock 
the tanker free without success cousins said 
i cannot think of anything i couldve done differently 
cousins concluded 
during the five days of hearings the panel plans to question 
more than two dozen witnesses including coast guard personnel and 
exxon executives hazelwood who is charged with operating a vessel 
while drunk will not testify the fired captain is free on bail 
and faces trial june 20 in valdez 
the panel includes representatives of the state exxon the 
coast guard and alyeska pipeline service co a consortium of oil 
companies that runs the 800mile transalaska pipeline 
the boards report on the cause of the accident will take up to 
a year to complete

minorco sa the south africacontrolled mining 
concern said wednesday it will continue pursuing natural resources 
companies despite its failed 59 billion bid for consolidated gold 
fields plc 
luxembourgbased minorco on tuesday conceded defeat in its 
eightmonth takeover attempt for gold fields in a deal that would 
have created the worlds largest gold company 
the concession came after a federal judge in new york refused to 
lift an order blocking minorco from acquiring more than 30 percent 
of gold fields before the bid was to expire under british takeover 
regulations 
minorco which is 60 percent owned by the oppenheimer familys 
anglo american corp and de beers consolidated mines ltd gold and 
diamond mining interests said its board would meet next month to 
decide the companys next move 
minorco remains the largest single shareholder in the british 
mining giant with a 299 percent stake and deciding whether to 
hold on to or sell it likely will be on the boards agenda 
we will now energetically implement our strategy of 
transforming minorco into an operating company minorco chief 
executive sir michael edwardes said 
minorco had pursued gold fields to fulfill that goal 
minorco is now a familiar name in the market both in the uk 
and overseas and has a very positive future edwardes said 
keith irons a minorco vice president said he expects the 
company to progress toward its strategic goal of being a global 
business operating in natural resources mainly through 100 percent 
owned subsidiaries 
that means minorco might increase or sell one or more of its 
existing partial stakes 
besides the gold fields stake which represents about onethird 
of minorcos 4 billion in assets the company also owns 30 percent 
of engelhard corp and 48 percent of adobe resources corp both of 
the united states 
minorco also holds 56 percent of inspiration resources corp of 
the united states but controls just 42 percent of the votes 
in britain the company has a 36 percent stake in charter 
consolidated plc the company has 1 billion in cash and borrowing 
facilities of 23 billion good until september 1991 irons said 
adding that minorco would continue to focus on north america and 
europe

san juan airlines will stop flying 
and close its headquarters in port angeles if the canadian 
government approves the sale of its four canadian routes to horizon 
air san juan president jim sherrell said 
this is the end of a long era sherrell said monday its 
tough to let that go 
san juan will continue to operate its shuttle express ground 
transportation service at seattletacoma international airport 
san juan describes itself as the nations oldest commuter 
airline its roots go back to orcas island air service which began 
flying from orcas island in the san juan archipelago to bellingham 
wash in 1947 sherrell bought the airline in 1979 
the decision on selling the routes is expected this summer from 
canadas national transportation agency the sale already has been 
authorized by the us department of transportation and won 
conditional approval from canada 
horizon already is flying the routes though technically they 
still belong to san juan 
san juan has been cutting back flight operations since december 
when it announced that a preliminary sales agreement had been 
reached with horizon on the port angelesvictoria 
seattlevancouver bellinghamvancouver and seattlevictoria routes 
at one time san juan employed about 230 people only a year 
ago it had 128 workers in port angeles making it one of clallam 
countys top industrial employers 
today just 15 people still work for the airline in port 
angeles and a dozen of those jobs should be phased out in 30 days 
sherrell said 
san juan once served vancouver and victoria british columbia 
portland ore seattle everett bellingham and port angeles 
wash and the san juan islands now the company makes a single 
round trip five days a week between port angeles and friday harbor 
this year san juan has reduced its fleet from 15 aircraft to a 
single cessna 402 
sherrell said changes in the commuter airline market were 
responsible for the decision to sell san juans canadian routes 
small independent commuter airlines are facing increasing 
competition from regional carriers which are growing and aligning 
with major airlines he said 
i didnt want to get out of the airline industry sherrell 
said time dictated that we get out of it

steel imports in march fell to their lowest 
level in six years and their share of the domestic market shrank to 
172 percent well within the goal of the us import quotas a 
domestic industry group said wednesday 
the months 122 million tons of imports represented just 129 
percent of the market when excluding 129000 tons of semifinished 
steel us companies imported to supply their own mills according 
to an importers group 
semifinished imports have been in critical demand by us 
rolling mills since early 1988 said john griffin president of 
the american institute for imported steel of new york which 
represents importers 
exports meanwhile rose in march to 606000 tons the largest 
monthly total since july 1974 
first quarter exports totaled 11 million tons compared with 
303000 tons in the 1988 first quarter the american iron and steel 
institute in washington which represents domestic producers said 
the rival groups interpret commerce department information to 
serve their competing interests 
the domestic group said steel prices in foreign markets are 
higher than in the united states making this country less 
attractive to foreign producers 
the leading steelproducing nations appear to be shipping less 
metal in than authorized under the individual quotas they 
negotiated with the united states the aisi said foreign producers 
undershipped their quotas by 25 percent last year 
imports were 134 million tons in february and 184 million tons 
in march 1988 
the 122 million tons shipped this march was the lowest since 
april 1983 the import tonnage represented even less of the 
domestic supply because shipments by us producers were higher 
that month the aisi said 
the fiveyear quotas instituted by former president reagan in 
late 1984 were intended to limit foreign steel to around 20 percent 
of the us market domestic steelmakers are campaigning to have 
them renewed beyond their sept 31 expiration

when port everglades director joel 
alesi swivels around in his leather desk chair he surveys gleaming 
white cruise ships embarking on tropical voyages and giant cranes 
unloading cargo vessels at the nations secondbusiest cruise port 
but in his minds eye he envisions a mammoth passenger ship 
bigger than the biggest aircraft carrier gliding in from the 
atlantic 
the dream is also shared by port officials in miami and near 
cape canaveral as the competition intensifies for the largest 
cruise ship ever proposed 
although the phoenix world city ship is still anchored to the 
drawing boards three ports that handle nearly 80 percent of the 
worlds cruise ship business are locked in a winnertakeall battle 
to become the vessels home port when and if it ever sails 
at stake say port officials is a greater share of the rapidly 
growing 55 billion passenger ship industry and the prestige of 
hosting a vessel more massive than the three largest cruise ships 
combined 
each port director believes he holds the proper blend of 
location and amenities to come out on top when the home port is 
announced this summer 
we feel we are in very favorable position both 
geographically and physically to accommodate the phoenix 
boasted alesi at the fort lauderdalearea port 
i think we have an extremely good shot said charles 
rowland executive director of port canaveral were an 
upandcoming port and can give the phoenix special attention 
the question is can the phoenix afford not to come to miami 
asked carmen lunetta director of the port of miami which handled 
65 percent of the worlds 35 million cruise passengers last year 
making it no 1 
john rogers spokesman for the new yorkbased world city corp 
said a home port decision should be made in 30 to 45 days until 
then company policy prohibits any comments about the project he 
said 
billed in its promotional literature as a daring project by 
virtue of its size and cost the estimated 13 billion phoenix 
project was conceived by knut utstein kloster who resigned in 1986 
as chairman of kloster group owners of norwegian caribbean lines 
and royal viking line 
the plans call for its 5200 passengers to be housed in three 
hotels on the 1260foot twinhulled vessel more than 200 feet 
longer than any operating cruise ship 
along its main street would be a chapel cafes a 
100000volume library and a 2500seat theater large enough to 
handle a broadway musical 
at 250000 registered tons the proposed ship would be heavier 
than the combined weight of the three largest cruise ships since 
no caribbean port would be deep enough to handle the ship onboard 
yachts would ferry passengers and the 1850member crew 
rogers said world city is negotiating with west german 
shipbuilders for a scheduled 1992 completion date but no deal has 
been struck 
the 2600passenger sovereign of the seas owned by miamibased 
royal caribbean lines is considered the worlds largest cruise 
ship measured by gross tons but other ships are longer such as 
the 963foot queen elizabeth ii and the 1041foot france 
industry representatives from around the world at a recent miami 
convention predicted the number of cruise ship passengers should 
continue to grow at 12 percent annually topping 22 million 
passengers by 2000 
the efforts to lure the ship are nearly as grand as the project 
itself 
at canaveral port officials have offered to lease world city 95 
acres of land to build four 350room hotels and a marina 
meanwhile a new dock for the phoenix is expected to cost between

expected to add at least two new cruise ships by next year said 
rowland 
he also said world city has been studying other cruise lines 
tieins with nearby attractions such as disney world and sea world 
i dont see how the world city people could ask for anything 
more than what we have here said rowland 
but thats what they are saying in miami and port everglades 
alesi said plans to build a 1000room hotel complex and 
convention center at port everglades are enticing to phoenix 
planners in addition the port is the deepest in florida and less 
than 1 miles from the main atlantic shipping lanes 
just in terms of our location we have to be attractive to the 
phoenix said alesi whose port handled 16 million cruise 
passengers last year 
in miami which expects 3 million cruise passengers this year 
lunetta said the port is the obvious choice for the worlds largest 
cruise ship 
we could get ready to handle the phoenix in 12 months said

the financing for the project 
the only thing thats heating up is the competition with the 
ports said lewis i dont think the project is going anywhere

a betterthanexpected report on international 
trade helped the stock market post a modest gain today 
the commerce department reported this morning that the nations 
trade deficit narrowed to 886 billion in march from a

advance estimates on wall street had called for a march deficit 
of 10 billion or more 
the news sent the dollar sharply higher in foreign exchange but 
analysts said it got a less exuberant response in the bond and

a united auto workers local election 
completed wednesday shows division in the union over the 
japanesestyle team concept management adopted a year ago at 
general motors corps local camaro factory 
candidates unhappy with the system at gms van nuys plant won 
five of seven positions as local 645s delegates to the uaws 
annual national convention which runs june 1822 in anaheim 
opponents believe the company takes advantage of cooperative 
management to erase work rules it couldnt negotiate away at the 
bargaining table union leaders want to give the concept a chance 
the van nuys plant has about 4000 workers voting began 
tuesday with night shift workers casting their ballots early 
wednesday morning 
the five successful candidates who ran as opponents of the team 
concept were cal gutierrez 876 votes pete lopez 846 votes jake 
flukers 760 votes leroy padilla 709 votes and mark masaoka 699 
votes 
the two other winners who favor the team concept were 
bargaining committee chairman richard ruppert 828 votes and 
financial secretarytreasurer joe garcia 758 votes 
results were released by the unions assistant regional 
director henry gonzalez who said the local president and vice 
president did not run 
opponents of team management are part of a nationwide movement 
within the uaw that calls itself new directions and favors a more 
confrontational approach to gm management led by union locals at 
gm plants around st louis and detroit the movement is expected to 
challenge the unions leadership at the convention 
gonzalez argued in an interview tuesday that the team system is 
slowly improving the lot of workers in van nuys he suggested the 
issue was created to use against union leaders 
anybody thats on the outside looking in has to create an 
issue to run against and i guess their issue is the team 
concept gonzalez said 
the team management system was instituted last year at plant 
which produces chevrolet camaros and pontiac firebirds 
the change came after current union leaders won a close election 
in june 1988 ousting officers opposed to cooperation 
under the new system workers are divided into teams of six and 
those teams take part in decisions on how their jobs will be done 
backers note the systems give a worker the power to stop the 
assembly line to make sure his or her task is done right that 
power is said to be a key ingredient in worker satisfaction 
dissidents point to temporary layoffs imposed at the plant since 
then to buttress their argument that the new system didnt really 
save jobs as it was supposed to 
management says the socalled rolling layoffs were needed 
because of lack of demand for the cars the other camaro and 
firebird plant in norwood ohio was shut down and some in the 
union believe that was because the company saw the van nuys 
workforce as more accommodating

the chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said wednesday his agency needs additional power to curb 
abuses by banks and savings institutions that raise highcost 
deposits through brokers 
fdic chairman l william seidman testifying before a house 
banking subcommittee split from other bank regulators who said 
current law provides them with enough authority 
the practice of raising deposits through brokers has been 
criticized for making the savings and loan crisis worse the funds 
raised through brokers who earn fees by channeling clients money 
to institutions paying the highest interest rates has allowed some 
shaky institutions to grow far more rapidly than they could have 
through local deposits 
healthy banks and sampls object to the practice because they often 
have to raise their rates to compete 
but all the regulators including seidman said brokered 
deposits used properly can be beneficial allowing institutions 
to raise money to make a big loan or meet a temporary cash crunch 
sometimes they are the only way for troubled institutions to stay 
afloat while they wait the government to shut them down 
forbidding brokered deposits is a little bit like saying we 
should abolish the manufacturing of automobiles because some people 
drive too fast said comptroller of the currency robert l 
clarke who regulates nationally chartered banks 
clark federal reserve board member h robert heller and federal 
home loan bank board chairman m danny wall who oversees savings 
and loans told the subcommittee on general oversight and 
investigations that brokered deposits are currently under control 
they recommended further study before enacting legislation on the 
subject 
sen frank murkowski ralaska sponsored a provision on 
brokered deposits in sampl bailout legislation which passed the 
senate last month it would bar weak institutions from using 
deposits brokers unless the institutions get a waiver from the fdic 
that is the reverse of the current practice under which brokered 
deposits are assumed to be permissible unless regulators say 
otherwise 
rep stephen neal dnc sponsored a similar section in a bill 
passed earlier this month by the house banking committee 
rep carroll hubbard dky chairman of the subcommittee said 
he held wednesdays hearing to serve as a basis for debate when the 
sampl legislation reaches the house floor 
but he said he has not yet decided whether to attempt to delete 
the brokered deposit clause 
seidman who under president bushs proposal to close or merge 
failed sampls would get broad new power to oversee savings and loans 
in addition to commercial banks said he would not object getting 
specific authority to act against brokered deposits 
regulators currently must prove the deposits are being used 
unsafely before they can act 
but seidman said he would prefer his agency to be permitted to 
curb brokered deposits at healthy institutions which at times use 
them unwisely and that it be able to set general rules on brokered 
deposits rather than be forced to grant waivers to individual 
institutions 
murkowski testifying before hubbards panel said securities 
brokers who earn fees for placing deposits are lobbying against 
his proposal 
the deposits have soared in popularity particularly after 
investors fled the market following the 1987 stock crash 
he said brokered deposits now account for 74 percent of sampl 
deposits up from 26 percent for sampls in june 1983 they account 
for 53 percent of commercial bank deposits he said

the democraticcontrolled congress gave final 
approval wednesday to legislation raising the minimum wage for the 
first time in eight years but president bush said it was 
inevitable he would kill the measure with the first veto of his 
administration 
the vote was 6337 to approve the plan which would boost the 
minimum wage from 335 an hour to 455 by october 1991 that vote 
left supporters four votes shy of the 67 needed in the senate to 
override bushs veto 
only hours earlier bush had vowed anew that his first veto 
awaits the bill 
for me the choice is very clear bush said if the 
majority of the congress rejects my offer of a reasonable 
compromise and we have made such a proposal a veto is going to 
be inevitable 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that when the 
legislation reaches the presidents desk bush will veto it 
instantly faster than the eye can see 
majority democrats are also short of that twothirds override 
margin in the house which passed the bill earlier this month but 
sponsors have promised a veto override attempt nonetheless as part 
of an escalating political battle over the minimum wage and a 
larger symbolic clash for momentum on domestic initiatives 
nonetheless being able get a minimumwage bill out of congress 
was a symbolic victory of sorts for its sponsors who for the past 
eight years could not get their proposal even that far because of 
thenpresident reagans vehement opposition 
and they vowed to advance another bill if bush quashes the 
measure passed wednesday 
we want to make it very clear that this fight is not going to 
go away and we are going to continue this battle until we get a 
fair and just increase in the minimum wage sen edward m 
kennedy dmass told reporters after the vote 
democratic congressional leaders are planning a mock signing 
ceremony before formally transmitting the measure to the white 
house and plan to hold the bill until after congress returns from 
a memorial day recess so that bush cannot veto it while sponsors 
are away from washington 
leading the gop effort in wednesdays debate sen orrin hatch 
rutah said the legislation will translate into the loss of 
hundreds of thousands of jobs and job opportunities for those who 
most need our help 
but kennedy the measures senate sponsor rejected such 
assertions and made a final call for bush to change his position 
the fundamental issue the overriding issue is whether the 
congress of the united state will once again make the minimum wage 
a living wage and thereby ease the burden of poverty pressing down 
on millions of our fellow citizens on the lowest rung of the 
economic ladder kennedy said the administration proposal is a 
sham 
in a lengthy attack on bushs stance senate majority leader 
george mitchell said the president was choosing the wrong issue on 
which to test his political muscle saying the eight year freeze in 
the floor wage has cost minimumwage workers 40 percent of their 
buying power 
it is unconscionable and unfair to the weakest and most 
vulnerable workers in our country to hold their wages hostage in 
this way the maine democrat said there should be another 
better way for this test of political will to be conducted than at 
their expense 
the minimumwage fight has been brewing since congress convened 
in january with the arguments little changed although the 
legislation itself has been revised significantly since its 
introduction with the final product emerging from a housesenate 
conference committee three weeks ago 
sponsors of the leadership measure trimmed their final minimum 
wage target from 465 to 455 but moved up the dates the three 
annual incremental increases are to take effect from january to 
october they also added a provision allowing employers to pay 
employees with fewer than 60 days work experience a subminimum 
wage 
still the final product is far from a more modest proposal for 
bush who from the outset has adopted a takeitorleaveit stance 
the presidents measure rejected by both the house and senate 
called for a 425 an hour wage floor by january 1992 but would 
allow employers to pay all new hires a subminimum for up to six 
months regardless of prior work experience 
most democrats have denounced bushs training wage proposal 
as a blatant attempt to allow employers to skirt paying the minimum 
wage republicans have countered that it would protect thousands of 
jobs that they say will be lost if the minimum wage is increased 
and said the democrats twomonth provision is too restrictive and 
would require burdensome recordkeeping 
bush has been urged by probusiness lobbying forces to venture 
outside of washington for an elaborate veto ceremony in a community 
in the south or west where the president could present his argument 
about the potential for massive job losses if the minimum wage is 
increased without establishing a sixmonth subminimum the white 
house has not said whether bush will do so

florida officials on wednesday accused the penny 
stock brokerage blinder robinson and co inc of a variety of 
securities law violations and moved to kick the firm out of the 
state 
comptroller gerald lewis said the state named 29 former and 
current employees in a civil action to revoke their licenses 
including company president meyer blinder and his son vice 
president larry blinder 
denverbased blinder which has offices in 37 states including 
10 in florida and the district of columbia was ordered to 
immediately stop violating florida securities laws 
the company has 21 days to ask for a hearing to stop its florida 
licenses from being revoked 
rick rouse director of compliance for blinder robinson 
expressed his confidence that the firm was acting in full 
compliance with floirda law and said it would vigorously defend 
itself against the charges 
i feel it is totally irresponsible for the department not to 
have related its concerns to me before they filed charges rouse 
said in a statement issued wednesday whenever there have been 
problems we have addressed them 
the alleged florida violations could result in more than 5 
million in fines 
the action followed a 2year state investigation of blinder 
triggered by numerous complaints and queries from clients lewis 
said at a news conference 
the brokerage already is under investigation by state and 
federal authorities elsewhere the florida comptrollers case is 
being turned over to state prosecutors for possible criminal action 
the history of their company is one of litigation lewis 
said were ready for battle 
thousands of investors in florida are believed to have been 
bilked by blinder which has been licensed in the state since 1973 
securities officials said the officials said they did not have a 
figure for the total amount of the alleged fraud 
penny stocks are lowpriced thinly traded securities that 
generally cost less than 5 per share and are traded over the 
counter rather than on a stock exchange 
lewis said alleged violations included manipulations in the 
market for certain penny stocks sale of unregistered securities 
unreasonable markups failure to maintain proper records and 
supervise employees and unauthorized trading 
he charged that in one case where an 80yearold client lost 
about 30000 on penny stocks blinder employees bought and sold 
stocks without the clients permission conducted excessive stock 
trades just to earn commissions and inflated the purchase price of 
certain stock 
the firms troubles with the securities and exchange commission 
date to 1980 and include a probe initiated by the sec in april 1987 
into allegations that blinder robinson had defrauded customers 
the sec has been investigating allegations dating to august 1983 
that blinder robinson violated federal law by marketing nine 
distributions of unregistered securities by falsely representing 
the business prospects of the companies involved and by 
excessively marking up the prices of the securities 
the sec had two other actions pending against the company for 
alleged bookkeeping violations 
last month a us district court judge in denver dismissed 
charges in one of those cases a 1983 civil case against blinder 
and his brokerage and chastised the sec for misconduct 
company attorneys have contended that the government had a 
vendetta against the firm and blinder said negative publicity 
devastated business in 1988 
blinder began its business in westbury long island ny and 
moved its headquarters to denver in the late 1970s

thinks talks wednesday with boeing co will resolve differences 
over some changes the netherlands and three other european nations 
want made in boeing 747400 jetliners 
boeing spokesmen remained mum on the discussions in seattle 
except to confirm they had started 
but henrik wolleswinkel leader of the dutch negotiators meeting 
with boeing and of the european team that will certify the new jet 
was optimistic about the talks 
in an interview with the seattle times before the discussions 
began wolleswinkel said he believes a temporary operating permit 
might be issued and that the european agencies might give boeing 
one to three years to modify the plane to their standards 
regulatory agencies in the netherlands france britain and west 
germany have asked boeing to modify the design of floor beams 
supporting the new jets upper decks and to provide better 
separation of some electrical circuits the four agencies form the 
joint airworthiness requirements committee 
dutch transport ministry spokesman harald hameleers has 
characterized the changes as minor we think the 747400 is a 
safe plane but there is always room for improvement he said 
boeing spokesman david jimenez said the aircraft maker was not 
commenting on the issues raised by the europeans were keeping 
that for the table he said but we are confident that these 
discussions will lead to approval 
the dutch are taking a lead role in the issue and 
representatives of the other european agencies have said the 
netherlands speaks in the name of all four 
on thursday klm royal dutch airlines is to become the first 
european carrier to take delivery of a 747400 the europeans 
objections have called that delivery date into question but 
wolleswinkel said he expects the plane to fly to amsterdam as 
scheduled 
he also said a temporary operating permit might be issued to 
allow the plane to enter commercial service 
the 747400 which boeing began delivering earlier this year is 
the worlds largest passenger aircraft capable of carrying 412 
passengers more than 8000 miles

a study concluding that changes in procurement 
and tax policy hurt the defense industrys profits was based on 
erroneous assumptions a congressional investigative agency said 
wednesday 
the general accounting office found that the conclusions reached 
by the mac group a bostonbased consulting firm that reviewed the 
financial effects of policy changes implemented from 1984 to 1987 
cannot be validated for the defense industry as a whole 
in its 1988 study the mac group analyzed data on one weapon 
program considered representative of nine anonymous defense 
contractors the study concluded that the changes would result in a 
23 percent reduction in profits for defense contractors additional 
financing requirements of 85 billion for the nine contractors 
and a smaller return on their investment than is necessary to 
preserve shareholder value 
the study was funded by the aerospace industries association of 
america the electronic industries association and the national 
security industrial association whose members include defense 
contractors 
the gao investigationy requested by rep charles e bennett 
dfla found that available public data and policy changes made 
after the study if projected to the entire defense industry did 
not support the mac groups conclusions 
the mac study seeks to show the impact of policy actions but 
it did not ascertain the industrywide level of profitability of 
contractors either before or after these policy changes the gao 
said 
bennett said in a statement that the gao study shows that 
defense contractors have been talking poor but not showing us how 
much profits are in their pockets 
last year the big defense companies hired some experts to 
prove that defense contractors were hurting now we know that their 
experts didnt prove anything he said 
bennett the second ranking democrat on the house armed services 
committee sponsored an amendment last year on profit issues that 
was partly included in the fiscal 1989 defense authorization bill

the air force is reviewing a recommendation 
that it cancel a 204 million contract for radar warning receivers 
for f16 aircraft because the company obtained confidential 
information about its competitors product a spokesman said 
wednesday 
the general accounting office a congressional watchdog agency 
recommended this week that the air force terminate its dec 20 
contract with loral systems manufacturing co for 19 advanced 
radar warning receivers the agency cited information from 
documents released in the investigation of alleged pentagon fraud 
and corruption in its procurement of weapons 
litton systems inc a competitor with loral for the contract 
had filed a protest after documents from operation ill wind 
alleged that william galvin a defense consultant obtained 
information on littons proposal from victor cohen the deputy for 
tactical systems in the office of the assistant secretary of the 
air force for acquisition 
the contract awarded 204 million to loral for the 19 
receivers but had options that could lead to the production of 673 
additional receivers for a total of 188 million 
major donna pastor an air force spokeswoman said the service 
is reviewing the gao decision in the interim the air force has 
taken steps to preclude the obligation of any additional funds on 
the contract beyond the 204 million pastor said 
we wont exercise any production options until the service 
completes its review she said 
the air force has until january 1990 to decide on whether to go 
ahead on one of the production options with loral but pastor said 
the service would decide on the gao recommendation well before that 
the air force can accept the agencys recommendation ask it to 
reconsider the decision or reject it outright if it rejects the 
decision the service must inform the gao within 60 days 
the documents unsealed dec 27 alleged that galvin who served 
as a consultant for loral and litton obtained information from 
cohen about littons proposal and passed it on to loral 
whether or not the air force official was involved in the 
actual release the record establishes that procurement sensitive 
documents in the air forces possession concerning littons product 
were obtained by loral the gao said 
the air force argued that even if the allegations are true it 
would be difficult to conclude that loral took advantage of the 
improperly acquired information according to the gao 
no charges have been filed against galvin or cohen galvin has 
been suspended from dealings with the pentagon while cohen remains 
in his post at the air force however he is no longer involved in 
the awarding of contracts pastor said

the house interior committee on wednesday 
unanimously passed a resolution calling on the exxon corp to pay 
all expenses surrounding the oil spill in alaska 
the resolution which now goes to the full house says that 
exxon and the alyeska pipeline service co have failed to keep 
their promises and assurances to the congress and the american 
people that they could operate the pipeline in an environmentally 
safe way 
the measure gives exxon until sept 15 to cleanup the mess 
created march 24 when the exxon valdez tanker ran aground and 
disgorged 10 million gallons of crude oil into the sound 
it also says that exxon should devote whatever resources are 
necessary 
coast guard spokesman jack odell emphasized that it was a 
proposal and said his agency wouldnt have any response to boxers 
comments until thursday and pay all expenses required to 
compensate affected parties expeditiously 
the coast guard and alaska state officials along with federal 
officials and the people who were directly affected by the spill 
are to be the ones to determine whether the cleanup is complete 
the measure says 
since the spill the oil has moved more than 550 miles along the 
alaska coastline killing thousands of sea otters migratory birds 
and other fish and wildlife 
the result has been devastating to subsistence lifestyle of the 
alaska natives and to the commercial fishing industry the 
resolution states 
exxon has repeatedly taken full responsibility for the oil spill 
and has been paying the costs of the cleanup 
in other action related to oil rep barbara boxer dcalif on 
wednesday called on the coast guard to hold public hearings before 
it changes rules about oil tanker traffic zones off the west coast 
she said the coast guard bowed to pressure from the bureau 
of minerals management which wants more oil development off the 
california coast by decreasing the proposed distance allowed 
between ship traffic lanes and oil rigs 
in 1982 the coast guard had recommended a 5mile free zone 
around rigs for 180 miles of the coast from ano nuevo to santa 
barbara calif boxer said 
she said the coast guard now is considering two onemile traffic 
lanes separated by a twomile corridor in which rigs could be built

the government should create an insurance 
program to cover the millions of people who cant afford private 
policies to provide nursing home care witnesses told a house panel 
wednesday 
the hearing of the ways and means health subcommittee ostensibly 
was on a measure by rep pete stark dcalif the panel chairman 
to set minimum federal standards for the emerging market in nursing 
home insurance policies 
but the witnesses who supported such a measure said what is 
needed even more is a federal plan to guarantee nursing home care 
for all americans regardless of their income 
that proposition has wide sentimental support in congress but 
few members are willing to step forward with a concrete to way 
raise the estimated 40 billion a year such a program would cost 
custodial nursing home coverage was left out of the catastrophic 
illness act that took effect jan 1 
stark a major architect of the catastrophic coverage bill 
introduced nursing home legislation with a 40 billion price tag 
last year but it went nowhere 
testifying in support of starks private regulation bill 
gwendolyn m bedford a board member of the 30millionmember 
american association of retired persons said aarp strongly 
supports federal minimum standards for longterm care insurance 
but she went on to add we believe that it is essential for 
the federal government to play a much stronger role in financing 
longterm care there is a need for a comprehensive public 
longterm care program based on the principles of social insurance 
and shared risk 
that position was echoed by gail shearer manager of policy 
analysis for consumers union which last year published in its 
advertisingfree magazine consumer reports a survey of 53 
private longterm care policies and found most very expensive 
severely limited in their coverage or both 
we note that we prefer either a social insurance longterm 
care program or governmentadministered optional longterm care 
insurance ms shearer told the panel 
while supporting regulation in the short term she told stark 
that consumers union wants to work with him on legislation to 
address the larger longterm care problem extending care to low 
and moderate income americans 
ms bedford of phoenix ariz went outside her prepared 
testimony under questioning from stark to explain in personal terms 
why aarps support for private insurance regulation is only a 
stopgap position 
im two years away from 80 she said i cannot possibly 
afford this private coverage in any way shape form or fashion 
there is no way

us automakers will have to improve fuel economy 
to 275 miles per gallon on 1990 passenger models transportation 
secretary samuel skinner said wednesday 
im hopeful this will be an incentive to auto makers to 
explore better ways to develop better engines and get better 
mileage skinner said at a news conference after a speech to the 
chicago association of commerce and industry 
weve got to get beyond where we are today in miles per 
gallon if were going to deal with this energy crisis he said 
the united states is importing more than 8 million barrels of oil a 
day for the first time since the 1970s 
the new standard will be 1 mile per gallon more efficient than 
the current 265 milepergallon level for 1989 models set by the 
department of transportation and 15 miles per gallon higher than 
the standard in the three previous model years the department said 
in a news release 
it was 1975 when congress passed the energy policy and 
conservation act giving the transportation department authority to 
set the corporate average fuel economy standard for passenger 
cars sold in the united states 
the standard known as the cafe is the average fuel economy 
measured over the automakers entire fleets 
although the standard is tough ford will comply said 
donald r buist a spokesman for ford motor co in dearborn mich 
for the longer term alternative ways of measuring fueleconomy 
progress should be considered 
william noack a spokesman for general motors corp in 
washington dc said cafe is a misguided regulatory program that 
doesnt save energy but does endanger us jobs by restricting 
the number of familysize americanmade cars manufacturers can 
produce 
we will of course do all we can do to meet the requirements 
even though it is hard to understand why there is such a law 
that is harmful to us fullline manufacturers and therefore to 
us jobs 
noack said cafe makes larger cars less available giving 
consumers one of three options keep their less fuelefficient 
cars buy trucks or vans also less fuel efficient but not covered 
by cafe or buy larger cars made by foreign manufacturers 
though foreignmade cars sold in the united states are governed 
by the cafe standard most foreign manufacturers have accrued 
credits under the program by marketing highly fuelefficient cars 
in past years and can now sell bigger cars without penalty he said 
ben dunn a spokesman with chrysler motors in highland park 
mich said chrysler did not take a position on the petition to 
roll back the 1990 cafe standards because the company has always 
met the standard chrysler sells a larger proportion of small cars 
and has higher fuel economy when averaged over its fleet 
if automakers fail to comply with the cafe standard they would 
incur hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in fines so 
the statute enforces itself skinner said 
the secretary who was in chicago as part of national 
transportation week observances said he could not estimate how 
much of a saving in fuel the new standard would produce nationally 
bob marx a spokesman at skinners office in washington said 
the figures were not immediately available

through european countries for delivery to bulgaria typically 
the procuring agent on behalf of the whole soviet bloc said 
keith prager head of the investigative team codenamed miami 
exodus group 
customs undercover investigation began 13 months ago and has 
received information on the export of tens of millions of dollars 
worth of computer equipment by the ring in the past three or four 
years sheehan said 
this network of smugglers has been involved in a phenomenal 
amount of hightechnology smuggling he said this particular 
network has been a main supplier an enormous supplier of hightech 
equipment to eastern bloc countries 
in addition to romania and hungary the network made shipments 
to or through libya iran iraq yugoslavia austria and belgium

applications he said 
the machines were to have been taken to houston for shipment to 
europe then to turkey and finally bulgaria prager said the final 
destination and intended use were not known 
customs began its undercover investigation 13 months ago and 
has received information on the export of tens of millions of 
dollars worth of computer equipment in the past three or four 
years sheehan said 
the soviet union and other communist countries have sought 
western computer gear rather than develop their own he said 
theyre willing to pay two three four 10 times as much as 
the technology is worth simply because it will save them 100 times 
that amount in research and development the spokesman said 
steve smylie and his wife carole who were arrested in houston

security curbs will be lifted soon on 
purchases by this countrys allies of us goods worth about 20 
billion a year a commerce department official said wednesday 
the object of the licensing is to prevent strategic items from 
falling into the hands of the soviets or terrorist groups 
james m lemunyon deputy assistant secretary for export 
administration said some of the allies are considering lifting 
similar restrictions on trade among them he reported that 
representatives of several governments recently told him they 
wanted to follow the us lead although he declined to name the 
countries 
lemunyon was referring to goods traded among the 16 member 
countries of the coordinating committee on export controls a 
publicityshy body known as cocom headquartered in paris it 
includes japan and all the countries in the north atlantic treaty 
organization except iceland 
lemunyon said last year the united states required 96000 
licenses for exports to these countries of goods worth about 100 
billion a new regulation will cut down the kinds of technology for 
which licenses are required 
about 20000 licenses will be eliminated by this one 
regulation he said 
lemunyon would not give a precise date for when the new 
regulation will go into effect but said that in order to get it 
out sooner he was delaying consideration of one provision that 
would eliminate additional licenses 
lemunyon spoke at a meeting called by the aspen institute a 
private policy study group held in a committee room of the house 
of representatives 
among the speakers urging relaxation of export restrictions was 
rep sam gejdenson dconn the new chairman of the subcommittee on 
international economic policy of the house foreign affairs 
committee 
we have a real opportunity for a change in export controls 
he said 
gejdenson suggested that since the soviets have withdrawn their 
forces from afghanistan its time to lift the restrictions former 
president carter imposed on exports to the soviet union when its 
troops marched into that country nearly 10 years ago 
gejdenson predicted that president bush will take a more 
personal interest in export controls than did former president 
reagan and said that would lessen what he called the lopsided 
control by the defense department under reagan the departments 
of defense and commerce frequently clashed on what exports should 
or should not be exported to the allies 
one major change under the bush administration has been the 
departure of richard perle an assistant secretary of defense who 
is a strong advocate of limiting shipments 
mitchell b wallerstein of the national research council an 
official government advisory body said in 180 instances either 
reagan or a top aide had to make a decision on issuing a license 
that was no way to run a railroad he commented 
harlan cleveland a former us ambassador to nato presented a 
report urging further paring of which items need a license for 
shipment to cocom members the object is to focus attention on 
items considered most important to deny to the soviets 
we need higher fences around fewer products he said

northrop corp will cut up to 3000 jobs or 
about 7 percent of its workforce by years end the maker of the 
b2 stealth bomber disclosed wednesday 
the aerospace company is restructuring its corporate staff and 
reducing support staff as its research and development projects 
move into production chairman and chief executive officer thomas 
v jones told shareholders at the companys annual meeting 
we expect to be able to decrease our overall employment 
requirements by 6 to 7 percent or about 2500 to 3000 positions 
between now and the end of the year he said 
jones did not say whether the jobs would be cut through layoffs 
or attrition a call to northrops office here after hours went 
unanswered wednesday 
jones also expressed satisfaction with northrops commitment to 
build 132 b2 bombers for the military 
revenue generated from the b2 stealth bomber amounted to 657 
million or about half the companys overall sales for the first 
quarter according to a letter to shareholders 
the disclosure marked the first time the firm has revealed how 
much it has made from the bomber the sales figure was almost 
exactly what most analysts had been estimating since northrop began 
the b2 program in 1981 
in the first quarter the company reported profits of 97 
million on sales of 128 billion with profits of 97 million 
down sharply from a year ago when profits totaled 1396 million on 
sales of 137 billion 
northrop failed to disclose stealth sales figures for the first 
quarter of last year saying that information remained classified 
by the air force 
but wolfgang demisch an analyst at ubs securities said that 
sales on the bomber appear to be declining
