a new study suggests that women under 45 who 
use birth control pills face a greater risk of breast cancer a 
finding that contradicts earlier research 
the study results were being presented today at a hearing of the 
food and drug administration 
researchers at the boston university school of medicine found 
that women who used oral contraceptives had twice the risk of breast 
cancer compared to women who have never used the pill 
for women who have used the pill for 10 years or more the study 
found the risk of breast cancer was four times greater 
the issue is of particular concern because oral contraceptives 
are the most popular form of birth control in the united states and 
breast cancer is the second most common fatal cancer in women 
an estimated 132 million american women take birth control 
pills according to the alan guttmacher institute which specializes 
in reproductive biology 
about 42000 women die of breast cancer each year according to 
the american cancer society 
the boston university findings were based on a study of 407 women 
with breast cancer and a cancerfree control group of 424 all were 
patients in hospitals in boston new york philadelphia and 
baltimore 
dr samuel shapiro director of the slone epidemiology unit at 
boston university said in a news release the new study contradicts 
findings in earlier studies which indicated there was no 
association between use of the pill and development of breast cancer 
whereas early studies including our own were reassuring about 
the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of breast cancer recent 
studies reopen the question but do not by any means answer it 
said shapiro 
the effect of the new findings the researchers said is to show 
that further studies are needed to reconcile the different 
findings and to overcome the methodologic limitations of earlier 
ones 
a recent study by dr clifford r kay and philip c hannaford of 
manchester england found no overall increase in breast cancer 
among women who had taken birth control pills but did find a 
threefold increase in breast cancers in women 30 to 34 years old who 
were former pill users there was no elevation in breast cancer 
rates among women who were younger or older than this group 
the boston university researchers said it is possible the results 
of their study were biased and the association between oral 
contraceptives and breast cancer may not be one of cause and 
effect 
further details of the study were to be revealed at the fda 
hearing and will be published next month in the american journal of 
epidemiology 
oral contraceptives are pills that generally contain a 
combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin usually taken 
daily for three weeks the pills prevent conception by inhibiting 
ovulation 
in recent years the amount of hormone in each pill has generally 
been reduced as researchers learned that higher doses were unneeded 
to prevent conception 
side effects some of them serious have been experienced among 
some women taking the pill but the accepted medical practice now is 
to prescribe the pill for healthy women until the age of 35 women 
over that age particularly smokers who have used the pill for more 
than five years are known to be at greater risk for heart attack and 
stroke

milwaukee is rolling out the guillotine new york is 
showing what welldressed nobility wore to the dungeon in 1789 and 
dozens of other american cities are planning hundreds of events to 
celebrate the bicentennial of the french revolution 
americans love a party they love a bicentennial and they love 
france the french revolution is a natural said christopher 
henze cultural attache at the us embassy in paris henze is 
keeping track of more than 300 concerts exhibits symposiums 
festivals film series and tv shows taking place across the united 
states in 1989 
birmingham ala alone has an events list nine pages long that 
includes marcel proust at the university of alabama lectures 
wine tastings productions of molieres tartuffe and cooking 
classes by a chef from paris famed le cordon bleu 
the french are enthusiastic about the american revolutionary 
fervor and have decided to send the original declaration of the 
rights of man and citizen to an exhibit at the smithsonian 
institution in washington next spring it will be the first time 
frances most precious document has been on display anywhere since 
it was locked away in 1791 when it was embodied as the preamble to 
the french constitution 
the declaration was drafted in 1789 by emmanuel sieyes the 
french statesman and clergyman and mirrored the ideas of the 
liberal enlightenment it spoke of the equality of men and the 
inalienable rights to security liberty and property 
the founding document of the french republic will be flown across 
the atlantic on april 18 on another source of french pride the 
supersonic concorde which will be on view for a short while at the 
smithsonians aerospace museum 
that a single small country like france can have itself 
represented by a beautiful jet like the concorde and a document like 
the declaration of the rights of man is incredible said sir 
valentine abdy the smithsonians representative in europe he has 
arranged for a concorde plane to be given to the smithsonian when it 
goes out of service 
french musicians and americans of french ancestry will play on 
the washington mall june 30july 4 at about the time the 
smithsonians new york branch the cooperhewitt museum is 
displaying the best objects from two centuries of french decorative 
art and design 
the 25 million cost of the lart de vivre exhibit is being 
paid by the french comite colbert a group of luxury goods companies 
such as krug champagne and hermes 
cartier jewelry will sparkle in museums in new orleans san diego 
and elsewhere the metropolitan museum of art in new york will show 
fashions from the age of napolean costume from revolution to 
empire artist gustave corbet will be reconsidered at the brooklyn 
museum in an exhibit that will later travel to minneapolis and for 
lovers of the printed word the new york public library will offer 
the revolution in print a collection of books broadsides 
prints posters manuscripts and periodicals many on loan from the 
bibliotheque nationale 
french dancers from the paris opera ballet and other companies 
will pirouette across stages from north carolina to massachusetts 
daniel barenboim will lead the orchestre de paris on a sevencity 
tour including stops in chicago and at new yorks carnegie hall and 
french arias will resound in opera halls in texas california and 
washingon dc 
keyboardist ray charles and saxophonist dexter gordon will swing 
with french jazzmen claude bolling and claude nougaro at carnegie 
hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at 
washingtons kennedy center for the arts chicagos orchestra hall 
and the los angeles universal amphitheatre 
what does jazz have to do with the french revolution 
nothing but its a chance to celebrate the role of the french 
over several decades in giving black american musicians the right to 
work the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated 
audiences said edward tuck who will produce a television show 
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived 
and worked in paris such artists have have included the late 
composers and pianists thelonius monk and bud powell 
tuck who is also president of the frenchamerican foundation 
said the number and variety of us celebrations reflect americas 
awareness that the french revolution was the basis not only for the 
declaration of human rights adopted aug 26 1789 but also for the 
us bill of rights adopted 30 days later 
and that is no coincidence he said ideas ricocheted 
between the great thinkers of our two countries it is the 
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a 
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual 
is born with 
celebrations will crescendo on bastille day july 14 when 200 
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven 
prisoners instead the day marked the beginning of lowerclass 
participation in the revolution which had been led by the 
bourgeoisie middle class against the aristocrats and the clergy 
in milwaukee more than 200000 people are expected to attend a 
fourday festival where food vendors will cook crepes and froglegs 
kabobs to be washed down with champagne or rather american bubbly 
white wine because its cheaper said betsy kohler who is 
coordinating the event 
there will be a mock arc de triomphe constructed as the finish 
line for a midnight run not to mention the everpopular guillotine 
we had one last year and everyone liked it kohler said 
its the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and 
someone else takes their picture also its very nicely painted and 
has the history of the revolution printed on it 
a lot of people are going to learn about the french revolution 
this year

a former janitor serving a 35year prison 
term for a murder that authorities now believe was committed by the 
socalled southside strangler was granted executive clemency 
wednesday 
david vasquez pardon was based in part on the recommendation of 
arlington county commonwealths attorney helen fahey said gov 
gerald l baliles 
vasquez 42 pleaded guilty in 1985 to seconddegree murder in 
the death of washington lawyer carolyn jean hamm of arlington 
vasquez at first confessed to the killing but recanted his 
confession and said he entered the guilty plea to avoid a possible 
capital murder conviction and death sentence 
vasquez has been imprisoned at buckingham correctional center in 
dillwyn 
new evidence a review of existing evidence further 
investigation and analysis by the arlington county police department 
and the fbi national center for the analysis of violent crime 
convinced authorities that the crime was committed by timothy 
spencer who has been convicted of capital murder in the deaths of 
susan tucker of arlington and debbie davis of richmond 
spencers convictions were based on dna tests also known as 
genetic fingerprinting in such tests the molecular structure 
of body fluids and tissues from a crime scene are matched with those 
of the suspect like fingerprints each structure is unique to the 
individual 
after the murder of ms tucker arlington police reconsidered 
whether vasquez murdered ms hamm 
every lead and available scientific process was pursued and 
led to the conclusion that spencer was responsible for the hamm 
murder a news release issued by the governors office said 
ms faheys request for a pardon was reviewed by the virginia 
parole board the secretary of the commonwealths office the 
governors executive staff and baliles the news release said 
vasquez received an absolute pardon which restores his 
constitutional rights and leaves him without a criminal record ms 
fahey had predicted that vasquez would receive a conditional 
pardon which is similar to being paroled from prison

car thefts dropped dramatically after 
the military drummed out hundreds of stickyfingered troops the 
countrys constabulary chief said today 
maj gen ramon montano said the rate of car thefts nationwide 
dropped from 66 per day in march to 15 per day in december 
he linked the plunge to a nononsense campaign in which about 
400 soldiers suspected of having links with car theft rings were 
dismissed 
we eased them out and of course the crimes decreased because 
of this montano said in a television interview and i know that 
this policy of ours is a very big deterrent for others who may be 
prone to commit this crime 
he said that the rate of serious offenses such as murder rape 
and aggravated assault decreased from 17 incidents per 100000 
people in 1987 to 14 per 100000 last year 
however total crime rate including serious crimes went up by 
12 percent from 1987 to 1988 montano said he gave no comparative 
figures 
we in the philippine constabulary are happy because the crime 
rate was controllable last year montano said he said more police 
would help in their drive against criminals 
this together with getting rid of our own misfits and 
scalawags and increasing our crime solution efficiency we hope 
would increase the deterrent effect of our laws

a top bank official says the federal home loan 
bank boards dual role as regulator of the savings industry and 
promoter of home ownership has contributed to the wave of sampl 
failures 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures deposits in commercial banks said wednesday 
the insurance fund for sampls should be independent of the bank board 
the primary goal of the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
which insures deposits up to 100000 is the safety and soundness 
of savings institutions he said 
however the fslics parent the federal home loan bank board is 
also charged with creating or chartering sampls to provide a steady 
flow of mortgage money to home buyers 
theres a basic conflict between those two roles and i think 
its very important that they be separated so that the insurer 
can protect his insurance fund and not allow institutions that 
operate in an unsafe and unsound manner to have insurance seidman 
told reporters at a luncheon to release a 408page fdic report 
deposit insurance for the nineties meeting the challenge 
he recommended a regulatory structure for sampls similar to the 
system for banks the office of the comptroller of the currency an 
arm of the treasury department charters national banks while the 
fdic insures their deposits 
the us league of savings institutions the industrys largest 
trade group has not taken a position on separating the fslic from 
the bank board but its chairman br beeksma said recently the 
question should be considered the bank boards performance as a 
chartering agency may be suffering because it is consumed with the 
problems of the fslic he said 
the fdic which prepared the report for congress also 
recommended placing sampl examiners under the fslic currently the 
examiners work for the regional federal home loan banks which lend 
money to sampls are owned by the industry and are controlled by 
boards composed of sampl executives 
the current system can have the effect of allowing sampls with 
representatives on the regional bank boards to regulate their 
competitors seidman said 
the fdic made no recommendation on how money should be raised to 
pay for the sampl crisis but said it was clear that the federal 
government rather than the sampl industry or banks will have to pay 
most of the 60 billion to 115 billion needed to restore sampls to 
health 
but it said concerns about the federal budget deficit could 
be mitigated by an offbudget financing arrangement in which the 
treasury pays the interest on borrowing to finance the industrys 
rescue 
the treasury department is preparing a recommendation for 
presidentelect bush and the new congress 
meanwhile the fdic rejected proposals to curtail or eliminate 
federal deposit insurance arguing that would increase the danger of 
bank runs 
some scholars say reducing or doing away with the insurance would 
force depositors to pay more attention to how well their 
institutions are run the american bankers association said in a 
statement wednesday that the current practice of protecting even 
depositors with funds in excess of the 100000 insurance limit 
has become a license for abuse by some financial managers 
but seidman said in todays complex world we think the 
depositor both sophisticated and unsophisticated would have great 
difficulty in knowing the condition of their banks on a daytoday 
basis we as bank regulators with thousands of supervisors have 
difficulty in keeping control of banks in terms of their exact 
financial condition

unions representing editorial and other 
employees of the official sudan news agency say they will strike for 
a week starting saturday to protest what they called deteriorating 
standards in the agency 
the five unions said in a statement wednesday that the walkout 
also is to support demands for a stronger administration and removal 
of government control from news story content 
the government divested itself of newspapers after president 
gaafar nimeiri was overthrown in april 1985 but kept control of the 
news agency under the ministry of culture 
nimeiri created suna in 1972 it was generously funded when it 
served as nimeiris mouthpiece but its financing and facilities 
were reduced greatly after 1985 
sudans official radio and television and independent newspapers 
rely heavily on suna for news especially from outside khartoum

eastern europeans searching each others 
stores for bargains in soviet caviar czech auto parts and bulgarian 
sportswear have set off an unprecedented customs war in the 
communist bloc 
the new soviet freedom to travel and relaxations on travel 
throughout much of eastern europe lie behind the easts trade 
skirmishes and new trends in bargain hunting both east and west 
the first salvo was fired by czechoslovakia which on nov 15 
gave its warsaw pact allies only 24 hours notice that it was banning 
the export of 80 consumer items including toilet paper childrens 
clothes cars and car parts bananas and chocolate 
czechoslovak officials explained the sudden action with the need 
to protect their own consumers who are used to a relatively cozy 
standard of living that the prague government is finding harder to 
maintain as the economy stagnates 
east germany whose 17 million citizens frequently journey to 
czechoslovakia as the only nation they can visit without a visa 
swiftly fired back a reply 
on nov 18 it banned the export of items ranging from curtains 
to maps both popular purchases for czechoslovaks crossing into 
east germany 
poland was so enraged by the czechoslovak restrictions that it 
took the unusual step of summoning czechoslovakias ranking consular 
official to the foreign ministry in warsaw to explain the new 
customs restrictions 
poles who have the reputation in eastern europe of being the 
regions greatest black market traders grumbled about fivehour 
delays at the czechoslovak border as guards searched trains for 
hidden supplies of fruit meat and tea that can no longer be taken 
out of the country 
czechoslovakias communist party daily newspaper rude pravo 
noted meanwhile that in the first nine months of 1988 six poles 
four east germans and three hungarians visited czechoslovakia for 
every czech or slovak going to those nations 
the soviet union took a little longer to react to 
czechoslovakias sudden steps waiting until last weekend to 
announce a ban from february on the export of caviar coffee 
childrens clothes and electrical goods 
black market dealers in caviar in vienna say the ban on that 
luxury item may be prompted more by heavy pollution killing 
caviarproducing fish in the caspian sea while polish dealers in 
caviar brought back by polish workers from the soviet union doubt 
the ban will affect their supplies 
the czechoslovak ban seems to have been the main reason for the 
soviet move 
i hope we are taking retaliatory measures said a senior 
soviet economist visiting vienna in december we cant let the 
czechoslovaks just behave like that however much they want to 
protect their market 
in vienna and eastern austria hungarians yearold new freedom 
to travel west as often as they like has spawned dozens of new 
stores touting the video recorders and sophisticated electronic 
goods hungarians love 
on nov 7 when they were supposed to be celebrating the 71st 
anniversary of the 1917 bolshevik revolution 100000 people from 
hungary brought traffic to a complete standstill in vienna 
hungarians spent the equivalent of 500 million in austria last 
year while austrians who have long enjoyed the cheap dental 
services salami and other goods available in hungary dumped the 
equivalent of 300 million in hungary 
other westerners enjoying east bloc plenty are greeks who travel 
to neighboring bulgaria apparently anxious to protect its own 
consumer market from greeks israeli and arab tourists who buy cheap 
dairy products bedding blankets and shoes bulgaria in december 
clamped an export ban on those items and dozens of others 
many of the items that fall under the new east bloc restrictions 
may not seem desirable to the western consumer 
bulgarian vacuum cleaners soviet refrigerators and tea from 
czechoslovakia may seem unlikely prizes but they often compensate 
for shortages at home or can be sold to residents of east bloc 
nations willing to pay double or more for such a consumer prize 
last summer austrian border crossings into czechoslovakia 
hungary and yugoslavia were crowded with east european cars 
mostly east german trabants driven by enterprising poles weighed 
down to the ground with goods to be sold or consumed at home 
even before czechoslovakia formally restricted such traffic it 
drew the ire of the nations border guards 
a line of 50 cars mostly poles returning from vacations in 
yugoslavia waited six hours until 3 am to cross into 
bratislava from austria last august when asked why a czechoslovak 
customs official muttered the bloody poles 
the new freedom to travel also has strained the east blocs 
transport capacaties 
soviets who went on unbridled shopping sprees in pragues 
relatively wellstocked and brightly decorated stores found last 
summer that it would take at leat a bottle of russian vodka to bribe 
their way home on hopelessly overbooked trains 
the daily sleeper between vienna and moscow also is overbooked 
with many soviet travelers returning from the west reserving bunks 
simply to take their overweight imports of videocassettes 
televisions and other western goodies 
the only nation that so far seems unaffected by the east european 
travel boom is romania whose 23 million citizens have scarce 
opportunity to journey abroad 
those who do get out find their extreme shortages at home even 
bread was unavailable in bucharest for a week in july make them 
grateful for the smallest luxury outside 
mmm what a beer beamed a contented romanian visiting 
vienna id forgotten the taste

the head of the food and drug administration 
says the number of applications for new drug approvals is doubling 
every year a pace that threatens to choke the agencys ability to 
pass judgment on them 
we cannot do this with smoke and mirrors fda commissioner 
frank e young on wednesday told a panel of researchers looking for 
ways to speed approval of drugs for treating cancer and aids 
young said the fda is receiving an average of 10 applications 
each month requesting permission to begin clinical trials for a new 
drug the first step in getting the drug approved for prescription 
use by the public the monthly total has doubled every year since 
1984 he said 
unless the agency gets more staff the whole ship is going to 
sink young said after his presentation 
young defended his agencys record against criticism from 
government cancer researchers that the fda is slow in approving new 
drugs that offer hope of prolonging the lives of cancer and aids 
sufferers 
drugs for the desperately ill remain our highest priority 
young said 
certainly there will be honest disagreements and inadvertent 
delays he said but the point i want to make is that we place 
the highest priority on the review of drugs for lifethreatening 
illness 
the fdas review time for 12 important cancer drugs approved in 
recent years averaged just over 10 months he said the only drug so 
far approved for aids patients azt was approved in 107 days he 
said 
new streamlined procedures announced last fall will cut fda 
review time in half he added 
but national cancer institute officials said the fda should be 
more flexible in its requirements and encourage early testing of new 
drugs in children who have cancer and aids 
they also said the fda is too stringent in the proof it requires 
that a proposed new medication extend survival longer than existing 
drugs 
you have to stay away from insisting on such evidence because 
the result is that it rations a therapy said dr samuel broder 
new director of the national cancer institute 
young said the criticism reflects a misperception about fda 
requirements he said effects other than survival are considered 
in approval reviews 
dr louis lasagna chairman of the panel studying how to speed up 
the process said his committee hopes to establish mechanisms to 
mediate the fireworks between the fda and the cancer institute 
because there is so much public pressure regarding aids about 
not wasting time getting treatments to victims we might be able 
to capitalize on that concern to bring about improvements in the 
drug approval process lasagna said 
the panel of nine scientists from leading pharmaceutical and 
biotechnical companies and major universities and laboratories was 
appointed by the presidents cancer panel headed by dr armand 
hammer 
presidentelect bush as chief of the presidential task force on 
regulatory relief last year asked the cancer panel to undertake the 
study 
hammer said that in a meeting tuesday bush repeated his 
commitment to the project 
he was so positive hammer said ive known him for a great 
number of years and ive never known him to be so keen about 
something as he is about that

the new york bureau chief and a producer of a french television 
station were arrested wednesday and charged with trying to check 
fake bombs at kennedy airport and a dutch tv station reported 
smuggling a phony bomb onto a londonbound flight authorities said 
in amsterdam tv station veronica filmed one of its reporters 
carrying an attache case containing the imitation bomb through 
security checkpoints and onto an aircraft at schiphol airport 
considered one of the safest in europe 
in the kennedy airport incident three packages containing bogus 
bombs were left for shipment on parisbound flights at the small 
cargo areas of three international airlines port authority police 
said 
the packages also contained a typed message that read in part 
congratulations you have found our phony bomb made with molding 
clay one alarm clock and wires said pa spokesman armando 
arrastia 
the message was written on the letterhead of the french 
television station tf1 and signed by the stations new york bureau 
chief alain chaillou he said 
bruce frankel 37 a tf1 producer was arrested at 330 pm 
after a twa counter employee became suspicious of a 6inchby8inch 
package frankel wanted to check through to paris arrastia said 
inspecting the package the employee found what appeared to be a 
bomb he said when pa police arrived frankel cried no no its 
a fake and took the bomb apart as the police officer and others 
watched arrastia said 
frankel then told police he had delivered two similar packages to 
the small cargo areas of pan american airlines and air france 
arrastia said 
chaillou turned himself in to police later and both men were 
charged with violating the federal explosives statute said fbi 
agent mary frances lilly 
a package had been accepted at air france at about 2 pm by an 
employee who knew frankel because he often used the airlines to send 
film to the television station in paris said bruce haxthausen an 
air france spokesman 
because of wednesdays incident haxthausen said air france will 
be inspecting every shipment received at a cargo facility rather 
than random inspections of cargoes received from known shippers 
the air france cargo area was evacuated for a brief time after 
authorities were notified about the suspicious package said 
haxthausen 
at the pan am small cargo checkin the package had been accepted 
and was on its way to the xray when the new york port authority 
police walked in and seized the package said alan loflin an 
airline spokesman 
twa spokesman robert blattner said we are very pleased our 
employees were able to use their techniques and just solve the case 
on the spot 
frankel and chaillou were being held at the metropolitan 
correctional center in manhattan lilly said and on thursday were 
to appear before a us magistrate 
alouane jeanterne a documentary producer at tf1 said he learned 
of frankel and chaillous arrests late wednesday when chaillous 
wife cerile called him at the stations new york bureau 
he said he didnt know anything about the airport incident before 
that 
if youre asking me my ethical judgment about it i really 
dont know said jeanterne every reporter has his own way of 
getting things of getting sources of getting to the news i have 
not come to a private opinion yet my own thinking now is what is 
going to happen to chaillou 
he said he did not know if chaillous superiors in paris knew 
anything in advance about the bogus explosives 
the message contained in each of the packages also said we 
are tf1 the largest television network in france and it is with 
due respect and great pleasure that we will tell our 18 million 
viewers who watch our daily newscast at 8 that we found your 
company to be keen and consistent with security matters

that terrorists can pass security checks with relative ease 
the imitation bomb consisted of harmless paste made to resemble a 
plastic explosive of the type thought responsible for the dec 21 
bombing of pan american flight 103 over lockerbie scotland which 
killed 270 people the report said 
reporter gert berg carried the briefcase which also contained a 
portable stereo wired to resemble a detonator onto the aircraft 
he was filmed putting the fake explosive and detonator into the 
case checking his baggage and opening the attache case on the 
aircraft the case was filmed passing through an xray device 
the airline involved was not identified on the program 
a written response by airport police read on the program said

despite several attempts by the associated press

the congressional budget office says slashing 
next years federal deficit is going to be a more formidable job 
than reagan administration officials and aides to presidentelect 
bush realize 
the budget office in a report released wednesday said the 
fiscal 1990 deficit will be 141 billion unless new taxes or 
spending cuts are instituted the reagan administration has 
estimated next years red ink at a more manageable 127 billion 
the numbers presented by the nonpartisan congressional agency 
if accurate would make it even more difficult for bush and congress 
to meet the grammrudman balanced budget laws 1990 deficit target 
of 100 billion 
under that law if the government fails to come within 10 
billion of the deficit target spending cuts are automatically 
triggered in a range of domestic and defense programs until the goal 
is achieved most lawmakers say the resulting reductions in federal 
services would be so unpopular with the public that this path is 
politically unfeasible 
the grammrudman law states that the administrations deficit 
forecast not the one made by cb0 determines whether the 
automatic cuts would be necessary but congress relies on the cbo 
figures as a guideline in its budget work 
both the congress and the president if those projections were 
way off will face the same consequences new house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said of the 
administrations more optimistic forecast 
if cbo is correct bush and lawmakers will have to find 41 
billion in deficit reductions to meet the grammrudman target even 
if the administrations forecast is accurate many legislators have 
said that bushs repeated campaign promises to forego new taxes will 
make it hard to avoid grammrudmans automatic cuts 
on monday 11 days before he leaves office president reagan will 
present congress with a 12 trillion budget for fiscal 1990 which 
begins oct 1 administration officials have said reagan found 
enough savings to produce a 925 billion deficit well within the 
grammrudman goal 
reagan has said if his cuts are made the budget will be balanced 
by 1993 the same year the grammrudman law requires the elimination 
of the deficit the cbo report said however that without savings 
1993 will see 129 billion in red ink 
reagans spending plan is not binding and bush and lawmakers 
will virtually have to start all over again in their efforts to 
forge a 1990 spending blueprint 
last years deficit was 155 billion and cbo thinks it will 
again be that large for fiscal 1989 
the cbo raised its deficit projections from a forecast last 
august by 7 billion for the current fiscal year and 5 billion for 
fiscal 1990 the key reason the cost of shoring up the ailing 
savings and loan industry 
the cbo deficit report was based on projections that the economy 
would continue a slow but steady growth of 22 percent in 1990 and 
1991 and 23 percent in each of the next two years with 
unemployment holding steady inflation increasing slightly next year 
and interest rates gradually declining

the agriculture department says americans seem 
to be eating a bit more each year but are choosier about whats on 
the menu 
a 20year statistical study by the departments economic research 
service found that per capita food consumption overall rose 07 
percent in 1987 to a record level including a 18 percent increase 
in foods from crops while food from animals dropped 03 percent 
analysts said the decline in animal products occurred as a result 
of lower per capita consumption of beef eggs whole milk butter 
lard and edible tallow 
the agency cautioned in the report about taking the figures too 
literally because much of the information is derived from 
farmtomarket statistics and other trade information 
strictly speaking the food disappearance estimates should be 
designated as supplies moving through trade channels for domestic 
consumption the report said however because most foods are 
perishable changes in disappearance presumably are associated with 
changes in actual consumption 
the information is useful as an indicator of trends even if it 
is not a measure of actual consumption or the quantity ingested by 
consumers the report added 
for example the latest review by usda economists said that crop 
food consumption rose 17 percent from 1967 to 1987 compared with a 
35 percent increase in the consumption of animal products 
consumption of foods in most crop categories has risen steadily 
in the last 20 years especially fats and oils vegetable grain 
products and sweeteners the report said use of fruit jumped in 
the mid1980s in contrast americans used less red meat eggs 
fluid milk and cream and animal fats moderating the increase for 
animal products 
of all the meat consumed by americans in 1987 59 percent was red 
meat mainly beef and pork compared with 71 percent in the early 
1970s instead people ate more poultry and fish 
in 1987 for the first time the per capita consumption of 
poultry on a retail weight basis was greater than beef 78 pounds 
per person compared with 73 pounds the report said 
but theres a catch measured on the basis of boneless weight 
americans still ate more beef 69 pounds versus 55 pounds 
that is because poultry at the retail level contains relatively 
more bone than beef does the report said 
per capita consumption of fishery products in 1987 was a record 
154 pounds up 45 percent from 1967 and 21 percent more than in 
1977 
egg consumption in 1987 dropped 23 per cent to a per capita 
average of 249 eggs from 322 in 1967 the alltime record was 403 
eggs in 1945 
in the period of 198587 the united states led the world by 
consuming an average 248 pounds of red meat and poultry per person 
that is a carcass weight equivalent before a slaughtered animal 
is divided into smaller cuts 
australia was second at 230 pounds carcass weight per capita 
followed by argentina and new zealand each at 226 pounds the 
soviet union by comparison averaged 145 pounds per capita 
japan and iceland lead the world in the consumption of fishery 
products in the period of 198284 the typical japanese consumed 
annually an average of 190 pounds of fish and shellfish liveweight 
equivalent more than five times the consumption of the average 
american

the agriculture department says private 
exporters have sold an additional 440000 metric tons of us wheat 
to china at subsidized prices and more corn to the soviet union 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said wednesday the wheat was part of 1 
million tons authorized dec 30 for china under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
under the eep arrangement exporters can sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
the wheat sales equal to about 173 million bushels were 
handled by five companies continental grain co 70000 tons 
cargill inc 270000 tradigrain inc 30000 tradecom inc 
30000 and louis dreyfus corp 40000 
sims said the wheat was sold for january delivery and will carry 
an average subsidy rate of 2264 per ton or about 62 cents per 
bushel 
counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements 
china has 570000 tons still available under the program 
the soviet union bought an additional 250000 tons of corn for 
delivery under a longterm grain agreement with the united states 
that boosted corn sales to the soviets in the 198889 agreement year 
to nearly 102 million tons 
besides the corn the soviets have ordered 370000 tons of wheat 
450000 tons of soybeans and 1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 
500000 tons of grain sorghum for 198889 delivery only the wheat 
has been subsidized 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 440000 tons of 
wheat would be about 161 million bushels the latest corn sales to 
the soviet union would be about 99 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 64 million the corn at 260 per bushel could 
have a farm value of about 26 million

with speculation that the first 
indictments could come soon in the pentagon fraud case new court 
papers provide fresh details on how one private consultant in the 
case allegedly trafficked in valuable department information 
a federal grand jury is meeting today and friday outside 
washington where us attorney henry hudson is spearheading the 
nationwide investigation that began in september 1986 
sharon dibbley hudsons spokeswoman refused to say whether any 
indictments would be handed up this week but one defense attorney 
guessed they could come on friday last november hudson predicted 
indictments could be in hand that month 
dibbley also kept mum about if and when any plea bargaining 
arrangements might be revealed hazeltine corp of long island 
ny has said it is cooperating with the government according to 
company attorney william cummings 
meantime a search warrant unsealed this week in federal court 
painted a vivid picture of the activities of william parkin a 
consultant who made money obtaining information for large defense 
contractors 
among the contractors who paid parkin thousands of dollars were 
hazeltine teledyne electronics of newbury park calif northrop 
corp and unisys 
central to the governments case are allegations that consultants 
bribed defense department employees to secure insider information 
about lucrative multimilliondollar government contracts 
parkin who was employed by the navys joint cruise missile 
project office from 1977 until 1983 used a variety of means to 
obtain information the search warrant says information was 
obtained through telephone intercepts and recorded conversations 
parkins attorney gerard treanor has said that his client is 
confident that he had done nothing wrong parkin is going to be 
found not guilty before a jury he said 
here for example are some of parkins methods for obtaining 
information according to the search warrant 
last february parkin who was paid by northrop sought 
information about figures on how much the navy planned to spend on 
the mediumrange remotely piloted vehicle northrop was interested 
in the contract 
a navy official would not tell parkin but did leave parkin 
alone in the office so that parkin could sneak a look at the 
papers on the desk parkin obtained the numbers 
parkin paid jean uebele a former contract negotiator at the 
cruise missile office where parkin once worked 100 a week for 
information the warrant says 
uebele frequently called for her biweekly checks of 50 the 
paper said sheila wohlfarth then parkins secretary once told 
uebele she was making the checks out to smiths maid service 
occasionally parkin asked uebele for copies of documents 
in one conversation in march 1987 uebele called parkin and 
told him that if he parked his car in her place at the pentagon she 
would put materials in the trunk including all of her instructions 
cost and pricing lists reference books copies of every contract 
and information relating to mcdec the marine corps development 
education center the search warrant said 
uebele retired from her job at the navy last week her office 
said her office did not have a forwarding telephone number and her 
home number was not listed 
mrs wohlfarth parkins secretary was the wife of robert 
wohlfarth a patent attorney with the navy 
in an april 1987 conversation wohlfarth complained to his wife 
that parkin promptly paid the other guys he worked with or they 
called him the implication was that parkin owed wohlfarth for the 
information he had provided the search warrant said 
wohlfarth refused to discuss his relationship referring all 
telephone calls to his attorney neil eggleston who was out of town 
prosecutors said last week they no longer need to keep under seal 
search warrants and affidavits issued in june because theyve 
completed the investigative phase of the case papers have been 
released here and in brooklyn ny but remain under seal in st 
louis minneapolis and los angeles

a libel case brought by tom sellecks father 
will go to trial against a supermarket tabloid which claimed robert 
selleck gave his sons love secrets to the publication the 
state supreme court ruled 
the court on wednesday unanimously upheld a lowercourt ruling 
reinstating robert sellecks libel lawsuit against globe 
international and upholding his status as a private figure which 
makes it easier to win a libel case 
the lawsuit stems from a december 1982 issue of the globe that 
carried the frontpage headline tom sellecks love secrets by 
his father 
the story on an inside page was headlined why tom selleck 
can never be a happy lover 
it said robert selleck had described his son as shy and ill at 
ease with women and quoted the elder selleck as saying toms 
relationships with women in his life are always disappointing 
because hes just not the person they think he should be hes shy 
and sensitive not rough and rugged 
in his lawsuit robert selleck said he had a brief innocuous 
conversation with the writer of the article but denied saying 
anything about his sons relationships with women 
stephen rawson a globe lawyer said we expect to prevail in 
the case eventually robert sellecks attorney did not immediately 
return telephone calls

presidentelect bush was urged today to support 
development of new types of nuclear power plants as a way of slowing 
global warming caused by the greenhouse effect 
research on new types of nuclear reactors is one way to develop 
energy sources that produce no carbon dioxide a principal cause of 
the atmospheric warming said a panel convened by the national 
academy of sciences and two sister organizations 
the academy the national academy of engineering and the national 
institute of medicine made a series of recommendations to the 
presidentelect on the environment aids space and science policy 
in a cover letter to bush the presidents of the three bodies 
said global environmental change must be made more prominent in 
the scientific political and foreign policy agendas of the united 
states 
the letter concentrated on five other points 
since global warming and acid rain are both produced by use of 
fossil fuels efforts to enhance both energy efficiency and 
conservation should be strengthened it added that ways to 
increase use of the cleanest fossil fuels such as natural gas 
should be considered but in the context of their finite 
availability 
immediate assessment of possible responses to rising sea levels 
drought and the northward migration of agricultural zones 
nations that have signed a treaty to reduce emissions that 
destroy the ozone layer should be encouraged to accelerate those 
reductions and aim at a total phaseout these chemical account 
for about a fifth of the expected global warming the environmental 
protection agency already has called for such a phaseout 
strategies are needed to prevent the destruction of tropical 
forests the loss of forests around the world probably adds a fifth 
of the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels the group said an 
area the size of missouri is lost each year according to some 
estimates and if nothing is done there could be no tropical forests 
left early in the next century the panel said 
a substantial investment is needed in groundbased and 
spacebased monitoring of the earth 
leadership by the united states could be a powerful force for 
uniting the nations of the world in a common endeavor vitally 
important to all the academy presidents said 
the report cited predictions of a twotonine degrees fahrenheit 
increase in average temperatures sometime in the next century and 
said while global environmental change cannot be stopped the 
pace of change can be slowed 
production of energy from fossil fuels is the root of several 
of the agents of global environmental change the report said 
the report also recommended reexamining use of wind and solar 
energy to see if recent progress has improved their economic 
feasibility as possible substitutes for fossil fuels in the years 
ahead

brain cells produce a modified version of an 
important muscle protein says a study that may help explain why 
muscular dystrophy causes mental impairment in some people 
scientists have been puzzled about why duchenne muscular 
dystrophy the most common and severe form of the disease leads to 
mental trouble in some but not all of its victims 
duchenne is caused by defects in the gene that tells muscle cells 
how to make a protein called dystrophin the defects can prevent 
dystrophin production leading to progressive weakness and wasting 
of voluntary muscles 
onethird to onehalf of duchenne patients also suffer mild to 
moderate mental impairment according to the muscular dystrophy 
association 
in todays issue of the british journal nature israeli 
scientists working with rodent tissue said they found that brain 
cells make a modified version of dystrophin 
that suggests that the proteinmaking machinery in brain cells 
reads the dystrophin gene differently from the machinery in 
muscle cells said donald wood of the dystrophy association which 
partially financed the research 
if so defects that prevent dystrophin production in muscle may 
not necessarily hinder production of the brains version he said 
so a duchenne patient with normal production of brain dystrophin 
may keep normal intellectual capability while a patient whose 
genetic defect hinders the brains production of dystrophin may 
suffer mental impairment wood explained 
the degree of impairment may depend on whether a patient has no 
brain dystrophin too little or an abnormal form of it wood said 
he stressed the overall concept is only speculation nobody knows 
what role dystrophin plays in the brain he said 
while the study will not immediately help in therapy it 
represents a step forward in our evolution of understanding 
dystrophin he said

the starvation death of a 14yearold boy 
has been ruled a homicide police said wednesday after the boys 
father mother and sisters were hospitalized for malnutrition 
eric charles cottams death was ruled a homicide by dr george e 
hudock jr the luzerne county coroner he said the 5foot10 
teenager had not eaten in at least three weeks and weighed 69 
pounds or 80 pounds less than normal 
district attorney correale f stevens said he will meet thursday 
with investigators to decide whether to file charges 
police called to the home by the teens 39yearold father larry 
cottam an unemployed former minister and found the body at 1155 
am police said 
there was no food in the neat sparsely furnished house

leona 37 and 12yearold sister laura in their beds 
laura and leona cottam were hospitalized in serious condition in 
mercy hospital in wilkesbarre cottam a former seventhday 
adventist minister also was in serious condition said nursing 
supervisor barb jones 
at a news conference after the autopsy wednesday hudock said he 
ruled the death a homicide because he could find no disease that 
could have caused the teens emaciation 
a boy that age of normal mental status would want to eat 
hudock said 
investigators told the wilkesbarre timesleader they believed 
the familys religion figured in the starvation 
larry and leona cottam recently won the right to educate their 
children at home after a twoyear battle with the crestwood school 
district 
neighbors said the cottams were an intensely private couple whose 
children rarely if ever socialized with other neighborhood 
children 
neighbors said the family was too proud to ask for public welfare 
after cottam was fired from his job as a truck driver at norandex 
inc in wilkesbarre in march 
cottam was pastor of four seventhday adventist churches with a 
congregration of about 250 until 1984 when he was transferred to 
pittsburgh the family moved back to nuangola in 1985 after he lost 
his post in pittsburgh 
the cottams were friendly and polite according to neighbors but 
became even more reclusive after they returned and were rarely seen 
outside the home

shhhhhh dont tell the folks the fall 
grades on some report cards at northwestern university might not be 
as good as they look 
that a b c or d might actually be an aminus bminus cminus 
or dminus 
the character on the printer that makes the minus sign was worn 
down to the point that when it hit the paper it didnt make an 
impression university registrar donald gwinn said wednesday 
so no minuses were visible on report cards mailed to 
undergraduates 
gwinn said his office learned about the problem tuesday when the 
new term started and some students complained that their fall 
gradepoint averages did not match the grades printed on the report 
cards 
for example students whose reports cards listed as for every 
fall subject were puzzled when the gradepoint average did not read 
a perfect 40 
they may have had a minus in a class but they couldnt see 
it gwinn said 
new report cards will not be issued but students can get free 
transcripts that show the actual grades he said

wives of crewmen aboard the uss john f 
kennedy said they are worried the carriers homecoming early next 
month might be delayed because the ships planes shot down two 
libyan jets 
why did it have to happen now lesley friedman head of a 
homecoming committee wondered after wednesdays encounter in the 
mediterranean 
my first thought was oh no does that mean theyre going to 
come home later than expected said connie derrick wife of an 
aviation maintenance officer aboard the ship 
everybodys pretty anxious for word anxious and concerned 
said paula boot wife of an electronic communications specialist 
everybodys banding together waiting for the next step 
mrs boot said she heard news reports about the attack when she 
woke up wednesday 
the alarm clock went off and it was the first thing i heard it 
made me sit up straight in bed she said not a great way to 
start the day 
the kennedy and 11 other ships left norfolk on aug 2 for a 
sixmonth deployment family members already have been making plans 
to welcome the ships home early next month although an exact date 
will not be announced until about 10 days before arrival 
on the kennedys last cruise to the mediterranean in 1987 its 
return to norfolk was delayed about two weeks because of tensions in 
the middle east 
im so afraid that thats going to happen again said mrs 
friedman whose husband is a weapons officer on the ship 
after worrying the ship might be delayed the wives said they got 
scared for their husbands safety in the middle east 
i dont trust those people i dont trust the iranians and the 
libyans i put them all in one group mrs friedman said 
ive just been praying about it mrs derrick said i think 
the men must feel good about what theyre doing on the ship because 
thats what theyre trained to do its probably frightening for 
them on the other hand it must make them feel good 
the navys newest carrier the theodore roosevelt left norfolk 
last week to replace the kennedy in the mediterranean the wives and 
navy spokesman said they had no indication the kennedys return 
would be delayed 
defense secretary frank carlucci said two f14s from the kennedy 
shot down the libyan jets because the american aircraft were 
threatened while conducting routine operations in international 
waters no americans were injured 
the navy has no plans to release the names of the fliers involved 
in the attack said lt cmdr jim kudla a navy spokesman in

prosecutors concede they are a long way from 
bringing gen manuel antonio noriega to trial on drug charges 
despite a federal judges decision to uphold the prosecution of the 
panamanian leader 
but they called his hold on power tenuous and expressed hope he 
could eventually be overthrown and extradited 
he seized power by the sword and there is no reason to believe 
he might not lose power by the sword said us attorney dexter 
lehtinen well try to get noriega here 
us district judge william hoeveler on wednesday rejected a 
defense challenge to the charges that accuse noriega and 15 others 
of allowing smugglers to use panama as a weigh station for 
usbound cocaine 
noriega allegedly accepted a 46 million bribe from colombias 
medellin cartel to protect the drug traffickers allow them to 
process cocaine and launder their profits according to the february 
indictment a separate federal grand jury indictment in tampa 
charged noriega with three marijuana importation counts 
defense attorney neal sonnett argued that the united states has 
recognized noriega as de facto head of state in panama therefore 
conferring immunity upon him 
we have this material this poison being sent to us the 
judge said to countenance sovereign immunity under these 
particular circumstances would be a serious error 
hoeveler took note of a us state departments affidavit saying 
the government continues to recognize ousted president eric arturo 
delvalle not noriega as legal ruler of panama 
the judge added that he himself had come to a similar conclusion 
in a civil case disputing control of panamas national airline 
facilities here 
sonnett shrugged off the defeat and indicated he may not even 
have standing to appeal the decision 
motions to dismiss are rarely granted sonnett said i 
certainly recognize the difficult burden of proof we had 
the judge refused to rule on two other issues raised by noriegas 
defense sonnett had argued noriega was being selectively prosecuted 
to force him into concessions on control of the panama canal which 
is to be turned over to the panamanian government at the end of the 
century 
sonnett also argued that pretrial publicity would make it 
impossible to find an objective jury 
the judge said wednesday that those issues would have to wait 
until the case was ready to go to trial which both sides 
interpreted to mean when noriega was extradited to the united states 
chief deputy assistant us attorney richard gregorie who 
presented the case to the grand jury and was making his final 
appearance as a prosecutor before going into private practice said 
he was pleased by hoevelers ruling 
now weve got to see who will bring him back gregorie said 
about 30 panamanian exiles in the courtroom audience crowded 
around gregorie to shake his hand after the ruling and later 
outside the courthouse cheered the announcement of hoevelers 
decision 
following the indictment the united states declared an economic 
blockade of panama and worked openly with the countrys domestic 
opposition to depose noriega but the effort failed at one point 
over the objections of miami prosecutors the united states offered 
to drop the indictment if noriega would leave power

a pregnant womans decision to go out on a 
limb literally has prompted utility company officials to 
reconsider their program of cutting down and trimming neighborhood 
trees 
i dont normally do this kind of thing but i just wanted to 
try to get some attention about this susie daugherty said 
wednesday as she sat in a tree near her yard perched on a limb 
already trimmed by the public service co of oklahoma 
i just wanted to slow this down it seems like they were flying 
through the neighborhood wiping out trees 
the trees which are on cityowned land were cut or trimmed only 
after receiving permission from adjacent property owners utility 
spokesman brian miller said other residents such as ms daugherty 
were not consulted 
the company decided shortly after noon wednesday to discontinue 
the trimming in ms daughertys neighborhood until they are able to 
meet with residents to discuss the program miller said 
the program targets diseased trees near power lines that likely 
would fall in a storm he said six trees already had been cut or 
trimmed he said 
ms daugherty who is four months pregnant said she climbed in 
the tree because she noticed so many were being cut down she ended 
her protest about two hours later after hearing of the decision to 
halt the trimming 
it takes years and years and years for these trees to grow if 
we just go around chopping them down what are we going to have

treaty banning chemical weapons use and dumas said he hoped 
wednesdays episode would not dominate it president reagan said 
last month his advisors were considering a military strike on the 
rabta plant but the washington post today quoted senior 
administration officials as saying he now opposes attacking the 
plant because washingtons european allies are against the idea 
the italian government expressed deep concern about 
wednesdays incident 
we believe that the situation in the mediterranean area imposes 
on everybody the obligation to be moderate and to renounce any act 
of violence which may cause a further use of military strength 
said a government spokesman who commented on condition of anonymity 
in spain foreign ministry spokesman juan lena said the 
spanish government considers with serious concern any kind of 
measure that leads to an increase in tension in the mediterranean 
about 3000 leftist greek demonstrators marched to the us 
embassy in athens shouting antius slogans and a government 
spokesman said greece believes both sides at this moment should 
cool it and avoid actions that would endanger peace in this 
sensitive region 
arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi demanded washington 
end acts of provocation near the libyan coasts 
in tunisia which borders libya he said the attack amounted to 
an extremely serious aggression dictated by a false perception 
by the united states of its role in regulating international 
problems klibi said any escalation would have negative 
consequences on usarab relations 
in syria staterun television called it flagrant us 
aggression 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
told cable news network in an interview from cairo egypt it will 
affect negatively the middle east peace process he termed the 
incident very serious 
the few kind words came mainly from jerusalem 
finance minister shimon peres of israel said we congratulate 
the american navy for shooting down two planes that were threatening 
it 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner said 
based on previous libyan behavior we have no reason to doubt the 
official american explanation of this incident 
benjamin netanyahu the deputy foreign minister told parliament 
that israel has evidence libya is capable of producing chemical arms

welcome to dirty bird hospital like 
televisions st elsewhere the accommodations arent much but the 
care is great 
ocean shores convention center the seaside hall usually teeming 
with conventioneers and banquets has been redubbed oil spill 
command center in the wake of one of the pacific northwests worst 
oil spills 
the focal point is dirty bird hospital thousands of oilsoaked 
sea birds get tender loving care and rest in the wards of the 
makeshift veterinary hospital complex staffed by hundreds of 
volunteers 
alice berkner a vancouver wash bird expert who heads the 
effort is a gracious if exhausted host to visitors including 
gov booth gardner who stopped by wednesday 
she said more volunteers are needed to augment the effort and to 
relieve some of those now working more than 1000 have helped out 
this is not some emotional commitment to help the poor little 
birdies she said its more a matter of we made the mess and 
lets clean it up and develop a technology for heading this off 
more than 3200 birds are known to have died since a tug and a 
barge collided dec 22 off grays harbor near here causing a spill 
estimated at up to 231000 gallons gobs of heavy bunker oil have 
dirtied more than 300 miles of coast from oregon to british columbia 
an estimated 5200 birds wound up at dirty bird hospital and 
2700 lived according to don kane of the us fish and wildlife 
service smaller cleanup operations were set up at astoria ore 
and neah bay 
the barges owners sause bros ocean towing of coos bay ore 
has agreed to pay for the cleanup including the 50000 spent on 
dirty bird hospital and other command center operations no estimate 
has been made on the overall cost 
following berkners design the massive convention hall has been 
transformed into hospital wards and stations 
a visitors first stop is the pens where the newly received birds 
are housed huddled black with oily goo the birds show little 
spark of life as they sleep or stare blankly from bedsheets atop 
crumpled newspapers 
volunteers tubefeed the birds pass out raw fish four times a 
day and try to help the birds regain their strength 
from the pens birds are carried to the washing room where they 
get three or four warm soapy baths one volunteer holds and the 
other scrubs sometimes using a toothbrush most of the oil comes 
off with one good washing but the additional baths are necessary to 
take off the rest 
then comes a vigorous long rinse the process the birds seem to 
resent most 
its all traumatic to these birds said berkner pointing to 
one protesting murre she shook her head and said it probably 
thinks its about to be eaten that its under attack its all a 
shock getting oiled was a shock 
after drying and recovering a bit the seabirds are placed in a 
flotation pond to check their buoyancy and wing action if they 
sink theyre washed and rinsed again 
some of the birds dont make it through the cleaning 
you cant imagine what it feels like to be washing a precious 
little bird and then having it die right in your hands one woman 
said 
the survivors will be released far from their normal habitat so 
they wont run the risk of being oiled again twentyseven have been 
released so far according to kane 
thats the best part said berkner she said her crews would 
try to get the birds through the cleaning process as soon as 
possible 
these are wild animials certainly the longer theyre here the 
harder it is on them she said

a young mother given a second chance to 
raise her child after the babys adoptive parents were shot to death 
a few feet from his crib says shes now ready for motherhood because 
ive grown up a lot 
ive been feeding him changing him clothing him and bathing 
him tracy medeiros said wednesday a day after she successfully 
convinced a marin county court she was ready for such responsibility 
and was awarded custody of the toddler 
ive never been a mom before im getting used to it hes real 
happy she said as she prepared to fly home to massachusetts today 
medeiros gave travis up for adoption nine months ago in hopes his 
new parents would provide the security and comforts she feared she 
couldnt after her boyfriend left her at 17 she felt it was the 
right thing to do 
but that decision was turned upside down last month when travis 
adoptive parents william and tasia stephens were shot to death a 
few feet from the babys crib at their home in novato about 25 
miles north of san francisco 
the stephenses housekeeper and her boyfriend were arraigned 
wednesday on charges of murder and pleaded innocent yolanda segura 
and zohelin diaz both 25yearold illegal aliens from guatemala 
face a possible death sentence if convicted a preliminary hearing 
was set for april 5 
novato police believe the shooting occurred after segura told her 
boyfriend she had been sexually assaulted at the home of the slain 
couple the san francisco chronicle reported today 
segura however may have been fired by the couple and 
investigators think she may have told diaz the story to cover up the 
loss of the job the newspaper reported without citing sources 
on tuesday superior court juvenile commissioner sylvia shapiro 
ruled that the adoption arranged before travis birth had not been 
legally finalized thereby paving the way for medeiros to return 
with the baby to her mothers home in billerica mass 
now i know im ready ive grown up a lot medeiros 18 said 
afterward 
shapiro required medeiros to take parenting classes and make 
monthly reports to the court about the childs welfare the reports 
will be shared with relatives of the slain couple who also applied 
for custody of the child and the case will be reviewed in six 
months 
but medeiros isnt worried about that now 
i just care about my son she said nothing else bothers 
me im going to do whats best for him

a soviet news program promised viewers a story 
about 17 armenian earthquake victims who survived nearly a month 
under a crumbled grain elevator then mysteriously failed to 
broadcast the report 
the story was promoted at the opening of wednesdays vremya 
news show 
seventeen people survived almost a month under the ruins of an 
elevator we expect a report about this announcer anna shatilova 
said at the beginning of the nightly news program which is watched 
by tens of millions of viewers 
the story apparently the same one denied a day earlier by 
soviet officials never materialized 
but in a report about the visit of leningrad communist party 
leader yuri solovyev to the earthquakedevastated city of leninakan 
vremya showed a brief picture of rescue worker sasha ivanov from 
leningrad 
today leningrad resident sasha ivanov who saved the lives of 
17 people as hundreds of his comrades from all corners of the 
soviet union was raising a new leninakan the report said 
it showed ivanov only briefly in a report of several minutes and 
said nothing about when or how he saved the people 
hundreds of people were pulled alive from the wreckage of 
leninakan and other cities following the dec 7 quake concentrated 
in the southern republic of armenia that killed tens of thousands of 
people 
on dec 23 the republics deputy prime minister said authorities 
were calling off the search for survivors and efforts would now 
focus on rebuilding over the objections of residents who opposed 
abandoning the search bulldozers began clearing the rubble 
on monday french and british media reported that 17 people had 
been found in the remains of a bread factory near spitak a village 
in northwestern armenia leveled by the quake 
in paris europe 1 radio quoted a nurse for the french 
humanitarian group doctors of the world as saying the 17 survivors 
were found dec 28 the nurse who spoke on condition of anonymity 
was quoted as saying they stayed alive by eating grain and drinking 
melted snow 
the official tass news agency on tuesday denied the report 
saying the last survivor had been rescued dec 22 
the western press reports have no foundation tass quoted 
norik muradyan chief of rescue operations in the town as saying in 
a telephone interview 
vremya editors could not explain why the teaser at the 
opening of the program was not followed through with a story 
you saw everything on the screen that we received from 
yerevan said the duty editor in charge of the program 
the editor who spoke by telephone with the associated press on 
condition he not be identified said ms shatilovas announcement at 
the beginning of the program could have referred to the report about 
ivanov or that film crews in yerevan perhaps had not had enough 
time to put together a report 
editors at tass in moscow and at the official armenpress news 
agency in armenia said they had no information to verify that 17 
people were rescued from a collapsed elevator 
telephones at government offices and the red cross in yerevan did 
not answer on wednesday night

the chief us diplomat in cuba walked out in 
protest over president fidel castros criticism of the reagan 
administration during a threehour speech honoring the 30th 
anniversary of the cuban revolution 
in his wednesday night speech castro assailed us threats 
against libya for its alleged chemical weapons plant but curiously 
omitted any reference to the us downing of two libyan jet fighters 
earlier in the day over the mediterranean 
castro did say however that the united states has the most 
powerful chemical weapons arsenal in the world then asked why 
should it deny it to other countries cuba is believed not to 
possess chemical weapons 
it was shortly after castro alluded to this that jay taylor who 
has headed the small us mission in havana for slightly over a 
year rose from his seat in the diplomatic section and strided out 
there was no immediate comment from taylor 
meanwhile after months of uncertainty about sovietcuban 
relations castro offered strong praise for moscow while bitterly 
criticizing us policies toward the third world 
tens of thousands of spectators were present as castro inagurated 
a permanent fair designed to highlight achievements in cubas social 
and economic development over the past three decades 
the public was to have access to the pavillions at the fair 
starting today 
in several speeches in recent months castro has made clear his 
unhappiness with the liberal reform policies of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
he has indicated his defiance of gorbachev by affirming cuba will 
never adopt any policy that reeks of capitalism on sunday 
castro said cuba will be guided by a policy of socialism or death 
marxismleninism or death 
although there was never any doubt the sovietcuban axis would 
continue castros emphasis seemed to undergo a revival 
we will never forget the support received from the soviet 
union in decisive moments castro said at another point he 
said we support the policies of peace of the soviet union 
he also said moscow and havana see eyetoeye on the 
international debt issue plaguing many third world countries he 
said that while the united states subjects its trading partners to 
unequal terms of trade the soviet union has treated cuba fairly on 
that same issue 
this was a reference to the soviet purchase of cuban sugar at 
prices above those of the world market and soviet concessions in the 
sale of oil to cuba 
among those attending the speech were president daniel ortega of 
nicaragua and namibian rebel leader sam nujoma 
castro expressed deep concern over a proposal apparently 
strongly supported by the united states for a reduction in the un 
peacekeeping force that will oversee the pending transition of 
namibia to independence from south african colonial rule 
according to nujoma the proposal entails a reduction from 7500 
to 3000 in the un troop presence 
castro said a reduction of that magnitude would play into south 
african hands and jeopardize the possibility of genuine independence 
for namibia 
he suggested a reduced un force would not be able to adequately 
verify the planned withdrawal of south african troops 
south africa agreed to allow namibias independence as part of a 
deal that also calls for the withdrawal of the 50000 cuban troops 
from angola 
castro said the first cuban troops will begin leaving angola next 
tuesday 
under a usbrokered treaty signed dec 22 by angola cuba and 
south africa havana must pull out its first 3000 troops by april 
1 half of them by nov 1 and the rest within 30 months

a star may have died its explosive death inside 
the remnants of an earlier supernova about 40 centuries ago a 
cosmically rare event scientists reported today 
an unusual collection of intertwined filamentlike structures 
near the center of the older supernovas expanding shell may be 
remnants of the second explosion they said 
this is speculative interpretation of the data cautioned 
pf winkler of middlebury college in middlebury vt 
im not persuaded by it said robert fesen of the university 
of colorado in boulder who was familiar with the study 
fesen said it is highly unlikely that two neighboring stars would 
explode at what astronomers consider virtually the same time nobody 
has reported such a double supernova elsewhere he said 
the study of the remains from the puppis a supernova was reported 
in todays issue of the british journal nature winklers coauthors 
were scientists at the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics 
and the cerro tololo interamerican observatory in chile 
a similar hypothesis about puppis a had been raised before they 
wrote 
the new analysis showed that the filaments were made of different 
elements including oxygen and sulfur that could be ejected by an 
exploding star the appearance of the filaments was consistent with 
their being a supernova remnant and their speed approached that 
seen in material ejected from a supernova winkler said 
although other supernova remnants give off xrays and radio 
waves none was observed from the filaments winkler said that 
suggests the filaments could be within the shell of the older 
supernova where the highpressure lowdensity environment would 
prevent the emissions 
perhaps the double supernova resulted from explosions of two 
similar stars that were orbiting each other he said 
fesen said he believes the filaments came from the original 
supernova explosion and that they are a curious feature that 
should be explained in some way

the launch of space shuttle discovery 
and a fiveman crew has been rescheduled for feb 23 five days 
later than planned 
the schedule change does not reflect any technical problem only 
that extra time is needed to prepare discovery for flight lisa 
malone a nasa spokeswoman said wednesday 
however she said that before a launching can occur engineers 
must resolve tile and cracked bearing problems that developed during 
the december flight of the shuttle atlantis officials have said 
they are confident the problems will be resolved in time to meet the 
february launch date 
atlantis suffered severe damage to nearly 200 of the 28000 
thermal tiles that protect it from atmospheric reentry heat and 
when engineers inspected the crafts main engines they found a tiny 
crack in a bearing in a liquid hydrogen pump 
officials believe the tile damage was caused when insulation 
peeled away from the shuttles external fuel tank and solid fuel 
booster rockets during liftoff they think the bearing damage may be 
traced to a flaw in the metal curing process 
the space agency said the current plan is to move discovery into 
an assembly building on jan 19 to be hooked to its fuel tank and 
booster rockets with rollout to the launch pad set for jan 26 
agency managers will meet here feb 8 and 9 to assess the 
readiness of the shuttle for flight liftoff on feb 23 is set for 
830 am est 
navy capt michael l coats will command discovery on the 
fiveday mission during which the astronauts will deploy a 
communications satellite and conduct scientific and technology

secretary of state george p shultz was 
embarking today on a mission to persuade more than 100 nations to 
impose sanctions on countries that use poison gas 
he also planned to urge foreign ministers and ambassadors 
assembling for a fiveday conference in paris to strengthen the hand 
of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in investigating 
allegations of chemical warfare 
the skirmish wednesday over the mediterranean in which us navy 
jet fighters shot down two libyan mig23 planes acted as a backdrop 
for the conference which opens saturday 
william burns director of the us arms control agency 
acknowledged that decisions at the meeting will be by consensus 
this means any nation including libya can block proposals 
i dont know how successful we will be and i dont know how 
much of a resonant chord this will strike in the hearts of other 
participants burns told reporters wednesday at the state 
department 
still burns said shultz will push for sanctions under the 
united nations charter and for additional powers for the un 
secretarygeneral 
the paris conference was proposed by president reagan in 
september to draw international attention to the spreading use of 
chemical weapons the focus then was on iraq which was accused of 
and denied devastating iranian troops and civilians with poison 
gas 
for the last two months however the united states has put 
special stress on libya and a plant at rabta south of tripoli the 
state department claims has recently begun limited production of 
chemical weapons 
even before us jets shot down the libyan fighter planes near 
crete on wednesday the reagan administration had served 
notsosubtle notice to the world that it considers moammar 
gadhafis drive to produce poison gas an allegation the libyan 
leader has consistently denied a serious threat to world stability 
shultz in an interview on the eve of his departure told the 
washington post the administration was raising a big stew over 
the plant because of libyas known connections to terrorist 
groups 
after the clash defense secretary frank c carlucci and other 
senior us officials sought to separate the incident from the 
drumbeat of alarm the reagan administration has sounded over the 
suspected chemical weapons facility 
the libyan plant controversy is bound to have an impact on the 
conference and yet burns said it is not aimed at bashing a 
particular country 
referring to the air clash burns added i dont see it as 
really germane to the conference i think that other nations will 
not see it as germane as well 
carlucci at a news conference at the pentagon said the libyan 
jets had approached the us f14 tomcats at high speed and in a 
hostile manner in international airspace 
he said the navy planes acted solely in selfdefense based on 
preliminary reports the migs activated their radar before the 
tomcats opened fire with airtoair missiles carlucci said 
congressional leaders said the united states had acted 
appropriately but expressed concern that the incident might portend 
further hostilities with libya 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said congress should 
be informed if the united states is engaged in a piecemeal 
escalation of our conflict with libya beyond these legitimate acts 
of selfdefense 
libya meanwhile condemned the us firing as a premeditated 
attack and gadhafi the libyan leader declared his north african 
nation would meet challenge with challenge 
if america has prevailed because it is a superpower in the air 
and the sea it will inevitably be defeated in libya gadhafi 
said we as well as the fish are awaiting them 
european officials reacted cautiously to the incident while 
israel applauded the us action and yasser arafat chairman of the 
palestine liberiation organization and the arab world sharply 
criticized the united states 
the downing of the two libyan jets kept attention fastened on the 
suspected libyan chemical plant as delegates to the paris conference 
began assembling 
shultz who will be in paris through sunday will urge 
industrialized countries to deny technology to other nations bent on 
developing chemical weapons charles e redman the state department 
spokesman said the key to the libyan situation was to deprive 
gadhafi of the equipment material and expertise to produce poison 
gas 
if these kind of things are going to be cut off its going to 
be very difficult for a plant of this kind to operate he said 
the 1925 geneva protocol under review in paris bans the use of 
chemical weapons but does not outlaw their production some 20 
nations by us estimate either have produced chemical weapons or 
are capable of manufacturing them 
the protocol has no enforcement mechanism its effectiveness 
depends on the selfdiscipline of the 130 nations that are parties 
to the pact 
to try to stem proliferation redman said we are prepared to 
discuss the strongest possible measures against countries that 
export sophisticated technology 
the west european governments have responded with some skepticism 
to the us allegations however west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher said wednesday his government had no evidence 
proving west german pharmaceutical firm had helped build the plant 
at rabta a spokesman for genscher said meanwhile bonn had accused 
washington for additional material to back up the allegation 
but the reagan administration has not pulled back 
robert m gates a former cia deputy director who was named last 
week as deputy director of the national security council said in a 
recent speech that the plant was built with the help of nearly a 
dozen nations east and west he declined to name them

the government will scale down annual 
ussouth korean military exercises and may end them in 1990 to 
help reduce tension with communist north korea news reports said 
today 
yonhap the semiofficial national news agency and leading 
newspapers all carried reports that the government was considering 
the future of the team spirit exercises to help promote dialogue 
with its northern foe 
an unidentified government official was quoted by yonhap as 
saying a reduction in the exercise this year would be symbolic 
with troop numbers cut by 10000 troops 
the official was quoted as saying that seoul plans to take up the 
question of ending the annual exercices in 1990 in security talks 
with the united states later this year but a defense ministry 
spokesman who declined to be named in keeping with official 
practice said the reports were not true 
he declined to comment further 
a us military spokesman in seoul said we are aware of the 
press reports but have no information to release at this time 
team spirit usually involves up to 200000 troops including 
reinforcements from the united states one of the exercises 
functions is to practice bringing in reinforcements from the united 
states in the event of a north korean attack 
the united states has about 42000 troops based in the south 
under a mutual defense pact to help prevent a north korean attack 
north korea repeatedly has charged the exercises are preparation 
for war and an obstacle to improving relations between the two 
koreas 
in a new years speech north korean leader kim il sung said the 
south should show its desire to ease tension by ending the exercises 
ho dam member of north koreas political bureau and head of its 
reunification committee urged the south to accept kims request to 
end the military exercises the korean central news agency said in a 
report monitored in tokyo today 
the two koreas split in 1945 have often accused each other of 
heightening tension and blocking reunification of the divided korean 
peninsula north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the bloody 
threeyear korean war

a female whooping crane flying through 
heavy fog with her mate was shot by a hunter the first reported 
killing of the endangered bird in 21 years authorities said 
the crane was killed near the aransas national wildlife refuge 
where it makes its winter home the first such incident anywhere 
since 1968 when another hunter was fined for shooting a crane 
nearby under nearly identical weather conditions refuge manager 
brent giezentanner said wednesday 
the investigation will determine whether the hunter whose name 
was not released shot the crane intentionally or by accident 
giezentanner said 
he said the outoftown hunter and a companion were hunting for 
geese and ducks tuesday in spalding cove stateowned marshland 
south of the wildlife refuge which lies about 45 miles northeast of 
corpus christ along the texas coast 
giezentanner said the shooting may have been accidental but 
added that theres still a lot of difference in a 2foot goose and 
a 5foot crane 
a prudent hunter should have known the difference he said 
the 4yearold female crane was shot as it flew with its mate 
through heavy fog above the cove giezentanner said adding that the 
crane had brought her first chick with her on the southerly 
migration from the wood buffalo national park in northern canada 
the shooting of cranes is not always detected because the 
endangered whoopers are not monitored constantly during their annual 
migration north or south he added 
wildlife refuge officials learned of the shooting after the 
hunter surrendered as occurred in the earlier incident 
the hunter involved in the 1968 shooting was fined 500 the 
maximum penalty then for killing an endangered species under the 
migratory bird treaty act 
under the current endangered species act of 1969 a person 
charged with intentionally killing a member of an endangered species 
faces a oneyear sentence andor a 20000 fine an accidental 
killing carries a maximum sixmonth sentence andor 10000 fine 
authorities said that apart from the 136 adult cranes and chicks 
that made the migration to the aransas refuge this year only 25 
others are known to exist in new mexico and 40 are kept in 
captivity at the us fish and wildlife service center in patuxent 
md 
the whooping crane population has steadily increased since the 
late 1930s when fewer than 20 existed

an amish man who pleaded guilty to a sex 
charge voluntarily entered the county jail without being sentenced 
to have a better chance at being free for the spring planting a 
public defender said 
andy a slabaugh 50 of canton chose to go to jail wednesday 
after pleading guilty to fourthdegree criminal sexual conduct 
rather than wait until after a feb 6 sentencing said the public 
defender thomas manion 
slabaugh was accused of fondling a woman in his buggy and 
threatening to kill her if she told anyone 
manion said slabaugh probably will remain in jail until he is 
sentenced by district court judge clement h snyder 
while state sentencing guidelines allow for wide discretion in 
sentencing for fourthdegree criminal sexual conduct manion said it 
is likely slabaugh will face some jail time because he has been 
convicted of another felony 
last year slabaugh pleaded guilty to bribing a public official 
in a tax incident later citing amish religious opposition to being 
photographed he refused to let jailers take his picture for 
booking the case is under appeal to the us supreme court

the government of president augusto 
pinochet has asked the supreme court to appoint a special judge to 
investigate a secretive german colony accused of human rights abuses 
foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz in an unusual request 
personally asked justice jose maria eyzaguirre on wednesday to 
investigate colonia dignidad a sprawling farm 210 miles south of 
santiago 
government sources said errazuriz made his request after 
receiving an appeal from his west german colleague hansdietrich 
genscher 
the sources said genscher last week requested the chilean 
governments cooperation after lower chilean courts turned down 
two similar requests filed by private chilean lawyers 
the colony near parral was established in the early 1960s by a 
group of west germany free baptists led by paul schaffer a world 
war ii air bomber 
it has about 300 residents most of them germans and has 
developed into a selfsufficient community with modern agricultural 
projects its own hospital and a school that also serves chilean 
peasants in the area 
previous investigations by lower courts produced no results to 
charges the colony physically and psychologically abused its 
residents and the situation has often strained relations between 
chile and west germany 
the colony has been accused by human rights organizations of 
abusing its members and keeping many of them against their will 
several former colony members who fled the enclave have alleged they 
were abused 
organizations such as amnesty international also claimed the 
colony served as a torture and execution center for the chilean 
security services after the 1973 coup that brought pinochet to power 
colony spokesmen deny the charges saying they are part of a 
smear campaign 
about a decade ago colony leaders filed a slander suit in 
frankfurt west germany against the magazine stern and the west 
german chapter of amnesty international for charging the colony 
engaged in torture and executions 
last august parral judge lidia villagran inspected the colony 
and questioned some of its leaders and members at the request of the 
german court handling the suit against stern and amnesty 
international under questioning schaffer denied charges of rights 
abuses 
the colony is offlimits to visitors when reporters attempted to 
cover judge villagrans inspection farmers in the area blocked the 
road to the enclave the group calling themselves friends of 
colonia dignidad photographed the reporters and argued with them 
among officials of the pinochet government known to have visited 
the enclave are defense minister adm patricio carvajal and gen 
rodolfo stange a member of the fourman military junta and head of 
the national police 
it was not immmediately known when the supreme court would act on 
the governments request

animal control officer kim johnsen has 
apprehended this citys first feline felon but she says publicity 
about the chicago suburbs cat leash law makes her out to be just 
what she isnt a cat hater 
weeks of news reports interviews and telephone calls many of 
them hostile preceded the first catnabbing which ms johnsen 
describes as a pretty routine affair 
the cat was sitting in the street and i almost ran it over 
ms johnsen said late wednesday i got out and called to it and 
it came over to me but then it ran off the second time i 
called it came over again and i just picked it up and put it in a 
cage 
the arrest last friday had a happy ending ms johnsen said 
it was a very clean pretty cat an orange tabby 1 to 2 
years old and declawed she said it had its shot tag and an 
identification tag on its collar so i got in touch with the owner 
right away 
he was informed that he had the dubious honor of being the 
first one caught under the new law when he stopped laughing he 
came over and picked up his cat she said 
the owner who asked not to be identified paid a 10 fine a 15 
pound fee and an 8 cat license fee ms johnsen said under the new 
law he could have been fined 200 if there had been public 
complaints about his cat 
publicity was spreading about the naperville cat control 
ordinance even before it took effect dec 2 
i understand stories about the cat law appeared in about 65 
countries and in every part of the united states ms johnsen 
said i was even on a radio talk show from arizona for about 45 
minutes last month i took a lot of flak and a lot of telephone 
calls 
naperville cats must now be inoculated and wear identifying 
collars if they go outdoors and set foot on any street alley or 
other public place they must be on leash 
some people have been calling me the queen of the cathaters 
but thats not at all true said ms johnsen ive got three 
cats of my own at home all neutered and declawed and they dont 
go outside its too dangerous for a cat out there

coping with an economy devastated by 
eight years of war the leftist sandinista government has sharply 
devalued its currency doubled fuel prices and increased bus fares 
200 fold 
wednesdays austerity measures were the second instituted since 
saturday when president daniel ortega announced steep cuts in 
defense and public works spending 
the new measures were published wednesday in the ruling 
sandinista partys newspaper barricada they included a devaluation 
of the cordoba from 920 to 2000 to the dollar on the official 
market which is used for such essential imports as oil 
a parallel exchange rate at which most transactions such as 
paying hotel bills are billed remained 4500 to the dollar on the 
black market the dollar fetches about 5500 cordobas 
urban bus fares mostly used by the working class soared from 
half a cordoba to 100 cordobas or one 9000th of a us cent to a 
little over 2 cents the government heavily subsidizes bus fares 
in addition gasoline prices jumped 120 percent from 1900 
cordobas to 4200 cordobas a gallon or from about 42 cents to about 
95 cents a gallon gasoline is rationed and motorists now receive 
17 gallons a month 
inflation last year topped 20000 percent according to official 
figures 
ortega on saturday announced he was cutting the defense budget by 
29 percent including a 40 percent cut for police and other security 
forces he said government spending on public works projects and 
other essential investments are being reduced this year by 56 
percent 
the government and ussupported contra rebels reached a 
ceasefire agreement march 23 but talks on a permanent truce broke 
down in september the united states cut off military aid to the 
contras early last year 
a us trade embargo imposed in 1985 has cost nicaragua 315 
million in income and another 422 million in credits refused the 
sandinistas because of us loan vetoes at world lending 
institutions ortega claims 
nicaragua runs a big deficit with its major trading partners in 
the soviet bloc imports last year totaled 800 million while 
exports earned only 200 million

prosecutors dropped an illegal arms case against 
a retired israeli army general and 10 other people after the 
defendants argued the united states wouldnt have frowned on 2 
billion in us weapons sales to iran 
an investigation by the us attorneys office found no evidence 
linking the arms transactions charged in the indictment with the 
socalled irancontra affair court papers said 
however the defendants argued they had reason to believe their 
activities had or would receive us government approval a 
contention that gained credence after the irancontra arms scandal 
came to light 
the defendants said they believed their plan to sell fighter 
planes missiles tanks and spare parts to iran was officially 
sanctioned by the us government according to papers filed in us 
district court 
prosecutors could not produce witnesses to contradict the 
defendants claim so the conspiracy case was dropped wednesday 
gen avraham baram who left the israeli army in 1984 and later 
served as an arms consultant for israel and samuel evans an 
american lawyer based in london were among the 11 people and four 
corporations named in the papers they were indicted between may and 
october 1986 
evans also was the lawyer for adnan khashoggi a multibillionaire 
saudi arms dealer who was said to have been involved in some of the 
irancontra weapons deals 
the us customs service had set up an elaborate sting using 
a fraudulent bank account in late 1985 about the time reagan 
administration officials were secretly selling arms to iran and 
using the proceeds to finance the contras fighting to overthrow the 
leftist nicaraguan government 
the defendants charged that cyrus hashemi an iranian oilman 
identified as the us governments chief operative in the sting 
was at the same time involved in shipping covert arms to iran for 
the administration 
prosecutors said that hashemi would have contradicted the 
defendants claim that they had the governments blessing however 
hashemi died in 1986 and the government could not procure the 
attendance at trial of any other such witness court papers said 
in september and october 1986 us attorney rudolph giulianis 
office was told by the department of defense and the central 
intelligence agency that there were no documents to support 
allegations that the united states sanctioned the delivery of arms 
to iran by the defendants 
but it was publicly revealed in november 1986 that members of the 
national security council had secretly engaged in the sale of arms 
to iran

a man who told school children at a 
bus stop he would get them next resembled the kidnapper of 
michaela garecht who was abducted in november from a supermarket 
parking lot according to authorities 
four elementary school children were at the stop on wednesday 
when the man drove by and warned them through a loudspeaker 
sheriffs deputy gordon altman said 
the man did not attempt to grab any of the children 
were taking it seriously because his description is similar to 
the general description of the suspect in the michaela garecht 
kidnapping case altman said the kids are about her age too 
michaela 9 of hayward was abducted nov 19 by a man with long 
blond hair and acne the hayward girl was with a friend when she was 
grabbed the other girl got away 
hundreds of volunteers spent hours stuffing envelopes and placing 
posters around the san francisco bay area to try to find clues even 
san francisco 49ers quarterback joe montana went on tv with his wife 
and pleaded for girls return no demands were made to michaelas 
parents 
altman would not describe the vehicle involved in wednesdays 
incident or be specific about the mans description saying the 
information might damage the investigation 
when youre looking for a needle in the haystack you cant 
overlook anything altman said anything could be the clue that 
leads us to the guy

joel steinbergs lawyer says a judges rulings 
have tied his hands and made an acquittal in the infamous murder 
trial nearly impossible 
the lawyer ira london said wednesday the best he can hope for 
is a conviction of criminally negligent homicide steinberg is 
charged with seconddegree murder in the beating death of his 
illegally adopted daughter lisa 
the defense was scheduled to resume its case today by calling 
teachers from the school where lisa was a firstgrader they were 
expected to testify that the 6yearold child appeared healthy 
happy and well cared for 
london said two rulings by judge harold rothwax were major 
setbacks allowing the jury to see a videotape of steinbergs 
battered livein companion hedda nussbaum and approving a request 
to have steinberg examined by a prosecution psychiatrist 
my view of the case is that the judge has tied both my hands 
behind my back london said he tied one hand when he let in the 
hedda beatings he tied the other when he took away joels fifth 
amendment right to remain silent 
rothwax had no comment on londons remarks 
ms nussbaum 46 testified for seven days as a prosecution 
witness she had been charged with murder in lisas death along with 
steinberg but the charges were dropped 
criminally negligent homicide carries a penalty of up to four 
years in prison london said steinberg wont like his prediction 
he wants an acquittal but i dont think thats realistic 
london said hell probably do jail time 
arnold kleinick president of the new york state trial lawyers 
association called londons comments during a trial unusual i 
never heard a lawyer say such a thing 
stephen villers a law professor at new york university said he 
also had never heard a defense lawyer in a prominent murder case 
make such a concession which he termed inappropriate 
londons cocounsel adrian diluzio pointed out that we 
havent thrown in the towel at all were pursuing this case 
vigorously 
in granting the prosecutions request to have one of its 
psychiatrists examine steinberg rothwax said the defense appeared 
to be presenting an insanity defense even though they were not 
saying so 
by allowing the examination the judge gives the prosecution a 
chance to rebut an insanity defense 
steinberg may refuse to be examined by the prosecution 
psychiatrist but then the judge may tell the jury the defense has 
presented an insanity case and they should consider whether 
steinberg in effect has something to hide 
there is nothing in this case other than hedda that says joel 
committed this crime diluzio said the prosecutions whole case 
lies in the lap of hedda and we think the jury will find that hedda 
is not a credible witness 
diluzio said he believes that at this point the best course of 
action is for him to submit to the exam

a forest planted in the nations heartland 
to honor americans killed in vietnam was saved from a bank 
foreclosure sale by veterans of that war and other supporters around 
the country 
what were trying to do is heal the people said vietnam 
veteran geoffrey steiner 39 who started the project nine years 
ago this is a living memorial 
fruth companies inc a coors beer distributor in brainerd gave 
5400 wednesday on behalf of adolph coors co and coors 
distributors in minnesota toward the 603353 needed to keep the 
100acre forest near cushing a tiny town about 120 miles north of 
minneapolis from being sold 
the remainder of the money to save the veterans national living 
memorial came from vietnam veterans of america chapters and 
individuals around the country 
i think the good lord sent them said steiner who said he is 
more than halfway toward his goal of planting a tree for every one 
of the approximately 58000 americans who died in vietnam 
vva chapters in dayton ohio and junction city kan also have 
raised several hundred dollars to pay property taxes on the tract 
said terry thompson legislative coordinator for the dayton chapter 
there also are plans to place the property in a trust so it 
cannot be encroached upon again said thompson who arrived in 
minnesota earlier this week to help raise money 
the forest stands on a little hilltop about three miles off a 
highway at the dead end of a country road 
at the center of the stand of small trees that has been planted 
over the past eight years is a wooden flagpole flying an american 
flag and a stone marker 
thompson who is not a veteran but volunteers in the dayton 
chapter said she decided to help steiner after reading a newspaper 
article last month on his plight and the unusual memorial 
she called the memorial part of that healing process that will 
be beneficial to vietnam vets and their families 
steiner a marine in vietnam in 196768 who now counsels 
veterans said he paid 23000 in cash for the land in 1980 after 
selling his minneapolis home since then he has planted more than 
30000 trees 
he was about to lose the land for failing to repay an 8000 loan 
from randall state bank that he secured with the property in 1984 to 
buy a car for his wife had the land been sold the only way steiner 
could have gotten it back would have been to match the winning bid 
within a year 
with only half an hour before the aucition was to begin 
wednesday steiner along with thompson the beer distributor and 
two other vva officials from ohio brought the money to a little 
falls law office to pay the debt 
coors based in golden colo has a longstanding interest in 
helping veterans and their families said gary fruth coowner of 
fruth companies 
they kind of entered this as a white knight fruth said we 
just didnt like the idea of them taking it away from that guy after 
all of his work

a parolee whose violent outburst ended in 
the deaths of two hostages and himself was anxious about the 
possible breakup of his marriage and haunted by his vietnam war 
experiences say those who knew him but wayne strozzi 35 also was 
remembered as a good father neighbor and friend in the aftermath of 
tuesday nights bloody drama 
there was something wrong with wayne last night wayne wasnt 
wayne last night said maryanne urista a neighbor who called 
strozzi a good father who cared so much about his girls and a 
horseman who loved his animals and went on family rides 
authorities investigating the standoff at the riverhouse 
restaurant here said they are mainly concerned now with the 
accidental killing of a hostage by police 
we are focusing on one question and that is that matter of the 
justification of the police shooting said larimer county district 
attorney stu vanmeveren 
fenton crookshank 45 of loveland was shot and killed by a 
loveland police officer as he tried to escape through a bathroom 
window of the restaurant police said crookshank failed to heed 
warnings to stop 
strozzi had broken into the restaurant and taken about 20 people 
hostage during the standoff he threatened he was going to waste 
everybody and intended to burn down the restaurant and demanded a 
getaway car and a plane to libya 
at one point waitress ann knight said strozzi ordered her to

was gunned down by a sharpshooter 
after strozzi was shot he apparently shot another hostage 
waitress sally mills 40 in a dying reflex police said strozzi 
and mills died later at mckee medical center 
vanmeveren said he was trying to determine whether the officers 
were covered by colorado law when they opened fire the law mandates 
that when police fire at someone they have reasonable fear that they 
or a hostage will be hurt or that the person has committed a felony 
with a dangerous weapon 
vanmeveren declined to name the officers who shot strozzi and the 
hostage he said they were suffering from posttraumatic stress 
and were placed on leave with pay until the case is resolved 
most people who knew strozzi were shocked by the news of the 
standoff though some said he had serious emotional problems 
strozzis estranged wife bobbi called him a real sweetheart 
i think he had a lot of emotional problems because of 
vietnam she said it was real hard to feel good about himself 
again he was trying real real hard to work his problems out heck 
he hadnt touched a drink in over a year or any other kind of 
drug 
the couple had graduated from a domestic violence class together 
the events tuesday night began when bobbi strozzi told police her 
husband had choked and threatened her 
strozzi a las vegas native served one year in vietnam with the 
101st infantry in the early 1970s and received a general discharge 
he openly discussed his combat experiences which a halfway house 
counselor described as pretty heavy 
his father harry strozzi of las vegas said his son was pretty 
stressed out 
after moving to loveland in 1975 with their two daughters the 
couple was separated late last year last month bobbi and the two 
daughters moved out of the trailer where the family had lived 
strozzi a construction worker was arrested in 1984 and 
convicted 1 years later on charges of possessing and selling 
cocaine he was sentenced to three years in prison strozzi was 
paroled in 1987 after time in a minimumsecurity prison and a 
halfway house 
william fitzgerald a parole officer in boulder county said 
parole officers didnt consider strozzi a threat 
in our records there is absolutely no indication of him being 
violent fitzgerald said

a state judge who wanted a rivals 
courtroom so badly he broke into his office and removed his papers 
and books was awarded the chambers when el paso county commissioners 
decided seniority should prevail 
the commissioners decision wednesday in favor of district judge 
peter peca jr means judge jose troche is a man without a chambers 
el paso has 11 district judges but only 10 courtrooms 
the office and courtroom in dispute had been vacated last week by 
ward koehler the former 168th district judge who defeated peca last 
november for a spot in the states 8th court of appeals 
in one of his last acts as district judge koehler decreed that 
troche his appointed successor should get the sixthfloor office 
rather than peca 
peca who was elected to the 171st district two years ago had 
been the odd judge out in the game of musical benches he had to 
hold court wherever he could find an available courtroom 
on sunday peca broke into the office and removed papers books 
and other items belonging to troche who had moved in friday and 
posted koehlers decree on the door 
when troche went to the office monday to tidy up he found pecas 
nameplate in place of koehlers order the locks had been changed 
and troches property had been moved to a table in a jury room down 
the hall 
despite pecas unilateral action commissioners bought his 
argument that he should get a permanent office because he has 
seniority over troche 
peca was not present at the commissioners meeting but troche 
commented id like the court to establish some procedure for 
allocating court space

ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
has written to the nations leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
offering to negotiate a solution to panamas political crisis 
delvalle asked noriega in a letter to accept this 
invitation to reach an understanding which will benefit our country 
and all panamanians 
a copy of the letter dated dec 27 and written on stationery of 
the panamanian embassy in washington was obtained by the associated 
press from noriega opponents who refused to be identified further 
in february 1988 delvalle attempted to fire noriega as commander 
of panamas defense forces after two federal grand juries in florida 
indicted the general on drug trafficking and money laundering 
charges 
noriega orchestrated delvalles ouster by the national assembly 
and replaced him with education minister manuel solis palma 
the united states which continues to recognize delvalle as 
panamas president imposed economic sanctions on panama and brought 
diplomatic pressure to bear in an unsuccessful effort to force 
noriega to resign 
delvalle signed the letter president of the republic of 
panama the panamanian embassy in washington is in the hands of 
noriega opponents 
a defense forces official in panama city who spoke condition of 
anonymity said we have no knowledge of delvalles letter 
delvalle said the nations political and economic crisis has 
created hardships for panamanians and caused the government to be 
incapable of providing basic public services due to a drop in 
government revenue 
he wrote the letter six days after meeting in washington with 
presidentelect bush who told reporters later his policy will 
continue to be that noriega must go 
raul saint malo a counselor at the panamanian embassy in 
washington said in a telephone interview delvalles letter was sent 
by way of the vatican embassy in washington to the vatican embassy 
in panama city 
diplomatic sources said delvalle had returned to panama and was 
in hiding

britain has no doubts that libya is building a 
factory to produce chemical weapons but it would require some 
convincing that the factory should be destroyed the foreign 
office said today 
we do not believe that it has gone into production yet 
foreign office minister william waldegrave said on british 
broadcasting corp radio it is there it is defended by missiles 
we are sure of that 
the foreign office said wednesday night that the british 
government has independent information confirming that the plant 
near rabta a desert town 60 miles from tripoli is designed to 
produce chemical weapons 
libya says the factory will produce pharmaceuticals 
waldegrave would not elaborate on the nature of information 
britain had obtained but said there is no question the plant is 
designed to produce very large quantities of chemical weapons 
on wednesday night a foreign office spokesman said we have 
been in contact with a number of countries to make the point that we 
have independent information on the libyan chemical warfare 
programs 
this information shows that the plant is very large and that 
there is no doubt it is intended for chemical warfare production 
the spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the announcement came hours after american warplanes shot down 
two libyan jet fighters over the mediterranean us officials said 
the libyan jets displayed clear hostile intent against the 
american warplanes 
the attack occurred after the united states charged that libya 
built the plant near rabta to produce chemical weapons however 
us officials said the downing of the libyan jets was unrelated to 
their concerns about the plant 
waldegrave added today it the plant makes everybody both in 
the region and outside nervous that this regime which is the most 
unstable unpredictable and dangerous in the world has this great 
capacity 
but he said one would need some convincing that the plant 
should be destroyed by military force 
what we want is a proper worldwide international convention 
with proper verification which would be quite difficult and quite 
expensive but not impossible waldegrave said

senate majority leader george mitchell today 
joined other top lawmakers in calling the us downing of two libyan 
jets an appropriate act of selfdefense 
we regret the tragedy involved but i dont think theres 
any basis for secondguessing the decision by these pilots 
mitchell dmaine said on nbctvs today show 
he said he believed the action of the american pilots flying in 
international airspace over the mediterranean sea was an 
appropriate act of selfdefense under the rules of engagement and 
given the circumstances that existed at the time 
mitchell made similar remarks on cbs this morning and abcs 
good morning america 
asked if he would support a us attack on the plant in libya 
which the administration says is intended to produce chemical 
weapons mitchell said on cbs that presidentelect bush ought to 
have the fullest range of options before he makes his decision 
congressional leaders overwhelmingly backed the us downing of 
the jets and most took great pains to deny the action was linked to 
the allegations concerning the libyan plant 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said after senators were briefed wednesday by defense department 
officials that the shooting down of the libyan mig23s was 
appropriate under the circumstances 
it was a justified defensive measure taken by american pilots 
who felt they were in jeopardy and were taking sort of evasive 
action said nunn 
defense secretary frank carlucci said wednesday at a pentagon 
news conference that the commander of the f14 patrol made the 
decision to fire at the libyan aircraft in selfdefense and 
apparently shot down both planes 
nunn said adm william j crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff assured him there was no connection between the confrontation 
and us reaction to the suspected libyan chemical weapons factory 
libya has claimed the plant makes only pharmaceuticals and has 
offered to allow a onetime inspection of the facility by 
international experts the united states rejected the offer 
the action took place 45 to 50 miles away from shore it wasnt 
even in the approximate region of that chemical plant nunn said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the american pilots had 
reason to believe they were under attack and they were acting in 
selfdefense 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the incident the 
first battle between the united states and libya since american jets 
bombed tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 appears to be 
selfdefense pure and simple 
gadhafi never learns dole said maybe this time he will 
finally get it straight whenever he threatens american forces we 
will defend ourselves 
sen john glenn dohio a member of nunns panel declined 
comment on the us action the briefing that we got did not cover 
some of the things i want to know before i say it was right or 
wrong said glenn 
glenn said he is still waiting for final information 
following a debriefing of the f14 pilots who were flown to naples 
italy glenn said he wants to know about any missiles that might 
have been fired angles of attack use of radar and justification 
for firing 
he also said he wanted more information about the suspected 
chemical weapons plant 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
suggested libyan leader col moammar gadhafi might have provoked the 
us action because he is able to take center stage and win public 
support only when he is perceived as the victim of superpower 
oppression

the united states and laos have agreed 
to conduct yearround joint activities to resolve the fate of 
missing american servicemen according to a us statement 
in the talks the laotians also agreed in principle to cooperate 
in antinarcotics programs said the statement dated wednesday 
the talks were held monday and tuesday in the capital of laos 
vientiane by teams led by laotian vice foreign minister soubanh 
srithirath and richard childress director of asian affairs at the 
us national security council 
the us team issued its statement through the us embassy in 
bangkok 
the statement said the two sides reviewed the issue of missing 
americans and agreed to establish a yearround schedule of joint 
activities including research further surveys and excavations 
it said specifics of the plan will be discussed during a meeting of 
technical experts later this month 
the united states wants to account for 547 americans listed as 
missing in action in laos as a result of the indochina war which 
ended in 1975 the two sides have conducted four joint excavations 
of us warplane crash sites to search for remains 
the united states also acknowledged laos domestic problems 
recently complicated by a poor rice harvest because of drought and 
renewed its pledge to respond to the extent possible the 
statement said 
it said following a us expression of concern over narcotics 
production and trafficking the laos government informed the us 
side of its agreement in principle to bilateral cooperation with the 
united states on narcotics program activities a development we 
strongly welcome 
us officials have accused laotian government and military 
authorities of involvement in the production and trafficking of 
large quantities of opium and marijuana the laotians deny this and 
have protested the charge 
the two sides also expressed interest in increased commercial 
contacts the statement said it said representatives of the us 
state and commerce departments also met with laotian officials to 
discuss trade and investment

whatever touched off the latest violent 
confrontation between the united states and libya the most 
immediate danger is that the incident could undermine us efforts 
to mobilize its allies to block the spread of chemical weapons 
even before wednesdays military clash europeans were reluctant 
to join american concern over a libyan facility us officials said 
was designed to produce chemical weapons 
libyas col moammar gadhafi is the leader americans love to 
hate unfortunately gadhafis ability to provoke strong us 
responses had made it tougher for the reagan administration to 
convince its allies to agree to joint action against libya 
in part the reason is economic libya sells oil to some european 
countries and it is a market for european exports but the 
reluctance also seems based in the belief that the us tends to 
overreact to gadhafi 
libya and its allies portray the clash as david versus goliath 
over the mediterranean a superpower engaged in military action 
against a nation of fewer than 4 million people 
as they gave details of the air battle 40 miles off the libyan 
coast us officials appeared clearly worried about the potential 
aftershocks 
immediately after us jets downed two libyan mig23s described 
as on a hostile course a white house spokesman said president 
reagan considers the incident closed 
we now consider this matter closed echoed defense secretary 
frank carlucci at a pentagon briefing 
when asked of the possible impact on the meeting this weekend in 
paris to discuss how to halt the proliferation of chemical weaponry 
particularly among third world countries william burns the us 
arms control director said i dont see it as really germane to 
the conference i think that other nations will not see it as 
germane as well 
the insistence of us officials that the military clash was an 
isolated incident that should have no effect on the conference 
seemed the clearest indication they were worried that it would have 
a serious impact 
french foreign minister roland dumas said his country the host 
for the weekend conference hopes that tension in the 
mediterranean does not increase as a result of wednesdays 
incident 
it is still too early to know the exact circumstances of the 
incident dumas said france is following with close attention 
the consequences that could result from this action 
west german officials have rejected us allegations that a 
german firm assisted libya in construction of the chemical plant 
european nations have never readily accepted in full us 
concerns about gadhafis actions 
according to us accounts the libyan jets approached the us 
planes in a manner that under international rules of engagement was 
clearly threatening 
you cannot in this day and time and modern technology wait 
until another plane has fired in order to defend yourself said 
sen sam nunn of georgia chairman of the senate armed services 
committee its too late then 
but military rules of engagement arent likely to be uppermost in 
the minds of the 100 or so foreign ministers who will meet in paris 
the united states delegation headed by secretary of state george 
p shultz hopes to convince other industrialized nations to deny 
chemical weapons technology to third world countries and unite on 
sanctions against countries that use poison gas 
the americans also want to strengthen the authority of the un 
secretary general to investigate allegations of the use of chemical 
weapons 
if the fears expressed by dumas and indirectly by us officials 
prove correct it would provide one more case of how fragile the 
plans of superpowers can become in that violenceprone region

the supreme court today dismissed two 
appeals that a defense lawyer called the last legal battle to 
save two sikhs condemned to hang for the 1984 assassination of prime 
minister indira gandhi 
a panel of five justices quickly turned down a plea by satwant 
singh the lone surviving assassin another fivejudge panel acting 
almost as swiftly rejected a petition by kehar singh who allegedly 
helped plot the murder 
this is the last legal battle we cant go anywhere now said 
kehar singhs attorney ram jethmalani 
kehar singh 54 and satwant singh 30 are to hang at 8 am 
friday in the refurbished gallows of new delhis maximumsecurity 
tihar central jail 
the two men are not related but like all members of the sikh 
faith use the name singh which means lion 
heavilyarmed security forces were placed on maximum alert and 
checkpoints set up in the capital and in the northern states of 
haryana himachal pradesh and punjab where militant sikhs have been 
waging a 6yearold war for independence authorities fear the 
executions could trigger a new outbreak of communal violence 
jethmalani one of the countrys leading criminal attorneys 
asked the supreme court to block the scheduled executions 
challenging president ramaswamy venkataramans refusal of clemency 
for kehar singh 
the attorney said the president considered only the governments 
case and ignored new evidence including the arrest of a sikh 
terrorist who allegedly confessed he was the mastermind of mrs 
gandhis murder 
i am arguing in the shadow of the death of kehar singh with 
two ready hangmen and a prepared pyre an emotional jethmalani 
told the justices 
venkataraman twice rejected the mercy plea saying he was bound 
by the recommendations of the government headed by the slain prime 
ministers son and successor rajiv gandhi 
the governments chief attorney g ramaswamy said kehar singhs 
guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the trial court and 
an appeals court as well as the supreme court 
down the corridor another court panel rejected an appeal by 
satwant singh seeking prosecution of two of mrs gandhis security 
guards the inmate claimed the two guards shot him after he had been 
disarmed and that their actions were tantamount to attempted murder 
the justices ruled the appeal had no merit 
satwant singh did not file a mercy petition with the president 
but under indian laws his death sentence was automatically delayed 
when kehar singh sought clemency 
in london the amnesty international human rights group and a 
leading british jurist lord gifford appealed today for clemency 
for the two sikhs and said the evidence against kehar singh was too 
weak to justify his conviction 
two sikh bodyguards satwant singh and beant singh shot mrs 
gandhi in the garden of her new delhi residence on oct 31 1984 
mrs gandhi apparently was killed in retaliation for an army raid 
she ordered four months earlier to rout sikh militants from the 
golden temple the sikhs holiest shrine more than 1200 people 
died most of them sikhs 
beant singh was killed in a shootout with other security guards 
and is revered as a martyr by many militant sikhs satwant singh was 
injured 
kehar singh beants uncle was arrested a month later and 
charged with helping to plot mrs gandhis assassination which 
triggered antisikh riots across northern india by members of the 
majority hindu religion more than 2700 people were killed nearly 
all of them sikhs 
sikh violence since then has escalated at least 2440 people 
died last year in northern punjab state alone 
the eightmonth trial which culminiated in convictions and death 
sentences on jan 22 1986 was held in a makeshift courtroom at 
the prison 
a third sikh balbir singh also was arrested tried and 
convicted on conspiracy charges and sentenced to death in mrs 
gandhis assassination the supreme court however overturned his 
conviction and sentence in august for lack of evidence 
capital punishment is rare in india of 85000 murder cases 
between 1974 and 1984 only 288 death sentences were passed 
government statistics say 
the last hanging in new delhis tihar prison was in february 1984

took part in the beating the man was accused of running a red light 
and trying to elude police 
shannon accused the officers of using excessive force conspiring 
to keep the incident quiet and depriving the man of his civil rights 
this case is particularly disturbing because of the number of 
officers involved and the failure even to conduct an 
investigation the attorney general said 
the suit asks the court to bar the 13 officers from further 
violations and prohibit them from handling arrests until they take a 
courtapproved course in the use of force 
the officers have 30 days to respond to the complaint they will 
remain on active duty pending any court action police said 
boston police commissioner francis m roache is frustrated that 
the victim has refused to cooperate with the department which 
contacted him after he wrote to the attorney general said police 
spokesman james jordan 
the suit said that john l smith jr 25 allegedly ran a red 
light early on may 12 and sped off when a cruiser tried to pull him 
over more than a dozen cruisers gave chase for about 15 minutes 
until smiths car hit a curb 
according to the complaint smith turned off the engine and sat 
in the car but officers smashed the windows and hauled him out one 
officer then began beating smith on the back of his head and knees 
with his baton the complant said 
more officers arrived and smith was handcuffed several officers 
surrounded him delivering kicks and other blows the complaint 
charged eventually 13 officers were present some of whom stood 
about chatting during the beating the suit said 
officers took smith to a police station for booking he was told 
to wash his face for photographing the complaint said

mayor marion s barry jr said today he is not 
afraid of anything that might come out of the current investigation 
into whether he interfered with a police drug probe 
barrys telephone records along with other city records have 
been subpoenaed by the us attorneys office in its investigation 
im not afraid of anything that might come out of this barry 
said in an interview on wol radio 
referring to investigations of several years ago by former us 
attorney joseph digenova barry said digenova spent 30 million 
investigating my administration and very little came out of that 
barry who denies having tried to disrupt the drug investigation 
will be questioned about the matter possibly this week according 
to sources who spoke on condition they not be identified 
in a statement issued wednesday barry said we welcome this 
investigation the district government will cooperate fully and 
will comply with any subpoenas the grand jury may issue 
the washington post reported in todays editions that a federal 
grand jury has also subpoenaed thousands of documents relating to a 
joint dcvirgin islands personnel project the former manager of 
the project charles lewis is a key figure in the current barry 
case 
barry who has faced repeated allegations of personal impropriety 
in his 10 years as mayor of the nations capital is facing his most 
serious political crisis yet following disclosures that he met last 
month with a man who was the subject of a city police drug 
investigation 
sources familiar with the investigation said the records sought 
by the us attorneys office cover calls placed from the telephone 
in barrys automobile as well as calls placed in other ways that 
would generate a record those would include calls made through 
police and city switchboards 
barry has acknowledged calling the assistant police chief isaac 
fulwood who is supervising the investigation but has said he was 
trying to speed up the probe and not influence its outcome 
the records search involves any calls that may have been made 
around the time last month when barry has acknowledged visiting a 
washington hotel room occupied by lewis 
district of columbia police called off an attempt to make an 
undercover purchase of drugs from lewis after two detectives 
encountered one of the mayors security guards while barry was at 
the hotel authorities have said 
police said a later search of the room after lewis checked out 
found traces of cocaine but there was no indication how long they 
had been there 
barry has denied any drug use but admitted poor judgment 
also sought in the federal investigation are records of calls by 
chief of police maurice turner and other city officials including 
tape recordings of calls through the police dispatchers phone 
system 
us attorney jay b stephens said last week that his office was 
conducting a full investigation of the allegations against barry 
including whether he used drugs or tried to hinder a police 
investigation 
meanwhile the inspector general of the us interior department 
is conducting a separate investigation into an agreement in which 
barry and other dc officials were to provide consulting services 
to the virgin islands on personnel issues lewis was in charge of 
that agreement for the virgin islands government 
stephens asked about the search for telephone records said he 
could not comment on matters under investigation 
police department spokesman shannon cockett spokeswoman for 
turner said we will not comment while the us attorneys office 
is investigating this matter 
barry elected three times by large majorities came up through 
the ranks of local civil rights leaders in the 1960s to become the 
mayor of the heavily black city in 1978 
barry who is married acknowledged last year he once had a 
personal relationship with a convicted cocaine dealer karen 
johnson he denied using drugs or purchasing them from her however 
and denied allegations she had been paid hush money to prevent her 
from talking to federal investigators 
at the same time barry has sought to be a visible leader in the 
citys battle against drugs appearing at antidrug rallies with 
jesse jackson and police officials the city recorded a record 371 
homicides last year more than half of which police said were drug 
related 
lewis has remained unavailable for comment since the dec 22 
hotel incident but sources say he has been in contact with federal 
investigators 
he is a former city government official and a native of the 
virgin islands who was fired in april from his job as assistant to 
the governor of the virgin islands

west german financial examiners found 
no proof to support us allegations that a west german firm helped 
build a plant in libya designed to produce chemical weapons 
officials said today 
the announcement ended a probe of the imhausenchemie company in 
southwest badenwuerttemberg state the federal finance ministry 
ordered the companys records examined in response to the us 
claims 
there is no evidence of illegal exports freiburg district 
director willi voegele told reporters after delivering results of 
the inquiry to the company offices in lahr 130 miles south of 
frankfurt 
voegele said the inquiry had not found any evidence to show that 
the company or its branches sold pieces of chemical plant 
equipment to libya from 1984 until today 
they also have not helped with plans or with specialized 
knowledge he said 
juergen hippenstielimhausen managing director of the company 
repeated his denials of the us allegations saying the firm had 
nothing absolutely nothing to do with this libyan tale 
also today the west german government said that five other west 
german companies in all probability provided iraq with materials 
that can be used to make chemical weapons 
no charges have been filed in that case which came to official 
attention before the allegations against imhausenchemie surfaced 
the government said the companies under investigation are walter 
engineer trading of hamburg the karl kolb company of dreieich 
pilot plant of dreieich preussag of hanover and heberberger bau of 
schifferstadt 
the british government meanwhile joined the united states in 
claiming to have proof that the libyan plant was designed to produce 
chemical weapons 
the statement wednesday night from the foreign office was the 
first comment by british officials on us allegations and other 
reports that libya built the plant to make chemical weapons 
including poison gas 
this information shows that the plant is very large and that 
there is no doubt it is intended for chemical warfare production 
a foreign office spokesman said 
so far companies from west germany east germany japan italy 
south korea austria and switzerland have been named in news reports 
as being involved with the plant 
todays financial times said washingtons concerns about the 
plant center on the involvement by at least a dozen western 
european and japanese companies 
the british newspaper also quoted unidentified us officials as 
saying the plant is surrounded by sovietmade sa6 antiaircraft 
missiles 
it is not customary to defend a pharmaceutical plant with 
surfacetoair missiles the financial times quoted one us 
official as saying

western travelers already a privileged class in 
the soviet union will gain further favors feb 1 because their hard 
currency can exempt them from the fallout of a customs war among 
socialist countries 
the soviet union is slapping a 100ruble or 165 limit on the 
value of consumer goods that travelers may carry out of the country 
and a complete ban on exports of caviar and childrens shoes from 
feb 1 until the end of 1990 in attempt to shore up extreme short 
supplies at home 
but the deputy customs chief vitaly boyarov told a news 
briefing today that purchases made with hard currency will be 
exempted 
that will allow the soviet union to continue earning scarce hard 
currency by selling the best caviar fur hats and coats vodka and 
souvenirs to foreigners in stores that require dollars pounds or 
other freely convertible currency 
the restrictions on export of consumer goods particularly home 
appliances are directed primarily at citizens of other socialist 
countries 
since november czechoslovakia east germany and poland have 
enacted similar laws to stop hordes of shoppers from neighboring 
nations from stripping their shelves of items impossible to find at 
home 
none of the socialist countries of eastern europe has fully 
convertible currencies and they trade with each other based on 
exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting countrys cost 
of production much less bring a profit 
still boyarov denied descriptions in both the soviet and western 
press that the reciprocal restrictions amount to a trade war this 
is not so he said because the restrictions do not cover 
foreign trade 
he indicated the restrictions are aimed at halting the sale in 
rubles of soviet goods that purchasers can then sell for hard 
currency 
we are encouraging exports but not exports at any price and 
not those damaging soviet citizens he said 
our stores are empty and we have to take steps he said 
customs analysis has shown that in the past 10 months travelers 
have left the soviet union hauling 200000 washing machines and half 
a million television sets boyarov said 
this despite the fact that soviet televisions earned a reputation 
a few years ago for blowing up and setting apartments on fire 
the soviet union manufactures just 7 million televisions a year 
for its 284 million people 
boyarov also said foreign embassy workers have been abusing their 
diplomatic privileges with one such person taking 1400 irons 
several hundred freezers 35 million bars of soap and an impressive 
amount of detergent out of the country in nine months 
television sets have joined windshield wipers in the last few 
months on the long list of deficit goods in the soviet union 
but consumers have been particularly irate over the complete absence 
of soap and detergent one furious consumer signed a letter to a 
newspaper the mother of two dirty children

eighteen police officers have been accused of 
misconduct for their part in an antigang raid in police allegedly 
ransacked four apartments roughed up residents and painted 
antigang slogans it was reported today 
investigators are also looking into allegations that the officers 
were acting under what they assumed were orders from station capt 
thomas d elfmont to render the residences uninhabitable the 
los angeles times reported 
a quartergram of crack was seized in the aug 1 raid which also 
resulted in one drug charge and 33 people being taken into custody 
elfmont and cmdr william booth a police spokesman declined to 
comment on the case booth said the case had not been formally 
reviewed by the department administration 
the newspaper citing unidentified sources said seven officers 
were ordered to appear before department tribunals they could be 
fired or suspended without pay 
the 11 other officers are subject to lesser suspensions of up to 
10 days or letters of reprimand the newspaper reported 
all are accused of violating departmental regulations ranging 
from lying to investigators to excessive property damage the times 
said 
the district attorneys office is also investigating to determine 
whether any officers should be prosecuted the times reported 
the raid was carried out by more than 70 officers at four 
tenement apartments which had been targeted by the police antigang 
task force following a series of gangrelated driveby shootings 
officers obtained a warrant to search for drugs but during the 
raid they ripped plaster off walls slashed furniture with knives 
destroyed toilets and sinks with sledgehammers and hacked apart 
stereos according to a lawsuit filed in federal court by about 40 
people claiming their civil rights were violated 
the lawsuit alleged that some of the officers spraypainted 
antigang slogans and lapd rules on walls and that some 
residents taken to the station after the raid were ordered to 
whistle the theme from the andy griffith show and run a gauntlet 
of officers beating them with fists 
those who didnt whistle were beaten with fists and steel 
flashlights the lawsuit charged 
damage to the apartments was so severe that the red cross offered 
emergency housing to several residents 
the police internal affairs division in a 668page report said 
much of the damage attributed to the officers existed before the 
raid or occurred afterward but it determined that officers had 
caused excessive damage

afghan military cadets went on a new years day 
rampage in tashkent burning cars and smashing furniture in a 
drunken and drugfueled brawl that left an infant and two other 
people dead a newspaper said today 
komsomolskaya pravda said 30 drunken afghan cadets went to a 
market in tashkent to sell sunglasses lighters and other items that 
are hard to find in the soviet union 
soviets objected to afghans becoming black marketeers and 
fighting broke out when the afghans began insulting the soviets the 
paper said 
police rapidly intervened and sent the afghans back to 
dormitories around tashkent where they live it said 
the afghans gave their version of events to other afghans living 
in the dormitories and they began smashing furniture and windows 
according to the newspaper account another group of afghans many 
of whom had been taking drugs smashed a traffic police post the 
paper said 
the afghans jumped on the hoods of passing cars and lay down on 
the street komsomolskaya pravda said twenty cars were vandalized 
and four burned according to preliminary information the paper 
said 
komsomolskaya pravda quoting a report printed in uzbekistan 
newspapers said a 6monthold child was killed as a result of the 
rampages it did not give details two people hurt in the rioting 
died later of heavy trauma in the hospital komsomolskaya pravda 
said 
sixteen people including seven afghans were reported 
hospitalized including one in critical condition

of tashkent a city of 18 million that is the capital of the uzbek 
republic 
tashkent residents last year told visiting western journalists 
that some goods such as tea kettles had been taken off the market 
because afghans were buying them up and selling them for big profits 
in their homeland 
the paper expressed the hope that sovietafghan relationship 
would not be damaged by the incident the uzbek press report quoted 
by komsomolskaya pravda said violators of soviet laws and ethical

real estate firm is close to buying the sears tower the worlds 
tallest building 
we are compiling a financial analysis which is the first step 
in the offering process we are not involved in any negotiations at 
this time sears said in a statement wednesday 
but jack barthell managing partner of kenneth leventhal amp co of 
los angeles said his client a japanese real estate firm he would 
not identify was nearing a deal to buy the 110story skyscraper for 
about 12 billion

12 billion to 2 billion

the fiveminute dogfight between us and 
libyan fighters over the mediterranean sea climaxed a public drama 
that began last october with charges by the cia that libya was 
building a chemical weapons plant 
tension over the facility marks the latest chapter in a long 
confrontation between america and libya a conflict us officials 
are trying to channel into a diplomatic campaign to close the plant 
which libya denies makes chemical arms 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said wednesday the us f14 
tomcat fighters shot at the sovietmade libyan mig23s in self 
defense and denied that the warplanes or their host aircraft 
carrier the uss john f kennedy intended to attack the suspected 
chemical plant 
nevertheless statements by us officials and the history of 
uslibyan conflict triggered concern in libya pentagon sources 
said libyan airplanes have been extremely active in recent days 
flying close to american reconnaissance and patrol planes 
in the three months since cia deputy director robert gates warned 
of the libyan plant other us officials have made progressively 
more ominous noises president reagan said in an interview broadcast 
last month that he could not rule out a military strike 
that is a decision that has not been made yet reagan said on 
dec 22 the next day presidentelect bush said he shared reagans 
determination to prevent the reported libyan plant from being used 
to spread further destruction 
after the incident reagan privately decided against a military 
strike on the plant according to unnamed administration officials 
quoted in todays editions of the washington post 
reagan thought an attack could cause an international uproar 
and damage us diplomatic efforts including the campaign to curb 
the proliferation of chemical weapons according to the newspapers 
sources 
but on the day before the dogfight over the mediterranean us 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said they believed the 
factory had already started production 
statements like those and the announcement that the carrier uss 
teddy roosevelt was leaving norfolk va on dec 30 on a routine 
mission to the mediterranean fueled speculation of a possible 
strike against the plant similar to the april 1986 bombing raid 
against alleged terrorist training centers in libya 
against that tense backdrop the aircraft carrier kennedy was 
steaming east off the southern coast of crete 127 miles north of 
tobruk libya at noon local time wednesday about 5 am est with 
two f14s flying a routine combat patrol the planes were 
supplemented by an e2c hawkeye electronic warfare aircraft 
according to pentagon officials 
carlucci said us forces had conducted 12 similar maneuvers in 
that area this year without incident 
the mig aircraft were detected shortly after they left al 
bumbah an airfield in northeast libya at 450 est and were tracked 
as they closed on the two f14 aircraft said carlucci 
the us pilots he added maneuvered to avoid the closing 
aircraft they changed speed altitude and direction 
the libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner at 
about 14 miles the us section leader decided his aircraft was in 
jeopardy and they could wait no longer one mig23 was shot down 
with a sparrow missile the second mig was shot down by a sidewinder 
missile at six miles he said 
each time the libyan aircraft sought to put their nose on our 
aircraft they also accelerated so the hostile intent seems to be 
fairly clear he said 
carlucci said there was some preliminary information that 
radars were turned on indicating the libyans were preparing to 
fire there was no evidence that the mig23s fired their aa2 atoll 
airtoair missiles pentagon sources said 
navy pilots spotted two parachutes in an area well into 
international waters 70 miles north of the libya coast and libyan 
ships and helicopters were seen conducting search and rescue 
operations officials said although they did not know whether the 
pilots survived 
the 6th fleet operation had no connection whatsoever with 
libyas newly constructed chemical facility these operations were 
conducted over 600 miles northeast of the facility carlucci said 
at a pentagon news briefing 
we now consider this matter closed he said

key said he and a third road guide protested the split posting 
but lawson told them dont worry about that i know what im 
doing 
key said he had been at the mojave desert checkpoint for about 
five hours when the last truck in the convoy he had been guiding 
picked him up around midnight 
he said he told the driver that rother was still out in the 
desert but the driver told him to get on or get left 
rother who had little water and no map or compass was not 
reported missing for two days he died while trying to walk out of 
the desert where daytime temperatures reached more than 120 degrees

cargo areas of three international airlines twa pan am and air 
france police said 
the packages also contained a typed message that read in part 
congratulations you have found our phony bomb made with molding 
clay one alarm clock and wires said armando arrastia spokesman 
for the port authority which operates the airport 
the message was written on the letterhead of the french tv 
station tf1 and signed by the stations new york bureau chief alain 
chaillou arrastia said 
chaillou and producer bruce frankel were arrested wednesday night 
and charged with violating federal explosives law after twa counter 
employees detected what appeared to be a bomb said fbi agent mary 
frances lilly 
the two men were testing the airlines security said lt frank 
tabert of port authority police 
they were being held at the metropolitan correctional center and 
were to appear today before a us magistrate 
in amsterdam the tv station veronica reported wednesday that it 
had smuggled a fake bomb onto a londonbound klm flight to 
demonstrate that terrorists can pass security checks with relative 
ease 
reporter gert berg was filmed by his station carrying a briefcase 
containing the imitation bomb through security checkpoints and onto 
the aircraft at schiphol airport considered one of western europes 
safest 
klm spokesman nico harmsen today accused the station of 
immature marginal journalism 
theyve shown themselves to be really stupid bombers dont 
have to be real terrorists but this will always give some crazy 
people new ideas he said he refused to say whether security was 
tightened after the incident 
this kind of reporting is not in the interest of aviation and 
will harm its security said dutch national police spokesman rick 
hirs 
the incidents a week after investigators reported that a bomb 
blew up a pan am jet in scotland killing 270 people drew mixed 
reactions from journalism scholars over the ethics of such 
newsgathering techniques 
joan konner dean of columbia universitys graduate school of 
journalism in new york said it was a particularly worthy 
investigation to try to find out how well airport security works 
but added if that is how they want to test the system they have 
to understand the legal risk they are taking 
melvin mencher a columbia professor who has written about 
journalism ethics called the episode nickelanddime reporting 
for some guy to say he got a wad of paper through as a bomb 
sounds a little childish he said i dont know if the risk 
these guys took proved a thing theyve caused inconvenience 
bruce haxthausen an air france spokesman said that because of 
the incident the airline will now inspect every cargo shipment 
received rather than conduct random inspections 
twa spokesman robert blattner said we are very pleased our 
employees were able to use their techniques and just solve the case 
on the spot 
at the pan am small cargo checkin the package had been accepted 
and was on its way to the xray when the new york port authority 
police walked in and seized the package said alan loflin an 
airline spokesman 
alouane jeanterne a tf1 documentary producer in new york said 
he knew nothing about his colleagues alleged actions before their 
arrest 
if youre asking me my ethical judgment about it i really 
dont know he said every reporter has his own way of getting 
things of getting sources of getting to the news i have not come 
to a private opinion yet 
he said he did not know if chaillous superiors in paris knew 
anything in advance about the bogus explosives 
in the message contained in each of the three packages chaillou 
said we are tf1 the largest television network in france and it 
is with due respect and great pleasure that we will tell our 18 
million viewers who watch our daily newscast at 8 that we found 
your company to be keen and consistent with security matters 
frankel 37 was arrested after twa counter employees became 
suspicious of a 6by8inch brown package frankel wanted to check 
through to paris said arrastia 
inspecting the package an employee found what appeared to be a 
bomb he said when the police arrived frankel cried no no its 
a fake and took the bomb apart as the police officer and others 
watched arrastia said 
frankel then told police he had delivered two similar packages to 
the small cargo areas of pan am and air france arrastia said those 
packages were seized after frankels arrest chaillou surrendered 
at kennedy authorities said 
on friday a reporter and cameraman from new yorks wabctv were 
arrested and charged with trespassing for being in a restricted ramp 
area at kennedy airport we had given them permission but they 
went beyond that port authority spokesman mark marchese said 
security is kind of sensitive today

a soviet newspaper has publicly agreed with western 
historians longstanding assertion that former soviet leader josef 
stalin ordered the assassination of fellow revolutionary and rival 
leon trotsky 
literaturnaya gazeta on wednesday published a fullpage article 
on trotsky a leader of the russian revolution in 1917 who came to 
oppose stalin and vladimir lenin 
historian n vasertzky got to the point five paragraphs from the 
end 
stalin couldnt forget past offenses and outrages being 
convinced that trotsky was no longer needed he apparently either 
took the decision himself or let the decision be known to the people 
around him with trotsky its time to finish him the paper 
said 
many soviets are aware of the western belief that stalin ordered 
his rivals assassination and a soviet play and the official 
newspaper pravda have hinted at the same conclusion 
an article last summer in pravda titled demon of the 
revolution came closest saying stalins aide lavrenty beria 
carried out stalins wish to kill trotsky and that he was promoted 
to deputy prime minister for security shortly thereafter in 1941 
the literaturnaya gazeta article quoted the original pravda 
account of trotskys death from 1940 which called him an 
imperialist spy who was killed by his own allies the original 
account also named the assassin as jack morten vandendreich when it 
was actually ramon del rio merkader literaturnaya gazeta charged 
but the newspaper did not say that merkader a spaniard spent 
his old age in moscow drawing a soviet pension he died in havana 
of cancer in 1978 
trotsky started his opposition to lenin in the early 1900s 
saying lenins ideas would result in a oneparty dictatorship but 
following the february revolution in 1917 he joined up with lenin 
to take power from the provisional government in the october 
revolution he served as a member of the ruling politburo from 1919 
to 1927 but lost a power struggle with stalin and was exiled 
stalin reviled trotsky as a traitor and used his alleged 
antisoviet plot as an excuse for bloody purges

toolbox when along comes a southbound truck he said it loses 
two tires off the rear axle one of which hits stratford as he turns 
around from the trunk and killed him instantly

in these circumstances it is almost unbearable and 
unbelievable he said

bombing 
justice yes retaliation no whyte said we may be tempted 
indeed urged by some to flex our muscles in response to show that 
we are men 
to show that we are what to show that we are prepared to let 
more young and more innocent die to let more rescue workers labor 
in more wreckage to find the grisly proof not of our virility but 
of our inhumanity that is what retaliation means 
i for one will have none of it and i hope you will not 
either whyte said 
searchers have recovered 242 of the dead as of wednesday 149

two asian women and their two children 
apparently drowned in the fastmoving niagara river while trying to 
enter the united states illegally in a rubber raft federal 
authorities said today 
the four may have been provided with the boat by smugglers said 
benedict ferro district director of the immigration and 
naturalization service in buffalo 
these people didnt have a chance in the world said ronald 
mcnamee of the new york state parks police 
the body of one of the women an asian in her 30s was recovered 
tuesday afternoon in youngstown about 10 miles north of niagara 
falls 
the victim was believed to have been accompanied by another woman 
and two children ages 13 and 7 who were missing and presumed 
drowned officials said authorities searched the river and lake 
ontario for the three today 
mcnamee said officials learned of the accident after a tipster 
called and said four people he was supposed to meet in the united 
states didnt show up 
its hazardous enough to try to cross the river then in 
summer ferro said the water out there is cold and the strong 
currents are unpredictable 
the temperature early tuesday when the four are believed to have 
started their trek was near zero 
ferro said all four were believed to be from malaysia 
we think this may be part of a major alien smuggling ring he 
said ferro said 11 people were caught trying to use rubber rafts to 
cross the niagara from ontario to new york state last summer 
the ring is believed to smuggle illegal aliens from hong kong to 
vancouver and then through toronto and st catharines into the 
united states for 2000 each mcnamee said 
a purse two suitcases and the raft were found by the coast guard 
on tuesday mcnamee said the purse contained a malaysian passport

jewish emigration from the soviet union soared to 
an eightyear high in 1988 but the number of those opting to go to 
israel continued to decline an agency which helps resettle them 
said today 
regina boucault spokeswoman for the genevabased 
intergovernmental committee for migration said 3510 december 
arrivals at the vienna transit center raised the 1988 total of 
jewish emigrants to 20082 
only 114 or 32 percent of the december arrivals said they 
wanted to continue on to israel ms boucault said for all of 1988 
the share was 71 percent she said 
between 1971 and 1978 more than threefourths of all emigrants 
settled in israel in the past three years the share had been at 
about onefourth before taking a new plunge in 1988 when israel had 
to cope with growing economic problems and a palestinian uprising in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in 1987 244 percent of the total of 8011 chose to go to the 
jewish state emigration was at an alltime low in 1984 with only 
904 jews allowed to leave the soviet union in 1980 21470 
emigrated in both years the share of those going on to israel was 
onethird 
the 1988 arrivals raised to 281934 the number of jewish 
emigrants since the resettlement program began in 1971 the largest 
official exodus 51328 was recorded in 1979 before the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan chilled eastwest relations 
most of the emigrants who do not opt for israel go to the united 
states via another transit camp in rome where they receive language 
training and undergo other procedures prior to resettlement ms 
boucault said a small minority choose australia canada and west 
european countries as their future homes

a cavein nearly a half mile inside a 
coal mine killed three miners in the nations worst such accident in 
2 years authorities said a fourth miner escaped unharmed 
the cavein occurred as the men were removing coal about 2400 
feet into the mine near this southwest kentucky city wednesday 
afternoon said willard stanley commissioner of the state 
department of mines and minerals 
rescue teams began digging toward the men within 20 minutes of 
the collapse said ronnie mcdowell an instructor with the 
department in harlan 
by midday today the last of the bodies had been pulled from the 
cumberland valley contractors no 2 mine killed were steve 
bradburn 36 of harrogate tenn joe ditty 32 of harlan and 
tony osborne 31 of tazwell tenn 
ditty was the brother of mine coowner stanley ditty stanley 
said 
a fourth miner roger wilder 36 of cubbage escaped unharmed 
after the collapse stanley said 
the last time there was an accident in which more than one coal 
miner was killed occurred july 9 1986 near waltonville ill 
said kathy snyder a spokeswoman for us mine safety and health 
administration in arlington va 
that was also a rooffall accident in which three people were 
killed 
stanley said his department would begin an investigation friday 
on why the roof collapsed the mine safety and health administration 
also will send investigators agency spokesman sam stafford said in 
washington 
a dozen people work per shift mining a 48inch seam at the mine 
the agency said 
the mine had no fatalities or serious injuries in 1988 and no 
violations involving roof regulations officials said 
kentucky reported only one rooffall death last year down from 
15 in 1987 the number nationally declined to eight down from 19 
the year before 
officials attributed the improved safety record to greater 
awareness by miners of the dangers of roof falls and to the 
increased use of automated roofsupport systems

a saudi arabian tanker caught in a storm 
in the southern persian gulf was ablaze in the strait of hormuz 
today with eight of its crewmen missing shipping executives 
reported 
the executives identified the vessel as the 36904ton saghera 
manned by a 34member crew of greek officers and sri lankan seamen 
the omani navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats but eight 
remained unaccounted for the executives said they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit which 
monitors maritime traffic around the world said the vessel caught 
fire just outside omani territorial waters before the bend of the 
hormuz gateway to the gulf 
lloyds said the vessel was reported to be abandoned and no 
further details were available 
the shipping executives said winds gusting to 35 mph caused waves 
as high as 30 feet in the southern gulf and the strait of hormuz 
it was not immediately known what started the fire aboard the 
sagheera or where the ship was headed 
lloyds said a twomile oil slick had formed indicating the 
vessel may have been carrying a cargo of fuel 
the shipping executives ruled out the possibility of an attack by 
an iranian speedboat saying the weather was too bad for speedboats 
to operate in the gulf 
they said high seas had prevented patrol boats and salvage 
vessels from approaching the sagheera to put out the fire 
the sagheera is managed by avin international bunkers supply sa 
based in piraeus greece lloyds said 
on april 4 when the iraniraq war was still raging iranian 
gunboats attacked the sagheera setting it afire near the strait of 
hormuz 
on that occasion the fire was put out and none of the crew was 
injured it was not known whether the same crew was still aboard the 
tanker 
the strait of hormuz was a major area for the socalled tanker 
war an offshoot of the iraniraq war during which 546 commercial 
vessels of different nationalities were attacked by either side 
iran and iraq accepted a unsponsored ceasefire in august 
earlier today bad weather forced the moajil5 a small 
honduranflagged freighter to run aground after it broke anchor in 
the rough seas sources in the gulf and in london said no 
casualties were reported 
a salvage tug the smit sumatera answered a distress call from 
the 9724ton freighter as it drifted off sharjah during the night 
but the tug could not get close enough to help and the moajil5 
grounded on the jetty of sharjah harbor lloyds said 
the moajil5 one of several ships trapped in iraqs gulf port of 
umm qasr during the war was formerly managed by the kuwaitbased 
united arab shipping co

six former city health department employees and 
three private consultants were convicted today of demanding payoffs 
from restaurant owners to overlook health code inspections 
the federal jury in brooklyn deliberated over nine days following 
six weeks of testimony which included descriptions of roach and 
rodentinfested restaurants that were allowed to stay open in return 
for payoffs to inspectors 
each defendant was convicted of racketeering racketeering 
conspiracy and numerous counts of extortion they face up to 20 
years in prison on each racketeering count at sentencing later this 
year 
the defendants who were among 46 people arrested in the scheme 
represented a small slice of the widespread systemic corruption 
uncovered at the city department of health said assistant us 
attorney sean oshea 
they didnt care about rats or mice in restaurants or about 
people getting poisoned or filthy restaurants they cared about 
money oshea told the jury 
more than 40 restaurant owners or managers testified at the 
trial victims of the extortion authorities said ranged from 
delicatessens and fastfood restaurants to expensive manhattan 
eateries 
thirtyseven of the defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy 
before the start of the trial nov 14 and about a dozen of them 
testified for the prosecution 
the inspectors kicked back a portion of the money to their 
supervisors and used hand signals and special code words in asking 
for payoffs oshea said 
the consultants who were hired by restaurants to prepare for 
inspections were accused as acting as middlemen who passed payoffs 
from restaurants to inspectors 
among those on trial was lawrence dewindt a former senior 
inspector who was accused of taking payments of 400 to 450 to keep 
a restaurants name off of a list of restaurants with violations 
published in the local newspapers 
the case was the result of a twoyear undercover investigation by 
the city department of investigation and the fbi

a soviet general today gave his countrys first 
acknowledgement that libya may be able to manufacture chemical 
weapons but said they would be in quantities too small for waging 
war 
as recently as wednesday night staterun radio moscow rejected 
as groundless us charges that libya has built a chemical 
weapons plant south of tripoli 
a spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry meanwhile said news 
of the confrontation wednesday in which us navy jets shot down two 
libyan fighters above the mediterranean was received with 
indignation in moscow 
libyas ambassador to rome linked the incident to us charges 
that his country had built a chemical weapons plant about 60 miles 
southwest of tripoli 
in an interview last month president reagan said he could not 
rule out a military strike on the plant which libya says makes 
pharmaceuticals 
us officials in washington speaking on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday they believe the libyan plant has already begun 
production 
lt gen anatoly kuntsevich deputy chief of soviet chemical 
weapons troops told reporters in moscow today that libya doesnt 
have the industrial capacity to make toxic agents in sufficient 
quantities to conduct warfare 
but as far as a few kilograms of toxic agents goes any serious 
chemical laboratory in the world can make several kilos say one to 
five kilos 22 to 11 pounds of toxic agents 
kuntsevich spoke at a news briefing called to discuss a fiveday 
international conference on chemical weapons that begins saturday in 
paris secretary of state george p shultz plans to use the meeting 
to try to persuade more that 100 nations to impose sanctions on 
countries that use poison gas 
asked if an attack on the libyan plant at rabta could pose a 
danger to the more than 820000 residents of tripoli by releasing 
toxic agents kuntsevich said as far as i know this is a 
pharmaceutical plant if there is an attack there would be much 
physical destruction 
if they use chemical substances there would be some harm to 
the local population the twostar general added but as far as 
i know this is not a large plant and so there would be no danger 
for residents of the capital 
the tass news agency quoted soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov as saying news that washingtons antilibyan 
campaign had produced an armed clash over the mediterranean as a 
result of which two libyan planes were brought down has been 
received with indignation in moscow 
it said gerasimov called us actions a show of political 
adventurism and state terrorism 
gerasimov said the soviet union was not asked to help libya and 
did not increase its state of military readiness 
kuntsevich said soviet chemical weapons forces which the 
pentagon says number between 45000 and 60000 troops do not send 
advisers to other countries and thus have none in libya 
in 1987 the soviet union acknowledged for the first time that it 
possesses chemical weapons and said its stocks of toxic agents do 
not exceed 50000 tons western military specialists estimate soviet 
chemical weapons stocks at between 300000 and 700000 tons figures 
kuntsevich called a myth 
nikita smidovich a foreign ministry official told the briefing 
his country will propose in paris that un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar be empowered to conduct an investigation as soon as 
information about the use of chemical weapons is received 
the 1925 geneva protocol under review in paris bans the use of 
chemical weapons but does not outlaw their production and has no 
enforcement mechanism 
smidovich indicated the kremlin will resist any attempt to 
transform the paris meeting into a forum to condemn libya or any 
other single nation 
the soviets are seeking an agreement that calls for all nations 
including the superpowers to liquidate chemical weapons stocks over 
a 10year period 
the united states ceased manufacture of such weapons in 1969 but 
resumed 17 years later on the grounds the soviets and other 
potential adversaries have chemical weapons stocks

the national transportation safety board ruled 
officially today that the 1987 crash of a pacific southwest airlines 
jet was caused by an attack by a gunwielding passenger 
psa flight 1771 crashed dec 7 l987 about l75 miles northwest of 
los angeles killing all 43 people aboard including a former usair 
employee who had opened fire with a revolver in a revenge attack 
aimed at a former supervisor who also was on board 
authorities within weeks of the crash disclosed that the former 
airline employee david burke had smuggled a 44caliber magnum 
revolver through a security checkpoint at los angeles international 
airport when boarding the flight to san francisco 
a cockpit recorder tape from the plane included gunshots in or 
near the cockpit according to the ntsb the board said in a brief 
summary of findings that the tape revealed the sounds of a scuffle 
and several shots which were apparently fired in or near the 
cockpit 
it has been presumed that both the pilot and copilot likely were 
shot 
according to the ntsb findings the official probable cause for 
the accident were interference and intentional sabotage by 
an emotionally distraught passenger 
the safety board cited as contributing factors inadequate 
security and inadequate operatoring procedures by the airline that 
permitted burke to bypass security at the los angeles airport 
because of his previous employment 
the accident prompted the federal aviation administration to 
order a tightening of security measures taken at passenger 
checkpoints so that there is a closer scrutiny of airline and 
airport employees 
in an action that grew out of the psa accident the faa on 
wednesday announced a final regulation aimed at tightening access to 
restricted areas of an airport by the use of computerized 
identification badges such badges would make an id card ineffective 
if it is reported stolen or if a person leaves employment without 
returning the badge 
investigators have said burke was believed to have still had his 
usair identification badge at the time he boarded flight 1771 
according to the psa investigation it is believed burke was able 
to avoid detection of his revolver because he bypassed normal 
passenger security checks after being recognized as a former airline

the united states today accused libya of lying 
to the world community and said it had photographic evidence that 
the two mig jet fighters shot down wednesday were armed and 
approaching navy jets with hostile intent 
a navy intelligence review of videotape shot by one of the f14 
tomcat jets tells me that the libyan ambassador to the un is a 
liar thats the first thing it tells me said dan howard the 
pentagons chief spokesman 
theyve gone out yesterday and said repeatedly that those were 
unarmed reconnaissance aircraft well we have the pictures now that 
they were not unarmed aircraft howard told a news briefing 
they were obviously armed aircraft with obvious hostile intent 
we believe that our aircraft commanders behaved in a prudent manner 
in defending themselves in defending their aircraft and in 
defending their ship he said 
howard said one of the navy jets twoman air crews had been 
flown to washington overnight and brought the video footage shot by 
the jets target camera 
debriefing of the two officers and a review of the video footage 
shows the mig23 flogger aircraft ignored evasive maneuvers by the 
navy jets five times and kept turning toward the americans howard 
said 
even after the lead f14 had fired two sparrow missiles the two 
migs did not break off their approach he said but turned and tried 
to jump on the second f14 the spokesman said 
the first two sparrows apparently did not strike their target 
but a third sparrow fired by the second f14 claimed one of the 
migs and the lead f14 pounced on the rear of the other mig and 
downed it with a heatseeking sidewinder missile howard said 
by the time the confrontation was over the planes had come as 
close as 15 miles of each other he said 
the american pilots did not have any indication that the libyans 
had turned on their attack radars he said but intercepted radio 
communications show the libyans had some type of radar on their 
planes operating and searching for the f14s howard said 
given the manner in which the libyans were flying the american 
pilots did not need evidence of a radar lockon to know that 
they were in danger howard added 
in offering other details on the confrontation howard said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
wednesdays confrontation was peculiar in several respects 
not the least being that the two libyan fighters did not report back 
to their ground controllers that the american jets had locked on 
them with their own radars at a range of 72 miles 
that is a normal procedure used by navy pilots to warn away other 
planes always in the past howard said when a libyan pilot knew he 
was locked on he would report that and then be directed to return 
home the closest previous approach by a libyan fighter was 30 miles 
no effort was made by the americans to communicate by radio with 
the libyans the f14s did not have compatible radio equipment and 
the e2c radar sentry plane that was also airborne did not try 
there was not enough time to make such an attempt and such tries at 
radio communication are not standard procedure when dealing with 
libya 
from takeoff to shoot down the entire incident lasted only eight 
minutes howard said 
frankly were still scratching our heads as to why libya did 
this he said 
the pentagon has not ordered any special alert status for its 
forces around the world the aircraft carrier kennedy from which 
the f14s flew is now long out of range of libya and proceeding 
toward a port call 
the pentagon still has no information on the fate of the two 
libyan pilots two parachutes were spotted as was a libyan 
searchandrescue helicopter but there is no confirmation as yet 
that the two libyans were fished from the water

two emergency blood transfusions failed to raise 
emperor hirohitos blood pressure today leading to fears that 
prolonged internal bleeding may have sapped the ailing monarchs 
strength officials said 
the 87yearold emperor was administered 172 pints of blood in 
two transfusions during the day but his systolic blood pressure 
remained at 74 by evening imperial household agency spokesman kenji 
maeda said 
an average systolic or upper blood pressure reading is about 
120 low pressure for sustained periods can lead to permanent damage 
of the brain and internal organs 
the emperors blood pressure dropped suddenly early today and he 
was immediately given the first transfusion maeda said the second 
came in the late afternoon 
the low blood pressure indicates hirohito continues to lose blood 
internally and although no discharges were reported today 
doctors fear the emperor is weakening and are focusing their 
efforts on lifting his blood pressure the official said 
previously doctors concentrated on averting large blood losses but 
now the emperor might not have enough energy to discharge a large 
amount of blood he added 
transfusions have been a major treatment since the emperor fell 
ill in midseptember and as of this evening he has received 6783 
pints of blood 
failure of transfusions to raise the emperors blood pressure 
could prove critical and fatal according to a surgeon at a 
private hospital who requested he not be further identified 
hirohito the worlds longestreigning monarch has discharged 
blood intermittently since sept 19 doctors believe the 
hemorrhaging originates in the upper intestinal region where 
hirohito underwent bypass surgery in september 1987 
in another development today police arrested a 25yearold 
rightist armed with a knife as he tried to hand the mayor of 
nagasaki a note protesting his recent comments about the emperor 
masato saito a member of a rightist organization thunder 
academy tried to hand a note to mayor hitoshi motoshima saying 
the slander against the emperor violates the constitution and 
motoshima should resign from his post immediately an official of 
the nagasaki municipal police said 
motoshima said at a municipal assembly meeting last month that 
hirohito bore responsibility for world war ii triggering a storm of 
criticism among rightwing supporters of the ailing monarch

the illinois appellate court has allowed a man 
who strangled his wife in front of their two daughters to retain 
custody of the children 
no law or prior case supported overruling a lowercourt decision 
granting custody to james lutgen 34 of east dubuque the 
threejudge panel said in a decision issued last week 
im glad to have my children home for good now lutgen said 
of his daughters tracy 12 and dana 10 i know that im a good 
parent 
just because somebody does something wrong doesnt mean he 
should lose custody of his children permanently he said 
lutgen pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the 1984 death of his 
26yearold wife carol and was released in 1986 after serving 13 
months of a fouryear sentence 
the sisters witnessed the fight between their parents that 
resulted in mrs lutgens death 
the appeals court ruled that except for his wifes death lutgen 
had an unblemished record 
the victims brother gene tranel of eldridge iowa had sought 
to prevent the girls from being turned over to their father tranel 
took them in when lutgen was arrested 
tranel said he is not sure if can afford to appeal the case to 
the illinois supreme court 
the court system and now even the appellate system has failed 
to protect battered women and innocent victims tranel said it 
appears the courts are not willing to deal with domestic violence

a 3yearold girl who wanted to see her 
grandmother in london got on an airport bus toddled through israeli 
security and passport checks and boarded a europebound flight 
before being discovered her father said 
graham hodson confirmed newspaper accounts published thursday 
about the adventure by his daughter candy 10 days ago at the uvda 
air force base which is used for tourist flights between europe and 
the red sea resort of eilat 
we were quite surprised but not that surprised because shes 
done these kind of things before shes really quite independent 
said hodson a guitarist from liverpool england 
candy slipped away from her father in the lobby of a large hotel 
where hodsons rock group shazam has been playing 
she boarded a charter bus with a group of departing tourists and 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post said she did not attract 
attention because she was one of many blond children 
apparently she was befriended by a woman on the bus who gave 
her some chewing gum everybody stuffed her with sweets hodson 
said 
at the airport she got by all the security checks because we 
travel a lot and shes familiar with airports and she finds it a 
lot of fun he said 
candy wound up on a charter flight bound for copenhagen denmark 
her presence was discovered only after the plane was readying for 
takeoff 
there was a passenger screaming to get on the plane and they 
started checking whether there was someone aboard without a 
ticket hodson said 
candy said nothing she was seated between two strangers and each 
thought she belonged to the other the jerusalem post said she was 
picked up and taken from passenger to passenger no one claimed her 
they took her off the plane crying hodson said 
candy was asleep by the time a taxi brought her back to the hotel 
five hours after she disappeared 
the next morning she mumbled to us that she had wanted to 
visit her grandmother we told her off but we couldnt really 
discipline her hodson said adding he and his wife searched the 
resort grounds and a nearby beach for three hours before airport 
security officials called the hotel 
after initially being upset by lax security hodson decided to 
take the incident with a sense of humor 
it wasnt her first sign of wanderlust when she was two candy 
wandered without clothes about a mile away from her home in tenerife 
in the canary islands 
she reached the supermarket she took a baby bottle with 
chocolate and a bag of crisps potato chips shes getting to be 
famous for her independence said hodson

defense secretary frank c carlucci announced 
today he had approved a recommendation to close dozens of military 
bases across the country calling the action long overdue 
carlucci declared at a pentagon briefing the department has 
wanted to close bases for many years i would like to reiterate 
that this is a unique opportunity to make significant changes to 
the departments base structure which will not only save taxpayer 
dollars but also improve our nations defense 
he said he would ask congress for 500 million in the fiscal 1990 
budget and another 500 million in the 1991 budget to help cover 
expenses of closing military bases 
carlucci also said he would like to see even more bases closed 
but wasnt about to tamper with the political compromise that 
produced the current closing list he added that the defense 
department might be able to close some of the bases even more 
quickly than envisioned by the special commission that prepared the 
list 
base closings are long overdue carlucci said 
adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
told reporters that he and the other leaders of the armed services 
supported the closures 
it is our view as a body that this action would not adversely 
affect military operations or the ability to carry out the national 
military strategy crowe said 
carluccis decision which was expected sets the stage for one 
final debate on the matter on capitol hill 
under a law passed last year a special government commission was 
given the authority to review all military facilities and to prepare 
a hit list of those considered obsolete or unnecessary 
now that carlucci has endorsed the panels recommendations 
congress must either accept or reject the list of bases proposed for 
closure in its entirety it cannot pick and choose or bargain over 
the fate of individual bases on the list 
the commission known formally as the base realignment and 
closure commission has recommended that 34 military installations 
and 52 military housing complexes be closed that five other 
installations be partially closed and that 54 others get new 
missions or additional personnel 
all told the panel has estimated the actions would save 693 
million a year

three african students held by police in 
connection with a brawl that triggered racial unrest in four cities 
have admitted they broke the law an official report said thursday 
one of the three remained under arrest in the eastern city of 
nanking apparently facing trial while two others were being 
punished with 15 days of disciplinary detention the xinhua news 
agency said 
a fourth african was released and returned to his school thursday 
night the report said 
in related developments about 45 african students held 10 days 
at a guesthouse following the brawl returned to their university in 
nanking on thursday 
in hangzhou about 150 miles to the southeast african students 
ended a 10day class boycott after their colleges president agreed 
to give them a direct telephone line and write an open letter saying 
none had aids 
one african country warned it might recall its students because 
of the treatment of african students 
besides hangzhou and nanking racial incidents have occurred in 
beijing and wuhan an industrial city in central china 
the incidents began dec 24 in nanking when african students 
refused to register their chinese girlfriends to attend a dance at 
hehai university the disagreement led to a fight and nearly a week 
of antiafrican protests by chinese youths 
xinhua said alex dosoo of ghana beat and seriously hurt a 
university worker during the brawl he was the only african to be 
arrested 
the news agency said alpha robinson of gambia and dossoumou boni 
lodovic of benin tried to stir up trouble during the fight and 
were being given 15 days detention under chinas public order 
regulations all three admitted they broke the law it said without 
elaborating 
the four were among about 140 students most from africa who 
tried to flee to beijing in the face of the chinese protests but 
were taken by police to a guest house outside nanking and held 
incommunicado 
the four were taken into custody saturday at the guest house by 
about 400 police who according to fellow students and african 
diplomats used electric cattle prods and wooden clubs chinese 
officials deny any violence was used 
police brought most of the other students back to nanking but 45 
remained at the guest house until thursday when they returned to 
school voluntarily in order to meet with a group of african 
diplomats 
hehai students said thursday that hundreds more paramilitary 
police had flooded the guest house sunday 
police were everywhere in the building in the corridors on 
the landings in the lounges and on some balconies said carl 
ameho of ghana 
he said students were prohibited from making telephone calls and 
could only go outside to walk to the dining hall 
it was a real jail ameho said 
some students said that on their first day back at hehai 
university chinese students yelled black devil youve 
returned and black devil get lost 
we are still very scared here said a student from gambia 
today i rode outside the university and came home quickly because 
so many people were calling me a black devil he said 
ameho said liang ruiju hehais president met with african 
students and told them that under the universitys new regulations 
africans must introduce their chinese girlfriends to university 
officials 
chinese women can lose their jobs or be subjected to ridicule if 
they openly have relationships with foreign men 
in hangzhou a conflict at zhejiang agricultural college was 
resolved with authorities making concessions to the african students 
for the first time 
african students said the trouble in hangzhou began when chinese 
telephone operators told chinese callers that all the africans had 
aids the university has denied the allegation 
in beijing on thursday african students at the beijing languages 
institute continued a class boycott triggered by chinese allegations 
that a black student accosted a chinese woman in her room 
in wuhan the hubei province foreign affairs office acknowledged 
that chinese students threw rocks at foreign student dormitories 
last week it said a sri lankan student at central china 
polytechnical college was injured by glass from a broken window dec 
29 
in ghana the staterun radio station reported that the 
government may recall the 26 ghanian students soudying in china 
diplomats from ghana and benin said chinas handling of the 
incidents could damage sinoafrican ties 
the way this is going this could lead to something very 
nasty said a diplomat from benin 
china denies all charges of racial prejudice and expresses pride 
at its longestablished policy of showing solidarity with the third 
world by giving scholarships to african students there are about 
1500 african students from 40 nations now in china 
africans complain that they are subject to racial discrimination 
and social contacts between african men and chinese women are a 
frequent source of tension 
chinese also resent the fact that africans many from countries 
as poor as china receive far better food and lodging than chinese 
students

a woman drowned her oldest daughter in a 
bathtub shot her three other children to death then killed 
herself authorities said 
ive been in law enforcement for 19 years and this is the most 
gruesome thing i have ever seen sheriff robert nall said after 
wednesdays grim events in this tiny town near the missouri border 
the bodies were discovered when the father greg epker returned 
home from work at a sign company in nearby quincy authorities said 
epker 32 found that his oldest daughter 8yearold casey had 
been drowned that daughters shannon 5 and mandy 2 and his son 
lance 1 had been shot and that his wife sheila 27 had shot 
herself nall said 
epker was being treated for shock at st marys hospital in 
quincy nall said 
the killings apparently occurred wednesday afternon nall said 
all but the eldest child apparently died without a struggle he said 
at this point we have found no motive nall said it was a 
spontaneous event and we dont know what happened we may never 
know exactly the sheriff said epker is completely mystified 
as well 
mrs epker apparently first tried to strangle her oldest daughter 
before drowning the child nall said 
authorities believe the woman then took her other children into 
the kitchen where she laid out pillows and blankets and turned on a 
gas stove in an attempt to asphyxiate the family 
we believe that because that didnt work quickly enough 
because of despair she took them into the living room one by one 
and shot them with a handgun their father kept on a closet shelf 
out of their reach nall said 
mendon with a population of nearly 1000 is nearly 140 miles 
northwest of st louis 
weve got a grocery a gas station a bank and variety store 
thats pretty much mendon except for one oil company that services 
the local area said mayor gene rogers 
its just a small town where everythings based on agriculture 
and everybody pretty much knows everybody else 
you just cant imagine anyone doing anything like that said 
ron durk who owns the towns bowling alley and lives a few yards 
from the epkers something had to snap 
we didnt know them too much durk said wed just see her 
out there in the yard with the kids in the summertime something 
like this is unbelievable 
neighbors said the family had lived in mendon for about seven 
years 
they were sweet little children said durks wife doris i 
used to see the little girls out in the yard and they would wave at 
me

skating on houston streets can be expensive it 
cost one urban animals club member 50 in fines and officials said 
more busts of skateboarders and roller skaters are planned 
its a dumb law said alex siegel foreman of the municipal 
court jury that on wednesday convicted kenneth william hessler for 
illegal skating we found him guilty because thats what the law 
says 
the maximum fine for skating on city streets is 200 under a 
20yearold ordinance 
i think our police officers have more important things to do 
than enforce this law said councilman dale gorczynski id 
rather see them busting crack houses 
but city officials say this was the first in what is expected to 
be a flurry of such trials including another one for hessler for 
allegedly skating in the street on halloween 
most defendants are part of a looseknit group called the urban 
animals who have skated on downtown streets since 1978 
john mckay owner of the montrose skate shop and a member of the 
urban animals said the group will continue skating downtown and 
hopes any future confrontations will help result in a change in the 
ordinance the group skates mostly downtown but it is illegal to 
skate on streets any place in the city 
hundreds of the skaters petitioned city council in 1987 to let 
them ride on streets similar to bicyclists council however said 
skaters pose a threat to themselves on the streets

nearly 30 journalists who flew to libya 
after us warplanes shot down two libyan fighter jets over the 
mediterranean sea were detained at tripoli airport today then sent 
back to rome 
earlier today residents fleeing tripoli reportedly jammed gas 
stations and troops fortified the home of col moammar gadhafi after 
his government claimed the downing of the libyan jets on wednesday 
was a prelude to a major attack 
us officials said two armed libyan jets were downed after they 
approached two navy fighters with hostile intent the libyans said 
its planes were unarmed and on a reconnaissance flight when they 
were fired upon for no reason 
at least one of reporters turned back at tripoli airport today 
had been invited to libya by a government official 
the journalists who arrived from rome spent about 1 hours 
inside the airport terminal before being put back on the flight 
the regularly scheduled alitalia flight carried about 30 
journalists mostly europeans and other passengers including 
businessmen and libyan citizens the flight left rome at 1205 pm 
two hours behind schedule and landed in tripoli at 145 pm 
libyan officials gathered the passports of all the journalists 
and led them into a room in the arrival area 
about 15 or 20 minutes later the journalists were told they were 
being sent back to rome and they were asked to present their baggage 
checks so their luggage could be identified and put back on the 
flight 
one libyan in civilian clothes who wouldnt identify himself said 
repeatedly in italian if you dont have a visa you cant stay 
you must go back to rome 
the only reporter allowed in was a correspondent for the italian 
news agency ansa the agency has an arrangement with libya which 
allows its correspondent to enter the country whenever he wants and 
the reporter visits libya several times a year 
libya officially requires a visa from americans and western 
europeans but sometimes journalists have been allowed in without 
visas including an associated press reporter in april 1988 
on wednesday the associated press office in rome received a 
telex from ali maria the head of the information ministry division 
which deals with foreign press telling the news agency its reporter 
was welcome to come to libya 
the ap reporter showed the telex written in english to at least 
half a dozen libyans in civilian clothes at the airport but to no 
avail 
one official agreed to telephone ali maria but the man came back 
a short time later and said theres nothing to be done 
alitalia officials and libyans ordered the journalists to get 
back on the plane but the reporters protested for about 45 minutes 
finally with the help of two unarmed libyans in army fatigues 
the journalists were led back onto the plane an italian newspaper 
reporter who has been to libya before and was particularly 
insistent about entering the country was pushed by libyan airport 
officials 
the plane returned to rome and landed at about 5 pm 
an aide to ali maria contacted by phone from rome at the 
ministry office said we have stopped letting in journalists we 
have 200 journalists now 
he indicated that they too would be sent back soon 
a spokesman for the libyan embassy in rome asked about the 
journalists being turned back said the embassy received a telex 
today from ali maria saying not to issue any more visas the telex 
according to the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
said that libya would not let in any more journalists because all 
the hotels are full

included businesses and government bodies that provided equipment 
and assistance and the officers and crews of two soviet icebreakers

what can happen when the soviet union and the united states 
cooperate together to make something happen said commerce 
secretary c william verity 
accepting plaques on behalf of the soviet icebreakers was 
ambassador yuri dubinin who called the rescue effort an 
extraordinary event of the year 
it was the easiest sovietamerican negotiations because from 
both sides immediately it was yes to organizing this 
cooperation dubinin said now we can see that this type of 
icebreaker diplomacy is useful for all relationships between the 
soviet union and the united states and for the whole world 
one of the three trapped gray whales died but after nearly two 
weeks of rescue efforts two others apparently swam free of the ice 
on oct 28 the rescue was coordinated by the commerce departments

the russian orthodox church for decades 
subservient to a hostile soviet government said on the eve of its 
christmas celebration thursday it is seeking rehabilitation of 
priests and lay believers persecuted since the bolshevik revolution 
church officials told the official news agency tass that they had 
decided to form a commission to gather material on persecuted 
believers 
the action signaled another cautious move by church leaders to 
take advantage of the freer atmosphere presented by the reforms of 
president mikhail s gorbachev who met in april 1988 with patriarch 
pimen to ask the churchs support for his reforms and promise legal 
changes reflecting a new attitude toward religion 
orthodox christians mark christmas on jan 7 but religious 
celebrations begin on christmas eve and last through the night 
a commission of the communist party politburo is reviewing cases 
of soviet citizens who were killed or imprisoned under josef stalin 
and secular scholars and artists are leading an effort to build a 
monument to stalins millions of victims 
but the tass announcement said the churchs holy synod or ruling 
council has raised the issue of rehabilitating clergy and laymen 
repressed after the 1917 revolution and decided to form a special 
commission to study related material 
that takes the churchs review back to the rule of soviet founder 
vladimir i lenin who unlike stalin still is regarded in the soviet 
union with nearreligious reverence 
it was in the first years of the revolution prior to the advent 
of stalins rule in 1924 that some of the most severe repression 
against the church took place 
writer vladimir soloukhin in a letter published in the december 
issue of the monthly nash sovremenik said the number of priests 
dropped from 360000 before the revolution to 40000 at the end of 
1919 two years later 
most of the 54000 churches that existed before the revolution 
were torn down or coverted into warehouses factories or turned to 
other uses 
tass said the question of rehabilitation had been discussed by 
the holy synod on nov 30 and dec 27 it said the commission would 
begin its work immediately after being formally approved at the next 
synod meeting it did not say when that would be 
it said the russian orthodox church was inviting anyone with 
material that should be considered to send it to church headquarters 
in moscow 
stalin had thousands of the remaining priests shot or sent to 
labor camps or exile and in 1929 imposed strict laws that requires 
all religious groups be registered by the government and prohibits 
religious organizations from educating the young or conducting 
charitable activities 
religious dissidents have demanded the russian orthodox church 
recognize the injustice of the purges and canonize some of those 
killed in purges after the revolution but a list of new saints 
approved by the church for festivities marking its 1000th 
anniversary which was celebrated in june refrained from that 
neither the church nor the government releases figures on the 
number of russian orthdox believers among the more than 280 million 
people in the soviet union but the figure is believed to be in the 
tens of millions 
for more than a year gorbachev whose mother is reported to be a 
regular churchgoer and soviet officials have been promising a new 
law on freedom of conscience that they say will ease many of the 
restrictions on religious activity russian orthodox church 
officials say they are helping prepare the law tacitly 
acknowledging they consider many of the restrictions unfair 
in recent months officials have been allowing religious 
organizations to conduct some minor charity work sisters of nobel 
peace prize winner mother teresas missionaries of charity were 
permitted to come to the soviet union to care for those injured in 
the dec 7 armenian earthquake 
the weekly moscow news reported in its latest edition released 
thursday that seventh day adventists were helping repair a school in 
the village of zaoksky south of moscow

the soviet ambassador said today that 
moscow had warned the united states to show restraint and not to 
raise the tension with libya before us jet fighters shot down 
two libyan aircraft 
the united states told the security council its planes opened 
fire on the libyan jets in reaction to hostile actions that 
constituted an armed attack on american forces 
us ambassador herbert s okun made the statement in a letter to 
the 15member council which held private consultations on libyas 
protest of the us downing of the jets over the mediterranean sea 
on wednesday 
libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser requested the meeting 
saying without a doubt we will ask for condemnation of this 
premeditated act of aggression the two libyan mig23s he said 
were unarmed on routine reconnaissance ordinary flying it was 
an innocent flight 
in washington us officials accused libya of lying and said it 
had photographic evidence the jet fighters were armed and 
approaching navy jets with hostile intent 
a navy intelligence review of videotape shot by one of the f14 
tomcat jets tells me that the libyan ambassador to the un is a 
liar thats the first thing it tells me dan howard the 
pentagons chief spokesman told a news briefing 
the united nations soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov 
told reporters after the security council consultations that the 
soviet union was worried about tension in the region over us 
allegations that libya is building a chemical weapons plant 
but before that wednesdays incident we gave a warning 
signal to washington to show restraint in that area not to raise 
the tension in the area belonogov said refusing to elaborate 
we deplore this accident belonogov added it shows the 
seriousness of the situation and that all military personnel should 
be under strong instructions not to be too quick to pull the 
trigger 
when asked about his use of the word accident he said well 
everything that has a tragic ending is an accident 
earlier he told reporters the us attack could provoke very 
grave consequences 
but okun speaking as he entered the consultations said the 
event is a closed incident 
the session considered libyas request for a condemnation of the 
us action a formal session of the council the most powerful un 
body was scheduled later 
us forces have exercised their inherent right of selfdefense 
under international law by taking defensive action in response to 
hostile actions constituting an armed attack by the military forces 
of libya against us forces said the letter from okun 
it said the us aircraft were engaged in a routine training 
operation when two libyan aircraft without provocation approached 
them in a hostile manner 
after repeatedly attempting to disengage by taking evasive 
measures the letter said the american aircraft acting in 
selfdefense fired upon and shot down the two libyan aircraft 
it said the council should be aware of the gravity of libyas 
action 
belonogov said the incident was the result of the 
overconcentration of american forces in the mediterranean on one 
hand and the enemy image of libya that exists in this country on the 
other 
he also said there was no proof a libyan chemical plant was being 
built to manufacture chemical weapons and that a libyan invitation 
to the united states to inspect the plant should be taken 
seriously the united states rejected the libyan offer 
in moscow today a soviet general anatoly kuntsevich said libya 
may be able to manufacture chemical weapons but they would be in 
quantities too small for waging war 
any security council resolution critical of the united states was 
expected to be vetoed by the us delegation and possibly by its 
allies britain and france all permanent members with veto power on 
the council 
the soviet union and china also can kill resolutions 
in 1986 when the united states attacked libya with air strikes 
to punish it for allegedly providing logistical support for 
terrorist attacks many un members protested and libya went to the 
security council 
but a resolution of condemnation was blocked then by vetos from 
the united states britain and france

soldiers today forced 
residents to paint over graffiti threatening the life of mayor elias 
freij whose proposal for a unsponsored truce in the palestinian 
uprising was rejected by the plo 
freij denied reports he was in hiding following plo chairman 
yasser arafats statement that anyone trying to stop the uprising 
exposes himself to the bullets of our people arafat made the 
comment at a rally jan 1 in saudi arabia marking the anniversary of 
his fatah movement 
i cannot believe he arafat said that freij said in a 
telephone interview from his office 
also today 15 palestinians ranging in age from 15 to 37 were 
wounded in clashes with troops in the gaza strip refugee camp of 
shati arab hospital officials said 
palestinians in the west bank town of jericho said a 25yearold 
resident gunned down near his house wednesday was suspected of 
collaborating with israeli authorities 
army officials confirmed the death of bassam barahmeh who died 
in a hospital but said they had no information on his activities 
the officials said they were checking reports that 15 palestinians 
were wounded 
leaders of the uprising have repeatedly threatened palestinians 
who cooperate with israel and more than a dozen alleged 
collaborators have been killed since the unrest began in december 
1987 
barahmehs death brought to 347 the number of palestinians killed 
in the uprising fourteen israelis have died 
near bethlehems manger square dozens of armed israeli soldiers 
took identity cards from shopkeepers and palestinian youths and 
ordered them to paint over antifreij slogans 
the threats were signed by the popular front for the liberation 
of palestine a marxist faction of the plo and included shame on 
all traitors and death to all those who forsake the cause 
freij today denied as absolutely groundless reports that he 
went into hiding or hired bodyguards after the threats appeared 
early in the week 
i have been in my office working normally yesterday wednesday 
and today and will be tomorrow too he said 
efforts to reach freij on tuesday night and wednesday were not 
successful his aides said he was not in his office wednesday 
afternoon and freij changed his home telephone number an 
associated press reporter was turned away from the freij home 
wednesday evening 
freij who returned an ap call today said the death threats 
against him are absolutely meaningless 
he claimed they were signed by hamas an antiplo moslem 
fundamentalist group but an arabicspeaking reporter clearly saw 
the signature of the front a plo faction 
freij said he accepted the plos rejection of his truce proposal 
which he linked to israel releasing 5000 arab prisoners and 
reopening universities but said he was not withdrawing the idea 
i have the right to make suggestions and the plo has the right 
as our representatives to make decisions they made such a decision 
and i fully respect that he said 
freij said he never supported a unilateral ceasefire and 
supports continued antiisraeli protests until occupation ends or 
peace talks start 
also today finance minister shimon peres presented an economic 
austerity plan to the cabinet to cut 611 million from the nations 
52 billion budget including 67 million from the defense budget 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the army will have to shift 
about 83 million from existing military programs to cover expenses 
stemming from the uprising he said he was agreeing to the plan 
because he couldnt ignore israels economic problems 
the arabiclanguage newspaper al shaab said a joint plojordanian 
committee would meet in amman on saturday to discuss emergency 
payments to thousands of former palestinian employees of jordan in 
the west bank 
the threeday meeting was to be attended by arafat and jordanian 
prime minister zaid rifai said the newspaper published in arab 
east jerusalem 
the employees including teachers and civil servants lost their 
salaries after jordans king hussein announced july 31 that he would 
sever all administrative ties with the west bank 
mohammed milhem a plo member of the committee told the ap in 
amman that funds for the project had not yet been secured and that 
no firm date for the meeting had been set

six men accused of funneling 
mercenaries and supplies to the contra rebels argued before a judge 
thursday they are innocent of neutrality act charges because the 
united states was waging war with nicaragua 
us district judge norman roettger who also heard testimony on 
the socalled at peace issue dec 2 as part of a defense motion 
to dismiss the indictment said he expected decide the matter within 
days 
in the first half of the continuing pretrial hearing last month 
the defendants argued that the neutrality act applies only to 
nations with which the united states is at peace they contend the 
reagan administration was running a de facto war against nicaraguas 
sandinista government at the time of their activities 
thursdays first defense witness was former top cia analyst david 
macmichael who testified that during his 198183 tenure the agency 
organized and directed the contras against nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government 
i would say they the cia had a military mission macmichael 
said not only combat but support supplies transportation 
macmichael testified over prosecution objections they said they 
feared he would disclose cia secrets the judge ruled he could speak 
on matters already in the public record 
outside court defendant mario calero brother of contra leader 
adolfo calero angrily accused the govenrment of harassing the 
indicted men while they await trial he ridiculed the governments 
contention that the united states was at peace with the sandinistas 
when you mine harbors and run the show you are really not 
just de facto at war youre at war calero told reporters 
perhaps the united states has not been honest enough with itself 
to up and admit it 
macmichaels testimony thursday sought to back up adolfo caleros 
testimony last month that former national security adviser oliver 
north was providing the rebels with 32 million at the same time the 
defendants were training antisandinista mercenaries 
the defendants also have submitted volumes of the tower report on 
the irancontra affair 
assistant us attorney eric dubelier argued that no declared war 
existed and that north and others are facing indictment for their 
allegedly illegal activities 
in washington independent counsel lawrence walsh citing 
difficult classified information problems moved thursday to 
dismiss the two central charges against north walsh said the move 
was prompted because the reagan administration was refusing to allow 
the release of numerous classified documents north wants to 
introduce in his defense 
the miami group was indicted in june after charges of reagan 
administration footdragging during the highly publicized 
investigation which at one point became the focal point of 
congressional hearings 
opponents of aid to the contras accused thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii of stalling the case because it threatened to 
uncover illegal activities by north 
the miami indictment accuses the group of violating the 
neutrality act by launching operations against the sandinista 
government from us soil from october 1984 to march 1985 
the indictment accuses them of recruiting and training 
mercenaries to fight with contras supplying the rebels with 
equipment leading them on expeditions including one aimed at 
blowing up a nicaraguan bridge and violating firearms laws 
the seven original defentants were thomas posey head of the 
alabamabased civilian materiel assistance group mario calero a 
former supply manager for the rebels joe adams adolfo caleros 
former bodyguard jack terrell a former mercenary who turned 
against the effort and went to authorities maco stewart a wealthy 
former texas businessman and state official who now lives in france 
jose coutin a miami cuban and former cma liaison in florida and 
alex martinez a conservative cubanamerican stockbroker 
adams pleaded guilty and roettger fined him 50 and sentenced 
him to a day of probation the other six defendants continue to 
fight the charges which could result in federal prison sentences of 
up to eight years on the neutrality act violations

residents fleeing tripoli jammed gas 
stations and troops fortified the home of col moammar gadhafi 
whose government claimed the us downing of two libyan jet fighters 
was a prelude to a major attack news reports said 
the foreign ministry summoned heads of west european diplomatic 
missions after wednesdays incident over the mediterranean asking 
them to condemn the us aggression and prevent an escalation in 
tensions the official news agency jana reported 
gadhafi branded the us action an example of increased 
official american terrorism which is backed by brute force the 
agency said 
the libyan leader whom washington accuses of sponsoring 
international terrorism was quoted as declaring the 
revolutionaries of great libya would meet challenge with 
challenge 
the yugoslav news agency tanjug reported from tripoli that 
residents were packing filling stations as they fled the capital 
after learning two libyan fighters had been shot down by us 
warplanes 
gadhafis home was turned into a fortress with antiaircraft 
missiles mounted on its roof tanjug said 
nearly 30 journalists flying from italy to libya were turned back 
at the tripoli airport today and sent back to rome 
a spokesman for the libyan embassy in rome asked about the 
journalists being turned back said the embassy received 
instructions not to issue any more visas the telex said libya would 
not let in any more journalists because all the hotels are full 
said the spokesman who demanded anonymity 
gadhafis compound was a target of the last us military strike 
on libya when aircraft bombed tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 
killing more than 100 people president reagan described the raids 
as retaliation for the bombing of a west berlin disco frequented by 
american servicemen which the united states blamed on terrorists 
sponsored by libya 
two us servicemen and a turkish woman died in the disco bombing 
libya claimed the downing of its fighters wednesday was a 
premeditated attack and a potential precursor to a major assault 
the foreign ministry summoned arab ambassadors in tripoli to ask 
for a unified arab stance against the united states jana said 
the ministry called for an emergency meeting of arab league 
foreign ministers to adopt collective measures for defense and to 
participate with the libyan arab people in the defense of its land 
and existence the agency said 
gadhafi also sent a message to the head of the nonaligned 
movement robert mugabe of zimbabwe asking the group to help stop 
the us aggression and warning of the threat to world 
security posed by american military moves in the mediterranean it 
said 
the reagan administration said the two us fighters acted in 
selfdefense while on routine patrol over international waters but 
the libyan ambassador to rome linked the event to us allegations 
libya has built a chemical weapons factory in rabta 60 miles 
outside tripoli 
the state department denied there was a connection 
gadhafi has said the plants function is to produce medicine and 
jana reported in recent days that libyan doctors and nurses were 
conducting a sitin at the factory in hopes of deterring a us 
attack 
most west european governments have responded with some 
skepticism to allegations the plant is to manufacture chemical 
weapons west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
wednesday his government had no evidence proving a west german 
pharmaceutical firm had helped build it 
britains foreign office said it had independent information 
confirming the rabta plant was constructed to produce chemical 
weapons 
president reagan said last month his advisers were considering 
attacking the plant but the washington post today quoted 
unidentified senior officials in the reagan administration as saying 
the president now opposes a strike because washingtons european 
allies are against the idea 
after the libyan jets were destroyed wednesday gadhafi asked the 
soviet union to move some of its warships in the mediterranean to 
the area in which us vessels are operating near libya tanjug 
reported 
the agencys correspondent one of the few nonarab journalists 
with an office in tripoli has had access to high libyan sources and 
his reports often prove reliable 
a reporter for italian tv said gadhafis residenceheadquarters 
in tripoli already equipped with watchtowers and tanks parked in 
camouflaged garages had been even more heavily fortified 
the italian correspondent said antimissile batteries had been 
placed in key areas he said the government television station was 
one point at which security was notably greater 
he described the reaction as first incredulity then anger 
when word arrived in tripoli that fighters from the us 6th fleet 
had shot down two libyan mig23 jets 
in new york on wednesday libyas un ambassador ali sunni 
muntasser requested an emergency meeting of the security council to 
condemn the us action 
jana quoted the foreign ministry as describing the us naval 
presence in the mediterranean as a smokescreen for a 
largescale aggression to be launched against libyan military 
and economic installations

ronald reagan and his wife have two more weeks 
of living in government quarters on pennsylvania avenue in 
washington before setting up california housekeeping in a 25 
million ranchstyle house modest by neighborhood standards that 
was purchased for them by friends 
during their twoweek christmasnew years vacation which ended 
thursday the president and nancy reagan slept nine nights in the 
house aides said they unpacked boxes hung pictures and drank juice 
squeezed from oranges off their own trees it was their first stay 
the 35yearold singlestory threebedroom sixbathroom 
fourfireplace flagstone house stands behind a wall and security 
fence on a hillside dotted with orange palm and other trees 
it was purchased by a group of 20 friends from whom the reagans 
will lease it for a reported 15000 a month with an option to buy 
at the reagans request its address on the mailbox in front 
was changed last summer from 666 saint cloud drive to 668 because of 
connotations surrounding the number 666 some people believe 666 is 
the symbol of the devil 
despite the sevenfigure price of the reagans new home it is 
overshadowed by others in the posh bel air neighborhood 
the house is the lowmanonthetotempole house in a 
neighborhood where the neighbors include elizabeth taylor and zsa 
zsa gabor said neighbor jeffrey hyland president of the real 
estate firm alvarez hyland amp young 
the house to the west sold for 135 million and the house to 
the east sold for 145 million he said 
he said reagan is following out the real estate rule that you 
always want to buy into a neighborhood on the bottom end adding 
you want to be the cheapest man on the block so every other house 
pulls you up 
unlike houses farther up the hill the new reagan home doesnt 
have much of a view 
all the trees across the way have in the past 25 to 35 years 
blocked it hyland said its amazing every 25 feet you go the 
view is bigger and better theres a house up above them where you 
can see the ocean as well as downtown los angeles 
the reagans house has an outdoor heated swimming pool but the 
weather during their vacation was a bit chilly for swimming 
elaine crispen mrs reagans press secretary said the first 
lady told her that reagan thought that it was a real treat for him 
that he had orange juice from the oranges off their own trees 
mrs reagan told mrs crispen that the president was pleased to 
see that she had been able to get so much done in making the house 
a home even though she was 3000 miles away in washington most of 
the time 
mrs reagan made several visits to the house before their current 
stay 
she would spend an afternoon or so looking at things and 
deciding what she needed and what would have to be done and sort of 
some mental placement of furniture mrs crispen said 
reagan got his first look inside the house on an earlier trip 
when mrs reagan has said she sneaked him past reporters by having 
him crouch in the back seat of a white house car 
on dec 23 when he rode to the house for the first time sitting 
straight up he was quoted by aide mark weinberg as saying im 
awed and i love it 
the reagans have not allowed reporters into the 6500squarefoot 
house hyland said his listings showed it has a drawing room and 
library a dining room a patio with a heated floor a kitchen with 
a walkin cooler and a twobedroom servants wing above a threecar 
garage 
security gear has been installed with television cameras mounted 
on the chimneys and the street blocked off and lined with vans 
trucks and trailers 
i live a block up the street and every time i drive up and 
down its just a mess hyland said this week 
information made available in 1986 to the office of government 
ethics showed that among the friends who bought the house for the 
reagans are holmes tuttle a california automobile dealer and 
industrialist and earle jorgensen chairman of a steel and aluminum 
distribution company both are longtime unofficial advisers of 
reagan each paid at least 156000 the documents showed 
hyland also said he believed the buyers got a bargain he 
estimated the land alone was worth 3 million when they bought it 
and the property is probably worth 5 million now with the 
improvements that have been made the house stands on a lot of just 
over an acre

presidentelect bush is nearing a decision on 
his two remaining cabinetlevel selections but apparently has ruled 
out james schlesinger for energy secretary sources said 
meanwhile sources close to bush who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said that two top contenders for the other unfilled spot 
the newly created job of drug czar are former education secretary 
william j bennett and texas industrialist ross perot 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said today bush had offered him 
the drug post on tuesday but he turned it down in a halfhour 
meeting this morning with the presidentelect deconcini was elected 
in november to a third sixyear term and said he did not want to 
leave the senate so soon after the election 
i am very flattered and humbled by his confidence deconcini 
said at a news conference it was very tempting to me based on my 
interests 
deconcini who was critical of bushs role overseeing antidrug 
efforts for the reagan administration today praised his grasp of 
the issue 
when reminded of his opinions during the presidential campaign 
deconcini replied time has a lot to do with ones attitudes 
deconcini said bush offered him the post tuesday morning before 
capitol hill ceremonies marking the opening of the new congress and 
asked him to keep it confidential the senator said bush released 
him from that pledge this morning 
deconcini suggested a couple of people for the post including 
rep glenn english dokla but bush made no commitment saying he 
had no one else in mind for the job 
schlesinger energy secretary under president carter and defense 
secretary under president ford had earlier been mentioned as a 
leading candidate for the energy post 
the vice president and schlesinger met last week to discuss 
energy issues but the job was not offered said a senior bush 
transition official who insisted upon not being identified 
schlesinger reportedly ran into opposition among influential 
republicans for his ties to the carter administration and an 
abrasive style the sources said 
sources said that former louisiana rep henson moore remained a 
top contender on bushs short list for the energy post 
aides to bush said that while he would like to wrap up his 
cabinet selection as soon as possible it was unlikely any 
additional announcements would come as early as today 
bush on wednesday took obvious delight in his last official duty 
as presiding officer of the senate ruling over a joint session of 
congress convened to count electoral votes the vice president was 
able to formally announce his own presidential victory 
he declared the final tally from the electoral college ballots 
cast last month giving george bush of the state of texas 426 
votes to democratic challenger michael dukakis 111 and a maverick 
electoral vote cast in west virginia for lloyd bentsen for 
president the final tally reflected bushs 40state sweep in the 
november election 
it had been 152 years since a vice president had been able to 
perform such a task grinning broadly bush rapped the gavel and 
declared the joint session dissolved congress will not 
reconvene until jan 20 when bush and vice presidentelect dan 
quayle are inaugurated 
the last vice president to preside over his own presidential 
election certification was martin van buren in 1837 this is only 
the fourth time a sitting vice president has been elected president 
in history the others were john adams george washingtons vice 
president and james madison thomas jeffersons 
the stray vote for bentsen came from west virginia where one 
dukakis elector flipped her ballot putting the texas senator first 
and the massachusetts governor second 
bush injected a note of humor in the roll call when rep frank 
annunzio dill one of four official vote counters announced only 
that arkansas had cast six votes for president 
the chair wonders who won that one bush observed dryly 
as the chamber erupted in laughter and applause annunzio 
responded its obvious that they all know the answer to that 
one 
while on capitol hill bush met privately with sens jesse helms 
rnc and larry pressler rsd and had lunch with rep robert 
dornan rcalif 
dornan an early bush supporter said they discussed both the 
energy and drug posts over turkey sandwiches in the senate dining 
room but that bush did not indicate whom he might select for either 
dornan said he told bush his own choice for drug czar was bennett 
dornan said bush likely invited him to lunch because i was the 
first member of either the house or the senate to endorse him weve 
developed a good relationship

the international ladies garment workers 
union today asked a federal court to prohibit the labor department 
from implementing regulations that would allow homework in five 
apparelrelated industries 
the suit filed in federal district court here argues that labor 
secretary ann mclaughlin acted arbitrarily in approving the 
regulations and that she ignored evidence that there were not 
adequate safeguards in the rules to prevent violations of labor and 
workersafety laws 
the regulations are scheduled to take effect jan 9 it was not 
immediately clear whether there would be a hearing on the complaint 
before then 
the suit also asked that the labor department be ordered to 
reconsider its 1984 decision allowing homework in the knitted 
outerwear industry the department said its success in monitoring 
that industry led it to draft the new regulations but the suit 
contended there has been inadequate monitoring and enforcement of 
homework in the industry 
the five manufacturing industries covered by the new rules are 
gloves and mittens buttons and buckles handkerchiefs embroideries 
and to a limited extent jewelry 
about 167000 workers are employed by the affected industries 
which generated 10 billion worth of production in 1986 according 
to susan cowell vice president of the ilgwu 
joining the garment workers union in filing the suit were two 
other national unions amalgamated clothing and textile workers 
union and service employees international union two newyork based 
locals three apparelindustry groups and the states of new york and 
pennsylvania 
named as defendants were mclaughlin and paula v smith 
administrator of the departments wage and hour division which 
enforces many of the laws the suit contends would be violated if the 
homework regulations are allowed to take effect 
bans on homework in the apparel and related industries date back 
to the 1940s when they were adopted to prevent exploitations of 
lowwage workers predominantly immigrants the reagan 
administration for the past several years has attempted to eliminate 
the restrictions

miss barrymore who was a seasoned actress at age 6 when she 
played the impetuous gertie in the hit movie et the 
extraterrestrial was released just before christmas from an 
unidentified rehabilitation center in california where she was 
treated for alcohol abuse 
she said she started drinking at age 8 when she downed a glass

the daughter of a hungarianborn actress who is the third wife of

scientists engineers and physicians urged 
presidentelect bush on thursday to support their recommendations in 
the battle against aids to take steps to improve the global 
environment and to establish goals for the space program 
recommendations by the national academy of sciences and its 
affiliated national academy of engineering and national institute of 
medicine in the form of white papers commissioned by the presidents 
of the organizations included 
development of a comprehensive plan to finance care for those 
suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome and legislation 
to ban discrimination against them the contagious disease attacks 
the bodys immune system rendering it incapable of resisting other 
diseases and infections 
reduction in use of fossil fuels to slow the greenhouse 
effect warming of the planet they also advocated steppedup 
research into nonfossil energy sources such as a publicly 
acceptable nuclear reactor and urged increased energy efficiency 
throughout the economy 
swift selection of a chief for the national aeronautics and 
space administration coupled with making the space effort a 10 
billionayear base operation augmented by separately financed 
special efforts such as the space station which might add 3 
billion to 4 billion in peak years 
early naming of a science adviser to help select dozens of key 
scientific executives throughout the government sort out 
controversy among competiting weapons systems rebuild 
competitiveness of the nations technologies and reverse declining 
scientific and technical education 
in a cover letter to bush the presidents of the three 
organizations said that global environmental change must be made 
more prominent in the scientific political and foreign policy 
agendas of the united states 
the groups released white papers in the areas of the environment 
aids space and science policy by special study panels 
regarding space research the panel told bush the united states 
cannot take a leading position without his help 
to give visibility to the importance of his space program the 
president must establish his goals early in his administration he 
should then support them strongly with the public and the congress 
to help ensure their achievement the experts said 
on aids the panel urged the bush administration to protect those 
infected with the deadly virus from discrimination and ensure that 
screening tests for the disease be employed only when their 
purposes are clear and their results productive 
the aids study also said bush should continue aggressive 
educational programs and develop a plan for financing care of aids 
victims it urged the united states to be a leader in the 
international battle against aids and increase contributions to the 
global program to 50 million a year by 1990 from the current 15 
million 
the space panel said it believed a space station is essential 
to establish the feasibility of extended human space flight if the 
nation wants to pursue it but the concept of a space station will 
require revalidation to ensure that it fully supports the goals 
established by the president 
bush has said he favors the space station 
the space panel also urged a study of turning over to private 
operators more of nasas field activities such as the marshall space 
flight center at huntsville ala perhaps along the lines of the 
nasaowned jet propulsion laboratory operated by the california 
institute of technology 
the environment panel said natural gas should be favored over 
other fossil fuels in the short run because it releases less carbon 
dioxide than other fuels but we should explore means for reducing 
energy demand without impeding economic growth for example by 
using fossil fuels with greater efficiency 
carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere at about 03 
percent per year and accounts for about half the expected warming of 
two degrees fahrenheit to nine degrees the academy expects in the 
next century 
provisions of the treaty reducing emissions of chemicals that 
destroy the ozone layer should be accelerated and a complete ban on 
those chemicals sought the panel said these chlorofluorocarbon 
compounds also worsen the greenhouse effect the environmental 
protection agency already has called for such a ban

southwest airlines jet was caused by a gunman seeking revenge on a 
former supervisor 
psa flight 1771 crashed dec 7 l987 about l75 miles northwest 
of los angeles killing all 43 people aboard including a former 
usair employee who apparently had opened fire with a revolver during 
the flight 
the safety board said a note written by the man david burke 
threatened his former supervisor who also was aboard the flight 
the note was found in the wreckage as were the revolver and six 
spent cartridges 
the final twopage federal report on the accident included no 
information that had not previously been disclosed by investigators 
in general terms 
authorities within weeks of the accident said burke had taken a 
44caliber magnum revolver aboard the san franciscobound flight 
according to the psa investigation it is believed that burke was 
able to avoid detection of his revolver because he bypassed normal 
passenger security checks at the los angeles airport after being 
recognized as a former airline employee 
a cockpit recorder tape from the plane included gunshots in or 
near the cockpit according to the federal board the board said in 
a brief summary of findings released thursday that the tape revealed 
the sounds of a scuffle and several shots which were apparently 
fired in or near the cockpit 
it has been presumed that both the pilot and copilot were shot 
but the federal boards summary does not specifically say the two 
pilots had been hit by gunfire 
according to the findings the official probable cause for the 
accident was interference and intentional sabotage by an 
emotionally distraught passenger the safety board cited as 
contributing factors inadequate security and inadequate operatoring 
procedures by the airline that permitted burke to bypass security 
the crash prompted the federal aviation administration to order 
tighter security measures at passenger checkpoints especially in 
regard to airline and airport employees 
in an action that grew out of the psa crash the faa on wednesday 
announced a final regulation aimed at tightening access to 
restricted areas of an airport by using computerized identification 
badges such badges would make an id card ineffective if it is 
reported stolen or if a person leaves his job without returning the 
badge 
investigators have said that burke was believed to have still had 
his usair identification badge at the time he boarded flight 1771 
usair was a subsidiary of usair corp at the time of the crash and 
since has merged completely into usair 
the accident report said as has been disclosed previously that 
burke had left a goodbye message with friends and boarded psa 
flight 1771 with the intention of killing his former supervisor at 
usair

nearly 600 inmates were put on the 
streets today under pressure from a federal court to relieve prison 
overcrowding 
the inmates were the first to be released under a 1986 state law 
expanded in 1988 alowing wellbehaved prisoners to leave after 
serving half their sentences rather than twothirds some 300 more 
are to be freed later this month 
hilton butler warden of the louisiana state penitentiary at 
angola said inmates were taken to the gates if they had family 
waiting while vans took the rest to a bus terminal in baton rouge 
several of the 30 inmates awaiting buses at the terminal 
complained that the corrections department could have handled the 
release better 
robert dennis hage complained there was no organization in all 
of this you get 20 and they say theres the door ive already 
spent 5 here for a skimpy breakfast department records showed 
that hage was convicted of rape 
between the mid1970s and 1982 every state parish and city jail 
in louisiana came under federal court orders to relieve overcrowding 
the court set a maximum allowable population in the states nine 
prisons of 12330 inmates and also set ceilings in local jails 
of the inmates released today about half were from state 
prisons the rest were inmates being held in parish jails until room 
could be found for them in the state prisons which are at the 
population limit set by the court 
overcrowding has been blamed primarily on the enactment in recent 
years of mandatory sentences for various crimes lawmakers approved 
construction of two prisons but work has come almost to a 
standstill because of financial problems 
the legislature rejected most of former gov edwin edwards 
efforts to lessen penalties for various nonviolent crimes and 
create programs such as home imprisonment 
im not happy with our criminal justice system gov buddy 
roemer said wednesday adding that a task force will study the 
criminal justice system all the way from sentencing to 
rehabilitation to determine how to ease overcrowding 
although the inmates will be under parole supervision the 
releases will cause problems for the officers in charge of watching 
them officials said 
over the past three years the number of field parole agents has 
fallen from 365 to 252 said charles adams assistant director of 
parole services 
adams said statistics show that prisoners with early releases are 
more likely to run into trouble than regular probation and parole 
cases

the reagan administration has made no final 
decision about whether to attack a libyan plant it claims is 
producing chemical weapons but pentagon contingency plans suggest 
the firstever use of cruise missiles sources say 
such a strike would use a landattack variant of the navys 
tomahawk cruise missile equipped with a nonnuclear warhead that 
was first declared fit for use in war in march 1986 
use of the unmanned tomahawk is a preferred contingency 
because of the missiles accuracy and the fact that no pilots would 
be endangered in bombing runs the sources added 
the sources who insisted on anonymity agreed to discuss the 
libyan situation after two navy f14 tomcat jets shot down two 
libyan jet fighters wednesday in a confrontation over the 
mediterranean sea 
defense secretary frank c carlucci in discussing the conflict 
at a pentagon briefing flatly dismissed suggestions the f14s were 
airborne as part of us preparation for mounting an attack on the 
suspected chemical weapons plant libya says the plant makes 
pharmaceuticals not chemical weapons 
president reagan said last month his advisers were considering 
such a military strike 
the washington post reported in todays editions that reagan now 
opposes a us military strike against the plant because it would 
cause an international furor that might harm other us interests 
the post cited an unnamed senior administration official who said 
reagan was heeding the advice of european allies particularly 
british prime minister margaret thatcher that a military response 
would be unhelpful 
the british government said wednesday night meanwhile that it 
has confirmed beyond doubt that the plant in dispute was built to 
produce chemical weapons 
we have been in contact with a number of countries to make the 
point that we have independent information on the libyan chemical 
warfare programs said a british foreign ministry spokesman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity this information shows that the 
plant is very large and that there is no doubt it is intended for 
chemical warfare production 
meanwhile today state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
confirmed a los angeles times report that libya has attempted some 
backchannel contacts with the united states recently but she 
refused to define the substance of the messages or say how they were 
transmitted 
the times quoting unidentified officials said the overtures 
were rejected because they failed to address us complaints that 
gadhafis regime supports terrorism it said the most recent libyan 
contact came less than 24 hours before the fighters clashed over the 
mediterranean 
mrs oakley stressed that libya is well aware that belgium 
represents us interests in tripoli and should use that channel if 
it has any messages to send to the administration 
there have been several efforts by libya over the past year to 
send messages to the us government through various 
intermediaries she said the problem is not one of 
communication the problem is the policy and the conduct of the 
government of libya their policy particularly in support of 
terrorism 
carlucci said the f14s were on a routine training flight more 
than 600 miles from the libyan plant and 70 miles off libyas coast 
when they were approached in a hostile manner and fired in self 
defense 
what he didnt say was that if orders came to attack that 
plant we probably wouldnt use airplanes said one defense 
official we can use the tomahawk now 
the united states wants to prevent libyan strongman moammar 
gadhafi from starting largescale production of chemical weapons 
particularly given libyas past support of terrorist organizations 
the sources said 
the administration is now trying to isolate libya diplomatically 
and gain the cooperation of allies in denying libya access to 
western supplies and technology said to be needed for the plant 
secretary of state george p shultz plans to address the issue 
during an international conference on chemical weapons that opens 
saturday in paris 
there wont be any military action before then said one 
official 
but the contingency planning no longer focuses on bombing 
runs said another source the tomahawk is missioncapable and 
we have the digitized navigation data for the missile needed to 
fly a strike 
the new plant is situated about 35 miles inland from the coastal 
capital of tripoli the conventional landattack model of the 
tomahawk has a range of 700plus miles meaning cruise missiles 
could easily be launched by either submarine or surface ship against 
the libyan facility 
when the united states staged a bombing raid over two libyan 
cities in 1986 it did not have enough conventional tomahawks 
available to mount the attack one air force f111 bomber and two 
aviators were lost in those bombing runs which were in retaliation 
for alleged libyan involvement in the bombing of a west berlin 
discotheque frequented by american servicemen 
the tomahawk is a flying torpedo with short stubby wings and a 
small tail fin powered by a jet engine it can fly at extremely low 
altitude just below the speed of sound and is almost impervious to 
air defenses on the ground 
the missile finds its way with an advanced navigation system and 
sensors that allow it to follow a preprogrammed computerized map in 
its memory 
he conventional variant of the tomahawk costs roughly 15 
million and has never been fired in a conflict the navy to date has 
certified 35 of its submarines and 23 surface ships to deploy with 
the tomahawk eventually 100 submarines and 91 surface ships are to 
carry the weapon 
according to one pentagon source the accuracy is such that we 
can put a tomahawk through the goal posts on a football field after 
a flight of 500 to 700 miles

the state exercising its powers under a 
1984 academic bankruptcy law for the first time plans to seize 
control of two troubled school districts a newspaper reported today 
superintendent of public instruction john brock will recommend 
taking control of the floyd and whitley districts to the state 
school board next week the lexington heraldleader said citing 
unidentified sources 
brock refused to comment on the report 
the school districts in rural eastern kentucky have been the 
focus of state investigations and parents complaints both are 
receiving state help with management and academic problems 
floyd county superintendent ron hager said brock telephoned him 
to say the action was based on low attendance and test scores the 
school system is expecting to complete the fiscal year with a 
deficit of more than 300000 
floyd and whitley have a combined enrollment of about 12900 
students 
a month ago brock issued a study of floyd countys 22 schools 
that turned up reports of rampant patronage and nepotism wide 
disparities in what is taught from school to school and other 
academic shortcomings 
a 1987 consultants report on the whitley district said it lacked 
sound purchasing procedures had attendance problems spent too much 
time embroiled in politics and legal action and lacked highquality

independent counsel lawrence walsh citing 
difficult classified information problems moved today to 
dismiss the two central charges against fired national security 
council aide oliver l north in the irancontra case 
walsh said he sought to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges 
because of norths insistence on disclosing large amounts of secret 
information and the reagan administrations refusal to declassify 
many documents 
in resisting norths disclosure request intelligence officials 
have cited concerns over national security 
efforts to simplify the charges have not eliminated the risk 
that a quantity of classified national security information would be 
compromised by a public trial on the conspiracy and theft charges 
walsh said in the brief motion 
trial is scheduled to begin jan 31 
if us district judge gerhard gesell approves walshs motion 
there still would be a dozen criminal charges remaining against 
north including allegations that he obstructed inquiries and made 
false statements in the irancontra affair 
walshs move came a day after he met with attorney general dick 
thornburgh to discuss the continuing problems posed by classified 
documents both sides want to use in the case 
it was at that meeting that walsh told the attorney general he 
planned to seek dismissal of the two charges the justice department 
said in a statement 
the department of justice believes that the motion is a 
constructive step in the handling of very sensitive national 
security issues the statement said 
the white house facing a new round of lobbying for a 
presidential pardon for north had no immediate comment 
walsh cited the judges refusal to allow further censorship of 
300 prosecution exhibits as another reason for seeking dismissal of 
the two main charges the independent counsel had sought a 
modification of guidelines gesell laid down last month to accomodate 
continuing objections of the cia and other intelligence agencies 
under the classified information procedures act the attorney 
general can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to prevent 
disclosure of secrets that might endanger national security 
the conspiracy and theft of government property charges were the 
main counts against north for selling missiles to iran and diverting 
some of the profits from those sales to the nicaraguan contras 
in the initial indictment former national security adviser john 
m poindexter and middlemen richard v secord and albert hakim were 
named in these two counts their trials were severed from norths 
and have not been scheduled yet and todays motion will likely 
result in dismissal of the same charges against poindexter hakim 
and secord 
in his motion to dismiss the two central counts walsh said that 
because of several factors including the position of the nations 
intelligence agencies on maintaining the classified status of 
certain information the conspiracy and theft counts cannot be 
tried in a manner that protects that information 
walsh said there were other factors leading him to seek 
abandonment of the two charges 
one was norths continued insistence on introducing classified 
information in his defense another was gesells dec 12 order 
directing that classified information not be purged from the 
documents that walsh planned to introduce as part of the prosecution 
walsh also cited gesells refusal on tuesday to reconsider part 
of that order 
walsh said he hoped the dismissal will enable the trial to 
commence on jan 31 1989 
walsh said that by far the most difficult classified 
information problems stem from the conspiracy and theft of 
government property charges they allege norths interaction with 
a number of intelligence agencies and touch upon a number of highly 
classified covert programs 
the remaining charges include obstruction of congress in 1985 and 
1986 concealing and destroying documents in connection with a 1986 
inquiry into the affair by thenattorney general edwin meese 
north also is charged with converting travelers checks to his 
own use and accepting a free security system installed at his home 
meanwhile the us court of appeals on wednesday dissolved a 
temporary stay it issued the day before and denied a motion to bar 
gesell permanently from giving walshs office a classified summary 
of proposed defense testimony 
the request could have forced a delay in the trial 
norths lawyers have said providing the 162page summary to 
prosecutors would give them an unfair early idea of norths defense 
but a threejudge appeals court panel said its intervention was 
warranted only in extraordinary situations 
this court will not interrupt a criminal proceeding and invade 
the province of the district court when petitioner has an effective 
remedy through direct appeal from a final judgment of conviction 
the judges said in a twopage order 
at the white house deputy press secretary b jay cooper said he 
would have no immediate comment on walshs motion reagan was 
returning from a california vacation later in the day 
reagan has repeatedly said that he is not considering a pardon 
for north and that he believes the legal process should go forward 
but the president has come under increasing lobbying pressure to 
grant a pardon and the conservative future political action 
committee ran a fullpage advertisement in thursdays editions of 
the washington times urging a pardon 
mr president the time has come to end the personal suffering 
and torment of your special hero col oliver north who has endured 
vicious media attack for over two years it said 
cooper said some 300 pronorth calls had been received at the 
white house switchboard by midday

many explosives cannot be detected by 
conventional technology and only intensive questioning of passengers 
can prevent bombings of commerical airliners israeli terrorism 
experts said thursday 
the experts displayed a replica of an explosiveladen suitcase 
believed similar to one suspected in the bombing of pan am flight 
103 on dec 21 over lockerbie scotland 
they said the hardsided bag could hold two to 44 pounds of 
plastic explosive concealed in a false bottom 
this kind of device is very hard to detect by relying on the 
traditional kind of xraying used in europe and the united states 
it is almost impossible said menachem bacharach of international 
consultants on targeted security an israeli company specializing in 
aviation security 
it is better to concentrate on the passenger and whether he 
exhibits suspicious behavior during questioning bacharach said 
the suitcase and a replica of a radiocassette tape player fitted 
with about one pound of explosives seized from palestinian 
guerrillas in frankfurt in october are among the devices to be 
displayed at an international seminar on aviation security to be 
held feb 59 in tel aviv 
civil aviation authorities and security heads of airports and 
airlines from 25 countries will attend the conference aimed at 
improving air security worldwide 
the replica of the radio displayed thursday contained coils of 
brown clay instead of plastic explosives 
bacharach said his company planted the dummy radio on a woman 
employee to try to test security in six european airports in 
november and early december 
he said the radio was discovered by security officials in five of 
the airports after the woman was subjected to intensive questioning 
in one airport the officials identified the woman as suspicious but 
did not find the radio hidden in her hand luggage 
in each case the xray monitor failed to detect the radio 
only when the security officials emptied the suitcase and went 
through it item by item did they discover something was wrong 
bacharach said 
he said the task of detecting hidden explosives was made more 
difficult by the fact that electrical appliances containing the 
devices often operate normally 
many devices also are detonated by timers that cannot be detected 
by immersion in decompression chambers frequently used by airlines 
to test for explosives bacharach said

president francois mitterrand said thursday that 
france plans to elevate the status of the palestine liberation 
organizations office in paris to a general delegation 
the president speaking to reporters at the elysee palace said 
france recognized only states possessing a territory and thus was 
unable to accord the plo representation diplomatic status and 
privileges but he said paris had to take into account the recent 
decisions of the plo in algiers 
mitterrand did not indicate when the change would be made 
there are two general delegations in paris representing 
north korea and quebec the plo currently operates an office of 
liaison and information directed by ibrahim souss 
a french foreign ministry official said a general delegation 
was a title that did not carry the same status and privileges as a 
diplomatic mission the official was unable to specify exactly what 
the change would mean but said the move clearly was a significant 
and symbolic gesture toward the plo 
on nov 15 the palestine national council the plos parliament 
in exile declared an independent palestine without specifying its 
borders accepted unequivocally un resolution 242 implicitly 
recognizing israel and renounced terrorism 
even more explicit statements on recognition of israel and 
denunciation of terrorism were pronounced by plo chairman yasser 
arafat in geneva last month prompting the united states to make its 
first official contact with the guerrilla organization 
dozens of countries have recognized the state of palestine as 
represented by the plo 
mitterrand said the declarations by the plo at algiers 
unquestionably advanced things 
if there is no palestinian country today there is a 
renaissance of the palestinian nation the president said 
asked about an eventual meeting with arafat mitterrand said i 
certainly would not refuse under conditions that i would define

the communist party on thursday urged mass 
rehabiliation of victims of the feared troikas the summary 
courts that carried out josef stalins bloody purges 
the partys policymaking central committee saying progress 
depends on rectifying the past recommended that top government 
bodies pass a law to consider rehabilitated all citizens repressed 
by decisions of these organs 
such a recommendation from a top party body is certain to be 
approved by the government 
it was not clear how many cases among the millions of people 
killed imprisoned or exiled by stalin would be affected by the 
action which was announced on the evening tv news program 
vremya and carried by the tass news agency 
but it was apparent the party believes consideration of stalins 
repression is keeping the country from focusing on its future and 
that it was seeking quick resolution of as many cases as possible 
the troikas were so named because they consisted of three 
local officials the head of the secret police the communist party 
leader and prosecutor western historians say they had the power to 
inflict death penalities often without any reference to the soviet 
penal code 
the central committee said their decisions must be overturned 
because the troikas had no legal standing 
it said the work of special boards formed under a corrective 
labor law that usually consisting of secret police police and 
government officials who often passed hundreds of sentences a day 
also must be undone by the same government directive 
restoration of historical legal justice now has taken on a 
huge political meaning the central committee statement said 
much of our movement on the road to forming a government of 
socialist law social consciousness depends on it 
society relatives and those close to the victims are awaiting 
full rehabiliation of all the innocent and perpetuation of their 
memory it said 
under president mikhail s gorbachev soviet society has reopened 
the wounds of stalins purges and the dictator himself is regularly 
and bitterly criticized both in private and public gorbachev has 
endorsed an initiative to build a monument to the victims of stalin 
western references say the cheka the forerunner of todays kgb 
set up troika courts as early as april 1918 less than a year 
after the bolshevik revolution and during the time of soviet founder 
vladimir i lenin but the central committee directive specifically 
limited the scope of the rehabiliation to the period of stalins 
absolute power from 1930 until his death in 1953 
the central committee statement said it is essential to speed up 
the work of legally rectifying the standing of those who were 
killed imprisoned or exiled by stalin 
thousands of stalins victims were given back their good names 
after nikita s khrushchev denounced the dictator in a secret speech 
to the party in 1956 three years after stalin died 
the work stalled under leonid i brezhnev but picked up again 
under gorbachev in february prominent bolshevik leader nikolai i 
bukharin who was convicted in a 1937 show trial and executed was 
cleared by the soviet supreme court of any wrongdoing 
the court in 1988 also cleared many other prominent leaders 
purged by stalin but the cases of thousands of littleknown people 
remain untouched 
politburo member mikhail solomentsev told the communist party 
newspaper pravda in august that a special politburo commission he 
headed had cleared the names of 636 people solomentsev was 
dismissed by gorbachev at the end of september 
the directive said the mass rehabilitation should not apply to 
war criminals or those who committed treason during world war ii

a federal appeals court ruling in a 
trademarkinfringement case today spared toyota motor corp from an 
embarrassing scramble to mask the nameplates on its lexus luxury 
cars premiering at a major auto show 
but the court said the japanese automaker cannot advertise the 
brand nationally until the trademark dispute is settled 
the ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york

show here

kearse extends the stay at least until jan 30 when the court will 
hear arguments in the case 
kearse ruled that toyota may continue to use the lexus name at 
the auto show and at other expositions but cannot advertise the name 
nationally in the meantime 
before the ruling toyota officials had nervously wondered 
whether they would have to cover up the names of the cars at their 
swank display booth 
essentially they have given each side part of what it 
wanted said charles j farouki a mead attorney 
arthur d gray a toyota attorney said were pleased with the 
result 
reporters got a preview of the auto show in detroits cobo hall 
the opens to the public saturday and runs through jan 15 
our most immediate job is to earn name recognition for lexus

the us air force is considering 
moving some jet fighter training missions to morocco as a way to 
ease the burden over densely populated west germany the air forces 
european chief said thursday 
gen william l kirk in an interview with the associated press 
also staunchly defended the need to keep up lowlevel training 
missions to have a mission ready force in central europe 
the training missions have caused controversy in west germany 
because of military jet crashes in the country 
the air force announced kirk will retire in april the 
56yearold louisiana native will be replaced by lt gen michael j 
dugan now based in washington 
were looking at the possibility of moving some training 
missions to morocco kirk said in his office at the us air base 
in ramstein the base was the site of a fiery crash of an italian 
air force stunt team that killed 70 people at an air show in august 
kirk the air forces commander in chief in europe said talks 
between us and moroccan officials are at a very preliminary 
stage 
we have on previous occasions deployed us aircraft to morocco 
for joint training with the moroccan air force he said 
morocco an arab nation in northern africa is known for its 
generally moderate prowestern stance kirk would not give any 
other information about the possibility of moving training missions 
there 
the general said an export of lowflying fighter training to 
other countries was one way to ease the burden on west germany but 
he acknowledged that finding countries willing to accept more 
training missions would be difficult 
on tuesday nato pilots resumed tactical flights over west 
germany after a threeweek moratorium sparked by the dec 8 crash of 
a us military jet in the northern city of remscheid the crash 
killed five west germans and the us pilot 
lowlevel flights are defined as those involving dives below 250 
feet but in the public debate the term has been blurred to the 
extent that it sometimes includes flights below 10000 feet 
the us air force reduced lowflying missions by about 40 
percent from 1981 to 1987 and has reached the point beyond which 
we cant reduce any further and still maintain missionready 
status kirk said 
he added i can understand the burden on the people 
however kirk said the recent flying moratorium had seriously 
hurt the five fighter wings comprising 350 jets in west germany 
you cant just not fly for three to four weeks and then all of 
a sudden turn it back on kirk said we are at a point where the 
civilian leadership within the nato alliance needs to say one way or 
the other whether or not were going to maintain missionready 
status in the federal republic west germany

the national pork producers council said 
thursday it has formally asked the us government to impose import 
duties on pork products from canada claiming that the canadian meat 
is subsidized and competes unfairly with american hog farmers 
council president ray hankes said a petition was filed jan 4 
with the us international trade commission and the commerce 
department asking that countervailing duties be imposed on fresh 
chilled and frozen pork products from canada 
state pork associations and a number of us meat packing 
companies also signed the petition a ruling on the councils 
petition is expected in about six months he said 
a countervailing duty would eliminate the unfair advantage 
canadian farmers have over us pork producers because the canadian 
government subsidizes its hog production hankes said in a 
statement released here canadian pork producers can benefit from 
more than 20 potential subsidy programs 
there has been an import duty on live hogs from canada since july 
1985 a move that was upheld by the us court of international 
trade during a lengthy appeals process 
but the american producers contend that the import duty on live 
hogs doesnt prevent canada from slaughtering its hogs and shipping 
the pork to us markets the commerce department ruled in 1985 that 
the import duties on pork products were justified 
the us court of international trade acting on an appeal by the 
canadian meat council overruled the commerce decision 
as a result canada has increased its shipments of pork into the 
united states by more than 52 percent since 1984 hankes said 
the council also said that imports of canadian pork have reduced 
the revenues of us hog producers by as much as 337 per 100 
pounds of hogs marketed in the first nine months of 1988 according 
to a study by economist glenn grimes of the university of missouri

one of the nations oldest astronomical 
treasures the mothballed 100inch telescope at the mount wilson 
observatory in california will be recommissioned under a new 
ownership plan for the facility the carnegie institution announced 
thursday 
the institution which built the observatory in 1904 and has 
operated it since retired the big hooker telescope in 1985 as it 
shifted its priorities to development of more powerful instruments 
at its new observatory in las campanas chile 
for three decades the hooker telescope completed in 1917 was 
the worlds largest and the prototype for all modernday reflecting 
telescopes its 100inch mirror weighing 4 tons was cast by a 
french bottlemaking company 
despite mothballing the hooker the carnegie institution has 
continued to operate three other research telescopes at mount 
wilson under the plan announced thursday the entire observatory 
will be transferred to the new mount wilson institution headed by 
carnegie veterans over the next two years and will be independently 
financed largely from government grants 
the arrangement was worked out primarily by george preston 
former observatory director and now a chief scientist there preston 
called the plan a rebirth for the observatory and one that will 
make the best use of the facilities 
not only will the hooker telescope be recommissioned within a 
year he said but it will be fitted with hightech computer 
controls and instruments over two to three years he said also that 
overall research at the observatory will be expanded under plans to 
double the operating budget to 750000 and to add several more 
scientists to the five teams already at work there 
during the 1920s carnegie astronomers edwin hubble and milton 
humason using the hooker telescope established that the spiral 
nebulae in the night sky were other galaxies made up of billions 
of stars and located far outside the milky way the galaxy that 
contains the earth thus the size of the universe then known by 
astronomers expanded almost a thousandfold overnight 
but growing light pollution from nearby los angeles has in recent 
years virtually destroyed hookers biggest claim to fame that 
ability to study faint distant galaxies and was a major factor in 
carnegies decision to focus its efforts in chile 
however preston and arthur vaughn said the hooker telescope at 
5700 feet altitude remains an ideal tool for studying the sun and 
for detecting planets around stars in the milky way it also will be 
used to study starspots similar to the sunspot activity once 
thought to be unique to the sun

a senate chairman on thursday asked 
presidentelect bush to direct the fbi to investigate a newspapers 
allegations that a bush cabinet nominee served in a gop unit 
riddled with former nazi collaborators 
a california paper the oakland tribune raised questions in an 
editorial dec 28 about edward derwinski bushs choice to be the 
first head of the newly created department of veterans affairs 
through a spokesman derwinski said the charges amounted to 
guilt by association 
the editorial said that in 1972 derwinski a former republican 
congressman from cook county ill headed the executive board of 
the heritage groups for reelection of the president active in 
richard nixons reelection campaign and this year cochaired 
bushs coalition of american nationalities 
several members of the coalition resigned last summer after the 
washington jewish week said they had profasict or antisemitic 
records during world war ii 
sen alan cranston dcalif who will preside over the senate 
veterans affairs committees confirmation hearings on derwinskis 
nomination asked bush in a letter to direct the fbi to look into 
the editorials charges in the course of its customary background 
investigation 
cranston asked to see the fbis findings before the senate 
hearings are conducted this month or in february 
derwinski has served in the state department since 1983 he 
became undersecretary of state for security assistance science and 
technology last year 
derwinski was not available for comment but a spokesman bill 
anderson said of the editorial it is guilt by association he 
has had nothing to do with the hiring or the service of those 
mentioned in this article anyone who examines his record in 
support for example of jewish organizations or as a diplomat in 
israel can categorically rule out any antisemitism on his part 
anderson said derwinski had lent his name to republican ethnic 
committees in every presidential election campaign since 1960 
cranston in his letter said he had talked about the editorial 
with derwinski on wednesday during a nice meeting with him to 
discuss the forthcoming nomination 
he sent bush a copy of the editorial and wrote as you can see 
the editorial raises serious charges about his derwinskis record 
of service in an organization riddled with former nazi 
collaborators and his alleged role in passing us secrets to the 
south korean cia in the late 1970s 
the editorial said those questions should be answered before 
derwinski is approved by the senate 
those questions are apt given derwinskis record of service in 
an organization riddled with former nazi collaborators and his 
alleged role in passing us secrets to the south korean cia in the 
late 1970s the editorial said 
the record certainly doesnt prove that derwinski is a closet 
nazi sympathizer or a foe of democracy the editorial said but 
it does call into profound question his judgment in particular his 
willingness to turn a blind eye to the background and beliefs of 
notorious colleagues if they share his anticommunism 
the paper quoted russ bellant author of a study published by 
political research associates in cambridge mass as saying that 
at least four people charged with war crimes were in leadership 
positions of the 1972 republican group derwinski headed 
the editorial also said that during a 1977 house investigation of 
alleged south korean influence peddling on capitol hill derwinski 
appeared to be responsible for leaking to the korean government the 
defection of an official of the korean central intelligence agency 
but anderson said the house ethics committee investigated and 
cleared derwinski of tipping off the south korean government 
its a nonevent anderson said

yugoslavias outgoing government has 
ordered the cancellation of sharp price increases of electricity and 
rail transport newspapers reported thursday 
a wave of steep price increases on other essential services and 
foodstuffs hit yugoslavs when shops opened after the new years 
holiday 
yugoslavias government resigned dec 30 following its failure to 
curb a 250 percent annual inflation rate and solve the countrys 
other economic and social problems it was the first federal cabinet 
to step down since the communists took power after world war ii 
branko mikulic will stay in office as a caretaker premier until 
the ninemember federal presidency names a new premier expected by 
the end of january mikulic then will appoint his new cabinet by the 
end of february the state tanjug news agency said thursday 
early speculation in the staterun press on who will become 
yugoslavias new premier centered on ante markovic former head of 
the croatian government and a supporter of radical marketoriented 
reforms and oskar kovac a prominent belgrade economist and former 
cabinet minister who resigned over disagreements with mikulic 
also mentioned was slobodan milosevic serbias ambitious 
hardline communist party chief but it is considered highly unlikely 
that he would get support from yugoslavias other five republics and 
two provinces 
the outgoing government has canceled a 70 percent price increase 
of electricity originally due to take effect on thursday after 
widespread protests by consumers all over the country 
yugoslavias staterun railroad companies however defied the 
governments order to freeze their prices temporarily charging 347 
percent higher rates for passengers and 516 percent more for cargo 
as of jan 1 
as soon as they heard that the government had fallen the 
railroad companies decided to ignore the order to cancel the price 
hikes the vecernje novosti newspaper said 
the price increases would boost the countrys rampant inflation 
and lead to further drop in living standards which have already 
fallen to the level of the mid1960s according to official 
statistics 
the last time the prices of electricity and rail transport were 
considerably increased was in october 
the new price increases ranged form 30 percent to 500 percent on 
food drinks cars newspapers and nearly all services 
nearly 1400 strikes took place last year amid public calls for 
the introduction of a multiparty system as a solution to the 
protracted yugoslav crisis

in what may be the ultimate nowin

preserve said thursday we have to manage for the best overall 
conservation and sometimes that favors plants over animals 
but the framingham humane society contends there ought to be a 
little more muskrat love at the 45acre garden in the woods 
preserve it says that trapping muskrats merely encourages the 
remaining ones to reproduce faster providing little more than a 
quick fix to the delicate problem of balance between flora and fauna 
the society also maintains the underwater conibear traps which 
break the muskrats necks pose a danger to humans and pets it is 
lobbying for a ban on the use of those and all steeljaw leghold 
traps in framingham a suburb of 45000 people about 20 miles west 
of boston 
these are dangerous things they dont belong in a civilized 
urban environment said society member mary anne wyatt 
garden in the woods was founded in 1931 and has been owned by the 
3400member new england wildflower society since 1965 an island of 
calm in the middle of framingham it contains 1400 plant species in 
a natural setting interwoven with three miles of footpaths 
longland 37 said garden in the woods has been trapping muskrats 
for at least five years catching an average of one a year in its 
lily pond he said the preserve uses the springloaded underwater 
conibear traps because they snap the animals necks killing them 
instantly 
the traps kill very humanely we made sure of that he said 
ms wyatt argued that the traps work correctly only if the prey 
is the right size 
theyre totally nonspecific they will catch anything that 
comes to the water line she said dogs cats waterfowl 
children 
longland said garden in the woods decided to trap the muskrats 
because they are voracious eaters of aquatic vegetation left 
unchecked he said the furry webfooted rodents threatened to wipe 
out some of the colorful and unusual species like albino pickerel 
weed blue iris hookeri and pink pygmy water lilies that attract 
20000 visitors to the preserve each year 
carol a marchione president of the humane society said garden 
in the woods should switch to using box traps which capture 
muskrats alive for relocating 
but longland said the preserve has already tried that as well 
as chemical repellants lining the banks of the lily pond with 
stones and covering rare plants with wire mesh 
the muskrats spurned the box traps even though the bait was a 
tantalizing combination of apples scented with water lily extract 
rain washed away the repellant forcing repeated applications when 
the banks of the pond were packed with stones the resourceful 
creatures merely dug in from higher ground and when the plants were 
covered with mesh the muskrats found a way to get through it 
nothing worked longland said weve found that muskrats 
will do whatever they have to do to eat 
marchione said she believes that garden in the woods simply 
misunderstands the problem with traps and has requested a meeting 
next week to try to reach a solution 
were both conservationisttype societies and we should be 
able to work something out she said

a 22foot 5400pound whale that was near 
death after beaching itself on a sand bar six weeks ago was returned 
thursday to its natural habitat far out in the gulf of mexico 
researchers say it is the first whale in the baleen family known 
to have recovered and returned to the ocean 
the 2yearold brydes whale nicknamed brydie by its 
rescuers was trucked to st petersburg from orlando on wednesday in 
a special waterfilled container from there the whale and its 
handlers sailed 120 miles southwest of tampa beyond the continental 
shelf aboard a coast guard cutter 
the animal was hoisted overboard into the water with a crane 
thursday morning sea world spokesman nick gollattscheck said 
brydie was outfitted with a radio transmitter attached to her 
dorsal fin so scientists can track her progress for about two months 
when the transmitter is expected to slough off 
radio signals began almost immediately after brydie was placed in 
the water and swam away said jack pearson sea worlds curator of 
marine mammals pearson speaking by radio from the release vessel 
said the whale was doing fine 
the whale was emaciated and dehydrated and had bacterial 
infections when she was discovered nov 25 near honeymoon island off 
clearwater 
she was brought to orlando and treated with antibiotics and a 
rich highcalorie diet of smelt krill and other fish 
brydie was released because we had reached a plateau in its 
treatment said another sea world spokesman brad andrews you 
stabilize the animal medically and feed it so many calories 
artificially that you reach a point where you determine youve done 
all you can its up to the animal then to start feeding itself a 
more natural diet and get back to its natural habitat 
baleen whales one of two major groups of the mammals include 
the brydes humpback pygmy right gray and blue whales 
most of the whales that beach themselves die despite medical 
treatment they are usually fatally ill or diseased suffer severe 
trauma and other problems but a small percentage can survive with 
proper treatment sea world scientists say

american linguist noam chomsky has 
accused the defense minister of being an apologist for serious 
crimes during a monthslong battle in a dutch newspaper over human 
rights abuses by dictatorships 
in a feud that began in october defense minister frits 
bolkestein and the academician have traded verbal barbs via lengthy 
contributions to the nrc handelsblad the netherlands newspaper of 
record 
in his most recent rejoinder published in wednesdays edition 
bolkestein wrote that chomsky an outspoken critic of the us 
political establishment has placed himself outside reality by 
airing his extreme views 
contacted by telephone in cambridge mass where he teaches 
linguistics at the massachusetts institute of technology chomsky 
told the associated press thursday that bolkestein has been 
telling outrageous lies 
apparently he doesnt believe in free speech said the 
outspoken chomsky who referred to bolkestein as a fascist 
the controversy began when in october when the newspaper printed 
a pagelong review by bolkestein of two recent chomsky books the 
culture of terrorism and the chomsky reader 
bolkestein was a prominent legislator for the rightwing liberal 
party before being named to his current post in august and his 
review was accecpted before his cabinet nomination according to 
paulus smit the newspaper editor handling the chomskybolkestein 
exchange 
in his review headlined a linguists grim version of 
reality bolkestein accused chomsky of trivializing the mass 
murders by the cambodian khmer rouge in the 1970s 
for chomsky the genocide in cambodia was a deliberate lie 
spread by the mass media to cover up the real mass murders in 
central america perpetrated or supported by successive us 
governments bolkestein wrote 
he also criticized chomskys defense of robert faurisson a 
french historian who has denied the existence of nazi extermination 
camps 
faurisson a professor of literature caused public outrage in 
france 11 years ago by claiming that no jews had ever been killed in 
nazi death camp gas chambers the claim published in french 
newspapers led to faurissons suspension from the university of 
lyon 
in his october article bolkestein noted that chomsky was one of 
500 intellectuals who signed a petition defending faurissons 
freedom of speech and that the american linguist wrote a preface in 
a faurisson book in which chomsky said he had found no traces of 
antisemitism in the french professors work 
to call faurisson an apolitical kind of liberal is naive or 
worse bolkestein wrote 
in an extensive rejoinder published by nrc handelsblad on dec 
29 chomsky accused the defense minister of trivializing cruelties 
perpetrated by governments dependent of the united states and as a 
result he is an apologist for serious crimes 
that was an apparent reference to bolkesteins remark that human 
rights abuses were not only committed by rightwing death squads in 
central america but also by sandinista government troops in 
nicaragua 
on the faurisson issue chomsky said that i have taken even 
more extreme stands in the struggle to defend human liberties in 
the 1960s i have urged that american war criminals be allowed to 
teach and do research even if their work would lead to death and 
destruction 
faurisson was not even accused of war crimes chomsky wrote

the education community on thursday challenged 
presidentelect bush to back up his promise to be the education 
president by spending 10 billion more including a down payment of 
25 billion 
during the 1980s education declined as a proportion and hence 
as a priority in the federal budget said gerald morris president 
of a 100group coalition called the committee for education funding 
a fouryear 10 billion effort is needed to make education a 
priority 
the committee said bush should start by proposing 25 billion in 
extra federal education spending for fiscal 1990 
in the committee blueprint most of the money 16 billion 
would go to programs for disadvantaged students of all ages from 
remedial tutoring to college tuition grants another 768 million 
would cover the cost of inflation for all federal education 
programs while 150 million would be reserved for presidential 
initiatives and modest increases in small existing programs 
in addition the committee said bush should earmark an extra 500 
million for head start the preschool program for disadvantaged 
children that is administered by the department of health and human 
services 
the committee plan comes amid congressional complaints over the 
federal deficit and reports president reagan will propose 35 
billion in cuts in the budget he sends to congress on monday 
the current education department budget is 219 billion 16 
billion higher than fiscal 1988 the 25 billion increase sought by 
the committee to 244 billion would be an 11 percent boost 
we dont see that its unrealistic or unattainable said 
becky timmons vice president of the committee 
morris said reaction on capitol hill has been mixed the coins 
still up in the air he said well see how it lands when it 
falls 
morris declined to comment on bushs vow not to raise taxes or to 
suggest where bush should cut spending to finance the education 
hikes but he and others stressed they are encouraged by bushs 
campaign promises his tone of moderation and his appointments 
so far 
we havent had the luxury of working with the administration in 
the last seven years because weve been on opposite sides of the 
fence morris said with bush we may have a very different and 
warmer and certainly welcome environment 
bushs priorities will become clear as he and his aides rework 
reagans lameduck document and education department officials have 
indicated changes will be made whether they will be substantial 
enough to satisfy the education community is an open question 
theres an education deficit analogous to the grand canyon 
morris said to have someone throw in a shovel of dirt is not 
going to solve the problem 
according to the committee education spending accounted for 25 
percent of the federal budget in fiscal 1979 but only 17 percent in 
fiscal 1988 in the same time period pell grants to needy college 
students went from covering 50 percent of all college expenses to 29 
percent while the buying power of the maximum award declined 13 
percent 
citing other aspects of what the education deficit officials 
said head start serves less than 20 percent of the children who 
qualify for it chapter 1 the major federal program for 
disadvantaged elementary and secondary school children serves less 
than half those eligible 
in addition they said federal money for educating handicapped 
children now covers only 8 percent of perpupil expenditures as 
opposed to 125 percent in 1979 
the committee is a nonprofit nonpartisan coalition of groups 
that represent more than 50 million students parents teachers 
administrators presidents librarians counselors trustees and 
school board members virtually every major education group in the 
country is a member

the united states got support thursday from an ally and an 
adversary for its claim that libya is capable of producing chemical 
weapons 
the united states has alleged that libya has a chemical weapons 
plant at rabta south of the capital tripoli libya claims the 
plant is for manufacturing pharmaceuticals 
british foreign secretary geoffrey howe visiting abu dhabi lent 
support to the us claim when he told a news conference we do 
have independent information on libyas chemical weapons program 
showing their plant as a very large one and it is no doubt intended 
for chemical weapons production 
in washington the state department welcomed britains 
announcement 
we certainly feel gratified that the british have talked about 
evidence that supports the allegations that we have made on this 
question spokeswoman phyllis oakley told reporters she declined 
to say whether british officials had shared their information with 
the us government 
in moscow a soviet general gave his countrys first 
acknowledgement that libya may be able to manufacture chemical 
weapons but he said such weapons would be in quantities too small 
to wage war 
as recently as wednesday night staterun radio moscow was 
rejecting as groundless us charges that libya had developed a 
chemical weapons plant 
lt gen anatoly kuntsevich deputy chief of soviet chemical 
weapons troops told reporters in moscow that libya doesnt have 
the industrial capacity to make toxic agents in sufficient 
quantities to conduct warfare but as far as a few kilograms 
pounds of toxic agents goes any serious chemical laboratory in 
the world can make several kilos say one to five kilos five to 11 
pounds of toxic agents 
kuntsevich spoke at a news briefing the soviet government news 
agency novosti had called to discuss a fiveday international 
conference on chemical weapons that begins saturday in paris 
secretary of state george shultz plans to use the meeting to 
persuade more that 100 nations to impose sanctions on countries that 
use poison gas 
president reagan has refused to rule out military action against 
the plant and howe indicated britain might not support such action 
asked if britain would support a us attack the foreign 
secretary declined to give a direct reply but noted it must be 
emphasized that chemical weapons capability is quite different from 
the circumstances which we thought justified the action taken some 
time ago 
he was referring to the april 1986 us air raids on tripoli and 
benghazi following charges of libyan involvement in the bombing of a 
west berlin disco some of the us bombers flew from bases in 
britain 
howe justified the downing of the two libyan mig23 fighters by 
us navy jets wednesday as selfdefense and said the incident had 
nothing to do with the libyan plant 
weve been given an account by the united states on what has 
happened from which it is clear that they acted in selfdefense 
he said 
the soviet union denounced the action involving the libyan 
fighters foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov was quoted 
by tass as calling the act a show of political adventurism and 
state terrorism 
in rome italian government leaders appealed for restraint by 
both sides 
in a statement issued at the united nations the 101nation 
nonaligned movement condemned the us act as unprovoked aggression 
and state terrorism and called on the united states to withdraw 
its naval forces libya is a member of the movement 
kuwait and north yemen condemned the us action and persian 
gulf newspapers called for action against the united states for 
enforcing the law of the jungle 
iraq syria and iran denounced the action in statements 
wednesday but moderate arab governments which have long kept their 
distance from libyas leader col moammar gadhafi avoided outright 
attacks on the united states 
saudi arabia a key us ally in the arab world only voiced 
deep concern at the us action and urged selfcontrol and 
wisdom to prevent a further crisis

former philippine president ferdinand marcos was 
released from a hospital before dawn thursday after a weeks stay 
for treatment of congestive heart failure 
marcos 71 left by ambulance accompanied by his wife imelda 
and several physicians said st francis medical center spokeswoman 
norma kop 
in previous hospital stays newspapers television and radio 
stations were given notice of marcos arrivals and departures from 
the hospital 
apparently stung by criticism that he sought media attention to 
help his legal cause marcos was whisked from the hospital with no 
fanfare thursday a marcos employee contacted three hours after the 
release claimed marcos was still in the hospital 
however marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad later confirmed that the 
former president was resting at his makiki heights home trinidad 
said he did not know why the move was made in secret 
kop said marcos doctors would issue no statement hes gone 
thats all i can say and i dont think there will be any updates 
kop said 
marcos spent a week at st francis after suffering his second 
severe case of congestive heart failure in a month according to 
kop he was hospitalized for nine days early last month suffering 
the same symptoms 
congestive heart failure means the heart is too weak to pump the 
amount of blood required by the body causing chest pain shortness 
of breath and fatigue it can be fatal 
tomas gomez the philippine consul general here repeated his 
assertions thursday that marcos exaggerated his medical plight 
there is no doubt the guy is ill but he already has a 
minihospital at his home so his hospitalization and the media 
hoopla that surrounds it is a little fishy gomez said 
marcos lawyers worked in honolulu on thursday on their strategy 
for a jan 19 hearing in new york to determine whether marcos is 
healthy enough to be arraigned there 
u s district judge john keenan is to base his decision on 
medical evidence presented by the us attorneys office which 
contends marcos is healthy enough to travel and testimony for the 
defense which says hes not 
marcos and his wife imelda were indicted oct 21 on federal 
racketeering charges accusing them of plundering the philippines 
economy and stashing much of the money in the united states 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on 5 
million bail but marcos has not been arraigned because of ill 
health 
the marcoses have lived in exile here since they were ousted in a 
february 1986 popular uprising

her joy tempered by bitterness the mother 
of a pardoned prison inmate said thursday that her son was 
railroaded into serving nearly four years for a murder he never 
committed 
i think we have every right to be bitter said mel shapiro 
the mother of david vasquez the system is too political if we 
had been wealthy we could have bought our way out of it like a lot 
of other people do 
vasquez 42 was released wednesday from the buckingham 
correctional center in dillwyn where he was serving a 35year 
sentence for seconddegree murder after gov gerald l baliles 
signed an order granting him executive clemency 
baliles granted the full pardon after new evidence surfaced 
indicating that timothy spencer convicted of murdering two other 
women also killed the woman vasquez was accused of murdering 
carolyn jean hamm a 35yearold washington lawyer 
ms shapiro said both she and her son were too excited to sleep 
on his first night at home and vasquez was too excited to open 
his christmas presents theyre still under the tree 
every once in a while id just reach out and touch him and be 
glad hes at home where he belongs ms shapiro said in a 
telephone interview from her manassas home 
vasquez finally went to sleep about 6 am and was still asleep 
at midday 
ms shapiro said the family may take legal action either against 
the state or against the defense counsel who encouraged vasquez to 
plead guilty to seconddegree murder to avoid a possible death 
sentence 
but no amount of money can ever erase the bitterness and 
heartache weve been put through she said 
ms shapiro said police and prosecutors railroaded and 
brainwashed vasquez they told him they had his fingerprints 
and they didnt they told him he was seen at the scene of the 
crime but he wasnt he was at home with me 
ms hamm was raped and hanged from a pipe in the basement of her 
arlington home in january 1984 
the crime occurred 35 miles from where we live ms shapiro 
said david doesnt drive how was he supposed to get over there 
thats a question they never did answer 
ms shapiro said she is thankful that baliles granted the pardon 
but is upset with him for not acting sooner she had hoped her son 
would be home for christmas 
he went on vacations and sort of put this under the rug ms 
shapiro said i tried to call him a number of times but he was 
never available i never talked to anyone but his secretaries 
the pardon recommended by arlington commonwealths attorney 
helen fahey was reviewed by the virginia parole board the 
secretary of the commonwealths office and the governors executive 
staff it was placed on baliles desk in october 
the new evidence that led to the pardon involved dna testing 
also known as genetic fingerprinting in such tests the 
molecular structure of body fluds and tissues from a crime scene is 
matched with that of the suspect 
dna tests were used for the first time to convict spencer of the 
murders of susan tucker of arlington and debbie davis of richmond 
such evidence indicated that spencer also killed ms hamm 
spencer who faces two death sentences is scheduled to go to 
trial jan 17 in richmond circuit court for the murder of dr susan 
elizabeth hellams 32

although loans to third world countries wont 
cause us banks to fail the banks will still need to absorb 
billions of dollars in losses the house banking committee was told 
thursday 
the major money center banks responsible for 85 percent of the 
outstanding loans to the six biggest third world borrowers should 
double the reserves they set aside to cover their exposure said 
kenneth pinkes a vice president of moodys credit rating service 
the debtor countries which have born a significant share of 
adjustment costs appear less willing to continue the rescheduling 
process pinkes said 
more importantly he said as the possibility of a major 
financial crisis appears less likely the priority of the us 
government seems to have shifted from the need to help the major 
money center banks to the need to maintain political stability in 
latin america 
the major banks which saw their credit rating plummet after the 
third world debt crisis appeared in 1982 have set aside reserves 
equal to about 25 percent of their exposure to cover losses on the 
loans in the past two years 
but they havent written the loans off and are still trying to 
collect interest or swap them for equity shares in companies in the 
lesser developed countries 
prices in the secondary market and the magnitude of the 
singlerisk exposures suggest a reserve level of at least 50 
percent pinkes said if the loans are only worth 40 cents on 
the dollar ultimately the accounting is going to have to catch up 
with that 
federal banking regulators acknowledged the exposure of the nine 
money center banks is still too large but said they no longer face 
the danger of failing if the borrowers default 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said most of the regional banks have put the ldc less 
developed countries debt problem behind them 
manuel h johnson vice chairman of the federal reserve board 
said us bank exposure to the 15 major third world debtors declined 
by 86 billion between july 1987 and the same month last year to 
76 billion 
a disproportionate share of this reduction was accounted for by 
large regional banks as distinct from the largest multinational 
banks he said nonetheless the top nine banks reduced their 
total exposure over the year by 26 billion to 53 billion 
meanwhile the debt servicing capacity of the six largest 
borrowers argentina brazil chile mexico the philippines and 
venezuela well exceeds the 40 percent value the secondary market 
is now putting on the loans seidman said 
those countries account for 47 billion or 85 percent of the 
third world debt exposure of the nine money center banks bank of 
america manufacturers hanover continental illinois bankers trust 
jp morgan first chicago chase manhattan chemical and citicorp 
even in what surely could be considered a worstcase scenario 
each of the nine money center banks could write off 100 percent of 
their outstanding loans to these six countries and on an aftertax 
basis each of these banks would remain solvent seidman said

quieter than it has been at some times otherwise things are pretty 
much back to normal 
but members of the clergy and therapists trying to ease the pain 
and bewilderment of the families and the towns 400 residents say 
effects probably will linger long after the funerals 
it left a big gap in this community said the rev jon

first couple of days people just kind of walked around speechless 
investigators have ruled out a basement wood furnace as the 
source of the blaze elmer h baltes a deputy state fire marshal 
said faulty wiring still is considered a possibility but the cause 
may never be known conclusively because the intense fire destroyed

the narrow case that independent counsel 
lawrence walsh has carved out against oliver north targets the 
coverup of the irancontra money diversion and contains the charges 
even walshs critics thought were most likely to succeed 
but the former white house aide would no longer be charged with a 
direct crime for diverting money from iranian arms sales to the 
nicaraguan contras 
walsh proposed thursday to skirt a raging dispute over what 
classified documents can be introduced by defense and prosecution by 
dropping charges of conspiracy and theft of government property 
those were the only remaining counts which charged a crime in 
diverting the money 
but if us district judge gerhard gesell accepts walshs motion 
north would still face 12 charges 
those 12 carry a cumulative maximum penalty of 60 years in 
prison and 3 million in fines although federal judges simply do 
not sentence first offenders to consecutive maximum penalties on 
all counts which produce guilty verdicts 
nine of these counts charge north with trying to prevent 
discovery of his activities on behalf of the contras including 
misleading congress and attorney general edwin meese and shredding 
and altering government documents 
the three other counts charge north with accepting a gratuity 
converting money to personal use and scheming to defraud the 
treasury of tax revenue 
of the nine coverupbased counts four relate directly to 
concealing the diversion of arms sale money 
it is these four that longtime government prosecutors speaking 
privately always thought were walshs strongest charges 
from the outset walsh confronted some legal problems the boland 
amendment barring aid to the contras did not carry its own criminal 
penalties some had argued it did not apply to the national security 
council where north worked 
the conspiracy charge that walsh fashioned to embrace the entire 
diversion effort was by no means unprecedented but it was an 
aggressive use of the law to deal with these legal problems even 
former top justice department officials were more comfortable with 
the theft of government property charge which was based on the 
diversion of the arm sale money 
but walshs allies and critics alike were most impressed with 
four coverup charges based on norths actions after the sale of 
usbuilt missiles to iran was disclosed in early november 1986 
these counts charge north with obstructing congress obstructing 
a presidential inquiry by meese false statements and removing 
falsifying and destroying official documents 
the obstruction of congress count charges north helped draft a 
false chronology to guide testimony by administration officials to 
congress walsh charges he did this by having the document falsely 
claim that no us official learned before january 1986 that hawk 
missiles had been sold to iran in november 1985 this count also 
charges him with altering destroying and removing national security 
council documents between nov 2125 1986 that discussed the arms 
sales and aid to the contras 
the count of obstructing meeses factfinding inquiry for 
president reagan charges north with falsely telling meese in the 
attorney generals office on nov 23 that the national security 
council had no involvement in the diversion this count also 
mentions the document destruction and removal 
the false statements count charges north with falsely telling 
meese at the same meeting that the israelis determined how much of 
the arms sale proceeds went to the contras this count also charges 
that north falsely advised meese that he had told contra leader 
adolfo calero to open swiss accounts to receive that money when he 
knew that the money had gone in accounts controlled by the 
secordhakim enterprise 
the document destruction count says that from midnovember until 
norths office was sealed by security agents on nov 25 1986 he 
altered destroyed and removed documents about the arms sales and 
aid to the contras 
for the document case walsh gave immunity early on to norths 
secretary fawn hall in return for her description later the public 
heard her describe the shredding for congress to document the money 
flow walsh has swiss bank records and the cooperation of hakims 
associate willard zucker 
meese testified at length to walshs grand jury surely including 
what north told him other participants in drafting the phony 
chronology have recounted norths role 
the other five coverupbased accounts charge north with falsely 
denying or causing others to falsely deny to congress that north was 
using other means to help the contras with cash and military advice 
besides the arms sale diversion these counts are all based on 
events before the arms sale was disclosed 
the final three counts charge north with 
taking a 13800 security system for his home from secord in 
returning for steering the irancontra business to secord 
paying personal expenses out of 4300 in travelers checks 
given to him by calero to help free us hostages in lebanon 
and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue on 32 
million donated to the rightwing national endowment for the 
preservation of liberty by telling donors gifts were taxexempt when 
they were actually used for the nontaxexempt purpose of military 
aid to the contras

defense funds annual survey on child care funding released thursday 
with increasing numbers of women working the number of children 
needing child care also is growing yet states have received little 
help from the federal government the childrens advocacy group said 
between 1981 and 1987 the number of working mothers with 
children younger than 6 rose by 23 percent said the sixth annual 
survey state child care fact book 1988 
yet during that period 26 states spent less in fiscal year 1988 
for child care funded through the title xx social services block 
grant the largest federal source of direct child care assistance to 
poor families than they did in fiscal 1981 when the dollars are 
adjusted for inflation the report said 
in addition 23 states are serving fewer children now than they 
did in seven years ago the group said 
state child care efforts are too few scattered and underfunded 
to do the job the report said states alone will not be able or 
willing to help the large number of lowincome families needing 
child care assistance nor will the states alone build a child care 
system that ensures that all families have access to quality care 
the group called on congress to approve the act for better child 
care services which would authorize 25 billion to help low and 
moderateincome families pay for child care to help states and the 
private sector increase the supply of child care services and to 
assure a minimum of safe child care

nightmare her head got caught in the bedrail and she strangled to 
death

morning of nov 21 dispensing medicine and setting up intravenous 
feedings she saw several staff members asleep in chairs and covered 
with sheets 
she said she didnt awaken them because she was not authorized to 
do so and in the past had been threatened by some workers

the five candidates to succeed paul kirk as 
chairman of the democratic national committee met with labor leaders 
thursday in hopes of winning union backing 
the meetings were at aflcio headquarters in washington with a 
number of political directors from the organizations member unions 
meeting with each of the candidates 
the political directors each will report back to their unions 
president the presidents in turn plan to meet next week with 
aflcio president lane kirkland to determine whether labor will 
issue an endorsement 
thursdays meetings were the official forum to seek labors 
backing but the candidates in the past few weeks have met regularly 
with union leaders according to aflcio officials 
washington attorney ron brown a veteran party activist who was 
jesse jacksons 1988 convention manager and has worked for sen 
edward m kennedy and michigan state chairman richard weiner are 
considered the frontrunners to succeed kirk 
three former democratic representatives are the other candidates 
they are jim jones of oklahoma michael barnes of maryland and james 
stanton of ohio 
although the aflcio has not decided as yet whether to endorse a 
number its building trades unions have endorsed stanton 
brown who also worked on michael dukakis unsuccessful 1988 
presidential campaign has won the backing of several prominent 
democrats including labor favorites kennedy and new york gov mario 
cuomo 
the aflcio endorsed dukakis in the presidential race although 
the teamsters union an aflcio affiliate later backed republican 
george bush 
when the union presidents meet with kirkland no endorsement is 
likely to follow unless they agree to present it as unanimous 
regardless of any debate in their closed session 
the democratic national committee will meet on feb 910 to 
choose kirks replacement unions delegates hold 46 of the 404 
national committee votes but labors influence is far greater than 
those number would suggest

longrange conservation program to reduce annual soil losses by 
nearly 600 million tons the agriculture department said thursday 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said about 28 million acres have been contracted under the 
conservation reserve program or crp the goal is to retire 40 
million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop 
production by 1990 
an agency spokeswoman leslie wilder said the 600 million tons 
of soil saved each year would be enough to cover one square mile or 
640 acres to a depth of 429 feet 
scaling said the average annual erosion rate on crp land declines 
to less than 2 tons per acre after being planted in grass or trees 
from 22 tons per acre before 
under the program farmers agree to take qualified land from crop 
production for 10 years in return they get federal assistance to 
plant the land in protective grass or trees and then draw annual 
rental payments those average around 49 per acre each year

anguished residents of this small farming 
community struggled thursday to understand why a 27yearold mother 
drowned her 8yearold daughter in a bathtub and then shot her three 
younger children and herself 
people keep asking me why like i know the answer and i dont 
and everyone is asking themselves what if we had known we 
could have tried to help said karen dingerson who lived nearby 
the bodies of sheila epker and the four children were found by 
the womans husband greg epker 32 when he returned home wednesday 
from work authorities said 
the couples eldest child 8yearold casey was drowned mrs 
epker and the three other chidren daughters shannon 5 and mandy 
2 and 1yearson lance were shot in the head with a 22caliber 
revolver said adams county sheriff robert nall 
the children were sweet cute just as cute as buttons the 
oldest one was always ushering the others around mrs dingerson 
said 
epker was being treated for shock at st marys hospital in the 
county seat of quincy 10 miles to the south mendon is about 140 
miles northwest of st louis 
hes completely mystified nall said he cant understand 
it either 
there were few clues to a motive for the five deaths he said 
mrs epker had no known history of mental problems and the family 
apparently had only minor financial problems 
but the quincy heraldwhig reported thursday that st marys 
hospital had sued the epkers over 3900 in bills accumulated since 
1980 the hospital won the judgment and epkers wages were 
garnisheed dec 28 the newspaper said 
neighbors said the family had lived for about seven years in 
their modest onestory house on the outskirts of this town of nearly 
1000 residents they described mrs epker as a slender blonde 
woman outwardly cheerful but having little contact with neighbors 
vera oenning said mrs epker had spoken to her only once in seven 
years although the two families lived about 50 yards apart 
she would wave or smile but she never came over or had any 
conversations with me mrs oenning said they never did too 
much visiting and youd never see too many people over there 
all but the eldest child apparently died without a struggle the 
sheriff said mrs epker apparently tried to strangle casey before 
drowning the child in the bathtub nall said 
authorities believe she then took her three younger children into 
the kitchen where she laid out pillows and blankets and turned on a 
gas stove in an apparent attempt to asphyxiate the family 
we believe that because that didnt work quickly enough 
because of despair she took them into the living room one by one 
and shot them nall told reporters 
caseys classmates at at mendon elementary school were 
bewildered said principal dean herring adding a psychologist was 
standing by 
i dont see something as tragic as this passing over in a 
couple of days its something we will be dealing with for a

the nations first fullscale 
governmentsponsored hypodermic needle exchange program to combat 
the spread of aids has been approved by the tacomapierce county 
board of health 
the panel voted 41 wednesday to spend 43165 this year on the 
program begun in august by david purchase a former drug counselor 
who began with a card table and a box of donated syringes 
purchase estimated wednesday that he has distributed more than 
11000 clean needles in an attempt to reduce the spread of aids 
among addicts who commonly share syringes while injecting themselves 
with drugs police and other officials estimate the city has about 
3000 intravenous drug users 
thats history that really is history purchase said after 
the vote 
we have the most successful program in the us the first and 
the most successful said pierce county executive joe stortini a 
member of the board 
im not convinced that the needle exchange by itself has done 
a thing to stop the spread of aids said greg mykland a city 
councilman who is a member of the health board and cast the lone 
dissenting vote 
ive never heard of anything i could have supported less a year 
or two ago said county council member barbara skinner another 
board member but ive heard that it costs 100000 to treat 
someone with aids and a needle costs 35 cents that sounds like a 
pretty good deal to me 
the money was designated for paying purchase to spend five 
afternoons a week running two mobile clinics that provide needles 
aids information and drug treatment coupons 
a smaller needle exchange project modeled partly on purchases 
example was started recently by health officials in new york but 
has enrolled only 34 of the citys 250000 addicts and and is 
designed primarily as a research effort 
a private nonprofit organization in portland ore announced 
thursday that it had hired a nurse to begin a needle distribution 
program there the program was first announced last june but was 
stalled for months when the clinic was unable to find an insurance 
company to cover the program 
in boston mayor raymond flynn backed a needle exchange program 
but it was rejected by the city council 
an organization headquartered in boston called the aids brigade 
which includes yale graduate students as well as former addicts and 
convicts distributes aids education materials bleach and needles 
in new haven conn new york city new jersey and boston 
tacoma is really leading the way nationally on this said don 
des jarlais director of the new york state division of substance 
abuse services 
onefifth of the nations 80000 reported cases of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome have been in intravenous drug users and 
the fatal disease is spreading in that population faster than any 
other health officials say 
studies of european needle exchange programs show no increase in 
drug use and a sharp decrease in needlesharing habits said terry 
reid manager of the the health departments drug abuse and aids 
programs

tanker and were trying to keep it afloat the executives said at 
nightfall it was listing heavily and still burning they reported 
last april 4 when the iraniraq war was still raging iranian 
gunboats attacked the sagheera setting it afire near the strait of 
hormuz the fire was put out and no one was hurt 
lloyds which monitors shipping traffic around the world said 
on thursday that the vessel was reported to be abandoned and no 
further details were available 
an explosion tore through the tankers pump room before the ship 
caught fire lloyds reported but it did not say what might have 
caused the blast 
executives theorized that a mine from the iraniraq war may have 
been whipped loose from its mooring by fierce winds 
it could be the work of a mine but it could also be an 
internal explosion one of the oil tanks catching fire and 
exploding one said 
scores of mines are believed spread about the gulf and the 
arabian sea more than four months after a ceasefire took effect in 
the gulf war 
the empty tanker was steaming from fujairah on the arabian sea to 
the loading port in saudi arabia mina saud lloyds said 
it said the sagheera caught fire just outside omani territorial 
waters before the bend of the vshaped hormuz strait 
lloyds said a big oil slick formed 
the shipping executives ruled out the possibility of an attack by 
an iranian speedboat saying the weather was too bad for such 
vessels to operate approaching the sagheera to quench the fire 
lloyds said the sagheera is owned by the dammambased general 
contracting importing and service enterprises general bunkering 
services dammam and managed by the avin international bunkers 
supply sa based in piraeus greece 
early thursday bad weather caused the 9724ton honduranflag 
freighter moajil5 to run aground after it broke anchor in rough 
seas according to gulf and london shipping sources who spoke on 
condition of anonytmiy 
no casualties were reported when the moajil5 grounded on the

the agriculture department has issued a sun 
scald alert for trees particularly in the upper midwest and 
northeast an agency official said thursday 
its possible that some damage may have already occurred from 
what we call sun scald said horticulturist mark p widrlechner of 
the departments agricultural research service but if you act 
fairly soon chances are very good that you can protect your trees 
sun scald is caused by a rapid fluctuation of temperatures in 
winter he said the sun warms tree bark to above freezing allowing 
water to flow freely up and down inside the trunk and branches when 
it is cold at night the water freezes cracking the bark and 
injuring the tree 
widrlechner said tree trunks in many midwestern apple orchards 
are painted white to reflect heat away from the bark homeowners 
though can simply wrap tree trunks with paper coverings available 
at garden and hardware stores

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday it plans to forbid use of granular carbofuran a pesticide 
used mostly to protect corn and sorghum from worms and insects 
because it is killing too many birds 
the agency said it knew of more than 40 incidents where birds had 
mistaken the pesticide granules on the ground for food with up to 
1000 bird deaths in a single incident 
in addition eagles hawks harriers and other birds of prey have 
been killed from eating the carcasses of smaller birds that died 
after eating carbofuran granules epa said 
at least 20 species of birds legally protected under various 
federal laws have been killed by carbofuran the agency concluded 
about 6 million to 9 million pounds of granular carbofuran are 
sold each year another 1 million to 3 million pounds are sold as 
liquids or powders used in different applications and are not 
involved in thursdays announcement 
about twothirds of the granular form is used on corn that form 
of use less common than it was 10 years ago epa said the main form 
of granular carbofuran is sold as furadan by fmc corp 
it is only the second time epa has acted to ban a pesticide 
solely because it was killing birds though harm to birds was a 
major reason for the ban on ddt in 1972 the other banned chemical 
was diazinon 
the agency said it did not appear that carbofuran posed any 
chronic threat to humans though like other pesticides high 
concentrations could make it a shortterm poison 
epa began a special study of carbofuran in 1985 but that review 
was slowed by the agencys conclusion that it needed to study all 
granulated pesticides more than 100 chemicals for their effect 
on birds to set priorities for further work 
field tests were recently completed and will be reviewed by the 
agencys outside science advisers next month 
carbofuran was orders of magnitude several factors of 10 
greater in toxicity than any other pesticide said al heier epas 
pesticide spokesman on a toxicity scale to birds of one to 10 it 
was the only one rated a 10 and the next most toxic was a five 
the fish and wildlife service advised epa that carbofuran posed a 
threat to three endangered species the aplomado falcon attwaters 
greater prairie chicken and the aleutian canada goose and could 
harm the bald eagle the whooping crane and the mississippi sandhill 
crane the chemical should be banned in areas used by those species 
the service recommended 
epa said it knew of population declines in the redshouldered 
hawk the loggerhead shrike the field sparrow henslows sparrow 
and other species given its high toxicity and its widespread use 
in agriculture carbofuran is likely to be responsible for bird 
deaths in those species and therefore can be an important 
additive factor in the declines 
in chicago fmc corp spokeswoman patricia brozowski said 
natrually were disappointed but at the same time we are 
confident that comprehensive and welldocumented information 
from the scientific and agricultural communities will support our 
position that furadan does not present an unreasonable risk to avian 
species 
the agency said it had considered tightening the current use 
restrictions on carbofuran but concluded such actions as additional 
label warnings limits on use to certain months or geographic 
restrictions would not adequately mitigate the risk 
growers who use carbofuran on their crops should incur higher 
annual costs of 23 million to 33 million through increased crop 
damage and higher costs for other pesticides epa said but there 
are so many choices for corn the carbofuran ban should have no major 
effect on corn farmers epa said 
the biggest single loss would be to rice growers 12 million a 
year in losses to the rice water weevil for which no other control 
chemicals are available 
epa said it would receive public comment on its plans for 60 
days if it orders a ban the manufacturer and other holders of 
federal pesticide licenses may pursue administrative appeals if 
they do so sales of the pesticide may continue

secretary of state george p shultz sharply 
criticized on thursday a reported death threat by yasser arafat 
against palestinian arabs who advocate an end to the uprising on the 
israeliheld west bank and gaza 
we will observe behavior as the process proceeds shultz said 
last month acting on the secretarys recommendation president 
reagan ended a 13year ban on us talks with arafats palestine 
liberation organization 
the decision was suggested by the state department and taken on 
the basis of statements by the plo chairman that he had renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
shultz said in a news conference aboard the us air force jet 
that brought him to paris for a chemical warfare conference that not 
all violence is an act of terrorism 
but threats against people who try to move in a calmer and more 
peaceful direction are acts of intimidation and fall much more into 
the terrorism category he said 
shultz stressed he had not seen the reported statement by arafat 
but he criticized it nonetheless 
bethlehem mayor elias freij one of the west banks bestknown 
moderates proposed just before christmas a oneyear truce in the 
palestian uprising in the occupied territories as a step toward 
peace 
freij told reporters this week he was withdrawing the proposal 
after arafat said in saudi arabia on sunday that anyone trying to 
stop the revolt exposes himself to the bullets of our people 
shultz referred to a us session with a plo delegation in 
carthage tunisia on dec 16 
we have emphasized the importance of stopping terrorism now we 
have to keep working on it to see that their behavior measures up 
he said 
assistant secretary of state richard w murphy and other senior 
us officials have warned that the substantive dialogue with 
the plo would be cut off if terrorism recurred 
meanwhile the state department disclosed on thursday that us 
diplomats were given the green light to exchange social pleasantries 
with plo representatives if they should meet them at parties 
arafats comment came at a rally sunday marking the anniversary 
of his fatah movement 
freij said he could not believe arafat made such a threatening 
statement 
in bethlehem on thursday soldiers ordered residents to paint 
over graffiti threatening freij with death 
the slogans signed by the radical plo faction popular front for 
the liberation of palestine included shame on all the traitors 
and the fate of freij will not be better than that of zafer al 
masri 
masri mayor of nablus was killed in 1986 after indications he 
might play a role in the peace process with israel the popular 
front claimed responsibility for his slaying 
freij maintained that city workers and some shopkeepers 
voluntarily painted over the graffiti he denied reports he had been 
in hiding

indian peacekeeping troops have begun 
leaving this troubled island at the end of an 18month mission to 
disarm tamil rebels and enforce a ceasefire officials said 
thursday 
also thursday officials reopened more than 10000 schools 
nationwide that were closed two months ago after a wave of student 
unrest 
officials confirmed that india has begun its longawaited 
withdrawal from the country 
some indian troops have already left sri lanka during the past 
two days and another battalion is scheduled to leave sunday said 
gurjit singh a spokeman for the indian high commission or embassy 
india the regional superpower sent its troops to sri lanka in 
july 1987 hours after the two countries signed an accord to end the 
tamil separarist war for an independent homeland in the north and 
east provinces more than 8500 people have died since the fighting 
began in 1983 
but the biggest and most militant tamil group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam rejected the accord saying that it failed to 
meet their demands for selfrule 
the presence of about 47000 indian troops in sri lanka triggered 
resentment among tamils and sinhalese the countrys ethnic majority 
the indian troops soon became caught in the fighting and more 
than 625 soldiers have been killed 
shortly after his election last month president ranasinghe 
premadasa asked the indian government to start pulling its troops 
out of sri lanka 
india announced on sunday that between 2000 and 3000 troops 
would leave the indian ocean island this week it said the remaining 
soldiers would be gradually withdrawn but gave no timetable 
premadasa had opposed the accord which was signed by his 
predecessor junius r jayewardene both are sinhalese 
an extremist sinhalese group the peoples liberation front also 
objects to the peace accord saying it grants too many concessions 
to the mostly hindu tamils who make up 18 percent of the countrys 
16 million people 
the tamils contend the predominantly buddhist sinhalese denies 
them jobs education and money for development the sinhalese 
account for over 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and military 
meanwhile principals reported satisfactory to good attendance at 
the countrys 10400 schools closed by the government on nov 10 
after widespread student unrest rioting and police action that left 
at least 20 students dead 
police and troops were ordered to stay away from schools 
thursday and there were no indications of trouble said elmo 
gooneratne an education ministry official 
sri lanka has a literacy rate of 86 percent the highest in asia 
there was no indication when seven of sri lankas eight 
universities would reopen the colleges closed in mid1987 because 
of student unrest 
schools and college campuses have been used by the peoples 
liberation front as recruiting centers for its cause

the security council convened in an 
emergency session thursday and heard libya and the united states 
trade blame for the downing of two libyan jets by us warplanes 
libyas ambassador ali suni muntasser told the council that the 
united states is pursuing a policy of blatant aggression against 
his country 
libya repeated thursday that the jets were unarmed reconnaissance 
planes washington disputed that contending two us navy fighter 
jets acted in selfdefense when they shot down the libyan mig jets 
on wednesday 
our actions were fully consistent with accepted international 
norms of selfdefense and my government considers this matter 
closed us ambassador herbert s okun told the council 
us planes were faced by growing and imminent threat of being 
shot down by intercepting libyan aircraft he said we have 
photographic evidence that clearly shows the libyan aircraft were 
carrying airtoair missiles 
libya sought the urgent council session and urged the 15member 
body to condemn the us action as premeditated aggression but the 
united states one of five permanent members with veto power would 
kill any resolution of condemnation 
the session was adjourned after remarks by eight speakers made 
comments most of them arab represenatives who condemned the us 
military action speakers included the arab league bahrain burkina 
faso tunisia syria and cuba 
the session will reconvene friday at 1030 am est for further 
debate including comments from britain and the soviet union the 
council is expected to consider a resolution of condemnaion being 
drafted by libya and the nonaligned movement 
at the meeting muntasser accused the united states of 
premeditated deliberate aggression a prelude to largescale act 
of aggression aimed at sriking the economic and military 
installations in my country 
he protested the shooting down of two unarmed reconaissance 
planes on routine patrol near the libyan coast they were 
intercepted by us military aircraft which shot them down without 
any justification 
muntasser responding to us charges that libya is about to 
produce chemical weapons said libya has no intention of 
producing chemical weapons he said libya scrupulously abides by 
all international bans and conventions against the use of outlawed 
poison gasses 
before the meeting muntasser called the chief pentagon spokesman 
a liar and rejected us claims that videotapes show two libyan 
jets were armed and hostile before they were shot down over the 
mediterranean 
i would say that he is a liar not me the man who said i am a 
liar he is a liar because we are sure that our planes were not 
armed he told reporters 
pentagon spokesman dan howard had said thursday that the libyan 
envoy was a liar by asserting that the mig23s were unarmed and 
on reconnaissance 
muntasser suggested the united states had doctored the videotapes 
or had fraudulently used film of other armed libyan fighters 
we can as well bring pictures that our plane has no missiles 
he said also thursday soviet un ambassador alexander m 
belonogov suggested to reporters the two us f14 pilots were 
triggerhappy and said the kremlin warned the united states before 
the event to exercise restraint with libya 
we deplore this accident belonogov said everything that 
has a tragic ending is an accident 
he said it demonstrated that all military personnel should be 
under strong instructions not to be too quick to pull the trigger 
before that incident we gave a warning signal to washington to 
show restraint in that area not to raise tension in the area 
he said we were concerned by this us antilibyan campaign in 
connection with the socalled chemical weapons plant 
the ambassador urged the united states to consider libyas offer 
of inspection of a plant 60 miles southwest of tripoli the libyan 
capital that washington says produces chemical weapons libya says 
it manufactures medicines 
us officials have denied any connection between the air action 
and allegations about the chemical plant 
meanwhile arab league sources in tunis tunisia said libya also 
made a formal request thursday for a meeting of the leagues council 
of ministers

aflcio president lane kirkland urged 
presidentelect bush on thursday to use a new us trade law 
aggressively to punish nations considered to be violating workers 
rights 
as good as it looks on paper the reality remains elusive 
kirkland said in a speech to an international labor conference he 
was referring to provisions of the law that allow the united states 
to close its markets to nations engaging in unfair trade practices 
including denial of workers rights 
the translation of principle into fact will require on our part 
relentless work for a long time yet kirkland said what we have 
gained amounts to little more than words if not aggressively pursued 
by an administration whose appointees really believe in these 
things words gestures promises and formal procedures in and of 
themselves do not bring relief to exploited workers nor freedom to 
anyone 
kirkland reiterated labors request that the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade be amended to include a social clause defining 
denial of workers rights as an unfair trade practice he said he 
hoped that could be accomplished during the current uruguay 
round of trade talks but conceded past efforts have fallen far 
short of success 
in broader terms he said as we embark upon a new presidential 
administration in washington a new opportunity emerges to frame a 
foreign policy worthy of the purposes for which democratic 
government was brought forth on this continent 
there can be no bigger test of that policy than the extent of 
its commitment to the advancement of human rights beginning with 
the basic rights of working people kirkland said the 
enforcement of the workers rights provision of our trade laws will 
and ought to be the crucible of that test

the population of the tristate chesapeake 
bay area will increase by 26 million people by the year 2020 and 
could threaten efforts to clean up the bay unless there is strict 
controls by the states involved a report said thursday 
the report on the consequences of population growth and 
development in the bays watershed was presented to the governors of 
virginia maryland and pennsylvania at a meeting of the chesapeake 
executive council 
the council which also includes officials from the district of 
columbia and the federal environmental protection agency has been 
coordinating broad efforts to environmentally restore chesapeake bay 
and its tributaries after years of neglect 
the governors reserved detailed judgement on the report pending 
closer study 
but gov robert casey of pennsylvania said he had serious 
reservations about the draconian state planning measures 
suggested by the report which was prepared at the request of the 
executive council 
he said pennsylvania need not become a super planner to deal 
with future growth in the bay region and cited programs the state 
already has underway to deal with improved sewage treatment waste 
recycling and control of toxic wastes 
govs gerald baliles of virginia and donald schaefer of maryland 
said they plan to establish advisory groups to analyze the 
recommendations 
its too early to make judgements about application of the 
reports findings said baliles who is chairman of the executive 
council 
the study panel cited statistics that showed an expected 26 
million additional residents in the chesapeake bay region by the 
year 2020 a 20 percent increase in population growth in an area 
that currently is to a great extent rural 
and the study concluded the states are not prepared for such 
growth procedures currently being used throughout the bay region 
for managing and providing for growth and development are inadequate 
and must quickly be changed if current trends are to be reversed 
it declared 
better stewardship and management of the land and better 
direction and incentives for appropriate growth are needed the 
panel continued adding it was dismayed by the lack of growth 
management and planning on a state and regional level 
the report concluded the states must take a much more active 
and central role to define and map the upcoming population 
growth so that certain lands such as watersheds forests and 
agricultural areas are protected 
each state it continued should expand public park and 
recreational systems through distribution of money for green belts 
around urbanized areas and public access to waterways 
although the panel gave no estimates on the cost of such a 
program it suggested some money sources 
the panel said the states could establish special trust funds to 
finance capital projects such as the purchase of open lands and 
construction of essential infrastructure 
such a trust fund could be funded by an increase in fuel taxes 
taxes on profits from land sales utility surcharges property 
transfer fees voluntary state income tax checkoff or fees on 
using public recreational lands

gov george deukmejian announced thursday he 
will not seek a third term as governor saying that he wants to 
return to private life for additional new challenges 
the republican governor first elected in 1982 after narrowly 
defeating los angeles mayor tom bradley made the announcement at a 
news conference at the state capitol ending months of speculation 
about his political future 
now i want to rack up two more years of accomplishments before 
i leave office he said the best way for me to do that is by 
not running for a third term 
if he ran again he said the democratcontrolled legislature 
might be reluctant to cooperate with him 
there was no immediate response from democratic leaders about 
deukmejians decision 
i didnt come to public office to set some record of 
longevity he said i came to office to make the state a safer 
place to live 
deukmejian a lawyer did not say whether he hoped to return to 
private law practice but ruled out accepting any federal position 
in washington dc 
i expect to do something in the private sector at this point 
i dont know exactly what it will be he said 
deukmejian 60 was urged by fellow republicans to run a third 
time in order to protect gop lawmakers in the scheduled 1990 
reapportionment process 
reapportionment the redrawing of legislative and congressional 
districts to reflect changes in population is determined by the 
legislature and the governor 
currently democrats dominate both houses and republicans asked 
deukmejian to seek a third term in hopes that his gubernatorial veto 
would shield gop lawmakers from the creation of heavily 
prodemocratic districts 
deukmejian who has been in public life for 27 years was 
considered a potential vice presidential contender by george bush 
during bushs successful presidential campaign 
deukmejian of long beach was elected to the assembly in 1962 
then won election to the state senate in 1966 deukmejian was 
elected attorney general in 1978 and served one term before running 
successfully against bradley for governor four years later 
in 1986 deukmejian was reelected governor again defeating 
bradley

residents of this closeknit town on 
thursday buried two of their own a 10yearold girl and an 
81yearold widow killed when the flaming wreckage of sabotaged pan 
am flight 103 came crashing down 
transport secretary paul channon meanwhile announced tighter 
security measures for cargo and baggage mainly for us airlines at 
airports in britain 
investigators were reportedly focusing on a dozen passengers from 
airports in the middle east believed to have boarded the new 
yorkbound boeing 747 on dec 21 when a bomb killed all 259 people 
aboard and 11 on the ground in the village of lockerbie 
on thursday several hundred mourners attended a requiem mass for 
10yearold joanne flannigan whose parents are still missing and 
presumed dead the girl was the first of lockerbies victims to be 
buried 
death always harsh is almost unbearable and unbelievable in 
these circumstances rev patrick keegans told the mourners at the 
holy trinity roman catholic church 
the service was simple only two sprays of white flowers adorned 
the church and the only music was the unaccompanied singing of 
abide with me and the lord is my shepherd 
but the hearse that carried the girls small coffin to the 
graveyard was covered with wreaths and bouquets of bright flowers 
as it slowly pulled away from the church three women comforted a 
sobbing young girl about joannes age 
a few hours later mourners gathered again at the all saints 
episcopal church for the funeral of 81yearold mary lancaster a 
widow for 26 years 
on wednesday prime minister margaret thatcher us ambassador 
charles price and pan am executives were among 700 people who packed 
into the dryfesdale parish church of the church of scotland to mourn 
all the crash victims 
channon announced the tighter security measures after a 
closeddoor meeting of the national aviation security committee 
as a result of the meeting this afternoon i have decided 
immediately to take further steps to increase safety of the security 
of cargo also mislaid luggage and also to take further steps to 
tighten up the existing regulations on cabin bags he said 
there will be more rigorous searching on american airlines and 
on any airline where we think the threat is commensurate but at the 
moment it will be american airlines he said 
he gave no other details about the measures or the committee 
meeting but said he would soon take further measures which he would 
not specify 
londons evening standard newspaper reported experts probing the 
disaster were concentrating on the 12 passengers of the plane who 
began their trips from airports in the middle east 
the fear is that their baggage checked in as destined for new 
york at airports with much less stringent checks than london may 
have been put on to the doomed jet without further security tests 
the report said 
it said one may have been a suicide bomber or someone duped to 
carry a bomb the report said 
press association the british domestic news agency said it was 
told by an unidentified fbi spokesman in washington we are aware 
of this report but we are not in a position to discuss our 
investigation publicly 
pan am had no comment on the report 
the government also announced thursday a 18 million rebuilding 
program in the scottish town where buildings were destroyed by 
falling wreckage 
searchers so far have recovered 242 bodies from the crash and 
have released 164 of them for burial 
officials say they believe some of the 28 still missing may have 
been cremated in the crash that left a 30footdeep crater in the 
town

moslem police facing murder 
charges seized the police chief of the western island of mindanao 
and his chief of staff thursday and threatened to burn down the 
city officials said 
negotiations for the release of brig gen eduardo batalla 
regional philippine constabulary commander and col romeo abendan 
continued until dawn friday 
there was no official word to indicate when the hostages might be 
released heavily armed troops surrounded the headquarters building 
where the hostages were being held 
conflicting reports said one and possibly two people were killed 
when the moslem police attacked about noon thursday in batallas 
office at a seaside military compound in this city 560 miles south 
of manila 
in manila the radio station dzrh said the estimated 15 policemen 
and their supporters led by patrolman rizal alih accepted an offer 
by ramon mitra speaker of the house of representatives to be flown 
to palawan island 350 miles west of here the report could not be 
confirmed

photographic evidence shows libya lied when it 
claimed the two planes that the united states shot down over the 
mediterranean sea were unarmed reconnaissance aircraft the reagan 
administration said thursday 
citing video footage from one of two us navy f14 jet fighters 
involved in the confrontation wednesday pentagon spokesman dan 
howard said photos of one of the libyan fighters showed it carrying 
four missiles on its fuselage and wings 
it tells me that the libyan ambassador to the un is a liar 
thats the first thing it tells me howard told a packed pentagon 
news briefing 
theyve gone out yesterday and said repeatedly that those were 
unarmed reconnaissance aircraft well we have the pictures now that 
they were not unarmed aircraft 
they were obviously armed aircraft with obvious hostile intent 
we believe that our aircraft commanders behaved in a prudent manner 
in defending themselves in defending their aircraft and in 
defending their ship he said 
the united states sent a straightforward message to libya 
through diplomatic channels to let them know our point of view 
on the events over the mediterranean sea a state department 
official said thursday speaking on condition of anonymity 
no response from the libyans has been received the official 
added the official said the substance of the message sent 
wednesday paralleled information in defense secretary frank c 
carluccis public briefing on the incident and included the 
asserting that the us action was taken in selfdefense 
the official said the message was sent through the normal 
chennels used by the united states to contact the libyans the 
belgian embassy which represents us interests in tripoli and the 
united arab emirates embassy in washington which represents libyan 
interests in the united states 
at the united nations the soviet ambassador alexander m 
belonogov told reporters thursday that moscow gave a warning 
signal to washington before the american jet fighters shot down 
the libyan planes to show restraint and not to raise the tension 
in the area he refused to elaborate 
we deplore this accident belonogov said it shows the 
seriousness of the situation and that all military personnel should 
be under strong instructions not to be too quick to pull the 
trigger 
the united states told the un security council that the us 
planes fired on the libyan aircraft in reaction to hostile actions 
that constituted an armed attack on american forces 
us ambassador herbert s okun made the statement in a letter to 
the 15member council which held private consultations on libyas 
protest of the incident but libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser 
called the incident a premeditated act of aggression and said 
the libyan fighters were unarmed on routine reconnaissance 
ordinary flying 
president reagan boarding his plane in los angeles to return to 
washington following a vacation told reporters our pilots acted 
completely in selfdefense 
asked about libyan leader moammar gadhafis statement accusing 
the united states of terrorist actions reagan sad i havent 
believed what he said for a long time 
meantime the state department on thursday welcomed britains 
announcement that it had independent confirmation that libya is 
building a plant to produce chemical weapons as the united states 
has alleged libya contends the factory will produce pharmaceuticals 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley also confirmed that libya 
has attempted some backchannel contacts with the united states 
recently but she refused to define the substance of the messages or 
how they were transmitted 
the problem is not one of communication the problem is the 
policy and the conduct of the government of libya their policy 
particularly in support of terrorism she said 
speaking to reporters on a flight thursday from washington to 
paris for an international conference secretary of state george p 
shultz hinted the united states may be willing to work out a deal 
with libya that would not require the plant to be destroyed 
obviously if the facility were destroyed that would take care 
of the problem so thats our posture shultz said but he added 
whether there is something else that can be done well see 
he said the united states was not talking directly to the libyans 
about the plant but that the two sides were able to communicate 
through intermediaries 
shultz also reiterated that the air incident was unrelated to the 
plant dispute he said the libyan planes engaged in aggressive 
behavior toward the american planes but he said the incident 
must show libyas uneasiness about the fact that they have 
constructed this chemical weapons complex 
the los angeles times reported thursday that libya had initiated 
secret overtures to the united states in recent months in hopes of 
avoiding an armed confrontation with the most recent contact coming 
less than 24 hours before the us navy planes downed the libyan 
aircraft 
the times quoting unidentified officials said the overtures 
were rejected because they failed to address us complaints that 
gadhafis regime supports terrorism 
at the pentagon howard declined to make the navy aviators 
available but the video footage was released along with a longer 
audio tape howard also released a blownup still photo taken from 
the videotape which shows missiles hanging from one of the migs 
he said the crew of one of the navy jets involved was flown to 
washington wednesday night and had briefed both himself and top 
military leaders thursday 
carlucci said on wednesday just hours after the incident that 
two f14 tomcats had been flying a routine protective patrol for the 
us aircraft carrier john f kennedy well off the libyan coast when 
they were approached in a hostile manner by two mig23 fighters 
the two american planes ultimately fired four missiles and shot 
down both of the sovietmade aircraft carlucci said dismissing 
suggestions the f14s might have been preparing for an attack on a 
chemical weapons plant now nearing completion inside libya 
on thursday howard offered new details to bolster the american 
account of the event he said the f14s picked up the libyan planes 
on their radar at a range of 72 nautical miles at 1157 am local 
time 
the incident was over by 1203 pm local time with the two migs 
shot down and two parachutes sighted floating to the water howard 
said 
the pentagon still has no information on the fate of the two 
libyan pilots howard said 
extensive debriefing of the navy officers and a review of the 
video footage shows the mig23 flogger aircraft five times ignored 
evasive maneuvers by the navy jets and kept turning toward the 
americans on a collision course howard said 
even after the lead f14 fired two sparrow missiles the two migs 
did not break off their approach and instead turned and tried to 
jump on the second f14 the spokesman said 
those first two sparrows apparently did not strike their target 
but a third sparrow fired by the second f14 claimed one of the 
migs and the lead f14 was able to pounce on the rear of the other 
mig and down it with a heatseeking sidewinder missile howard said 
howard said the american pilots did not have any indication the 
libyans had turned on their attack radars as had earlier been 
supposed but intercepted radio communications show the libyans had 
some type of radar on their planes operating and searching for the 
f14s howard said

a justice of the peace a deputy 
constable and five tarrant county workers said they thought they 
were winners in a drawing when they received toys and clothing at 
christmas 
but officials in charge of a giveaway program for the needy had 
the employees investigated for fraud after their names showed up on 
a list of recipients 
district attorney tim curry ultimately concluded that no crimes 
were committed the fort worth startelegram reported thursday but 
the district attorney said he was outraged by the bizarre events 
that unfolded at the polytechnic subcourthouse and an adjacent 
welfare agency 
it looks like a comedy of errors and a case of really bad 
judgment by a number of people curry said 
the christmas giveaway program sponsored by overton park 
national bank was administered by the tarrant county department of 
human services 
the problems apparently began when a receptionist at the 
department of human services asked to find families to submit 
applications for the toys distributed request forms to workers at 
the subcourthouse 
the receptionist said she was never told only needy families 
qualified 
applicants were asked the ages and clothing sizes of their 
children and were asked to list their gift requests on a form 
titled overton park national bank christmas wish list 
one worker said she asked for two pairs of snakeskin boots 
barbie dolls a lazer tag game and a big wheel she got the big 
wheel 
our fear at this point is that it will leave a bad taste in 
peoples mouths about helping other people at christmas human 
services director ann hamilton said

a story of robbery and bad blood between drug 
dealers was recounted thursday in a preliminary hearing in a 
7yearold murder case in which the late sexfilm star john holmes 
once was prosecuted 
david lind a convicted drug dealer told how he and holmes and 
two subsequent murder victims planned and carried out a robbery at 
the home of adel nasrallah two days before a quadruple murder in 
laurel canyon 
nasrallah 59 a convicted drug dealer who goes by the name eddie 
nash is charged along with his bodyguard gregory diles 40 in the 
july 1981 slayings the prosecution claims the bludgeon murders were 
carried out in retaliation for the robbery 
the case had been dormant since holmes was acquitted of murder 
charges in 1982 it was resurrected this year when scott thorson a 
former companion of liberace was said to have given authorities 
information linking nasrallah to the killings 
nasrallahs attorneys said thursday they have been told that 
thorson will testify as the last witness in the preliminary hearing 
which is expected to last seven to 10 days 
lind testified that holmes who was involved in drug activities 
with nasrallah suggested the robbery left a door open for the 
robbers to enter and called to alert them when the time was right 
we had been told by holmes there would be a large amount of 
cash and narcotics and jewelry said lind lind said he was the 
first to enter the home confronting diles who was serving 
breakfast to nasrallah 
i believe i yelled freeze police youre under arrest 
said lind who recalled carrying a san francisco policemans badge 
i take it you were not a police officer at that time asked 
deputy district attorney dale davidson 
nor have i ever been said lind who acknowledged numerous 
arrests for robbery as well as drugs 
lind said he was handcuffing diles when accidentally linds gun 
discharged wounding diles he said nasrallah panicked 
he asked permission to say a prayer for him or his children 
he recalled he was on his knees 
lind said he and his accomplices ronald launius and roy 
deverell then forced nasrallah to lead them to a floor safe in a 
closet where they found heroin cocaine jewelry and tens of 
thousands of dollars in cash which they stole 
how did mr nash appear asked davidson 
a little upset said the witness 
lind said he and the others returned to the laurel canyon house 
and gave holmes a share of their proceeds 
lind said he left town the next day and never again saw launius 
37 or deverell 42 alive they were bludgeoned to death the night 
of july 1 1981 along with linds girlfriend barbara richardson 
22 and another resident of the house joy audrey miller 46 
launius wife susan survived the attack but was never able to 
identify her attacker 
holmes a top pornographic film star of the 1970s died of aids 
last march he reportedly gave deathbed interviews to police who 
were investigating the killings however davidson said his 
statements were not the basis of the new charges 
thorson who was liberaces companion from 1977 to 1982 made 
headlines when he sued the entertainer for 12 million claiming he 
had reneged on a promise to support thorson for the rest of his life 
liberace died of aids in 1987

the government thursday accused five 
firms of helping iraq produce chemical weapons but in a separate 
inquiry cleared another firm of alleged involvement with a suspected 
chemical weapons plant in libya 
officials in bonn including foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher had stated throughout a weeklong investigation of 
imhausenchemie that no evidence had been found to back up us 
claims the firm helped libya build or outfit the libyan plant 
but the governments announcement of its findings involving five 
other firms dealing with iraq may have been intended to show 
washington that bonn takes the issue of chemical weapons seriously 
us officials say the plant at rabta south of the libyan 
capital of tripoli is intended to produce chemical weapons recent 
publicity surrounding washingtons allegations of west german 
involvement have strained relations between the two nato allies 
a senior official of chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democratic party volker ruehe appeared on a nationally televised 
news show late thursday to reject us allegations that bonn ignored 
claims of west german shipments of dangerous chemicals 
we have nothing to hide and we are ready to clear up 
everything ruehe deputy chief of the partys parliamentary 
delegation said on zdf network but what is especially bad is 
that our political will is being doubted 
government spokesman norbert schaefer told a news conference on 
wednesday that bonn officials were not upset by the us charges and 
had investigated them with all seriousness 
the imhausen inquiry has been top news in west germany this week 
even more so following wednesdays us downing of two libyan jets 
over the mediterranean libya and other arab nations have accused 
the united states of provoking the dogfight in anger over the plant 
west german officials have refrained from commenting on the us 
action as well as on the subject of the libyan plant and its 
purposes 
on monday schaefer confirmed that kohl had been informed of 
washingtons suspicion of west german involvement during his visit 
there in november 
official inquiries were made schaefer said although bonn had no 
concrete information to work with at the time such as the names of 
the firms alleged to have been involved 
the finance ministry began its investigation of imhausens export 
records dec 30 when the government first learned the company was 
implicated by us officials schaefer said 
there is no evidence of illegal exports the official in 
charge of the finance ministry investigation freiburg district 
director willi voegele told reporters at the imhausen firm on 
thursday 
juergen hippenstielimhausen managing director of the company 
repeated his denials of the us allegations saying the firm had 
nothing absolutely nothing to do with this libyan tale 
the government made public thursday the text of a dec 20 report 
to parliament on the investigation of similar allegations of illegal 
exports against five west german firms accused of aiding iraq in 
chemical weapons production 
from analysis of the materials shipped to iraq the report 
concluded that in all probability there is evidence that the 
equipment in question can be used in production of materials for 
chemical weapons 
the government said the companies under investigation are water 
engineer trading of hamburg the karl kolb company of dreieich 
pilot plant of dreieich preussag of hanover and heberger bau of 
schifferstadt 
no one answered the telephone at heberger bau on thursday and 
lines to wet of hamburg were constantly busy spokesmen for the 
other three firms denied any wrongdoing 
a spokesman for preussag frederick meyer restated his firms 
position that no wrongdoing had been committed he also questioned 
the governments motives in making public the report amid the furor 
over us allegations that west german firms were involved in the 
construction of a suspected chemical weapons plant in libya

vermont gov madeleine kunin became the first woman governor to 
serve three terms when she took office thursday and a former 
governor in new hampshire collapsed during inaugural activities and 
was hospitalized 
in concord nh former gov john king was reported in guarded 
condition after collapsing hospital during the inauguration of 
republican gov judd gregg 
about an hour after greggs inaugural speech king slumped to 
one side in a chair said mert mann an aide to rep chuck 
douglas king 72 was given oxygen as he was taken from the 
statehouse on a stretcher 
king was governor from 1963 to 1969 and chief justice of the 
state supreme court from 1981 to 1986 
greg kraft a nursing supervisor at concord hospital said king 
was being evaluated by doctors who released no information on his 
ailment 
in vermont kunin 55 asked residents of her state to think 
globally to help quell the threats of nuclear war and environmental 
destruction 
increasingly we find vermonts triumphs and vermonts problems 
linked with those of people around the globe kunin said in her 
inaugural address 
the democratic governor also announced the creation of a 
sixmember panel to strengthen ties with vermonts northern 
neighbor quebec 
kunins address came after she was sworn in to a third twoyear 
term becoming the first woman governor in the nation to serve three 
terms 
two hundred years ago the threats to our existence were easily 
identifiable yorkers to the west and new hampshirites to the east 
todays dangers are more elusive but no less lethal she said 
the greatest threats to life in the 21st century are twofold 
nuclear war and environmental destruction either of which would 
make our planet uninhabitable 
it will require both political will and moral force to achieve 
global agreement that the possibility of nuclear war is obsolete and 
that continued environmental degradation is intolerable kunin 
said

a man convicted of strangling his wife 
during an argument while their daughters watched said thursday he is 
a good parent and is happy an appeals court has given him custody 
of the girls 
im pretty pleased to have the girls back said james lutgen 
34 of east dubuque i dont know what happens next as far as im 
concerned this is over and done with now 
in a decision made public earlier this week the illinois 
appellate court in elgin ruled that lutgen could retain custody of 
his daughters tracy 12 and dana 10 
gene tranel of eldridge iowa the victims brother was shocked 
at the ruling 
its really hard to believe tranel said thursday it sends 
a sad message to society that we live in a day and age where this 
kind of thing can happen 
lutgen said the ruling ends a fouryear nightmare of prison and 
court battles that began the night of dec 21 1984 when an 
argument with his wife carol 26 ended in her death as their 
daughters looked on 
lutgen was charged with two counts of murder but later pleaded 
guilty to voluntary manslaughter prosecutors agreed to the reduced 
charge after a court ruling that the girls were too young to testify 
as witnesses 
i know im a good parent lutgen said thursday adding that 
just because somebody does something wrong doesnt mean he 
should lose custody of his children permanently 
you have to learn to live and forget he said 
the appeals court rejected tranels appeal of a decision by jo 
daviess county judge eric demar of galena on dec 29 1987 giving 
lutgen custody 
other than the tragic circumstances which resulted in the death 
of carol james had an unblemished record the threemember 
appeals panel said in its ruling 
neither our legislature nor our case law in illinois has seen 
fit to set forth a rule that the killing of one parent by the other 
in the presence of the children no matter what the circumstances 
is sufficient to deprive that parent of his or her children on the 
basis of unfitness 
tranel and his wife deb cared for the lutgen girls while lutgen 
was on trial and in prison 
he was released in october 1986 after serving a total 20 months 
of a fouryear minimum sentence he regained custody of his 
daughters 14 months later 
this case is a family tragedy that is over and its best it be 
put to rest said lutgens attorney william schirger of rockford 
he said the girls are not in any danger living with their father 
and noted they told the judge they wanted to live with him 
tranel who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against lutgen 
said he did not know whether he and his wife would appeal to the 
illinois supreme court 
the court system and now even the appellate system has failed 
to protect battered women and innocent victims tranel said it 
appears the courts are not willing to deal with domestic violence

the longstanding flow of retirees from 
the northeast and midwest to the souths balmier climes is on the 
decline says a university of florida professor chronicling the 
trend 
weve come to expect that there will be a continually large 
flow of older people moving from the northeast and midwest states to 
the south thats become part of our conventional wisdom says 
stephen golant a university of florida geography professor but 
thats starting to change 
golant whose study is based on us census data from 1955 to 
1985 says that while the 15state southern region had a net 
migration gain of 280000 elderly people between 197580 the number 
of immigrants declined to 208000 between 198085 
golant author of a place to grow old the meaning of 
environment in old age says one reason for the migration shift is 
that the number of youngold people ages 6574 is declining 
at a faster rate than their oldold counterparts 
the growth rates for the 6574 age group in the northeast and 
midwest which began declining in the mid1980s will continue to 
decline substantially throughout the 1990s and into the first part 
of the 21st century he said this will reduce the pool of 
potential migrants who might relocate to the south 
while the 75plus population will grow at a faster rate than the 
youngold these rates will still be lower than in the 1970s and 
early 1980s 
more importantly the age75 group has consistently been less 
likely to move from state to state or from region to region he 
said 
one consequence of this graying of the population golant said 
is that scarce resources may be taxed even further 
since the oldold will represent an increasingly higher 
proportion of the total elderly population in florida and other 
southern states its likely that there will be an increased need 
for longterm care facilities homecare facilities skilled nursing 
and the like 
he said there may even be some reverse migration from the south 
back to the midwest and northeast 
to the extent that states like florida are not increasing their 
health care and longterm care facilities its reasonable to 
predict that the more dependent and frail elderly population in the 
south will return to their home states where they would be closer 
to their families and to service opportunities he said

the irancontra prosecutor sought dismissal 
thursday of the two major charges against former white house aide 
oliver l north giving up a struggle with the reagan administration 
over disclosure of some of the nations bestkept secrets 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh moved to dismiss conspiracy 
and theft charges citing norths insistence on introducing 
classified information in his defense and the reagan 
administrations refusal to release material the judge ruled north 
would need at trial 
north is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carry 
prison terms totaling as much as 60 years 
these include obstructing various congressional and presidential 
inquiries into the irancontra affair by preparing false statements 
and destroying documents 
us district judge gerhard a gesell scheduled a hearing for 
monday to consider walshs request but the judge is expected to 
dismiss the charges 
president reagan returning to the white house from a california 
vacation said of walshs motion it satisfies our problem which 
has been concern about national security but of course the 
judge has not responded yet were waiting to see what the future is 
going to be 
asked whether he was going to pardon north reagan said were 
waiting for the judicial process to go forward 
the president has repeatedly said he has no plans to pardon his 
former aide but the head of the liberal group people for the 
american way criticized the administrations stance on the 
classified documents and said walshs efforts appear to have been 
sandbagged 
the groups president arthur kropp said the reagan 
administration appears determined to give ollie north a pocket 
pardon as a reward for his irancontra activities 
attorney general dick thornburgh denied such contentions telling 
reporters outside the justice department on the contrary the 
assurance that was given to me by judge walsh was that he had been 
dealt with in good faith that every line of inquiry that he pursued 
he received the fullest cooperation from the executive branch 
walsh had informed thornburgh of his decision to seek dismissal 
at a meeting wednesday 
reagan and vice president bush have been subpoenaed by north to 
testify at the trial but dropping the two major charges could make 
it harder to show why their testimony would be needed perhaps 
defusing a legal issue that has threatened to delay the trial now 
scheduled to begin jan 31 
however defense attorney brendan v sullivan jr said in an 
angrily worded statement that he would continue to seek to use 
classified documents to defend the remaining charges against north 
although the heart of its case is destroyed the independent 
counsel continues to toy with colonel north and apparently refuses 
to recognize that classified information pervades the remaining 
charges as well sullivan said 
in his motion walsh said the conspiracy and theft charges that 
north and three codefendants illegally diverted more than 14 
million in usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
posed the most difficult classified information problems in the 
case 
these counts allege broadreaching activities that include 
norths interaction with a number of intelligence agencies and touch 
upon a number of highly classified covert programs walsh said in 
a brief motion filed with gesell 
efforts to simplify the charges have not eliminated the risk 
that a quantity of classified national security information would be 
compromised by a public trial on the two charges walsh said 
among other allegations the retired marine lieutenant colonel 
and former national security council aide is still charged with 
illegally using a taxexempt foundation to help finance the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras making personal use of at least 
4300 in travelers checks he received from the antisandinista 
movement and accepting an illegal gift in the form of a 14000 
security fence at his suburban virginia home 
but if gesell grants thursdays dismissal motion north would no 
longer be accused of illegally diverting armsforhostage proceeds 
to secretly finance the contras at a time congress had banned such 
aid 
walshs move also suggests that the two major charges could also 
be dismissed later against norths codefendants former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim 
and retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
that would depend however on how much classified information 
might be deemed necessary for their defense efforts poindexters 
access to secret documents when he worked at the white house would 
probably put him in the best position of the three to gain dismissal 
on such grounds 
walshs motion was triggered by gesells refusal to allow more 
censoring of 300 prosecution exhibits to meet administration 
concerns about disclosing in court sensitive information about 
covert intelligence operations 
the prosecutor concluded that the two charges cannot be tried 
in a manner that protects that information 
under the classified information procedures act the court is 
powerless to order disclosure of secret evidence needed in the case 
but the judge can dismiss certain criminal charges if the government 
refuses to make the classified information available for use at a 
public trial 
gesell had said that if the prosecution were to follow through on 
plans to use exhibits covering some 3000 pages of documents it had 
to include verbatim quotations from intelligence reports and 
references to foreign officials by their general importance and 
function the judge also insisted on including references to cia 
officials sources and propriety companies 
north had initially sought to disclose several thousand 
government documents covering extremely sensitive information 
including efforts to locate us hostages in the middle east 
in a tartly worded opinion issued last month gesell accused the 
defense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitive 
information to scuttle the case

a senior official of chancellor helmut 
kohls political party lashed out on national tv on thursday at us 
suggestions that west germany has a habit of ignoring exports of 
dangerous cargo 
volker ruehe vice chairman of the christian democratic partys 
parliamentary delegation rejected the accusations he said were made 
by both us news media and officials 
ruehe was introduced on zdf networks todays journal program 
by moderator peter voss who said the harshest allegations were 
published in the new york times which he described as a 
traditional defender of jewish interests 
ruehe did not comment on or suggest any support for voss 
description of the newspaper 
the new york times on sunday reported from washington that us 
officials suspected the west german firm imhausenchemie of lahr in 
the black forest area of having supplied materials or assistance to 
libya in building what washington believes to be a chemical weapons 
plant 
times columnist william safire later likened bonns claims that 
it found no immediate evidence of wrongdoing to the professed 
ignorance of good germans about adolf hitlers final solution 
to kill all jews 
a university of wisconsin law professor gary milhollin also 
wrote for the times that it should come as no surprise that a west 
german company has been accused of helping libya with the plant 
and said the bonn government has rarely done much to discover or 
stop dangerous exports 
ruehe said at the start of his fiveminute exchange with voss 
we must put all the facts on the table we have nothing to hide 
and we are ready to clear up everything 
but what is especially bad is that our political will is being 
doubted he said west germans strongly favor a worldwide ban on 
chemical weapons and this position is well known to us authorities 
we are an important allied partner ruehe said adding that 
trust among the nato allies is a basic 
he said he planned a trip to washington next week to meet members 
of congress to learn what information they have in the libyan case 
and clear up any questions 
bonn on thursday announced it had found no evidence that 
imhausenchemie helped build or outfit the libyan plant in question

the israelibacked christian militia on 
thursday expelled 31 lebanese from the strip of land used by israel 
as a buffer zone with lebanon police said 
the south lebanon army expelled the lebanese for disrupting 
security and for being members of the prosoviet lebanese 
communist party a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
israel has reported a rash of attempted infiltrations into israel 
from lebanon by palestinian terrorists israel and the south lebanon 
army patrol the israelidesignated security zone in south 
lebanon at the israeli border 
police said those expelled included najat bishara the mother of 
a woman who allegedly shot and wounded gen antoine lahd commander 
of the south lebanon army at his residence in the southern town of 
marjayoun on nov8 
lahds reputed assailant souha bishara 21 is a member of the 
lebanese communist party 
the police spokesman said the expulsions included seven families 
from the villages of kfar hamam ibl elsaki and deir mimas in the 
sixto10milewide zone 
israel set up the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of its 
occupation army from south lebanon in the summer of 1985 to curb 
crossborder guerrilla raids 
mrs bishara talking to reporters in the southern port of sidon 
said christian militiamen came to my house in deir mimas at 5 am 
and told me that ill have to leave the village 
she said she was driven in a jeep to the village of kfar tibnit 
on the northern edge of the security zone where she joined the 
other deportees 
the group walked to the nearby market town of nabatiyeh where 
moslem militiamen provided them with transport she said 
in another development the syrianbacked shiite moslem amal 
militia said thursday it has banned using its sovietmade katyusha 
rockets against israel or in the security zone 
such action is incompatible with amals strategy in its 
struggle with the occupier israel said an amal statement issued 
in this southern lebanon port city 
the mainstream amal arabic for hope which is at loggerheads 
with the fundamentalist proiranian hezbollah or party of god has 
long tried to shield the predominantly shiite population of south 
lebanon from israeli reprisals for katyusha attacks 
firing katyushas from liberated areas into occupied land is 
totally forbidden the amal statement said 
the ban followed an israeli air raid earlier thursday on an amal 
command post in south lebanon in which eight amal militiamen were 
wounded 
the israeli army command said the post was used the day before 
the attack by syrianbacked palestinian guerrillas in an abortive 
raid on northern israel it said all three guerrillas were killed by 
israeli troops

a soviet official said in an interview published 
thursday that his countrys jamming of western radio broadcasts was 
dangerous because of high levels of electromagnetic radiation it 
produced 
it apparently was the first time a soviet official made such an 
admission about the jamming which went on for years before 
gradually being phased out over the past several years 
deputy communications minister gennady kudryavtsev noted the 
soviets last fall stopped jamming the us radio liberty west 
germanys deutch welle and the voice of israel 
the jamming stations were usually placed in the center of town 
the electromagnetic radiation in adjacent areas exceeded the safety 
norms kudryavtsev said in an interview carried by the tass news 
agency 
he did not say what the levels were or explain the effects of 
prolonged exposure to high levels 
we will dismantle the outdated jamming stations and use the 
modern stations for broadcasting local republic and regional 
programs he said 
he said the power of the stations will be lowered therefore 
lowering the electromagnetic emissions 
if at lower output they still exceed safety norms they will be 
closed he said 
the soviet union for years jammed broadcasts by stations such as 
the british broadcasting corp voice of america radio liberty and 
other western broadcasters jamming of voice of america broadcasts 
in russian and other languages of the soviet union was halted in may 
1987

ago three films three men and a baby fatal attraction 
and beverly hills cop ii all collected more than 150 million 
krier warned moviemakers could face problems in 1989 from 
overscreening too many theaters built too close together 
during a recent boom in movie house construction 
that can result in shorter play times for movies in invividual 
theaters meaning more product is needed he said 
meanwhile the holiday film season was down more than 5 million 
from a year ago grosses from nov 29 to this wednesday were 564 
million off from 5698 million during the corresponding weeks in 
1987 the last two weeks of 1988 with revenues of 2216 million

an israeli man was killed in the west bank and 
jewish settlers tried to raid nearby arab villages in revenge about 
midnight thursday but troops ejected them and blocked roads into 
arab areas israel radio said 
earlier thursday 17 palestinians were reported wounded by army 
gunfire in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and west bank 
residents said an arab slain by gunmen was suspected of 
collaborating with israel 
in bethlehem soldiers ordered residents to paint over graffiti 
threatening death to elias freij mayor of the west bank city the 
slogans appeared after freij proposed a truce in the palestinian 
uprising 
the israeli civilians body was found thursday night by the road 
leading into the jewish settlement of yakir and it appeared he had 
been shot a military spokeswoman said 
the spokeswoman who under regulations was not identified said 
the army and police were investigating all possibilities and had not 
ruled out a guerrilla attack israel radio said the man had a 
criminal past 
the man was a resident of the tel aviv suburb of petah tikva he 
was apparently shot as he waited for a ride at an isolated 
crossroads leading from a main road into yakir 24 miles north of 
jerusalem the time of the shooting was not known 
the army closed off surrounding areas and searched for suspects 
the spokeswoman said army radio said troops imposed curfews on two 
nearby arab villages kifl harith and dir istiya 
if the man were killed as part of the 13month palestinian 
uprising he would be the 15th israeli fatality at least 347 
palestinians have been killed 
residents of ariel a neighboring jewish settlement took to the 
streets at around midnight army radio said they tried to block a 
main road and threw rocks at arab cars in anger over the killing 
the radio said 
israels state radio said troops ousted settlers who entered an 
arab village and smashed windshields of cars 
thursdays shooting injuries occurred during two clashes in the 
west bank and during rioting in the shati refugee camp in gaza city

barahmehs activities 
in bethlehem soldiers rounded up youths and some shopkeepers and 
ordered them to paint over slogans threatening freij one of the 
west banks bestknown moderates

to stop the revolt exposes himself to the bullets of our people 
arafat made the comment during a rally jan 1 marking the

threatening statement he denied reports he had been in hiding 
the slogans signed by the radical plo faction popular front for 
the liberation of palestine included shame on all the traitors 
and the fate of freij will not be better than that of zafer al

masri the projordanian mayor of nablus was slain in 1986 after 
indications he might play a role in the peace process with israel 
in a telephone call to the associated press freij called the 
threats absolutely meaningless

opening universities it closed nearly a year ago the plo rejected 
the idea and israel made no formal response

warriors had been watching him it said

solidarity leader lech walesa played down a 
split in the independent labor movement on thursday after a longtime 
rival appeared uninivited at a news conference to press his 
differences 
andrzej gwiazda showed up at the walesa news conference with a 
copy of a statement from the working group of the national 
commission a hardline splinter group seeking less conciliation 
with the government 
according to a witness walesa appeared agitated when presented 
with the groups document at his weekly news conference in gdansk 
but did not address gwiazda directly 
what is happening now in solidarity and some people call it a 
split seems to me to be harmful to solidarity but it is not really 
dangerous and is only marginal walesa told reporters i will 
tolerate it as long as it does not pose a danger to poland and to 
the union 
today we are fighting for implementation of pluralism in 
poland later after winning pluralism all those groups will have a 
place for themselves but they should not disturb us in regaining 
legal status for solidarity in reforms and in the struggle to 
achieve one thing pluralism for all 
solidarity which walesa founded in 1980 is the soviet blocs 
first independent labor movement 
gwiazda was an early colleage of walesa but split with him and 
unsuccessfully sought the unions top post before the governments 
1981 crackdown on the union when martial law was declared 
the splinter groups name refers to the solidarity national 
commission which last met in 1981 it was a nationwide elected 
assembly of local union representatives 
gwiazda organized the group at a dec 18 meeting in gdansk with 
40 people including 16 former commission members it advocates that 
solidarity become more confrontational 
the group passed a resolution urging that the 200plus commission 
members be reassembled a step that walesa has dismissed as 
unrealistic because many of them have emigrated or drifted away from 
solidarity 
solidarity is now governed by a national executive commission of 
about 20 members called together by walesa and representing regions 
each region has its own executive commission 
gwiazda could not immediately be reached for comment and no one 
answered the phone at his home but gdansk solidarity activist 
joanna wojciechowicz read a portion of a statement coauthored by 
gwiazda that was among the papers given to walesa 
the statement says solidarity is in danger of adopting a policy 
of reconciliation that inhibits its ability to fight for workers 
and that some solidarity activists are becoming private business 
owners hostile to unions 
solidarity has become split into activists who trust lech 
walesa and those who remain faithful to solidarity the 
statement said 
we are of the opinion that it is necessary for the good of the 
working people and solidaritys credibility to concentrate all 
forces in defense of the economic interests of employees we propose 
a fight for maximum levels of pay increase wherever possible the 
statement said 
government spokesman jerzy urban and the official pap news agency 
have called attention to the split 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski last month asked the 
communist party central committee to reconsider the partys stance 
toward solidarity and said walesa was a reliable partner for talks 
the committee members are to meet this month and give a response

nearly 600 state prison inmates were 
given their freedom just early thursday under pressure from the 
federal courts to ease overcrowding in louisianas lockups 
most inmates appeared happy to be free but some complained about 
the way they were released and about the midnight hour 
robert dennis hage a convicted rapist said he was taken to a 
baton rouge greyhound terminal after getting 20 by the corrections 
department 
there was no organization in all of this said hage you 
get 20 and they say theres the door ive already spent 5 here 
for a skimpy breakfast 
he was in the first contingent of 900 to be released this month 
under an updated law that allows early freedom for inmates with good 
behavior records 
the law is one of the few approved by a reluctant legislature to 
ease overcrowding in a system that has more than 12000 people in 
nine institutions with 4000 held temporarily in parish jails 
awaiting space in state lockups 
limits were placed on each state prison by the federal courts in 
1975 by 1982 every lockup in louisiana incuding 178 local jails 
was under federal court order that prohibited overcrowding and 
required better living conditions 
under the law prisoners who have served half their sentences are 
eligible for early release for good time or exemplary behavior 
wardens and other penal officials make the final decision on who is 
released early 
the early release law initially was passed in 1986 but it only 
affected inmates held in stateoperated prisons that law was 
amended in 1988 to cover all state prisoners regardless of where 
they were held 
red tape and paperwork delayed the first early releases under the 
law until thursday prison officials said 
the gates were opened for the inmates at 1201 am and those 
with no family waiting were taken to the greyhound terminal in baton 
rouge 
martha jumonville spokeswoman for the department of corrections 
said that the official release date was jan 5 which means 1201 
am

the cabinet on thursday approved budget cuts 
that will slash 67 million from defense allocations as part of an 
economic austerity program designed to cut inflation and promote 
growth israel radio said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin resisted the move which comes as 
the army tries to put down a 13monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
communications minister gad yakobi who was on a special cabinet 
committee that hammered out the compromise told israel television 
i think this is a fair compromise despite the economic crisis it 
does the maximum not to affect the armys degree of preparedness 
the military cutback is part of 611 million in spending cuts 
proposed for education health and other government services 
the vote was 18to2 the radio said with education minister 
yitzhak navon and industry minister ariel sharon opposed 
it said navon strongly opposed cuts in school spending and 
sharon felt the overall budget plan does not allocate enough money 
for new jewish settlements in the occupied territories or for 
collective farms 
finance minister shimon peres said the goal is to hold the 
deficit in the new budget year beginning april 1 to the same level 
as in the current year this years budget deficit is projected at 
about 722 million 
the government has not yet released figures on what actual 
spending for the new fiscal year will be the current budget totals 
29 billion 
peres who assumed office with the new cabinet in december began 
his austerity program last week by devaluing the shekel 5 percent 
against the dollar on sunday he announced a further devaluation of 
8 percent 
the shekel was adjusted to boost israels flagging exports and to 
stop a run on the dollar that was draining the nations foreign 
currency reserves 
peres also announced a sharp cut in government subsidies on such 
basics as milk chicken and public transport to keep this years 
deficit under control 
he has proposed revenueraising measures that include higher 
taxes on new and luxury cars larger health insurance payments new 
fees at medical clinics registration fees for high school students 
and higher tuitions at universities 
peres initially hoped to cut as much as 166 million from 
defense but ran into strong resistance from rabin 
rabin told israel radio he was agreeing to the cut because he 
couldnt ignore israels economic difficulties but he said his 
ministry would have to shift funds from other military programs to 
face the high cost of handling the palestinian insurrection 
a defense ministry official said on condition of anonymity that 
the estimated cost of handling the uprising from the time it started 
in december 1987 through next march was 222 million 
police minister bar lev said 200 officers will lose their jobs 
because of the 33 million reduction in his budget and pledged to 
keep his officers focused on security duties israel radio said 
navon objected strongly to the proposal that the government 
introduce high school registration fees ranging from 100 to 800 
shekels 55 to 440 a year 
such fees he told israel radio will lead to dropouts 
peres has set an inflation target of 9 percent by the end of 
1989 about half the current rate he also hopes to stimulate 
greater economic growth in israel the nations gross national 
product grew just 1 percent this past year

emperor hirohitos blood pressure plunged 
dangerously and failed to recover thursday despite two emergency 
transfusions indicating a sharp decline in his already frail 
health palace officials said 
early friday hirohitos breathing rate jumped dramatically to 32 
breaths a minute from his normal rate of 20 to 22 breaths due to his 
weakened condition said ken maeda spokesman for the imperial 
palace 
but he said the 87yearold monarch was clearly conscious and 
that his latest vital signs did not present an immediate crisis 
hirohito was given 172 pints of blood thursday in two 
transfusions after his systolic blood pressure fell below 70 but it 
rose only to 74 by evening maeda said 
such low levels can permanently damage the kidneys brain and 
other internal organs because of the reduced amount of oxygen 
flowing to them the average person has a systolic blood pressure of 
120 
sources close to the palace physicians said the level of waste 
products in hirohitos blood has reached dangerous levels because of 
kidney damage kyodo news service reported 
in the past transfusions have raised the emperors blood 
pressure in a relatively brief period of time but the recovery time 
lengthened as hirohitos strength waned during more than 3 months 
of intermittent internal bleeding 
the low blood pressure indicates hirohito continues to lose blood 
internally although no discharges were reported thursday the 
lost blood may still be in his body a palace official said on 
condition of anonymity 
doctors fear the emperor is weakening and are focusing their 
efforts on lifting his blood pressure the official said 
previously doctors concentrated on averting massive blood loss but 
now the emperor might not have enough energy to discharge a large 
amount of blood he added 
transfusions have been a major treatment since the emperors 
contidion worsened sept 19 when he vomited a substantial amount 
by thursday evening he had received 678 pints of blood 
palace officials have refused to comment on news reports that the 
emperor is suffering from cancer in his upper intestine or pancreas 
crown prince akihito 55 the emperors elder son is heir to the 
throne hirohito the longest reigning living monarch marked the 
beginning of his 63rd year as emperor on dec 25 the anniversary of 
the death of his father emperor taisho 
under the postworld war ii constitution japans emperor holds

a navy cockpit tape of this weeks 
confrontation between us and libyan jet fighters offers only 
flashes of video images but provides in audio the drama of american 
aviators being unexpectedly caught up in combat 
the tape released late thursday at the pentagon also supports 
the assertions of administration officials that the two navy f14s 
repeatedly tried to maneuver away from two chasing libyan mig 
fighters the pilot of the lead f14 can be heard counting each time 
he tries to head away only to have the bogies jink back into us 
although the quality is not good the tape concludes with a 
dramatic rush of pictures at the end of the dogfight when the last 
libyan mig is suddenly within visual range 
the tape shows the lead f14 struggling to line up in a firing 
position behind the mig23 finally succeeding in getting a tone 
alert for his sidewinder missile that allows him to fire 
pentagon officials after unveiling the cockpit tape announced 
they were also releasing a still picture taken from the video tape 
to prove the libyan mig23 flogger jets were armed libya had 
claimed on wednesday after the confrontation the united states shot 
down two unarmed reconnaissance jets 
the audio portion of the cockpit tape is about 7 minutes in 
length while the video portion is less than 30 seconds the audio 
portion shows that early on in the confrontation the american 
aviators became concerned about the libyans intent 
after the second attempt to maneuver away from the mig23s the 
f14s go to a warning yellow weapons hold status that is an 
intermediate stage in the process of preparing to fire in self 
defense 
shortly thereafter the americans again try to maneuver away 
bogies have jinked back into me now for the third time noses 
on at 35 miles angels 7 the lead pilot reports 
angels 7 means the planes altitude is 7000 feet 
at 27 miles apart the f14s try again and again their 
maneuvers are matched by the libyans 
then after a fifth evasive maneuver bogies have jinked back at 
me again for the fifth time theyre on my nose now inside of 20 
miles 
at this point the lead aircraft commander decides to defend 
himself 
master arm on he says master arm on centering up the t 
bogies have jinked back into me again sixteen miles centering the 
dot 
the phrases centering up the t and centering the dot 
refer to the use of a cockpit steering cue to ensure an optimum 
missile launch position when ready the pilot calls out fox 1 
when he fires a sparrow missile and fox 2 when he fires a 
sidewinder 
fourteen miles fox 1 fox 1 
at this point the backseat radar weapons officer can be heard 
saying aw jesus 
ten miles hes back on my nose fox 1 again the pilot calls 
out 
six miles six miles 
then another voice again apparently the backseat weapons 
officer can be heard saying tally two tally two meaning the 
two libyans have just come into visual sight 
the pilot of the f14 then says five miles four miles 
the second f14 flying as wingman then fires a sparrow and the 
weapons officer in the lead f14 reports to his pilot okay hes 
got a missile off 
at this point it becomes almost impossible to determine who is 
talking at each point but the tape continues

at this point the lead f14 finally succeeds in manuevering 
behind the jinking mig and gets his missile tone firing the 
sidewinder 
good kill good kill 
good kill 
pilot ejected 
okay lets head north head north 
lets go down low on the deck unload 500 knots lets get 
out of here 
were showing two good chutes in the air here 
then in a report back to the carrier roger two floggers two 
floggers splashed were heading north 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said no effort was made by the 
americans to communicate by radio with the libyans the f14s did 
not have compatible radio equipment and the e2c radar sentry plane 
that was also airborne did not try there was not enough time to 
make such an attempt and such tries at radio communication are not 
standard procedure when dealing with libya

the 29yearold former president of a wall street 
securities firm will plead guilty to manipulating stock that climbed 
in value while others tumbled in the crash of october 1987 federal 
prosecutors said thursday 
stanley aslanian jr former president of haas securities corp 
also will cooperate with an investigation by the securities and 
exchange commission the fbi and the us attorneys office in 
manhattan into his firms activities 
us attorney rudolph giuliani said he hoped aslanians plea 
bargain would encourage others allegedly involved in securities 
fraud to do the same 
an fbi spokesman said 20 agents are assigned to investigate stock 
manipulation probing and unidentified persons entities and deals 
giuliani said the investigation will be about past activities not 
current ones 
aslanian would plead guilty friday in us district court in 
manhattan to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud by 
manipulating stock giuliani said 
under court procedure aslanian pleaded innocent before a us 
magistrate thursday and waived his right to require the government 
to present his case to a grand jury for possible indictment said 
assistant us attorney peter lieb 
aslanian faces up to five years in prison and 250000 in fines 
according to the information filed by the government haas 
securities went out of business oct 28 1987 after aslanian was 
involved in manipulating stocks 
haas securities was a 75yearold firm with 12000 customers and 
four offices across the nation officials said giuliani said the 
company employed more than 100 people 
one way haas securities manipulated stock was to enter inflated 
prices into the national association of securities dealers automated 
quotations computer network lieb said 
kalman gallop aslanians attorney said haas securities is in 
chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in us bankruptcy court in 
manhattan 
millions and millions of dollars were involved but profits 
could not be easily determined gallop said aslanian declined to 
comment 
the securities stock rode out even rose above the stock market 
crash of oct 19 1987 before it came tumbling down gallop said 
they held up remarkably for a day or two and some went up after 
the 19th they had an erratic behavior gallop said 
then the company faltered and the investigation began once haas 
went out of business nine days after the crash lieb said gallop 
acknowledged there were customer complaints 
we have seen a proliferation of these kinds of activities since 
the crash james c esposito an assistant deputy director of the 
fbi said at the news conference 
lieb said this is a new case involving the manipulation of four 
stocks ts industries from the salt lake city area bigo tires 
flores de new mexico in new mexico and cliff engle ltd of new 
jersey 
the information alleges that the scheme lasted from june 1985 
until november 1987 
the information further charges that aslanian and his 
coconspirators employed a variety of fraudulent and manipulative 
devices to raise maintain and control the price of the manipulated 
securities giuliani said 
the methods included concealing certain coconspirators 
controlled the public markets for the maniulated stocks 
publishing false information about the companies and selling stock 
without authorization to retail customers who did have the money to 
pay for the stock giuliani said 
the coconspirators also would discourage and at times refuse 
to accept sell orders from customers according to the information

two sikhs were hanged friday for the 1984 
assassination of prime minister indira gandhi whose death triggered 
a wave of separatist violence that continues to plague the nation 
kehar singh and satwant singh were pronounced dead at 815 am 
945 pm est less than half an hour after they were taken from 
their tiny cells on death row and marched to the chilly rainsoaked 
gallows at new delhis tihar central jail said a police official 
who received confirmation from the prison 
two panels of five supreme court justices on thursday each turned 
down lastminute appeals by satwant singh the only assassin who 
survived and kehar singh convicted of helping plot the murder 
the executions capped four years of legal maneuvering that began 
after mrs gandhi was gunned down on oct 31 1984 apparently in 
revenge for an army raid she ordered on the golden temple the 
holiest sikh shrine 
hours before the executions human rights activists and 
opposition politicians appealed to prime minister rajiv gandhi to 
spare the lives of the men convicted in her mothers death there 
was no response 
satwant singh a 30yearold former bodyguard of mrs gandhi and 
kehar singh a 54yearold former government clerk are not related 
like all sikhs they take the singh name which means lion 
shortly before 8 am the two men were taken from their 8foot 
by 8foot prison cells with their hands tied behind their backs and 
their legs bound with iron chains they were escorted by guards to 
the scaffold in the open courtyard 25 steps away 
caps were put on their heads and inchthick ropes placed around 
their necks with the signal from prison superintendent jaidev 
ssarangi the two hangmen pulled the bolts that released the 
trapdoors 
satwant singh and kehar singh spent their final hours visiting 
with relatives and lawyers 
hes happy and laughing said jasbi kaur kehar singhs wife 
after a 50minute meeting with her husband he told me to take 
care of the family 
satwant singhs lawyer rs sodhi described his client as 
very very composed and then read a handwritten statement from 
his client 
there is no greater privilege for a sikh to lay down his life 
for the protection of the sikh faith the statement said i wish 
i could be born again and again and each time lay down my life for 
this 
fearing the executions could trigger a new outbreak of communal 
violence heavilyarmed security forces were placed on maximum alert 
in the capital and the northern states of haryana himachal pradesh 
and punjab where sikh militants have been waging a bloody 
6yearold campaign for independence 
police were posted at bus and rail stations often targets of 
sikh extremists many schools were ordered closed as a precaution 
preparations for the executions were completed last october after 
the blackrimmed death warrants were signed 
defense lawyers had filed several appeals this week in a third 
attempt to block the executions all were rejected 
satwant singhs appeal sought prosecution of two of mrs gandhis 
security guards he claimed the guards shot him after he was 
disarmed and said their actions amounted to attempted murder 
he did not appeal for clemency but under indian law his death 
sentence was delayed automatically as kehar singh appealed 
a third sikh balbir singh also had been arrested tried and 
convicted on conspiracy charges and sentenced to death in the 
assassination but the supreme court overturned the conviction in 
august for lack of evidence 
more than 1200 people were killed most of them sikhs in the 
raid to rout sikh militants from the golden temple in amritsar four 
months before mrs gandhi was killed 
as mrs gandhi lay dying a guard named beant singh threw down 
his gun and shouted i have done what i had to do now you do 
what you must do 
other guards opened fire killing beant singh and wounding 
satwant singh beant singh is revered as a matryr by many sikh 
militants 
kehar singh a government clerk who was beants uncle was 
arrested a month later and charged with helping plot the 
assassination which caused antisikh riots in northern india by 
members of the hindu majority more than 2700 people were killed 
nearly all of them sikhs 
sikh violence has increased since and at least 2440 people were 
killed last year in punjab the only indian state in which sikhs are 
the majority that was more than double the 1032 victims in 1987 
sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation in 
punjab they claim discrimination by hindus who make up more than 
80 percent of indias 880 million people

important muscle protein says a study that may help explain why 
muscular dystrophy causes mental impairment in some people 
scientists have been puzzled about why duchenne muscular 
dystrophy the most common and severe form of the disease leads to 
mental trouble in some but not all of its victims 
duchenne is caused by defects in the gene that tells muscle cells 
how to make a protein called dystrophin the defects can prevent 
dystrophin production leading to progressive weakness and wasting 
of voluntary muscles 
onethird to onehalf of duchenne patients also suffer mild to 
moderate mental impairment according to the muscular dystrophy 
association

radon detectors are becoming popular items in 
hardware stores but a consumer group says theyre only as good as 
the laboratory that analyzes them and too often thats not any 
good at all 
the group public citizen maintained wednesday that nearly half 
of the 34 radon testing laboratories it evaluated had quality 
control problems the group sent test samples to seven of the 
largest labs and found dramatically false results in come cases 
while millions of americans are testing their homes for radon 
gas some may be using doityourself kits that provide dangerously 
misleading results joan claybrook president of public citizen 
told a news conference 
ms claybrook said public citizen purchased test kits and sent 
them in for analysis at the seven laboratories after filling them 
with radoncontaminated air obtained at two energy department 
laboratories the results at three of the labs were wide of the mark 
by 67 percent in one case

even though this town is full of empty promises 
the failure of the independent film distributors is particularly 
painful 
the independents recently heralded as the creative salvation 
from hollywoods major studios have been unspooling reels of 
heretodaygonetomorrow clunkers messenger of death 
freeway illegally yours straight to hell and 
kansas among the most anemic failures 
just as audiences are avoiding these titles those responsible 
are trying to dodge financial ruin the de laurentis entertainment 
group is in bankruptcy proceedings as is filmdallas inc the cannon 
group lost close to 100 million last year debtheavy new world 
entertainment dropped more than 28 million in the second quarter of 
1988 
while a few independents such as orion classics prosper with a 
slate of fanciful films such as the new women on the verge of a 
nervous breakdown many companies including oncecelebrated 
island pictures are laying off employees cutting production or 
ignoring bills in desperate attempts to balance books in a tougher 
movie market 
a lot of people have been burned said robert shaye 
president and chief executive officer of independent new line cinema 
corp which has the nightmare on elm street franchise to keep 
its head above water 
shipping to theaters typically lowbudget movies they made or 
purchased the independents once had a future as bright as a klieg 
light though lacking the huge production and marketing divisions of 
the studios these smaller outfits shamed hollywoods power players 
with inventive and wellreceived projects 
they succeeded by giving film makers what they most covet 
freedom i think the independents offer more tender loving care 
thats basically what it takes to release a movie well director 
tony bill said recently 
and such concessions occassionally paid off cinecoms romantic 
a room with a view was a 16 million critical hit in 1986 
islands shes gotta have it directed by spike lee was a 
success that same year and us fans flocked to skouras pictures 
1987 release of the swedish film my life as a dog 
little did the independents know that real dog years were at hand 
the home video market once able to make even the worst linda 
blair prison film profitable changed into a business where only 
quality movies would be rented 
overextended by a release schedule of 385 films up 100 percent 
from 1985 the independents were suddenly stuck with crates of 
deadonarrival features 
there was a period of time when everybody thought that you 
couldnt make an unprofitable movie said shaye even if you 
screwed up you could still make a profit in video no longer and 
things got worse 
as advertising costs soared the major film companies disney 
universal united artists warner bros and their pals introduced 
both schlocky thrillers such as they live and childs play 
and the stylish personal films like crossing delancey and the 
good mother once reserved for independents unlike typical studio 
movies aiming for the broadest possible audience these films 
adapted the independents fondness for the highbrow 
all of a sudden the majors are catering to the adult 
audience said ira deutchman president of marketing and 
distribution for cinecom with nowhere else to turn some 
independents chose to match the studios with 
lowestcommondenominator washouts 
the results in many cases have been disastrous all those 
companies attempted to compete with the studios and they had their 
hats handed to them on a platter said thomas coleman the former 
chairman of atlantic entertainment group 
coleman should know soon after he made those remarks the 
financially strapped atlantic was bought by kvc video for an 
undisclosed sum and coleman would no longer head the company 
skouras for one failed in its recent releases in a shallow 
grave and waiting for the moon 
those films were so ambitious in their scopes and budgets that 
i think they probably should have been catered towards a major 
studio said jeff lipsky president of skouras motion picture 
division which wont release another film until next march 
the most profitable independent films have been of the 
nobudget variety everybodys risks are low and the media loves to 
discover new talent they love to be shocked lipsky said 
but the only surprise recently was how undistinguished the 
independent films came to be cineplex odeons high hopes for the 
glass menagerie were shattered by poor ticket sales cinecoms 
farm movie miles from home suffered from boxoffice drought 
vestrons waxwork melted 
the major studios have bombs too but for the independents 
teetering on a much narrower tightrope consecutive flops can spell 
sudden trouble stung by the crash of patty hearst atlantic can 
scarcely afford another flop with 1969 
a lot of the smaller companies are really scrambling said 
william quigley president of vestron pictures buoyed by its 
dirty dancing riches amid several less successful releases 
alive films makers of the rakish hit the moderns is 
turning to horror movies for resuscitation vestron atlantic and 
the samuel goldwyn company are now pursuing midpriced dramas and 
comedies with known actors aimed at a broad audience you have to 
find pockets of opportunity said atlantics coleman 
it doesnt make sense anymore to go out and buy a marginal art 
film from a country in scandinavia said steve rothenberg 
goldwyns vice president of theatrical distribution 
where were heading is making commercial films like mystic 
pizza that cost between 3 million and 7 million he said so 
far its working mystic pizza a romantic comedy is doing 
brisk business 
said vestrons quigley for 7 million we can do pictures that 
look like studio pictures and at least in the case of dirty 
dancing succeed about as well as any studio picture out there 
vestrons ambitious lineup includes more than 20 films in coming 
months 
skouras and orion classics the latter riding on a wave of 
accomplished artfilm hits is following a different and perhaps 
less risky course you have to look for subject matter that 
the majors wouldnt touch with a 10foot pole said skouras 
lipsky 
orion classics with a knack for spotting small gems from a 
distance has made a killing with wings of desire purchased for 
around 200000 and already yielding 3 million in ticket sales the 
company will open the acclaimed spanish movie women on the verge 
of a nervous breakdown later this month 
but if independents continue to produce marginal films of any 
budget or from any country the shakeup is likely to continue 
nobody it seems is dying to spend six bucks on movies with names 
like vestrons chud ii

the arts amp entertainment network begins tonight 
an ambitious 26part series on ussoviet relations the eagle 
and the bear produced with help from abc news 
freelance producers working for aampe actually put together the 
series but it is a cooperative venture between aampe and cap 
citiesabc video enterprises inc and the executive producer is abc 
news av westin the footage comes from the abc news and pathe film 
archives 
the series of halfhour episodes airing weekly on fridays 
covers 40 years of ussoviet history from world war ii to 
glasnost it is part of a burgeoning repertoire of documentaries and 
series the twentieth century the vietnam war with walter 
cronkite world war i biography and profiles for 
example that are making aampe a favorite of history buffs 
sophisticated students of ussoviet relations might not find 
much new information in the eagle and the bear if the first 
episodes are any indication but the footage is fascinating and the 
series wellwritten it is interspersed with interviews with 
statesmen and historians 
tonights opening episode dateline 1943 europe explains 
the basis for the mistrust inherent in the soviet unions 
international relations the countrys massive losses in world war 
ii in the battle for stalingrad alone says the narration more 
russians were killed than all the americans lost during the entire 
war 
in the midst of the war began the personal diplomacy between 
franklin roosevelt and josef stalin whose apparently amiable 
relationship seems not unlike that between president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev fdr found in the soviet dictator a 
stalwart good humor and yet a slide in ussoviet relations 
followed 
i believe that we are going to get along with him stalin and 
the russian people very very well roosevelt predicted in an 
overly optimistic speech to congress 
there is also a lively description of the later meeting between 
stalin and harry s truman at potsdam with the nazis defeated 
truman was ready to get tough on the communists and told stalin 
that the united states had test detonated an atom bomb historians 
recall accounts that stalin simply didnt react to the information 
he either didnt understand what truman was talking about or he 
already knew about the atom bomb test 
despite trumans gettough attitude he left potsdam without 
changing the eastern european boundaries that existed when roosevelt 
attended the summit at yalta 
by the end of the episode the united states has dropped atomic 
bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and the united states and russia 
participate as allies for the last time at the signing of japans 
surrender 
the cold war begins setting the stage for episode two 
dateline 1945 korea airing jan 13 
later episodes do not necessarily follow linear history episode 
three is set in 1961 and is about the building of the berlin wall 
and the following episode jumps ahead to 1983 and the invasion of 
grenada 
later installments have more on korea and berlin plus the cuban 
missile crisis the arms race the rise of solidarity in poland and 
the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
aampe has 15 episodes ready for air the last 11 are in production 
aampe and cap citiesabc video enterprises inc are collaborating on 
another series heroes

one of the agriculture departments most 
important economic surveys will get under way next month as 
interviewers begin asking 26000 farmers and ranchers what kind of 
year they had in 1988 
economist jim johnson says the fifth annual farm costs and 
returns survey scheduled for feb 13 to march 31 will provide the 
first hard answers to a number of questions relating to the 1988 
drought 
the information also will provide an important backdrop as 
congress begins work on farm policy and legislation to replace the 
1985 farm law which will expire in 1990 
lawmakers will seek a multitude of answers to economic questions 
as they begin hearing proposals for replacing or modifying the 1985 
law they will want to know how the current act performed during its 
fiveyear lifespan 
the annual usda survey scheduled in february and march is a 
statistical measurement of the farm economys health and is provided 
by farmers themselves 
one of the most important goals will be to determine how the 
drought in 1988 affected the farm financial recovery that was 
evident in 1987 income and debt levels in different sectors of 
agriculture and in various parts of the country will be examined 
what was the impact of the governments drought assistance 
program did farmers alter production practices because of drought 
without this annual survey wed be out of touch and out of 
date johnson said wed have to rely on old information and 
educated guesses wed be treating agriculture in all its 
diversity as if it were one big farm because we wouldnt have the 
data to look beneath the aggregate numbers 
the voluntary confidential survey is managed by the departments 
national agricultural statistics service or nass and its state 
offices another agency the economic research service analyzes the 
information and presents its findings in reports 
farmers and ranchers were selected for the survey to represent a 
broad crosssection of us agriculture and will be contacted by 
local interviewers or enumerators 
doug kleweno of nass said that each interview may require around 
an hour and a half on the average although it depends greatly on 
the size of the farming operation and whether it is a single 
enterprise or involves several types of operations such as cash 
grain livestock and dairying 
the first results of this years survey will be issued july 5 and 
will analyze 1988 farm production expenses kleweno said more 
reports including those showing drought impact and other 
information will be issued later 
last years survey conducted just before the 1988 drought hit 
included substantial evidence that american farmers were well on the 
road to recovery after the heavy burdens of debt declining land 
values and high interest rates of the early 1980s 
overall 1987 was probably the best year for the farm sector in 
this decade says economist mitch morehart in the january issue of 
farmline magazine that wasnt true for all farm types and all 
regions of the country and some farmers were still struggling to 
stay afloat as 1988 began 
morehart added also we can assume that at least part of the 
general recovery in 1987 reflects the fact that some o the most 
severely stressed farmers had already left agriculture 
according to the report 1987 brought a modest upturn in farm 
receipts a 42 percent increase in federal farm program payments 
generally stable production expenses and recordhigh farm income 
further it said after declining for six straight years the 
us farm sectors equity or net worth rose 6 percent to an 
estimated 566 billion spurred by higher land values and continued 
reductions in debt 
of the 22 million us farms an estimated 101000 were rated 
as vulnerable to failure the report said they ended 1987 
with a troubling combination of high debts and negative net farm 
incomes their numbers however were down from more than 200000 in 
1986 
the survey showed that 1987s improvement was greatest in terms 
of debt reduction on the average farm debt averaged 15 percent of 
farm assets in 1987 down from 22 percent in 1986 
about 44 percent of the farms ended 1987 without any outstanding 
debt compared with 40 percent in the two previous years generally 
the nodebt farms were smaller operations but debt reductions also 
occurred at all levels the report said 
but the distinction of having no debts is probably not the most 
important one because debt financing is a common practice in 
commercial farming the report said 
instead economists try to distinguish between lowdebt farms in 
which debts comprise 40 percent or less of a farms assets and 
highdebt operations having debts equal to more than 40 percent of 
assets 
last years survey showed that in 1987 lowdebt farms including 
those without any debts accounted for 85 percent of all farms up 
from 79 percent in 1986 the remaining 15 percent were in the 
highdebt category and some were technically involvent with debts 
equalling or exceeding assets 
similar measures will be used in this years survey to see how 
farms performed in 1988 
this survey goes directly to the source farmers themselves to 
develop an accurate picture of the diverse financial conditions in 
agriculture said nass administrator charles caudill it helps 
ensure that the decisions affecting farmers are based on reliable 
data rather than someones best guesses

the governments report of a modest increase in factory orders in 
november has led analysts to conclude that the economy is continuing 
to grow moderately 
orders to us factories for manufactured goods increased by 03 
percent during the month the commerce department said wednesday 
the economic report had relatively little impact on the financial 
markets which were looking ahead to what the labor department would 
report on friday about the nations december unemployment rate 
stock prices staged a sharp rally wednesday rebounding from the 
losses they suffered in the first session of 1989 the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials which fell 2393 on tuesday climbed 
3304 points to 217768 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks but 
demand for stocks was limited by fears that fridays unemployment 
report would show a big job gain leading the federal reserve to 
tighten credit to stave off inflation

in the dollar but showing concern about the possibility of a big 
gain in december employment the treasurys benchmark 30year bond 
fell 116 point as its yield edged up to 908 percent

planes shot down two libyan fighter jets over the mediterranean sea 
investors take refuge in dollars in troubled times

an initiative prohibiting california 
insurers from canceling policies places the industry in perpetual 
bondage claimed a lawyer for four travelers insurance companies 
covering 22000 motorists 
the statement came during a hearing called by the state 
department of insurance in the aftermath of novembers passage of 
the measure which would rollback premiums and place several other 
limits on the insurance industry 
kent keller a lawyer for travelers also argued at wednesdays 
session that applying the restrictions to a companys 
preproposition 103 policies was unintended by the initiative and 
would be unfair travelers which plans to withdraw from the 
automobile insurance business in the state has written such 
policies in california since 1897 
its such a basic american principle of justice that you dont 
change the rules while the games going on without allowing somebody 
to get out keller said he said the company had no notice of 
proposition 103 restrictions when it wrote the policies 
but patricia staggs a lawyer for the state replied that the 
voters intended the measure to have immediate effect on notices 
of cancellation 
staggs acknowledged that travelers has the right to withdraw from 
the state but declared that until withdrawal is approved the 
companies must renew their automobile insurance policies under terms 
of the voterapproved initiative 
kellers arguments also were derided by state sen alan robbins 
chairman of the senate insurance claims and corporations committee 
this poor beleaguered little innocent insurance company being 
picked upon brought tears to my eyes said robbins dvan nuys 
who was allowed to take part in the hearing despite the claims of a 
lack of notice he added travelers was well aware of proposition 
103 for the last year and contributed 1 million to the campaign to 
defeat the measure and pass a nofault insurance initiative that was 
defeated nov 8 
they dont really want to leave california robbins said 
they want the department of insurance to allow them to dump their 
automobile insurance policies and allow them to receive 800 million 
from other lines of insurance 
the onehour hearing was the first called by the department on an 
alleged violation by an insurance company of proposition 103 the 
consumersponsored measure that was passed nov 8 
hearing officer john faber deferred a ruling apparently until 
the end of the month the decision which involves the scope of a 
key provision of proposition 103 on renewal of auto insurance could 
be appealed in court 
the measure whose backers included consumer advocate ralph 
nader is being challenged by insurance companies in separate 
proceedings in the state supreme court the court has allowed most 
provisions to take effect but has blocked the 20 percent rollback in 
auto and property insurance rates while the case is pending 
the four travelers subsidiaries which write 41 million a year 
in auto insurance policies according to company figures applied to 
withdraw from california the day before the election and stopped 
renewing policies dec 23 company spokesman dan kaferle said about 
700 renewals have been refused since then 
the department responded by invoking a provision of proposition 
103 that forbids nonrenewal of an auto insurance policy except in 
cases of fraud nonpayment or a substantial increase in the insured 
risk the companies are violating those provisions each time they 
refuse to renew a policy for any other reasons the department said 
but keller said the department was wrong for two reasons the 
restrictions cant be applied to companies that are withdrawing from 
the state and shouldnt be applied to insurance policies that were 
written before proposition 103 was passed 
the decision to leave one of the largest markets in the nation 
was not an easy one they have a basic american right to choose 
he said 
to apply the nonrenewal limitations to companies that are 
withdrawing from the market is to place them in perpetual 
bondage keller added 
the four travelers subsidiaries are travelers indemnity co 
charter oak fire insurance co travelers indemnity co of america 
and phoenix insurance co their applications to withdraw from 
business in california apply only to their automobile insurance 
policies 
a spokesman for the companies would not say how many other 
travelers subsidiaries offer automobile insurance

digital equipment corp missed out on the 
personal computer boom but it hopes a big product announcement next 
week will keep it abreast of the next wave in computing desktop 
workstations 
officials of the worlds second biggest computer maker said 
wednesday they would introduce advanced workstations along with new 
software and industrystandard personal computers in a major news 
conference on tuesday 
its probably the most significant desktop announcement weve 
ever made donald mcinnis vice president of digitals engineering 
systems group said in a telephone interview 
digital the minicomputer giant based in maynard mass lost out 
on billions of dollars in potential revenue from personal computers 
because its founder and president kenneth olsen underestimated the 
importance of the machines 
the company kept building bigger and more powerful clusters of 
minicomputers to compete with international business machines corp 
its bigger rival 
two previous attempts to catch up in the pc business failed the 
rainbow which did not run industrystandard software and the 
vaxmate which was too expensive in its third attempt digital is 
showing some humility by selling personal computers made for it by 
tandy corp according to digital specifications 
its stating for the world that yes were going to be in the 
low end of the market said sonny monosson editor of the 
monosson report on dec and ibm 
in the smaller but fastergrowing workstation business where 
digital already has the second biggest share of the world market 
despite selling relatively slow machines the company plans two 
lines of fast and relatively cheap entries that should expand its 
market share 
workstations are speedy desktop computers capable of displaying 
intricate graphics and are used primarily by scientists engineers 
and other technical professionals 
as a sign of the importance digital attaches to workstations the 
company will break from tradition by selling one line incapable of 
running programs written for its own vax vms operating system the 
new line will run only programs written for ultrix digitals 
version of the unix operating system 
for the new workstation digital had to choose between speed and 
compatibility and it chose speed by using a microprocessor supplied 
by mips computer systems inc that cannot handle vms instructions 
in the software area digital scored a major but littlenoticed 
victory last week when the open software foundation a standards 
group selected its technology as the standard for the means by 
which programs appear in windows on a computer screen 
technology from microsoft corp and hewlettpackard co was 
selected as the standard for the look and feel or surface 
trimmings of the screen presentation the decision on standards 
should help simplify life for computer users and programmers 
until now weve had chaos and anarchy in terms of standards at 
the desktop mcinnis said 
the emphasis on desktop computers is a return to digitals roots 
the company was founded in 1957 to build small computers better 
suited to individual users than the powerful but complicated 
mainframe computers dominant at the time 
analysts differed on how digitals new workstations would fare 
against the competition of sun microsystems inc apollo computer 
inc and others 
they overtook and passed apollo in 88 with this new line of 
products i think theyre going to overtake sun said jonathan 
cohler editorinchief of digital review an independent weekly 
newspaper based in boston 
but russell crabs an analyst for soundview financial group in 
stamford conn said the highpowered workstation will not take off 
right away because there is not enough software written for 
digitals ultrix 
i think its a defensive move primarily against sun he said 
digital will trumpet the new products in a press conference in 
littleton mass and other presentations that day and the next in 
santa clara calif london paris copenhagen denmark sydney 
australia and tokyo

venezuelan presidentelect carlos andres perez 
says he and president carlos salinas de gortari of mexico have 
agreed to combat falling oil prices and the massive foreign debts 
facing their nations economies 
our countries have suffered the buffeting of the fall in oil 
prices perez told a news conference wednesday after he met with 
salinas during a oneday visit to mexico 
but he said that he shared with the new mexican president 
optimism about the possibilities of a stabilization of the 
petroleum market soon 
perez who will be inaugurated feb 2 said tentative steps 
toward strengthening the oil market could be made during a meeting 
of representatives from nonopec governments scheduled for late 
january in london 
venezuela is a founding member of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries the 13nation pricefixing cartel that in the 
past was unable to limit its members oil exports to bolster prices 
perez said he was optimistic opec would be able to keep prices 
from falling further 
mexico the worlds sixth largest oil producer is not a member 
of opec but closely follows the cartels pricing and production 
guidelines about half the oil that pemex the mexican state 
petroleum monopoly sells abroad goes to the united states 
he also said he and salinas discussed the foreign debt which he 
said acted like a vise on the economy of venezuela he said the 
two leaders agreed to continue discussions on the debt with other 
latin american heads of state and announced he planned to visit 
president jose sarney of brazil later this week 
we seek agreement among latin american countries to find 
reasonable solutions with our creditors perez declared earlier 
wednesday 
he said he believed the united states under presidentelect 
george bush could help latin america overcome its foreign debt 
burden 
we will have the opportunity for great american cooperation 
with our countries in latin america great opportunities for 
development said perez who met recently with bush 
venezuela on saturday suspended principal payments on most of its 
26 billion in foreign bank debt claiming it was short of money 
because of low prices for its crude oil exports mexico is trying to 
renegotiate payments on its 106 billion debt the second largest 
after brazils among developing countries 
both nations say debt payments dont leave enough money for 
investment and economic growth 
he said venezuelas decision to suspend debt payments was taken 
after exhausting all efforts to comply with its commitments the 
measure also was taken to ask for a fairer treatment from 
creditors he said 
perez said if no solution is found to the debt problem the 
severe economic difficulties of venezuela brazil and mexico could 
extend to other countries 
perez said he will seek rational negotiations after he takes 
office in search of understanding and not confrontation he said 
venezuelas export income amounted to 7 billion in 1988 while debt 
servicing totalled 56 billion

united steelworkers announced a settlement in a 
dispute with ltv steel corp over profit sharing and said that in 
upcoming talks with other producers profit sharing may be 
appropriate but a basic wage increase is better 
we certainly are opposed to the idea that while the ceos and 
executives and everybody else are making out pretty well that the 
workers should somehow be prevented from having an improvement in 
their basic standard usw president lynn williams said wednesday 
our members were willing to make sacrifices in times of 
trouble he said our workers have a right to have an input into 
their companies and share in things on the upside 
at a news conference outlining the unions philosophical stance 
for talks later this year with bethlehem steel corp inland steel 
industries inc armco inc and national steel corp usw leaders 
announced the settlement with ltv that will distribute an estimated 
100 million to about 18000 active union members 
they will be paid in april an average of 180 for each hour they 
worked in 1988 in addition ltv will distribute stock worth an 
estimated 70 cents for each hour worked 
a year of fulltime work amounts to 2080 hours per worker so 
the payments would amount to about 5200 in cash and stock for a 
fulltime worker 
the company will also reimburse 38000 retired union members for 
payments they made last year toward health insurance coverage 
union officials said the profit sharing would be worth about 100 
million although the figure is tentative 
its really a vindication of our position bernard kleiman 
chief counsel for the union said at a news conference 
neither party achieved all of what it sought david h hoag 
ltv steel president and chief executive said in a printed statement 
ltv claimed its 13 billion thirdquarter net loss would result 
in a distribution of stock but no cash to the usw members the union 
argued the companys financial condition warranted a cash payout 
despite writedowns that contributed to the thirdquarter loss 
local union presidents voted overwhelmingly tuesday in pittsburgh 
to accept the settlement but no announcement of the results was 
made until wednesday 
the presidents were assembled to help set goals for upcoming 
contract negotiations with four major producers as union leaders 
have declared previously negotiators want the producers to give 
back at least a portion of the wages and benefits usw members 
sacrificed during two previous rounds of contract bargaining since 
1983 
with major steelmakers entering what is expected to be their 
third consecutive year of significant profits the opportunity 
is so much better than what it otherwise might have been for union 
members said usw president lynn williams 
the 134member wage and policy committee did not prioritize its 
goals for wage and benefit increases job security and work rules 
he said 
the timing of contract negotiations at ltv and 
wheelingpittsburgh will depend on the two companies reorganization 
in bankruptcy court usx the largest steelmaker has a contract 
that runs into 1991

chrysler corp has agreed to pay 51 million to 
about 150 former employees in a settlement of an age discrimination 
lawsuit filed in 1981 by a federal agency 
the equal employment opportunity commission claimed in its suit 
against chrysler motors corp the automakers manufacturing arm 
that the salaried workers were forced to retire because of their 
ages 
the case had been scheduled for trial tuesday but chrysler 
agreed dec 30 to the settlement under which it admitted no 
liability or wrongdoing the automaker reached a 29 million 
settlement earlier last month with 82 other former salaried workers 
an important factor is that at the time this was happening the 
company was fighting for survival chrysler spokeswoman karen 
stewart said it was a time when the whitecollar staff was being 
significantly reduced 
the eeoc was to determine how the money would be distributed 
the case originally sought compensation for more than 1600 
employees allegedly forced to retire between 1978 and 1981 when 
chrysler was near bankruptcy said tom keenbaum a detroit attorney 
representing the exworkers

radon detectors are becoming popular items in 
hardware stores but a consumer group says theyre only as good as 
the laboratory that analyzes them and too often thats not any 
good at all 
the group public citizen maintained wednesday that nearly half 
of the 34 radon testing laboratories it evaluated had quality 
control problems the group sent test samples to seven of the 
largest labs and found dramatically false results in some cases 
while millions of americans are testing their homes for radon 
gas some may be using doityourself kits that provide dangerously 
misleading results joan claybrook president of public citizen 
told a news conference 
ms claybrook said public citizen purchased test kits and sent 
them in for analysis at the seven laboratories after filling them 
with radoncontaminated air obtained at two energy department 
laboratories the results at three of the labs were wide of the mark 
by 67 percent in one case 
executives from some of the laboratories however challenged the 
findings and suggested that public citizen an advocacy group 
founded by ralph nader had its own procedural and quality control 
shortcomings when testing the testers 
theyre drawing staggering conclusions on virtually nonexistent 
data complained ned doyle a spokesman for air check an arden 
nc laboratory that fared poorly in the public citizen evaluation 
he called the survey unscientific and unprofessional 
but ms claybrook defended the evaluation which relied heavily 
on laboratories answering detailed questionnaires and the eight 
separate test samples sent to some of the largest laboratories 
its not perfect information but its the best that has been done 
to date she said 
those tests show that an alarming number of the radon test kits 
currently on the market may not be doing the job she added 
according to the consumer group air check had an average error 
percentage of 457 percent for all kits sent in two samples in july 
and october including 675 percent in the july tests barringer 
laboratories of golden colo had an error percentage of 488 
percent in the october round of tests and douglas martin amp 
associates of emmaus pa had an error percentage of 268 percent 
in the july tests 
of the 27 laboratories evaluated by questionnaire 12 received a 
fair or poor rating on the basis of their quality control 
laboratory procedures and staff competence according to the 
consumer group 
richard martin president of douglas martin amp associates said 
two canisters sent by public citizen recorded the wrong time period 
during which the kits were in use throwing off calculations used in 
the analysis 
john lovell vice president of barringer laboratories 
acknowledged in an interview some quality control problems in 
october but attributed part of the problem to a jump in business 
after the epa publicly urged all homeowners in september to conduct 
tests 
since then he said quality control procedures have been 
upgraded 
doyle the air check spokesman suggested that public citizen 
failed to follow instructions in using the test kits 
radon a colorless and odorless radioactive gas seeps from the 
ground through foundations and can reach unsafe levels in an enclosd 
area scientists believe a significant exposure to radon can cause 
lung cancer 
but there are no federal standards for either the radon detection 
kits or the laboratories while the epa periodically sends test 
samples to the scores of laboratories that have entered the radon 
testing business critics say the labs are notified of the test 
samples in advance and can take special care in dealing with them 
public citizen wants congress to give the epa authority to 
certify testing labs and test kits and to set minimum standards 
epa spokesman chris rice said the agency plans to begin some 
blind tests in march but does not plan to push for greater 
regulatory power 
we dont think we need a certification program he said 
adding that the overthecounter kits are only designed as a 
preliminary indicator and need not be exceedingly accurate

european trade representatives say they 
will seek permission to slap stiff duties on us imports of dried 
fruit and walnuts to retaliate against sanctions against european 
products 
any such approval would escalate a trade dispute between the 
united states and the european economic community sparked by a 
european ban on imports of american meat treated with growth 
hormones 
nico wegter an eec spokesman said thursday that representatives 
of the 12 nations making up the common market trading bloc will be 
given a proposal calling for the retaliatory measures 
the plan drawn up by the blocs executive body the european 
commission will be offered to counter sanctions the united states 
put into effect sunday to retaliate against the european meat ban 
american officials have raised the possibility of taking more 
actions against the europeans if the trading bloc strikes back 
wegter said the proposal recommends imposing 100 percent tariffs 
on dried fruit and walnut imports from the united states an earlier 
list had included honey and canned corn 
total eec imports of walnuts mostly to germany averaged 588 
million annually over the 198587 period wegter said dried fruit 
imports mainly to germany and italy averaged 378 million during 
that period dried fruit products include apples pears apricots 
peaches prunes and papayas 
the commissions proposal does not set a date for application of 
the tariffs but recommends they be put in place as soon as possible 
the trade fight was set off by the enforcement on sunday of an 
eec ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones 
the trading bloc wants to prohibit for health reasons all meat from 
such animals 
the ban is expected to halt the importation of about 100 million 
worth of beef and beef byproducts from the united states some of 
which are used in pates and sausages meat used to make pet food is 
exempted 
us officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten 
cattle a common practice among american farmers does not pose a 
health risk 
the ban was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 but the trading 
bloc agreed to delay it for a year it has since refused american 
appeals for yet another postponement 
the meat imports represent a small portion of the estimated 166 
billion in trade between the united states and the common market 
in retaliation for the meat ban the united states on sunday 
imposed 100 percent duties on boneless beef hams and pork 
shoulders prepared or preserved tomatoes instant coffee fermented 
alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol by 
volume certain fruit juices and certain packaged pet food made 
from grains the sanctions are worth about 100 million 
the common market has filed a complaint with the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade to protest the us sanctions the 
96nation gatt is both an agreement and a forum for ensuring the 
free movement off goods around the world the complaint was filed in 
november before the sanctions went into effect

the wheat market has been especially strong in recent weeks 
wheat futures prices rose to new 7year highs wednesday on news

subsidized prices

in speculative buying and open interest which refers to the total 
number of buy and sell orders that have not yet been cancelled out 
by opposing orders 
a lot of new longs or buy orders went into the market 
yesterday and open interest went up dramatically and i think that 
spooked a few people said cathy leow a grain market analyst with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york thats the reason 
for a little softness in terms of price

as the economic expansion shows signs of 
submitting to the unending pressure of federal reserve restraints 
many investors are growing concerned about the nearterm performance 
of stocks 
they reason that if interest rates continue to rise shortterm 
government notes already yield well over 9 percent they will draw 
funds from stocks and if a recession comes corporate earnings will 
face big obstacles 
the solution forget the near term keep your eyes on the future 
attach yourself to the longterm growth patterns and forget the 
shortterm squiggles spare yourself worries save on brokers 
commissions defer capital gains 
this is a segment of the longterm record compiled by investment 
adviser gw perritt a former college professor and founder of 
investment information services 
since 1944 pershare earnings of the standard amp poors 500stock 
index are 217 times higher representing a 7 percent compound 
annual growth rate annual dividends have grown too by 65 percent 
a year or 156 times greater 
the course wasnt steady earnings fell at times but overall an 
upward trend persisted pershare earnings averaged 1 between 1940 
and 1945 grew to 284 in the next five years doubled by 1968 and 
doubled again by 1978 
today the sampp is around 270 pershare index earnings are 2170 
and pershare dividends are about 1011 now project these figures 
11 years into the future at the growth rates of the past 
fourandahalf decades 
the result by the dawn of the year 2000 pershare earnings 
growing at a 7 percent compound annual rate become 4535 
pershare dividends swell to 2022 
we are just getting warmed up says perritt consider if the 
average priceearnings multiple of the sampp index is applied to these 
projections the index will be valued at 621 by the year 2000 thats 
229 times the current level 
alternatively a 229 multiple applied to a dow jones industrial 
average of 2150 points yields an average of 4923 
remember these arent idle dreams they are projections based on 
what has happened in the past and they do not even tell the entire 
story 
theres more good news says perritt in his newsletter 
investment horizons 
if the index continually provides an annual dividend yield of 36 
percent and if you reinvest dividends when earned you tack on 
another 47 percent increment it adds up to a total return of 237 
percent 
while 7 percent represents actual earnings growth over more than 
four decades some people might consider it too optimistic a goal 
for the future but step it down to 5 percent and you still get a 
507 sampp and a 4035 dow 
it is difficult to stand pat in the stock market considering the 
daily excitement the constant flow of investment advice the 
telephone calls of the brokers the warnings the fears the fads 
the medias need for something new 
but among many patient reasonable folks figures such as these 
overwhelm the shortterm fluctuations and repeated studies of model 
portfolios document the case 
the inandout trader pays commissions to sell and then to rebuy 
the longterm investor keeps his money should there be profits the 
inandout trader must pay capital gains taxes the longtermer 
defers those taxes indefinitely 
the wonderful irony of it is that the longtermer works less and 
worries less and gets paid better for the pleasure of it

us banks are no longer threatened with 
failing because of uncollected third world debts the nations top 
banking regulators said today 
most of the regional banks have put the ldc less developed 
countries situation behind them l william seidman chairman of 
the federal deposit insurance corp told the house banking 
committee 
while large ldc exposure by some major banks will be with us 
for years to come at this time we cannot foresee any bank failures 
resulting from ldc exposure alone seidman said 
manuel h johnson vice chairman of the federal reserve board 
said us bank exposure to the 15 major third world debtors declined 
by 86 billion between july 1987 and the same month last year to 
76 billion 
a disproiportionate share of this reduction was accounted for 
by large regional banks as distinct from the largest multinational 
banks johnson said nonetheless the top nine banks reduced 
their total exposure over the year by 26 billion to 53 
billion 
he said small and regional banks have largely abandoned further 
international lending in developing countries and have reduced what 
exposure they had by selling or swapping the loans at discounts on 
secondary markets 
the larger banks he said have not been willing to discount 
their loans to the third world countries as much 
seidman said the nine major us money center banks have reduced 
their outstanding loans to 31 less developed countries from 61 
billion in december 1982 to roughly 55 billion as of last year 
during the same period he said they have raised their aggregate 
primary capital from 32 billion to 65 billion 
meanwhile the debt servicing capacity of the six largest 
borrowers argentina brazil chile mexico the philippines and 
venezuela well exceeds the 40 percent value the secondary market 
is putting on the loans seidman said 
presidentelect bush promised last month to take a whole new 
look at third world debt now estimated at 132 trillion 
including loans from other countries and multinational institutions 
such as the world bank 
but former treasury secretary james a baker iii bushs nominee 
to be the new secretary of state and treasury secretary nicholas 
brady both declined an invitation to testify at todays hearing 
the committees new chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said wednesday he was disappointed but added he expects the 
administration to develop a policy quickly on what he called a 
growing crisis 
seidman and johnson declined to characterize the situation as a 
crisis saying there has been great progress since 1982 when mexico 
suddenly stopped paying interest on its debt because of plummeting 
oil prices 
at the time some feared that the whole international banking 
system could collapse the book value of loans from us banks to 
third world countries then was 1397 billion and the banks had only 
662 billion in capital to cover them if the countries defaulted 
while the book value of the loans has fallen by 42 billion 
banks have increased their capital to 1397 billion as of last 
june the congressional general accounting office said wednesday 
greatly reducing their exposure 
the gao said a major component of the turnaround was 23 billion 
that regulators required the banks to set aside as special reserves 
and another 20 billion that banks have voluntarily set aside over 
the past year and a half to cover loan losses 
however that is not enough the gao said estimating that 49 
billion of loss reserves would more accurately reflect the 
diminished value of the loans 
meanwhile the world bank says third world countries in 1988 paid 
out 43 billion more in servicing the debt than they received in new 
loans and investments from developed countries 
although the banks increased their reserves because they know 
they are not going to be repaid in full they continue to insist on 
debtservice payments based on face value the rev j bryan 
hehir a social policy counselor for the us catholic conference 
told the committee 
the result of austerity programs to service the debt hehir said 
is growing poverty malnutrition and unemployment and because of 
cuts in health programs the reappearance of diseases thought to 
have been eradicated 
living standards in the 1980s have declined more than 25 
percent in subsaharan africa and 15 percent in latin america and 
both regions are deeper in debt than ever he said all of 
this spells recession leads latin americans in particular to 
question their leaders economic strategy and breeds revolution

she says that tobacco remains legal today solely by historical 
accident and political maneuvering 
the accident is that millions of americans became addicted to 
tobacco before the hazards of smoking were widely recognized and 
before products sold to the public were systematically reviewed for 
safety the maneuvering involves skillful political manipulation by 
the tobacco industry to obtain exemption from every law and 
authority designed to protect the public from hazardous substances 
she says that with falling domestic demand the industry is 
aiming more at foreign markets the third world especially asia 
for instance japan where 63 percent of the males smoke and china 
where 70 percent of the males smoke only 27 percent of american men 
smoke she says 
furthermore american cigarettes sold abroad are higher by far in 
tars and nicotine than domestic brands 
indeed those 25 years ago when the surgeon general first 
attacked smoking most smokers cut down and looked to the industry 
to provide them with safer cigarettes which the industry did 
opponents who had pressed for safer cigarettes then pressed for 
none at all 
the strength of the new attack on smoking has the fervor and the 
rationale of mothers against drunk drivers the national academy 
of sciences in 1986 legitimized studies that held that nonsmokers 
were endangered by environmental tobacco smoke which was called ets 
that same year the surgeon general said that 20 years of 
accumulating evidence allowed the verdict it is now clear that 
disease risk due to the inhalation of tobacco smoke is not limited 
to the individual who is smoking but can extend to those who inhale 
tobacco smoke emitted into the air 
while urging changes he emphasized that those changes should 
not be designed to punish the smoker 
cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and the individual 
smoker must decide whether or not to continue that behavior 
however it is evident from the data presented in this volume that 
the choice to smoke cannot interfere with the nonsmokers right to 
breathe air free of tobacco smoke 
while the studies have been criticized they are largely 
statistical and have not been refuted but since many smokers have a 
guilty conscience about their habit anyway efforts to fight off the 
increasing repression make little headway 
not that there have not been efforts philip morris publishes a 
glossy entertaining magazine that has become a rallying point for 
smokers militant enough to fight back introduced in 1985 with a 
circulation of 150000 the free magazine claims a circulation today 
of 12 million and a readership of 24 million 
it reports local and national efforts to restrict the rights of 
smokers and provides a vent for some of the emotions of those who 
feel they are persecuted by the nonsmoking movement 
publisher guy smith explains that its surveys produce a profile 
of the american smoker that should command attention in the 
marketplace 
we want detroit to know that smokers buy cars a lot of cars 
furthermore we want detroit to know that although some people 
complain about cars with ashtrays there are still millions of car 
owners who smoke and use ashtrays 
if the message is aimed at automakers it is also aimed at 
politicians restaurateurs and others who serve the general public 
consider the philip morris statistics smokers own 35 million 
cars 5 million of them new last year they have 38 million tv sets 
23 million vcrs 5 million home computers 30 million credit cards 
sixtyfive percent of them are married and 40 percent have children 
almost 90 percent are registered voters and the vast majority said 
they voted in the last election they are affluent educated active 
in community affairs and charitable organizations every day 21 
million of them go out to eat 
that does not jibe with the statistics of the nonsmoking 
movement which sees smoking as largely a bluecollar problem the 
affluent bettereducated having fled the smoking ranks 
everybodys statistics show the number of women who smoke is 
bucking an otherwise downward trend especially young women the 
nonsmoking people say this is especially disheartening because 
smoking by a prospective mother has been shown to be injurious to 
the fetus during pregnancy 
some 35 million americans have quit most of them obeying the 
strictures of the american cancer society the american heart 
association the american medical association and myriad other 
health groups allied against smoking 
as a social experiment the campaign for a smokefree america has 
made remarkable strides but it is not the first attempt to stomp 
out the lowly weed 
they tried whipping in russia and beheading in turkey and in 
this country health issues were a prime motive in the late 1800s 
now its local bans on smoking as in new york city and beverly 
hills curtailed advertising and special taxes 35 cents more a pack 
in california 
todays antismoking movement is hardnosed and persistent 
thanks to federal involvement it is an emotional confrontation

gone are the days of the toothy tirekicking car 
salesmen clad in loud sports jackets 
replacing them are todays multipledealership wellheeled 
businessmen with one eye on the auto industry and the other on real 
estate 
theyre called megadealers often they control dozens of 
businesses sometimes in a variety of states the growth of the 
megadealers along with high technology and wages could spell trouble 
for smaller singlenameplate dealerships 
i see the little people getting out and the bigger people 
getting bigger said megadealer max pearson president of the 
pearson companies of richmond va 
megadealers have nearly as many ways of operating as they have 
cars on their lots 
some limit their businesses and their locations dealer services 
inc of westbury ny for instance handles just imported cars 
honda acura subaru saab and isuzu and only on long island 
some like pearson companies are spread across the country and 
sell a variety of cars and light trucks 
pearson companies is made up of 18 dealerships 11 in virginia 
three in florida and four in texas those stores sell cars and light 
trucks carrying acura chevrolet dodge eagle honda hyundai 
jeep lincoln mercury mitsubishi nissan oldsmobile pontiac 
subaru and toyota nameplates 
variety like that is what megadealers are all about no matter if 
theyre under one roof in one city or spread out nationwide 
if you diversify and have representation in all facets of the 
market and one part gets weak then the others hold it up pearson 
said 
the business philosophy that drove pearson and others to acquire 
more dealerships is reflected in numbers of outlet and the number of 
people who own then 
between 1979 and 1987 according to the national automobile 
dealership association the number of dealerships nationwide has 
dropped 11 percent falling to about 25000 from 28000 while the 
number of dealership owners has declined 32 percent to 17000 from 
25100 
you really are seeing a significant shift toward megadealers 
nada spokeswoman mary beth robinson said 
it seems to be the way to go said jim mucciello controller 
of dealer services it doesnt put all your eggs in one basket 
such diversification takes lots of money 
twenty years ago you could go out with 200000 to 400000 
and you could get into a dealership nada executive vice president 
frank mccarthy said today the dealerships are costing anywhere 
from 25 million to 4 million on the conservative side 
he said auto manufacturers require between 10 percent and 20 
percent in available capital before allowing a dealership to market 
its vehicles he added 
the business today is a closed society mccarthy said it 
costs so much money to get into this business and you have to have 
expertise to get in 
theres not too many people who have that combination as a 
result you have existing dealerships who buy up other dealerships 
compounding the costs of getting cars and parts is securing the 
property the dealership sits on 
land values in this country are wild and wooly right now 
general motors corp chairman roger smith said in a recent interview 
we just opened a dealership in long island city ny where 
its an office building we built nd theres a dealership on the main 
floor he said the office building upstairs helps carry the 
rent so that you can have a dealership in what otherwise would be an 
impossible location just because of the land value 
real estate costs are high on the minds of businessmen like ken 
meade of the meade group which assembles a number of dealerships on 
the same piece of land meade and his grosse pointe farmsbased 
business is developing michigans first singleowner auto mall in 
it he plans to have eight dealerships with a common body shop and 
service area and related businesses including a car wash and a fast 
oil change operation 
as in other states michigan cities and suburbs have strips where 
automobile dealers have sprung up some dealers in troy have banded 
together as the troy motor mall in advertising but those businesses 
are independently owned and operated 
meade has commitments from toyota and jeepeagle for dealerships 
and is negotiating with others which he wont identify for space 
in his business near utica about 20 miles north of detroit 
his planned automotive mall is near the 160store lakeside mall 
and meade said he will offer shuttle bus service to the shopping 
center for customers waiting for their cars to be serviced 
heightening the attraction of the multidealership mall 
in addition to real estate costs the price of getting into the 
carselling business is rising because of the costs of hightech 
equipment and qualified people to use it 
thats putting the squeeze on the little guy like emmett ysser 
owner of emmett ysser inc of savannah tenn about 100 miles east 
of memphis 
at little stores its difficult to have the capital to do the 
things that the megaboys can do said ysser who sells chevrolet 
dodge chrysler and plymouth cars and light trucks 
in the last 10 years theres been greater change in selling 
cars than the first 40 years its in line with technology said 
ysser whose dealership started by his father will celebrate 50 
years in business in 1989 
the cost of new equipment is compounded by the growing complexity 
of todays automobiles machines that help mechanics fix problems 
and keep cars running are becoming highly specialized ysser said 
meaning a larger investment applies to a smaller part of his service 
business 
in the past he said you take a diagnostic piece of equipment 
that sells for 2000 and do 90 percent of your repairs now you go 
to 20000 of equipment for 5 percent which means the bigger 
operations can afford it more than we can 
a megadealership may have two machines and eight stores and run 
them back and forth cutting costs and increasing profits ysser 
said 
no matter what changes have occurred small dealers like ysser 
and big dealers like meade agree a trend is growing toward 
megadealers its a word meade says should be struck from the 
vocabulary 
the dealers that own different franchises have been around for 
a long time meade said somebody named it mega in 1983 and it 
stuck

toyota motor corp officials heaved a collective 
sigh of relief thursday after learning the companys new lexus line 
of luxury cars could keep its name at least for now 
whoa thats good news jim perkins senior vice president of 
the japanese companys lexus division said after being told of the 
ruling in a new york federal court 
mead data general inc has sued toyota claiming that the lexus 
name diluted the business of its lexis legal information retrieval 
service 
a federal district judge issued a restraining order last week 
forbidding toyota from using the lexus name but an appeals court 
delayed implementation of that order earlier this week 
the ruling thursday by the 2nd circuit court of appeals in new 
york extended the reprieve on a limited basis at least until jan 
30 when the appellate court will hear arguments on the merits of 
the case by lawyers from both sides 
the extension came just as toyota was unveiling its lexus line at 
the north american auto show which runs through jan 15 in detroit 
lexus also has a display running the same time at the los angeles 
auto show 
company officials had nervously wondered whether they would have 
to cover up the names of the cars at their swank exhibits 
we could have changed it the display in four hours said 
perkins 
appellate judge emilia kearse said toyota may continue to use the 
lexus name at the auto shows and at other expositions but cannot 
advertise lexus nationally until the matter is settled 
lawyers from both sides were happy with thursdays decision 
essentially they have given each side part of what it 
wanted said mead attorney charles j farouki 
arthur d gray who represents toyota said were pleased with 
the result 
were one step further added bob mccurry executive vice 
president of toyota motor sales usa inc i think it shows that we 
have a case there 
toyota and the lexus division have dropped millions of dollars 
into the lexus name since it was agreed upon in august 1987 
the lexus booth at the detroit auto show features two fourdoor 
sedans the ls400 and es250 which vary in cost from 20000 to 
40000 and are aimed at buyers ready for luxury cars but unwilling 
to pay more for european imports 
the legal dispute with mead has attracted heavy press attention 
to the lexus exhibit where reporters got a preview before the 
exposition opens to the public saturday 
our most immediate job is to earn name recognition for lexus 
said perkins unfortunately were doing it the hard way

corn futures prices closed moderately higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade in a late rally fanned by 
rumors of an expansion of the longterm grain agreement between the 
united states and the soviet union 
the nov 28 extension of the previous 5year ussoviet grain 
pact set the maximum amount of soviet purchases of us grain at 12 
million metric tons a year that limit was expanded to 16 million 
metric tons on dec 23 
rumors on thursday that the agriculture department planned to 
expand the maximum purchase limit to 20 million metric tons sparked 
a buying frenzy in the corn futures pit shortly before the close 
analysts said 
cathy leow a grainmarket analyst with thomsonmckinnon 
securities inc in new york said an expansion was almost inevitable 
since the soviets have already bought nearly 16 million metric tons 
of us grain 
theyre already bumping up against the maximum she said 
at the close of trading wheat was 1 cent lower to cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in march at 448 a bushel corn was 
cent to 3 cents higher with march at 287 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to 1 cent higher with march at 245 a bushel soybeans

the new york mercantile exchange said thursday it 
has joined a worldwide automated network that will enable it to 
trade energy and metals futures and options roundtheclock starting 
next year 
nymex the worlds leading energy exchange said it signed an 
agreement in principle to become a partner in globex a trading 
system being developed by the chicago mercantile exchange and 
reuters holdings plc of britain 
globex is scheduled to begin operating in october when the 
chicago exchange will begin using the system the new york exchange 
will enter the system in the first half of 1990 
the agreement already approved by the governing boards of both 
exchanges is subject to approval by members of the nymex a special 
vote is scheduled for jan 26 
the need exists for a 24hour trading system for all 
international futures and options products said lou guttman 
chairman of nymex globex represents the optimum solution to 
facilitate that need it integrates our present open outcry system 
with current technological advancements in a manner that draws the 
best from both 
like the chicago exchange nymex will list its products for 
trading on globex only when its trading pits are closed to preserve 
the current open outcry system the new york exchange currently 
trades between 810 am and 310 pm est 
nymex is the first exchange to become a partner in the globex 
system in addition to energy contracts such as oil and gasoline 
it will trade metals such as platinum 
two other new york futures exchanges the commodity exchange and 
the new york cotton exchange said thursday they also were 
considering offering their products for trading on the globex system 
the chicago merc and reuters announced in september 1987 their 
plan to develop the computerized system that would allow 
roundtheclock trading of the mercs financial futures contracts 
the goal of globex is to capture more of the rapidly growing 
business from europe and the far east especially japan the 
increasing amount of japanese investment in the united states has 
created among japanese investors a desire to hedge or protect 
their investments from volatile pricing by buying and selling 
futures contracts 
the chicago board of trade the chicago mercs fiercest 
competitor has been luring more overseas business by extending its 
trading hours 
the cbot urged the commodity futures trading commission in 
september to reject the globex proposal claiming that because 
trades would not occur in the traditional manner the system was 
inherently susceptible to abuse 
cbot spokesman ray carmichael said thursday his exchange had no 
comment on the nymexglobex linkup

soviet officials are cracking down on the highly 
successful cooperative movement banning the small private ventures 
from such lucrative operations as video salons and some medical care 
at a remarkable news conference thursday on the new restrictions 
bureaucrats criticized cooperatives for printing risque posters and 
skimming money off the most profitable businesses 
in a meeting later thursday the ruling communist party politburo 
called for creation of conditions for increasing the output and 
quality of goods turned out by cooperatives and bringing the prices 
of these goods closer to state prices the report on the politburo 
meeting by the tass news agency provided no details how that would 
be accomplished 
the crackdown seemed strikingly at odds with president mikhail s 
gorbachevs attempts to revive the stagnant economy by expanding 
cooperatives and reducing the power of the moscow ministries in a 
new years eve speech gorbachev specifically called for a 
stronger cooperative movement in 1989 
but a panel of eight officials of deputy ministerial rank told 
the news conference that coops had to be barred from businesses 
ranging from filmmaking to jewelry manufacturing because they are 
competing with their ministries for critically short supplies and 
making products of poor quality 
as an example ivan p korovkin deputy chairman of the state 
publishing committee unrolled a cooperativeproduced poster 
featuring a nude woman and a strategically placed black cat 
look much is of low quality and doubtful taste he said 
he proceeded to a pack of five trading cards depicting poplar 
soviet rock groups he said they were sold by a cooperative for 
about 48 cents when a state publishing house would have charged 
only about 5 cents 
they have received 600000 rubles 960000 profit just 
publishing these korovkin said clearly appalled he did not 
explain why state publishing houses are not printing items such as 
the cards even though 2 million people bought them 
paper is in short supply korovkin noted and the ministries 
must ensure it is used appropriately 
but vladimir yakovlev a leader in the cooperative movement 
sharply criticized the decree he said in a telephone interview 
after the news conference that it passed without the prior public 
debate gorbachev keeps promising as part of his democratic reforms 
yakovlev chairman of fact a moscowbased market research coop 
predicted a public outcry similar to the one last summer that 
forced revision of a plan to tax cooperatives up to 90 percent of 
their profits 
cooperatives have mushroomed since they were legalized two years 
ago and now more than 700000 soviets work for them sharing in the 
profits and taking home salaries several times higher than average 
most coops offer services or fashionable goods hard to find in 
enterprises run by government ministries 
korovkin also complained the cooperatives wanted to publish 
classics of russian literature modern literature posters and 
detective stories which are in high demand and short supply but 
not a single cooperative was publishing cheap books such as 
childrens stories and manuals for schools leaving that lowprofit 
business to the ministries 
a short supply of film also was cited as the reason for 
prohibiting cooperatives from producing their own movies 
even in state movies quality is not that high said vg 
makoveyev deputy of the state cinematography committee presumably 
implying that inadequate film supplies limit directors ability to 
reshoot scenes 
video salons popular cafes that offer armchairs and snacks to 
moviegoers watching rarely shown movies on bigscreen video are 
being banned because they violate copyright laws the bureaucrats 
said 
medical cooperatives which have been doing a booming business in 
a nation with free but often poorquality medical care are being 
sharply restricted because many were using stateowned equipment 
the officials said 
yakovlev noted that many of the medical and video cooperatives 
being put out of business by the decree have invested heavily in 
equipment which the state must now buy back 
he also worried that the decree failed to define banned 
publishing activities leaving advertising and informational items 
in a gray area he said moscow officials probably will permit 
advertising coops to continue but provincial authorities are much 
more conservative 
cooperatives also are being banned from any business involving 
foreign currency even though a law published in early december 
specifically encouraged coops to enter businesses that would earn 
the hard currency so desperately needed by the soviet union the 
cash restriction apparently is aimed at reducing blackmarketeering 
the new restrictions also ban cooperative schools wineries 
pharmaceutical manufacturing pawnshops lotteries and production 
of icons and other religious artifacts 
cooperatives will be allowed in certain areas such as concert 
promotion and medicine only under the wing of the appropriate state 
agency which will control their production and profits officials 
said 
officials said religious groups asked for the last restriction 
saying they depended on the sale of such goods for their own income 
they refused to identify the religious groups

assets of the nations 453 money market mutual 
funds fell 4495 million in the latest week the investment company 
institute said thursday 
the decline to 27803 billion in the sevenday period ended 
wednesday followed a revised 2461 million drop in the funds 
assets the previous week the washingtonbased mutual fund trade 
group said 
the funds assets hit a record high 28189 billion in the week 
ended nov 23 1988 
the investment company institute said that in the latest week

billion assets of 91 brokerdealer funds decreased 129 billion to 
11567 billion and assets of 136 institutional funds rose 5884 
million to 7241 billion 
the decline in assets of money market funds in the 
brokerdealer category overwhelmed the modest increases in assets of 
general purpose and institutional funds said jacob dreyer the 
institutes vice president and chief economist but it is 
extremely difficult to pinpoint the reasons for money flows at the 
turn of the year when investors decisions are heavily influenced 
by tax positioning balance sheet considerations and other 
transitory factors 
the sevenday average yield on money market mutual funds rose in 
the week ended tuesday to 839 percent from 818 percent the 
previous week according to donoghues money fund report a trade 
journal based in holliston mass 
the 30day average yield rose to 814 percent from 801 percent 
donoghues said 
the average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 29 
days down from 32 days donoghues said 
the newsletter bank rate monitor said its survey of 100 leading 
commercial banks savings and loan assocations and savings banks in 
the nations 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield 
available on money market accounts rose to 622 percent as of 
wednesday from 620 percent a week earlier 
the north palm beach flabased newsletter said the effective 
annual yield available on special savings accounts called super now 
accounts was unchanged at 513 percent 
bank rate monitor said the effective annual yield was 821 
percent on sixmonth certificates of deposit up from 818 the 
previous week yields were 848 percent on 1year cds up from 844

it had received similar assurances from groupe de la cite he 
said

adequate and whether to recommend the bid 
groupe de la cite had indicated in december it was prepared to 
pay 880 pence or 1584 for each collins voting share valuing the 
entire company at around 403 million pounds or 725 million just 
before christmas news international sweetened its own offer to 
match exactly the french bid 
groupe de la cite had approached news international wednesday

sell its 417 percent voting stake in collins but news 
international refused and the french firm withdrew its offer

the state investment board on thursday 
suspended business with drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street 
company that agreed last month to plead guilty to widespread 
securities fraud charges 
marshall burkes the boards executive director said the action 
was consistent with a policy against doing business with a company 
that admits or is found guilty of a felony 
the investment board which manages 18 billion in retirement and 
other funds paid slightly more than 500000 a year in commissions 
to drexel burnham less than 5 percent of its annual bill for 
commissions 
they are a substantial dealer but by no means a major 
dealer he said he said the suspension was indefinite 
we will reconsider the suspension if and when drexel can make a 
case that they have corrected their problems burkes said 
last week new york city suspended drexel from participation in an 
upcoming sale of municipal bonds in what was seen as a signal that 
other governmental moneyraising authorities may take similar action 
in the aftermath of the firms agreement to settle criminal charges 
drexel agreed dec 21 to pay the government a record 650 million 
in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felony counts after 
a two year criminal investigation of the firm by federal prosecutors

buying from my friends in the trade i can tell you its pretty 
definite they did take some cotton

french government would subsidize the withholding of 200000 metric 
tons of the ivorian cocoa from the market for two years to help 
stabilize prices 
but with worldwide cocoa supplies far outstripping demand ms

city said in a statement that the disciplinary measures were 
unpleasant but necessary

individuals at sundstrand with a report expected within 90 days

robert campeau the canadian who created a us 
retail empire by taking over two huge department store chains took 
to some of the nations biggest newspapers thursday to boast of his 
achievements and promise continued strength 
but the ads headlined nothing succeeds like success 
painted a picture of campeau corp that differs from the view 
presented by the companys disappointing sales and losses during 
1988 
having met all of our financial obligations in 1988 we project 
operating results for 1989 and beyond that are more than adequate to 
service all of our remaining obligations campeau said in the 
advertisement which appeared in such papers as the new york times 
the atlanta journal the atlanta constitution the los angeles times 
and the wall street journal 
because we have achieved so much in this last year it has been 
difficult for some to track and monitor our progress the ad said 
but you should know that we have had a truly outstanding 1988 
last year campeau defeated rh macy amp co inc in a takeover 
battle for federated department stores inc campeau paid 88 
billion for the company whose divisions included bloomingdales 
filenes foleys burdines richs and lazarus department store 
chains and ralphs grocery stores in california 
in december 1986 the canadian company purchased allied stores 
corp for 34 billion 
analysts have suggested the debt caused by the two purchases 
weakened campeaus operation 
the ad reported a 36 percent increase in operating earnings for 
the third quarter despite a retail environment we knew would be 
difficult and we expect strong results in the fourth quarter as 
well 
earlier this month campeau corp reported operating profit of 
437 million for the nine months ended oct 31 1988 however the 
company also said it had a net loss of 14 million compared to a 
net loss of 123 million for the same 1987 period 
allied divisions lost 183 million in the three months ended 
oct 29 while the federated stores lost 352 million 
thursdays advertisement also boasted of resounding christmas 
sales season separately campeau reported a 6 percent increase in 
christmas business 
that performance was in line with overall estimates for the 
retail industry but below increases reported by other retailers 
for example sears roebuck and co reported thursday its december 
sales rose 84 percent at may department stores co one of 
campeaus biggest compeititors sales were up 10 percent 
the ad hinted at thousands of layoffs at federated divisions 
saying 1988 was neither easy nor painless and we had to make 
some hard decisions and take some difficult actions but it also 
promised there would be no more sales of assets from campeaus 
retail holdings 
during 1988 campeau trimmed federated selling several 
department store chains foleys filenes bullocks and i magnin 
robert campeau also sold several specialty store chains and 
federateds gold circlerichway discount stores 
additionally 17 of allieds 24 store units have been sold off in 
the two years since campeau acquired the retailer leaving a handful 
of department store chains 
the advertisement said the divestitures had brought in 41 
billion and reduced original debt by 34 billion 
there were reports during the year that a planned sale of 
highyield bonds to help pay for the federated acquisition was 
postponed because of a lackluster response by investors 
investors were said to be uncertain about the highyield bond 
market in the wake of rjr nabisco inc and kraft inc takeovers but 
analysts said there also were concerns about campeaus own 
performance 
campeau denied the reports but in late october scaled back to 
750 million a planned 115 billion junk bond offering

the commodity futures trading commission on 
thursday proposed new rules designed to make it easier for banks 
investment houses and corporations to raise billions of dollars 
through a host of new investment products such as bonds linked to 
the price of oil and bank deposits tied to the exchange rate of the 
dollar 
by a 50 vote the commission which regulates futures and 
commodity options markets proposed a rule and issued an 
interpretative letter removing some kinds of socalled hybrid 
instruments from cftc regulation 
until now the commission has granted about 15 casebycase 
exceptions for hybrids that are predominantly a security or time 
deposit the interpretative letter and proposed rule set out the 
standards for further exemptions from cftc oversight 
commission chairwoman wendy l gramm said the new rules are aimed 
at removing the regulatory uncertainty that has discouraged the 
development of new products however she said the rules do not 
mean hybrids will go unregulated 
in the case of securities the instruments must be regulated by 
the securities and exchange commission in the case of bank 
deposits the issuing institution must be regulated by the federal 
deposit insurance corp the rules do not provide an exception for 
instruments offered by savings institutions 
todays releases represent an attempt to provide some 
stability they reduce regulatory duplications but they also 
eliminate regulatory gaps ms gramm said 
the interpretative letter takes effect immediately but is subject 
to change based on public comments offered in the next 45 days the 
related regulation being proposed will be open for public comment 
for the same period and the commission must adopt a final version 
before it takes effect 
hybrid instruments combine the characteristics of debt securities 
such as bonds or bank time deposits with certain characteristics of 
futures or commodity options 
examples include a bank deposit with its principal indexed to the 
exchange rate of the dollar and japanese yen or a corporate note 
with its yield tied to the price of gold or oil another kind of 
hybrid guarantees a set rate of return over inflation 
robert mackay the commissions chief of staff speculated that 
many us banks will take advantage of the new rules because 
starting dec 31 the federal reserve will allow them to offer 
deposit accounts in foreign currencies 
he said corporations and financial institutions potentially could 
raise billions of dollars with hybrid instruments 
robert r davis a cftc member since 1984 said thursdays action 
may represent the most significant actions taken by the commission 
during my tenure

a texas congressman says the reagan 
administrations failure to review a joint petroleum refining and 
marketing venture between texaco inc and saudi arabia is 
irresponsible and shortsighted 
rep john bryant last month asked treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady to investigate the joint venture star enterprise on national 
security grounds he and three other democratic members of congress 
sens howard metzenbaum of ohio and jeff bingamon of new mexico 
and rep edward markey of massachusetts contended the acquisition 
falls under the law enabling the government to block mergers 
involving foreign interests if there is evidence national security 
is threatened 
this is a perfect indication of how totally addicted this 
administration is to foreign cash and foreign takeovers to maintain 
their illusion of an economy thats going in the right direction 
bryant said 
bryant claimed this week that the texacosaudi deal presented 
legitimate national security concerns 
texaco inc and saudia arabia announced monday that they had 
closed the deal under which texaco and saudi refining inc would 
refine distribute and market petroleum products in 23 eastern and 
gulf coast states 
texaco said last year it expected to receive 812 million for a 
50 percent interest in its refining assets and marketing system and 
an additional 1 billion in benefits and savings 
bryant contends the deal could seriously increase us dependence 
on foreign oil erode the domestic oil industry and jeopardize 
consumers through possible market manipulation 
an interagency panel chaired by the treasury department the 
committee on foreign investment in the united states declined 
recently to review the venture a treasury spokesman said thursday 
the committee decided not to oppose this the committee decided 
not to investigate that there was no reason to investigate said 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity he said the 
committee had looked at the proposed venture in june and reached the 
same conclusion 
the administration in general favors foreign investment in the 
united states the spokesman said unless there is an overriding 
reason national security national interest to deny it we favor 
international movement of capital and that includes into the united 
states 
the sauditexaco venture would include three refineries 50 
distribution terminals 1400 service stations and 10000 franchised 
gasoline stations 
bryant said 96 percent of the three refineries capacity would be 
used to refine saudi crude 
bryant said that amounts to saudi arabia guaranteeing itself an 
outlet for crude oil into the american market giving the arab 
nation the option of lowering crude prices while earning increased 
prices at the gasoline marketing level 
i feel very concerned that it the deal is going forward 
without any review of the type the statute called for it is 
consistent with administration practices to go along with any kind 
of foreign takeover of any kind of american company its been their 
economic policy bryant said 
the purpose of the inquiry was to look and see if concerns we 
had had some validity to not even look is irresponsible and 
shortsighted he said

european officials tentatively agreed 
thursday to slap stiff duties on imports of american dried fruit and 
walnuts to retaliate against recent us sanctions against european 
products 
representatives of the 12nation european economic community left 
it to their nations foreign ministers to formally approve the 
measures and set the date for application of the higher tariffs the 
foreign ministers will meet jan 23 in brussels 
the hammer is raised but it wont actually fall until the 
ministers decide giving time for the americans to show a little 
understanding said an official of a member nation who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
formal approval of the sanctions would escalate a trade dispute 
between the united states and the common market trading bloc which 
was touched off sunday by a european ban on imports of american meat 
treated with growth hormones 
the united states retaliated against the meat ban by imposing 
also on sunday higher tariffs on a variety of european products 
alan holmer deputy us trade representative said in a 
satellite broadcast from washington that its presidential 
decision whether the united states would take further retaliatory 
measures against any european sanctions 
there would be very strong support in the us government for 
taking that kind of action if we were to reach that point he told 
foreign journalists in a program sponsored by the us government 
but frankly we hope we wont have to reach that point and that 
the eec will not take any kind of counterretaliatory steps in the 
next several weeks he said 
the european officials also tentatively decided to allow meat 
shipped from the united states before sunday to enter the common 
market until the end of the month officials said it was hoped that 
the united states would allow a similar grace period for sanctioned 
products from europe 
under the tentative plan the eec would impose 100 percent 
tariffs on dried fruit and unshelled walnuts imported from the 
united states an earlier list had included honey and canned corn 
total eec imports of walnuts mostly to germany averaged 588 
million annually over the 198587 period he said dried fruit 
imports mainly to germany and italy registered an annual average 
of 378 million during that period dried fruit products include 
apples pears apricots peaches prunes and papayas 
the transatlantic conflict was set off by the eec enforcement of 
the ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones 
the trading bloc wants to prohibit for health reasons all meat from 
such animals 
the ban is expected to halt the importation of about 100 million 
worth of beef and beef byproducts from the united states some of 
which are used in pates and sausages meat used to make pet food is 
exempted 
us officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten 
cattle a common practice among american farmers does not pose a 
health risk 
the community has failed to present any evidence that a 
proper application of the growthproducing hormones in question pose 
any threat to human or to animal health holmer said 
we as yet have seen no scientific evidence whatsoever to 
support the eec hormone ban and as a result we feel it necessary 
to protect us trade interests he said 
the meat ban was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 but the 
trading bloc agreed to delay it for a year it has since refused 
american appeals for yet another postponement 
the meat imports represent a small portion of the estimated 166 
billion in trade between the united states and the common market 
in retaliation for the meat ban the united states on sunday 
imposed 100 percent duties on boneless beef pork hams and 
shoulders prepared or preserved tomatoes instant coffee fermented 
alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol by 
volume certain fruit juices and certain packaged pet food made 
from grains the sanctions are worth about 100 million 
the common market has filed a complaint with the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade to protest the us sanctions the 
96nation gatt is both an agreement and a forum for ensuring the 
free movement off goods around the world the complaint was filed in 
november before the sanctions went into effect 
holmer reiterated that the united states would like the common 
market to turn the dispute over to a special gatt panel for 
resolution but that it has so far refused to do so 
the canadian government also has not gone along with the meat 
ban australia new zealand brazil and argentina have agreed to 
ship meat from untreated cattle to europe 
eec members are france west germany italy luxembourg belgium 
the netherlands denmark greece ireland portugal spain and the 
united kingdom

home video game giant nintendo of america 
inc on thursday sued atari games inc and its wholly owned 
subsidiary tengen inc accusing the two companies of violating a 
licensing agreement 
the actions follow a lawsuit filed in middecember by atari games 
that alleged nintendo was violating antimonopoly laws that suit 
which sought 100 million in damages said nintendo was limiting the 
number of games it manufactures under licensing agreements with 
software developers and preventing them from making the games 
independently 
nintendo which is based in this seattle suburb and controls 80 
percent of the us market for home video game machines said 
thursday it had terminated its licensing agreement with tengen 
under which tengen had developed and marketed video games to be run 
on the popular nintendo entertainment system 
atari games of milpitas calif was founded in 1985 as a 
privately held company and is not affiliated with atari inc of 
sunnyvale calif the publicly held computer manufacturer 
atari games spokesman david ellis said tengen produces home 
versions of atari games arcade games including pacman and rbi 
baseball 
nintendos lawsuit filed in us district court in san 
francisco accuses tengen of breach of contract violation of 
federal and state trademark laws and unfair competition it also 
alleges atari games conspired with and aided tengens violations of 
nintendos rights interfered with nintendos license with tengen 
and engaged in activities that violate the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organization act 
tengen recently announced it would independently manufacture and 
distribute certain games for the nintendo system that previously 
were produced under license from nintendo 
ellis said the legal staff of atari games was reviewing the 
lawsuit and that it would be premature to comment on its specifics 
however he said as far as we know we have not breached any 
agreements whatsoever 
by terminating its agreement with tengen nintendo said tengen 
will no longer receive marketing benefits available to nintendo 
licensees including promotion in nintendo publications nationwide 
merchandising services and game play advice and support from 
nintendos telephone game counselors 
ellis said tengen games are sold in 12000 retail outlets 
nationwide and that the company has its own game support staff 
nintendo also said it would vigorously defend itself against 
atari games suit 
atari games alleged in its suit that it had lost between 30 
million and 35 million because it was required to rely on nintendo 
for manufacturing its games and was limited in the number of game 
cartridges it could sell the company said nintendo equipped its 
machines with a computer chip that works only with video game 
cartridges with a compatible chip 
howard lincoln nintendos senior vice president said nintendo 
and all of its licensees have been suffering from a worldwide 
computer chip shortage which has required nintendo to allocate 
chips among all its licensees including tengen 
nintendo of america which had an estimated 17 billion in sales 
in 1988 more than double its 1987 sales of 800 million is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of nintendo co ltd of kyoto japan 
ellis said tengen had sales of about 35 million in 1988 while 
sales for the privately held atari games were not available
