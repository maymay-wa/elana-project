senators approved a 141billion 
deficitreduction package friday night after junking extraneous tax 
breaks and spending increases and postponing a showdown on 
president bushs proposed cut in capitalgains taxes 
the 877 vote sent the plan to the house which earlier passed a 
version that includes a capitalgains reduction negotiators from 
the house and senate are expected to try to work out a compromise 
starting next week 
the legislation is designed to push the estimated deficit for 
the 1990 fiscal year which began oct 1 slightly below 110 
billion and avoid automatic almost acrosstheboard cuts in most 
federal spending programs on monday 
with the house not in session until monday it appeared all but 
certain that the cuts would be triggered temporarily but the 
reductions can be restored later 
the way for final senate action on the bill was cleared when 
senators approved by voice vote an agreement to strip from the bill 
hundreds of provisions prized by one member or another but which 
did nothing to cut the deficit 
stripping the bill of pet projects asks sacrifice and 
discipline of every senator majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine said in urging approval of the agreement 
the american people recognize responsibility when they see 
it said republican leader bob dole of kansas and tonight they 
are seeing responsibility in action 
among provisions dropped from the bill extension of the 3 
percent tax on local and longdistance telephone service due to 
expire at the end of 1990 new tax credits for lowincome families 
extension of tax benefits for firsttime homebuyers and workers who 
receive education and legal aid from their employers dozens of 
narrowly targeted tax cuts improvements in medicare medicaid and 
childwelfare programs and overhaul of the formula for government 
reimbursement of doctors 
we think this is absolutely the best approach sen pete 
domenici of new mexico senior republican on the senate budget 
committee said of the agreement to strip all but bare essentials 
from the bill we get good government in the fairdeal sense 
it is a very major step said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the finance committee 
voting against the bill were sens alan dixon dill howell 
heflin dala jesse helms rnc ernest hollings dsc mitch 
mcconnell rky richard shelby dala and paul simon dill 
not voting were sens david boren dokla dennis deconcini 
dariz mark hatfield rore malcolm wallop rwyo pete 
wilson rcalif and tim wirth dcolo 
at the white house one official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said president bush will not likely veto the bill 
the official said that the administration was not happy with the 
turn of events but that the stripped down bill gets back to 
budget basics 
bush will continue searching for ways to get his capitalgains 
proposal through congress in other legislation the official said 
the essential part of the bill would raise taxes by about 53 
billion and cut spending by 87 billion but as the measure worked 
its way through eight committees it picked up hundreds of 
amendments to benefit farmers loggers lowincome families the 
poor the sick the oil industry and higherincome retirees 
the bill became so laden with benefits for one group or another 
that it had to include 38 billion worth of tax increases over five 
years to have enough money left over to meet deficitreduction 
targets under the agreement everything that did not cut the 
deficit would be removed from the bill 
sen bob packwood of oregon senior republican on the finance 
committee said the agreement ensures that we will have another 
tax bill very soon two or three weeks to which the 
capitalgains reduction expanded individual retirement accounts 
and any other amendment could be added 
echoing bush republicans insisted they were not giving up the 
fight to cut the tax on capital gains which are profits from the 
sale of stocks and other investments at the white house bush said 
he was troubled by democratic efforts to substitute expanded 
taxdeductible iras for the capitalgains cut which he promised 
during last years presidential campaign 
we early on took a very clearcut position on capital gains 
he said when i became president there was no doubt at all where 
i stood on this 
he refused to rule out a final compromise that might include 
both a capitalgains cut and liberalized iras 
the senate agreement was reached without concurrence from the 
house which already has passed a deficitreduction plan that 
includes a bitterly fought cut in taxes on capital gains senate 
passage of its bill would require negotiators from the two houses 
to work out a compromise between the strippeddown version and the 
house package which has its share of provisions that do nothing to 
cut the deficit 
the final compromise could include a capitalgains cut plus 
expanded taxdeductible iras for all workers or house and senate 
negotiators could agree to consider those issues as part of some 
other tax bill later this year 
senate action on deficit reduction had been delayed as democrats 
who control the chamber by a 5545 margin sought to keep a 
capitalgains cut out of the bill in the end it appeared 
democrats had won the battle because republicans could find no way 
to overcome a rule that would have required them to get 60 votes to 
add capitalgains to the legislation 
when that became clear dole and domenici offered to drop the 
issue as part of an agreement that would strip away all other 
provisions that would not cut the deficit including the democrats 
ira provision 
most of the tax increase in the senate deficitreduction plan 
would fall on corporations spending would be cut in scores of 
programs including medicare reimbursements for doctors and 
hospitals and lower deficiency payments for some crops user fees 
charged for a variety of activities such as coast guard services 
would be raised to boost revenues

east germanys communist party today ruled out 
talks with prodemocracy activists and labeled one growing 
opposition group enemies of the socialist order 
the government had promised discussions to cope with rising 
unrest and to seek the causes of a refugee exodus saying it would 
talk to representatives of all parts of society 
but in an internal communist party position paper obtained by 
the associated press party leaders warned that open and hidden 
enemies of the socialist order could create a mass movement at 
odds with the socialist government 
any association with such opposition groups would hurt the 
further development of socialism the position paper said 
the document was directed primarily at the opposition group new 
forum which has advocated free elections greater openness in 
society and a free press 
it said new forums platform was aimed at destroying the 
leadership role of the socialist society and accused the group of 
being made up of enemies of the socialist order 
on thursday the chief ideologue of the communist party kurt 
hager indicated the opposition movement would be excluded from any 
discussions about political reform 
hager promised during a visit to moscow that the east german 
government will consider changes following the departure of tens of 
thousands of citizens to the west and the most widespread public 
demonstrations since 1953 
but his reference to possible talks with public organizations 
church groups and other social forces did not appear to include the 
opposition movement 
he said those challenging the foundations of socialism would 
have no role in the talks 
if they want to question our social order then thats not a 
basis for discussions said hager who was in moscow for the 
opening of a cultural exhibition 
the communist government here routinely has accused the major 
opposition groups of trying to undermine socialism 
the future of hardline leader erich honecker meanwhile 
remained a subject of widespread speculation party sources have 
said influential members of the ruling politburo were upset over 
the way the 77yearold honecker has responded to the unrest 
party sources said he had been asked to provide a report on the 
critical situation of the nation before the end of this week 
west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper quoting 
unidentified communist party sources reported thursday that 
honecker would be replaced on oct 18 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev visited east berlin over 
the weekend to help east germany celebrate its 40th anniversary and 
urged honecker to undertake reforms 
tens of thousands of east germans demonstrated in several cities 
and demanded political and economic reform many asked the 
reformminded gorbachev for his help 
lutheran church sources in east berlin said late thursday that 
officials in leipzig were preparing to give amnesty to all those 
arrested in protests there since sept 11 the number was not 
immediately known but up to 500 people are believed still to be in 
jail 
the politburo promised wednesday to examine the causes of the 
protests and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of young 
skilled east germans to the west 
opposition leaders thursday said they were skeptical about the 
governments professed willingness to enter into real dialogue with 
any social forces 
baerbel bohley an east berlin painter and a cofounder of the 
opposition group new forum described the politburo statement as a 
verbal shift that does not take into account real life 
east german leaders have made it clear that any changes would 
occur only within the framework of the existing socialist system 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
welcomed the east german offer of a dialogue but said it should 
be meaningful and not just a tactical move to relieve domestic and 
international pressure 
west german chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf 
seiters said kohl was optimistic 
this could be the first positive signal to the populace that 
the east german leadership has given seiters said of the 
politburo statement but we must wait to see what concrete 
measures it carries 
the government in east berlin has rejected prodemocracy reforms 
like those taking place in the soviet bloc countries of poland and 
hungary

president bush said today he will allow a 
newly approved ban on flagburning to become law without his 
signature but i dont think its enough he vowed to continue 
pressing for a constitutional amendment 
during an appearance in the white house briefing room the 
president said he was withholding his signature from the 
congressional legislation to signal our belief that a 
constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting 
protection for the flag 
bush commented on the flag legislation in a brief opening 
statement before responding to questions on other issues 
when congress is in session legislation can become law 
automatically if the president does not act on it within 10 working 
days of when it is sent to the white house after congress has 
adjourned a president can pocketveto bills by refusing to sign 
them 
i believe the american flag is a unique and special symbol of 
our nation and it should be protected from desecration and our 
administration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protect 
the flag bush said in his statement 
he proposed the amendment after the supreme court ruled last 
june that flagburning was a constitutionally protected form of 
free speech 
the court ruling brought a flood of calls for an amendment to 
the constitution but after the initial response many members of 
congress including the democratic leadership began looking for a 
way to deal with the problem through legislation rather than 
changing the constitution 
when asked if he were concerned about the political consequences 
of vetoing flagburning legislation in the light of his attacks on 
democrat michael dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign bush 
denied that was a consideration in his decision 
during the campaign bush and his supporters repeatedly attacked 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts for vetoing legislation 
that would have required public schools teachers in the state to 
lead pupils in daily recitations of the pledge of allegiance 
bush said the congressional vote was an overwhelming 
expression on the part of the congress to do something about the 
protection of the flag i dont think its enough 
i can understand the rationale of those who voted for the 
legislation but in my view it is not the ultimate answer he 
said 
the house voted 31743 thursday to complete congressional action 
on the bill 
supporting the bill were 154 republicans and 217 democrats 
while it was opposed by 25 democrats and 18 republicans 
the measure requires up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine for 
anyone who knowingly mutilates defaces physically defiles 
burns maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any flag 
of the united states 
the lopsided approval margin reflected the power of the flag as 
a political symbol as demonstrated in last years presidential 
campaign and by the outcry over the supreme courts june decision 
overturning a texas flagburning conviction 
the court reversed the conviction of texas flagburner gregory 
lee johnson on grounds the law violated his right to freedom of 
speech 
bush contends a constitutional amendment would settle the issue 
once and for all and could not be overturned by a court such a 
measure is set to come before the senate next week 
house minority leader bob michel rill told reporters that 
someone at the white house he did not recall the name told him 
the president might stress his dislike of the bill while bowing to 
its popularity by letting it become law without his signature 
soon afterward white house sources said bush was likely to 
follow that course he could do that by allowing the measure to sit 
untouched after it reached his desk for 10 days while congress 
remained in session the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
fitzwater traveling with bush in new york declined to say what 
the president might do well have to have a legal review take 
place when the bill arrives at the white house he said 
congressional democrats declaring that constitutional 
amendments should be used only as a last resort said their bill 
was so carefully worded that it probably could survive a court 
challenge 
it is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flag 
rather than any action that the message might convey that is to be 
punished said house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks 
dtexas 
he said the idea was to make flag defacement illegal regardless 
of whether it had anything to do with political protest and to make 
the statute content neutral 
michel scoffed at that notion however saying there was no way 
to draw up such a bill 
to those who believe we can overturn a supreme court decision 
at this time by statute i can only repeat the immortal words of 
the farmer who asked directions said you cant get there from 
here michel told the house 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he hoped the senate 
would to block the proposed constitutional amendment next week 
i think the amendment would be extremely illadvised foley 
said i dont believe we should rush into any action that would 
amend the first amendment without the greatest care and obviously 
it would be i think reckless to do so i think at this point

armed civilians kidnapped a swiss flight 
attendant in northern lebanon early this week and freed her today 
security sources said police here could not confirm the abduction 
in bern switzerland on thursday foreign ministry spokesman 
clemens birrer said the woman whom he refused to identify was 
kidnapped by gunmen in northern lebanon on sunday 
a reliable lebanon security source speaking on condition of 
anonymity identified the woman as astrid fischer 31 and said she 
was was released in tripoli this afternoon 
the source said gunmen kidnapped ms fischer from a house in the 
village of koubbaa 31 miles north of beirut on sunday birrer had 
said the kidnapping occurred in tripoli which is 50 miles north of 
beirut 
the source refused to identify the kidnappers but said the 
woman a flight attendant with swissair was interrogated in 
connection with her activities and stay in lebanon 
he refused to elaborate 
the abduction would be the third of a swiss national in lebanon 
in a week the two previous kidnappings were linked to the case of 
a shiite moslem militant serving a life sentence in switzerland for 
hijacking a jet 
when asked about the latest reported kidnapping tripoli police 
chief col nabil zein said today i have no information at all 
about this kidnapping we have neither a notification nor a 
complaint about such a kidnapping 
i read the report from bern in the papers this morning he 
told the associated press when contacted by telephone 
birrer said the womans parents asked authorities not to 
publicize the case he told reporters of the kidnapping after being 
asked about unattributed news reports of it 
there is no sign of a political background to this 
kidnapping he added 
switzerland asked syria which controls much of northern 
lebanon to help find the woman he said 
in all 19 westerners are missing in lebanon including eight 
americans the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
shiite moslems loyal to iran are thought to be holding most of 
the hostages 
on oct 6 two swiss red cross workers elio erriquez and 
emmanual christen were abducted in southern lebanon no group 
claimed responsibility for the kidnappings and no demands have 
been made 
later that day a plo spokesman blamed radical palestinian 
guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind abu nidal for those 
abductions and linked them to a shiite moslem militant mohammed 
hariri he is serving a life sentence in switzerland for hijacking 
an air afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a french passenger 
lebanese police also blamed abu nidals group for the oct 6 
abductions the abu nidal organization denied involvement 
birrer said he did not believe there was any connection between 
the kidnappings oct 6 and that reported thursday 
all swiss red cross personnel were withdrawn from lebanon 
following the kidnapping in november of peter winkler a relief 
worker in sidon winkler was released a month later and the swiss 
contingent returned after receiving assurances from all sides in 
lebanon that humanitarian workers would not be targeted for 
kidnappings

president bush said today he opposes allowing 
medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest but held out hope 
a congressional compromise could be worked out that would avoid a 
veto on my part 
at a morning news conference bush repeatedly insisted he has 
not wavered in his opposition to a provision passed by the house on 
wednesday and earlier by the senate that would drop a decadelong 
ban on federally funded abortions for poor women who are victims of 
rape or incest 
but bush said house and senate negotiators working out different 
versions of the broader legislation could produce room for 
flexibility 
im not looking for any conflict over this im not going to 
change my position any bush said but lets see how these 
negotiations come out and well start discussing that today but i 
have not changed my position 
asked if he was leaving open the question of whether he would 
veto the legislation as passed by the house bush said well 
because im told that the conference language may be able to avoid 
a veto on my part 
house republican leader bob michel said thursday that there 
might be room for a compromise if both sides could agree to a 
provision permitting medicaid abortions when the rape or incest 
victim reported that act within 48 hours of its occurrence 
bush commented a day after democratic leaders in congress 
conceded they could not override a bush veto of the bill and 
pleaded with him to reconsider 
the president has the power to deny an opportunity for poor 
women to make a choice in their tragic circumstances said house 
speaker tom foley dwash 
the presidents position is wrong said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine it is harsh terribly harsh 
on the poorest most vulnerable american women 
in an outcome that surprised even the victors the house voted 
216206 to permit use of federal money to terminate pregnancies for 
poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who report it 
promptly to authorities 
the provision would revise current law permitting medicaid 
abortions only in cases where a womans life was endangered by 
pregnancy and she could not afford to pay for an abortion 
it is part of a 1567 billion measure to finance labor health 
and education programs for fiscal 1990 that has already been 
approved by the senate but remains subject to final agreement on 
unrelated issues 
not only is this a reflection of the majority position of the 
house of representatives democrat and republican and the united 
states senate but the american people as well foley said 
joining mitchell at a press conference to appeal to bush 
this is a plea to the president to reconsider mitchell 
said the votes are not there in the house to override the veto 
therefore he holds it in his power 
bush has been dogged by political controversy on the abortion 
issue for a decade and some antiabortion groups have questioned 
his commitment to their side 
as a candidate for president in 1980 before becoming ronald 
reagans running mate bush took the view that there should be 
three circumstances permitting abortion rape incest and the 
threatened life of the mother 
he muted those views after joining reagans ticket but once he 
started running for president again bush made statements that 
suggested his position was shifting again 
in an appearance oct 7 1987 at an iowa high school bush told 
a student who questioned him that while he opposes abortion i 
would make the exception rape incest and the life of the 
mother 
the provision passed by the house is narrowly drawn permitting 
funding for abortions when the victims report the rape or incest 
promptly 
experts said the change might affect only a small number of 
cases but it was widely viewed as a symbolic victory for 
supporters of abortion rights 
it came as abortion rights forces were benefiting from an 
apparently shifting political climate on abortion since the supreme 
courts ruling in july that ruling allowed increased state 
regulation of abortions and abortion rights forces say it 
politically energized those on their side of the issue 
the house vote came on the same day abortion rights groups 
enjoyed a symbolic victory in florida the state legislature in a 
special session called by republican gov bob martinez rejected 
all the governors proposed abortion restrictions 
certainly florida and the vote yesterday in congress are 
reflective of a new political movement said kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
the climate is changing

civil rights leaders are demanding that the rev 
ralph david abernathy retract implications in his new book that the 
rev martin luther king jr had sexual encounters with women on the 
night before he was killed 
a memphis tenn woman said in an interview published today 
that she was with abernathy and king that night and she disputed 
part of the account in abernathys autobiography and the walls 
came tumbling down 
in his book published this month kings onetime top aide says 
king spent parts of the night before his death alone with two 
different women and physically fought with a third 
abernathy wrote that he awoke from a nap in a womans living 
room after a latenight dinner to see king and the woman emerge 
from a bedroom adjua abi naantaanbuu told the commercial appeal in 
memphis that she was host of the dinner and that she and her sister 
talked with king and another aide in the living room while 
abernathy who had too many drinks slept on her bed 
in an interview published today in the atlanta 
journalconstitution abernathy rejected suggestions by some of the 
civil rights leaders that two strokes and brain surgery might have 
impaired his memory i am most surprised anybody would think im 
mentally incompetent abernathy said 
abernathy has said that he did not include passages about kings 
extramarital affairs out of malice but felt he needed to address 
the issue since it had been discussed in previous biographies of 
the nobel peace prize winner 
i loved martin luther king more than a brother i would never 
do it to injure him abernathy said 
a coalition of black leaders including jesse jackson and andrew 
young said thursday they objected to the controversial passages and 
doubted that abernathy wrote them a spokesman for the books 
publisher replied that the whole book was written solely by the 
atlanta minister 
the groups statement concluded that the memphis section of 
abernathys book was so out of character with abernathys life and 
previous statements that it must have been put into your mouth by 
others who needed a sensational story to sell books and slander the 
name of your martyred brother 
steve sorrentino a spokesman for harper amp row in new york said 
the allegations are untrue 
the book is entirely abernathys words there was no 
cowriter no ghost writer sorrentino said he stands by 
everything he says in the book i wonder if all the people sitting 
back criticizing now have read the book 
the book is not a sensationalized put down martin luther 
king book sorrentino said he reveres martin luther king and 
takes two pages to address what everyone has talked about before 
he wanted to address it and be honest about it 
abernathy appearing to promote the book thursday in memphis 
tenn where king was slain april 4 1968 said he was surprised 
by the uproar 
im not judas he told reporters i know who i am im a 
christian minister 
jesse hill chairman of the board of the king center in atlanta 
said a number of civil rights leaders including jackson young 
naacp chief benjamin hooks and southern christian leadership 
conference president joseph lowery sent abernathy a telegram 
sunday calling on him to repudiate his writings 
we take particular exception to your personal reconstruction 
of martins last hours on this earth said the telegram read to 
reporters by hill at a news conference in front of kings tomb at 
the king center 
the ralph we know and love would not have written this 
section we deplore the fact that for this account if it is 
not repudiated will rob you of your rightful place in history 
jackson issued a statement that the character of kings work 
would stand when all the dust clears 
dr king cannot speak for himself the statement said 
those of us who appreciate dr kings work will stand with him 
through every challenge 
hooks in a statement released from naacp headquarters in 
baltimore said he had read the book and was deeply saddened and 
distressed that abernathy would succumb to the temptation to 
desecrate kings memory 
king center officials said kings widow coretta scott king 
president of the center would have no statement other than to 
endorse that made by hill the centers board chairman 
john hurst adams an african methodist episcopal church bishop 
said young jackson hooks and former king aide bernard lee all of 
whom were in memphis with king on his final days have sharply 
different recollections of the events of those days

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference friday 
i have a statement id like to make and then some time 
constraints be glad to answer a few questions 
i believe that the american flag is a unique and special symbol 
of our nation and it should be protected from desecration and our 
administration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protect 
the flag because we believe that is the most the most lasting and 
legally correct means of protection a constitutional amendment 
and yesterday the house of representatives agreed to a senate 
bill providing statutory protection for the flag and when this 
measure comes to the house i will allow the bill to become law 
but without my signature and i am withholding that signature to 
signal our belief that a constitutional amendment is the best way 
to provide lasting protection for the flag 
we will continue to work for such an amendment and i can 
understand the rationale of those who voted for this legislation 
but in my view it is not the ultimate answer and therefore i will 
not put my signature on the legislation 
i would now be glad to take questions all of which i am sure 
will be on the flag 
q sorry to disappoint you mr president you have said on 
several occasions that you knew everything at the time of the 
panamanian coup and you didnt feel that there were any really 
problems in retrospective at the same time there are many reports 
that youve changed the rules of procedure on handling on crisis 
management and that you have asked the hill for more authority to 
operate during a coup or plan a coup or whatever can you 
straighten this out for us and 
a let me help you out 
q obviously there were glitches or you wouldnt have spent two 
weeks trying to defend yourself i mean the administration 
a well im not sure i agree to the last part 
q you have spent two weeks trying to explain to the american 
people what you did 
a no this is the first chance shot ive had at explaining 
q not you per se but your administration 
a oh i see no i what was the first part of the question 
q that you have changed the procedures on crisis management 
and 
a no look heres what its coming back here is my 
position i have not seen any fact in all the reports that have 
come out that would make me have done something different in terms 
of use of force and i reiterate that now in terms of procedures 
ill simply say any time we can make improvements so much the 
better but there has not been an intelligence gap that would have 
made me act in a different way and so and i repeat that 
and theres been endless interviews and discussions and stories 
many of which are false that come out as to what we were asked to 
do or not to do but ive seen no fact that would make me change my 
view and ive seen allegations that we had if when i said i 
wanted noriega to get out there that implied use of force i hope 
i would never be reckless enough as a commanderinchief to make a 
blanket commitment to use of force if without knowing the facts 
regarding some coup attempt 
we want to see mr noriega out ill repeat that ive been very 
heartened by the reports from various leaders in our hemisphere 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
about what noriega should do so but i dont see any serious 
disconnects at all and if we can fine tune our crisis management 
system so much the better and i think thats what youre reading 
about now

a syrian pilot who landed his plane in 
israel said today he defected because he wanted to live in a 
democracy and would refuse any offer by the red cross to return him 
to syria 
syria has denied the pilot was a defector and asked the red 
cross to intervene 
maj mohammed bassam adel refused to answer most political 
questions at a news conference arranged by the israeli army but he 
said syrian pilots considered israels air force superior to their 
own 
he recounted how he flew across the border at high speed and as 
low as 30 yards off the ground going into the unknown in 
search of freedom and a place to land 
he said he made the decision to defect on his own for personal 
reasons and had no contact with anyone in israel before he piloted 
his sovietbuilt mig23 over the golan heights from syria on 
wednesday 
i decided to cross the border in electronic silence he 
said i was not in contact with anyone nobody was expecting me 
it was a difficult mission i didnt know where i was going to 
land i didnt know if i would find a facility to land i was going 
into the unknown the 34yearold flier told israeli and foreign 
reporters 
much has been made in israel over how adel crossed the border 
without being intercepted although he reporedly was in israeli air 
space for seven minutes before landing 
the section i was crossing was spread all over with 
missiles the short wiry pilot said i crossed at very low 
altitude and very high speed 
when asked to be specific adel said he flew at 700 to 750 mph 
and below 50 meters yards sometimes 30 meters sometimes 40 
adel who was dressed in an olive green flight suit spoke in 
arabic and his words were translated into english by israeli 
officers the news conference was held at a military base near tel 
aviv 
the pilot said he defected in search of freedom 
i wanted to live in a democracy where people can express their 
views with freedom he explained 
asked to comment on syrian politics he repeated his desire for 
freedom and added that by implication you can presume my thoughts 
about the political system in syria 
adel was asked whether he would see a representative of the 
international committee of the red cross as syria has requested 
if the red cross wants to meet me and take me back to syria i 
would refuse this he said 
asked if he hoped to remain in israel he said i said i 
wanted to live in a democracy so you might conclude i want to 
live here 
however he said he had made no definite decisions about his 
future 
adel would say little about the mig23 he piloted across the 
golan heights to a civilian airstrip near megiddo 57 miles north 
of jerusalem in northern israel nor would he compare it to other 
syrian air force planes 
he also refused to discuss his family and whether he was 
discriminated against because of his sunni moslem religion in a 
country where the president hafez assad and many military leaders 
belong to the minority alawite sect 
adel said he received gentle treatment from the israelis 
was asked mainly about his reasons for defecting and had not yet 
been questioned about the syrian air force 
when asked if syrian pilots felt they had gained superiority 
over israel he replied no one in the syrian air force feels 
that they could defeat israel that they are superior to israel 
adel said he was born in the syrian town of aleppo and was a 
graduate of syrias air force academy he said he decided a long 
time ago to defect and had been planning it seriously for three 
to four months

a fire in a bustling chinatown neighborhood 
detonated 2000 pounds of illegally stored fireworks destroyed one 
building and injured 17 people officials said 
the fire which broke out about noon in a building that had a 
small grocery store on the ground floor was controlled at 5 pm 
but pieces of the building continued to smolder this morning 
firefighters worked to finish tearing down the sixstory brick 
building to prevent it from collapsing 
the blaze spread to two adjoining buildings igniting as many as 
29 explosions in fireworks stored illegally in one of the buildings 
and forcing some of the 200 firefighters to evacuate said fire 
commissioner leo stapleton 
im very distrubed about that stapleton said we could 
have lost a lot of firefighters there 
of the 17 people injured 13 were were treated at the scene for 
minor injuries three were treated at area hospitals and released 
and one a firefighter was hospitalized in stable condition 
suffering from smoke inhalation spokesmen said 
the fire broke out just before noon in the compact and congested 
neighborhood of asian restaurants bakeries apartments and small 
businesses casting a pall of thick black and gray smoke over the 
citys skyline 
the fire appeared to have started on the ground floor of the 
sixstory building where there were reports that workers might 
have been using welding equipment or cutting torches stapleton 
said the cause remained under investigation and preliminary 
estimates put the damage at 2 million he said 
damage estimates for the two other buildings were incomplete 
early today 
within the last month city officials had ordered the stoppage of 
illegal construction work at the building where the fire started 
said fire lt joseph mcdonnell 
firefighters had trouble getting adequate pressure in their 
hoses said deputy fire chief paul christian he said he was unsure 
if more pressure might have saved the sixstory building but he 
said it might have enabled firefighters to keep the flames from 
spreading 
officials from the boston water and sewer commission said two 
valves under the street had been closed possibly by a contractor 
doing work in the area

prime minister gro harlem brundtland 
resigned today yielding the government to a threeparty 
nonsocialist coalition after 3 tough years of minority rule 
conservative party chairman jan p syse 58 will become prime 
minister on monday mrs brundtland remains until then as caretaker 
mrs brundtlands resignation followed a loss by her labor party 
of eight parliament seats in the sept 11 election the party fell 
to 63 seats in the expanded 165member storting 
the 50yearold prime minister helped topple the same 
conservativeled alliance in 1986 and some analysts predict her 
return to power within a year 
mrs brundtland presented her resignation to king olav v today 
and referred the monarch to syse about a new government 
syse an attorney will polish his coalition of the 
conservative christian democratic and center parties and assign 
cabinet posts this weekend 
i can assure you the government will be ready at the right 
time syse said after seeing the king 
the new coalition controls 62 seats it had the support of the 
extreme right 22seat party of progress in its threat to evict 
labor in a noconfidence vote unless mrs brundtland stepped down 
labors ally the socialist left has 17 seats and there is one 
independent 
mrs brundtland is best known abroad as head of the un 
commission on the environment and developement in opposition she 
is expected to chair parliaments foreign affairs committee 
the coalitions position is tenuous the antitax progress party 
has said it wont guarantee support since the coalition refused to 
make it a partner 
they wont last more than a year predicted william 
lafferty an american political scientist who has lived in norway 
for 22 years 
gunnar vogt of the institute for social research said syse may 
even turn to labor to support some of his programs to avoid being 
held to ransom by the extremist parties 
its anyones guess whether the coalition can last until 
elections in 1993 vogt said in an interview 
norway has no mechanism for early elections and if syse cant 
hold his partnership together mrs brundtland probably would move 
back into the prime ministers office 
mrs brundtland was credited for helping to cut inflation in 
half turn a trade deficit into a surplus and slow consumer 
spending but she left the country with postwar record unemployment 
of 5 percent

the us chief of naval operations says soviet 
arms control proposals would place undue restrictions on the navys 
ability to protect american interests and deter aggression 
adm carlisle trost the first chief of a us military service 
to visit the soviet union made the comments thursday in a speech 
to the leningrad naval school a text of his remarks was made 
available to the associated press 
the navys top man noted with some amusement that he was 
spending today the 214th anniversary of the founding of the us 
navy here in the soviet union visiting ships in your fleet 
meeting officers and men in your navy 
i think that my being here marks a milestone in the progress 
that our two countries have made in just the past few years toward 
improving bilateral relations and easing some of the tension that 
has characterized our dialogue for the past four decades trost 
said 
but the admiral had few kind words to say about soviet proposals 
to limit us naval power around the world 
trost mentioned proposals from the warsaw pact and others that 
would exclude antisubmarine forces from certain security zones 
exclude all naval force activity from certain strategic straits and 
high density shipping lanes limit naval exercises or place 
restrictions on the movement of ships with nuclearcapable weapons 
any one of these would result in the inability of my navy to 
protect the global interests of the united states or to deter 
aggression navy forces must be free to operate when and where 
deterrent presence is required and operate unimpeded by 
restrictive sanctions trost said 
trost said he also opposed any restrictions on the use of 
sealaunched cruise missiles calling compliance with any such 
limitations unverifiable without unacceptably intrusive 
inspections 
the admiral contended the united states is dependent upon 
overseas trade for its economic wellbeing whereas seaborne 
trade for the soviet union is not a matter of national survival 
when viewed from this perspective i strongly feel that my 
countrys reluctance to enter into naval arms reductions is 
justified by the facts and is a prudent and rational position 
the admiral said 
trost also dismissed soviet calls for limits on the 14 us 
aircraft carriers that ply the high seas calling them the 
backbone of the navy and a useful tool for deterring wouldbe 
aggressors 
trost noted that when former soviet military chief sergei 
akhromeyev visited the united states he said the us navy and its 
bases threaten the security of the soviet union 
but trost said the us strategy is not intended to threaten 
anyone us military forces are only a threat to someone who 
would intend to threaten our interests or those of our allies he 
said

anymore said henry mcclellan a vice president at holmes 
community college who has been a board member of the east holmes 
academy for two years he did not elaborate 
the resignations and walkout by the players followed 
confirmation by east holmes headmaster frank drake that the school 
would not play columbus heritage academy which has the first black 
player in north central aa conference history 
drake one of the schools founders said earlier this week that 
race had nothing to do with the decision he said the action 
involved something private that he could not discuss 
but several questioned his decision 
its a racial thing no question about it said steve frank 
whose son was a starting tackle and linebacker before quitting the 
team wednesday 
drake refused thursday to answer additional questions about the 
decision 
a broadcaster also said thursday in jackson that former national 
football league player glen collins was banned from broadcasting a 
game at east holmes because he is black

frank janous another east holmes school board member said he 
sent a letter of resignation last friday after serving on the 
governing panel for more than 10 years 
asked why he resigned janous said i dont want to say i 
think you probably know 
among the seven atheletes who quit were four starters in 
tonights game against grenada kirk academy east holmes has 17

president bush reflecting on the failed coup 
against manuel antonio noriega said today he still hopes to see 
panamas leader ousted and brought to justice and added i 
wouldnt mind using force if it could be done in a prudent manner 
at a midmorning news conference in the white house bush said 
he opposes housepassed legislation providing federal funds for 
abortions for poor women who are victims of incest or rape but the 
president said he hoped compromise language would make it possible 
to avoid a veto of the politically charged legislation 
on another controversial subject bush said he would permit 
legislation banning flag burning to become law without his 
signature he said the legislation wasnt the ultimate answer 
and urged a constitutional amendment to do the same thing 
bush signaled his desire for flexibility on other issues as 
well including democratic calls for expanded individual retirement 
accounts and legislation to repeal catastrophic health care for the 
elderly 
but there was no give on his defense of his muchcriticized 
handling of the failed coup attempt in panama two weeks ago when 
us troops stationed nearby were not directed to intervene on 
behalf the rebels 
i would hope i would never be reckless enough as 
commanderinchief to make a commitment to force without knowing 
the facts of a coup attempt he said hed seen no evidence of a 
crucial gap in intelligence 
i wouldnt mind using force if it could be done in a prudent 
manner he said in defending the decision not to take part in the 
coup so im not ruling out the use of force for all time 
while saying he would not change his decision against using 
force bush acknowledged complaints about poor communication and 
other problems by the united states he said they were well worth 
looking into and that he was not opposed to finetuning his 
crisismanagement system 
he hinted broadly he might seek congressional approval for 
greater authority in dealing with situations like the coup in 
panama we may we may he said i want as broad a power as 
possible and i think under the constitution the president has it 
bush continued his defense even as he was walking out of the 
briefing room 
i can understand instant hawks appearing from where there used 
to be the feathers of a dove because some of it is political and 
some of it is the frustration they feel because this man noriega 
is still in office he said 
bush also urged congress to approve his plan for a cut in the 
capital gains tax and said he would consider signing legislation 
that combined his plan with a democratic proposal liberalizing 
individual retirement accounts 
the mixing of iras and capital gains in this debate is 
troublesome to me bush said whether there is room for 
compromise on that id leave it to those who are negotiating 
most of the attention during the questionandanswer session was 
focused on noriega 
the panamanian leader is under indictment in the united states 
for drug trafficking and the president said hes not willing to 
have the indictment dropped in exchange for noriega giving up power 
he blended his call for noriegas ouster with his defense of his 
own actions two weeks ago 
i am not going to give carte blanche support for an operation 
particularly when they dont ask for that support he said i 
have to reserve that right i have at stake the lives of american 
kids 
bush brushed aside critics who said he missed an opportunity to 
assist in noriegas ouster in the failed coup 
ive seen no fact that would make me change my view he said 
on the flag legislation the president said i will allow the 
bill to become law but without my signature i am withholding that 
signature to signal our belief that the constitutional amendment is 
the best way to provide protection for the flag 
asked about attempts in congress to repeal catastrophic health 
care legislation for the elderly bush said he was letting the 
congressional process hash this out 
bush was asked repeatedly about the volatile abortion issue and 
said he hoped he could avoid a veto of legislation that calls for 
medicaid funding for abortions for poor women who are victims of 
rape and incest 
im not looking for any conflict over this he said 
my position is well known and well stated and right now there 
is some negotiations and discussion going on said bush aides 
have suggested bush would likely veto the bill if the house version 
is embraced in the senate 
he said he wanted to see if there is room for flexibility 
the house has passed the provision and sent it to the senate 
which approved similar provision a year ago and is expected to do 
so again the conference language may be able to avoid a veto on 
my part

the pope today celebrated the final mass 
of his indonesian tour and urged catholics here to be bold in 
proclaiming christian values in this predominantly moslem nation 
the pontiff stressed themes of family and social teaching at his 
final stops but also acknowledged difficulties facing the church in 
indonesia 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro gave a positive summation of 
the trip saying no obstacles had been placed before the pope and 
that he spoke with absolute freedom 
but the pontiff again used guarded language when referring to 
potential conflicts with the government or moslem community 
his last mass here was attended by 100000 people amid lush 
coffee and palm oil plantations in north sumatra 
in a speech to the countrys 42 bishops later in jakarta john 
paul urged catholics to be bold in proclaiming their christian 
values he acknowledged occasional difficulties facing his 5 
millionmember flock but reminded them that religious freedom is 
protected by the constitution 
there are 157 million moslems in indonesia 
do not be afraid to encourage the catholic people to be an 
ever more public witness to the truths and values of their faith 
in keeping with their rightful place in the society of which they 
are worthy citizens he told the bishops 
raising another delicate issue the pope said you are 
sometimes painfully aware that certain traditional practices and 
other contemporary social influences bring about an obscuring of 
fundamental principles regarding family life and the responsible 
transmission of life 
he did not elaborate but was apparently referring to polygamy 
and the governments aggressive birth control program the church 
bars artificial birth control 
the church as well as the government here is concerned about 
increasing pressure from moslem extremists 
the moslem influence is reflected in two proposed laws before 
parliament one would make islamic religious teaching mandatory in 
all schools including catholic ones and the other would set up 
islamic courts for marriages wills and inheritances 
the only trouble during the popes stay occurred thursday in 
east timor when youths opposed to indonesian rule of the former 
portuguese colony clashed with police at the end of the papal mass 
they held up banners greeting the pope in the name of an 
antiindonesian guerrilla group 
navarro said john paul watched the incident calmly and made no 
mention of it afterward 
the pope is scheduled to leave saturday for the indian ocean 
island nation of mauritius he returns to rome on monday

inaugurate us air mail delivery fetched 11 million at an 
auction the highest price ever paid for a stamp collectors item 
officials said 
the airplane depicted on the stamps was inadvertently printed 
upside down 
the stamps considered the finest philatelic item in the united 
states are called curtiss jenny because the airplane shown is 
a model curtiss jn6 which carried the first air mail deliveries 
said scott trepel of christies auction house 
christies which handled the sale identified the buyer at 
thursdays auction only as an american broadcast executive 
the stamps were uncanceled and included a border bearing the 
fourdigit number of the plate used to print the stamps 
another block of four curtiss jenny stamps that did not include 
the plate number sold for 528000 
the original sheet bearing 100 curtiss jenny stamps was bought 
for 24 in 1918 in a washington dc post office by a private 
collector 
the curtiss jenny stamps and other philatelic items sold at 
christies were from the collection of raymond weill 74 and his 
brother roger 78 renowned stamp dealers who have run a stamp 
shop in the french quarter of new orleans since 1932 
the 342 lots auctioned went for a total of 429 million 
another big seller was a block of four us stamps bearing a 
picture of a car that inadvertently was printed upside down 
the stamps issued in 1901 to commemorate the opening of the 
panamerican exposition in buffalo ny sold for 203500 trepel 
said 
among the other items sold was a telegram cover with a pony 
express insignia which went for 99000 the telegram was sent in 
1860 from the east coast to san francisco but since the telegraph

several black general motors corp workers are 
challenging a settlement of a racial descrimination lawsuit against 
the company saying the payout is too small 
attorneys said the settlement could cost gm 3 million 
immediately and up to 40 million over the next five years 
an appeal filed thursday with the 6th us circuit court of 
appeals in cincinnati says the case was poorly handled and the 
settlement too small 
last month us district judge john feikens approved a 
settlement of the lawsuit originally filed by four employees in 
1983 it became a class action suit three years later involving 
10000 black gm workers in michigan indiana and ohio 
the black workers claimed an employee appraisal system dropped 
by the automaker after the suit was filed resulted in lower pay 
and fewer promotions for blacks between 1982 and 1986 
gm issued a statement thursday saying the settlement was fair 
godfrey dillard an attorney who represents a group of black gm 
employees challenging the settlement said the appeal will stop 
implementation of the settlement 
dennis james an attorney who negotiated the settlement for the 
plaintiffs said the appeal would cost about 1 million a year in

a federal jury began deliberating today whether 
rep robert garcia and his wife extorted payoffs from the wedtech 
corp a defunct defense contractor 
us district judge leonard sand who instructed the jurors 
thursday afternoon told them to begin their discussions at 1030 
am 
also thursday the panel heard closing arguments from garcias 
lawyer who said the prosecution did not prove the couples guilt 
no one was paying off bobby garcia robert morvillo said 
garcia helped wedtech get government contracts because he was a 
good public official he said 
the lawyer described garcia as a dedicated and honest politician 
who rose from the ghetto to represent his neighborhood in 
washington 
bobby garcia wants nothing more than to go back to the south 
bronx and serve his constituents he said 
morvillo said the 76000 that the government contends was 
funneled by wedtech to mrs garcias consulting firm to pay for 
garcias political influence was for work unrelated to wedtech 
a 20000 loan garcia received from the company was a loan 
among friends he said 
he claimed garcia asked mario moreno the former wedtech vice 
chairman to make the loan to the congressmans sister who passed 
the money on to mrs garcia because he knew it wouldnt look right 
to take a loan from a constituent 
congress members are not required to report loans from family 
members on their financial disclosure forms morvillo said he 
noted that the loan was promptly repaid 
garcia a 56yearold democrat and his wife jane lee garcia 
are accused of conspiring to obtain 185000 in checks and 
interestfree loans and a diamond and emerald necklace for mrs 
garcia from officials of the nowdefunct wedtech corp 
the couple was charged in a sevencount indictment with 
conspiracy extortion bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities 
if convicted of extortion they face up to 20 years in prison 
their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal at 
wedtech the small south bronx machine shop that grew into a 
multimilliondollar defense contractor through various bribe 
schemes the company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of 
corruption 
morvillo attacked the credibility of moreno the governments 
key witness 
did mario moreno lie in this case yes morvillo said he 
lied about everything that would incriminate these people 
moreno pleaded guilty to theft and briberelated charges in 
1987 and testified at other wedtech trials 
in the prosecutions rebuttal which followed morvillos 
arguments assistant us attorney edward little denied the 
defenses argument that the prosecution presented a onewitness 
case 
he said 27 other witnesses and 500 documents corroborated 
morenos testimony

intelligence sources say congress is partly to 
blame for us inaction during last weeks failed panamanian coup 
because lawmakers precluded at least one covert action for which 
president bush sought clearance 
and president bush today renewed his implicit invitation for 
rebels to overthrow panamanian dictator gen manuel noriega and 
renewed the promise of us help i wouldnt mind using force if 
it could be done in a prudent manner bush said at a news 
conference so im not ruling out the use of force for all time 
members of the house intelligence committee earlier this year 
barred the bush administration from exercising certain unspecified 
options in panama that might have led to a different outcome in 
the coup according to intelligence sources who spoke thursday on 
condition of anonymity 
the reason we didnt have total information as the coup 
unfolded was because of the action of some members of the 
intelligence committee said one source 
there was interference and secondguessing when the 
administration proposed a set of actions designed to give it better 
inside knowledge of the panamanian defense forces the source said 
at his news conference bush said he has made no specific 
request of the senate and house intelligence committees since the 
coup for additional authority in panama but he added we 
might make such a request later 
i think under the constitution a president has broad 
powers broader than some in the senate or the house might think 
i want to work cooperatively with these committees 
sen william cohen of maine the senior republican on the senate 
intelligence committee said policymakers need to provide better 
guidelines as to when us personnel can become involved in a coup 
particularly when there is the possibility of assassination 
something banned under current policy 
does it follow from this prohibition that american personnel 
are confined to a purely passive role of gathering intelligence 
cohen said in a statement 
or are there circumstances in which they could provide 
information or assistance to groups seeking to overthrow 
dictatorial governments and establish democracies there appears to 
be confusion surrounding this question 
on thursday the bush administration denied noriegas allegation 
the united states paid 1 million to rebel officers to launch last 
weeks failed coup the administration contends us officials were 
notified in advance by panamanians involved in the coup but did not 
play a part in planning it 
the intelligence sources said the bush administration notified 
congress earlier this year of options involving panama in an 
intelligence finding a document required to be given to 
congress before covert actions are undertaken 
some of the loudest criticism of bushs handling of the oct 3 
coup attempt against noriega by pdf rebel officers has come from 
members of congress including senate intelligence committee 
chairman david boren dokla 
but house minority leader robert michel rill without 
mentioning names said thursday that there is plenty in the 
classified record to know that some of these people are going 
far beyond what theyve got the ight to say about the 
administrations requests in the past what was granted and what 
was denied 
one member of the house intelligence committee alluded to the 
congressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations bill 
for intelligence agencies saying bushs cautious response to the 
coup was justified in part by interference from the democratic 
congress 
who could expect this administration or any administration or 
any intelligence agencies to make gutsy decisions when we have 
lashed them put them under the whip tethered them told them they 
better not do anything said rep bud shuster rpa 
shuster noted that some on capitol hill have said bush has 
received everything he wanted with regard to panama 
and yet we know there are those who have gone to the white 
house and threatened them with exposure of classified 
information and said you dare not engage in covert 
operations shuster said 
boren said on nbc television last weekend since george bush 
became president every single word of authority that he has 
requested from the intelligence committee and every single penny 
that he has requested from the intelligence committee relating to 
panama he has gotten and he has gotten with my support 
noriega told reporters for the los angeles times and the boston 
globe that panamanian investigators discovered a bank account in 
the name of capt erick a murillo one of the alleged coup 
leaders with more than 1 million 
there was a lot of money there for a normal panamanian 
noriega was quoted as saying six zeroes it was a million dollar 
account 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday in 
gulfport miss the state department says its absurd the 
national security council says theres nothing to it and i say we 
dont believe anything noriega says 
but the long island ny newspaper newsday reported today that

prime minister margaret thatcher today 
said it has been a fantastic year for freedom but told her 
conservative party that despite this military might must not be 
allowed to lag 
she also scorned the opposition labor party for abandoning its 
policy of unilateral disarmament calling it a desperate move to 
win votes 
in a speech to the final session of the conservative partys 
fourday conference mrs thatcher also gave strong support to the 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson whose recent decision to 
boost interest rates has caused discontent within party ranks 
the torch of freedom we lit in britain all those years ago 
the symbol of our party has shed its light across the iron curtain 
into eastern europe she said 
what a fantastic year this has been for freedom 1989 will be 
remembered for decades to come as the year when the people of half 
our continent began to throw off their chains 
the prime minister turned 64 today and as she entered the 
conference hall an organist played when im 64 
despite the changes in the communist world mrs thatcher said 
the potential for conflict lurked around the world 
yes we are ready to negotiate to reduce the levels of weapons 
on both sides but only so long as it can be done without 
jeopardizing our security she said 
the opposition labor partys call for a 25 percent cut in 
defense spending she said would endanger that security and she 
scorned labors new commitment to multilateral instead of 
unilateral disarmament 
labors supposed conversion to multilateralism is no more than 
a confidence trick to try to make labor electable she said 
turning to economics mrs thatcher said she understood that 
higher interest rates worried home owners farmers and small 
businesses but when the choice is between high rates now or 
persistent higher inflation later with all the damage that would 
do the choice is clear 
inflation will come down through the use of high interest 
rates as it has in the past she said and commended lawson and 
his predecessor sir geoffrey howe as the two finest chancellors 
of the exchequer since the war 
interest rates are now at an eightyear high of 15 percent and 
will remain high in an effort to curb the 73 percent inflation 
rate lawson said thursday 
despite fears of an economic crisis and persistently poor poll 
ratings the traditionally loyal and welldiscplined party 
activists have cheered some uncompromising messages from cabinet 
ministers during the conference 
but outside the conference hall there have been expressions of 
unease 
many people are feeling rather let down delegate peter 
brown said thursday after lawson announced the continued high 
interest rates 
they are rather upset that after 10 years of conservative rule 
we should have got into these rather difficult times brown said 
at fringe meetings there also were signals the conservatives 
need to find a new agenda after dominating the decade with 
rightwing policies based on tight money curbing unions selling 
off nationalized industries and building up britains nuclear 
arsenal 
howe warned that the party needed to ensure that people 
recognize us as a listening party just as much as a crusading 
one 
the interest rates hitting homeowners and businesses have 
exacerbated the conservatives problems midway through mrs 
thatchers third term she has been in office 11 years 
polls show widespread opposition to key sections of her current 
political program a shakeup of the national health service plans 
to sell off to private enterprise the water and electric utilities 
and a new property tax 
meanwhile the socialist labor party has adopted a new more 
moderate platform and is presenting the conservatives with their 
most serious challenge since 1979 when mrs thatcher ousted prime 
minister james callaghans labor government 
labor has been in the lead in poll ratings for the past four 
months and now has an average 7point edge

thousands of radical students staged 
antius protests today burning american flags and hurling rocks 
at police after fellow students broke into the us ambassadors 
home and went on a halfhour rampage 
ambassador donald gregg and his wife escaped unhurt from the 
incident in which students hurling homemade bombs and swinging 
iron bars smashed artwork and other objects before police dragged 
them out 
later about 2000 radical students demonstrated against the 
us or south korean governments on at least 11 college campuses in 
seoul inchon and kwangju police said they said about two dozen 
students were arrested 
at konkuk sogang and kyunghee universities in seoul hundreds 
of students hurled rocks and firebombs and fought police who fired 
tear gas they burned american flags and effigies of president bush 
and south korean president roh taewoo 
the six students who occupied the greggs home gained entry by 
throwing homemade bombs to distract police guards outside the 
residence police said they then scaled the wall around the house 
throwing tear gas to keep guards away 
the greggs said they heard the intruders on the other side of 
their locked bedroom door but managed to escape via a side door 
after occupying part of the residence the students blocked the 
main door with chairs and sprayed the floor with paint thinner 
which they threatened to ignite if police attacked officials said 
unlike the us embassy the ambassadors residence is not 
guarded by us marines korean police are responsible for guarding 
the outside of the house 
embassy officials said they would review the security system 
the students who attacked the residence were from a 
selfproclaimed antius death squad they were protesting 
us pressures on south korea to open its markets and demanded that 
roh cancel his visit next week to washington for talks with 
president bush 
in washington a state department official said gregg was on his 
way to the united states to prepare for rohs visit 
the attackers smashed objects and rampaged through the house in 
central seoul for about 30 minutes before riot troopers firing tear 
gas forced their way inside and seized the students police said 
punish gregg and we oppose us trade pressure the 
students shouted one was draped in a south korean flag 
police said one student was slightly injured in the scuffle 
they said they were searching for four other students who helped 
the six attackers into the compound 
gregg and his wife meg said they were sleeping when they heard 
an explosion near dawn they did not see the students but heard 
them on the other side of their locked bedroom door 
gregg dismissed the attack as the work of six people who broke 
into our home and i dont put a larger signifiance on it than 
that 
in newark nj white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters thursday that bush just asked if they the greggs were 
safe and i assured him they were 
radical students have tried to use greggs appointment to 
galvanize antius protests contending the former seoul cia 
station chief was sent to south korea to impose military rule they 
held antigregg protests after he arrived in september burning the 
ambassador in effigy 
greggs appointment was opposed by some us senators because of 
charges he misled congress about his role in the irancontra affair 
as thenvice president bushs national security adviser some south 
korean opposition leaders questioned whether a former cia official 
was a suitable choice as ambassador but the seoul government said 
it welcomed the appointment 
south koreas governing democratic justice party condemned the 
attack as a senseless riot and the main opposition parties 
also denounced it 
south koreas radical students are a small but vocal minority on 
college campuses they have little public support because of their 
violent tactics and extremist views 
the radicals oppose seouls ties with the united states 
claiming the government is a front for american rule they have 
staged a series of attacks on us facilities to demand withdrawal 
of the 43000 american troops based in south korea 
they also want the united states to stop trying to make south 
korea drop import barriers to help reduce washingtons huge trade 
debt with seoul 
many south koreans believe the us trade pressure is unfair 
contending their markets are still vulnerable to competitive 
foreign products 
however the national assembly today adopted a resolution urging 
the government to work out a gradual timetable for opening south 
korean markets 
in a rare compromise the governing party and three opposition 
parties joined forces for the resolution which said agricultural 
markets should be opened gradually and carefully after considering 
the nations vulnerable agricultural structure

obfuscation is the name of the game in 
bureaucratic washington and larry gelbart is a master of mimicking 
the gobbledygook that passes for communication under the capitol 
dome and in the white house 
but his sense of theater is stretched mighty thin in 
mastergate a relentlessly onenote spoof of the irancontra 
hearings that opened thursday at broadways criterion center 
what did the president know and does he have any idea that he 
knew it gelbart asks its a funny line but the question is 
never really answered in this satire that would rather play with 
words than plot or character for 90 long minutes 
mastergate focuses on fictional congressional hearings held 
by something called the permanent select joint committee it 
discovers a scheme by the central intelligence agency to take over 
master pictures a big hollywood film studio through its filming 
of a vietnam war epic called tet the movie the 
governmentcontrolled studio is funneling money to los oltros 
freedomfighting guerrillas in the central american country of 
ambigua 
among the public servants called to appear before the committee 
are the vice president the secretary of state and a gungho 
mediasavvy military officer named manley battle the nations only 
fourstar major who bears more than a slight resemblance to oliver 
north 
publicity is a small price to pay for security testifies 
battle while his wife knitting an american flag sits adoringly 
beside him 
the spoofing is broad and more than a little obvious as gelbart 
attempts to dazzle with quips doubletalk bad puns and a few 
hilarious sight gags check out the look a certain grayhaired 
pearlbedecked wife of the vice president gives her husband when he 
testifies or maj battles medals so numerous his lawyer has to 
wear some of them on his lapel 
designer philipp jungs hearing room with a hokey backdrop of 
the founding fathers spreads out all over the wide stage and even 
up into the auditorium where the congressional inquisitors sit 
those who forget the past are certain to be subpoenaed 
drawls a southern senator played with the right amount of bourbon 
befuddlement by jerome kilty 
between witnesses an intense televison newswoman merry chase 
for total network news recaps events for the folks out in 
television land she has her own jargon just as difficult to 
decipher as the governmental chatter 
the debasement of language is a major theme of gelbarts play 
everyone has been coopted he seems to be saying politicians the 
public and even the press maybe thats why a few of the reporters 
are played by mannequins 
within the cartoon limits of the characters two actors stand 
out daniel von bargen as the mad major and jeff weiss a 
triplethreat man who plays a rightwing senator a liberal 
congressman and the departed cia chief 
director michael engler tries hard to keep the play from droning 
on like a real congressional committee meeting there are jarring 
lighting and music effects to keep theatergoers awake and if they 
get tired of looking at the stage the audience can watch the show 
on television monitors scattered throughout the theater 
in the end gelbarts wordplay turns preachy with the appearance 
of the dead cia director looking like dickens ghost of christmas 
past he warns of future scandals if the public isnt vigilant 
which is hardly surprising advice its a somber and uninspired 
conclusion to a play that telegraphs where its going in the first 
few minutes of the evening and then keeps recycling variations of 
the same jokes in an attempt to get laughs 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times when mastergate is funny it 
is very funny when it is not it still stands up for a patriotic 
integrity beyond the understanding of the clowns who parade across 
its national stage 
howard kissel daily news if you think the title is funny 
youll probably enjoy mastergate if you find it adolescent 
which im afraid i do stay home and read mark twain on politics 
linda winer newsday mastergate is a onejoke extended 
sketch that unfortunately never manages the leap to dramatic 
much less philosophical revelation of much we didnt already 
know nevertheless the joke is a very good one performed with 
deadpan delight by deft imitators

the surviving members of monty 
pythons flying circus sent flowers in the shape of a giant foot to 
fridays funeral for comedian graham chapman 
to graham from the other five pythons with all our love ps 
stop us if were getting too silly said a note attached to the 
flowers modeled on the foot that dropped down with a rude noise to 
end the groups television shows 
the message recalled chapmans appearances as a stiffbacked 
colonel who barged in to end sketches that had become too silly 
services for chapman who died oct 4 at age 48 were held at 
vinters park crematorium with close friends and family attending 
not many of us take the opportunity to express our convictions 
in the way that graham did and he specialized in a brand of humor 
which satirized pomposity said the rev tony porter chaplain at 
maidstone hospital where chapman died 
chapmans last words to porter were the events of this last 
year have renewed my faith in human nature 
the minister said through these words we catch a glimpse of 
graham who though vulnerable overcame many fears 
mourners at the service included chapmans companion for many 
years david sherlock and his adopted son john tomiczek 
sherlock had planned to stay away from the funeral but had a 
lastminute change of mind 
both graham and i believed in caring for the living and not 
mourning after the dead he would have understood why at first i 
wasnt going to go 
but i thought about it and felt it was only right that i 
should be there for his very last moment sherlock said 
none of the surviving pythons john cleese terry gilliam eric 
idle terry jones and michael palin attended but they are 
expected to participate at a memorial service at st pauls church

higher tides than normal caused by an unusual alignment of the 
sun moon and earth began lapping south carolinas 
hurricaneravaged beaches today but little erosion or flooding was 
expected forecasters said 
the national weather service said high tides on the atlantic and 
gulf coasts could be up to a foot higher than the highest tides of 
the past few years 
the predawn tide in south carolina today was 66 feet and tides 
were expected to rise to 73 feet by monday or slightly higher if 
accompanied by gentle winds the weather service said normally 
tides are 5 feet to 6 feet 
in folly beach sc where at least 23 beachfront structures 
were destroyed by hurricane hugo and others left teetering on 
foundations todays tides did no damage said mayor bob linville 
i went down and checked where we were expecting problems he 
said i think truthfully if the wind doesnt become a factor we 
might come out of this thing 
on the pacific coast high tide could equal the highest marks of 
recent years the service said 
the threat of coastal flooding increases if a storm surge 
should occur at the same times as the astronomical high tide the 
service said 
tide tables will show the expected heights fishermen boaters 
and residents of floodprone areas should consult the tables and be 
alert to weather forecasts the service said 
higher than normal tides also will occur nov 1213 and dec

the leader of a community college group said 
friday that state legislatures are biased against urban colleges 
and that the federal department of education takes no interest in 
their problems 
dale parnell president of the american association of community 
and junior colleges spoke at a news conference called to release a 
report on innovative programs at community colleges 
alfred a dellibovi under secretary of housing and urban 
development said at the news conference that hud officials see 
community colleges as crucial to economic growth 
we see jobs as the engine of opportunity dellibovi said 
we see jobs and payrolls as the way people are going to rebuild 
americas cities and we see community colleges as a way to get jobs 
or get better jobs 
parnell called that a great challenge for community 
colleges however he said they are not going to do it if they 
dont have the help from the decision makers 
asked why the department of education was not represented at the 
news conference parnell said they have not taken any interest 
in urban education 
hud secretary jack kemp has shown more interest in this 
subject than anyone else in this cabinet parnell said 
education department spokesman tom lyon said he had no immediate 
comment on parnells remarks but said he would look into it 
id say there is a bias in state legislatures against urban 
colleges parnell said i say that respectfully we have 
formulas that do not apply to urban colleges 
parnell also was critical of congress 
this week congress put a cap on parttime students in student 
financial aid he said urban colleges are filled with 
parttime students what kind of priority is it to say we are going 
to limit the number of parttime students i dont understand that 
kind of priority system 
ronald j temple president of wayne county community college in 
detroit and chairman of the associations commission on urban 
community colleges said such colleges need financial support 
we are not necessarily talking about substantial additional 
dollars at this point he said i think we are talking about 
conceptualizing how we as a nation are going to begin to pull 
together current resources to address urban problems 
the associations report described projects ranging from a 
senior citizens center at a former dormitory at the bronx 
community college in new york to a miami community college center 
that serves as a focus of the amnesty program for illegal aliens 
and offers almost 200 credit courses taught bilingually

retail sales rose a moderate 05 percent last 
month the government said friday in a report analysts said shows 
consumer spending is still fairly strong despite a slowing economy 
the commerce department said sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 
1452 billion last month after gaining 07 percent in both august 
and july the revised july figure was even stronger than the 05 
percent first reported 
it shows theres good solid consumer spending out there 
said economist john silvia of kemper financial services in chicago 
even excluding automobiles sales were up 04 percent 
silvia noted furniture department and drug stores they all 
were good sales numbers and i think thats what we want to see we 
dont want to see a recession 
retail sales account for about onethird of the nations 
economic activity and are one of a number of indicators watched by 
analysts to determine whether the federal reserve boards 
tightcredit policies are threatening to stall out the economy or 
just slow it enough to keep inflation in check 
retail sales have risen every month since february except for 
june when they were unchanged on the other hand the 
manufacturing sector of the economy has grown sluggish due in 
part silvia said to slowing exports 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist for the us chamber 
of commerce said the fed should not interpret the retail sales 
report as a sign of excess demand overheating the economy 
to the contrary price discounts and everyday low prices are 
fueling the rise in consumer spending hunter said 
he called on the fed instead to reduce interest rates and thus 
induce businesses to invest more to meet growing consumer demand 
durable goods sales slowed to a 06 percent gain in september 
commerce said following a strong 2 percent hike in august that was 
boosted in part by a 22 percent gain in automobile sales 
but the early summer sales were driven by endofmodelyear 
incentives that are usually offered in september and distorted the 
05 percent auto sales gain reported in september analysts said 
the 05 percent gain reflected higher prices in september 
because dealers did not discount vehicles as they usually do 
according to economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co of 
new york unit sales actually dropped by 400000 vehicles during 
the month he said 
besides automobiles sales of other durable goods categories 
split furniture and other home furnishing sales gaining 13 
percent while building materials fell 18 percent 
nondurable goods sales rose 04 percent compared with a 01 
percent drop in august all categories except apparel gained 
department stores 17 percent grocery stores 03 percent 
gasoline stations 03 percent restaurants and bars 02 percent 
and drug stores 14 percent 
apparel sales were down 05 percent after rising 08 percent the 
previous month 
for the three months from july through september overall retail 
sales were up 64 percent retail sales so far in 1989 were 61 
percent above those in the first nine months of 1988

an independent company has been formed to break 
the staid government televisions monopoly and it has gained 
rights to show outside programming including 5000 us films a 
report said friday 
there must not be a monopoly there must be freedom of choice 
for both journalists and viewers nikolai i lutsenko the 
president of the nika tv company told the weekly newspaper nedelya 
the company is working on its own programming in several 
provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a 
year the report said 
staterun tv has been one of the chief means through which the 
soviet union has tried to inculcate officially approved values into 
the population 
it has become freer under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms and some programs have sparked controversy on one program 
there was a debate on whether vladimir i lenins body should 
remain in its famous mausoleum on red square 
the majority of its programming however remains staid 
lutsenko told nedelya that he recently had been to the united 
states to pick up the rights to show us films in the soviet union 
in hollywood i concluded two contracts according to which we 
obtained the rights to 5000 of the best american films he said 
official tv occasionally shows foreign films and its coverage of 
events and the cultural life of other countries has increased 
dramtically in the past several years 
another aim of the network is to uncover local talent in the 
cities where it is operating and help them find a place on 
national soviet tv and abroad he said 
nedelyas article was accompanied by a picture of lutsenko by 
profession a scholar of asian affairs interviewing american singer 
john denver in colorado 
nika tv plans to use official televisions communications 
initially but eventually is seeking its own satellite system 
even though it will be independent of official television 
lutsenko said nika tv plans will have an oversight board that will 
includes parliamentarians members of the communist youth league 
the union of filmmakers and others 
we are all in the same boat and nika tv does not plan to rock 
it lutsenko said we will not be out of control 
however it plans to focus much of its programming on the soviet 
unions current political and economic difficulties he said 
the pain and losses of our economy culture ecology these 
are the basic themes of our programs ecology is the first 
priority he said but there also will be entertainment music 
and sports 
the company has branches in leningrad tashkent perm and alma 
ata and is organizing in vladivostok odessa and the baltic 
republics the report said

labor secretary elizabeth dole met with 
striking pittston co coal miners today and announced that the 
company chairman and the union president have agreed to meet with 
her saturday 
facetoface negotiations are the only way to settle the 
6monthold walkout she said 
i feel frustration with the impasse mrs dole said were 
talking about communities being torn apart and in some cases 
families torn apart as ive heard talking with miners this 
morning 
the two sides have held bargaining sessions since the strike 
began april 5 but in separate rooms with federal mediators 
shuttling messages back and forth mrs dole said pittston co 
chairman paul douglas and united mine workers president richard 
trumka had agreed to meet with her in a labor department office 
about 1700 miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky are 
on strike against pittston coal group inc a subsidiary of 
pittston co 
mrs dole who visited picket lines to listen to miners 
concerns about health benefits and job security was careful to 
point out that she was not taking sides in the strike and planned 
to meet with pittston officials later today in lebanon va 
im not a mediator she said im not here to say i have 
the answer to this complex problem but i do feel now it is time to 
see if we can facilitate the bargaining process 
mrs dole spoke to some of the 280 pickets at the entrance to a 
coal preparation plant that 98 striking miners invaded and occupied 
for four days in september 
umw strike captain fred wallace of lebanon said it gives us a 
shot in the arm to know that the secretary of labor is interested 
enough to come for a firsthand view 
miners told mrs dole that the contract pittston is proposing 
would reduce their health benefits threaten the stability of the 
umw pension fund and eventually break the union 
they trying to destroy our union said joel phillips a 
picket captain from castlewood 
the company repeatedly has denied it is trying to break the 
union 
heather hamilton the 3yearold daughter of a striking miner 
gave mrs dole a bouquet of flowers and told her get a contract 
for my daddy

three rare white rhinos from a zoo 
in czechoslovakia were en route friday to the san diego zoo the 
official ctk news agency reported 
we consider this a goodwill gesture a contribution to the 
general improvement in relations between our two countries said 
vaclav kubicek deputy director of the dvur kralove zoo money 
plays no role here 
in 1975 josef vagner brought the first six white rhinos to 
czechoslovakia from zaire gradually creating the largest such herd 
in captivity 
it is estimated that there are no more than 17 white rhinos 
living freely in central africa ctk reported 
keeping the only big herd in isolation is risky and so it was 
decided to share our females with san diego kubicek said 
san diego is not only the richest zoo with perfect subtropical 
climate but the scientific potential there is excellent as well 
kubicek said 
the dvur kralove zoo will receive gorillas from the san diego 
zoo in exchange for the rhinos kubicek said

that striking man who had a rendezvous with a 
beautiful woman in front of the ukraine hotel on friday looked 
familiar a lot like bond james bond 
it was in fact sean connery with actress michelle pfeiffer 
his costar in the russia house the film version of john le 
carres latest spy novel now being made in moscow 
of course the kgb has a dossier on me said the 59yearold 
scottish actor who made a career out of playing the soviet 
intelligence agencys formidable foe thats why they let me in 
my dossier in washington is even bigger than the kgb file 
connery said with a smile 
this time connery plays a book publisher recruited by british 
intelligence after he comes into contact with a soviet scientist 
smuggling defense secrets 
spying is waiting a character in le carres novel says the 
same is true of moviemaking said the films producer paul 
maslansky as the actors and dozens of extras went through two 
hours of take after take in a freezing drizzle in front of the 
hotel 
maslansky said the filming at soviet locations which began in 
leningrad oct 2 costs up to 10000 an hour excluding the 
actors salaries the total cost of five weeks of filming in the 
soviet union will be 25 million he said 
maslansky said the filming was made possible because of the 
glasnost or openness policy of president mikhail s 
gorbachev under previous leaderships there would have been a 
problem filming a le carre novel he said 
instead maslansky said there has been nothing but cooperation 
not that the story line is antisoviet if the russia house 
has villains they are the oldstyle american bureaucrats who 
refuse to shed their cold war mentality and reflexes when faced 
with new realities 
although the script was reviewed by the staterun film company 
mosfilm maslansky said there were no attempts to alter the 
chronicle of the soviet scientists attempt to smuggle military 
secrets to the west using a woman named katya pfeiffer as a 
conduit 
its really a love story set against the soviet union 
maslansky said mosfilm read the script only to make sure it 
wasnt antisoviet or pornographic 
during filming he said curious soviets come not to see the 
stars but to watch the film crew of soviets and westerners eat 
food shipped in from britain because of shortages and lack of 
variety in the soviet capital 
all the food is catered from london feeding up to 150 people 
daily the producer said people come from all over just to 
look at the food its kind of sad 
the californiaborn pfeiffer said playing a russian woman 
accent and all is the biggest challenge of her acting career she 
is being coached in dialect and spends as much time as possible 
with soviet members of the crew 
its the most difficult role i have ever done she said 
the first character of a completely different culture 
the producers expect the russia house to be released in 
1990 its release will coincide with the publication of the novel 
in russian another example of glasnost 
the book also will be serialized this year by two magazines the 
monthly foreign literature and the weekly ogonyok the producers 
said 
the british authors previous works include the spy who came 
in from the cold and tinker tailor soldier spy

nestled amid the oaks and cypresses that 
shelter deer and alligators in brazos bend state park is the 
nations newest observatory the only one of such magnitude that 
will regularly be open to the public 
contractors and volunteers working for the houston museum of 
natural science are putting finishing touches on a 13 million 
installation of the 10ton 36inch research telescope at the 
george observatory which opens saturday 
the museum using a 770000 grant from the houstonbased george 
foundation bought the 20yearold telescope described as one of 
the largest and most powerful telescopes available from louisiana 
state university two years ago 
then given a choice of about six sites by the texas parks and 
wildlife department museum officials selected an isolated spot in 
the 5000acre state park about 45 miles southwest of downtown 
houston 
although other observatories around the nation may open their 
doors to the public on occasion advance reservations and other 
restrictions are usually in effect the george observatory on the 
other hand will be available for use by anyone the only fee is 
the 2 per car admission charged to enter the park 
the current schedule will allow the public to view the stars 
every saturday night first come first served about 25 people 
will be allowed inside the observatory dome for halfhour periods 
other nights are reserved for school groups researchers and 
advanced observations 
museum officials say area schools have made plans for at least 
8000 children to visit the telescope 
part of the problem in science is that its so focused on the 
laboratory thats what kids think science is carolyn sumners 
the museums director of astronomy and physics said in an 
interview this week 
what were doing here is focusing on the observational 
sciences earth science environmental science ecology astronomy 
where you cant manipulate the environment you just observe it 
and thats the way humans are most of our lives the less we mess 
with the environment the better the more we observe it and 
understand it thats what matters 
when the public gets this theyre going to want to see the 
planets said dee graham an engineering consultant who worked 
with an identical telescope at the kitt peak observatory near 
tucson ariz saturn is just beautiful 
graham and several other workers have been tinkering this week 
with the dials and gears and bearings and mirrors that comprise the 
telescope surrendered by louisiana state because of the 30000 to 
40000 annual upkeep the device required 
houston museum officials in the market for such a telescope 
leaped at the opportunity in the spring of 1987 construction of 
the actual observatory began in march 
as part of the deal with louisiana state the baton rouge school 
will get to use the observatory for two weeks a year 
besides the public access another unusual feature of the 
observatory is its location the highest spot in the park is just 
64 feet above sea level most telescopes are perched high on 
mountaintops to escape city lights and air pollution 
scientists determined that the site had the darkest clearest 
and least polluted sky in the houston area the milky way extends 
from horizon to horizon and star patterns are clear they say 
ms sumners said she hopes to have monitors installed shortly 
that will capture the images seen through the telescope allowing 
even more people to take advantage of the observatory 
theres nothing like this in the country she said thats 
what this place is all about real science no exhibits no 
simulation here the science is real

the bar owner glanced from the door to 
his only customer thinking of bombs and his misfortune in choosing 
a location that might become a battle zone in the governments war 
with cocaine barons 
it makes me sad to think people wont come here because 
theyre afraid theyll get hurt he said i get even sadder 
when i realize that maybe theyre right that maybe a bomb could 
blow this place to pieces at any minute 
the owner who asked to be identified only as jairo opened the 
bar five months ago in a building beside a political headquarters 
it was a good spot then but has become a risky one since 
terrorists working for the drug traffickers began bombing such 
offices 
jairo acknowledged his problems paled beside the national 
turmoil that resulted when sen luis carlos galan the leading 
presidential candidate was assassinated in august and president 
virgilio barco declared war on the drug gangs in response 
a retaliatory bombing campaign by the drug traffickers has 
killed 11 people wounded 162 and shattered the nerves of thousands 
colombians are of two minds about the war 
one side says there would be no trafficking problem if north 
american noses did not require so much cocaine but that the blood 
being shed in the war is colombian 
assassins working for the drug cartels have killed 12 members of 
the supreme court a justice minister an attorney general the 
president of the countrys largest leftist party a newspaper 
publisher a governor galan and hundreds of other people 
those who favor pressing the campaign say colombia would 
surrender its sovereignty to the billionaire traffickers if it 
negotiated with them and granted amnesty 
zoraida diaz a 24yearold bogota photographer said the armed 
forces were winning because theyve raided hundreds of the drug 
traffickers properties and have sent the medellin bosses 
underground 
medellin a northwestern city is the base of the notorious 
medellin cartel colombias biggest cocaine gang 
no bosses of the medellin or cali cartels have been captured so 
far but ms diaz said she would not be surprised to see a big 
fish netted soon 
i get the impression that the medellin bosses are on the 
run she said theyve responded with a terrorist campaign that 
hasnt won them anything except the hatred of the people 
most colombians avoid reporters if they do talk most want 
their names withheld for fear the traffickers will come looking for 
them 
many apper to think the antidrug war is futile that the 
trafffickers can outlast the government with their riches bombs 
and clandestine armies 
futile or worthwhile it has sown fear and disrupted life in 
bogota and other cities 
telephoned bomb threats cause people to rush out of stores and 
offices stay home at night and avoid certain places at all times 
they duck when vehicles backfire many normally busy restaurants 
and discotheques are empty 
how long will colombians put up with such conditions the answer 
to that may determine whether the government wins since any 
significant weakening of public support could end the struggle 
president barco aware of the danger appeals frequently to the 
people he approved television advertisements offering 250000 for 
information leading to the capture of two chiefs of the medellin 
cartel pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha 
the ads urge people to denounce drug traffickers for 
yourselves for your children for colombia 
citizens whose patience has been swept away with the shattered 
glass express irritation with the united states which some 
consider the real force behind the governments antidrug campaign 
a common complaint is that the united states is not doing enough 
to fight drug use at home the us drug enforcement administration 
estimates americans consume 300 tons to 400 tons of cocaine a year 
many colombians feel the war is between societys elite and the 
government on one side and the drug cartels on the other with no 
stake for the ordinary people who are being blown up 
others prepared for an extended struggle worry about its 
longterm effects on society 
despite a violent history colombia takes pride in its 
democratic tradition it has had comparatively few military coups 
and rights are protected in a constitution dating from the 19th 
century 
gustavo gallon a human rights lawyer said barco has endangered 
civil liberties by extending his power to fight drug traffickers 
and leftist guerrillas 
he cited such decrees as one allowing the government to hold not 
just drug traffickers but any subversive incommunicado for 
seven days without formal charges 
gallon said there were three possible courses for the drug war 
a continued violent standoff a negotiated settlement or a 
government victory 
a government victory may be the worst of the three 
possibilities he said if colombia defeats traffickers it 
will be at an extreme cost to what is left of our democratic 
institutions and basic rights 
a settlement is unlikely unless a scapegoat is found for the 
terrorism committed by drug gangs he said because there are 
some crimes like the assassination of sen galan that the 
colombian people will never forgive 
prolonged violence is the most likely he said and could affect 
colombians for generations 
colombians feel anxiety about the future gallon declared 
we wonder about what effects the violence will have on our 
children and grandchildren what kind of society we will be left 
with when this violence ends if it ever ends

turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash met 
friday with deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger but 
both the state department and the greek cypriot government denied 
any shift toward recognition of the selfdeclared state 
us and greek cypriot officials stressed the informal nature of 
the meeting held over lunch in a state department dining room 
this is simply in keeping with our desire to help resolve the 
conflict said one official who asked not to be named 
the sensitivity over the meeting is a reflection of the bitter 
conflict between the mediterranean islands greek majority and 
turkish minority which has defied resolution for 26 years 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said eagleburger 
has known denktash for many years and received him as head of the 
turkish cypriot community not as leader of the breakaway state 
the us embassy in nicosia maintains continuing contact with 
denktash and we believe his meetings in washington are fully in 
keeping with our desire to be of assistance to the intercommunal 
negotiating process of cyprus through which we hope a lasting 
peaceful solution emerges she said 
it is the first time denktash has visited the state department 
since he declared a breakaway state in the northern part of cyprus 
six years ago 
only turkey which has provided 30000 troops to the turkish 
cypriots has recognized the state 
denktash and cypriot president george vassiliou began talks in 
1988 in an attempt to dissolve the partition but the talks under 
un auspices have stalled with each side blaming the other 
vassiliou was received by president bush at the white house last 
week and denktash is following in his footsteps to garner support 
for the turkish position 
we feel very strongly that weve been discriminated against 
too long and we want to be heard denktash told reporters 
the turkish cypriot community about 30 percent of the islands 
population wants a federation with the greek part of the island to 
be ruled by a central council of ministers the presidency would 
rotate between greeks and turks denktash said

the united states should follow a policy of 
hardnosed pragmatism in efforts to combat piracy of 
copyrighted publications computer software videotapes and audio 
recordings according to a report released friday 
the study was prepared by a task force of 23 industry academic 
and government representatives brought together by northwestern 
universitys annenberg washington program 
piracy of intellectual property is costing the united states 
tens of billions of dollars in lost sales and royalties said 
attorney gary m hoffman principal author of the report 
protecting intellectual property and stopping the flow of pirated 
products are critical to the future of our informationbased 
economy 
the report offered examples of technological piracy including 
pirates issued their own version of the encyclopedia britannica 
in taiwan before the legitimate edition could be published and kept 
selling it despite court rulings 
about 1000 video parlors in taiwan and many more throughout 
the third world show us and other foreign movies without paying 
publicperformance license fees and in some cases without even 
buying the videocasette from its legal distributor 
hundreds of thousands of decoders for receiving satellite 
television transmissions have been tampered with allowing people 
to view programs carried by home box office and similar networks 
the report contended that facing the challenge requires 
hardnosed pragmatism not moralizing 
our own country pirated europes intellectual property a 
century ago when the united states was a young country new 
developing countries have shortterm incentives to be free riders 
on the creativity of other nations 
permitting piracy is not however in the longterm interest 
of countries that wish to develop their own economies and 
innovative potential it said freeriding deprives them of an 
important incentive for creativity innovation and 
entrepreneurship 
policy options the panel suggested include stiffer criminal 
penalties improved enforcement of intellectual property laws 
abroad and better coordination of activities by federal agencies 
dealing with intellectual property matters 
last may seven nations identified by the washingtonbase 
intellectual property alliance as problem countries due to 
pervasive piracy were named to a priority watch list by us 
trade representative carla a hills 
the seven countries are korea taiwan china india saudi 
arabia brazil and thailand 
four other nations considered problem countries by the 
alliance were named to the trade representatives longer watch 
list these are egypt indonesia malaysia and the philippines 
according to the intellectual property alliance the 11 
countries together accounted for estimated piracy losses to the 
us companies of almost 14 billion in 1988 
the annenberg washington program was established in 1983 to 
assess how communications technologies and current public policies 
on communications affect aspects of american life including 
education medicine law politics foreign policy and financial 
markets

radical students held antiamerican 
rallies and fought police in three cities friday after compatriots 
rampaged through the us ambassadors residence at dawn 
ambassador donald gregg and his wife escaped through a side door 
minutes after six invaders with homemade bombs tear gas grenades 
and steel pipes stormed the residence and began smashing artworks 
lamps and pottery 
police used tear gas to overpower the students described by 
officials as an antius death squad they shouted drive out 
the yankees while being dragged away 
they protested us pressure on south korea to lower trade 
barriers and demanded that president roh taewoo cancel a visit to 
washington scheduled for next week 
about 2000 radical students protested or fought police later 
friday on at least 11 campuses in seoul inchon and kwangju police 
reported two dozen arrests 
hundreds of protesters at konkuk sogang and kyunghee 
universities in seoul hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police 
who responded with tear gas the students burned american flgags 
and effigies of roh and president bush 
gregg and his wife meg were sleeping when the students stormed 
the house the ambassador said he did not see the students but 
could hear them on the other side of the locked bedroom door 
i never saw any of them gregg told a news conference we 
heard shouting in korean i dont know what they were 
shouting 
he said the living room where the damage was done is 50 to 60 
feet from the bedroom 
gregg said the attack would not affect uskorean relations 
this is the act of six people who broke into our home and i dont 
put a larger signifiance on it than that he said 
south koreas governing democratic justice party called the 
rampage a senseless riot and leading opposition parties 
denounced it 
us embassy officials said there had been a security problem at 
the residence but would not elaborate they said they security 
procedures would be reviewed 
security for the residences is handled by a private firm under 
contract and us marines are not posted there the officials said 
in washington rep stephen solarz dny who heads the house 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said incidents of 
this type represent misguided actions of only a small minority 
i continue to believe that a strong ussouth korean partnership 
is in the interest of both nations 
gregg the fomer cia station chief in seoul became ambassador 
last month and radical students have been protesting since they 
claim he was sent to south korea to impose military rule 
police officials who would not let their names be used said 
the students used homemade bombs to distract police then scaled 
the wall of the residence compound and hurled tear gas grenades at 
security guards who tried to stop them 
once inside the raiders blocked the main door with chairs and 
sprayed the floor with paint thinner threatening to ignite it if 
police attacked and threw more of the homemade bombs at police 
the officials said 
us diplomats described the devices as firecrackerlike noise 
bombs used in other attacks on us diplomatic and military 
facilities which make a loud bang but cause little damage 
at least one student was draped in the south korean flag and all 
shouted punish gregg and we oppose us trade pressure 
authorities said one student was slightly injured in a scuffle 
and police were seeking four others who helped the invaders enter 
the compound 
the party for peace and democracy the main political 
opposition said it regretted the assault but said the united 
states should note that excessive trade pressure feeds 
antiamerican feeling in south korea 
radical students are a small but influential minority on college 
campuses but have little public support because of their violent 
tactics and extreme views

the woman who dresses italian style for next 
spring and summer can be anything she wants to be 
the new look offered by more than 40 top italian designers who 
presented their warm weather wears this week is both sexy and 
demure sporty and urbane tailored and languid colorful and 
muted simple and ornate 
there is less of a unified message than in past moda 
milanese seasons allowing the fashionable woman as armani put 
it to choose something which seems to be designed for her 
alone 
naturally there are trends the new style concentrates on the 
upper body with the bare midriff the newest look bra tops 
bandeaus and bustiers as well as an accent on seethrough blouses 
spell bad news for the lingerie industry the bra as an 
undergarment virtually disappears 
color is another novelty on the milan runway after many a 
season of drab shades the designers have burst out in a bright 
palette of italian fruit ice cream tones raspberry kiwi 
watermelon mango apricot peach banana blueberry and many more 
in some of the collections these shades are in muted pastels black 
also plays a big role by night 
short skirts no longer make news in italy with the young and 
old stout and slim alike showing off their legs it is no 
surprise that short skirts continue to dominate the runway next 
seasons miniskirt is not as hiphugging as the winter version with 
a preference for draping and tie skirts like the ones worn by 
south sea island natives 
there is little for city dwellers and working women in the new 
collections with the emphasis on holiday attire shorts jumpsuits 
gaily printed sun dresses pajama pants and loose shirt jackets

president bush issued a new call friday for 
the overthrow of panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega saying 
i wouldnt mind using force if it could be done in a prudent 
manner but he emphasized he was not offering a blanket 
commitment of american troops 
ten days after an uprising against the panamanian general was 
crushed bush vigorously defended his handling of the situation 
rejecting criticism from democrats and republicans alike over his 
refusal to provide us military assistance 
he seemed particularly disturbed by charges that he abandoned 
the rebels leaving them on their own after publicly exhorting the 
panamanian military to oust noriega bush said that was a stupid 
argument that some very erudite people make 
at a hurriedly called news conference bush also addressed 
politically charged issues in congress he said 
he opposes federal funding of abortions for poor women who are 
victims of rape and incest but holds out hopes for a congressional 
compromise that would avoid a veto on my part he said he would 
see if there is room for flexibility when senate and house 
negotiators work out a compromise version of a bill that now would 
allow such federal payments 
he will permit a bill outlawing flag burning to become law 
without his signature i dont think its enough bush said 
renewing his call for a constitutional amendment along the same 
lines but adding that he would not veto the legislation in the 
meantime 
he still wants congress to approve his plan for a cut in the 
capital gains tax and he did not rule out the possibility of 
signing legislation that combined his proposal with a democratic 
version liberalizing individual retirement accounts a few hours 
later senate leaders agreed on a plan to strip hundreds of 
specialinterest provisions from a 141 billion deficitreduction 
bill leaving the capital gains fight for the future 
asked about attempts in congress to repeal catastrophic health 
care legislation for the elderly bush made clear he was staying 
away from that controversial topic preferring instead to let the 
congressional process hash this out 
as for a possible future coup against noriega bush said i 
hope i would never be reckless enough as a commanderinchief to 
make a blanket commitment to use of force without knowing the facts 
regarding some coup attempt 
on the other hand the president said i wouldnt mind using 
force if it could be done in a prudent manner so in other words 
im not ruling out the use of force for all time 
bush said i am not going to give carte blanche support to an 
operation particularly when they dont ask for this support and i 
have to reserve that right i have at stake the lives of american 
kids and i am not going to easily thrust them into a battle unless 
i feel comfortable with it and unless those general officers in 
whom i have total confidence feel comfortable 
he rejected the idea of noriega giving up power in return for 
dismissal of drugtrafficking charges in the united states a 
possibility that a reporter suggested had been raised with the 
president it would send an impossible signal in this fight 
against drugs bush said 
while defending his handling of the coup attempt bush said the 
administration was reviewing procedures to see if we cant do it 
better 
in miami adela bonilla de giroldi widow of the coup leader 
said the us militarys cautious attitude toward coup leaders had 
stalled vital aid at a key moment in particular she said us 
officials were slow to react when one of the plotters tried to use 
a telephone number that us authorities had provided for use in an 
emergency 
bush promised to look into her complaint to the degree we can 
improve our communications fine he said 
as a result of an internal review the administration has 
decided that a crisismanagement team will be automatically 
convened in the white house situation room in future emergencies a 
senior official said 
representatives of such agencies as the pentagon cia and state 
department will be summoned to coordinate the flow of information 
the official said insisting on anonymity 
hinting that he may seek congressional approval for greater 
authority in dealing with situations like the coup in panama bush 
said i want as broad a power as possible and i think under the 
constitution the president has it 
although some members of his administration have faulted the way 
the coup was handled bush insisted there was no secondguessing 
and all of them are singing from the same sheet of music 
he said of his staff they all did a good job

nineteen greyhounds were released by an 
army hospital ordered to halt research that would have involved 
breaking the dogs hind legs 
letterman general hospital agreed to release the dogs thursday 
after an animal rights group won the court order 
the order also forces the army to confirm whether the former 
owners of the dogs had knowingly given them up for research the 
dogs were released to the marin humane society and will be reunited 
with former owners or offered for adoption 
the hospital acquired the dogs for 300 each from a middleman 
and had intended to use them in research on healing broken bones 
because greyhounds are a docile stoic breed that can endure pain 
without turning mean 
a hospital worker upset by the experiment alerted the marin 
humane society which notified the in defense of animals group and 
other animalrights organizations 
the experiment called for removing three inches of bone from a 
hind leg of each dog and replacing the missing section with a new 
synthetic material designed for bone replacement 
the dogs were to be killed and the broken legs saved for testing 
of the new material

buddhist monks chanted and prayed friday to 
welcome the completion of a smiling bronze buddha half the height 
of the statue of liberty that sits crosslegged on a hill outside 
hong kong facing china 
publicity material claims the 134foottall 77 million statue 
is the worlds tallest bronze buddha in the open air it was made 
from bronze crafted in communist china 
the 250ton statue sits next to the po lin monastery on the 
outlying lantao island a onehour ferry ride from downtown hong 
kong 
you can definitely see it from a plane said architect peter 
ng of the buddha which is about half the height of the 305foot 
statue of liberty in new york harbor 
in a rainsoaked ceremony a crane placed part of the buddhas 
head on top the statue while chanting monks circled it blessing 
the guests 
the statue is the brainchild of sik chi wan 56 the monasterys 
director who has lived there since he was 3 
i ate the monks meals and have to do something for the 
monastery said chi wan he said that after viewing buddha 
statues in china japan and taiwan he asked himself if they can 
do it why cant we 
hong kong is such a prosperous place we also need some kind 
of religious symbol he said lantao is a buddhist holy land 
and i think we can build it here 
the buddha sits on a base that resembles a circular altar of the 
temple of heavenly peace in beijing 
he faces northeast overlooking the monastery and further out 
china but chi wai said there is no political relevance to the 
buddhas facing china which takes over this british colony in 
eight years 
we consulted a fung shui expert who said the direction would 
give the greatest blessing to those who donated and supported the 
construction of the buddha he explained 
the project was funded by donors in hong kong and china many of 
whom will have their names and pictures placed on the walls of a 
memorial hall at the statues base about 71 million was raised 
in hong kong through the sale of commemorative cards bronze coins 
and bronze buddha figurines the rest was raised by buddhists in 
china 
sitting atop the 1591foot muk yu wooden fish hill the 
statue consists of 222 bronze pieces made by the nanjing chengguang 
machinery factory in china they have been assembled on the island 
over the past three years 
the buddha includes many symbols said chi wai his halfopen 
eyes signals he is looking after the ordinary people his right 
hand half raised symbolizes the easing of pain on earth his left 
hand rests on his lap with his palm facing out a sign of giving 
away happiness 
chi wai believes his buddha has no rival 
ours is better because it is taller looks kinder and more 
peaceful he said 
chi wai denied the project was an attempt to attract more 
tourists to the island already filled on weekends with vacationers 
a buddhist saying goes when you are confused go into a 
temple or tower once you say a prayer you will feel the truth of 
buddhism he said 
it means a religious person can feel the tranquility once they 
see the statue a nonreligious person can also observe this work 
of art he said

new arguments over christianmoslem 
power sharing and a timetable for syrian troop withdrawal dimmed 
hopes friday that lebanese legislators had found a formula for 
ending their countrys 14year civil war 
a meeting to put the finishing touches on a tentative agreement 
was postponed repeatedly prince saud alfaisal the saudi foreign 
minister met with george saddeh a christian member of the 
parliamentary committee who stormed out of a meeting thursday night 
edmond rizk a lebanese deputy said the two agreed on a 
unified formula on the issues that caused the postponement he 
would not give details but said the syrian role in lebanon was not 
discussed 
conference sources said they expected a full meeting saturday of 
the 63 legislators who must approve any agreement reached by the 
17member negotiating committee 
saddeh who leads the rightwing phalange party accused moslems 
on thursday of making crippling demands he did not specify the 
demands but sent a note to the press center saying they affect 
intrinsic issues and cannot be accepted under any 
circumstances 
according to the sources syrianbacked moslem legislators 
insisted on greater political concessions by the christians who 
made their own demands about syrian withdrawal 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 one year after the outbreak of 
a sectarian civil war that has cost more than 150000 lives 
gen michel aoun the christian army commander has declared a 
war of liberation to drive the syrians out 
artillery battles between aouns forces and a moslem alliance 
led by the syrians which began march 8 killed more than 900 
people and wounded nearly 3000 before an arab league ceasefire 
took effect sept 22 and the legislators met in taif to seek a 
solution 
lebanese sources said saadeh walked out thursday night as sunni 
and shiite moslem lawmakers argued over the powers of the 
parliament speaker traditionally a shiite they said deputies held 
side consultations friday in an effort to head off further 
disagreement 
on thursday conference sources said the committee had reached 
preliminary agreement on a national reconciliation charter and 
would meet friday to complete the document 
aoun declared in beirut a few hours later that the deliberations 
were irrelevant and he would continue his war on the syrians 
we cannot rebuild our country under the shadow of an occupying 
force he declared 
assafir a leftist beirut newspaper said aouns remarks 
amounted to a public and direct threat to christian legislators 
in taif against making major political concessions without 
guarantees of a swift syrian withdrawal 
sources gave no details of the tentative accord which must be 
approved by all 63 legislators attending the taif meeting beirut 
radio stations close to the factions said it included a limited 
and phased syrian withdrawal and political reforms that reduce 
the presidents power 
under an unwritten covenant observed since independence from 
france in 1943 the president is christian the prime minister a 
sunni moslem and the parliament speaker a shiite 
the arab league peace plan on which the ceasefire is based 
envisages gradual abolition of sectarianism and syrian withdrawal 
to eastern lebanon within two years while law and order is restored 
and militias disbanded 
christians demand complete syrian withdrawal within two months 
and moslems want an equal share of political power which the 
christians say they wont allow without guarantees about the 
pullout 
lebanons christians were the majority in 1943 and have 
dominated the government parliament judiciary and army moslems 
make up 55 percent of the 4 million people and demand more power

economic growth in 1990 will slump to 
its slowest pace in eight years with an outright recession a 
distinct threat unless the federal reserve lowers interest rates 
the nations top business executives forecast friday 
the business council composed of the chief executives of 100 of 
the countrys largest corporations said that the economy began to 
lose steam this summer they predicted that the sluggish period 
will last through much of next year 
the forecast said however that a timely assist from the fed 
could make the slowdown the pause that refreshes and lead to a 
rebound in growth in 1991 that would give the country an 
unprecedented nine consecutive years without a recession 
the study prepared by a panel of top corporate economists 
predicted that the overall economy as measured by the gross 
national product will expand at a 29 percent rate this year 
identical to the bush administrations forecast 
for 1990 however the business council said growth will slump 
to an anemic 18 percent annual rate the slowest pace since the 
recession year of 1982 
this prediction is significantly below the administrations 
outlook for growth of 23 percent next year and would represent a 
blow to republican hopes for reasonably robust growth to boost 
their chances in the 1990 congressional races 
there are a variety of potential weaknesses in the economy 
that carry the risk of a recession said lewis t preston 
chairman of jp morgan inc the large new york bank f i were 
the fed i would be inclined to lean in the direction of an easier 
policy my sense is that we will need a fair amount of insurance 
against trouble 
the administration has also been pushing the central bank to 
lower interest rates as a way of making american exports more 
competitive overseas lower interest rates in this country make 
dollardenominated investments less attractive to foreigners and 
thus lower the value of the dollar 
however federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given no 
indication that the fed is going to loosen credit anytime soon and 
in fact the fed is still sending signals that it is worried about 
inflationary pressures 
the government reported friday that inflation at the wholesale 
level shot up 09 percent in september 
many of the business executives however dismissed the 
inflation report as a temporary blip that did nothing to change 
their view that recession and not inflation was the bigger threat 
facing the economy at the present time 
james d robinson iii the chairman of american express co 
said that the fed has done a good job in holding inflation in check 
following a spurt in prices earlier this year but now is the time 
to bring interest rates down 
the business executives forecast that inflation will show 
further moderation with the consumer price index rising at annual 
rates of 45 percent or less over the next two yearsthe business 
chiefs were also optimistic that us exports will remain strong 
over the next two years helping to drive the merchandise trade 
deficit down to 100 billion next year the growth in exports was 
based on a belief that strong growth in europe and japan will spur 
continued demand for us goods even with the rise in the value of 
the dollar this year 
the forecast was released on the opening day of the business 
councils fall meeting at a mountain resort in virginia 
despite the outlook for a significant slowdown in growth and the 
fact that corporate profits have already begun to sag the business 
executives were generally optimistic about their prospects in the 
coming year 
roger smith the chairman of general motors and the head of the 
business council said that us auto sales should be above 15 
million units for the sixth consecutive year despite the 
projections of doomsayers to the contrary 
treasury undersecretary david mulford who spoke to the 
executives during a closeddoor session told reporters afterward 
that reports of a dispute between the administration and the fed 
had been blown out of proportion 
he said that only very minor differences existed between the 
two over such issues as interest rate policy

president bush said friday he will not veto a 
law to outlaw flagburning even though he will continue trying to 
amend the constitution as a stronger way to accomplish the same end 
i dont think its enough bush said of the flag legislation 
he said he will allow the newly passed bill to become law 
automatically without his signature but added he does not think 
the law will withstand legal challenges 
im withholding that signature to signal our belief that a 
constitutional amendment is the best way to provide lasting 
protection for the flag bush told reporters at a brief white 
house news conference 
a firestorm of controversy regarding the us flag arose after 
the supreme court overturned a texas conviction last june ruling 
that protesters could legally burn the flag under constitutional 
freespeech guarantees 
bush proposed a new constitutional amendment against flag 
desecration but congress chose to deal with the matter through 
legislation rather than changing the constitution 
the legislation approved by the house and senate put the 
president in a politically prickly position in vetoing it he 
might have risked being seen as throwing out a proflag bird in the 
hand just for the chance to push congress on a constitutional 
amendment that would be harder to get approved 
he also found himself in a situation similar to his democratic 
presidential opponent from last year michael dukakis who vetoed 
flag legislation on grounds it was unconstitutional the 
massachusetts governor was scathingly criticized by bush for 
rejecting the legislation which would have required public schools 
teachers in the state to lead pupils in daily recitations of the 
pledge of allegiance 
legislation becomes law automatically if the president does not 
act on it within 10 working days of when congress sends it to the 
white house unless congress is in recess then a president can 
pocketveto bills by refusing to sign them 
bush said his decision to let it become law was not politically 
motivated 
i dont want to set the clock way back and rule out the 
legislation even though i dont think its enough he said 
bush repeated his contention that the new federal legislation 
will not survive court challenges i can understand the rationale 
of those who voted for this legislation but in my view it is not 
the ultimate answer he said 
he called the flag a unique and special symbol of our nation 
and it should be protected from desecration 
bush said the congressional vote was an overwhelming 
expression on the part of the congress to do something about the 
protection of the flag 
the house voted 31743 thursday to complete congressional action 
on the bill 
the measure requires up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine for 
anyone who knowingly mutilates defaces physically defiles 
burns maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any flag 
of the united states 
the senate is set next week to take up a constitutional 
amendment measure geared toward protecting the flag

the government friday issued rules states must 
follow in setting up required education job training and work 
programs to help welfare recipients become selfsufficient 
the rules implement the job opportunities and basic skills 
training program a 37 billion fiveyear initiative passed by 
congress last year it was the first major welfare overhaul in more 
than half a century 
this final rule recognizes that parents must work toward 
selfsufficiency and government must support their efforts said 
eunice thomas acting assistant secretary of the family support 
administration at the department of health and human services 
all states must have a jobs program approved by the federal 
government no later than oct 1 1990 
twentyfive states that have begun their programs must have them 
reapproved to assure they comply said david siegel a family 
support administration spokesman 
states whose progam funding will be matched by the federal 
government initially will have to bring 7 percent of their 
caseload in aid to families with dependent children programs under 
the new plan and by 1994 will be required to have 20 percent in 
the program 
about 37 million families receive afdc the nations largest 
cash assistance program costing about 85 billion a year hhs 
estimates that up to 138000 families will be able to leave the 
welfare rolls over the first five years of the jobs program 
the plan requires that one parent in twoparent welfare families 
to work at least 16 hours a week as a condition for receiving 
benefits 
single welfare parents with children 3 years or older must 
participate in employment and training programs and teenage 
parents who have not finished high school will be required to 
return to school or work toward an equivalent degree 
states must guarantee child care for parents who participate in 
the education and training programs 
kathy patterson of the american public welfare association 
which represents the state human services agencies that will 
implement the programs said the rules give states more flexibility 
than did the governments initial proposal 
were pleased they listened to some of the comments the states 
made she said 
however she said the associations evaluation was based only on 
a briefing by officials at the departments family support 
administration and that some of the regulations present concerns 
one such concern is that the rules may impose an overly stringent 
cap on funds for child care

woody allen who supports mayoral candidate 
david dinkins says recent remarks by fellow comic jackie mason 
who supports dinkins republican opponent were distorted by a 
foolish and pious media 
at a dinkins fundraiser thursday night allen said he found 
no malice or racism in comments made by mason that were printed 
in the village voice and elsewhere two weeks ago mason was forced 
to resign as rudolph giulianis honorary campaign chairman over the 
incident 
the village voice quoted mason as saying dinkins looked like a 
model without a job and that there was a sick jewish problem of 
voting for a black man dinkins is black 
mason also reportedly referred to dinkins as a fancy shvartze 
with a mustache shvartze is a yiddish term for blacks that is 
generally derogatory 
i think that hes in no way racially prejudiced and that he 
was just joking and these are the same jokes that hes always 
made and that the press was pious and foolish and you know that 
he got a raw deal allen said of mason star of abcs chicken 
soup 
he was just joking in the same style that he always jokes 
allen said shvartze could be pejorative he said but i 
dont think its pejorative in this case 
he also defended masons suggestion that jews would vote for 
dinkins out of guilt i dont know whether its jews or blacks 
but i think that people make decisions out of guilt as a 
motivation 
dinkins stood by as allen spoke to reporters at the 
1000ahead fundraiser at the home of arthur krim chairman of 
orion pictures the smile left his face and he replied curtly 
ive made all the comments i intend to make on that subject 
frankly i would prefer to talk about crime and drugs and 
housing and homelessness and i would hope that i could somehow or 
other interest the media in these issues as well he said 
allen said he had met mason once for only 30 seconds a former 
standup comic himself the director featured a gaggle of borsht 
belt gagmen similar to mason in his film broadway danny rose 
another comedian billy crystal made a face when asked about 
masons comments in a usa today interview i think jackies 
remarks are jackies remarks he said 
he did say he thought mason should have known better and he 
adapted a basic rule of standup comedy to apply to politics if 
youre going to be a spokesperson know the room

prime minister margaret thatcher 
defended her economic strategy friday but a jump in inflation to 
76 percent took some of the gloss off a rousing speech winding up 
the conservative partys annual conference 
when the choice is between high interest rates now or 
persistent higher inflation later with all the damage that would 
do the choice is clear mrs thatcher said britains economy 
is strong when inflation is beaten britain will be stronger 
still 
mrs thatcher who turned 64 on friday received a rapturous 
ovation from the 9000 party activists packed into conference hall 
in this north england resort 
she hailed 1989 as the year when the people of half our 
continent began to throw off their chains adding we didnt 
know it at the time but the torch we lit in britain which 
transformed our country the torch of freedom that is now the 
symbol of our party became a beacon that has shed its light 
across the iron curtain into the east 
delegates tapped their feet to the strains of the beatles 
classic when im 64 and after the keynote speech sang happy 
birthday and burst into the favorite tory anthem land of hope 
and glory 
they waved huge blue tory banners and chanted 10 more years 
as mrs thatcher made her way out of the ballroom 
despite the razzmatazz mrs thatcher who came to power in 1979 
and won a third fiveyear term in 1987 ended the convention with 
her party in trouble 
fears of an economic recession have combined with unpopular 
plans for a new property tax and privatization of the water and 
electricity industries to depress tory fortunes 
after 10 years in government margaret thatcher is facing her 
toughest test commented the respected weekly the economist 
which usually supports the thatcher government 
mrs thatcher made no direct reference to the conservatives 
slumping popularity now an average 7 points behind the socialist 
labor party 
but she said inflation was too high and acknowledged that 
soaring interest rates doubled to 15 percent in the past 16 
months were hitting businesses and millions of homebuyers 
in london the government announced that the annual inflation 
rate has risen to 76 percent from 73 percent which was already 
among the highest in industrialized countries 
mrs thatcher said the labor party surging ahead on a new more 
moderate platform was seeking power at any price and theyll say 
anything to get it 
labors real prescription for britain is the disease half the 
world is struggling to cure she added referring to reforms in 
poland and hungary and protests against east germanys hardline 
communist rulers 
labor last month ditched its policy of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament and mrs thatcher dismissed the action as no more 
than a confidence trick 
its still unilateral disarmament unilateral disarmament by 
agreement with the soviet union she said that isnt a defense 
policy to see britain through the 1990s its a form of words to see 
labor through the next election 
she took a few cracks at critics of her rigorous tightmoney 
brand of conservatism including academics and some church leaders 
i went to oxford university but ive never let it hold me 
back she said of the ancient university which in 1985 voted 
against giving her an honorary doctorate in protest at cuts state 
grants 
the fourday convention was overshadowed by economic problems 
inflation fuelled by a booming credit began to take off again 
last year 
the government is using high interest rates as the sole means of 
trying both to curb inflation and defend the value of the pound 
pressure is mounting from right and left big business trade 
unions and the labor party for mrs thatcher to speed up british 
entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary 
system it is links the currencies of most of the 12member nations 
of the european economic community 
the issue has divided mrs thatcher who has set stringent 
conditions for entry and chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
critics charge that the differences mean the government lacks a 
coherent economic strategy 
during the conference there were also signs of unease that mrs 
thatchers combative style is not working any more some top tories 
say privately they also fear that she will not be able to pull the 
economy around before the next election which must be held by 
mid1992

mental retardation is rising among soviet children 
because of worsening alcoholism among parents a newspaper said 
friday in the latest media revelation on how children suffer for 
soviet societys ills 
one special education school in the southern russian city of 
oryol has seen the number of retarded children it serves more than 
quintuple during a period when the citys population only doubled 
the daily sovietskaya rossia reported 
the newspaper attributed the rising retardation rate to the 
intractable alcoholism that drives soviets to make bootleg liquor 
and drink everything from aftershave lotion to insect repellent 
other recent soviet media reports have focused on baldness 
deformities and diseases in children living in polluted areas and 
on the terrible toll radiation has taken on babies on the chukotka 
peninsula in the soviet northeast 
infant mortality remains high in the entire soviet union 
pravda reported friday and allergies cancer and heart disease are 
increasing because of pollution 
more than 90 children were reported to have lost their hair this 
year in towns near the shaleoil fields in the baltic coast of 
estonia due to an ailment apparently caused by the dirty 
environment other outbreaks of child baldness were reported in the 
ukraine 
in chukotka which lies across the bering strait from alaska 
nuclear tests carried out decades ago have left such a high level 
of radiation that the cancer rate there is 23 times higher than 
the national average and infant mortality can reach up to 100 
deaths per 1000 infants the moscow news reported this summer 
the people of northern russia are considered to be living in 
some of the countrys worst conditions with pollution widespread 
and shortages especially extreme

attackers hurled firebombs into the home 
of an opposition figure from neighboring malawi on friday and 
killed seven people police said but the apparent target of the 
attack was not in the house 
four of the victims were children ranging in age from two months 
to eight years police said five people were injured including 
the owner of the house mkwapatira mhango 
mhango is secretary of publicity and information of the malawi 
freedom movement or mafremo which opposes the government of 
malawis president kamuzu banda 
he said the apparent target of the firebombing was edward 
chirwa mafremos chairman who had been visiting zambia and 
staying with mhango 
this must have been politically motivated from malawi said 
mhango who was hospitalized with severe burns 
dr chirwa was here on a private visit and not to hatch a plot 
against the malawian government mhango said he said chirwa 
returned to malawi a few days ago 
an official at the malawi high commission or embassy said the 
malawi government would never countenance state terrorism the 
official refused to be identified 
mhangos two wives three of their children and a visiting 
malawian woman and her baby were killed in the attack in the 
workingclass suburb of kamwala police said 
mhangos four other children were hospitalized with severe 
burns nurses said they said mhangos condition was satisfactory 
police said the gang first hurled rocks through the windows of 
the house and then flaming firebombs 
the victims suffocated or died in the blaze that destroyed most 
of the bungalow 
police spokesman max nkole said a motive had not been 
established and no one was under arrest 
mhango has been living in exile in lusaka for many years he 
distributes propaganda against bandas government 
banda led the british colony of nyasaland to independence as 
malawi in 1964 all opposition parties in his tiny southern african 
nation are outlawed an undisclosed number of opponents are in 
detention and thousands more have fled the country 
banda declared himself president for life in 1971 and he has 
survived several assassination attempts 
mafremo the socialist league of malawi and the congress for 
the second republic are opposition movements that have sprung up 
over the years and pledged to topple banda and restore democracy 
the last leader of mafremo attati mpakati was assassinated by 
unknown gunmen in the zimbabwe capital of harare in march 1983

computer experts received scattered reports today of computer 
viruses that had struck unsuspecting users on friday the 13th even 
as they cautioned that fears of widespread damage were overblown 
an institute for the blind in london was among the victims 
although it apparently was infected with a previously known virus 
not the socalled columbus day virus that was seen for the first 
time when it was activated by computers internal clocks at 1201 
today 
ross m greenberg a security specialist in new york and creator 
of the flushot plus and virexpc antiviral software said at 
midmorning that he had received seven reports of virus strikes 
since midnight but only one was the columbus day virus 
he said 12 personal computers at columbia university in new york 
city were affected but that the university had made backup files 
and was merely inconvenienced 
several officials at columbia today said they were unable to 
confirm the report and greenberg acknowledged the information was 
not firsthand 
the other six virus reports greenberg received were of the 
socalled plo virus an older virus designed to erase programs 
every friday the 13th greenberg had said earlier that the plo 
virus was far more widespread and likely to cause more trouble 
today than the new columbus day virus 
in britain the royal national institution for the blind 
reported that it was struck by a virus 
we found that most of our program files are gone every time 
we try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of our 
eyes said corri barrett of the institute in london its 
horrendous months and months of work has been wiped out here 
barrett said in a bbctv interview that the virus might have 
contaminated disks distributed to blind clients and that their 
systems had been infected 
greenberg said the virus was almost certainly the plo virus 
the columbus day virus also called the datacrime virus does 
not erase files but is programmed to scramble indexing information 
in ibm or ibmcompatible personal computers it would be the 
equivalent of removing a librarys card catalog 
computer viruses created by anonymous programmers are pieces 
of software that make copies of themselves and spread from one 
machine to another through infected floppy disks office networks 
or phone links such as computer bulletin boards 
once activated the rogue program copies itself like a breeding 
germ eating away processing power and storage space or destroying 
information about 30 viruses are known to exist not counting 
strains and mutations 
fears of a virus could be beneficial if they get people to 
think of making backup files as readily as they think of wearing 
seat belts said martha brothers of atampt bell laboratories 
alex williams receptionist at ibm corps regional marketing 
and service center in baltimore said he had received no reports of 
a virus infection with the companys equipment or from area 
customers this morning 
usually if anything like that happens we get a message and i 
havent seen a thing williams said 
in switzerland bernhard schmid head of the federal personal 
computer team said several dozen of the governments 3500 
personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus but 
that experts managed to cancel and reprogram all infected programs 
he said infected programs had been found in a wide range of 
administrative branches 
the portuguese news agency lusa said the portuguese computing 
association was informed of two viral outbreaks today but they 
were both strains that appeared previously a leading bank and a 
mediumsize industrial concern were affected lusa said it did not 
identify the companies 
last november a virus spread through a computer network shared 
by colleges research centers and the military it took several 
days to cleanse the 60000 computers in the network affected by the 
virus which had multiplied out of control overloading the 
memories of the computer systems it invaded 
since march a dozen cases of the columbus day virus have been 
found dormant in computers when people noticed that some of their 
files had swollen inexplicably infected programs were turned over 
to experts who dismantled the virus and found out when it would be 
triggered 
we want to send a calming message to people that if they take 
reasonable precautions this virus poses no more danger than any 
other said thomas p malarkey deputy chief of the national 
computer security center 
said greenberg all the people i consider to be respectable in 
the antivirus community have a similar opinion to mine that the 
datacrime virus has been blown way out of proportion by an 
unknowledgeable media

despite a sharp increase in the number of 
arrests and plants destroyed the size of the marijuana crop 
growing illegally in national forests will probably remain the same 
for the next several years the us forest service said friday 
the report also said that organized networks of growers and 
distributors now control more than half of the marijuana crop in 
the national forests and the number of clandestine drug labs most 
producing methamphetamines remains a serious problem 
the report was released by rep ron wyden dore and the 
successful sponsor of legislation last year giving the forest 
service increased powers to deal with drug problems in the federal 
forests 
wyden said he would ask william bennett the presidential drug 
policy coordinator next week to form a strike force to 
spearhead the war on the drug networks operating in the national 
forests 
in the 1988 drug act we told the forest service go 
getem wyden said this report shows how well theyve done 
but theyre catching the equivalent of serfs and peasants they 
must now catch the lords who direct forest crime 
the forest service said in the report that it expected to be 
faced with a continuing drug production challenge in the national 
forest system for the foreseeable future 
the report recounting figures that had largely been released 
previously said 
almost 415000 marijuana plants were eradicated in the national 
forests in 1988 an 84 percent increase over the 254950 plants 
destroyed in 1987 
law enforcement personel made 543 arrests in 1988 up roughly 
300 percent over the 135 arrests in 1987 
areas in the national forests considered unsafe because of 
marijuana crops that could be boobytrapped or armed growers 
defending their plants fell about 50 percent from 772600 acres in 
1987 to 388800 acres in 1988 
some 116 boobytraps were found in 1988 compared with 83 in 
1987 the number of weapons seized grew from 101 to 271 and the 
number of drugrelated assaults dropped from 19 to 11 
preliminary estimates for the first nine months of 1989 suggest 
that the number of arrests and plants destroyed this year will 
exceed last years totals the forest service said 
our analysis of these trends suggest that despite increased 
eradication and apprehension effectiveness the total volume of 
cannabis produced in the national forest system may remain about 
the same for the next several years the forest service said 
roughly twothirds of the cannabis sites found and half the 
plants eradicated in 1988 were in the national forests of the 
south the report said 
the daniel boone national forest in kentucky because of its 
nearness to urban markets in the east and the depressed local 
economy accounted for almost 25 percent of the cannabis eradicated 
throughout the national forest system in 1988 the report said

president bushs handling of flag legislation 
he didnt want but didnt dare veto demonstrates anew his 
understanding of the red white and blue politics he used so 
effectively against michael dukakis in the 1988 presidential 
campaign 
veto a bill that makes it a crime to desecrate the flag bush 
was not about to fall into the legalistic trap that ensnared 
dukakis when he vetoed legislation to require recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance to the flag 
then was bush ready to sign the flag bill into law not exactly 
this president who is raising the art of compromise to new 
levels took a different tack he suggested he didnt dislike the 
legislation enough to veto it he didnt like it enough to sign it 
i will allow the bill to become law without my signature 
said bush who vowed to continue pressing for a constitutional 
amendment 
it was a graphic reminder of bushs 1988 campaign stand that he 
would have found a way to require teachers to lead pupils in the 
pledge of allegiance 
for dukakis there was no compromise when confronted with 
legislation he believed violated the constitution he saw his 
choice as sign or veto his duty as veto 
bush rarely sees things in such stark terms even an issue that 
he pursues with as much fervor as protecting the flag 
the bill sent to bush would mandate up to a year in jail and a 
1000 fine for anyone who knowingly mutilates defaces 
physically defiles burns maintains on the floor or ground or 
tramples upon any flag of the united states 
many critics believe the bill will not pass review by the 
supreme court bush never has publicly addressed the issue of its 
constitutionality 
it moved through congress swiftly completing its legislative 
journey with a 317to34 vote thursday in the house 
after the supreme court ruled last june that flagburning was a 
constitutionally protected form of free speech bush was among the 
first to call for amending the constitution to permit congress and 
the states to make such behavior illegal 
he stood before the iwo jima memorial a statue depicting 
marines raising the flag on that bloody world war ii battleground 
to declare his support for an amendment and his belief it was an 
issue that transcends politics and patriotism 
but the politics of the moment were unmistakable 
while congressional democrats balked at amending the 
constitution they had learned the lessons of the 1988 presidential 
campaign 
before we amend the constitution we should approach the 
question with a statutory change said house speaker thomas 
foley dwash the democrats rushed to draft legislation to protect 
the flag without changing the constitution 
bush termed their efforts inadequate but he steered clear of 
making the debate a partisan fight 
i dont have disrespect for those who want to find a different 
answer was his response when asked to comment on the legislative 
effort 
while foley echoed the presidents statements about keeping the 
debate above politics the democrats had to get some satisfaction 
out of putting bush in the position of opposing their flag 
protection bill 
but they had little hope bush would react the way dukakis did to 
the pledge of allegiance bill passed by the massachusetts 
legislature during his first term as governor 
dukakis vetoed that bill because he believed it was 
unconstitutional to require public school teachers to lead pupils 
in daily recitation of the pledge and he never seemed to comprehend 
why people didnt agree with his view of his clear duty in that 
case 
in his speech accepting the republican presidential nomination 
bush put the issue this way 
should public school teachers be required to lead our children 
in the pledge of allegiance my opponent says no but i say yes 
he closed that speech by asking everyone in this great hall to 
stand and join me as he recited the pledge of allegiance

blacks planned 17 rallies 
across the country saturday to celebrate the imminent release of 
eight major antiapartheid leaders including seven jailed for a 
quartercentury 
walter sisulu a leader of the african national congress and at 
least four of his jailed colleagues were flown friday from their 
cape town prison to their hometown of johannesburg according to 
airline personnel 
the men were immediately taken to diepkloof prison outside the 
city and near the huge soweto township according to various 
reports 
another prisoner raymond mhlaba was flown from cape town to 
his hometown the southern city of port elizabeth 
the whiterun government announced tuesday that the eight 
ranging in age from 60 to 80 would be freed unconditionally 
officials have refused to say when or where the men will be 
released some if not all were expected to be freed over the 
weekend 
seven of the men are ranking african national congress members 
and sisulu 77 is the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawed 
guerrilla movement after nelson mandela 
mandelas release has not yet been approved but is widely 
expected in the next few months 
the eighth jafta masemola belongs to a smaller black 
nationalist guerrilla movement the pan africanist congress 
the decision by president fw de klerk to release the activists 
has generally won high praise both in south africa and abroad de 
klerk who became president in august says he wants to end racial 
discrimination and negotiate a new constitution that will bring the 
black majority into the national government 
however almost all black political leaders have said they will 
not negotiate with de klerk until the government makes several 
concessions including the release of political prisoners 
antiapartheid leaders applied to magistrates to hold victory 
marches in cities and towns across the country saturday to 
celebrate the releases 
the new nation a militant opposition newspaper said at least 
250000 people were expected to take part 
police friday lifted restrictions on sisulus wife albertina 
who had been banned from meetings and making public statements 
since february 1988 
mrs sisulu a prominent activist in her own right told 
reporters at her soweto home she would join the planned march in 
johannesburg 
journalists and residents waited outside her house for much of 
the day and police used tear gas to disperse a group of youths 
dancing in the street friday evening 
one young girl was injured and abc news had one of its video 
cassettes confiscated witnesses said 
mrs sisulu said she received some political advice from mandela 
on tuesday when she and other activists met with him at his prison 
quarters near cape town 
now that there are less limitations on my activities i will 
be able to push ahead with the suggestions and advice given to me 
by mandela she said without elaborating 
mrs sisulu is copresident of the banned united democratic 
front a nationwide antiapartheid coalition 
despite her restrictions mrs sisulu 71 was issued a 
shortterm passport by the government this year she and other 
antiapartheid leaders met president bush french president 
francois mitterrand and officials of other western governments 
in addition to sisulu four of the other prisoners to be freed 
were sentenced to life in prison along with mandela at the 
rivonia treason trial in 1964 they are ahmed kathrada 60 elias 
motsoaledi 65 andrew mlengi 63 and mhlaba 69 
also to be freed are african national congress leaders oscar 
mpetha 80 and wilton mkwayi 67 and masemola 60 
all have been imprisoned for 25 years except the ailing mpetha 
who is nearing the end of a fiveyear term 
when they are released the seven african national congress 
members are expected to seek permission to travel to the groups 
headquarters in lusaka zambia 
a leading official of the guerrilla movement said the release of 
the political prisoners shows international pressure is working 
thabo mbeki the groups secretary for international affairs 
said he did not believe the release was a sign of a new spirit of 
conciliation on de klerks part 
i think its a response to pressure he said in an interview 
with the bbc i dont think it signifies that this regime of de 
klerk is any different from the regime of pw botha except that 
the pressures have become so much that it has to yield ground

a yearlong austerity program achieved some 
success in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing 
prices but failed to solve serious defects in state planning a 
report published friday shows 
the official china daily said food retail prices had not risen 
since december but acknowledged that huge government subsidies 
were a main factor in keeping prices down 
the state statistical bureau in a survey of 28 major cities 
found that more than 270 million was spent in the first half of 
the year for pork subsidies and another 54 million for vegetables 
the daily quoted experts as saying the growing subsidies will 
cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities 
to become very unreasonable that will cut the amount of funds 
available for investment 
the austerity program was imposed last fall when the government 
cut off credit to companies outside the state plan suspended new 
building projects cut public spending and reasserted central 
controls over key industries and trade 
conservatives solidified their control after the june military 
crackdown on prodemocracy protesters they support central 
planning are reluctant to tackle economic reforms and stress 
public ownership 
the lot of small industries and private businessmen has become 
increasingly difficult 
the austerity measures were designed in part to control economic 
growth which soared to 207 percent last year to 8 percent in 
1990 economists predict the growth rate will be about 115 percent 
and retail sales will be up only 15 percent compared to a 278 
percent jump in 1988 
the customs administration said restrictions on imports were 
paying off china recorded its first trade surplus of the year in 
september with exports exceeding imports by 345 million on total 
trade of 919 billion 
inflation has almost leveled off and retail prices were up 185 
percent in the first six months of 1989 inflation in urban areas 
was well above 30 percent last year 
the government has yet to solve the problem of factories being 
forced to turn to highpriced free markets for basic materials the 
state is unable to supply 
production costs were up 202 percent in the first eight months 
of the year an 89 percent increase over the same period in 1988 
because of continued supplydemand imbalances 
the state planning commission and other ministries complained 
recently that many staterun factories staggered by rising costs 
are selling their goods on the more profitable free market rather 
than to the state 
smaller locally run firms which have provided the chinese 
economy with its punch in recent years have been hit hard by the 
withdrawal of credit and many are being forced out of business 
the closures have added to the unemployment crisis in the 
countryside where small industries have provided 100 million jobs 
in the past decade 
people are reluctant to return to the land which already faces 
a labor surplus tens of millions have drifted into the cities to 
look for construction work and menial jobs that have dried up under 
the austerity plan 
the government continues to pour large amounts of money into 
large state industries many of which are overstaffed inefficient 
and uncompetitive the bank said total debt owed by state firms to 
banks and other enterprises has reached 293 billion

stock prices tumbled today in the most 
spectacular drop of the year battered by fear of higher inflation 
and word that the united airlines takeover bid may have collapsed 
the speed of the decline spooked traders in a startling reminder 
of the worst stock panic ever almost two years ago on oct 19 
by late afternoon the widely watched dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks had plunged 115 points to the 2645 level by far 
the biggest drop for the index this year other stock indices also 
fell sharply 
if the 115point drop held until closing it would be the fourth 
biggest drop in the dow industrials on record in terms of points 
lost the largest was the 508point drop of oct 19 1987 the 
secondlargest was a 15683point drop a week after that and the 
third largest was a 14058point drop on jan 8 1988 
brokers said the drop was triggered partly by news that a 
labormanagement group failed to secure financing for the proposed 
675 billion takeover of ual corp parent of united airlines ual 
is a component of the dow transportation index 
others said news from the labor department that wholesale prices 
rose sharply in september suggested inflation was accelerating 
reducing the likelihood that the federal reserve would act to ease 
interest rates

police on friday found the body of a 
retired french army general who was reported missing after he 
failed to return home six days ago 
the body of jean favreau the 72yearold former military 
commander of paris was found about 630 pm under a bridge on the 
dordogne river at the village of izon said a spokesman for the

rep bill dickinsons financial dealings with 
an alabama industrialist should be investigated by the house ethics 
committee house republican whip newt gingrich said friday 
but gingrich rga who led the ethics crusade that forced 
democrat jim wright to resign as speaker of the house said he 
wont file an ethics complaint to trigger an investigation of the 
alabama lawmaker the senior republican on the house armed services 
committee 
clearly the ethics committee will look at the case and 
report back gingrich said when asked if he thought dickinson had 
violated house rules by accepting a onethird interest in a 
300000 investment venture funded by ben collier of montgomery 
ala 
i would be very surprised if they didnt issue some kind of 
ruling he said 
gingrich is the target of an ethics complaint filed by rep bill 
alexander dark the complaint alleges that gingrich may have 
violated campaign finance laws limits on outside income and a rule 
preventing acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in 
legislation 
gingrich has denied any violations 
while the ethics committee can initiate an investigation on its 
own the filing of a formal complaint by one member of congress 
against another forces the panel of six democrats and six 
republicans to vote on whether an investigation should be opened 
mike lewis dickinsons press secretary said dickinson had no 
comment on gingrichs statements 
dickinson said in an interview this week that he approached 
collier in 1986 with what i thought was a good business 
opportunity 
he said they formed the montgomery investment club with collier 
supplying the 300000 and dickinson supplying the contacts 
their agreement provided that any profits or losses would go 
onethird to dickinson and twothirds to collier 
house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more 
than 100 from an individual who has a direct interest in 
legislation before congress dickinson contends that rule does not 
cover collier whose companies have done 50 million in government 
defense work since 1987 
dickinson said he never made any money from the investment 
because the 300000 was turned over to steven a streit of 
huntsville ala who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud 
charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison 
streits assets were frozen in 1987 and dickinson said the 
investment club has received about 90 percent of the 300000 from 
a bankruptcy clerk that is serving streits creditors

jessica mcclure says shes doing ok two 
years after her rescue from an abandoned water well 
im fine the 3yearold said in an extremely brief phone 
interview thursday night 
jessica and her parents chip and cissy are doing nothing to 
mark the anniversary of her rescue oct 16 when dozens of 
volunteers helped her out of a well in her aunts back yard the 
toddler cried and softly sang a nursery rhyme while she was wedged 
22 feet underground for 58 hours 
like the mcclure family midland plans no commemorations no 
parades no speeches 
about the closest thing to a celebration will be the handing out 
of the midland community spirit award to recognize a city that 
responded to a person or group in need mayor carroll thomas said 
but the award probably wont be given oct 16 thomas said 
because he and about eight other judges are still looking at the 
70odd entries 
he said the award which was publicized in august in a dear 
abby column will be given soon but set no date 
meanwhile jessica walks just fine her father said although 
her right little toe and the tip of her right big toe were 
amputated after the rescue 
she has no memory of the incident whatsoever he said 
jessica gets one or two cards a day he said 
when jessica was hospitalized after the rescue she was received 
truckloads of cards and gifts of stuffed animals someone donated 
the mcclures a phone answering machine and they were getting 100 
to 200 calls a day 
i really appreciated the outpouring of affection said 
mcclure who with his wife was 18 at the time of the accident 
but truthfully it was a big hassle 
jessica is curious bright and talks well mcclure said adding 
that she doesnt suffer from nightmares or claustrophobia 
the mcclures seemed overwhelmed by the publicity at first but 
the strain did not threaten to split them apart 
if this did anything it strengthened our marriage mcclure 
said

a drifter who won an appeal against his 
conviction for the murder of prime minister olof palme said friday 
he doesnt want to change his identity and prefers to return to the 
easygoing life he had before his arrest 
the 10 months of imprisonment for his interrogation trial and 
appeal had left him unchanged said christer pettersson a day 
after his july conviction was thrown out 
i am what i am and i think im going to be the same said 
pettersson an admitted alcohol and amphetamine abuser who has been 
in and out of jail or mental institutions for years 
pettersson 42 said he turned down offers of police protection 
and help to change his appearance and identity saying he did not 
feel threatened by people who still believed he was palmes killer 
i have already started living as before police had plans for 
me to go away for a few weeks but i must face the world at some 
point anyway he told a crowded news conference in the office of 
his attorney arne liljeros 
what can i do can i live in some other part of the world no 
i dont think so he said 
the appellate court on thursday found the evidence against 
pettersson insufficient his release left police with no suspects 
no new witnesses and no apparent leads to unravel the mystery of 
palmes shooting feb 28 1986 while he walked with his wife on a 
stockholm street 
the investigation of the palme murder will continue said 
state prosecutor axel morath 
the small team of detectives still on the case were focusing 
efforts on finding the missing murder weapon a 357caliber magnum 
pistol or any other forensic evidence said a senior police 
official 
palme dominated swedish politics for nearly two decades and was 
an international figure for socialist causes and nuclear 
disarmament his slaying shocked this nation unaccustomed to street 
violence or political assassination 
palme was shot from close range while he and his wife lisbeth 
walked home from a movie 
pettersson who was sentenced by the district court to life 
imprisonment has maintained his innocence he spent his first 
night of freedom playing cards and drinking with a neighbor 
pettersson has received help from the swedish welfare state 
through an early retirement program often used to support 
drunks or other people considered unemployable 
talkative and joking pettersson fielded questions in swedish 
and english he said he held no rancor toward mrs palme whose 
testimony was the key to the prosections case against him 
though he said he would like to meet mrs palme he admitted it 
would be unlikely but if it would happen i would like to hug 
her i share her loss and do not think she is lying 
mrs palme testified that she saw pettersson when she looked up 
from her dying husband and was 100 percent certain he was the 
gunman 
legal experts said that unequivocal statement would prohibit her 
from testifying against anyone else accused of the crime another 
halfdozen witnesses who claimed to have seen pettersson stalking 
palme on the night of the crime also would be disqualified in any 
future case they said 
mrs palme made no immediate public comment on petterssons 
release

twentytwo moscow managers are in the united 
states to pick up a few tips on capitalism in trip that would have 
been taboo just three years ago 
four senior construction executives said friday the eightweek 
trip is part of their own version of perestroika a bid to 
modernize and restructure moscows infrastructure 
the four are guests of kpmg peat marwick a new yorkbased 
management and consulting firm 
this training is very important said andrei stroyev 42 
head of mosinzhstroy the moscow agency responsible for 
infrastructure construction and rehabilitation it also serves as a 
general contractor in moscow a city of about 8 million residents 
im absolutely sure that this visit is the most important part 
of the whole training process stroyev said friday during a news 
conference here 
the executives are busy touring construction sites and observing 
management and design practices in pittsburgh san francisco 
atlanta miami new york city and neighboring areas 
the trip is paid for with money already earned by perestroika 
joint venture a partnership stroyev formed with the atlantabased 
worsham group inc a development firm building office and living 
space in moscow for foreigners 
stroyev is chairman of the partnership which came into 
existence after soviet officials passed a law in 1987 allowing 
soviet agencies to form joint ventures with foreign companies 
the partnership began four construction projects in moscow this 
year and has received six years rent in cash from their clients 
he said 
the reason why we chose this direction is actually there is 
really a serious shortage of office space shortage of hotels and 
apartments in moscow for foreign communities stroyev said 
this gives us the possibility to invest some hard currency to 
speed up the process of construction and then to get back very good 
return on the investments 
the joint venture also is hoping to put together deals that 
would send moscow construction crews to work on projects in other 
countries he said 
the management training program began in june and july with a 
twomonth series of lectures on us business and culture the 22 
soviet executives visiting the us this month will be followed by 
25 other mosinzhstroy managers in november 
about 150 others lower level managers will visit the us and 
other foreign nations next year 
the four pittsburgh visitors yefim sloutski 50 georgy 
sinitzki 54 vladimir p samoilov 62 and valentin g lerner 53 
all of moscow are tunnel experts who supervise departments of 
about 2500 employees each mosinzhstroy has about 35000 employess

the head of the nations largest bank 
said friday that some bankers feel betrayed by highhanded tactics 
they contend the bush administration is using to push its third 
world debtreduction strategy 
citicorp chairman john reed said the debt initiative unveiled in 
march by treasury secretary nicholas brady had generated enormous 
tension in the banking industry in part because banks werent 
consulted before the plan was put in place 
with no warning and no obvious reason all of a sudden the 
banks are being asked to shoulder serious economic burdens reed 
said 
for those bankers who are walking around feeling there is an 
element of betrayal and highhanded action and lack of consultation 
and so forth there is tons of evidence to support that 
reed who spoke to reporters at the fall meeting of the business 
council did not say that he fully agreed with those feelings 
instead he said he preferred a more benign interpretation of the 
administrations actions 
depending on the way you look at the coin on the one hand you 
could feel betrayal and a change of signals and on the other hand 
you could look and see what is going on as a necessary 
precondition to get this debt crisis behind us he said 
there have been reports of shouting matches between bankers and 
administration officials and a senior treasury official warned 
last week that if commercial banks fail to lend more money to 
mexico the consequences for the banks could be very painful 
the brady plan calls on banks to forgive part of their third 
world loans and to make new loans 
many bankers predict that because the plan envisions substantial 
writeoffs of old debt the banks will turn their backs on the 
third world and refuse to provide the new loans needed to keep 
developing countries afloat 
treasury undersecretary david mulford the chief architect of 
the administrations debt strategy briefed the business council on 
the proposal friday 
afterward in a session with reporters mulford said it was a 
fact of life that the debt strategy is a very difficult problem 
for the banks as well as the debtor countries 
since not everybody can have everything that they want then 
obviously everybody will have some degree of unhappiness he said 
mulford denied that he or others in the administration were 
putting pressure on the banks to go along with debt reduction but 
he said that for banks willing to write off a portion of their old 
debt the brady plan does offer various guarantees through 
international lending agencies that the remaining debt will be 
repaid 
mulford said that negotiations with mexico the first country to 
benefit from the brady plan were on track for completion later 
this year and that talks were also going forward with other 
countries including venezuela 
reed said he believed that the mexican negotiations would result 
in enough banks coming forward with new money to make the plan work 
but that it would not be known for sure until nov 1 the deadline 
for banks to submit their proposals

dissident was killed in an auto accident early friday the 
unofficial news agency expresskhronika reported 
a fellow activist said soviet authorities had threatened 
kostavas life 
kostava was riding with two other georgian proindependence 
activists on a deserted wet road when the accident occurred and he 
was killed the news agency said tamara chkheidze who was 
driving and zurab chavchavadze were hospitalized with serious 
injuries it said 
no further details were available immediately 
zviad gamsakhurdia considered the dean of dissidents in the 
southern soviet republic said kostava had received death threats 
during the summer and last week 
a week ago we were warned by one kgb man that we shall be 
killed in the nearest future merab kostava and i gamsakhurdia 
said in a telephone interview from tbilisi capital of the black 
sea republic 
gamsakhurdia said he also was told last summer that all leaders 
of georgian independence movement would be killed by oct 15 
the threats came from the military staff and the military 
intelligence service gamsakhurdia said adding that he and other 
dissidents were so concerned that they hired private guards for 
their homes 
during the summer gamsakhurdia said a grenade exploded outside 
his home 
news of kostavas death came after business hours and soviet 
officials could not be reached for comment 
nationalist fervor has run high in georgia since spring when 20 
people were killed by soviet soldiers sent in to halt the unrest a 
recent report by a georgian commission implicated defense minister 
dmitri t yazov and former kgb chief victor m chebrikov in the 
plan to send the soldiers 
gamsakhurdia said an impromptu gathering friday night in 
downtown tbilisi was turning into a memorial for kostava 
kostava aged 59 or 60 was first arrested on political charges 
in 1956 according to a brief obituary carried by expresskhronika 
he served several terms in prison camps and internal exile for 
political activities and even in the camps he continued his 
human rights work the obituary said kostava was released in 
spring 1987 in a widespread amnesty for political prisoners 
until his last days merab kostava remained one of the leaders 
of the georgian human rights movement said expresskhronika a 
former underground network now permitted to operate openly 
kostava was a member of the georgian helsinki watch group and a 
leader of the holy ilya society a religiousnationalist group 
prominent in the agitation for georgian independence 
georgia a sunny mountainous republic in the caucasus region 
became part of the soviet union in 1920 only a handful of 
proindependence dissidents were active a year ago but the 
movement has gained strength since spring 
thousands gathered in tbilisi on wednesday night to call for 
independence protest the military draft and urge an election

israel is trying to exclude plo members from 
mideast negotiations and to limit any talks with palestinians to 
the mechanics of conducting elections on the west bank and gaza 
diplomatic sources said friday 
the sources commented as secretary of state james a baker iii 
pressed an effort to arrange a threeway meeting in washington its 
main purpose would be to select palestinians for talks with israel 
about elections in the territories 
baker talked by telephone again on thursday with egyptian 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and has had several 
conversations with israeli foreign minister moshe arens the us 
campaign was put on hold at least so far as jerusalem is 
concerned for the sabbath and the celebration of the jewish 
holiday of sukkot which began friday evening 
with baker making little apparent progress margaret d 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman insisted he had set no 
time limit on his effort there is no date certain there is no 
deadline she told reporters 
ms tutwiler and other us officials declined to provide any 
details of bakers conversations with abdelmeguid and with arens 
i am not authorized she said 
but baker is known to have presented the foreign ministers a 
week ago with a fivepoint proposal that includes israel holding 
talks with palestinians only if it is satisfied with the 
composition of the delegation 
still arens is insisting that all members of the palestine 
liberation organization whose covenant calls for the dismantling 
of israel as a jewish state be barred palestinians who are 
sympathetic to plo positions would be eligible however 
the meeting baker is promoting is designed to blend prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs proposal for elections with a 10point 
formula by egyptian president hosni mubarak this is proving to be 
very difficult 
mubarak after consulting with the plo wants the delegation to 
include two palestinians who were deported from the west bank and 
gaza during a 22month rebellion against israeli control 
shamir and arens both members of the likud coalition are 
opposed to the proposition as well as to mubaraks demand that 
israel agree in advance it will surrender territory as part of an 
overall settlement 
arens is also insisting that israels talks with the 
palestinians be limited to making arrangements for the elections 
and not serve as a forum for negotiating palestinian demands 
baker on the other hand would permit the palestinians to raise 
whatever concerns they might have about the election plan 
shamirs proposals provides for the elected palestinians to 
negotiate with israel arrangements for five years of limited 
selfrule to be followed by wider negotiations on an overall 
settlement

president bush denied friday that he was 
angered over internal secondguessing about the failed panamanian 
coup 
there have been reports the president told his staff to stop 
leaking postmortem criticisms to reporters 
bush saying that hes changed from the days when his 
frustrations gave him ulcers denied any gag order saying he 
only wanted to avoid any appearance he was criticizing his team 
they all did a good job he said at a news conference 
but the president immediately indicated there might have been 
something that riled him a bit 
normally i might get a little more tense i wouldnt blow up 
i dont think and thats why i had ulcers 20 years ago because i 
didnt i kept it all inside but i learned now to get out there 
and do your best get the best information that you can and have 
confidence in good people bush said 
many members of congress criticized bush for not coming to the 
aid of dissident panamanian military officers who tried to 
overthrow gen manuel antonio noriega on oct 3 
privately administration officials have said they were things 
that could have been handled differently and that problems such as 
information flow hampered quick decision making bush has denied 
that was the case but officials have said that procedures are 
under review 
other criticisms included statements that a key cable was 
garbled regarding whether the insurgents would turn noriega over to 
the united states and that there had been insufficient attention to 
communication links with the coup leaders 
there wasnt a gag order and i didnt get angry what i 
did say is i dont want to see any blame coming out of the oval 
office or attributed to the oval office in the face of criticism 
he told a news conference 
i havent lost any confidence in our top people that are 
handling these matters bush said 
bush had a bleeding ulcer when he was in the oil business in his 
early 30s his doctor told him you try to do too much and you 
worry too much bush wrote in his autobiography looking 
forward 
all my life id worked at channelling my emotions trying not 
to let anger or frustration influence my thinking but id never 
given much thought to channelling my energies that would change

a former top aide at the department of housing 
and urban development used her office to raise money for a charity 
and targeted her appeal to consultants who did business with the 
agency documents in her files indicate 
deborah gore deans files show that when she sought donations 
for a red cross event in 1984 she listed her hud telephone number 
on her letters and asked that responses be phoned in to her 
secretary 
a hud attorney who discussed the issue friday on the condition 
of anonymity said deans action appeared to violate agency 
standards prohibiting the use of an office for private gain as well 
as rules against the misuse of government workers 
one of deans lawyers however disputed those assertions 
there is absolutely no evidence that deborah dean gained 
anything from her service on behalf of a nationally recognized 
charity attorney charles leeper said and im certainly 
unaware of any regulation that makes the use of a secretarys time 
unlawful and the files reflect that the secretary spent an 
immaterial amount of her time on behalf of this charitable 
organization 
the fundraising letters for a new years eve ball were sent to 
a number of developers and consultants who did hudrelated work 
including former agency officials joseph strauss and r carter 
sanders former interior secretary james watt and washington 
attorney david barrett whose law partners include at least two 
former hud officials also solicited was edward wiedenfeld an 
adviser to the 1980 reaganbush campaign who is a partner in 
several hud developments 
copies of the letters in deans files show that while she listed 
her home address on the letters and used blank stationery she gave 
her hud phone number and said those wishing to attend should 
contact sherrill nettles her secretary 
dean was a member of young friends of red cross which sponsored 
the ball 
her files were released recently under the freedom of 
information act her efforts on behalf of the red cross were first 
reported thursday by the boston herald 
dean who has refused to testify before a congressional inquiry 
is a central figure in its investigation of allegations of 
influence peddling fraud and mismanagement at hud during the 
reagan administration and the tenure of her boss former hud 
secretary samuel pierce he too has refused to testify as has 
deans predecessor as pierces executive assistant lance wilson 
dean is the second former hud official whose charity work has 
been questioned former hud assistant secretary thomas demery was 
sharply criticized in a hud audit for attending several 
fundraisers attended by hud developers and consultants for a 
charity he helped establish 
the justice department declined to prosecute demery in 
connection with the charity work which huds inspector general 
said appeared to present a conflict of interest because many of the 
donors or their clients received lucrative subsidies from the 
housing agency

the justice department on friday obtained at 
least another months delay in the irancontra trial of former cia 
agent joseph f fernandez while it ponders how to deal with secrecy 
issues in the case 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond granted the 
departments request for a months time to consider whether it 
wanted to appeal its ruling that attorney general dick thornburgh 
couldnt intervene on secrecy issues in the fernandez case 
the delay until nov 13 gives thornburgh more time to consider 
how to deal with the politically touchy secrecy issues surrounding 
the fernandez case 
a threejudge panel of the court ruled sept 29 that thornburgh 
could not appeal secrecy rulings made by the trial judge because 
such intervention would undermine the independence of irancontra 
prosecutor lawrence e walsh 
the court held that thornburghs only recourse was to file an 
affidavit under the classified information procedures act blocking 
the release of information the trial judge ruled could be disclosed 
in court by fernandezs defense lawyers such an action would 
likely result in dismissal of the charges 
the justice department has said such an affidavit would be filed 
only as a last resort 
the justice department had until friday to notify the 4th 
circuit of whether it wanted a rehearing of the case by the full 
court in richmond 
in the request for an extension of the filing deadline 
assistant attorney general edward sg dennis jr said the courts 
ruling was of substantial importance to the attorney general and 
the department of justice in addressing national security matters 
arising in the context of cases prosecuted by independent counsel 
accordingly it is necessary for the department of justice to 
consider what if any further measures are appropriate in light of 
the decision dennis said 
fernandez the former cia station chief in costa rica is 
accused of lying to cia superiors and to a presidential commission 
that investigated the irancontra affair about his role in setting 
up an airstrip for the clandestine armssupply network for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
he was originally set to go to trial in july in us distict 
court in alexandria va 
but the justice department halted the trial by appealing rulings 
by us district judge claude hilton that the locations of several 
cia stations in central america could be disclosed by fernandez as 
part of his defense 
the 4th circuit stayed the trial while it considered the justice 
departments appeal but the panel ruled that only the independent 
counsel could file appeals of trial court rulings under the secrecy 
law 
with such power the attorney general could control the 
prosecution directly by breaking off proceedings and appealing at 
will the court said 
the specter of such successive appeals might hamper the 
prosecution making it difficult for independent counsel to 
coordinate and discharge his statutory obligations the judges 
ruled

stock prices tumbled and the dow jones 
industrial average plummeted 197 points today in the most 
spectacular drop since the 1987 crash battered by fear of 
inflation and word the united airlines buyout may have collapsed 
the speed of the friday the 13th decline which came just four 
days after the dow set a record high spooked traders in a 
startling reminder of the worst stock panic ever almost two years 
ago on oct 19 
at the closing bell the unofficial tally of the widely watched 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks had plunged to around 
256250 by far the biggest drop for the index this year and 
second only to the crash of 1987 in terms of points lost 
thursdays close was 275984 
its total emotional and psychological chaos said eugene 
peroni an analyst with janney montgomery scott in philadelphia 
people are dumping everything a great deal of money is being 
lost 
when the dow dropped 508 points on oct 19 1987 closing at 
173874 it represented a loss of 226 percent of the indexs 
value in one day todays drop was about 7 percent 
other stock indices also fell sharply today the new york stock 
exchanges composite index tumbled 1143 to 18555 at the american 
stock exchange the market value index was down 1656 at 37845 
bond prices rose dramatically as investors sought a safe haven for 
their money in the credit markets 
big board volume totaled 25117 million shares the heaviest 
total since 25487 million were traded jan 27 
just monday the index closed at an alltime high of 279141 
that had been the fifth straight trading day to post a record high 
close 
the secondlargest dow plunge on record until today was a 
15683point drop on oct 26 1987 which brought the average to 
179393 the third largest was a 14058point drop on jan 8 
1988 when the dow industrials closed at 191131 
brokers said todays drop was triggered partly by news that a 
labormanagement group failed to secure financing for the proposed 
675 billion takeover of ual corp parent of united airlines ual 
is a component of the dow transportation index 
others pointed to troubles in the junk bond market where a 
heavy supply of new issues coupled with investor skittishness has 
severely crimped investors appetite for the highrisk issues 
the ual news combined with recent worries about the junk bond 
market seemed to trigger a selling panic said hildegarde 
zagorski an analyst at prudentialbache securities inc she said 
that program selling accelerated the drop 
still others said news from the labor department that wholesale 
prices rose sharply in september suggested inflation was heating up 
again reducing the likelihood that the federal reserve would act 
to ease interest rates 
at 2 pm edt the dow was off about 23 points but an 
overwhelming tailspin pushed the key index down an additional 100 
points in little more than an hour 
the drop is eerily reminiscent of a 108point dow drop on a 
friday exactly two years ago which proved to be a harbinger of the 
centurys second stock market disaster when trading resumed the 
following monday oct 19 1987 the dow plunged a whopping 508 
points 
zagorski said she did not expect the events of 1987 to be 
repeated its not going to go down too much further from these 
levels she said shortly before the market closed 
the worst drop so far this year occurred on march 17 when the 
dow lost about 48 points

the georges pompidou center closed for two weeks 
because of a janitors strike will reopen this weekend but only 
after it has been thoroughly cleaned the museum director said 
friday 
the cultural complex a hulking metal structure with giant blue 
and white pipes running along its facade has been forced to turn 
away thousands of visitors as mountains of refuse and garbage piled 
up inside and out 
the cleaning personnel who work for four companies went on 
strike sept 30 demanding higher wages and representation by a 
single body 
museum director helene arhweiler said in a statement that the 
entire center was to be disinfected before opening its doors to 
the public but she strongly urged visitors to help keep it 
clean 
she said the strike was not completely settled and that the 
agreement reached late thursday with the strikers provided for 
minimum service 
she said the decision to disinfect the center was made after the 
head of hygiene of the city of paris called the sanitary conditions 
not at all satisfactory 
the center normally draws 25000 people daily to a wide variety 
of activities but was built originally to handle 5000 visitors

president bush sought room for flexibility 
friday to avoid vetoing a bill that allows more medicaid abortions 
but both sides of the politically explosive issue offered little 
hope for compromise 
im not looking for any conflict over this bush said at a 
news conference im not going to change my position any but 
lets see how those negotiations come out 
white house officials met with capitol hill republicans in an 
attempt to find a way out for the president a top gop 
congressional aide said 
but with abortionrights forces claiming the political momentum 
was on their side antiabortion leaders turned up the heat on the 
president by demanding a veto of the measure permitting federally 
financed abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest 
the movement will expect a presidential veto and if he 
doesnt veto it theyre going to have a real mess on their 
hands said gary bauer president of the family research council 
and a former domestic policy adviser in the reagan white house 
this is a time of testing for the white house bauer said 
people will be watching quite carefully to see if the white house 
lessens its commitment on the abortion issue and if there is any 
sign it is shifting there will be an incredible political 
firestorm for the republicans 
neither side in congress publicly offered a compromise 
democrats acknowledged they didnt have the votes to override a 
veto 
bush said he had not wavered in his opposition to a provision 
passed by the house on wednesday and earlier by the senate that 
would drop a decadelong ban on federally funded abortions for poor 
women who are victims of rape or incest 
but he stopped short of repeating his veto threat saying there 
was negotiation and discussion under way that could lead to a 
compromise that would avert a veto 
abortionrights forces contend that public opinion polls show 
increasing numbers of voters support broader abortion rights and 
that a bush veto would be politically costly for the president and 
lawmakers who voted with him 
asked if he was leaving open the possibility he would not veto 
the measure bush said well because im told that the 
conference language may be able to avoid a veto on my part 
well see what we can do in terms of the conference committee 
to see if there is room for flexibility bush said 
rep les aucoin dore a leader of the abortionrights forces 
called bushs remarks unintelligible politically and said his 
side is unwilling to compromise 
there are no negotiations going on with those of us who 
asserted the right to choose and won last week there is no 
compromise on the table aucoin said in a telephone interview 
from oregon 
the legislation is part of a broader fiscal 1990 spending bill 
for the departments of labor and health and human services 
the measure was sent back to the senate for agreement on a 
separate provision but the house language on abortion was 
identical to that already approved by the senate 
it would expand current law that permits medicaid abortions only 
in cases where the life of the mother is endangered the new 
provision would still prevent medicaid funding of abortions in most 
cases but would allow it in cases of rape and incest if the victim 
promptly reported it 
although bush referred to possible change in conference 
language the bill has already been reported by house and senate 
conferees and goes back to the senate which could send it directly 
to bush 
most house members had already returned to their districts as 
the house held only a proforma session friday 
an aide to the senate democratic leadership declining to be 
identified said there were no talks under way involving senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine who a day earlier pleaded 
with bush not to veto the measure 
on the other side of the issue spokesmen for rep christopher 
smith rnj cochairman of the house prolife caucus and rep 
henry hyde rill long the sponsor of the abortion restriction 
legislation said they had no compromise in mind 
doug johnson lobbyist for the national right to life committee 
the leading antiabortion group said he didnt believe theres 
any way to avoid a veto of this bill 
house republican leader bob michel suggested thursday that 
specifying a time limit for reporting by the victim might be a 
compromise but johnson said that was unacceptable 
rep barbara boxer dcalif said bush was searching for a way 
to weaken his opposition in light of a changing political climate 
since last summers supreme court ruling in the missouri case that 
made increased state regulation of abortion possible 
since the webster case george bush has backed out of 
intervening in most abortion cases before the supreme court she 
said i believe he will back out of this veto

the opposition socialist party said on friday that 
no such thing as a pachinko scandal existed 
socialist legislators stand accused of accepting bribes from 
pinball parlor owners to lighten up on regulations restricting the 
lightup industry 
the governing liberal democratic party raised the allegation in 
parliament wednesday following reports in the shukan bunshun 
magazine suggesting that money from japanesestyle pinball called 
pachinko had infiltrated politics 
i would like to express regret for causing concern among the 
people in the socalled pachinko scandal tsuruo yamaguchi 
secretarygeneral of the socialist party told a news conference 
but we would like to clarify that no such thing as the 
pachinko scandal exists and it is no more than an illusion created 
by shukan bunshun 
yamaguchi acknowledged nine party lawmakers received 55000 in 
donations from the pachinko association but said the donations 
were legal and no member tilted toward the industry 
our investigation found no trace of wrongdoing he added 
receiving donations from industry is common and legal in japan 
as long as recipients do no favors in return 
the socialist party said it investigated claims that several of 
its legislators used their influence to water down bills regulating 
the pachinko business in exchange for donations ranging from 1400 
to 3500 
yamaguchi also said the party is still investigating news 
reports that a socialist legislator received donations from a 
pronorth korea organization called the association of korean 
residents in japan 
receiving donations from foreigners and foreign organizations 
violates the political fund control law most of the 700000 
koreans in japan are not japanese citizens and are divided into 
associations that favor communist north or capitalist prowest 
south korea 
koreans are major operators in pachinko a widely played form of 
pinball in which winners receive prizes about 15000 pachinko 
parlors are strung across japan with annual sales estimated at 21 
billion according to industry sources 
yamaguchi acknowledged that the national pachinko parlor owners 
association bought 31000 worth of tickets for a fundraising 
party of socialist party chairwoman takako doi a pachng of declines

terry waites relatives said friday they still 
hold hope the anglican church envoy will be freed and vigils were 
held at several cathedrals to mark sunday which will be his 
1000th day as a hostage in lebanon 
i really do think that he is still alive i feel he is said 
waites mother lena waite he would hate to be shut up like that 
but i am sure he will come through all right 
his cousin john waite said that as time goes on it becomes 
more difficult to believe waite is alive 
however john waite added he is such a nice genuine guy i 
cannot imagine even a desperado wanting to do him any harm 
the church army the church of englands evangelical branch 
organized prayer vigils at the cathedrals of winchester bristol 
liverpool rochester and londons southwark 
waite was in lebanon trying to negotiate freedom for other 
western hostages when he disappeared on jan 20 1987 
he is among 18 foreigners missing in lebanon they include eight 
americans four britons two west germans two swiss and italian 
and an irishman 
most of the foreign hostages are believed held by proiranian 
shiite moslem underground factions 
held longest is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
prime minister margaret thatcher addressing the conservative 
party conference in blackpool recalled the plight of waite and the 
two other british hostages 
we think of terry waite brian keenan john mccarthy and of 
their families and friends who endure so much 
any government which has influence over those who hold 
hostages should be ready as a matter of course to use that 
influence to bring about their release mrs thatcher said 
a country cannot support terrorism and still expect to be 
treated as a member of the international community to take 
hostages is to exclude yourself from the civilized world

us arms negotiator edward l rowny 
briefed solidarity lawmakers friday on disarmament talks with the 
soviet union and met with lech walesa leader of the independent 
union 
walesa said he told rowny after their meeting it would be good 
for all of us if we changed several tanks to bread 
discussions of eastwest weapons levels the us approach to 
talks with the soviets and other defense topics were an added sign 
change in poland the only warsaw pact nation with a noncommunist 
government 
we feel it very important that people understand our points of 
view and that we seek their support rowny said 
the american arms negotiator whose father was born in poland 
arrived tuesday for official meetings and a lecture at jagellonian 
university in krakow where he studied in 1936 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a solidarity activist has 
promised allegiance to the sovietled military alliance but rowny 
envisaged a growing role for poland in the warsaw pact as a voice 
in changes and reductions to come 
we see a greater influence in the warsaw pact of the poles 
than there used to be and we think thats good and encourage that 
and look for even more progress in the future he said 
we think that the government is playing a very prudent role 
and is able to have a voice is able to do things within the 
warsaw pact that it didnt think it could in the past and has 
enough freedom of action 
rowny said the soviets accept us efforts to aid political and 
economic reform in poland 
there is certainly no prohibition or inhibition that we can 
see to us assistance to poland politically or economically he 
said there is no increase in tensions between ourselves and the 
soviets because of our frank and candid announcements that we are 
going to help the poles

hardliner erich honecker on friday rejected talks 
with the east german opposition but officials of his regime 
announced they had freed prodemocracy activists from jail and 
would let hundreds more refugees go west 
for the first time a highranking east german official spoke 
openly when asked about a possible resignation by the 77yearold 
honecker 
a spokeswoman for chancellor helmut kohls office in bonn said 
an east german diplomat told the government late friday that east 
german refugees at the west germany embassy in warsaw would be 
afforded passage to west germany 
the spokeswoman who confirmed an east berlin report said it 
was not clear when the more than 600 refugees in warsaw would be 
transported out of poland she spoke to the associated press on 
condition of anonymity 
west germanys zdf tv network reported from warsaw that buses 
were arranged for the refugees but no firm plans were announced 
for their departure 
in east berlin the state news agency adn announced that all but 
11 of the estimated 1000 protesters jailed after prodemocracy 
demonstrations last week and on monday were released it said 11 
people charged with violent acts during the demonstrations remained 
in jail and would face trial 
dietmar keller the secondranking official in the east german 
culture ministry told reporters in wolfenbuettel west germany 
as for erich honeckers resignation erich honecker must make 
that decision all alone 
he said any decision would require a meeting of the party 
central committee and i dont know if a meeting is planned or 
already called 
honecker himself recuperating from recent gallbladder surgery 
said friday after meeting with leaders of political parties allied 
with the communists we dont need suggestions for the 
improvement of socialism that are really intended to cause its 
demise 
it was his toughest statement yet on opposition movements which 
have grown in strength at time of unrest at home and flight to the 
west by tens of thousands of young skilled workers 
a communist party position paper called opposition groups 
enemies of the socialist order 
east german opposition leader werner fischer said in a telephone 
interview with west germanys ard television the communist party 
is only open to reforms as long as its own power is assured 
honeckers political future remained the subject of speculation 
some reports have said he is about to be removed from office 
die welt a newspaper based in bonn quoted west german interior 
minister wolfgang schaeuble as saying east germany was in a 
prerevolutionary state 
as of friday honeckers picture had not appeared in the 
communist party newspaper neues deutschland for three days but 
state tv did show footage of him greeting the political delegation 
friday 
wolfgang seiffert a former adviser to honecker who defected to 
west germany said in west berlin the majority of the politburo 
blames honecker for the current crisis 
in his remarks friday honecker urged east germans to work 
together for continuity and renewal through deepseated change 
and reform an apparent response to the public demand he made 
clear however that the leading role of the party would remain 
intact 
echoing an earlier politburo statement about the flight to the 
west he said it must concern us all when our citizens for 
whatever reasons turn their backs on their country open dialogue 
is necessary to make socialism more and more attractive 
growing discontent has forced the leadership to adopt a more 
conciliatory line ranking officials have indicated there could be 
changes in the rigidly controlled media but sharp attacks continue 
to be aimed at opposition groups 
the party position paper said open and hidden enemies of the 
socialist order could create a mass movement at odds with the 
government

a former reagan administration official won 
approval of a multimilliondollar project a month before the 
application was filed after appealing directly to hud secretary 
samuel pierce a house subcommittee was told friday 
former general services administrator gerald carmen said that 
since its approval in early 1987 the arlington texas project has 
returned 800000 in profits to him through upfront tax credits 
without risking any of his own money 
im a little surprised at the way it went and i find myself a 
little uncomfortable at the position im in now carmen told the 
employment and housing panel of the house government operations 
committee 
frankly it embarasses me 
carmen said he saw the 316unit pebble creek moderate 
rehabilitation program project as an opportunity to both make 
money and do some good by providing rentsubsidized housing for 
poor people 
the onetime manchester nh businessman carmen got to know 
pierce during the transition between the carter and reagan 
administrations in late 1980 and early 1981 
carmen was a member of reagans transition team for the 
department of housing and urban development and pierce 
subsequently was named to head the agency 
carmen was appointed by reagan to head the general services 
administration which is responsible for building or leasing most 
government offices and acting as a supply officer for much of the 
federal bureaucracy 
he held the gsa post until 1984 when reagan named him us 
ambassador to united nations agencies in geneva switzerland about 
six months after resigning in 1986 carmen said he learned of the 
texas project 
carmen said arlington housing officials were unaware of the 
potential for a rehabilitation grant until after he tried to 
persuade them to submit an application 
i made it plain at that discussion there were no guarantees at 
all he said 
carmen said he met with pierce in pierces office for about 15 
minutes in late january 1987 telling him that the city of 
arlington would be submitting an application and that he hoped it 
would get proper consideration 
i recall that i did not ask him for a decision and he did not 
give me one he said adding that he talked with no one else in 
pierces office about the project 
carmen said he didnt know of the projects approval by hud 
until late april when the arlington public housing authority was 
notified 
the subcommittee however revealed a march 4 memo from 
thenfederal housing administrator thomas demery to deborah gore 
dean pierces executive assistant on funding decisions that 
included a handwritten message adding the 316 pebble creek units 
this is the first time ive seen this carmen told the 
subcommittees chairman rep tom lantos dcalif 
carmen declined to agree with an assertion by rep ted weiss 
dny that his meeting with pierce was the sole factor behind the 
favorable action on pebble creek 
i dont want to concede that although i do concede thats the 
way it looks carmen said thats what thousands of people do 
in washington making sure that things dont slip between the 
cracks 
lantos then unveiled a memo from ms dean to pierce dated april 
7 two weeks before the city submitted a formal application 
stating and carmen are set 
lantos said the combination of the memos and carmens testimony 
contradicts an assertion by pierce before the subcommittee last 
spring that he took no part in hud funding decisions 
the subcommittee has subpoenaed pierce to testify before the 
panel again later this month and in november in his last 
appearance in september pierce took his fifth amendment rights on 
selfincrimination and refused to answer questions 
pebble creek was developed as a limited partnership between 
carmen and joshua muss a law partner of carmens daughter 
carmen and muss used hud guaranteed mortgages to borrow 82 
million 4 million for buying a rundown apartment complex and 4 
million to upgrade it and sharing in 24 million in upfront tax 
credits plus 18 million in annual hud rent subsidies 
the project surfaced in an audit by huds inspector general in 
april as an example of underwriters escalating the value of 
projects in coinsuring their mortgages with fha

the food and drug administration said friday 
it plans to withdraw bolar pharmaceutical cos approval to sell a 
generic drug used to treat urinary tract infections and it wants 
the company to withdraw the product from drugstores 
in a letter to the company the fda said tests on samples of 
bolars drug and the brandname drug strongly suggest that 
norwicheatons macrodantin product was substituted for bolars 
product in tests required for fda approval 
the fda is also moving to change its listing of bolars version 
of macrodantin generically called nitrofurantoin to indicate to

a justice department ruling that authorizes 
the fbi to arrest us fugitives overseas without the permission of 
foreign countries drew quick signals of displeasure friday from the 
state department 
this is a very narrow legal opinion based on consideration 
only of domestic united states law said secretary of state james 
a baker iii 
it did not take into account international law nor did it 
weigh the presidents constitutional responsibility to carry out 
the foreign policy of the united states 
in a brief exchange with reporters baker added this procedure 
will not be used absent a full interagency discussion of all the 
foreign policy implications 
the white house issued a statement echoing bakers remarks and 
saying there will be no arrests abroad that have not been 
considered through that interagency process 
earlier spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the legal opinion 
by the justice departments office of legal counsel did not 
necessarily mean president bush would authorize such arrests to 
take place 
it is important to isolate the above question of whether 
domestic legal authority might exist from the question of whether 
the president will in fact authorize the use of that authority 
ms tutwiler said 
in any given case the president must weigh his responsibility 
for managing both foreign affairs and law enforcement said 
tutwiler who noted that baker only learned of it this morning 
in news accounts 
bush too had not been informed of the justice departments 
ruling said an administration source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the president was caught off guard when asked about the ruling 
following its disclosure in friday editions of the los angeles 
times 
im embarrassed to say i dont know what it is ill have to 
get back to you with your question the president told reporters 
justice department spokesman david runkel said that people at 
the white house and other parts of the government have been 
informed through the process in drawing up this opinion 
asked why bush and baker did not know about the opinion runkel 
said their lawyers did 
our job is to provide legal advice and thats what weve 
done he said 
the opinion changing a 9yearold justice department policy on 
the fbis arrest powers overseas was issued june 21 by assistant 
attorney general william barr 
the fbi said it had taken no action under the ruling nor would 
any such arrests be made without an interagency review 
the bureau said it requested the opinion to clarify its 
authority to arrest a number of fugitives at large overseas who are 
being sought on such charges as hijacking hostage taking and other 
terrorist acts 
this advice along with many other factors will be considered 
in the devlopment of any plan to apprehend fugitives abroad the 
fbi said in a statement 
asked if the opinion sanctioned kidnapping attorney general 
dick thornburgh said we dont see it that way 
on capitol hill rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the 
house judiciary committees constitutional rights subcommittee 
said he would hold hearings on the policy which he said would 
make us an international brigand an international outlaw 
ms tutwilers comments signaled that the state department would 
seek to influence any presidential decision to allow the fbi to 
circumvent a foreign countrys extradition procedures to make such 
an arrest 
one of the diplomatic concerns is that the arrest of a us 
fugitive in foreign territory without the countrys permission 
could provoke a reciprocal action 
the ruling could conceivably be used by the fbi to arrest 
panamaniam strongman gen manuel noriega and bring him to trial in 
florida on drug trafficking charges 
barrs finding reversed a policy dating back to the carter 
administration that specifically prohibited the fbi from 
circumventing extradition procedures in a foreign country 
the 1980 policy was issued in response to an fbi proposal to 
kidnap fugitive financier robert l vesco from the bahamas vesco 
who is still at large is accused of milking hundreds of millions 
of dollars from mutual funds before fleeing the country in 1973 
federal laws enacted by congress in 1984 and 1986 gave us 
authorities jurisdiction to prosecute acts of terrorism involving 
american citizens overseas including airplane hijackings and 
killings carried out to coerce a government 
but those laws did not confer on us law enforcement agencies 
the power to make arrests in other countries without the permission 
of foreign governments 
the fbi went to great lengths in 1987 to lure convicted hijacker 
fawaz younis to a yacht in international waters off cyprus to 
arrest him for leading a 1985 hijacking of a jordanian airliner 
carrying several us citizens 
younis a lebanese was recently sentenced to 30 years 
imprisonment for the hijacking which began in beirut

the chairman of the house subcommittee on 
asian and pacific affairs on friday proposed a major role for the 
united nations to halt bloodshed in cambodia and break the deadlock 
over proposals for a political settlement 
the current reluctance of vietnam and other countries to 
compromise on an overall solution for the southeast asian country 
points to a period over the next several months in which each 
side tests itself on the battlefield said the chairman rep 
stephen solarz dny 
he also opposed normalizing us relations with vietnam so long 
as hanoi remains uncompromising about cambodia but said 
washington should be prepared to normalize and begin a new 
chapter if and when vietnam is prepared to cooperate in the search 
for settlement of the cambodian problem 
solarz presented his cambodian settlement formula in an 
appearance before the washington foreign correspondents 
association it would be based on a unsupervised interim 
administration perhaps along the lines of the unsupervised 
administration in namibia the southwest african territory now 
in transition from south african rule to independence 
the threat of revived civil war in cambodia resulted from 
failure of an international conference in paris last august to 
agree on an overall political solution 
withdrawal a month later of vietnamese forces that occupied 
cambodia for 11 years has triggered moves for a return to power by 
the communist khmer rouge blamed for more than a million cambodian 
deaths during their 197578 rule solarz termed a khmer rouge 
return politically and morally unacceptable to the united 
states 
a cambodian solution under the un flag would respond to the 
various concerns that deadlocked the paris conference solarz 
said it could be more politically acceptable than any formula on 
the table so far

a dutch university is recruiting 
volunteers for a program commissioned by the us government to 
test the skills of drivers under the influence of marijuana a 
researcher said friday 
the twoyear limburg university project will be conducted on a 
closedoff section of highway and will be the first to involve the 
actual use of automobiles by drivers who have smoked the drug 
researcher han de gier said 
he said the purpose of the research commissioned by the us 
department of transportation is to determine as realistically as 
possible how marijuana affects a drivers skill and behavior 
marijuana is not believed to be addictive but has been blamed 
for loss of concentration lower reaction speed and even brain 
damage and hallucinations in some users 
its effects on drivers have been investigated only under 
laboratory conditions de gier said in an interview 
de gier said most of those tests had shown a negative effect on 
performance 
motorists who smoke marijuana often drink alcohol as well 
making it difficult to pinpoint the specific cause of an accident 
he said 
no figures on drugrelated auto accidents were available from 
the dutch government 
volunteers in the program to be supervised by health 
authorities and the prosecutors office will be closely screened 
and known drug dealers will be barred the university said 
well need to be sure subjects use marijuana regularly at 
least once a month an announcement said a certain amount of 
driving experience will also be required 
de gier denied the choice of holland as a site was related to 
the countrys liberal attitudes toward drug use 
possession of up to 50 grams 175 ounces of hashish or 
marijuana is a minor offense in holland punishable by a 
seldomimposed maximum fine of 50 guilders 18 both drigs are 
available in hundreds of coffee houses in amsterdam alone 
dutch law forbids driving under the influence of any substance 
that could impair a drivers skills but specifically mentions only 
alcohol 
according to limburg university figures 10 to 15 percent of all 
citizens under age 18 have smoked marijuana at least once and 5 
percent are regular users 
in the united states up to onefourth of high school and 
college students smoke marijuana regularly the university 
announcement said 
marijuana is derived from the cannabis plant hashish which 
contains the same active chemicals in a more concentrated form is 
made from cannabis resin

the syrian pilot who defected to israel 
said friday he was willing to chance flying his sovietbuilt mig23 
fighter over israels border missile batteries for a chance at 
freedom 
maj mohammed bassam adel told a news conference arranged by the 
israeli army that he sometimes flew at just under 100 feet as he 
crossed into israel at high speed over the golan heights last 
wednesday 
it was a difficult mission i didnt know where i was going to 
land i didnt know if i would find a facility to land i was going 
into the unknown the 34yearold flyer said 
the section i was crossing was spread all over with missiles 
adel said he flew at 700 to 750 mph and below 50 meters 
sometimes 30 meters sometimes 40 
a meter equals 33 feet 
the darkhaired pilot chainsmoked during the news conference at 
a military base near tel aviv he wore an olivegreen syrian flight 
suit adel spoke in arabic with israeli officers translating his 
words into english no tape recorders or cameras were allowed 
much criticism has been expressed in israel over adels ability 
to fly into israel without being intercepted 
asked about this adel said his own warning system indicated he 
was observed though he said earlier he switched off his 
electronic gear to fly in silence 
he said the thought of being intercepted entered my mind but 
added i feel that a country which has confidence cannot be 
afraid of one single airplane and would take time to evaluate the 
meaning of whats going on before taking action 
syria has claimed adel did not defect but landed in israel 
because his plane had technical problems it asked the 
international committee of the red cross to help return the pilot 
and aircraft 
but adel said he did not want to return home 
if the red cross wants to meet me and take me back to syria i 
would refuse this he said 
adel refused to answer most questions on politics but said 
syrias pilots considered israels air force better than their own 
no one in the syrian air force feels that they could defeat 
israel that they are superior to israel he said 
the pilot said he had no contacts with israelis before he landed 
at megiddo 57 miles north of jerusalem nobody was expecting 
me he said 
he said he decided to flee syria because of my own personal 
feelings 
i wanted to live in a democracy where people can express their 
views with freedom he said i am going to open a new chapter 
by coming to israel 
asked for his views on syrias politics he repeated his desire 
for freedom and added that by implication you can presume my 
thoughts about the political system in syria 
adel also was asked if he wanted to stay in israel 
i said i wanted to live in a democracy so you might 
conclude i want to live here he replied but he added he was 
uncertain what his plans were 
the pilot said his treatment by israelis has been gentle he 
said he was questioned mainly about his reason for defecting and 
not yet about syrias air force 
adel said little about his mig23 and refused to compare it with 
other syrian aircraft 
he refused to answer questions about his family saying only he 
was born in aleppo northern syria and graduated from syrias air 
academy it has been reported he is a bachelor and a sunni moslem

mayor emory folmar said friday he will 
abide by a judges order to stop praying at high school football 
games at a cityowned stadium but he promised to fight the 
prohibition in court 
us district judge joel dubina on thursday imposed a 10day 
restraining order against folmar and other city officials until a 
hearing in a lawsuit filed by a civil liberties group 
on aug 24 folmar defied an 11th us circuit court of appeals 
ruling that public prayers before high school football games are 
unconstitutional 
folmar and montgomery county commission chairman wf joseph jr 
stood on the 50yard line at the citys cramton bowl and prayed 
aloud prior to the prep seasons first game as protesters blared 
air horns and waved signs against the prayer 
the mayor however said he will not violate dubinas order 
which came on a lawsuit filed by the civil liberties union of 
alabama against folmar joseph the city and the montgomery county 
board of education joseph also is covered by the order 
but folmar said he believes the federal appeals court ruling in 
january which affected georgia alabama and florida does not 
apply when events are held on city property 
this temporary restraining order does apply to me and as a 
constitutional officer i will not pray until i can get a new court 
order in place folmar said he said private funds not city or 
education funds would be used to battle the lawsuit 
in may the us supreme court let stand the appeals court 
decision the high court restricted pregame prayers where the 
promotion of religion at a schoolsanctioned event violates the 
constitutional separation of church and state 
olivia turner executive director of the civil liberties union 
said the august invocation by folmar and joseph clearly violated 
the appeals court ruling 
dubina will schedule a hearing on the civil liberties groups 
request for a permanent order against such prayers within 10 days

resources for the nicaraguan resistance to return to their 
country francisc vendrell told a news conference after a visit 
to the camps of the guerrillas known as contras

enrique bermudez the contras military leader said he was

until wednesday the 1yearlong effort to move 
minority families into south bostons tough predominantly white 
housing projects seemed to be on the right track just last week 
city officials reached a housing settlement with the naacp 
but when nine shots were fired at a black familys apartment in 
one of the projects the optimism surrounding federally mandated 
housing desegration in boston evaporated 
police cars converged on the old colony housing project and 
officers guarded the apartment of mary bullock 39 and her family 
for many residents the incident brought back memories of the 
violence that resulted from courtordered busing in the 1970s for 
city officials it was an alarming setback 
in a news conference outside the bullock apartment friday mayor 
raymond flynn said everything was being done to find those 
responsible for this senseless shooting flynn a lifelong 
south boston resident said those responsible will pay a heavy

gold prospector alferd packer was guilty of 
murder and ate his victims too an expert concluded in a friday 
the 13th report on the most celebrated instance of cannibalism in 
american history 
packer was as guilty as sin and his sins were all mortal 
ones said james e starrs a professor of law and forensic 
science who led a summer expedition of archeology anthropology 
pathology and firearms experts to lake city colo to uproot the 
scarred remains of packers five fellow prospectors 
they studied the bones for 30 days 
his purpose starrs said at a news conference was to show how 
much can be learned through forensic science a field he says is 
underutilized in criminal investigations 
but he also did it he said because i am an iconoclast and 
this was a great icon to clast 
over the years packer became an icon of folk history 
at an annual feast of bad taste at the university of colorado in 
boulder he is toasted his bust has been displayed in the state 
capitol in 1901 a lively newspaper campaign led authorities to 
parole him 15 years after he was sentenced to 40 years in prison 
spreading the packer legend has been a remark attributed to 
judge melville gerry upon sentencing packer 
they was sivin dimmicrats in hinsdale county and ye eat five 
of them god damn ye 
starrs said his scientific sleuthing established that gerry 
never said it that the quotation was made up by a bartender 
packer a union army veteran was convicted of murder in 1883 
and of five charges of manslaughter three years later when the 
first conviction was overturned on a technicality 
he was accused of killing his fellow prospectors in 1874 and 
then staying alive by eating their flesh while stranded in the snow 
during a murderous winter in the colorado rockies 
his story was that one of the gold seekers hungercrazed 
shannon wilson bell came at him with a hatchet when he returned 
empty handed from a fiveday sortie in search of wildlife 
he said bell had killed and cannibalized the others he said he 
shot bell in selfdefense finished him off with the hatchet and 
then survived the winter on his companions flesh 
but the bones showed contradictory evidence starrs said 
it is plain as a pikestaff that packer was the one who was on 
the attack not bell starrs said 
wounds on the bones of three of the victims were caused by a 
hatchetlike instrument at a time when these persons were defending 
themselves from the attack of an aggressor he said 
he said the marks suggested the victims had raised their arms to 
fend off blows 
starrs said the evidence that packers story is false and thus 
that packer is guilty is that the angle of the blade marks on the 
bones from which the flesh had been taken including the bones 
believed to be bells indicated that the cuts were all made by 
the same person 
however starrs acknowledged that his findings had their limits 
he said for example he could not be sure which set of bones was 
bells 
anthropologist walter h birkby of the arizona state museum who 
scrutinized the bones for 26 days said he couldnt share starrs 
conclusions 
it could possibly be the right scenario but scientifically we 
cannot substantiate it birkby said 
last summer birkby went further saying his study of the 
remains actually supported packers story 
starrs however entertained no doubts 
packer he said was having his flesh filets morning noon and 
night even though he could have lived by killing rabbits he said 
the fresh evidence convicts him beyond any shadow of a doubt 
starrs said packer was a fiend base brutish 
barbaric 
the experts also tried to settle forever the fiendish question 
of how packer spelled his first name 
alferd said duane j dillon a criminal investigator 
from martinez calif 
his evidence was elementary on court records military records 
and parole papers the name appears conventionally alfred but 
whenever packer signed a document he used the spelling alferd

a man once charged with strangling 
his wife lost temporary custody of his two young daughters friday 
when a judge ruled him an unfit father 
circuit judge brandt chase downey iii said jeffrey crouch 
refuses to deal with a drug and alcohol problem and cited the 
lingering thoughts that would remain in his daughters minds 
over whether crouch really killed their mother 
crouch left a courtroom in tears denying he killed his wife and 
vowing to appeal the custody decision 
somebody took my wife and now they took my daughters away i 
will appeal and i will get my daughters back he said why 
should i live the rest of my life without my daughters 
crouch 33 spent 17 months in jail on a firstdegree murder 
charge in the january 1987 strangulation of his wife jean helen 
crouch her body was found on a remote beach after a night out with 
her husband 
the murder charge was dismissed in june 1988 by a judge who 
ruled police detectives had coerced a taped confession from crouch 
and the confession could not be used as evidence against him 
no one else has been arrested in the case crouch claims he last 
saw his wife alive the night of jan 27 1987 when the two left 
their daughters with a baby sitter and went to a nightclub he said 
she disappeared when he went to get her coat 
temporary custody of jessica lee crouch 4 and juline anna 
crouch 7 was awarded to their mothers sister judith riha of 
plymouth mass she was appointed their guardian shortly after the 
1987 strangulation 
the question of permanent custody of the children is to be 
decided later 
it is the opinion of this court that crouchs drug and alcohol 
abuse his inability to be truthful his denial of any problems in 
the parenting area and in the drug abuse area and thus his lack of 
addressing these problems through counseling are clear and 
convincing proof that he is an unfit parent at this time said 
circuit judge brandt chase downey iii 
the stigma of a confession and the lingering thoughts that 
crouch might have killed helen would be everpresent in the girls 
mind and thus prohibit them from ever trusting him or even getting 
close to him downey said 
crouch began a legal battle for his daughters after his release 
from jail 
downey prohibited unsupervised visits between crouch and the 
girls in florida but allowed supervised visits in massachusetts 
crouch and the judge said the older girl expressed mixed 
feelings of wanting to return to her father but not wanting to 
leave her aunt 
she was very much pulled and torn kind of like i was 
downey said

under former president alfredo stroessners regime 
and there is a window of hope for improved freedom of 
expression in nicaragua after next years elections said ulibarri 
the iapa noted that new argentine president carlos menem has 
begun privatizing state television stations and making other moves 
to advance press freedom 
in mexico president carlos salinas de gortari chose his address 
to the iapa meeting to announce the government would privatize the 
state newsprint monopoly the company has been used in the past to 
harass independent newspapers by not providing them with newsprint 
the salinas administration also this year has arrested a former 
federal security police director and accused him in the slaying 
five years ago of a wellknown mexico city journalist 
government press restrictions have worsened in some countries 
including cuba nicaragua and hait said ulibarri 
in cuba public enemy no 1 of press freedoms in the 
hemisphere repression of journalists is worse than ever the 
iapa said in a statement 
in colombia peru guatemala and el salvador the press is 
caught in the crossfire between the government and either drug 
cartels or rebels ulibarri said in guatemala the government of 
president vinicio cerezo wants to protect the press but the 
structures of terrorism instituted by former military governments 
are deeply rooted ulibarri said

a federal appeals court ruled friday that 
richard w miller is not a flight risk and ordered a judge to set 
bail for the former fbi agent whose 1986 espionage conviction was 
overturned this year 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals reversed a detention order 
issued by us district judge david kenyon after millers 
conviction was overturned miller has been in federal custody since 
his 1984 arrest 
miller in a federal prison in minnesota reacted with very 
guarded optimism because of past disappointments in the case 
defense attorney joel levine said in los angeles hes very 
anxious to get out levine said 
levine expects miller to be transferred back to california for a 
bail hearing soon now that the case has been returned to federal 
court in los angeles 
the appeals court said the government has failed to prove miller 
is a risk to flee the order returns the case to kenyon to impose 
appropriate release conditions 
miller is the only fbi agent convicted of espionage the 20year 
fbi veteran was convicted of delivering secret us documents to 
his lover svetlana ogorodnikov a russian emigre who pleaded 
guilty with her husband nikolay to espionage 
the ogorodnikovs are serving federal prison terms 
a jury deadlocked in millers first trial but a second jury 
found him guilty and kenyon sentenced him to two life prison terms 
plus 50 years 
the appeals court overturned the conviction in april on grounds 
that kenyon erred in admitting lie detector evidence in the second 
trial in 198586 
the court ordered a new trial for miller and the government 
appealed in july lawyers for miller sought to have him freed on 
bail pending the appeal but kenyon ruled he was a flight risk and 
denied bail 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals turned down the government 
appeal in august and prosecutors have not indicated whether they 
will appeal to the us supreme court or try miller again 
during millers two trials the prosecution depicted him as a 
bitter man who was reprimanded for ineptitude they said he was 
easily recruited in the summer of 1984 by mrs ogorodnikov and her 
husband 
miller went into an fbi office on sept 27 1984 and revealed 
his relationship with mrs ogorodnikov he claimed he was trying to 
redeem his career by infiltrating the kgb 
prosecutors charged that miller and mrs ogorodnikov planned to 
travel to vienna to meet with soviet intelligence agents 
fbi agents grilled miller for four days as mrs ogorodnikov 
frantically called his lynwood home and fbi offices in los angeles 
and santa ana to try to locate him miller arrested oct 2 1984

young amp rubicam one of the nations 
largest advertising agencies pleaded innocent friday to charges it 
paid nearly 1 million in bribes to jamaican officials for the 
islands lucrative tourism campaign 
two of the companys executives and a former executive also 
pleaded innocent friday in us district court 
two jamaicans charged with accepting the bribes former minister 
of tourism eric anthony abrahams and arnold foote jr were not in 
court 
arrest warrants were issued for the two but have not been 
served said us attorney stanley twardy jr the us government 
will begin extradition proceedings against them because they 
havent surrendered voluntarily he said 
jamaicas attorney general carl rattray told the greenwich 
time newspaper in a telephone interview friday that he saw no 
barriers to extraditing abrahams and foote 
usually we cooperate as much as possible rattray said i 
dont think there would be a problem 
abrahams lawyer abe dabdoub has denied that abrahams received 
kickbacks for awarding the tourism boards account to young amp 
rubicam 
the case was poorly investigated with malice in mind 
dabdoub said abrahams held the post from 198184 he is now a 
tourism consultant for several caribbean countries including haiti 
foote now president of the advertising agencies association of 
jamaica says he was never a government official or adviser and 
denies that illegal payments were made 
young amp rubicam faces up to 75 million in fines if it is 
convicted young amp rubicam still holds the jamaica account which 
won praise for its theme come back to jamaica and has 
vigorously denied any wrongdoing 
we will be pressing for an early trial date so we can present 
our evidence and get this matter resolved said young amp rubicam 
in a statement we expect to be found innocent 
the new yorkbased agency along with executive vice president 
arthur r klein and former vice president thomas spangenberg were 
indicted last week on charges of racketeering and conspiracy to 
violate the foreign corrupt practices act steven m mckenna a 
company senior vice president was charged with perjury 
the jamaicans were both charged with racketeering 
the case is believed to the first attempt to use the 
racketeering influence corrupt organizations act against an 
advertising agency 
the indictment alleged that young amp rubicam paid 900000 in 
bribes to foote and abrahams over 5 years starting in 1981 in 
return the indictment alleged young amp rubicam got the jamaican 
tourist boards ad account which prosecutors say generated 375 
million in commissions for the agency 
the government alleged that the payments were funneled to 
abrahams through a sham advertising agency set up by foote that had 
secret bank accounts in the cayman islands 
the indictment said foote should be considered a public official 
because he acted in an official capacity on behalf of abrahams 
as an advisor to the jamaican government on tourism matters 
including the selection of an advertising agency for the jamaica 
tourist board 
young amp rubicam which called the charges without substance or 
merit acknowledges it made payments to ad ventures a company 
controlled by foote the agency says ad ventures provided various 
services for the jamaican account and maintains it had no reason 
to believe that foote could be considered a public official under 
the foreign corrupt practices act 
young and rubicam made very simple conventional legitimate 
business arrangements in jamaica there is absolutely nothing wrong 
with it thomas d barr the agencys lawyer said after the 
arraignments friday 
the governments entire case built during a threeyear 
investigation depends on its characterization of foote as a public 
official which the company will challenge he said 
the jamaica investigation stemmed from an unrelated probe of 
illegal tax shelters bestselling novelist robin moore author of 
the french connection and the green berets pleaded guilty 
here to tax charges in the tax probe and cooperated with federal 
investigators when they turned their attention to the jamaica 
dealings 
moore whose business dealings in jamaica date back 40 years is 
described in the indictment as a middleman who helped steer the 
jamaica account to young amp rubicam and then helped pass money 
between the agency and foote 
twardy said moore profited from the dealings but will not be 
charged 
us magistrate f owen egan set bond at 10000 for the three 
executives and told them they must notify the court before 
traveling outside the united states the case has been assigned to 
us district judge peter c dorsey

the palestine liberation organization 
opposes a reported us plan to bring about israelipalestinian 
talks as the first step toward a peace settlement a senior plo 
official said friday 
yasser abdrabbo a member of the plos 15man executive 
committee said hes against talks that dont include the plo 
this plan is not acceptable to us at all because it is the plo 
that appoints its own representatives to any negotiations he 
told egypts state middle east news agency 
us and israeli proposals have only one aim and that is to 
waste time abdrabbo said after arriving in cairo for meetings 
with egyptian officials 
israel radio said the plan proposed by secretary of state james 
a baker iii would have egypt consult with the palestinians on the 
composition of their delegation and would have israel agree to the 
dialogue only if it is satisfied with the choice of the palestinian 
negotiators 
the israeli plan abdrabbo referred to was in may by israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir for palestinian elections in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza sector who would negotiate with 
israel on interim autonomy talks on the final status of the 
territories would be held later 
abdrabbo is the chief plo delegate to plo talks with the united 
states in tunis capital of tunisia the talks began in december 
after plo chairman yasser arafat publicly renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels existence four rounds have been held so far 
bakers fivepoint plan has not been officially disclosed but 
officials in washington and jerusalem said it sought to reconcile 
israeli and egyptian views on a proposed israelipalestinian 
dialogue baker suggested he and the foreign ministers of egypt and 
israel meet in washington in two weeks for talks 
baker advanced his plan after israels decisionmaking inner 
cabinet rejected last friday an egyptian proposal for an 
israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo israel objected mainly to

president jose azcona hoyo said 
friday that he may declare a state of emergency to prevent a 
walkout at a usbased banana and real estate company from 
becoming a nationwide strike 
we will act with responsibility we could declare a state of 
emergency in the country because the interests of honduras are 
first azcona said 
about 11000 workers at castle amp cooke have been on strike since 
oct 3 
the workers confederation and the national farmworkers 
organization which together have 500000 members said friday they 
will join the strike monday 
i wont stand for any type of threats the problem was not 
created by the government azcona said at a news conference 
honduras would not put up with a general strike for even a week 
because of this we could declare a national state of emergency or 
assume other positions 
castle amp cooke based in san francisco has operated in honduras 
since the turn of the century and sells about 60 percent of the 
nations banana exports honduras exports 50 million 100pound 
boxes annually 
the company among other things also has extensive land 
holdings in southern california and hawaii 
the labor dispute began sept 18 when castle amp cooke sold one of 
its plants to independent packers and transferred the workers 
without giving them salary increases the union rejected the 
action saying honduran law stipulates that pay raises accompany 
transfers 
azcona on monday ordered the workers back on the job and the 
company not to take punitive measures 
the strike continued however and negotiations friday at the 
presidential palace were unsuccessful 
castle amp cooke is losing 250000 daily during the strike 
according to the government

the minister of government and 
justice in the cabinet controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega 
resigned without explanation friday as the regime prepared to purge 
disloyal public employees 
meanwhile the opposition said it was willing to talk about new 
elections if noriega steps down as chief of the defense forces a 
condition the government rejected in unsuccessful negotiations in 
august 
justice ministry spokesman luis romero villalobos said an 
official explanation for the resignation of minister olmedo miranda 
would be given later 
miranda was appointed sept 3 two days after provisional 
president francisco rodriguez took office the provisional 
government was created when noriega annulled the may 7 elections 
which independent observers said the opposition won by a landslide 
the public payroll includes nearly 140000 people and onethird 
may be fired in the next few weeks earlier this week the 
government announced tough measures that among other things make 
it easy for the government to dismiss employees considered disloyal 
official reports said many public employees celebrated on oct 3 
when rebels tried to overthrow noriega who commands the panamanian 
defense forces and runs the country 
every public employee must watch out for traitors that are 
infiltrated noriega told supporters two days after the botched 
coup we are going to make a list 
new laws also have frozen pay suspended christmas bonuses and 
forbidden political activity by professional and business 
associations the government said the intent was preserving 
national sovereignty and defending the economy in the face of 
aggression by the united states 
the united states has tried to oust noriega since he was 
indicted in florida in february 1988 on federal charges of drug 
trafficking and money laundering he denies the charges 
opposition leader guillermo endara said friday that the 
opposition would be willing to hold talks on many grounds about 
new elections 
if gen noriega is willing to leave we would be willing to 
consider what kind of elections could be held said endara 
he was the opposition presidential candidate in the may 
elections and international observers said he beat the government 
candidate by a 31 margin

the bush administration said friday it 
continues to believe there is no fundamental right to abortion but 
told the supreme court state restrictions on abortions for minors 
may be upheld on narrower grounds 
the justice department submitted a friendofthecourt legal 
brief in defense of a minnesota law requiring some girls to tell 
both parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion 
the administration may be taking a somewhat more moderate 
position than the reagan administration did when it urged the 
justices to overturn their 1973 roe vs wade ruling which 
legalized abortions nationwide 
but womens rights activists promptly denounced bush and 
attorney general dick thornburgh 
this is another lastminute attack on womens lives from the 
bush administration said eleanor smeal president of the fund 
for the feminist majority obviously the president and the 
attorney general are ignoring the massive public outcry to keep 
abortion legal congress has received the message recently but 
wheres george 
the national right to life committee on the other hand said 
the brief was excellent 
the justice department said we continue to believe that roe 
was wrongly decided and should be overruled there is in view of 
the nations history and traditions no fundmamental right to 
abortion 
but solicitor general kenneth w starr and other department 
lawyers said minnesotas parental notification regulations 
withstand attack on narrower grounds 
there is utterly no support for the proposition that a minor 
has a fundamental right to keep her parents in the dark about her 
welfare the departments brief said 
a state may reasonably conclude that a minors parents are as 
a general matter better suited to make these critical decisions 
than a minor and her physician or a minor and her physician in 
conjunction with a judge the department said 
the brief also attacked a crucial underpinning of justice sandra 
day oconnors analysis of abortion regulations 
oconnor the high courts pivotal member on abortion has 
stopped short of voting to overturn roe vs wade instead she has 
often endorsed state abortion restrictions on grounds they do not 
pose an undue burden to the fundamental right created by the 
1973 ruling 
the justice department brief said the undue burden analysis 
begs the question at issue whether there is a fundamental right at 
stake that requires courts to view with heightened skepticism any 
regulation limiting access to abortions 
we do not believe upon full reflection that the undue burden 
inquiry can legitimately substitute for a standard of review the 
department lawyers said the analysis cannot assist in 
distinguishing between fundamental rights and other liberty 
interests 
oconnor cast the deciding vote july 3 when the high court 
upheld missouri regulations limiting access to abortion that 54 
ruling permitted the roe vs wade decision to stand but gave states 
new power to limit a womans right to have an abortion 
the justices have three cases including the one from minnesota 
on their docket this term 
they are reviewing an ohio law similar to the minnesota 
statute that requires doctors to notify one parent of unmarried 
minor girls before performing abortions 
the third case from illinois will test whether states can 
impose strict new licensing requirements on abortion clinics that 
could force them to become what one judge said was the functional 
equivalent of small hospitals 
the court will hear arguments in the three cases in november and 
december and is expected to decide them by july

for the first time in 4750 days im thinking beyond today

a lifeguard who pleaded guilty to raping 
an 11yearold girl at a ymca is free after serving only one day of 
a threeday sentence 
derrick anthony parker pleaded guilty in august to seconddegree 
rape which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison he had 
been accused of raping the girl in an equipment room at the 
bethesda ymca 
im appalled gloria goldfaden executive director of the 
maryland chapter of the national committee against child abuse 
said after parkers release this is not justice 
state sentencing guidelines for parker who had no previous 
record were four to nine years in a presentencing report a 
probation officer recommended 18 months in jail 
but montgomery county circuit court judge william cave on oct 6 
sentenced parker 21 to five years in prison with all but three 
days suspended cave also placed parker on three years supervised 
probation ordered him to perform 1000 hours of community service 
and told him to have no unsupervised contact with young girls 
parker a washington resident was released from the county jail 
after spending only one day in jail inmates typically serve 
onethird of their sentence 
cave said it was it one of the most difficult sentences he ever 
had to hand down but he said giving parker a long prison term 
wouldnt benefit him and may conceivably have a disastrous 
effect 
incarceration will not restore that which was taken from 
her he said incarceration will not in my opinion deter other 
people from committing rape because they do not think of that at 
the time 
before announcing the sentence cave said im not unmindful 
that this sounds like a lack of concern or consideration on behalf 
of the victim i certainly dont mean it to be that way 
parkers attorney assistant public defender lois coon said at 
the sentencing that parker had expressed true remorse for what 
happened 
assistant states attorney michelle taylor asked cave to 
sentence parker within the state guidelines four to nine years 
she said the victim a sixthgrader who told police she had a crush 
on parker was not expecting to have sex when she went into the 
room with him in october 1988 
before she knew it it was happening taylor argued 
parker was arrested in january after authorities at the girls 
school learned about the incident and called the police

other books have detailed extramarital affairs 
involving the rev martin luther king jr but the rev ralph david 
abernathys autobiography was written from the inside 
unlike the other books authors abernathy is neither a 
historian nor a journalist but a former confidante of king and 
the books publication has opened a rift in what was kings inner 
circle more than two decades ago 
the other people in the movement have not written such books 
at all none of us have described whats alleged here former 
king aide john lewis said friday 
in and the walls came tumbling down abernathy said king 
had a weakness for women he wrote that king spent part of the 
last night of his life in memphis tenn with two women then 
fought with a third whod been looking for him 
civil rights leaders including king aides andrew young jesse 
jackson and lewis denounced the book thursday calling on 
abernathy to repudiate it and expressing doubt hed written the 
memphis section 
on friday about two dozen people including alabama black 
leaders gathered at kings first church in montgomery ala to 
call for a boycott of the book 
martin luther king is like christ youve got your judases 
joe reed head of the alabama democratic partys black caucus said 
at dexter avenue king memorial baptist church 
other king historians including pulitzer prizewinners taylor 
branch and david garrow have written king had a predilection for 
women 
in parting the waters america in the king years branch 
wrote how kings inner circle including abernathy young and 
others was defined by an adjustment each made to kings private 
life 
these were people who tolerated or even applauded kings demon 
delights as a humanizing revelation that bonded them even closer to 
him and his public purpose branch wrote they objected to 
kings mistresses no more than to the scores of concubines who had 
soothed king david 
garrow also dealt with the subject in bearing the cross 
martin luther king jr and the southern christian leadership 
conference 
they were not participants said lewis now a democratic 
congressman from atlanta but this is not only a participant but 
a close friend a leader within the movement 
the rev otis moss jr pastor of clevelands olivet 
institutional baptist church and a friend of abernathy told him in 
a letter that he should have higher standards than others whove 
written about king 
moss said that while garrow and others may focus on kings sex 
life you and i must forever focus on his spiritual genius 
the letter was released friday by jesse hill an insurance 
executive who is chairman of the board of the king center in 
atlanta and who spoke for young jackson lewis and others in 
denouncing the book thursday 
lewis said he was hurt that someone so close to dr king and 
so critical to our struggle for civil rights would attempt to 
discredit dr king and our movement in this way 
lewis also said he objects to the specific stories 
abernathys womanbywoman account of kings last night taylor 
branch doesnt go into the gory detail he said 
im for not distorting the truth lewis said whether this 
is true or not true shouldnt take anything away from the 
leadership the man provided this nation 
a prominent black alabama attorney jl chestnut complained 
thursday that abernathy should not be throwing stones about other 
people in light of reports about his own past 
according to branchs book a flamboyant montgomery ala man 
armed with a hatchet once chased abernathy and complained the 
minister had been sleeping with his wife since she was 15 
abernathy refused to sign a complaint against the man 
some years later branch wrote king confided to a 
colleague that he not only had known of abernathys extramarital 
liaisons in montgomery but had joined in some of them himself 
abernathy has not returned repeated calls from the associated 
press seeking elaboration on his book and comment on reaction to 
it representatives of harper amp row the books publisher have 
said the words are his own 
abernathy spoke with reporters in memphis on thursday where he 
was promoting the book he told them he was no betrayer of king and 
that he resents accusations that strokes and brain surgery have 
left his mind impaired 
im not judas he said i know who i am im a christian 
minister i am most surprised anybody would think im mentally 
incompetent

two white police officers were indicted friday on 
battery and other charges for allegedly hitting two black 
teenagers then forcing them out of a squad car in a white 
neighborhood where they were beaten by residents the august 
incident and another in which a black man was shot to death by 
police sparked allegations of police racism and prompted city 
council hearings on police brutality 
but cook countys chief prosecutor on friday cautioned against 
concluding the officers were racist 
why must it be put in a racial context states attorney 
cecil partee said at a news conference announcing the indictments 
thats part of the problem in chicago today everything is being 
put in a racial context 
the officers kathleen moore 31 and james serio 35 were 
each charged with two counts of official misconduct a felony and 
one count of misdemeanor battery they will be suspended without 
pay said police spokesman patrick camden 
serio and moore allegedly picked the 14yearold boys up for a 
curfew violation outside of comiskey park shortly after an aug 15 
white sox game 
the standard procedure in curfew violations is to take the 
offender home but according to prosecutors the officers instead 
drove the boys to a white neighborhood not far from the ballpark 
moore hit the boys before forcing them out of the patrol car 
prosecutors said 
the boys were then beaten by a group of residents who were later 
charged with aggravated battery and ethnic intimidation said 
states attorney spokesman dan mccullough 
each misconduct charge carries a maximum penalty of five years 
in prison and a 10000 fine the battery count is punishable by up 
to a year in jail and a 1000 fine 
although moore is the officer accused of hitting the boys serio 
also faces the charge because he could have intervened and did 
not said mccullough 
arraignment was set for nov 9 the officers will not be 
arrested before then because they are not considered at risk to 
leave the jurisdiction he said 
in the second case of alleged brutality 24yearold leonard 
bannister was shot to death on a south side street by a police 
officer 
police maintain that bannister was shot while trying to grab the 
officers gun but other witnesses have said that was not the case 
the mans family has filed a 5 million civil rights lawsuit 
against the officer

jenifer graham who refused to dissect a frog 
in her high school biology class because it violated her beliefs 
is the subject of a television dramatization aimed at her fellow 
students 
frog girl the jenifer graham story will be broadcast 
tuesday afternoon in the cbs schoolbreak special a onehour 
show that details miss grahams refusal to compromise her belief 
that all life is sacred 
the show starring ellen dunning as jenifer and kerrie keane as 
her mother patricia has a script by harry and renee longstreet 
that keeps its focus on the story and avoids the issueoftheweek 
feel that many such shows carry 
the show was directed by harry longstreet and camerawork was by 
don fauntleroy whose wife actress lesleyanne down was so taken 
by a reading of the script that she volunteered for a bit part 
i respect other peoples beliefs i just want mine respected 
too said miss graham in a recent interview she is now 18 and a 
freshman at california state university san bernardino with an 
undeclared major 
in the spring of 1987 her biology teacher and principal at 
victor valley high school and its governing board refused a 
request from miss graham and her attorneys to perform some 
alternate work instead of dissecting a frog that had been raised 
and killed specifically for lab science 
i was trying to make it obvious that i would do just as much 
work if not more she said i felt like i was talking to a 
wall i was compared to a kid who didnt want to sit next to a 
black person in typing class and someone who didnt want to run in 
pe 
all of that just one month after starting school as a transfer 
student from nebraska where she and her mother reached a 
compromise with teachers when she refused a lab dissection in 7th 
grade 
there was initially no room for compromise at victor valley high 
school located in the high desert community of victorville 70 
miles northeast of los angeles 
miss graham said she suffered depression and her grades dropped 
while she received international attention in the spring of 1987 as 
the frog girl a term she loathes 
different schools act differently said miss graham but 
look at the good it the controversy did it passed a bill for the 
whole state of california she was referring to the students 
rights bill which permits students morally opposed to dissection 
to refrain from it in return for equivalent work 
but the bill took effect jan 1 of this year too late to help 
miss graham who was stuck with a c on her transcript for the 
biology class down from an a 
a lawsuit was dismissed in august of 1988 when a federal judge 
accepted the high schools offer of substituting photographs of a 
frog which had died a natural death 
but miss graham objected saying she was dissatisfied with how 
the school would guarantee the frog was not killed an appeal 
continues 
although she said she never lost a single friend over the 
controversy she is happy to resume anonymity as a college student 
no one even recognizes me and i dont mind a bit to tell you 
the truth 
since her exposure to the power of media she said she has 
gained an interest in marketing and advertising 
there are not many people who have the courage to do as she 
did and stand by her convictions said miss down who briefly 
appears in the show as a witness before a legislative committee 
considering the students rights bill 
its hard enough to do when you are a grownup but when you 
are a kid that makes you something pretty special miss down 
said the lesson this teaches young people is invaluable

inside a north london rehearsal hall lurk the 
tempestuous passions of a new york tenement 
deres been a moider one actor cries in his best noo yawk 
mimicry while another gets advice on the correct way to say 
shirt torn its not very articulate its like shirddorn 
says dialogue coach charmian hoare the moment is the tragic 
secondact climax of kurt weills 1947 street scene the german 
composers look at sultry summertime life in the big apple slums 
the show which has had a checkered history is readying its 
professional london debut with an angloamerican creative team 
this is totally unique ive never done anything like it 
said american soprano kristine ciesinksi she sings the role of the 
doomed anna maurrant the wife whose adultery leads to her 
moider or murder 
internationally known english bass richard van allan sings the 
part of her vengeful husband frank and janis kelly a scot is 
their daughter rose 
both ciesinski and kelly appeared in the productions british 
premiere at the scottish opera in glasgow last may that was the 
first professional british production of a work whose exposure here 
has been limited to school stagings and a onenight charity benefit 
now restaged and somewhat recast after glasgow street 
scene joins londons english national opera repertory for an oct 
17 opening briton david pountney the enos director of 
productions again directs american conductor carl davis is new to 
the venture in london 
weill became famous for his collaboration with the playwright 
bertolt brecht on such works as the threepenny opera with his 
wife the singer lotte lenya he emigrated to the united states in 
1935 he died in 1950 
street scene reunites conductor davis with a show he first 
saw in its broadway premiere when he was 11 he went on to be a 
repetiteur coach on its 1959 revival at the new york city opera 
where the show is once again in the repertory this autumn 
in a way this is a funny full circle davis said of his 
current assignment he said peter jonas enos artistic director 
telephoned and suggested the idea i said this is madness but 
id love to for nostalgia 
street scene has traditionally confounded purists with its 
blend of operatic bravura and populist broadway savvy 
the show has a knockout dance number moonfaced 
starryeyed right out of broadways golden age but its choral 
passages and arias recall the lyricism of another hybrid george 
gershwins 1935 porgy and bess 
and despite its lowlife setting street scene has more 
sentiment than did weills earlier hardedged collaborations with 
brecht mahagonny which was recently restaged in los angeles 
and the threepenny opera due on broadway in november starring 
pop singer sting 
audiences initially found street scene perplexing 
it was very unconventional explained davis who has a 
separate career composing and conducting music for film classics 
such as abel gances napoleon and charlie chaplins city 
lights 
at the same time it had elements that made it attractive for 
an opera company long developed passages for legitimate opera 
voices for which all of the formulas of broadway musicals are swept 
aside 
street scene is only the second eno production of a work 
that originated on broadway it will play in repertory with such 
operatic warhorses as verdis a masked ball and puccinis 
madam butterfly 
is it opera or musical pountney says it doesnt matter 
opera has been so many different things in its life from what 
monteverdi wrote to what mozart wrote to what wagner wrote said 
the cambridgeeducated director 
to me anything which combines theater and music might as well 
be called opera as anything else 
ciesinski said the show combined humor tragedy broadway 
dancing blues jazz operatic singing all of them built up so it 
flows along very naturally ciesinksi who is married to british 
baritone norman bailey is making her london debut with street 
scene she returns to eno next year to sing two heavyweight 
roles strausss salome and verdis lady macbeth 
thats more my normal meat and potatoes so this is sort of 
unusual to create something very natural and moving not a crazy 
bitchy lady she said 
and although she also sings salome in baltimore in december she 
is pleased to be based in europe being an opera singer is more 
of a way of life here in america i cant even get a credit card

sampls themselves federal deposit insurance has protected most 
depositors from the widespread debacles and in some cases 
outright fraud 
this one lincoln was more heartless than the rest others 
just robbed the entire public at large said ronald rus an 
attorney representing some of the 22000 including a blind woman 
who took a bus to the bank and was sold the bonds 
the investors say they thought they were putting their money in 
safe certificates of deposit at lincoln savings a 29branch thrift 
where deposits were insured by the federal government 
instead of insured cds what they really bought were 
highyielding subordinated debentures junk bonds in 
lincolns parent company american continental corp a 
phoenixbased real estate developer run by charles keating jr 
in april american continental filed for bankruptcy protection 
and suspended interest payments on the bonds now in default 
federal regulators then took control of lincoln which they say may 
prove to be the biggest sampl failure ever costing the government 
25 billion 
regulators said cd holders were protected by deposit insurance 
bondholders were on their own 
since the bondholders are at the end of the line in bankruptcy 
court experts say their paper is virtually worthless 
keating and other american continental officers declined comment 
for this story because of pending lawsuits over the losses in the 
past keating has denied doing anything wrong he blamed federal 
regulators for what he called harassment 
the house banking committee wants to know more and voted last 
week to subpoena keating along with federal and california state 
thrift regulators to testify at hearings on lincolns problems 
in an interview american continental spokesman brad boland said 
the firms whole goal is to reorganize and pay off the 
bondholders 
back in the heady rapidgrowth days lincoln lobbies were 
filled with signs touting the bonds which paid about 2 percentage 
points above cds and were sold in denominations as little as 1000 
lincoln tellers tried to steer customers to the bonds 
bondholders say sales calls were placed to lincoln depositors 
shortly before large cds were up for renewal 
the bonds werent insured underwritten by a brokerage house or 
even traded on an open market like other junk bonds 
they were supposed to be sold only by american continental 
employees stationed at lincoln branches but some investors say 
lincoln tellers sold them the bonds interest could be deposited 
right into lincoln savings accounts 
they said this is our mother company and its as good as 
lincoln savings and its got billions of dollars in assets said 
achille desio who deposited his 25000 lumpsum pension in the 
bonds 
they never told me it was not insured ive been very prudent 
all my life i dont risk money 
desio said he wasnt given a prospectus which does say the 
bonds were uninsured until weeks after the sale 
but bondholders who did ask specifically if the bonds were 
covered by federal deposit insurance say they never were told 
no 
they said lincoln savings backed the bonds they said the bank 
would have to fail and the bank is insured by the government 
said harold rosenberg a van nuys attorney who invested 100000 
lincoln and american continental shared the same red white and 
blue logo and bondholders said lincoln went out of its way to show 
the savings bank and acc were one and the same american 
continental representatives sometimes went behind the counter to 
help cash checks when lines grew long 
some customers were allowed to transfer cds that had not yet 
matured to the bonds without the penalty for early withdrawal 
some even said lincoln tellers offered to come to their house to 
pick up a check for the bonds 
there was such a commingling of efforts that you didnt know 
where lincoln ended and american continental started said 
rosenberg 
bondholders and attorneys say they believe lincoln targeted the 
elderly 
it was simply a case of a greedy man who thought he could 
defraud and deceive the elderly said leah kane a bondholder who 
has organized a group of 200 at leisure world a giant retirement 
community outside los angeles 
scams come into leisure world and we hear about them all the 
time she said scams dont usually come in through the banks

amr corp remained silent today on a 7 billion 
proposed buyout by new york developer donald trump amid reports the 
parent of american airlines is seeking help from unions and 
billionaire robert m bass 
meanwhile in washington a hearing is scheduled monday before 
the house public works and transportation committee on legislation 
proposed this week that would give the government more authority to 
review airline buyouts 
in early trading today on the new york stock exchange amr was 
up 3625 a share to 102375 still well below the 120 per share 
offered by trump but the second straight day of an increase 
on thursday amr rose 1625 to close at 9875 as 16 million 
shares changed hands on wednesday the price had fallen 425 a 
share 
financial analysts have said the stock will continue to trade 
far below the level of trumps offer until there is a significant 
move by either side 
the new york times reported today that amr chairman robert l 
crandall met with americans pilots union about a possible 
employeemanagement buyout designed to fend off trumps offer the 
buyout would include significant participation by the pilots union 
and the unions representing machinists and flight attendants at 
american the times said 
pilots union officials did not return calls seeking comment the 
other two unions previously have said they have discussed possible 
responses to the trump offer 
the times quoting an unidentified wall street source said the 
amr buyout would be similar to a pending pilotmanagement bid for 
ual corp parent of united airlines 
previous reports have said the pilots at american were asked 
prior to trumps bid to study a possible buyout 
meanwhile the wall street journal reported thursday that aides 
to bass had indicated the secretive investor might be willing to 
help amr fend off trump bass officials refused to comment on the 
report 
amr parent of the nations largest and most profitable airline 
has remained silent on trumps offer since it was revealed oct 5 
saying it will respond in due course the next scheduled 
meeting of the board of directors is oct 18 
trump officials said thursday there is nothing new to 
report on wednesday trump attorney jack nusbaum said there had 
been no contact between the two sides trumps offer is set to 
expire oct 20 
amr while refusing to discuss its own proposed takeover said 
thursday it had asked the department of transportation to make 
fundamental changes in the air service agreement between the 
united states and britain before allowing british airways plc to 
participate in a leveraged buyout of ual 
under the proposed 675 billion buyout british airways would 
end up with 15 percent of chicagobased ual while employees would 
own 75 percent and management 10 percent 
british airways shareholders voted in london today to approve 
the airlines 15 percent stake in ual which would cost it 750 
million 
amr said the ual deal represents a unilateral opening of us 
aviation markets 
amr spokesman al becker said the company believes the us 
government should require britain to ease access to its markets for 
us carriers 
becker said american has been stymied in its efforts to launch 
chicagolondon and new yorkmanchester routes because the british 
government is one of the most restrictive in the world in 
allowing foreign carriers access to its markets

bushels respectively

stocks would total 443 million bushels next may 31 the end of the 
current marketing year compared with 698 million bushels at the 
end of the 198889 marketing year 
if there was a surprise in the report it was probably in the 
wheat said walter spilka grain market analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co in new york those wheat stocks are 
fairly tight

usdas announcement late thursday of a sale of 100000 metric tons

with the contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn

the topperforming fixedincome investments for 
the first nine months of the year were mortgagebacked securities 
salomon brothers inc says but these tricky investments arent for 
everyone 
mortgagebacked securities are bondlike investments derived 
from the monthly payments made on home mortgages 
these securities offer high yields and are considered extremely 
safe but they have disadvantages among them are an uncertain rate 
of repayment of an investors money and an inexact maturity date 
thats because homeowners dont always make mortgage payments at 
a predictable rate especially if the mortgages have an adjustable 
rate pegged to market interest rates 
when interest rates rise homeowners may slow down payments 
when they fall they may speed them up or refinance meaning a 
security tied to their mortgages could be paid off sooner than the 
projected maturity 
you get your money back early when you dont want it early and 
you get it back late when you dont want it back late said 
michael stein a financial planner at the chicago investment 
adviser brownson rehmus amp foxworth 
when a security pays off sooner than expected the investor is 
forced to come up with a new place to put the money that will earn 
a competitive rate of interest that may be impossible when 
interest rates are declining 
mortgagebacked securities were introduced by the government 
national mortgage association or ginnie mae in 1970 ginnie mae 
like its cousins fannie mae and freddie mac buys mortgage 
portfolios from savings and loans which gives the thrifts more 
money to loan out in turn ginnie mae repackages these mortgages 
and sells them to investors 
heres how it works when mrs jones makes a monthly mortgage 
payment to anytown savings and loan the cash is funneled by the 
thrift to ginnie mae this semiautonomous government agency then 
passes along the cash after taking a cut to the buyer of the 
mortgagebacked security 
according to salomon the total return of mortgagebacked 
securities interest payments plus any price appreciation 
outdistanced all other fixedincome investments such as corporate 
and treasury bonds from january to september despite an increase 
in mortgage issues coming to the market 
the main reason the increased supply failed to depress the price 
of these securities was that investment houses are tailoring these 
investments to the needs of particular investors said salomon 
analyst judy otterman 
the ability to move these securities to new buyers was key 
she said 
the chief type of repackaged mortgagebacked security is called 
a collateralized mortgage obligation or cmo 
cmos also are backed by the cash flow from a pool of mortgages 
but unlike traditional mortgagebacked securities the cmo pool is 
much larger and is divided into different payment streams with 
a separate security tied to each of these cash flows from the 
mortgages 
cmos are structured so that they have a fixed coupon like a 
bond meaning they make stable interest payments to the investor 
by contrast interest payments on traditional mortgagebacked 
securities are not as predictable 
cmos also are structured according to various maturities so an 
investor may buy one according to how long he wants to lock up his 
money and where he thinks interest rates are headed all of them 
have maturities shorter than the 30 years of a ginnie mae 
the repayment of a cmo investors principal still is affected by 
the rate of payments made on the underlying mortgages but the 
volatility isnt as great as with traditional mortgagebacked 
securities because the mortgage pool is much larger 
mortgagebacked securities are bought primarily by institutional 
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies but 
increasingly they are attracting individual investors particularly 
for taxsheltered retirement or pension accounts according to the 
investment firm gabriele hueglin amp cashman 
one reason mortgagebacked securities are not more attractive to 
individuals is their cost most are packaged in units of 25000 
although on the secondary market issues that have been around 
awhile and already repaid some of their principal may be bought for 
half that much said brian hays a senior vice president at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
an easier and cheaper way for individual investors to get into 
the mortgagebacked market is through mutual funds that specialize 
in them 
brian mattes a spokesman for mutualfund operator vanguard 
group said vanguards mortgagebacked fund has been a popular 
place to put money from individual retirement accounts but its 
high yield may attract other investors 
vanguards mortgagebacked fund has yielded 930 percent in 
recent days while its treasury bond fund yielded 806 percent 
this additional yield may make up for the potential of a decline in 
an investors holding due to early payments made on the underlying 
mortgages mattes said

pulitzer publishing co friday posted a 26 
percent increase in its profit for the third quarter which the 
media company said reflected costcutting and debt reduction 
efforts

share compared to 313 million or 30 cents a share in 1988s

9441 million for the same period a year ago

broadcasting industries during the third quarter we continued to 
benefit from our debt reduction and costcontrol efforts

503000 in the quarter as compared to the same period a year

wholesale prices shot up 09 percent in 
september fueled by a sharp rise in energy costs the government 
said today 
the climb last month in the labor departments producer price 
index wiped out consecutive price declines of 04 percent in august 
and july and 01 percent in june 
the september reversal brought the annual wholesale inflation 
rate for the first nine months of the year to 51 percent and 
marked a return to the high inflation of the early part of the year 
although wholesale inflation is not nearly as bad as feared 
after prices advanced at a 101 percent annual rate in the first 
quarter it is still significantly higher than the 40 percent rate 
posted in all of 1988 
contributing to the big september jump was a statistical glitch 
in the measurement of auto prices which were skewed because 
manufacturers offered their endofthemodelyear price incentives 
earlier in the summer than usual 
when monthtomonth increases were adjusted for normal seasonal 
variations auto prices rose 38 percent in september when 
seasonal adjustments are factored out auto prices actually 
declined 05 percent 
we were due for a big rebound after several months of 
declines said economist allen sinai of the boston co i 
would not be particularly alarmed about this onemonth spike up 
given the seasonal effect in autos and the spike in energy which 
will probably be a onetime event 
the stock market at first showed little reaction to the news as 
well as to a separate report showing strongerthanexpected retail 
sales last month but by noon the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks fell 1988 points to 273996 traders interpreted 
the reports as a sign the federal reserve would not soon lower 
interest rates 
according to a labor department analyst roughly 08 percentage 
points of the 09 percent monthly rise in the inflation index was 
attributable to motor vehicles and energy 
energy prices which had fallen in june july and august shot 
up 65 percent last month fuel oil rose 163 percent gasoline 
106 percent and natural gas 34 percent 
in good news the department said food prices dropped 06 
percent vegetables were down 161 percent turkeys 49 percent 
pasta 44 percent and beef 40 percent prices for pork fish 
fruit and rice also fell 
excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories 
prices rose 07 percent in september following a 05 percent 
increase in august 
the cost of home furnishings health products magazines floor 
coverings tobacco and alcoholic beverages all rose 
in another economic report today the commerce department said 
retail sales rose 05 percent in september the seventh consecutive 
month without a decline overall sales increased to a seasonally 
adjusted 1452 billion last month following a 07 percent gain in 
august and a revised 07 percent rise in july 
the 09 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index left 
it at 1135 meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 
100 in 1982 would have cost 11350 last month in advance many 
economists were predicting a 07 percent or 08 percent rise 
the return of wholesale inflation in september was likely to 
dampen financial market speculation that the federal reserve board 
would soon lower interest rates 
traders had been hoping the central bank would cut rates to curb 
the rise in the value of the dollar which is hurting us chances 
to improve its trade deficit 
however in a speech at a conference in washington on thursday 
night fed vice chairman manuel h johnson said we have to focus 
our attention in monetary policy on domestic inflationary 
implications 
the inflation news was not particularly encouraging in september 
measures of prices earlier in the production process intermediate 
goods rose 04 percent after three successive drops and crude goods 
jumped 11 percent examples of the three processing stages 
finished intermediate and crude are bread flour and wheat 
the federal reserve in recent months has been walking a 
tightrope hoping to keep interest rates high enough to dampen 
inflationary pressures but low enough to avoid a recession said 
washington economic consultant michael k evans 
the fed fought inflationary pressures through this spring by 
driving shortterm interest rates up then after signs of economic 
softness emerged the central bank eased a bit in june and july 
but it has since held steady as a string of economic reports 
portrayed a resilient economy 
last week in the first broad look at economic activity in 
september the labor department reported manufacturing lost 103000 
jobs the biggest drop in seven years as the unemployment rate 
edged up from 52 percent to 53 percent 
many analysts took the report as a sign of renewed weakness 
possibly giving the fed room to lower interest rates further but 
evans said the fed is still concerned that inflation is too high 
the fed is going to say if there are signs of softness 
thats too bad our first priority is to beat back inflation he

a cold snap that damaged tender orange and 
grapefruit blooms last winter may set back the citrus industrys 
recovery from treekilling freezes in the mid 1980s agriculture 
officials said 
state forecasters thursday estimated florida will harvest 130 
million boxes of oranges and 44 million boxes of grapefruit this 
season it would be the smallest orange crop in three years and the 
smallest grapefruit crop in five years 
the drop is attributed to a threeday dip in temperatures that 
hurt blooms last february but did not damage fruit on the trees 
the good news is that the trees themselves were not damaged by 
the cold said harry whittaker citrus statistician with the 
florida agricultural statistics service in orlando so if we get 
through this winter we should have a good crop next year 
during the season that ended in july florida harvested 1466 
million boxes of oranges and 548 million boxes of grapefruit worth 
an estimated 141 billion a record 144 billion citrus crop was 
harvested the previous season 
the joint state and federal crop reporting service uses a 
combination of surveys and computer models to make the crop 
forecasts 
major freezes in 1983 and 1985 killed about 200000 acres of 
trees most in central florida 
i personally thought it would be a few more boxes but its a 
good estimate on both oranges and grapefruit said bill 
youngblood an orange county citrus grower and processor its 
good for prices particularly on grapefruit 
although smaller crops generally increase prices a record 
orange crop in brazil estimated at 300 million boxes could keep 
domestic juice prices down officials said more than 90 percent of 
floridas orange crop is converted to juice 
john jackson citrus specialist with the lake county 
agricultural extension service said the orange forecast was at 
least 20 million boxes smaller than he was anticipating 
i wouldnt secondguess them jackson told the orlando 
sentinel based on their track record and their computer models 
theyre generally pretty accurate 
the smaller orange crop means that the state should produce 
about 1498 million gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice 
down from 175 million gallons in 19881989 according to estimates 
by the lakelandbased florida citrus mutual the states largest 
growers organization 
if we escape this season with no serious freezes in the citrus 
belt the 199091 crop should be the best weve had in many 
years said bobby mckown mutuals executive vice president 
the florida department of citrus a state agency that promotes 
the industry with money collected from grower fees also may have 
to cut its 724 million budget as a result of the smaller crop 
said spokeswoman cathy clay 
were a little disappointed in the crop sizes but we have 
every confidence that the industry is still on the road to recovery 
from the earlier freezes ms clay said 
a box of oranges weighs 90 pounds and a box of grapefruit is 85 
pounds

senate leaders today agreed on a plan to strip 
hundreds of specialinterest provisions from a 141 billion 
deficitreduction bill leaving partisan fights over a capital 
gains tax cut and other controversial issues for the future 
republican and democratic leaders were attempting to sell the 
agreement to their respective members which if successful would 
ease the way for completion of the budgetcutting bill later in the 
day 
we think this is absolutely the best approach said sen 
pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the senate 
budget committee 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said the deal would allow the senate to pass a 
strippeddown bill i mean really stripped 
sen robert packwood of oregon ranking republican on the 
finance panel said this ensures we will have another tax bill 
very soon two or three weeks 
he said a capital gains tax cut a democratic plan to expand 
individual retirement accounts and other proposals could be 
attached to that tax measure 
acrosstheboard spending cuts on government programs totaling 
16 billion will take effect monday unless the senate finishes its 
deficitreduction bill the house and senate agree to a compromise 
version and president bush signs it into law 
the house previously passed its own 11 billion deficitcutting 
bill loaded with specialinterest provisions of its own 
with house members out of town until next week it seems 
unlikely that a compromise bill can be completed until then if the 
automatic cuts take effect they can be rolled back by congress 
later 
earlier today bush told reporters that while mixing capital 
gains and iras in this debate is troublesome to me he would let 
republicans on capitol hill find the solution to a dispute that has 
slowed work on a 141 billion deficitreduction bill 
asked if he was ruling out accepting broader iras he said i 
am not ruling out anything in that regard i am ruling in capital 
gains 
the leaders worked out the deal as the senate headed into a 
second day of debate on the budgetcutting measure which has drawn 
criticism from members of both parties for being loaded with 
provisions for special interests that do little to shrink the 
deficit 
republicans with support from some democrats have been 
threatening to offer an amendment reducing the capital gains tax a 
top priority of bush but senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine told reporters thursday without a doubt he would 
prevent the gop from getting the 60 votes it needs 
were going to offer it every chance we have including 
putting it on the deficitreduction bill senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan told reporters 
the budgetcutting legislation aimed at whittling the deficit 
to below 110 billion for the fiscal year that began oct 1 took 
its share of abuse thursday from lawmakers who said it was stocked 
with unnecessary items 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn whose 
panel sent the legislation to the senate floor thursday on a 97 
vote said the 1376page measure would be only 100 pages long if 
extraneous provisions were removed from it 
sen william armstrong rcolo hefted the bill which he said 
weighed 12 pounds 15 ounces 
i dont think theres a single senator who has more or less a 
general idea about what is in this legislation he complained 
sen phil gramm rtexas cited some language he said had little 
to do with reducing the federal budget shortfall strike 
eggplants and substitute eggplants kiwi fruits nectarines and 
plums he read 
the first amendment the senate approved thursday boosted 
hospital spending by 40 million 
the legislation would raise 53 billion in mostly minor new tax 
increases including a doubling of the current 3 tax charged to 
departing international airline passengers and a new tax on 
chemicals that deplete the atmospheres ozone it also makes 
permanent the 3 percent tax on longdistance and local telephone 
service that otherwise would expire next year 
the measure raises 50 million by requiring boat owners to 
purchase decals and 239 million by forcing airlines to pay for 
using airports in new york chicago and washington dc 
it would save 31 billion under medicare by reducing payments 
to hospitals freezing reimbursement rates for doctors and limiting 
increases in other medical costs 
the bill takes credit for nearly 18 billion in savings merely 
by moving the moneylosing postal service offbudget and 420 
million more by postponing some agriculture payments until a later 
fiscal year 
other provisions have little to do with eliminating budgetary 
red ink federal child care efforts are beefed up and a commission 
on child disability is established

stock prices slumped again today as the market 
absorbed the news of a jump in the producer price index 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 2316 points to 
273668 by 2 pm on wall street 
losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide 
trading of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 377 up 
1040 down and 472 unchanged 
the labor department reported that the producer price index of 
finished goods rose 09 percent in september abruptly reversing a 
series of declines through the summer months 
at first the market took the news with little evident concern 
analysts noted that a rise of about that size had been widely 
expected in the financial world 
economists also said they believed that much of the increase 
stemmed from temporary influences that didnt necessarily portend 
more bad news on inflation in the months ahead 
however the figures still were taken as a message that the 
federal reserve wouldnt be very likely to take any steps soon to 
relax its credit policy 
that concern was reinforced by a separate report of an 
unexpectedly strong 05 percent gain in retail sales last month 
aristech chemical climbed 4 to 21 in active trading the 
company said it received a 25ashare takeover proposal from a 
group including investor jon m huntsman

us trade representative carla hills urged japan 
friday to scrap what she called discriminatory anticompetitive 
trade practices and said tokyo must work with washington to 
overcome us frustration with the japanese 
anticompetitive practices whether official or private run 
counter to the world we seek and to the world that brought japan 
its prosperity mrs hills told reporters at the japan national 
press club 
there is a strong feeling of inequality where the american 
market is open but markets overseas are closed where the overseas 
investor buys stocks bonds businesses in america but americans 
cannot do so overseas she said we must work together to bring 
down that feeling of frustration 
mrs hills arrived in tokyo from south korea thursday for a 
fourday visit and met later with construction minister shozo 
harada 
on friday mrs hills told prime minister toshiki kaifu that she 
hopes for a quiet friendly resolution to trade problems 
between the two countries foreign ministry officials said 
she told the japanese leader she hoped japan would implement by 
november measures to liberalize its construction market and 
increase imports of american satellites supercomputers and 
forestry products 
kaifu said he was working hard to get japan to import more us 
products and noted that japanese imports from the united states 
last year rose 10 billion over 1987 ministry officials said 
in her speech mrs hills criticized japan for what she described 
as unfair business practices such as japanese firms alleged habit 
of buying only from japanese suppliers and discrimination against 
foreign investors 
she said she was happy that a joint venture between mcdonalds 
japan and an american toy retailer to set up shop in this country 
was likely to be approved by the japanese government within two 
years but added even two years is a long time compared to no 
wait at all when a foreign investor wishes to open a large store in 
the united states 
the toughtalking exattorney also criticized a practice called 
patent flooding in which certain firms apply for so many 
patents that competitors cannot easily market rival products 
asked about a public opinion poll conducted in the united states 
earlier this month by the gallup organization that showed more 
americans thought japans economic strength was a greater threat to 
the united states than the soviet military mrs hills said i 
dont see japanese economic power as a threat its a wonderful 
accomplishment but i see the destruction of the world trading 
system as a threat

the national broadcasting co has 
expressed an interest in joining qintex australia ltd in a bid for 
the historic mgmua communications co film and tv studio 
but mgmua spokeswoman mary stevens hardy and qintex spokesman 
dan saks declined comment friday on whether mgmua and qintex 
whose 15 billion merger collapsed monday were renegotiating the 
deal 
however a source close to the transaction who asked not to be 
identified said no formal talks had taken place and that if 
contacts had taken place they were extremely tentative 
nbc spokesman joseph rutledge said qintex had approached nbc 
with a proposal to become a participant in their bid for mgmua and 
we were interested 
rutledge wouldnt say how much nbc had been asked to chip in 
nor would he disclose plans to cope with federal rules that 
restrict the major networks role in owning or distributing 
programming to local tv stations 
nbc owns the nbc television network and nbcs chairman and chief 
executive robert c wright has been a vocal opponent of the 
socalled financial interest and syndication rules calling them an 
outmoded restriction on the networks 
qintex first bid for mgmua last spring in a complicated deal 
that would have resulted in it paying about 600 million for some 
assets 
three weeks ago media magnate rupert murdoch stepped in with a 
lastminute 14 billion bid for the entire company but qintex 
topped that by bidding 25 a share or 15 billion 
mgmuas principal shareholder beverly hills billionaire kirk 
kerkorian accepted and the deal was to have become final dec 15 
but the agreement collapsed monday after mgmua charged qintex with 
failing to deliver a 50 million letter of credit a nonrefundable 
down payment 
mgmua has filed suit in federal court in los angeles against 
qintex seeking at least 50 million in damages

a bearish crop report and forecasts for a weekend 
of good harvesting weather triggered a late plunge in soybean 
futures prices to new 23month lows friday on the chicago board of 
trade 
grain futures closed mostly lower following the soybean market 
down as the trading day ended 
the agriculture departments new crop estimates for corn and 
soybeans were higher than expected at 745 billion bushels and 193 
billion bushels respectively in a report released after thursdays 
close 
a higherthanexpected wheatcrop estimate of 204 billion 
bushels held traders attention for most of the day supporting the 
wheat futures and keeping the corn and soybean markets from falling 
but when some of the big players started selling soybeans near 
the close others rushed to join them and soybeans for november 
delivery fell rapidly below 550 a bushel to the markets lowest 
close since at least nov 11 1987 
although the crop report didnt precipitate a major decline in 
the soybean market at the opening a combination of that and 
other seasonal factors led to some pressure in the second half to 
the session said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
at the close soybeans were 2 cents to 9 cents lower with the 
november contract at 545 a bushel wheat futures were 5 cents 
lower to cent higher with december at 406 a bushel corn 
futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 234

common cause today asked the senate ethics 
committee to investigate the activities of five senators who 
intervened on behalf of a california savings institution after 
receiving large campaign contributions from its owner 
at the same time the group called on the justice department to 
determine whether charles h keating jr and the savings and loan 
association he heads violated federal election laws 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
eventually collapsed and was seized by the government in april 
analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers 2 billion to 
protect the institutions depositors 
fred wertheimer president of common cause a selfstyled 
citizens lobby called for ethics committee investigations of five 
senators who met with regulators in april 1987 at the request of 
keating chairman of american continental corp lincolns parent 
the five are sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john glenn dohio john mccain rariz and donald w 
riegle jr dmich 
mccain and deconcini today pledged their full cooperation with 
any probe mccain in letters to the ethics panel and justice 
department added i am fully confident that i engaged in no 
unethical conduct 
cranstons spokesman murray flander said the senator met with 
regulators only to urge them to bring their lengthy examination of 
lincoln to a conclusion not to influence its outcome 
the other senators offices did not respond immediately to 
requests for comment 
common cause along with rep newt gingrich rga requested 
the ethics investigation last year that eventually led to the 
downfall of former house speaker jim wright dtexas 
wright was also accused of intervening with regulators on behalf 
of sampl owners but wertheimer said i think we have a different 
case different circumstances 
after three years of examinations and audits regulators seized 
lincoln on april 14 last month they filed a 11 billion civil 
lawsuit charging keating his family and associates with fraud and 
racketeering among the allegations are that keating diverted money 
from lincoln to fund his personal political and charitable 
convictions 
all five senators received campaign contributions from keating 
riegle now chairman of the senate banking committee returned his 
a year later and deconcini last month 
wertheimer said the senate ethics committee should appoint a 
special counsel to determine whether the intervention violated the 
code of ethics for government service that prohibits members of 
congress from accepting favors or benefits under circumstances 
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the 
performance of governmental duties 
in a letter today he asked gerald e mcdowell chief of the 
justice departments public integrity section to determine whether 
keatings contribution to the senators violated federal election 
laws or other statutes 
meanwhile the house banking committee in preparation for four 
public hearings on the case voted thursday to subpoena keating 
we already know that in lincoln we have on our hands a case 
that will cost the savings an loan insurance fund at least 2 
billion house banking panel chairman rep henry b gonzalez said 
in a statement this committee is required to determine what 
went wrong within the regulatory agencies 
also subpoenaed thursday by the house panel were l william 
seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp m danny 
wall director of the office of thrift supervision william 
crawford california savings and loan commissioner and other 
officials 
the hearings are expected to focus on why wall as the nations 
top sampl regulator delayed action from mid1987 until april on a 
recommendation from field examiners that the government take 
control of lincoln 
the panel on a 410 vote approved the subpoenas legal orders 
to appear before the committee or produce documents rep frank 
annunzio dill voted present explaining later that he 
believed the committee was unfairly creating the impression that 
those receiving subpoenas are guilty 
the banking committee hearings are scheduled for tuesday and for 
oct 24 oct 31 and nov 7 
keating tentatively scheduled to testify at the last of the 
hearings issued a statement through a spokesman in washington 
saying he had not decided whether to appear voluntarily 
he wants to cooperate with the committee to the maximum extent 
possible but in light of the number and complexity of the legal 
proceedings in which he is involved he wants to reflect on this 
decision said the spokesman leonard bickwit 
gonzalez dtexas noted that seidman requested subpoenas so 
that the agencys testimony may be complete and the necessary 
documents provided without incurring additional legal risks 
california regulators made a similar request he said 
gonzalez said the committee did not intend to cause 
unnecessary problems for the lawsuits surrounding lincoln and 
american continental but said there is no question about the 
paramount rights of the legislative branch in this area 
also subpoenaed was edwin j gray walls predecessor who met 
in april 1987 with four senators regarding keatings complaints he 
was being unfairly targeted by regulators riegle did not meet with 
gray but attended a second meeting with officials from the 
agencys san francisco office

the average had plunged 115 points amid news that a

the american airlines political action 
committee has contributed more than 19000 this year to the 
campaigns of 21 members of a house committee expected to vote 
monday on legislation to forestall donald trumps proposed 75 
billion takeover of the carrier 
federal election commission records for the first six months of 
1989 show that the pac that represents american airlines has given 
money to the campaigns of nearly twothirds of the 34 members of 
the house aviation subcommittee 
chairman james l oberstar dminn has received 5000 and the 
panels ranking republican rep william f clinger jr of 
pennsylvania has received 350 
the two along with rep glenn anderson dcalif chairman of 
the public works and transportation committee ranking republican 
john paul hammerschmidt of arkansas and rep peter a defazio 
dore are sponsors of airline takeover legislation moving quickly 
through the house that would benefit american 
anderson hammerschmidt and defazio have also received american 
airlines pac contributions this year the pac has given members of 
the full committee a total of 22350 in the first six months of 
the year 
democratic rep pete geren of texas recently elected to fill 
the seat vacated by house speaker jim wright is seeking an 
assignment to the panel he has received 10000 
five members of the senate commerce science and transportation 
committee have also received 8000 this year from the pac the 
panel has already approved legislation similar to the measure in 
the house subcommittee 
a pac separate from the corporation is funded by voluntary 
contributions from company officers directors managers and 
shareholders 
spokesmen for the airline did not immediately return phone calls 
friday to answer questions on the subject 
the house bill introduced wednesday would give the 
transportation department up to 50 days to review any acquisition 
of 15 percent or more of the stock of a major air carriers voting 
stock 
the bill would cover trumps offer to buy american airlines 
parent company amr corp which the company is resisting and the 
proposed purchase of ual corp parent of united air lines 
the senate version approved in committee last week sets the 
acquisition threshhold at 25 percent of an airlines stock and 
gives dot 90 days to block a takeover 
an amendment is being drafted that would make the bill 
retroactive to oct 1 to cover amr and possibly ual 
the senate is scheduled to vote after it completes work on 
legislation to reduce the budget deficit officials said the house 
aviation subcommittee has scheduled a hearing followed by a vote 
on monday with the transportation committee expected to act 
tuesday 
sponsors of the house bill had sought a transportation committee 
vote on their legislation the day after its introduction but 
agreed to allow a hearing in the aviation subcommittee after 
several republicans objected to such a fasttrack approach 
this is not a kneejerk reaction strictly to the american 
bid oberstar spokesman jim berard said about the house bill 
but oberstar is moving quickly because of the american and 
united takeover attempts berard said 
american and united are the largest carriers in the country in 
an industry dominated by just a halfdozen airlines and oberstar 
wants to be sure passenger safety is not compromised by a buyers 
heavy debt berard said 
the airlines know hes honest know where hes coming from 
berard said hell be fair with the airlines hes not going to 
bash them unnecessarily when public safety is in question hell 
ask the tough questions 
oberstar also received 3300 from the pac in 198788 
according to fec records the american airlines pac in 1987 and 
1988 contributed to the campaigns of all but two members of the 
house aviation subcommittee and all but about a dozen of the full 
transportation committee 
the pac gave 32150 to house transportation committee members 
and 11166 to members of the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee

sales were off 287 percent from early october of 1988 
the eight usbased manufacturers said they sold vehicles at an 
average daily rate of 30626 compared with a rate of 34867 during 
the same time last year 
car sales for all makers were down 131 percent in early october 
while truck sales were off 104 percent 
ford motor cos earlyoctober car and truck sales were down 03 
percent and chrysler corps sales were off 23 percent 
there had been speculation that fourthquarter sales this year 
would be significantly softer than during the third quarter in 
early october last year sales were relatively soft compared with 
earlier periods and with what proved to be the average annual sales 
rate 
part of the reason for predictions of a soft fourth quarter was 
the expectation that consumers would flock to showrooms to pick up 
1989 models to beat the price 990 models 
it was difficult to determine friday whether that was a factor 
in the decline in sales there still are 1989 models for sale some 
with attractive rebates and lowinterest financing deals 
chrysler on friday announced the average price for its 1990 cars 
would be 5 percent more than for 1989 versions earlier ford 
announced an average increase of 49 percent and gm said its 1990 
prices would be 34 percent higher 
for the calendar year so far domestic cars and trucks are 
selling at an average daily rate of 38236 compared with a rate of 
38773 through oct 10 last year a decline of 14 percent 
car sales for the year are running 25 percent behind last 
years pace while truck sales are 06 percent ahead

chrysler corp on friday said its 
1990 cars would cost an average of 5 percent more than in 1989 
it was the same increase as chryslers preintroduction prices 
announced earlier and the largest price increase among the big 
three 
earlier ford motor co announced a 49 percent increase and 
general motors corp an increase of 34 percent 
chrysler like gm and ford said about half the price increase 
was due to government requirements for air bags or automatic seat 
belts for frontseat passengers 
all of chryslers us built cars are equipped with 
driversside air bags as standard equipment chrysler said air 
bags accounted for 3 percentage points in the increase 
this modest increase reflects our intention to be price 
competitive said chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald 
base prices for the no 3 automakers 1990 cars range from 
6995 for the dodge omni and plymouth horizon hatchback to 25495 
for the chrysler imperial

the banking industrys overall profitably is 
masking weakness in the northeast where real estate loans are 
causing increasing problems industry analyst alex sheshunoff said 
friday 
real estate is often the industrys achilles heel he said 
sheshunoff singled out new york massachusetts and connecticut 
as trouble spots 
i dont think that new england is about to become known as 
little texas he said but youre starting to see a replay of 
what happened in texas in some markets in the northeast 
banking problems have been centered in texas and the southwest 
where failures have set records each of the last two years 
sheshunoff said the worst has passed in that region 
the level of nonperforming loans and the return to 
profitability indicate that this region is beginning to bottom 
out sheshunoff said we anticipate that the regional economy 
and its banks will be climbing back but not bouncing back 
during the first half of the year three states reported overall 
losses arizona 1323 million texas 987 million and 
louisiana 315 million 
nationally earnings were 141 billion with 90 percent of the 
nations banks making a profit sheshunoff said 
but those earnings do not reflect some underlying problems 
particularly in northeastern states he said 
particularly worrisome is the fact that real estate loans have 
constituted the fastest growing segment of bank lending not only in 
this quarter but for the past five years sheshunoff said 
unfortunately some of this real estate lending financed 
speculative excesses which will take time to be absorbed often at 
significantly reduced prices with resulting loan losses 
just thursday two large new york banks reported combined losses 
of 11 billion in the third quarter a large portion of the losses 
came from increased reserves for loans to third world nations 
included in those losses was 300 million set aside by chemical 
banking co to cover possible losses on nonperforming loans 
those three months past due at texas commerce bancshares inc a 
chemical subsidiary 
in every major bank on the east coast there is now somebody 
taking a much harder look at their real estate loans and seeing if 
they need to increase their reserves said sheshunoff 
sheshunoff said 577 percent of all nonperforming loans in 
massachusetts were on real estate 46 percent in connecticut and 
154 percent in new york 
overall new york had the largest amount of nonperforming loans 
at 222 billion reflecting the large concentration of loans to 
third world banks in the money center banks 
maine had the largest increase during the first half of the 
year as nonperforming loans increased 613 percent followed by 
new hampshire at 565 percent and massachusetts at 443 percent 
were just starting to see some of the effects of the 
speculative excesses that have occurred in those regional real 
estate markets sheshunoff said by telephone from his austin 
office in texas its the aftermath in the northeast its been 
really building for the last five years

if youre looking skyward to see whether 
american airlines has donald trumps name on it yet or klm owns 
part of northwest you may miss those saabfords gmjaguars or 
renaultvolvos barreling down the road 
like their transportation counterparts in the air the 
automakers of the world are reaching out to each other to form 
strategic relationships that reflect increasingly brutal 
competition on the ground 
these alliances are coming against a backdrop of trouble in the 
us car market by far the most lucrative for any major automaker 
there are signs that ford motor co general motors corp and 
chrysler corp all could report thirdquarter losses on north 
american automotive operations because of slow sales and costly 
incentives aimed at luring buyers if so it would be the worst 
showing by the big three since the 1982 recession 
problems in the american market have spilled over to europe 
where several major automakers are struggling because they arent 
selling as many cars in the united states 
aggravating matters for them is the impending relaxation of 
trade barriers in the 12nation common market in 1992 this will 
make it much easier for example to buy a fiat in france a 
renault in italy or a rover in spain that means the makers of 
those cars face more competition from their neighbors 
moreover competition from the aggressive japanese is hurting 
both american and european carmakers nissan motor corp honda 
motor ltd and toyota motor corp already have wellestablished 
assembly operations in the united states a response to detroits 
efforts years ago to restrict foreign imports 
toyota said this past week it plans to double vehiclebuilding 
capacity in the united states within the next five years toyota 
and other japanese carmakers are now moving quickly to establish 
plants in europe before 1992 
these developments have forced many automakers to reassess their 
ability to sell vehicles all over the world for the weaker 
competitors that has meant forging alliances with stronger rivals 
or each other 
this past week renault of france and ab volvo of sweden 
disclosed they have begun talks aimed at exploring a possible 
merger or collaboration in truck or car manufucturing both 
companies have been finding it increasingly difficult to sell cars 
in the united states 
earlier in the week britains moneylosing jaguar plc said it 
was mulling whether to sell a minority stake to gm and was 
discussing possible joint manufacturing and marketing ventures with 
the biggest us automaker 
jaguars move was partly a defensive response to unwelcome 
overtures by ford which had earlier expressed interest in buying 
all or part of the luxury carmaker and had received us antitrust 
clearance to purchase up to 15 percent 
ford also has expressed interest in buying all or part of saab 
the swedish carmaker that has been suffering weak sales in the 
united states but has significant truckmaking operations in europe 
in other business and economic news this past week 
signs of higher inflation and the collapse of a big buyout for 
airline giant ual corp sent the stock market plummeting in the 
worst day since the oct 19 1987 collapse almost exactly two years 
earlier 
mgmua communications co scrapped its agreement to be acquired 
by qintex australia ltd for 15 billion because of financing 
problems the collapse of that deal opened the way for resumption 
of takeover talks with other possible interested buyers of one of 
the largest american entertainment concerns 
despite little or no movement to resolve a machinists union 
strike at boeing co the aerospace giant received an order 
potentially worth 5 billion from northwest airlines the order was 
considered a blow to boeings european rival airbus industrie 
which had hoped for a longstanding relationship with northwest 
after securing a 32 billion order from the carrier three years 
ago

truck sales led an 119 percent decline in earlyoctober vehicle

first in what analysts have said would be a soft threemonth period

their cars and light trucks sold at an average rate of 30734 a day

industry leaders car and truck sales were off 256 percent for the 
period 
ford motor cos total vehicle sales were down 03 percent in 
early october and chrysler corps were off 23 percent 
gms sales dive may have been spurred by its program of 
rewarding dealers who cleared out stocks of 1989 vehicles before 
sept 30 the end of the 1989 model year 
we had a strong strong strong month of september and also i 
think there is a lull here in some of the buying gm spokesman 
terry sullivan said one cannot judge a year on 10 days 
for the year to date gms car sales were down 62 percent while 
truck sales were up 24 percent at ford yeartodate car sales 
were up 01 percent and truck sales were down 2 percent while at 
chrysler car sales were off 111 percent and truck sales were up 
02 percent 
for months as word of 1990 model price increases spread 
analysts and others have been saying sales in the fourth quarter of 
this year would be considerably softer than during the third 
quarter when incentives helped 
that payback may be coming true said analyst tom webb of 
the national automobile dealers association 
sixty to 75 percent of the early october sales should have 
been 90s he said 
webb said he wanted to see how sales go later in the month 
before saying whether the payback was under way 
gm said its cars sold at an average daily rate of 8538 during 
the early october period this year compared with a rate of 11273 
during the same period last year its earlyoctober truck sales 
were reported at an average daily rate of 3654 compared with a

on the news that a big buyout deal for ual corp had fallen through 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials nosedived 19058 points 
or 691 percent to 256926 that marked its second biggest point 
drop ever exceeded only by the 508point loss recorded on black 
monday oct 19 1987 
just four days ago the average hit a record closing high of 
279141 
the market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most 
of the session until the group planning to buy ual said it had been 
unable to get enough bank financing for the transaction it had 
planned 
that quickly cast a pall over shares of ual and other companies 
that have been involved in or are planning debtfinanced deals 
brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve 
among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the 
market for highyielding junk bonds 
earlier the labor department reported that the producer price 
index of finished goods rose 09 percent in september abruptly 
reversing a series of declines through the summer months 
the ual news was the trigger for the whole thing said 
newton zinder an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc

still very vivid

currency dealers pounded down the dollar friday 
in hectic selling incited by the worst stock plunge since the crash 
two years ago 
harried traders reported an atmosphere of alarm suddenly 
engulfed the currency markets late in the afternoon as stock prices 
skidded on the new york stock exchange 
it just seemed everybody wanted to sell dollars it was just a 
mass panic said thomas palladino an assistant vice president at 
the new york office of the amsterdam rotterdam bank 
the intensity of the stock market selloff was especially 
unnerving because it occurred almost two years to the day after the 
worst wall street crash ever there was an eerie sense of deja 
vu said kevin laurie manager of treasury operations at the bank 
of boston in new york the dollar reacted to it pretty 
violently 
the widely watched dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
plunged 19058 points to 256926 the largest drop since the crash 
on oct 19 1987 other stock indices also fell sharply 
dollar sales bred additional selling as the dollar sank below 
thresholds that professional traders had designated as stop 
loss levels in stoploss maneuvers traders sell to guard 
against possibly losing more money in case a market slide continues 
the drop in the dollar was exaggerated by the diminished trading 
volume that is typical for friday afternoons 
on fridays banks stop dealing directly with one another earlier 
than on other days of the week which reduces liquidity in the 
market price movements have a greater impact when liquidity is low 
dealers said they expected the dollar to lose additional ground 
against other major currencies in asian trading over the weekend 
initially on friday two economic reports had encouraged some 
dollar buying a 09 percent surge in the us producer price index 
during september and a rise of 05 percent in retail sales 
indicated that interest rates would not decline anytime soon 
the early enthusiasm for dollars was dampened somewhat however 
by unconfirmed reports that central banks had sold dollars to keep 
the currency in check 
by the time trading was done for the day in new york the dollar 
stood at 14205 yen down from 14415 yen on thursday the loss of 
about 2 yen was unusually large 
earlier in tokyo the dollar fell to 14400 japanese yen from 
14460 yen at thursdays close and in london it edged up to 14410 
yen 
the british pound benefited from the dollars decline a pound 
fetched 15820 late in new york vs 15527 thursday in earlier 
london dealings the pound rose to 15625 from 15520 late 
thursday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with thursdays 
late rates included 18720 west german marks down from 19075 
16420 swiss francs down from 16735 634375 french francs down 
from 64670 137600 italian lire down from 139925 and 
117385 canadian dollars down from 11749 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late thursdays 
rates included 19025 west german marks down from 19068 16720 
swiss francs up from 16715 64562 french francs down from 
64650 21465 dutch guilders down from 21510 139650 italian 
lire down from 139750 and 11750 canadian dollars up from

gold prices registered little reaction to the slump in stocks 
and the dollar 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery closed at 36330 a troy ounce 10 cents lower than

a sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a 
rebound in wholesale price inflation in september wiping out three 
rare monthly declines this summer the government said friday 
the 09 percent increase in the labor departments producer 
price index measuring inflation one stop short of the retail 
level represented a return to the high inflation rates experienced 
in the first five months of the year 
analysts were not overly concerned however they noted that 
nearly all of the gain in the index can be attributed to two 
special factors an unusually large and probably onetime rise in 
oil costs and a shift in seasonal patterns that made a modest drop 
in auto prices look like a large increase 
if you take out the seasonals for autos and the energy blip 
which i think is just a rebound from declines we had this summer 
it suggests inflations just not that bad said economist john 
silvia of kemper financial services inc 
nevertheless stock prices fell in early trading after the data 
was interpreted as an indication the federal reserve board will not 
lower interest rates soon 
these figures are appropriate for friday the 13th and seem 
destined to strike terror into the hearts of financial markets 
said economist gordon richards of the national association of 
manufacturers 
the market also was reacting to a commerce department report 
showing a strongerthanexpected 05 percent increase in retail 
sales last month the seventh consecutive rise 
later in the day the market fell sharply on news that a 
labormanagement group had failed to secure financing for a 
proposed 675 billion takeover of ual corp parent of united 
airlines the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled 
19058 points to 256926 the steepest drop since the 1987 crash 
in a balancing act the central bank is trying to keep interest 
rates high enough to control inflationary pressures but low enough 
to avoid a recession the gain in retail sales indicated some 
bouyancy in the economy dashing traders hope for fed easing 
those hopes had been kindled last week by a labor department report 
showing manufacturers lost 103000 jobs in september 
the business council composed of 100 top business leaders 
gathering for a conference in the resort town of hot springs va 
predicted friday that the economy will continue to soften in 1990 
and may even topple into a recession unless the fed cuts interest 
rates 
the climb last month in wholesale prices wiped out consecutive 
declines of 04 percent in august and july and 01 percent in june 
that brought the annual wholesale inflation rate for the first nine 
months of the year to 51 percent compared with 40 percent in all 
of 1988 
contributing to the big september jump was a fluke in the 
measurement of auto prices which were skewed because manufacturers 
offered their endofthemodelyear price incentives earlier in the 
summer than usual 
when monthtomonth increases were adjusted for normal seasonal 
variations auto prices rose 38 percent in september when 
seasonal adjustments are factored out auto prices actually 
declined 05 percent 
energy prices which had fallen in june july and august shot 
up 65 percent last month fuel oil prices rose 163 percent 
gasoline 106 percent and natural gas 34 percent 
thats an exceptionally high increase which will not be 
repeated but that doesnt mean energy prices are coming down 
said economist allen sinai of the boston co 
in good news the department said food prices dropped 06 
percent following a 03 percent gain a month earlier vegetable 
prices were down 161 percent turkeys 49 percent pasta 44 
percent and beef 40 percent prices for pork fish fruit and 
rice also fell 
excluding the usually volatile food and energy categories 
prices rose 07 percent in september following a 05 percent 
increase in august the cost of home furnishings health products 
magazines floor coverings tobacco and alcoholic beverages all 
rose last month 
the 09 percent gain in the overall wholesale price index for 
finished goods left it at 1135 meaning that a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11350 
last month 
two measures of prices earlier in the production process also 
rose intermediate goods increased 04 percent after three 
successive drops and crude goods jumped 11 percent partly 
offsetting a 10 percent decline in august examples of the three 
processing stages finished intermediate and crude are bread 
flour and wheat

the lobbying group common cause asked the 
justice department and a senate panel friday to investigate the 
intervention of five senators in the regulation of whats expected 
to become the nations costliest sampl collapse 
common cause along with rep newt gingrich rga requested 
the ethics investigation last year that eventually led to the 
resignation of house speaker jim wright dtexas 
fred wertheimer president of common cause asked the senate 
ethics committee to determine whether sens alan cranston 
dcalif dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz john 
glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich violated ethics 
rules when they met with regulators in april 1987 concerning 
lincoln savings and loan association irvine calif 
all five had received substantial campaign contributions from 
phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr chairman of american 
continental corp lincolns parent 
at the same time the group called on the justice department to 
determine whether keating and lincoln violated federal election 
laws in their efforts to influence the senators 
the joint intervention into a case involving alleged 
violations by a specific company appears to be an extraordinary 
action wertheimer said 
lincoln which is insolvent was seized by federal regulators on 
april 14 after more than two years of audits and examinations 
analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers 2 billion to 
protect the institutions depositors 
last month the government filed a 11 billion civil lawsuit 
charging keating his family and associates with fraud and 
racketeering among the allegations are that keating diverted money 
from lincoln to fund his personal political and charitable 
convictions 
leonard bickwit an attorney representing keatings company 
defended the millionaires right to contribute to and seek help 
from the senators 
mr keating and the organizations hes been in association 
with had every right to make these contributions which were within 
the limits of the law he also has the right to seek the support of 
his representatives on matters of importance to him and he ought 
not to be more restricted in that regard than others who have not 
contributed bickwit said reading a prepared statement 
according to common cause keating contributed 850000 to three 
private organizations founded or controlled by cranston and 47000 
to cranstons campaigns 200000 to a political committee 
controlled by glenn as well as a 34000 campaign contribution 
campaign contributions of 112000 and free jet flights valued at 
13433 to mccain and his family 76100 to riegles campaign and 
55000 to deconcinis election effort 
riegle returned the contribution in march 1988 deconcini last 
month mccain reimbursed american continental for the jet flights 
but has not given back the 112000 
the five senators all issued statements pledging their 
cooperation with any probe mccain in letters to the ethics panel 
and justice department added i am fully confident that i 
engaged in no unethical conduct 
cranston said he met with regulators to urge them to bring their 
lengthy examination of lincoln to a conclusion not to influence 
its outcome i did not violate any ethics rules or standards 
he said 
riegle said he attended the meeting only at the request of 
mccain and deconcini and said his conduct was entirely proper 
wertheimer said the senate ethics committee should appoint a 
special counsel to determine whether the intervention violated the 
code of ethics for government service that prohibits members of 
congress from accepting favors or benefits under circumstances 
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the 
performance of governmental duties 
in a letter he asked gerald e mcdowell chief of the justice 
departments public integrity section to determine whether 
keatings contribution to the senators violated federal election 
laws or other statutes 
in the case against wright the former speaker also was accused 
of intervening with regulators on behalf of sampl owners but 
wertheimer said i think we have a different case different 
circumstances 
meanwhile the house banking committee in preparation for four 
public hearings on the case beginning next week voted thursday to 
subpoena keating and regulators who oversaw his institution 
the hearings are expected to focus on why m danny wall as the 
nations top sampl regulator delayed action from mid1987 until 
april on a recommendation from field examiners that the government 
take control of lincoln

banking regulators friday ordered financially 
troubled centrust bank to cease dividend payments to shareholders 
and halt any stock repurchases 
the decision by the federal office of thrift supervision angered 
the chairman of the miamibased institution who said a proposed 
150 million sale of nearly all its branches would restore 
financial stability 
we regret the issuance of the directive which came as a total 
surprise to us said david l paul chairman and chief executive 
officer at centrust which grew since 1983 into the largest thrift 
in the southeast 
centrust is seeking federal approval to sell 63 of its 71 
branches and all the accounts in the branches to great western 
bank of beverly hills calif the branches have more than 24 
billion in deposits 
centrust would be left with eight dade county branches holding 
about 800 million in deposits 
if the regulators would approve the transaction they would 
allow us to solve our problems and we would hope continue to pay 
our dividends said paul in a news release we will use our 
best efforts to try to convince our regulators that the suspension 
of dividends is not in their best interest or those of the 
institution we hope they will reverse their decision 
centrust has two classes of preferred stock both of which were 
affected by the dividend ruling 
both stocks closed down 350 to 475 on overthecounter 
trading friday 
with losses of about 16 million for the first half of this 
year centrust has come under pressure from regulators to improve 
performance and streamline operations 
centrust has shrunk from more than 10 billion in assets to 
about 9 billion in recent months the institution also has been 
criticized for a host of highrisk or unusual investments 
paul who took over the insolvent dade federal savings in 1983 
was ordered by regulators to sell a collection of paintings 
purchased with centrust funds

paglinawan said the impact of jc penneys orders which he 
said have a value of 30 million to 50 million will be felt

junk bond prices plunged friday as financing 
problems for a major airline buyout widened fears over a possible 
collapse of the slumping 200 billion market of the highyield 
securities 
news that bidders had failed to raise financing for the planned 
675 billion buyout of ual corp parent of united airlines also 
spread panic that billions of dollars in other planned 
debtfinanced deals would have to be scrapped 
no one thinks this is the bottom said a highyield bond 
trader at a major wall street firm who asked not to be named 
the decline friday came in what already has been the worst 
shakeout ever in the junk bond market which boomed in the 1980s on 
a wave of highly leveraged takeovers financed by the highrisk 
securities 
the junk bond market decline began in september when campeau 
corp had to get a 250 million loan to meet its junk bond 
obligations since then ohio mattress co scrapped a 475 million 
issue and ramada inc postponed indefinitely a 400 million issue 
prices of junk bonds so named because of their low credit 
ratings dropped for the 17th straight day friday traders said 
the afternoon plunge was triggered by the 190point drop on the new 
york stock exchanges dow jones industrials average the worst this 
year which had been sparked by news of the ual financing failure 
junk bond issues were down on average about 1 points to 2 
points or as much as 20 for every 1000 in face amount rjr 
holdings capital corp bonds considered a quality issue 
plummeted 3 points rh macy amp co bonds plunged 2 points 
western union bonds droppped a whopping 15 points in part 
because of reports of a possible bankruptcy filing quantum 
chemicals considered a less attractive issue fell from 5 points 
to 7 points traders said 
theres an eerie silence in the junk bond market theres no 
trading taking place said john lonski senior economist at 
moodys investors service a major credit rating agency 
we face the problem of an eventual selloff where a number of 
junk bond holders will just want to get out and assume significant 
losses in the process he said 
gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult 
because most trading takes place overthecounter that is 
between dealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond 
instead of in bidding on an open exchange 
that same characteristic also can heighten big selloffs by 
making it more difficult to find buyers when the market is weak or 
falling 
very few junk bonds are listed on the american and new york 
stock exchanges and tallies on overall market volume are not 
available daily 
failure of the ual deal heightened fears because while part of 
the financing was expected to come from junk bonds traditional 
bank financing was to play a major role 
if banks backed off that its not a good sign for the rest of 
the market lonski said 
about 11 billion in new junk bond offerings from companies 
including continental airlines blockbuster entertainment grand 
union and cnw corps chicago amp north western railroad are 
scheduled to occur by the end of the year

executives of the countrys largest 
corporations were generally at a loss to explain fridays huge drop 
in the stock market although some suggested that it could be a good 
thing if it cools speculative fever 
the market plunge was an unwelcome intrusion on the annual 
meeting of the business council the chief executive officers of 
the nations 100 largest corporations 
many of them learned of the sudden plunge while out on the golf 
course at the posh mountain resort where the conference is held 
executives swapped details of how their own stock had faired 
but few were willing to give snap judgements about what went wrong 
they said they had heard only sketchy details about the overall 
decline 
they also were not willing to forecast what direction the market 
might take when it reopens on monday 
howard p allen head of southern california edison co said 
that he did not buy the explanation offered widely on wall street 
that the market drop was fueled entirely by the failure of the 
buyout deal for united airlines 
i think that there has to be something more fundamental that 
caused the crash he said 
asked if he was concerned about the huge selloff john 
mcgillicuddy head of manufacturers hanover corp said anytime 
you have the market drop by 197 points if you arent concerned 
theres something wrong with you 
the drop in the dow jones average was actually 19058 at the 
close of trading 
allen murray chairman of mobil corp said the market plunge 
could turn out to be a good thing if it leads to a flight to 
quality stocks and away from heavy speculation about takeover 
possibilities 
john akers the head of ibm corp noted fridays decline was 
nowhere near as violent as the 508point drop which occurred on 
oct 19 1987 
but akers said he was concerned that the rash of company 
takeovers had left many corporations so deeply in debt that they 
could be in serious trouble the next time interest rates increase

stockindex futures trading on the chicago 
mercantile exchange was halted twice friday as tumbling stock 
prices triggered circuit breakers designed to prevent a rapid 
computerdriven collapse 
it was the first time the market had fallen far enough to 
trigger 30minute halts in trading since the circuit breakers were 
installed a year after the stock markets october 1987 collapse 
the program was enacted to provide a series of market breaks in 
hopes that pauses in trading would discourage panic selling 
but some critics of the program argued that the circuit breakers 
could have the opposite effect contributing to a frenzied rush to 
sell 
the first 30minute halt occurred about 2 pm cdt after the 
mercs contract for december delivery of stocks tracked by the 
standard amp poors 500 index had fallen 12 points from thursdays 
close to 34685 
a 12point drop in the index corresponds to a 100point drop in 
the dow jones industrial average 
at that point traders were not allowed to execute any more sell 
orders at lower prices until trading resumed at 230 pm cdt 
when trading resumed the market traded back and forth for about 
10 minutes then plunged to 32885 30 points below thursdays 
close triggering a second 30minute pause in trading below that 
price at about 245 pm traders said 
the second trading halt extended through the markets 315 pm 
closing time 
a lessdramatic circuit breaker was triggered on march 17 when 
the sampp 500 futures opened with a 5point loss triggering a 
10minute halt to selling followed by a twominute halt to all 
trading said merc spokeswoman iris poliski on that day the dow 
jones industrial average fell 48 points 
robert ray a stockindex trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
in chicago said the market plunged on news that a group seeking to 
buy ual corp had been unable to obtain financing which triggered 
new doubts about the market for highyielding highrisk junk bonds 
institutional investors use stockindex futures to hedge against 
losses in the stock market sometimes employing computerdriven 
program trading strategies that can cause wild swings in prices on 
both markets 
ray said he sympathized with program traders who tried to cut 
their losses when the dow started sliding toward what would become 
a loss of nearly 191 points on the day 
from the program trading end i cant blame those guys ray 
said at one point i dont think they could tell where the 
markets were 
the chicago merc the worlds largest market for sampp 500 
futures installed the trading limits last year as part of a 
coordinated effort with the new york stock exchange to prevent 
another market collapse like the 508point drop in the dow jones 
industrial average that occurred on oct 19 1987 
under the coordinated program between the merc and the nyse the 
next trigger point would have come had the dow jones industrial 
average fallen 250 points from thursdays close the dow never 
dipped that low on friday but if it had the procedures called for 
a onehour halt in all stock trading on the nyse a decline of 
another 150 points on the same day would have triggered an 
additional twohour delay

donald trumps proposed 7 billion buyout of amr 
corp already surrounded by skepticism was placed in further 
doubt friday by a stock market drop blamed in part on problems in 
another airline buyout analysts said 
this seems to poison the atmosphere at the very least for 
airline buyouts involving a lot of debt said one industry 
analyst who asked not to be named 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks fell 19058 points 
after a managementpilot group said it could not obtain financing 
for a 675 billion buyout of ual corp parent of united airlines 
trump has proposed a 120pershare buyout of fort worthbased 
amr the parent of american airlines but the company has not 
responded beyond a promise that it will consider the offer 
although it prefers to remain independent 
trump has said he will include 1 billion of equity in his 
offer but has provided no other financing details leading to 
skepticism over his ability to complete the deal 
amrs stock price slippped to 9862 friday in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange before trading halted in 
the mad selloff during the last hour of business trading was 
stopped because of an imbalance of orders for amr with many more 
sellers than buyers 
although the close was down just 12 cents from thursday it 
represented a 462 drop during the day amr had climbed to 
10325 before its slide began in early afternoon 
the close was also the stocks lowest price since trumps offer 
was disclosed oct 5 analysts expect the stock to continue to 
trade far below the level of trumps offer until there is a 
significant move by either side 
amr officials would not comment on fridays market developments 
trump officials in new york did not return telephone calls 
analysts said trump will have to lower his price if he expects 
to pull off the deal 
if you look at historys precedents those situations that 
were in an arbitrage environment were materially altered by market 
swings on the downside said airline analyst kevin burke in 
charlotte nc

striking boeing co production workers announced 
plans friday for a march on company headquarters while the 
aerospace manufacturer prepared to make its fifth plane delivery 
since the walkout began 
no date has been set for a resumption of contract negotiations 
which ended oct 2 two days before the strike started industry 
analysts said the strike almost certainly would last another week 
and possibly two months or more 
the 57800 boeing employees represented by the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers were enjoying 
donations of pizza supermarket food and other support they also 
were being advised on ways to prepare for financial marital and 
other pressures 
linda lanham of machinists district lodge 751 representing 
43300 boeing workers in the puget sound area said legislators 
members of congress and state and national labor leaders were being 
invited to a rally at the union hall and a march to boeings 
corporate headquarters oct 21 
she said she hoped at least 2000 people would participate 
meanwhile boeing was preparing to deliver the fifth plane since 
the strike began oct 4 a 747400 for china air of taiwan said 
chief corporate spokesman harold carr the planes were already 
assembled before the walkout and nonstriking employees have been 
putting the finishing touches on them the company says it has 
about three dozen more planes that might be prepared for delivery 
while the workers are on strike 
boeing said friday that martinair holland has ordered four more 
widebody 767300er jetliners worth approximately 326 million 
so far this month boeing has received orders and options for 
106 planes worth approximately 75 billion for the year boeing 
has received firm orders for 792 planes worth about 423 billion 
an industry record 
wolfgang demisch of ubs securities in new york said that nobody 
had expected a strike to last less than two weeks so after this 
weekend the real strike begins so to speak 
talks could resume in the next week and in the next two weeks 
i think you might see some tangible motion demisch said 
ive said one to two months all along and i dont see any 
reason to change that said william whitlow of dain bosworth in 
seattle 
boeings threeyear offer included wage hikes of 4 percent 3 
percent and 3 percent bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay this year 
and 3 percent in 1990 a costofliving clause almost matching 
inflation a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in some 
benefits the unions are seeking bigger wage increases less 
reliance on bonuses and an end to mandatory overtime 
by late friday no union members in the region were known to be 
facing eviction or other financial crises but enough were worried 
to keep five people almost constantly on the phone in the unions 
local welfare office said lou kiefer a specialist from iam 
headquarters in washington dc 
similar services were being offered to union members in wichita 
kan portland ore and lesser boeing job sites in montana 
hawaii california utah and other states 
kiefer said creditors generally were agreeing to accept reduced 
or delayed payments during the duration of the strike 
when they get a creditor thats uncooperative they call us 
and in some cases we call the creditor he said 
we tell them well take some pickets off the line and bring 
them over to the loan company kiefer said we havent had one 
hold out on us yet 
under federal law the strikers are being offered five options 
for paying to retain some health accident death and disability 
insurance coverage said kiefer and al wydick another health and 
welfare specialist 
without any advance word a local pizza company sent delivery 
trucks with hot pizzas for pickets at a number of plant gates 
lanham said 
pat newberry owner of two mcdonalds outlets loaned a 10gallon 
cooler and is donating six gallons of orangedrink mix and 600 
disposable cups a week she said 
lee frazier and rob miller are letting the union select 50 
worth of free goods from each of their three groceries every 
wednesday she said 
steve witt of the qfc supermarket in kent arranged for the union 
to get tons of produce and tons of bakery items bowman said

in response to the trading frenzy in the stock 
market friday the associated press adjusted computer filters that 
normally check the accuracy of trades reported by the exchanges 
aps computers which process the financial markets tables 
published by most newspapers are programmed to spot questionable 
trade reports and keep them out of aps database until they are 
checked 
but many of the trades friday dropped so sharply they would have 
triggered false alarms which would have delayed preparation of 
stock market tables 
normally aps computers are set to question trades that vary by 
more than 3 percent in the wake of fridays selloff the gate was 
widened to accept any trades that changed by up to 50 percent 
adjusting the filters allowed aps computers to better keep pace 
with fridays heavy trading but it also allowed some transaction 
reports that were reported erroneously by the exchanges to creep 
into aps tables 
some high and low prices were affected closing prices were not 
before processing the weekly tables published in weekend 
editions ap staffers manually reviewed the data and removed trades 
that were clearly reported incorrectly

wall street closed out its weekly business 
friday night reverberating with the echoes of the crash of 1987 
in a setting fraught with parallels to the preweekend selloff 
that served as prelude to black monday on oct 19 1987 stock 
prices took a precipitous drop in the last hour of trading friday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials finished the day down 
19058 at 256926 for a point loss exceeded in market history 
only by the 508point debacle it suffered on black monday 
the averages 21626 drop for the week ranked third in the 
record books behind declines of 23548 and 29598 oct 1216 and 
oct 1923 two years ago 
yet many wall street officials brokers and investors went home 
for the weekend hopeful that history wasnt repeating itself 
the whole situation is significantly different this time 
said joseph hardiman president of the national association of 
securities dealers the organization that oversees the 
overthecounter market 
the circumstances are not comparable and the psychology is 
much stronger now declared kenneth liebler president of the 
american stock exchange 
in 1987 the market seemed to be under assault from every 
direction interest rates were high and rising the dollar was 
under pressure in foreign exchange recession fears were mounting 
and as everyone could plainly see later on stock prices by any 
traditional measure were too high 
this time many analysts insist none of those problems are 
present the trouble they say lies in a single sore spot for the 
market credit worries and excessive speculation in corporate 
buyouts real and rumored financed with borrowed money 
the news that opened the floodgates on friday by nearly 
unanimous agreement was the disclosure by a labormanagement group 
that it couldnt get the bank loans needed to carry off its buyout 
plan for ual corp 
that was the latest in a series of events in recent weeks that 
have shaken confidence in the market for junk bonds to finance 
takeovers and prompted conjecture that the buyout boom of the 
1980s on wall street might be approaching its end 
if it is true that the market has just one identifiable foe to 
contend with the most important question left to be answered is 
whether wall street can limit the effects of the struggle to those 
stocks that have been involved in takeover deals and speculation 
that wasnt the way things looked on friday when the big blue 
chips untouched by the taint of takeovers suffered along with the 
socalled whisper stocks 
monday shapes up as a heavy day perhaps a volatile day 
hardiman acknowledged but it could be on either side 
asked specifically about the buyout problem he said to the 
extent that people have seen this coming i think it can be 
contained 
most broader measures of stock price trends ended the past week 
with losses not quite as severe as the dows 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 1142 to 
18556 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
dropped 1635 to 46729 and the amex market value index was down 
1656 at 37845 
volume on the big board averaged 16195 million shares a day 
against 17099 million the week before 
the sudden slide on friday appeared to some observers to have 
accelerated what was already being billed as the deleveraging 
of corporate america the wringing out of what many see as 
excessive use of debt in restructuring businesses of many 
descriptions 
since junk bonds were an important source of financing for the 
takeover boom difficulty in raising this form of financing dilutes 
a positive underpinning for the market said martin sass 
chairman of the investment management firm md sass investors 
services in a commentary written before fridays drop 
but from a longer term standpoint weakness in the junk bond 
market has positive implications because it will result in more 
soundly financed and conceived corporate mergers and help stem the 
sharp deterioration in corporate credit quality 
concluded hardiman the markets have a way of correcting these 
things sometimes its painful

the stock market plunge does not signal an 
economic downturn treasury secretary nicholas f brady said friday 
brady was the only high administration official to comment on 
the loss of more than 190 points in the dowjones industrial 
average 
president bush refused to answer reporters shouted questions as 
he boarded a helicopter at the white house to fly to his camp david 
retreat in maryland 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden 
who took office earlier this week spent most of the afternoon and 
early evening taking calls from members of congress and others 
shortly before 730 pm his spokeswoman mary mccue said there 
would be nothing tonight by way of comment from breeden 
also a spokesman for the federal reserve board said the central 
bank would have no comment 
but brady said todays decline should be viewed in the 
context of a 591point rise since jan 1 1989 its important to 
recognize that todays stock market decline doesnt signal any 
fundamental change in the condition of the economy 
the economy remains well balanced and the outlook is for

several air courier companies have sued the us 
postal service claiming its low price for some overseas packages 
creates unfair and illegal competition 
in a suit filed thursday in us district court in delaware the 
companies allege the governments 1075 rate for express delivery 
overseas of packages weighing eight ounces or less results in 
unfair and illegal competition between the postal service and 
private enterprise carriers 
the postal service cut its rate for that category in april from 
18 to 875 per package which it described as a special 
introductory rate in june it established a permanent rate 
of 1075 private couriers usually charge about 20 for the same 
service 
in their suit the companies ask the court to enjoin the postal 
service from offering the 1075 rate or any price that isnt 
fair and equitable they contend that the governments rate is 
below cost and that the postal service failed to get approval for 
it from the postal rate commission 
postmaster general anthony m frank defending the postal 
service pricing said the rates benefit the american householder 
and smaller businesses who dont qualify for the volume discounts 
offered to major corporations by these international couriers 
the companies filing the suit are dhl airways inc 
dworkincosell interair courier services inc federal express 
corp intertrade courier international inc tnt skypak inc and 
ups air forwarding inc two industry associations air courier 
conference of america and international express carriers conference

sony of inducing the two executives to breach their agreement so 
they could take top jobs at columbia 
late friday sonys us arm sony usa inc guber and peters 
and their company announced they had jointly filed a lawsuit 
against warner bros in connection with sonys proposed acquisition 
of guberpeters entertainment co

sony the japanese electronics and recorded music giant 
announced sept 27 that it had agreed to buy columbia for about 
34 billion

sony said it intends to name guber and peters cochairmen of the 
company once it is acquired in addition sony also has begun a 
tender offer to buy their production company guberpeters 
entertainment for 200 million 
earlier this week sonys us arm sony usa inc said it has 
waived a condition in its agreement to buy guberpeters

if the executives were unable to obtain waivers from their 
contracts with warner 
we became satisfied that the contracts represented no 
impediment to the acquisition sony spokesman jason farrow said 
friday 
in addition to 1 billion in damages the warner suit seeks 
punitive damages and an injunction preventing guber and peters from 
breaching their commitments to warner 
steven j ross cochairman and cochief executive of warner 
bros parent timewarner inc said we regret that sony has 
attempted to enter the us motion picture industry by illegally 
and willfully raiding key talent under exclusive contract to a 
competitor 
this conduct cannot must not and will not be condoned he 
said 
also named as defendants in the warner suit are sony usa guber 
peters their company and two sony executives walter yetnikoff and 
michael schulhof

eastwick 
warner executives say the two men are involved in about 50 
projects for warner including sequels to batman and movie

the biggest selloff since the crash of 1987 
rocked the stock market friday driving prices into a freefall 
decline following news that a big buyout deal for ual corp had 
fallen through 
the sudden slide came almost exactly two years after a similar 
fridayafternoon rout that preceded black monday on oct 19 1987 
but many wall streeters insisted it was far too soon to declare 
that another collapse was in the making 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials plunged 19058 points 
or 691 percent to 256926 that marked its second biggest point 
drop ever exceeded only by the 508point loss recorded on black 
monday 
on monday of this week the average stood at a record closing 
high of 279141 
the market had been retreating steadily but gradually for most 
of fridays session until the group planning to buy ual said it had 
been unable to get enough bank financing for the transaction it had 
planned 
that quickly cast a pall over shares of ual and other companies 
that have been involved in or are planning debtfinanced deals 
brokers said the news touched a particularly sensitive nerve 
among traders who had been worried lately about problems in the 
market for highyielding junk bonds 
earlier the labor department reported that the producer price 
index of finished goods rose 09 percent in september abruptly 
reversing a series of declines through the summer months 
the ual news was the trigger for the whole thing said 
newton zinder an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc also 
its october memories of 1987 are still very vivid 
but this time its different asserted jim craig portfolio 
manager of the janus fund and the janus venture fund two 
denverbased mutual funds who said he was a heavy buyer of 
selected stocks late friday 
interest rates have been on the decline and 
nontakeoverrelated stocks are not overvalued craig said 
volume on the new york stock exchange totaled 25117 million 
shares up from 16012 million in the previous session and the 
heaviest total since 25487 million were traded on jan 27 
ual shares were down 5 at 279 when trading in them was halted 
in the new york markets after the news of the buyout problem broke 
a dealer at one brokerage firm said the shares were being quoted in 
london in a range of 230 to 240 
among other stocks involved in plans or speculation about 
possible buyout deals or other corporate transactions paramount 
communications fell 7 to 55 delta air lines 7 to 69 warner 
communications 5 to 61 and usx 4 to 33 
as the crunch hit however bluechip issues not involved in any 
takeover talk also took a drubbing international business machines

120 american telephone amp telegraph 2 to 40 and dupont 7 to 113 
as measured by wilshire associates index of more than 5000 
actively traded stocks the market lost 18957 billion or 544 
percent in value 
the nyses composite index of all its listed common stocks 
dropped 1142 to 18556 
declining issues swamped advances by about 11 to 1 in nationwide 
trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 153 up

spooky deja vu pervaded the financial markets as 
a wave of panic selling swept wall street and evoked unsettling 
parallels with the stock crash of october 1987 
the collapse two years ago which rocked the financial markets 
and wiped out around 500 billion in wealth haunted the memories 
of stock traders friday as the market sustained another body blow 
nobody believes in witchcraft but were seeing the same type 
of phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago said 
michael evans a private economist in washington and president of 
evans economics inc obviously people are going to lose some 
money 
fridays drop was of a similar magnitude to the markets slide 
on friday oct 16 1987 three days before black monday the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials tumbled around 190 points or 69 
percent compared with its 108point 4percent slide on oct 16 
the events surrounding the two market breaks show remarkable 
similarities that go well beyond size and the fact that they 
happened at the same time of year at both times for example the 
united states was agonizing over its monetary policy and interest 
rates overseas were headed higher 
in the fall of 1987 it was thentreasury secretary james baker 
and west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg wrangling over 
exchangerate policy in recent weeks the federal reserve and the 
treasury have been squabbling over how to drive down the dollar 
which has defied efforts by the big industrial powers to reduce its 
value 
closer to home its deja vu as the administration wrestles 
again with the intractable budget deficit and inflationary 
pressures 
this time a dispute over the capitalgains tax cut pushed by 
president bush has delayed senate debate on a related 14 billion 
deficitcutting bill unless that legislation is passed by monday 
automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs expected to 
total about 16 billion will take effect 
and inflation is rearing its head the government reported 
friday that a sharp rise in energy costs helped trigger a rebound 
in wholesale price inflation in september wiping out three rare 
monthly declines this summer 
the congressional morass surrounding the capital gains issue is 
reminiscent of the battle two years ago over interest deductions 
for borrowing for corporate takeovers 
mergers and acquisitions a hot issue in late 1987 and redhot 
now played a key role in both situations back then the markets 
fretted that congress would hem in leveraged buyouts with 
restrictions now the ability of their organizers to finance the 
takeovers is being questioned and has the market spooked 
that fear mushroomed into the catalyst for fridays plunge as 
the pilotmanagement group proposed to take over ual corp for 
675 billion admitted that it couldnt secure the needed financing 
on both fridays computerdriven program trading exacerbated the 
panic and swelled the selling wave but it was much more of a 
factor on oct 16 1987 than friday when the ual announcement and 
anxiety over the market for highrisk highyield junk bonds threw 
the market into a nose dive

panic stock selling isnt likely to jolt the 
economy much beyond wall street but if the losses deepen the 
effect could become more profound economists and investors say 
ill sleep just as good tonight as i did last night said g 
b mann a 78yearold retiree from dallas with a portfolio of more 
than 1 million after a panic selloff friday that sent the dow 
jones industrial average to its second steepest singleday point 
loss ever down 19058 to 256926 
he estimated fridays market break cost him 10000 
the oneday loss would likely have little immediate effect on 
most households but if the selling spilled into future sessions 
some economists worried that consumer spending could plunge and the 
health of small businesses could be affected 
for the most part investors especially longtime ones with 
experience with the markets ups and downs seemed unperturbed 
it really will not have a major effect on my lifestyle said 
ernest harden who has a computer software and consulting business 
in jacksonville fla and puts his market holdings at 400000 
at this point im not deeply concerned since im a longterm 
investor im not going to get excited ill ride it through he 
said 
thomas ohara executive director of the national association of 
investors corp the countrys largest group representing small 
investors said he saw little panic among traders in the aftermath 
of fridays losses 
an awful lot of our investors have been here before ohara 
said in an interview in minneapolis where his group was holding a 
convention 
among the new investors youll find some people who are 
definitely disappointed but most of our members werent planning 
on selling their stocks tomorrow he said 
if it stops here the impact will be small said robert 
eisner an economics professor at northwestern university as far 
as the behavior of households the impact would be trivial even 
the huge crash of october 87 had a discernible impact but not an 
enormous effect on household behavior and consumption 
but he and others worried that if the market slump continued 
small businesses trying to raise capital might find that harder 
and sustained stock market losses could eventually take a bite out 
of housing car and durable goods sales 
things can mushroom eisner said i would hope things can 
be stopped quickly 
since oct 19 1987 when the dow average dropped a record 508 
points small investor portfolios have risen 268 percent 
according to money magazines small investor index an average 
annual return of 127 percent 
to me the sad part is that more people will be scared away it 
has a bad effect on the people who just joined the market or were 
thinking of joining it and we need those people said ohara 
avner arbel a cornell university stock market expert said in 
an interview this week that his biggest worry is the impact of 
market losses on small companies which make up about onethird of 
the business market 
he said their stocks are priced relatively high their earnings 
are extremely volatile and their growth in sales and profits is 
generally poor 
small companies really represent the financial future of this 
country arbel said traditionally thats the sector of the 
economy where growth and innovation come from weakness in the 
sector is equivalent to weakness in our youth its highly 
significant for the future 
in an even more pessimistic assessment ravi batra professor of 
international economics at southern methodist university and author 
of the great depression of 1990 said the market plunge could 
augur the coming great depression 
theres an extremely high concentration of debt there are too 
many poor people and too many rich people the ocean of debt is 
very vast

the plunge in stock prices left wall street 
workers dazed grim and debating whether another crash is coming 
monday 
one man stood on a street corner across from the new york stock 
exchange friday shook his head and said to a friend im trying 
to figure out whether i got my head handed to me 
some financial workers went to drown their sorrows at houlihans 
bar around the corner from the exchange 
one trader put down his beer spread his hands two feet apart 
and said ive got a hole in my underwear this big 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 19058 
points friday nearly 200 billion was wiped out from the paper 
value of stocks as more than 250 million shares changed hands 
almost exactly two years ago on friday oct 16 1987 the dow 
jones average dropped 108 points that monday black monday oct 
19 1987 it plummeted 508 points 
some predicted a similar crash next week 
theres going to be a huge selloff on monday said another 
houlihans patron john durand a bank stocks trader 
i thought it was all over two years ago but i never thought 
it would happen again said anthony a stock exchange floor 
reporter who would not give his last name as he left the building 
after fridays closing bell 
i need a drink he added 
but stockbroker bernard klein was defiantly optimistic this 
is not going to be like black monday the market is going to stick 
on monday absolutely what we had today was just panic selling 
thomas flanagan and greg laborde retail stockbrokers having an 
afterwork drink at the south street seaport near wall street said 
fridays drop actually stirred up business 
i got many many buy orders at the close laborde said the 
market drop creates bargains for investors who like to buy when 
prices are low 
laborde dismissed comparisons with the 1987 disaster 
there were a lot more problems with the economy back then 
he said 
this time its nothing really agreed flanagan its just 
an adjustment 
he added were bullish 
options traders larry mendelson and jeff schure were not 
interviewed as they left their offices across the street from 
the stock exchange mendelson said mondays going to be a scary 
day people have all weekend to think about this 
schure added most people took hits today one guy i know went 
down for 150000 
many financial workers pointed to the failed leveraged buyout of 
united airlines parent ual corp as the trigger for the plunge in 
fridays prices 
but another patron of the south street seaport al a bond traer 
who would not give his last name said he thought the ual deal was 
merely a symptom of a deeper illness 
the country is not in the euphoric financial state everyone 
says it is he said weve got a huge deficit and the thrift 
industry is falling apart 
the stock market is like a house of cards he added i see 
more of this happening on monday
